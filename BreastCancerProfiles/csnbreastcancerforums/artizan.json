    "Content": "I am glad that you are using yoga as a tool. Relaxation and getting ones self centered are important. I am sorry that you are experiencing more issues. Dealing with the unknown and the \"what next\" can really make us crazy. I read the book, \"A New Earth\", by Eckhart Tolle when Oprah had it in her book club. He also has a book called the \"Power of Now\" which I have not read. In his books he stresses the idea that nothing exists but this moment. The past is gone and the future has not happened yet. It helped me to realize that I need to live this moment and focus on what I am doing right now. It helps me to disconnect a little bit from being that fearful scared person I am when facing medical issuses. Breathe!!! Hugs!!!",
