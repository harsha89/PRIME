I don't know if this will help but another option (I know someone who did this) is to go to several attorneys for a free consultation (most are free for the first visit) and be sure to ask a different specific question with each one. This helps you to gain knowlege and see where you stand. Also, depending which state you live in, some states are an equal distribution state and a family law master makes a final decision based on the law rather than arguement. The state I live in is like that. Check to see if your state is (ask a lawyer at a consultation). Also, this is a bully tactic your husband's lawyer is performing. If it is a judge or law master that decides, they need to stay reasonable in the end. Unforunately, you will need to retain a lawyer to help you through the legal process. Who knows, if you talk to enough of them, one may take your case for free. Good luck in your situation. :) Pammy",

      "Content": "OK, everyone. I have a change of plans this weekend. My hubby decided to surprise me with a week long get-away to Connecticut (we haven't done anything all year)!! He wants to leave here tonight at midnight when he is done working. I love to be spontaneous, but he forgot how tired I get from Rads still. I haven't even started packing yet (yikes!). Something I can usually pull off in an hour has taken me all day! I mostly made a list, gathered a few essentials and fell asleep. I just woke up and realized I have to get moving. OMG...I took a 5 hour nap! My first nap in 4 months....go figure. Just wanted you to be aware that I would be gone, so no one would worry. I will still probably check in as I will not be able to keep up with them, plus I see myself taking many breaks still. Can't over do it. We are staying with friends of ours (he is a scientist with Brystol-Myers Squibb). He works with Altheimer drugs, but is going to introduce me to a scientist that is working with BC drugs for his field. I am fastinated to hear what will be out there in the future. These are very fasinating men and I just love hearing about the latest breakthroughs. They are usually very serious people, and I have a blast making them laugh. Most of the time, what they are talking about goes \"swoosh\" right over my head. So I just nod and keep ordering Martinis until, all the sudden, I \"get it\". This somehow makes them laugh? They always ask our friend when we will be visiting each year, to make plans to get together with us. So the new \"BC\" drug guy hasn't met me yet! Now picture this....they are taking a country girl out to places that charge $12.00 a drink (gulp!...thats a whole case of beer!) and 4 little half shells, of clam casino, for $18.00. So what happens is, I start ohhh'ing and ahhh'ing at EVERYTHING, and they find this fascinating and fun! They are use to looking at cells and molds all day under a microscope, that it is fascinating to them to watch me enjoy the different cultures with such awe. And it seems that every place we go to always has huge fish tanks, that by the fourth Martini, I am usually talking to the pretty fishy by making funny fishy faces with them. They just usually order me one of those fancy smancy coffe drinks for a change of pace. But guess what....now I'm a WIDE AWAKE drunk!! (And the coffee always has Baileys in it....duh!) Didn't think we were going, but hubby made surprise arrangements. Plus our friends brother, Luigi Cantone, who has done many paintings for alot of famous people, is working on a painting for me!! Yeah! He is hoping to complete it by the time we leave. I have always wanted one of his paintings, but they are thousands of dollars and I can only afford $19.99 walmart specials!! So I am extremely excited to see what he is working on. Well, I better get moving and start packing. I will keep you all in my prayers and think about you often. Many cyber hugs and smiles..... â™¥Pammy",

I was only going to read some, while I took a break, and came across this thread. It wasn't my plan to respond...just read. (By the way, your all having a blast in Connecticut!! Teehee). I think those of you that have gone before me are looked up to with the utmost respect. Your wisdom, kindness, patience in answering our questions over and over again, insight, quidance, and direction onto the right path is sought after and found in you. So many of us value what you have to say. So many of us feel lost until we read a response from you that allows us to breath once again. I couldn't imagine what it would be like if we did not have you all on these boards. I am truly blessed that you are there for me and everyone else. Just your presence gives me a sense of comfort and security in getting through what will probably prove to be the biggest challenge in my life. Thanks for sticking around, while you live life after cancer, to help all us see that someday we too will get to live life after cancer. Thanks for being there for us.

I am nearing my 2nd Cancerversary in a few weeks and of course alot of memories surround this thankful occasion. Life does have a way of slowly creeping back to some form of normalacy and it seems that time starts to go TOO quickly!! What can I say to update you? Well, I recently had a scare last month and underwent lymph node biopsy, but I am happy to announce that they were negative (in my clavical area). Yea....(clapping hands!) Yesterday, however, I became extremely painful in my joints and have had a butterfly rash on my face for several weeks. Doc ran boocoo blood work (along with some specialized test) and I am currently awaiting the results. I did get some relief though, after 2 shots in each butt cheek and 4 scripts from the pharmacy. (Geesh, I'm trying to ditch pills, not add more!) His suspicions? A childhood disease called Parvovirus or Lupus. Parvovirus is spreading among the children alot around here, but the few adults that he has seen contact it are having extreme symptoms. Once you have it (just like chicken pox) you become immune to it. Wish cancer could be that way! I haven't even begun to think about the possibility of Lupus. I'll wait on the test results first. I am still working on accepting the fatigue that will never go away, the weight gain that I can't lose, the dry skin, the hot flashes, the night sweats, the lack of energy, the ridged nails, and the fact that trying NOT to eat ice-cream on any diet is just plain torture to myself. Therefore, I will embrace the ice-cream diet without guilt! In case you were wondering what the ice-cream diet was....every diet I am on will INCLUDE ice-cream! (giggling...) I have not been here in so long that I hope all of you are hanging in there the best you can. I would love to hear how you have been doing. Having Cancer sucks, but when you think about it, we really have no choice but to accept it and embrace it. Do the best we can, which is not always easy. The hardest thing for me was to get back my ability to giggle. As positive as I stayed, I was sad when I realized that having cancer was robbing me of my one pleasure in life....laughter. But I regained 99% of that back and I will keep that as a victory over this ugly disease! Hope and hugs to everyone, â™¥Pammy",

My problem is that I have been having flank pain on my left side in my back that has not gone away. Thought the Arimedex may have been responsible, but I guess not. I'm worried. They did find some blood in my urine. But so far, that's it. I am sorta on a hold because our new Insurance starts on the first and requires authorizations. Can't get in for too many test before that. So need to wait till the first to get things set up. My question....has anyone experienced this type of pain? Dull, achy, and constant.

      "Content": "Hi everybody. Just came back from Rads and I am bumming out. Hubby and I had a spat over the hail damage and Insurance Company sending their person whom also does the repairs in the area. That's fine except I intend to get several estimates. I have never heard of this company and also I have the added expense of having several other layers of shingles removed before new can be put down. How do I know that I am getting the best price? I think that he is feeling sooooo stressed (me too) that we are having a difficult time talking about problems that would otherwise be handled differently. I felt bad because after he snapped at me (which is so rare) I refused to look at him. He would not let me get out of the car until I gave him a kiss and let him apologize. I still didn't say a word. I went in. I know my tech could tell I was not my usual self. When I was done this time she said the nurse needed to see me. I was all prepared with a speech thinking my tech was just concerned with my mood. Whew....all the nurse wanted to do was check my skin. Which she says is looking pretty good. It's just a tad pink and stings a little, off and on, but nothing really happening yet. As for my hubby, he apologized several times. He's forgiven but I still feel like crap. Darn, what a crappy day this turned out to be. Guess you'll have those now and then, huh? :) Pammy",

If she did not have the results on that pathology report, she should have called for a final path report prior to mapping out your treatment. (I personally would run from someone like this!!!) Sometimes this test is done as part two and is an addition to the initial report. It may be listed seperately. If it was not done, then insist on it. All laboratories keep a sample on a slide of your speciman for future testing (or to send to other labs for genetic testing. etc). If you have no choice but to stay with this Oncologist, then I certainly would stand up and start making demands. Take someone with you if you have to. This is your life and it is not eligable for any guessing games!!! Good luck and please let us know what you find out!! :) Pammy",

We talked about it and have decided in my case against it. But I urge everyone, if your Doc ok's it, to get your flu shots now. Doc said going around early and quickly and unless you have A-1 immune system, you will most likely catch it. Yikes!! In all total in the past 4 months, I have gained 14 pounds!! No more ice-cream for me! (boohoo) He told me not to worry about it. But I do!! OMG...my hubby feel asleep! My Doc and I talked for hours! The office was closed and locked up when we left! He is so thrilled that I am so up to date on all the stuff out there, when it comes to this disease. We spent 45 minutes on the internet alone, just looking up what drugs I could have while on Tamoxifen. He was going to put me on a script to help me sleep when I asked \"is it compatible with the Tamoxifen?\". He said \"lets look it up\"....was shocked when he discovered so many drugs were not available for me. Said it was a great thing I brought it to his attention as he did not know. He also advised me to be careful what drugs I take as Tamoxifen can mess up your cholesterol and so can some other drugs. You don't ever want to take meds that do this at the same time. He knows I run everything past my Medical Onc before taking anyway. He does look out for me though. Said he researched and helped his Mom get past BC around 2003 and he is amazed how much has changed. Gotta love him though, he was unrelenting and found something for me to try. It is a muscle relaxant called \"Zanaflex\". I'll take it at bedtime and see if this doesn't do the trick. Oooohhh....and then we had the BIG talk about lack of libido. Wanted to know if I thought it was from Tamoxifen or more a mental/emotional issue? I thought not from the Tamoxifen, as I have had so much done to me, that I haven't even thought about sex! He said \"don't worry, since YOU can't take the antidepressant, we'll put your hubby on them, and then he won't care your not having sex!\". Nothing like leaving his office laughing hysterically!! â™¥Pammy",

I was afraid that maybe the large dose of calcium and vitamin D may have been the culprit, but they didn't bother me prior to taking the Tamoxifen. But sometimes it takes a while to work on your system. My body is trying everything to reject this drug, but I really want to give it a chance. As a result, I am losing a few pounds (which is ok) but at the same time, need to keep my healing going with proper nutrition. Here's what really blew my mind....I am having a difficult time drinking water too! Haven't found anything I feel like drinking.

I really hate to make it sound like all our problems can be fixed from a pill bottle, but under these circumstances, why go through anything more than we have to? Please post and let us know how you are. (:-) Pammy",

You gave me such a fuzzy warm feeling by missing me! I miss everyone too!! I really, really need a few more hours in the day to do all the things I want to!! Which would include posting here daily. I think my life after cancer has gotten busier than prior! I am back to work full time!! We are very, very busy and I, too, am addicted to FB. (Sigh)...It at least creates a harmless escape! I invite everyone to try it! Then you can be my neighbor!! (nooooooo....I am NOT cheating by inviting hundreds of people at one time!). Tuesday I go for my first mammo and check up with all my Docs in Pittsburgh. I am staying positive on the results. Alright, you caught me! I am shaking in my boots (that would be if I was actually wearing boots, I would be shaking in them!). I am having PT done on my arm starting next week. Absolutely LOVE the Ortho Doc!! Even though he used a 10 foot needle into my joint! OK, that wasn't true....it was only 8 foot!! I am struggling with the fatique (post treatment) and struggling with trying to lose the 15lb weight gain from the past year. There has to be a way to diet WITHOUT giving up ice-cream!! I hope everyone is hanging in there! Hubby is starring at me b/c we were getting ready to run to the store when I said, \"wait! There is something I have to do or I will forget.\" Here I am 15 minutes later still typing away!! I am sending all of you gigantic cyber hugs!! Take care and I will try to pop in more than once a month!! â™¥Pammy",

The MRI showed a completely different story & turned out to be accurate (confirmed by core needle biopsy). So here I am finally getting a needle biopsy first & needing the lumpectomy anyway!! But had they done needle biopsies on me the last 7 times, I would have been spared a whole lot more since they were always benign....go figure?",

Then in 5 minutes, tell yourself you will wait just 5 more minutes. Then wait again. Eventually, you find yourself going longer than 5 minutes without realizing it and in no time the craving actually goes away temporarily.

So that everytime you move or poke the area, it 'pulls' on the tissue and causes pain. It only takes the slightest touch to 'move' the tissue that doesn't want to 'give'. To me, it's like having PMS in that boobie ALL the time...ache, ache, ache! So now I am in the process of learning to live with it in case it never goes away (which is a possibility). It can be an unfortunate long term side effect of radiation. Hope yours gets better with time... â™¥Pammy",

Crisp white sheets covered the bed. Two leather chairs for sitting were off to the side. Crash cart and medical equipment scattered about the room reminded you that you were still in a hospital. If it wasn't for the obvious, she could have pretended she was somewhere else; anywhere else. The nurse was giving her instructions. \"Take everything off except your underwear. Put the first gown on so that it ties in the back. Put the second gown on, like a robe, so that it ties in the front. These are for your feet. This is to put over your hair; but we'll worry about that later. When your all done, open the curtain and I will be back for your clothes. Any questions?\" Pammy thought to herself that she had a million and one questions but none that required an immediate answer. So she simply said, \"No\". The nurse left and she turned to Bill. \"Well, if I had known I was going to be leaving my underwear on, I would have worn a fancier pair!!\" He responded with \"If it would make you feel better maybe I could run out and find you something different....how about something in hot pink?\" This made her laugh. He helped her change and then pulled the step stool out from under the table so she could take her place on the bed. Then he opened the curtain and sat down in one of the chairs to wait. Pammy was much better at waiting then he was. He began to tap his fingers on the arm of the chair. It wasn't long before the nurse came back. With her she brought an elderly gentleman & a wheelchair. \"Looks like you are scheduled for a guided needle and sentinal node injection all the way on the other side of the hospital. So if you just have a seat, we'll be happy to take you for a ride. Once we get this out of the way, we'll bring you back here for your surgery? Do you need to use the bathroom?\" Pammy thought to herself, bathroom? I have willing starved and deprived myself of all liquids so I can let someone I barely know cut me up and you want to know if I need to use the bathroom? Not unless I want to stick my head in the toilet, she thought. I'm dehydrated!! She quietly answered, \"No\". \"Well then, your off. Bill, you can go with her. We will see the two of you back in about an hour\". And away we went, the same way we came in. Down the hall, around the corner, to the right, past the waiting room...... Bill and the elderly gentleman made small talk as Bill held open doors, pressed elevator buttons, and moved obstacles out of the way. It was a 15 minute walk to radiology and Pammy was hoping it would be more like 15 miles. She was not looking forward to this part of her ordeal. With every exit door they passed, she thought about leaping out of the chair and taking off. But instead she sat silent and let them wheel her to the other side. She closed her eyes and silently said over & over again...\"Please, Lord, do not let this hurt!\" After repeating this thru the last set of doors, she opened her eyes and there he was!! Stay tuned for chapter 3.......",
