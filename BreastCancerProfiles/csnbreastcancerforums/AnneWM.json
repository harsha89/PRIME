    "Content": "Hi, I am undergoing my Taxol chemo cycles after just completing my AC chemo cycles. I have tumor in left breast with one also in my lymph nodes. My treatment plan incudes a modified masectomy of left breast only at end of April followed by hormone therapy. I want to have both breasts removed even though the right breast so far shows no cancer. I do not want to go through this again but my doctors don't want to remove both breasts. Has anyone been is this situation? I am so afraid that the cancer will develop in the other breast. Do I have a right to have both removed?",
