      "Content": "I used to feel that there was too much hype and attention on breast cancer as well...until I got it! When I was first diagnosed with a rectal cancer, I was amazed how I had no sources to share my misery with. I was almost resentful of all the attention on breast cancer/ There was breast cancer forums everywhere, but nothing on anal/rectal. In the infusion rooms I felt like I was the new kid sitting at the lunch table alone...everyone else had things in common. Then I had a secondary lung cancer. Decided I would devote my fundraising efforts to Relay for Life as it supported ALL cancers. After being diagnosed this year with breast cancer however, I have to say I'm happy to see all the support. I just think it's important to do something for this disease, whichever one you choose to support. I know only a portion actually goes toward research, treatment, etc.....but it all helps!!!",

You'll be glad you're a candidate! I watched it twice so far....once with my boyfriend and once with my daughters. It's an amazing drug!!! Just wish I felt the same about all this chemo floating through me~ GOOD LUCK!!!",

      "Content": "I asked the same question! I was so trying to avoid either chemo or radiation. Like someone else said though radiation is a piece of cake compared to chemo...but looking at a year ahead of chemo, herceptin, lumpectomy, then radiation, and hormone replacement seems a bit daunting......but I saw the charts and got the scolding of what if I chose to NOT do one and have come to terms with it all! Will be my second time for chemo and rad, so at least I know what to expect! We HAVE to do what we ultimately believe is going to help us...whatever that choice may be.",

They gave me Lorazpam for anti anxiety and nausea and it makes me sleep like a baby at night. You need your sleep so let your onc know right away that you can't sleep. Wishing you well!!!",

Need to hear that some of you are glad you made that decision. I think I'm mentally prepared, but wonder if we really can be. Just hoping I don't wake up and then have it hit me!! Thanks everyone for helping me along the way and for your support and prayers as I head in to surgery!!",
