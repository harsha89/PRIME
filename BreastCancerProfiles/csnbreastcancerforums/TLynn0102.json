      "Content": "Mine came out after the third treatment. Had the hubby give me a buzz cut which he thought was just wrong in itself, but after the first swipe he was okay with it because I was laughing. Didn't want to make things worse. About a week later it came out in the shower, in clumps and for some reason it hurt. My oncologist could not explain that. I used a really good conditioner on the little I had left throughout the treatment and it kept my scalp nice and I did not experience any problems. My aunt did not have any of her hair fall out during chemo, guess I didn't get that gene! The best was when it started to grow back, it felt like a baby's hair all soft and smooth.",

      "Content": "I am sorry to hear about your sister. This site will give you a wealth of knowledge and understanding to what she and your family will begin to go through as you take this journey with her. Support is a major key in the battle. If you cannot be there call her a couple times a week to see how she is doing. Cards are really nice too. If you are able to be there even for a short time see if you can cook a bunch of meals that can be frozen and pulled out and popped in the oven. Hugs, kisses and a good cry is healthy too. You may want to ask her if there is anything you can do for her. Keep reading the site and posting your questions, everyone here is wonderful and very helpful. Tracey",

I had forgotten through the chemo that the calendar rolled and I became a year older. Imagine my expression when I realized I was not really the age I thought I was! I am blaming that on the medicine!",
