    "Content": "Hi! I am Fawn's sister-in-law - I actually told her about this site, so every now and then I read the posts. (I do this not to be nosy, but mostly to learn!) Anyway, I don't think Fawn told you all - she recently participated in a Breast Cancer walk. With the help of her Aunt Donna and many others, she raised over $2,000 for research. I have watched her go from victim to survivor - learning, helping others, and really getting involved. I am so proud of you Fawn! Hang in there! Love, Lisa",
