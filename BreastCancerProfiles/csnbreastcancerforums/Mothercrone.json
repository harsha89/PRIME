      "Content": "I know the board has talked about fingernail side effects in the past, and I've tried to read all the topics but I'm wondering... For those of you who's fingernails turned black, bled and fell off, how did you handle that? That's where I am right now. The nails have not fallen off yet but they are loose and naturally I've stubbed them a few times. Sometimes I bandage the fingers but mostly I wear those cheap latex fitted surgery gloves to stave off infections and minimize the sheer ugliness of it all, especially in public. Nail polish is no longer an option. I did much better going bald as I was totally expecting that. The Taxotere Disgusto Nails came as a complete surprise and I'm not dealing with that very well, only because my fingers are there for me to see and use every moment. Very self-conscious of my fingers and, in fact, they make me quite ill just to look at them. I know it's only temporary but I'm still in treatment. Any ideas? Thanks for your suggestions. pat â™¥",
