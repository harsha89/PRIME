    "Content": "Ok, surgery set up for next month. I think I remember my surgeon saying if the margins are clear we are done & if there was more dcis then radiation will be needed. I heard that radiation trmts can only be done once so my question is if you have radiation & god forbid it the Dcis cells return wouldn't your only possible option at that point be a masectomy? I know I will have to ask this question to my Dr but I'm throwing it out there anyway.... Do you think you could postpone radiation? I have read the side effects of tamoxifen & saw blood clots & uterine cancer are possible. Since blood clots run in my family that to me sounds like I'd be playing Russian roulette. All these years of research...... millions of women with this.... why such limited choices? We can walk on the moon but we can't find a cure for this horrible disease??????? Sorry just my mind racing with thoughts again.",
