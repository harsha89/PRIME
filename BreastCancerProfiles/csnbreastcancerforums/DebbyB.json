      "Content": "I had dizzy spells for the first year after chemo.  I didn't take the time to take care of myself.  I worked during chemo and rads and I was working 50 hours a week right afterwards (think at the time I was apologizing to my boss for getting cancer and trying to make up for it?)  Give yourself a break and time to heal.  :)   I was worried about every ache and pain afterwards, its normal.  Looking back, I wish I hadn't been so hard on myself to get back to normal.  Take your time to heal.  Your body and mind have been through a lot.",
