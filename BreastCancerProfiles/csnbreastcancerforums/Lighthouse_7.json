I'm sorry if I sound a little mushy but this board and you ladies have helped me beyond all my expectations. I thought we might list just a few things that meant so much to each of us so we can all see how important this group of Kindred Spirits is. If it's okay, let's not mention names but just the help that we got. Thanks and LOVE YOU again! 1. I learned that it's okay to vent, cry, complain and be good myself. 2. I learned to be accepted here when others couldn't understand. 3. I learned that most of us know more than doctors because we have lived it. (not medical of course, but all the rest) 4. I know that I wish I had found this site sooner and not when treatment was done. 5. I know that I could never be without all of you ever again in my life.",

I try not to let it bother me now ( noticed I said TRY ) because they love us and don't want to hear that we still might be \"sick\". In their minds, if we don't talk about it and we are finished with treatment, well than everything is fine. This is not to say that there aren't insensitive people out there because there sure are.

      "Content": "Dear Terry, For me I did NOT want chemo at all. I even tried to bargain with the doctors and said, take my breast if I don't have to have chemo. I had Stage 3 invasive with 8 nodes infected. I was a good candidate for lumpectomy because the tumor (2.6) was confined in the duct. But my bargaining didn't work, LOL now I can laugh....I was told chemo was necessary to kill any remaining cells that might be hiding. I am 55 years old but still was petrified of chemo. Well, I am happy to tell you that it was not that bad. I think we can scare ourselves by a lot of research and horror stories, but it has come such a long way in recent years and they have wonderful medicine that counteracts any nausea that might come your way. The worse thing is that you do get tired, but heck, we can manage that for years of living, right? I would say to have it if your doctor recommends it and enjoy many years to come. I am now cancer free (thank God) and feeling much better. I finished chemo and radiation on December 22, 2009. God Bless with whatever decision you make and know that we are all here for you. Prayers are sent your way. Wanda",

They started me with an aloe one and then gave me a stronger one as the weeks progressed. Every week they would ask if I needed more. They were very helpful. If they don't offer it where you go, just ask for it. It isn't RX but I believe they provide it. I also had something called Wound Care that I only needed for any open wounds. Best of luck, Wanda",

Just too far to travel everyday ( 1 hour ). I am sorry that you have to travel that far. Is there anywhere closer that you could have it? That is probably making you want to opt out more than anything. I was lucky to find a center closer that was affilliated with my Boston Hospital. As far as any other reason to opt out, I would not. If they say you need it, than I think you should. This is just my opinion but, I know how it was explained to me...as follows. Chemo will kill cancer cells (as well as good ones) but radiation will kill any lingering cells that might not be visable or detected yet. The little buggers can be hiding just waiting to attatch to something and spread. That's why that don't just radiate your affected area, but go beyond it's margins as well. There is no pain at all in radiation, just some fatigue, but we've dealt with that before! As long as you keep applying cream ( they give it to you ) twice a day, you shouldn't burn. I got red at times and it went away. Once when they radiated up to my collar bone and side of my neck, I did burn but not anything like black skin or anything, just stayed red and hot for a few weeks. BUT that was actually my fault, you see, I didn't know they were going up that high and I never applied the cream up there. I probably should have asked more questions in that area. If I had applied the cream in that spot, I bet I wouldn't have had any problem. It is always your decision in the end, but like a friend once told me, Radiation is a piece of cake after chemo. Best of luck whatever you decide. Keep us posted. Wanda",

My scalp stopped hurting and I didn't have to watch it fall it anymore. It also made ME in control, not my disease. Good luck, it is hard to go through that, but try to make the best of it. I wore extra makeup and larger earrings to make me feel feminine because my hair always did that for me. After a while I liked the ease of getting ready in the morning, no blow drying or straightening irons. I did miss my hair but got in a routine with scarfs and turbans. I bought 2 wigs although never wore them much because I was more comfy in scarfs. Might as well make the most of it while you are going through it was my thought process. My treatments ended in Dec 0f 09 and I have quite a bit of hair now. It came back curly so if I want straight, I'm right back at the iron. :) The longer it gets, the less curl is there. I have given my hat box to another woman going through hair loss now and still another loves one of my wigs (blonde) just to have fun! I have always had dark hair. I can honestly say that I wouldn't wear these items again because if I ever need chemo again, I will treat myself to all NEW hats and scarfs. I figure I deserve it! Hugs, Wanda",
