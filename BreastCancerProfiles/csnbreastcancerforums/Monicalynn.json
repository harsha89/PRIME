      "Content": "I had my third chemo on the 30th, my next one is the 20th, I get them once every three weeks. Day four and five after infusion is when i'm most fatigued and nap off and on all day. My house shows my fatigue but I let it be. How many more infusions do you have? You will get through it. Like the others said if they insist on coming over keep the visits short. I let my friends know which days are the most tiring for me and they let me rest. I say its ok to sit down to rest and fall asleep, I do that to :) Sit down in the recliner for a min and wake up two hours later, I guess its the way of the body saying to take a break and I know I sleep hard becuase I have woke up with drool on my chin a few times lol",
