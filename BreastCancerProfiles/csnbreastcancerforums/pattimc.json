I told my husband about it (he thinks you're all pretty great, too!) and he's going to light a candle with me tonight at 7:00. I work for a religious congregation (nuns) and one of the sisters gave me this prayer when she heard I had breast cancer. I don't want to offend anyone, and this is just a suggestion but I think it's pretty special: In the comfort of your love, I pour out to you my Savior The memories that haunt me, The anxieties that perplex me, The fears that stifle me, The sickness that prevails upon me, And the frustration of all the pain that weaves about me. Lord, help me to see your peace in my turmoil, Your compassion in my sorrow, Your forgiveness in my weakness, And your love in my need. Touch me O Lord, with your healing power and strength. My husband and I will be saying this prayer tonight and thinking of all my sisters in pink! Patti",

First of all, the surgery was very simple and this was after having my lumpectomy, re-excision, sentinel lymph node biopsy and axillary dissection. I didn't hesitate a minute about having it put in. It was taken out in the hospital but not in a surgical area. In fact, my husband was in there with me. Everyone is different (how many times have you heard that on this forum???) but my veins are horrible and they used it for chemo and all my blood draws. I had it taken out May of 2010 so it was in about 1 year! Good luck with whatever decision you make!!",
