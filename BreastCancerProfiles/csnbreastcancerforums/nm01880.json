    "Content": "I just finished my 12 week Chemo/Herceptin treatment for my triple positive breast tumor.  Tumor size was <1 cm>, lumpectomy showed clear margins, no lymph node involvement.  Because it was HER2 positive, it required me to go through Chemo.  I breezed through Chemo without any problem, my hair did not fall out which was a surpirse because I was told all body hair would go.  I'm on maintenance now for Herceptin, ending next July.  I'm starting my radiation now for the next 6.5 weeks.   I trust my oncologist with my life.  Please get a second opinion.  ",
