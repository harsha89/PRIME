      "Content": "Hi, Anet, I still have my tissue expanders in from last year. Didn't have the implants (going with saline) put in yet because I had other health issues. My plastic surgeon told me that after I had the expanders expanded (I didn't get them put in until a year after the bilateral) they would start to soften up after a few months. He wanted them to rest for at least two months after the expansion before he would put the implants in. The expanders really didn't soften up significantly for about 4-5 months. I don't know much about capsule contracture. I see the surgeon again in April after I get a check-up from the onc and a ct scan to look at my lungs. I'll know where I am in the process then. Hope all turns out well for you. Keep us all posted. Becky",

Just the fact that you are writing suggests that you need to go have it looked at. When in doubt, find someone to ease your mind--don't care if they laugh or not. And no, you are not paranoid! Your perception is your reality. Hope it checks out fine.",
