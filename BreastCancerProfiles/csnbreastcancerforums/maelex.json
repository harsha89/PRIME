    "Content": "I am new to this forum.  I was diagnosed with stage II breast cancer in August, 2002.  I had a lumpectomy, followed by 8 rounds of chemo (4 Adriamycin and 4 Cytoxin), then about 10 weeks of radiation.  I was doing fine until earlier this year when I went to the ER with chest pains and shortness of breath.  They did EKGs and CT-scan, but said everything was normal and sent me home. Three weeks later, the chest pain and shortness of breath were so bad that I went to the ER again.  This time they determined I had fluid on my lungs.  After an echocardiogram, it was determined I had idiopathic cardiomyopathy.  I'm now on four new meds and the cardiologist is pushing for me to get a defibrillator inserted in my chest.  Is there anyone here who was also diagnosed with this problem after chemo - especially after ten years?     ",
