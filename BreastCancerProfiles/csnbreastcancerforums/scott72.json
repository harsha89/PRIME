      "Content": "Hi Eva, Me and my wife both did chemo. I had a port and she did not. I highly recommend a port. Especially with smaller veins. Sometimes your vein will collapse and it becomes a pain. Hers wasnt to big of a problem but a ports just so much easier. Another good reason is that if anything changed and your oncologist decided you did need one, you would already have it. Its not a bad surgery at all but when your taking chemo you just dont need any added stress. Stay as positive as u can and make sure to eat right. Thats my advice. You will beat it! Scott",
