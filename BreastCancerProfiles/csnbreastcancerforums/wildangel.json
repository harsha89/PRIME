      "Content": "Hi Dee, Yes I did have funny sensations where the pads were put on my \"bad\"arm. I thought it was from the adhesive. But it felt numb and tingly at the same time and I had round circle marks for about 4 hours later on the arm but not on the other places they put those pads. It went away and hasn't bothered me since. Angela",

I take over the counter stuff like advil and alleve, but I can't tolerate them on an empty stomach or if I lie down after taking them. I am sorry you feel bad. We are too young to feel this old!

      "Content": "Hi, Yes, my eyes are more sensitive to light too. And I also developed a retinal blood clot behind my left eye. The doctor tells me that cancer and chemo changes the viscosity ( sp?) of the blood. I had had superficial blood clots in my arm from the node removal but this is a more serious blood clot. My symptoms were a smudge thing infront of that eye. Like I had on glasses and there was a big fingerprint on them. I am on Plavix now and am told I have to be on it indefinitely. The clot has not gotten any worse. If it does I might lose the vision in that eye. So the Plavix is keeping it stable. Check out everything that doesn't seem right. Chemo can also cause hearing loss too! Funny how no one metions this stuff isn't it? Good luck to you! Angela",

      "Content": "Ok- I think I need help. Can you tell me what I am doing wrong or right? My normal day I will have one cup of coffee, a bowl of high fiber cereal (8-10 grams) with fat free Lactaid milk. I don't eat lunch. For dinner I will have whole wheat pasta with tomatoes from my garden mixed in with olive oil and herbs around 4 times a week, sometimes a bowl of new potatoes or sweet potatoes with carrots or brocolli, and then maybe twice a week some roasted chicken or some shrimp. I only drink tap water. Today I had a little accident and had 5 oatmeal raisin cookies. I use Splenda sweetener. I am ER-. I know that cancer is started by a gene mutation but something has to get that started (sugar? fats?) and that is why I am trying everything I can to stop that process from repeating itself! I had a very aggressive tumor and the docs all scared me about that fact combined with the ER- factor. You all seem to know a whole lot more about nutrition than me. I do CHEAT. I never met a candy bar I didn't like. And don't even get me started on ice cream. But I don't keep anything in my house. I rarely eat ice cream but candy and the occasional cookie will come home with me. I used to eat almonds every day because someone told me that they fight cancer and then my doc told me to stop. Believe it or not- WITH THIS DIET- my cholesterol is 257! Before chemo it was 145! I went to the pharmacy today and the pharmacist told me that distilled water would be bad for me to drink all the time! How can that be? Thanks for any opinions! Angela",

      "Content": "I have heard about sugar and cancer before but I heard it in the context of when you get a PET scan they inject you with a sugar isotope and if there is cancer present it will \"go to it\" or something like that. I have always heard that all refined foods, white flour, sugar, proscessed breads, etc are very unhealthy. BUT here is where I am so confused... When I was 15 I stopped eating meat. I ate all veggies and grains etc. I stayed away from liquor, I never smoked and in my entire family tree I am the ONLY PERSON who got cancer! My brother used to tease me that what I really needed was a cheeseburger and beer. Now I eat a mostly plant based, whole foods diet. I do have chicken from time to time and sometimes a lamb chop. I found the only way my hair grew back was to add some more protein. I don't do soy and technically I could because I am ER/PR - but I have heard that ER/PR + girls should steer clear of all soy products. But I must admit- I have a weakness and sometimes I give in to that Peppermint Patty or that box of Goodnplenty. Today I bought a bag of mini chocolates shaped like pumpkins. I don't do it all the time. And I know I shouldn't. I am not overweight so that is ok. I also drink tap water. I better stop that because that is all I drink. But WHERE do you buy distilled water? And what does it taste like? I don't buy bottled water because that is usually tap water put in a fancy bottle. I have no idea if I am acidic or alkaline. Hey I will do anything to prevent this disease from coming back. But I really can't have a Skittle now and then? Well any info about where one gets distilled water and how you know if you are alkaline would be appreciated. Thanks, Angela",

To get BACK to the topic I live in the NY area and the M&Ms are not available yet here. Believe me I looked!

      "Content": "Hi, I have not had this diagnosis - just regular BC without the her2Nue but I do know a few people who have- BUT none of them were lucky to have such a small tumor so that is a DEFINITE PLUS! Also the fact that you had no lymph involvement is a GREAT thing! The norm for most BC survivors is three month check - ups for a while then you graduate to 6 month and then a year. That is with your oncologist. You will need to have your remaining breast Mammo-ed...some docs do it at 9 months- some at a year. When you are having your follow- up appointments you will have blood drawn and Tumor Markers will be taken...this tests if there is a level of BC increasing in your blood...however, this test causes more grief than good most of the time because something as simple as a cold or drinking coffee before the test can falsely elevate the numbers. You will most likely have a PET and or a CT scan to follow up also. Some docs do this right away so they have a \"baseline\" to compare future scans to. I personally think your prognosis is excellent even with the Her2Nue status. You are in a really high cure rate percentile. If you are not on anything now I guess you are ER/PR-? me too. I wish you the best of luck! I hope I helped a little! Angela",
