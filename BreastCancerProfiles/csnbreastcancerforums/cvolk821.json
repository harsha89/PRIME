      "Content": "I'm new to this site, and new to the experience. I've read all of these postings - some have frightened the fool out of me, others have provided an insight I desparately need. Ok, veterans, can you give a rookie a hand? I have been diagnosed with ILC (Invasive Lobular) and am scheduled for a bilateral mastectomy next Thursday with reconstruction. I know all of our experiences are unique, but would like to know: 1.What were your experiences directly following surgery. How long should I arrange for help after surgery? 2. How did you feel two weeks after your surgery - as in should I make plans for Thanksgiving? 3. Do you find it exhausting managing the drama for the people who love you? I'll be coming back to you for more advice, oh wise ones. I'm only beginning...",

I've been able to use it all through my recovery, because it includes everything from gentle step and yoga to marching and slolum skiing. I've lost 41 lbs while on Tamoxifen - but have to work at it every day. Remember, the Tamoxifen makes you want to eat the world, but it doesn't put the fork in your hand. My worst problem with Tamoxifen (discounting having to stand in front of the open freezer with my sweating head on the ice bin) is crying over nothing. Coffee commercials, the pledge of allegence, kids singing.... you name it and I'll cry over it. Do you have any of this crying nonsense?",

It didn't hurt at all. Plastic Surgeon says if they flatten out on me just let him know and he'll do an injection to perk them up and get them back to waving to Jesus. Apparently, women with perfectly healthy breasts get this injection to perk up their nipples. OUCH! At least I couldn't feel it at all.",
