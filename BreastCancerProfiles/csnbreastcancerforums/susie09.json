Therefore, it is important to refresh your memory on the etiquette of this sublime outdoor cooking as it's the only type of cooking a real man will do, probably because there is an element of danger involved. When a man volunteers to do the Barbecue, usually on a Saturday, the following chain of events is put into motion: Barbecue Routine 1) The woman buys the food. 2) The woman makes the salad, prepares the vegetables, and makes dessert. 3) The woman prepares the meat for cooking, places it on a tray along with the necessary cooking utensils and sauces, and takes it to the man who is lounging beside the grill - beer in hand.barbeque jokes Here comes the important part: 4) THE MAN PLACES THE MEAT ON THE GRILL. More routine.... 5) The woman goes inside to organise the plates and cutlery. 6) The woman comes out to tell the man that the meat is burning. He thanks her and asks if she will bring another beer while he deals with the situation. Important again: 7) THE MAN TAKES THE MEAT OFF THE GRILL AND HANDS IT TO THE WOMAN. More routine..... 8) The woman prepares the plates, salad, bread, utensils, napkins, sauces and brings them to the table. 9) After eating, the woman clears the table and does the dishes. And most important of all: barbeque jokes 10) Everyone PRAISES the MAN and THANKS HIM for his cooking efforts. 11) They tell good old Aussie barbie jokes like: Question: What do you call a boomerang that wont come back? Answer: A stick. 12) The man asks the woman how she enjoyed 'her night off.' And, upon seeing her annoyed reaction, concludes that there's just no pleasing some women....",

One's for me and one's for this little guy here,\" and he pulls a tiny three inch man out of his pocket. The bartender asks \"He can drink?\" \"Oh, sure. He can drink.\" So the bartender pours the shots and sure enough, the little guy drinks it all up. \"That's amazing\" says the bartender. \"What else can he do, can he walk?\" The man flicks a quarter down to the end of the bar and says, \"Hey, Jake. Go get that.\" The little guy runs down to the end of the bar and picks up the quarter. Then he runs back down and gives it to the man. The bartender is in total shock. \"That's amazing\" he says, \"what else can he do? Does he talk?\" The man says \"Sure he talks, hey, Jake, tell him about that time we were in Africa and you made fun of that witch doctor's powers!\"",
