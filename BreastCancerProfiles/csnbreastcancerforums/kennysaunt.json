    "Content": "I realize this is the breast cancer chat room but I need advice about how to help those directly involved when cancer strikes. My 5 year old nephew was recently diagnosed with a rare form of cancer and has a long road ahead of him. Unfortunately I live 15 hours away. I need any suggestions from those of you who have been there or are going through this now, on how I can help the family and the cancer patient. I know there are long stays in the hospital and many trips to the hospital/doctors. Besides lots of prayer, what can I do? What would have been helpful to help you get through this whole ordeal? Thank you.",
