    "Content": "Hi Everyone, Its been awhile sence I wrote. I am doing great. I finished my last radition treatment yesterday. It felt so good. Now I go see my radition Doctor in a month to see how the burn is doing , plus my oncology Doctor every 3 months. It is such a relief to know I do not have to go in every day. I am staying positive and moving on. I am back to work but just a few hours a day for now. I so missed my clients. It is so good to be with people again. Not having to worry about being around people that are sick. Its great to be the one to be able to take care of others then just yourself. I have to cut it short but want you all to know your in my prayers and stay positive. Many hugs to you all Leanne",
