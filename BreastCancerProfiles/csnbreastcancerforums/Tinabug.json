      "Content": "Hi Kimberly, I am also fairly new to this site. I had a bilateral mastectomy on Nov 23 with expanders inserted. Monday marked my 6th week & today my plastic surgeon told me I can start exercising but to ease into it. He & my oncologist, suggested walking. The only complication I had was fluid build up which delayed my first expander fill. At this point, I only have (2) more expander fills & I will be finshed with that part of reconstruction. I have also gained weight...10 lbs to be exact. However, I was told not to do anything until now, because my expanders would rub against my chest wall & could cause calluses or make the scar tissue worse, cause bleeding, or cause the expanders to move downward. As I am sure you have been told, everyone is different. Your best bet is, to call your plastic surgeon's office & ask them. I know it's hard...losing our breasts & gaining weight on top of it has been a drag to say the least & I'm about to lose my hair. However, we are cancer free & that is more important than anything. Hooray for you...no more cancer treatment!!!! It is such wonderful news to hear. Hugs, Tina",

      "Content": "Hi PDV, I am glad you found this site, but sorry for the reason. As you can probably tell, these women are amazing & can hold your hand & give wonderful advice. I found it in Oct when I was diagnosed with stage 1 bc. I found the lump, had mammogram, ultra sound mammogram, & core needle biopsy. Unfortunately, it only showed precancerous cells so I had to have a surgical biopsy/lumpectomy, which revealed bc. I had a bilateral mastectomy with expanders on Nov 23. I started my 1st round of 4 rounds of chemo yesterday. When the chemo is over, the expanders will be replaced with silicone implants & I will start tamoxifin for 5 yrs. I know first hand how overwhelming it is...from the mammogram to every single decision you will have to make afterwards. The words \"you have breast cancer\" changed my life forever. However, it is all doable & worth every second of my life it gives me. It has changed my life, in many ways & I'm certain it will continue to do so. Not all of the changes have been for the worse. I got married on the 14th of Oct & was diagnosed on the 26th of Oct...not exactly how I wanted to start out my marriage. However, my husband & I have decided to fight this as aggressively as possible...we refer to it as a speed bump. We chose a wonderful team of doctors: surgeon, plastic surgeon, & oncologist & we have put our faith in God & trust in them. I wish you luck in making any decisions you have to make. However, under no circumstances would I consider no surgery or treatment. I also wouldn't cut corners on your health to go RV'ing. Your RV will be there when this is behind you...make sure you have a life to enjoy RV'ing. If you tackle cancer it can be beat, but if you ignore it will beat you. Hugs, Tina",

It is $42.00 for a small tube...will need several tubes to get thru chemo. I would love to know if anyone has actually tried it & if it works before spending $$$. I asked if it would work on my head & she said \"no\"...can't blame me for trying. Hugs, Tina",
