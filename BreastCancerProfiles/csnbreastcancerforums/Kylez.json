I think I was there about 40 minutes maybe. It actually was the hardest day as you do have to lay there still for so long. The other regular rad treatments only take a minute. It takes longer to undress than for the treatment. LOL I didn't have a mold of any kind. I just laid there with my arm in a comfortable sling on the side where my bc was. I got three tiny tattoos on the simulation day also. It doesn't hurt, felt like just a lil pinch. With the new rad machines, the radiation does not go anywhere except where it is suppose to go. Ask for them to explain it to you and to show you. My rads oncologist showed us the computer set up and everything. It is interesting and my hubby and I wanted to know all that we could. I also had boosters at the very end of my rad treatments, just to the tumor site. They want to make sure they kill any stray cancer cells left behind by surgery. Use your creams from day one, if your rads oncologist gives you some. And, use them for a few weeks after you are done. Be gentle with your skin also. And, wear socks and slacks as the room is usually freezing. Ask for a blanket to keep you warm. Good luck and I hope I helped you some.",

It is really greasy, but, does a great job on keeping your skin moist and you need that. I only used it at night with one of my husband's tshirts so I could just wash it in hot water and throw it away when rads were done as it stains. I got a prescription for Biafine, which is for any burn that you may get. I used it nightly too. I didn't burn, but, I got really dark pink and tender towards the end. My rads oncologist said that with the new machine at my cancer center, that no one burns, and, I didn't. I know some have on this board, but, I didn't. Be sure your rads oncologist checks your skin at least once a week or more. Don't dread it, just think of it as another tool in fighting the beast!",

And, if nothing works, please talk to your doctor about getting some help with anxiety drugs. I know there is no simple solution, but, you just don't want to let it take you over either. You have to take control of this and try to stop it. So, please call your doctor and make an appointment to talk with him. You don't have to go thru this anxiety on your own. There is help.
