Do I blame myself, No all I can do is try to take a good look at me and finally fill my world instead of others filling it for me. I had stage 3 HER triple negative and 11 out of 21 positive nodes and had to be very ill before anyone would even diagnostically check me. OH well that is all and yes treated with it all and just one big walking side effect now. 14 years later it doesn't get easier with new lumps I have had to deal with. Not so sure waiting and seeing with these ones sits well with me but spending all my energy on it I won't. Survival is truly what we make it and I am so grateful my life has been so much more than the hope the doctors gave me. A birthday is something that makes me realize how lucky I am and it is that simple now soon to be 50. My son and I are closer than we could have ever imagined and the possibility of grandchildren even there. Life doesn't seem to get any easier but the LOVE and LAUGHTER bigger than anything... Hang in there my friend and you too will be consumed by all that is good. Tara",

You know the drill wait a month and start the alert, bring it to doctors attention. Middle of Sep brought to my new doctor. Back to Cancer Clinic and pain specialist the only one who truly knows what I have been through. Not cancer, flaring up irritable bowl syndrom. Jan/02 still getting worse, more symptoms. Trip to specialist, IBS he still feels. Finally after not getting better they will agree not IBS, probably colitis. But you know we can't do anything till you have colonoscapy and biopsy the area. March/02 the appointment, but infact just for another conceltation. This didn't sit well with me so I phone cancer clinic and pain specialist there. If a chance it is cancer, I said, we can't be waiting. She got me into procedure for next tuesday. What a relief. The point to this post is to remind you to be your own advocate. We are the only ones who can ensure our health. Listen to your body, get things taken care of as they pop up don't deny the aches and pains we feel. Another day of drinking crap bowl movers and clear liquids. I have had just about enough of all this testing, maybe we will finally get to the bottom of this pain in my side. I will let you know what I find out should lknow by the end of the week or best case a couple of days. Just another day in the my LIFE, Tara24242",

Another fast growing lump that has gotten to 9 x 9 x 3 cm in just a month. Ultra sound inconclusive so heading back to cancer clinic so diagnosis will happen quicker than it did way back then. I am wondering if any Breast Cancer survivors out there who have a sarcoma on leg or arm of the same side they were treated for breast cancer and also if an acccident or fall might of stirred things up again. Life is an amazing journey and I am in for the ride. Life is just too short to spend our lives in worry and fear and wonder if I might have wanted to worry a little more than have all these years of survival. I can't help but think I have ignored signs and that is why I am here with this damn lump in my tricep and bicep. It pisses me off as always the way doctors still think they are tumor readers and can still say with certainty they believe it is a fat cyst without looking at it or touching it for that matter. Oh yes and the many questions about the depression and possibility of suicide because I have found another lump. My anxiety comes from doctors saying stupid things and not taking my past history serious enough. Not much has changed from the first go around I had. I have to say I couldn't come back to a better place than here during my time of uncertainty. Thanks Tara",

Actually after working in male oriented carrers it is refreshing to have men look me in the eye now that I am a flat liner. I have looked back on my life only to be reminded of how we should be careful what we wish for. I always hated having breasts because that always meant that I had to wear a shirt while my brother ran around half naked. I also use to pray to be the one to bear such pain as breast cancer only because I would only want to spare the people I love from what my grandmother had to go through. Hmmmmmmmmmmmm I might of thought of praying about something different like money that my friends seem to pray for. My chest is distorted since not doing reconstruction and I don't even notice or care more interested in sparing myself from more pain that is all... Great Posts Tara",

I was in pain and exhausted for sometime before I had these issues addressed. My GP could only see antidepressants as the cure all when in fact I knew my depression from pain and feeling sick all the time. I kept after them and keep after them if I can't work and am suffering. For the second time since cancer I have had to have issues addressed. Let me remind you all they do know the posibilities of side affects and don't talk about them till we seem to have them. They have been giving chem and radiation long enough now to know what really happens to our bodies after such a fight. Sometimes doctors need to be reminded of this. Good luck and don't let things go. One might want to look into to alternative therapies because there maybe something out there for you. Be good to yourself, Tara24242",

It has been 3 months now since I last worked and I have only gotten worse with time. I have reached the height of frustration as the doctors continued to push the irratable bowl thing even though I know deep inside, that isn't it. I have known for sometime that I am not well but all I hear is everyone assuring me it isn't cancer. When all I want to know is what it is and how to ease the pain. Well finally another visit, another 5 lbs down the drain and now bleeding from the bowl. Once again I have to get worse many times before I am taken seriously. I finally get the scope I should of had at the beginning. But oh now once again I fit no criteria just like the cancer. I feel like such a ***** to continue to moan about how ill I am and how much pain I am visit after visit. Now I have been heard. I probably have colitis but that won't even be confirmed and treatment started for another couple months. I am sitting here having a couple Tylinol finally for the pain and yes a drink to toast the onset of another disease, not that I don't have enough of them. Yes I am feeling a little sorry for me. But let this be a lesson to us all to continue to listen to the body and all it throws at us. If it lasts more than a month keep on them and if you get sicker make them hear you. thanks for listening, Tara 24242",

I have learned that it is easy in the natural health product to say things and not have to prove them. Governments are forced to spend millions trying to find out the truth to have some harm reduction over time. Not everything is good for us as we have found now that suppliments and vitamines have been around for 40 years. Man has thought allot of things about what the body does with the vitamines it takes in and after years of study have proved allot don't work and our bodies aren't doing what they thought all these years. Not every company has high natural standards either, in this day and age it is more about money/profit than it is about the human well being. Yes find something that helps you but don't take a false sense of security from any of it since there are no gaurantees and we must listen to the voice of our bodies and minimize our risk factors. Yes I do take a natural health product and have since doctors felt there was nothing more they could do for me and I was still suffering. I had to do something to try and free this body so that I could find out what it felt like to have alittle of that Quality of LIFE. I searched for something that had independent scientific studies on it and was being studied in an University for understanding of this fruits healing properties. I couldn't find another product that went that far. I am a real researcher before I do anything and that includes buying a car. I read and look in papers and go around many years and often am forced to buy something in the end because I haven't found what I was looking for. I am a Quality Control freak and have learned so much about the greed of man and how far they will go to turn a profit. Tara",

I want to be a voice out there for sites like these ones. I have been getting support and love from all of you this past year, that was very needed. The Question is: What positive effects have cancer web sites had on you while fighting or surviving cancer? I would be interested on anything you might share. In the time I have been here I have made some truly good friends I will cherish forever. You all have had on impact on how I am able to cope with this life of mine. In my province our Cancer Association has made it clear they think that often the information patients get is not accurate and may cause them to deny treatment based on poor or misinformation. I think we all can agree, at some point, we haven't had enough information leading us to search for more information on our own. We only want to be clear in our understanding. That is why I am here. I will always be grateful for you all and this site. Thanks always for sharing, Tara",

They want to know it is the chemo that is doing it when in fact we don't care what does it as long as it is working. Just a thought that drives me nuts knowing that cancer is one big study... Tara",

      "Content": "Maureen I tried accupuncture after chemo to quit smoking since I had tried many times before and not a heavy smoker. I had just been smoking off and on since I was a very young little girl. So that was it I lived through the chemo so now had to do something for myself to help myself so new smoking had to go. I was at a point that I felt it killing me with ever drag. So someone said I should do accupunk three little pokes in the ear. Well I had to go find the guy who had been doing it the longest and had to be an MD too, my choice. I found a man who had been practicing for 40 years at the time and had even worked for NASA in the 70's. HE had to be good. Well it was the worst experience in my life. I had been honest about my ordeals with cancer and found it to be a little like chineese torture. I am very sensative anyways but... I was infected at each needle wound. I quit smoking but swear it is due to pain association with the accupunture. It was nothing I had felt ever and I had already had a mastectomy that was very painful for me. I have allot of nerve involvement so not a good thing. Not everyone has this affect but I was looking for a nice calm little prick thing not needles and being hooked up to electrodes. I still say it was worth it since I gave up that terrible habit. I still see some good in the cancer ordeal too, as much as good there is bad is all. Be good to yourself, Tara",

      "Content": "As you must know by now I am 17 year survivor and the miracle of life is I am still here.  At Diagnosis my odds for survival were less than 40% and boy I thought my life was over especially being so sick.  I had never met a diagnosed cancer patient ever so ill as I so my hopes dropped drastically... I was 36 at the time with one of the most aggressive forms of Breast Cancer and looking back I had been sick most of my adult years but in too good fo shape for anyone to really care about me being tired and sore.  I found my own lump at 36 and then another grew quickly a golfball size in less than a week in my arm pit.  No one needed to diagnose me it was clear to me I just needed help... Side affects were many and about 4 years into survival I could no longer struggle through all the pain.  The doctors wanted me to finish at all costs every therapy along the way and deal with the fall out later hoping it too would go away.  I was left to GP and he was ill equiped to deal with new ways of dealing with medication.  At one time I was on 7 different medications because there were layers and layers of pain.  One was methadone and if there is one thing I have learned it does our bodies no good to suffer and soon wanting to put a gun to my head.  I was given every kind of antidepresant under the sun by my GP because Cancer survivors suffer anxiety instead of looking for actual reasons I was in pain. I finally after 5 years found an all natural product to replace the 7 medications after much reserching because I had been in manufacturing for more than 30 years.  I know there is nothing natural about most processes and that goes for processed natural foods and vitamins.  Money truly is the most important thing no matter.  I took Morinda Tahitian Noni and it can only be this kind for they independantly get tested to prove what they say is true and Hawaian Hospitals are studying this very product.  It cost the same as taking all the meds in a month and I soon found I had more energy and sleeping better feeling awake not dozie in the morning.  I stayed on it for 5 years but lost my job and couldn't afford it and haven't been able to take it since always out of work it seems.  Check it out it is the most amazing thing I have seen yet... I do not sell it or anything so good luck to you.  You must know that I mud and tape drywall something I apprenticed in since my cancer battle.  Movement is the only thing I have found that keeps one in shape and well.

      "Content": "I was watching the news and found it some what funny that people think a cluster of cancer can be 19 people on a huge block where there are many people with different forms of cancer. It struck me funny I guess because people have been dying from cancer and aids long before they actually knew what was their cause. Now there are often many cases of cancer on the same block and my mother in-laws block is no exception. People want to blame everything these days on building houses on landfills, when in fact that is basically what all our land in our cities are. Way back when there were often factories of one kind or another that were redeveloped to residential, or plain landfills because that is what man has done for centuries. I guess my problem with the plastics thing and landfill arguments is \"none of us get out of here alive.\" People are living long than they ever have even though cancer is prevelant. And for those who say they had no risk factors for their cancer I have to wonder. Did you never drink alchohol, smoke or eat bad foods that might of been the risk factor necessary to spern your cancer into growing. Once again I think there are variables too many to count in this world that MAN made. Men have ruled by greed and continue to move into countries that have no controls so they can run factories with little controls over them which only contaminates this country till people get sick and it starts to cost that country. Man doesn't really care about us and continues to behave badly, and what about the car pollution and emitions, what do you think that is doing to us yet people seem to want to drive bigger and continue to consume more gas...

How many women actually know what cancers they are at risk for next after one kind? My experience is that most women more intent on the cure than being their own advicates. If the doctor says they are cured and cancer free that is enough and the end for most. I have seen far too many women with bone cancer now because they had a false sense of security, I for one am not one of those. I had no chance for early detection due to short sightedness of specialist, thinking I was too young, too healthy and too well built for my lump to be cancerous. Now I take what they say with a grain of salt. I have had to watch my family believe the doctors are all knowing while our mother is suffering at the end of her life. Finally doctors listened and finally got the methadone needle form out instead of all the pills she was trying to keep down. Inform yourselves and you be able to help yourself more than you would ever think. Jean I understand your anger but that will only eat you alive not helping you keep your energy for your fight at hand. You are close at heart and in my thoughts.

My dear friend was diagnosed 14 years after me and that is hard to take though she was fortunate to have been diagnosed at 0 to stage 1 but treatments still the same. I hope there is one thing that leaving our posts and feelings down can do and that is be the honesty necessary in a world where the medical community still does not want to scare us and often don't understand the physical pain that can be the direct result of treating the disease. I came here to get answers that I was not getting and found some along the way. I encourage women to go to sites when I hear of diagnosis and read womens stories out there because that has been the best help yet. This is a family and we are here for those who are alone, feel alone or just don't feel like they can make it another step on their own. Being understood makes all the difference in the this world and here is a community that truly understands. Tara",

I really understand your feelings of being sick and tired of being sick and tired. I think this is a goal many of us are still striving for. Your body is on its own healing time and one must try and give it the time it needs to heal and get through all it has been through. Our minds want this to be over and done but sometimes our bodies aren't in line with our minds. WE have to allow for the healing and give in to the time needed. We are always in such a rush to return to our lives as we now know it yet still ignore the bodies cry for rest and healing. I hope you will take the time your body needs to get on with the life you have left to live. It is hard to imagine the cure is sometimes worse than the very disease, but in some cases this is very true. I hope that you will find wellness on your journey. I think sometimes we have to struggle long and hard for the quality to our lives we so diserve. Be good to yourself, Tara",

We often feel like we are neglecting our families, yet we don't feel like doing it more energy to expell. We feel like cancer is wasting so much of our lives, wishing for it to end, sparing us from the side affects that some must go through as well. Learning to take care of ourselves is the most that we should get out of our experience. I am sorry you feel the way you do, my hope is that you too will emerse yourself in getting better and doing what you can to change the coarse of all you must endure. and hope that you can give the body the rest it needs to repare all the damage that has been done by the cancer, let alone the damage encured from the treatments. I know one thing for sure and that is I wouldn't be here without the efforts and measures taken, I now live in gratitude and hope that I can give back to others that must endure and so much worse than anything I have had to face. I have found purpose finally in my life something I knew nothing about before having to face all I have. I have found that there are things I have control over and those I do not and I choose to spend my energy on the ones I have control over. I have learned to let things go and not get stuck on some stupid thing way out there in left field. I think the thing I have learned is we can never go back and will never be exactly the same but that doesn't mean it can't be better than it was, if different. I have had to let the old me go cause it wasn't working and few new ways to live my life and take care of my being. I now consentrate on things I want to do and have learned to say NO and keep the energy for myself where it should of been forcused on. I have learned that I have more to give to others even though I do find myself saying no sometimes. I have purpose in my life something I hadn't even thought of before. I also live with some intention with the things I find myself doing rather than just going through motions just getting things done. I now do nothing if I seriously don't have the energy to do it anymore. The days are long gone that I can't stop and listen to all my body is saying. We listen to others more than ourselves sometime so feel it and hear what it says. Be good to yourself always, 24242",

      "Content": "Hello ladies, I don't spend much time on the details of my cancer, enough to know that it was grade three with positive nodes and negative to hormone. I think we sometimes waste valuable energy on things that we can't control like the details of our disease. I am still having a rocky existance with nausea and no hunger pains, hence still force feeding. I think that is what takes so much energy having to be so conscious of eating something if it has been along time. My pain is still very much controlled the best part of my recovery I just wish other things would fall into place and stablize. One truly does get sick and tired of being sick and tired. I am still having to force the workouts and getting more active. Leading the sedantary life was very hard on my body and now hard work getting it back into some sort of shape. I am just so fortunate that my company is so understanding and hopefully with all the layoffs that have been having I will manage to have a job when I am ready to return. I told an old aunt recently that I was beginning to think surviving and living in the world is just plane and simply very HARD work. It is and I am up for the challenge how about you? I am going to be in such good shape that I will be able to kick the crap out of anyone and maybe last through an 8 hour or even 12 hour work day once again. I have been learning to make my life just as important as the feeling I have towards working and I agree that was definately lacking all these years. We are the priority or we won't have our help to return to our jobs that we love. I am getting ready for two weeks holidays and just wanted to let you all know that I will be gone for a couple weeks. I am looking forward to going home and seeing my family since it is my mother's 70th Birthday. I will surprise her with my attending the party, I told them I wouldn't be able to make it. I hope that will be a good present for her. Now you all have a good summer and truly take care of your beings. I really hope that you all find your health again just as I am doing. Seems it is in there somewhere just have to tap into it. See you all soon and hope to catch some of you in chat on my return. Be good our there, Tara24242",

My understanding there was no further treatments for us only Chemo and radiation and surgery because of the negative factor. Enlighten me please... Tara",

      "Content": "You will be so happy to read a positive note from me, since the past not so. As some of the newbies might not know I have been off work since October with a new round of chronic pain resulting in chronic fatigue. This is the second time since by Fight For Life that I have battle this. The first was after all the treatments were done and Tara just wasn't getting any better. But issues were addressed and the pain finally controlled with the help of medication and some alternative product, I managed to work and cope with all I was given. Thankful for duty to accomodate legislation here or I too would have problems returning to work since I can't do what I was hired to do. No More Physical, heavy jobs for me after all these years in manufactoring. I had only worked 6 months at new job before being dx'd with cancer. After my return from cancer I worked most of the 2.5 years in more of a Lab situation. Then the company reorganized and being the junior person they had to find other work for me so had me try some other jobs on the floor. I voiced my concerns as I always have since this disease, but I too didn't know what I was capable of so I agreed that I didn't know cause I hadn't tried. They said give it a shot and I voiiced my concers about my chest and all my other problems but agreed to try it. I was excited I could the job but soon found fatigue in the muscles waas a definite problem. No matter how good of shape I was in the fatigue factor I hadn't counted on to last forever. Even taking longer breaks didn't help so when fatigue set in that was when potential for injury very high. One thing that I didn't count on was after double mastectomy that my muscles weren't the same either. Two times I was hurt trying new jobs and it was soon after the pain set in. I had stomach problems getting worse and pain in left side that just would not go away. More often than not I was in fetal position trying to get through it. You know what they say, keep eye on it if it doesn't go away in a couple weeks to a month go get it checked. Well in that time I found myself, once again, so ill I couldn't cope, something I knew all to well with cancer. I had been bringing things up with my doctor but she was new and really knew nothing about what I went through with my cancer let alone survival of it. Should see my file it is ridiculous. Well ladies I am happy to REPORT, Pain is Subsiding finally, Eating disorder straightening out finally eating better and bowl and stomach, much much better. Now just a matter of getting energy level back up and with that a little more strength. Once again I am almost through to my light. I was finally put on a medication to try and address the pain issues and by George I think we have it. You won't believe me when I tell what I am taking. I must of been a heroin addict in one of my past lifes cause it sure wasn't in this one. I have been taking methadone, the one and the same used for treating heroin addiction. Not the first drug I have been on that has been used for another disorder. I couldn't believe it myself when she suggested it but what did I care if it worked. She has used it before in some cases it can work, in mine it seems to be. YIPPIE I am almost ready to celebrate. As a matter fact that isn't true I celebrate everyday, being here in the here and now. I finally am going to see more of the good of what life has to hold than the negative that has been holding me down. Now it is time to get myself healthy again and return to the life I made for myself after my initial battle with cancer. Who knew that life after would be full of so many challenges. Thanks for being my rock ladies, when I was down you were here for me. Don't know what I would of done this time had I not reached out and finally got internet and found the support of friends I have needed. Who would of thought. Be GOOD to yourselves, Love ya, Tara",
