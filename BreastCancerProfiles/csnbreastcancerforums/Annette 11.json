She said to remove the inserts every night and put them back into the forms to keep their shape nicely. Taking them out of the bra pockets every night is a real pain. Can't i just lay the bra down? What do all of you ladies do? I don't want to damage them. They look real good, fuller than I was. Thanks, Annette",

Chemo is not fun but doable, before you know it you will be done with that part of your treatment. You have made your decision so that is half the battle. It will be ok. we are here for you when ever it gets tough or you want a sister to talk to. Good luck and please keep us posted as to what your onc. tells you tomorrow. Hugs Annette",

Had many scans and biopsies. Waiting by the phone for all the results to come in was so draining. Prayer put me at peace and my husband and I got through. Finally I had the mastectomies. Don't be afraid, you'll get through this and be ready for the next step of your journey. I kept a journal with dividers so I had everything orgainized. I look refer back to it alot. August will be one year since surgery and sept. I started chemo and it all went fast. We are here for you at all times. Please keep us posted. Hugs, Annette",

I try to fight it and most of the time I do. For me I think I'll feel better in the fall. The summer heat zaps my energy and keeps me indoors. Of course, it's the OMG what if..... I hope you will do better after your last radiation. Hugs. Annette",

      "Content": "I searched and read alot about taking supplements or vit. during chemo from very reputable doctors and I deceided against it. They can interfere with your chemo and your blood counts. I have always eaten well and healthy so I just continue that practice. My appetite has not been effected during the two chemo's I have had so far. I have 2 more chemo's remaining. I also bought the book Chemo therepy for dummies at the book store and they don't endorse supplements either. Chemo nurse took blood before therapy this past week and wbc, rbc and platlets actually went up, so that is very good. I believe having homemade lentil soup everyday, cream of wheat farina for breakfast everyday and steak once a week and fish and chicken (all high in iron) and of course veggies, fruit, nuts, yogart has helped. I'm sure others may be doing well on supplements. I would also like to hear if others are taking suppliments and what brand? I pondered over this decision also for awhile before starting treatment. Please check msnbc. I think the video from a doctor on there was convincing to me. Good Luck to your sister. Annette",
