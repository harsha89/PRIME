      "Content": "I tried Effexor but was not happy about the sexual side effects.  It was very difficult to get off of it, so I won't be doing that again.  My oncologist came up with clonidine patches.  Clonidine is a blood pressure medication that isn't very effective in pill form but is very effective in the patch.  I started on the smallest dose and am now up to the highest dose.  It has helped a lot with the hotflashes, and my blood pressure is great.  The longer I have been on Arimidex the worse they seem to get.  Now I'm using the patch and getting acupuncture twice a week and a Chinese herbal preparation called Zhi Bai di Huang Wan from Seven Forest.  The Zhi Bai was prescribed by my naturopath who is very knowledgeable about oncology.  I take six before bed time.  It seems to take all three for me to control the hot flashes, but I often don't wake at all at night.  When I do, I go back to sleep.  I will have a few mild ones during the day.  This is a huge improvement.  Before I was waking up three and four times a night and unable to sleep after 3 or 4 AM, and I was miserable during the day.  The acupuncture and some other herbs also help with general dryness.  My eyes are no longer painful, and the vaginal dryness has improved.  I'm a happy camper. ",
