      "Content": "Wow... so I have to have a core biopsy on Friday. I went in for my routine mammogram and ultrasound. I told them about a new lump (there have been numerou-- for about as long as I've had breasts). That's the only reason I got the ultrasound. The mammogram looked garbled as always from all the density and cysts, but the ultrasound picked up a \"solid mass\", they called it. It never fails..every year, with the exception of this one, the radiologist has said I didn't need one, as the mammogram doesn't look any different from the year before. Glad I said there was a change, or they might not have done one this time, and picked this up. It is right under an old biopsy scar from when I was 23 years old. I am 46 years old, and I have had my eyes open for the last ten years, going for those mammos, and trying...TRYING..each year to get the ultrasound to go with it. Never again will I take NO for an answer. Thanks for letting me rant.",
