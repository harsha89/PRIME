      "Content": "Hi ladies! It has been a month since my surgery and things have not been fun lately. I guess I didn't realize how serious of a surgery this was, but I have been having a rough go. I am finally down to one crutch, but I am still unable to get dressed by myself, put my shoes on, etc. Pretty much anything that requires bending over is a no. I am still taking microbiology and calc though. I was probably in over my head thinking I could take classes, but I'm stubborn so theres no going back now. I really struggle with letting people take care of me because I always want to do things for myself, so as you can imagine things have been hard. I started Physical Therapy and I am getting a lot better, but it truly is a test of patience. I had to have another surgery on Monday because my wound was still draining and they were worried there was an infection developing. On top of everything I have been dealing with, my passive aggressive roommate finally hit her breaking point on Monday. She screamed at me for 45 minutes and pretty much told me I was a burden. She said that she resents me for putting her in this position and that it is not her job to take care of me. According to her, I also don't realize how me being sick affects other people, which I thought was pretty funny that she was complaining when I never complain and I'm the one ACTUALLY going through it. She sat there and told me that I should be home, I shouldn't be taking classes, and I should have my mom take care of me. I told her that I wasn't going to sit there and listen to her tell me how to live my life and left. Needless to say, I have been staying at my sorority house and avoiding her at all costs. The reality of the situation is, I have a 40% cure rate. If heaven forbid something does happen, I'm not going to just sit on the couch and be sick. I am going to live my life. I don't know if anyone has had an experience like this with a \"friend\" who ended up being ridiculously selfish, but I refuse to allow people like that in my life. My dad is doing much better. He's pretty incredible. He works almost 12 hour days every day at the hospital even with a gimp arm. He almost had to have a shoulder replacement, so his recovery is pretty intensive as well. One good aspect of all of the craziness is that I have started dating the most incredible guy. He's so handsome, caring, and selfless and has been such an unexpected blessing. My medical oncologist tried to convince me to do chemo when I saw him last week. The problem is, it didn't work the first time and it completely compromised my quality of life so there's pretty much no convincing me. They are researching an alternative drug treatment plan that I would potentially be on for the next 2-5 years, but we will know more when I have another pet scan at the end of the month to see if more disease is present. Wish this update came with better news, but I am hopeful that things will start looking up very soon. Sorry I don't post often, but I think and pray for you girls always. Hope you all had an incredible Valentines Day with your loved ones. Kat",

      "Content": "I know this feeling all too well. Its awful. I had a mastectomy, went through months of chemo, gained 15 pounds from steroids, went through rads multiple times and none of it worked. The worst is looking in the mirror and not recognizing yourself. I was 19 when I was diagnosed and I felt so ugly and self conscious and insecure. I hate that you are having to go through this. I know you are just venting and I suggest that you vent away. That is what we are here for. If I could give you any bit of advice, it would be to take your time line you have in your mind for getting your breasts reconstructed, or starting radiation, or going into remission, whatever it may be- throw it out the window. That was the hardest thing for me, was getting my hopes up that something would happen by a certain date and just continuing to be disappointed. I'm 21 and its been two years since I was diagnosed and I'm still in limbo. It totally sucks and I know what you mean about not knowing God's plan, but I promise you, if you just have hope and faith throughout this shitty journey, you're going to get better and sooner or later you will realize His plan. It took me hitting rock bottom (i.e. my disease becoming terminal) to finally be at peace with everything. I wish I could take all of your anger and frustration and sadness away from you, but just never give up. You have made it this far, and I know you can make it through. Praying so hard for you! Hang in there! Kat",

      "Content": "Hi girls! I'm having such an incredible trip, have met such incredible people, and have visited some pretty incredible places.. but for some reason I am having a hard time clearing my head. For starters, I know my Xeloda is not working. I don't need my doctor to tell me its not working. The evergrowing tumors sticking out of my leg pretty much speak for themselves and serve as a constant reminder that I'm not getting better. The stares aren't fun to deal with either. I know that being one of two people on this cruise under 40 years old makes me stick out like a sore thumb, but its awkward having dozens of geriatrics staring at my bulging scar as I limp around the ship. Don't get me wrong, I feel like this vacation was exactly what I needed and it is honestly a trip of a lifetime, but sometimes it feels like a constant reminder of what I will miss out on in my lifetime. I wish I could pack up my things and work on a cruise ship for a year so I can travel the world and meet tons of fascinating people, but I know that most likely won't happen. This little bit of freedom/escape from real life is such a tease! Part of me wants to never come home so I don't have to deal with more surgery/treatment/bad news. As much fun as it is to go to the doctor every day, I really wish I could continue to explore and enjoy these beautiful countries. Its weird because I'm very calm about my situation, but I wish I had more time to play so I could deal with all of the serious stuff later. I think the fact that I'm having such an amazing vacation makes it worse because I don't want to come back to real life. I am so hard on myself when I get in these bummed out moods because I feel like I'm being ungrateful for the blessings in my life. I guess I just have to accept that sometimes its okay to be sad and/or disappointed. I still have 2 weeks left, so I'm going to make the most of it! Just wanted to share a little with you ladies because I feel like out of everyone you can understand these rollercoaster emotions. Hope y'all have a wonderful weekend!! Kat",
