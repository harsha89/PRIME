    "Content": "Sue: Good luck with your surgery. I will be thinking about you tomorrow. Reconstruction is a personal decision and we have to make it for ourselves. I know you will make the right decision for you. While mentally preparing myself for surgery, I could not face having to go back in for more surgery (reconstruction). The surgeon did assure me that I could come back in at anytime and have reconstruction done. Just take care of yourself. Peggy",
