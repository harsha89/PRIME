    "Content": "Has anyone had nipple attachment and them not look the same? I have one that is flush with my skin and the other one protrudes a bit and looks real good. My plastic surgeon does not want to try to do it for the 3rd time in fear that it won't work. Any suggestions??? He took skin from my side around the hip bone. Any help would be appreciated.",
