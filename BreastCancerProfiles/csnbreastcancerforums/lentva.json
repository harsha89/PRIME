    "Content": "I had my first Cytoxan/Taxotere treatment on Monday. I had some nausea, and body aches from the Neulasta shot. The nausea meds work, but I found I had to stay on top of it, taking the meds before the nausea sets in. No excessive tiredness yet. I took a Percocet I had left over from surgery on Wednesday night when the body aches (mostly neck area) were at its worst. It got me through the night and I felt better the next morning. Let me know how you're doing. Take care.",
