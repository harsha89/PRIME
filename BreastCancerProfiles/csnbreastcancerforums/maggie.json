Chemo does effect everyone different,but they have so many nausea drugs now that really works. I usually would get sick on my 3rd day after chemo. I hope that everything turns out fine for you, I will remember you in my prayers. Take care and stay in touch , Maggie",

      "Content": "Hello All, I need some information please. I have a friend that was DX with breast cancer, stage 2 aggressive.She had a lumpectomy She finished treatment with chemo and radiation. She is doing very well, just a bit tired at times. Otherwise she is very active. My question to all?? After you had surgery, chemo, and possibly radiation, Did your oncologist follow up with tests to see if there was any cancer activity in the original site, and possibly other sites of the body. Such as colonscopy, especially a Pet Scan to see for active cancer cells??? Is there any other tests she should have???? Let me say, I am a cancer survivor, DX in Sept 2009, remission Jan 2011. Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Let the angels and my prayers guide you on a path to recovery. Thank you for any information you can give me. Maggie",

Without the help of my family and my loving husband and my best friend, I don't know if I could have made it. My mother missed alot of work to stay home with me and help take care of the baby and myself. I pray for the women who undergo this treatment and has no family to help them. Maybe their church or a local childcare could help out these womens. maggie",

      "Content": "Hi Ladies! I'm Maggie. I haven't posted in a long time to this site. I was diagnosed with very aggresive breast cancer in August 1999.Finished all my treatment , now taking Tamoxifen. I went to my gyn. for my yearly pap smear a couple of weeks ago and he also did a ultrasound of my ovaries and uterus. He found a cyst on my left ovary and then he did a CA125 ovarian cancer screening test. A week later my results was in and my levels was 142.7, which is very high. He wanted to do a hystertomy on me, which we did last week. THey found NOTHING! He , along with my onologist thought that they would find something. In 4 weeks , they will do another CA125 test on me to re-check my levels. If still high, who knows what then? My onologist will have to order alot of other testing. Has anyone ever experience this or have heard of this happening. I told my doctor that I beleived that there was cancer in there, but God was watching over me and he took it out. Maggie",
