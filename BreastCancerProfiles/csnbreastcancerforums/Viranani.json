I'm Buddhist, not Catholic, but don't really think the difference matters so much as far as this is concerned...we share similar priorities. I've got bi-lateral mastectomy coming up, and body image doesn't feel so important as it clearly is for most people. When I got the news, I thought more about challenge, knowing that this'll be a huge learning experience, and a deepening of my spiritual life! Which doesn't seem like a bad thing at all...already it's cracked the heart wide open, no small gift!",
