    "Content": "Hello. My mom just found out she has infiltrating ductal carcinoma, Nottinghmam score 5 (grade 1). The treatment suggested is lumpectomy, removal of lymph node(s), possibly radiation. I have a zillion questions. First, does anyone know about doctors in the Myrtle Beach, SC area? Surgical oncologists? Or who NOT to use? I have bought the Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book, and am studying away, but some personal experience would be welcomed.",
