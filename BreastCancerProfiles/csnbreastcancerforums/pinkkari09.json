It's unfortunate that we didn't get to meet your Lesley, but a blessing we got to see your love for her. All of your posts (even the sad ones) give me an idea of what it's like to have true love. God will lift her to the heavens and there she will wait the day you all can join her. One day your family will be together again. When I lost my Mom almost three years ago I discovered that now she is with me ALL the time, not just when we are physically together. Maybe you can let the kids know that Mommy will be healthy, pain free, and at their side ALL the time, looking over her beautiful family. Please take care of yourself, it's very important you get the support you need, you have been through so much and more to come. I pray the Lord gives you strength to endure this trying time and the support you need to help you through, may He watch over Lesley, You, and your children at all times and keep all of you at peace. Amen Big Big Hugs, Kari",

It was ok for the most part, I really enjoyed not losing my hair, you won't with Xeloda. The worst side effects I experienced were occasional diarrhea, hand/foot syndrome, and ringing in my ears. The hand foot syndrome can get really severe so watch close for that, and take good care of your paws, I kept them out of hot water as much as possible. The ringing in my ears drove me crazy when I was trying to get to sleep, but sleeping pills took care of that temporarily. I hope everything goes well for you and I hope this helps some. Also, this medication is VERY expensive, my insurance covered well, but some companies aren't so good with it. They do have a prescription co-pay assistance card as well that picks up 80% of your co-pay. My Xeloda ran $4500.00 a month, and I only had to pay $120.00 I'm not fully awake right now so I know I'm forgetting things but if I think of them, I'll add to your post. Keep the Faith, Kari",

I took Emend, one pill before chemo began and one pill each day for two days after, it wiped out the nausea, it was an amazing drug. It is very expensive but my insurance covered 400.00 and I paid 75.00, yep for three pills. And for the neulasta shot, my bones hurt terribly, I took hydrocodone, prescription pain med, it was a life saver for the pain I endured, that shot wreaked havoc with my body. Please let your oncologist know what you are going through and don't suffer any more than you need too, there's plenty of good meds out there to help you get through this.

He may be acting out because he just don't know how to handle it. My (now ex husband) and I got divorced through my battle, he was so lost and frustrated because he couldn't fix it and he just went crazy on me. Now we are great friends and he is here for me any time I need him, were divorced, live separate, and get along great, it's weird, this cancer thing. I do agree with what others have said, if he's alcoholic, al-anon will help you tremendously. Sending prayers up for you, you have been through so much!! Hugs, Kari",
