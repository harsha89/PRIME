    "Content": "I was diagnosed with stage III invasive ductal carcinoma in April '07 (I'm 44 years old). I began chemo two weeks later - 4 A/C and 12 Taxol and Herceptin (I still have 4 more to go). Surgery is scheduled for October. I'm planning on having a bilateral mastectomy with (maybe) reconstruction - I'm still on the fence about that. My surgeon wants to do a sentinal node biopsy - since chemo will be done he just wants to take a few lymph nodes. My oncologist, however, wants to take alot of lymph nodes out. If I've already had chemo, what difference does it make whether to take a few lymph nodes or a lot? And for that matter, if they find that cancer had once been in the lymph nodes, what does that mean for further treatment? I'll be picking up with the Herceptin again after surgery for I don't know how long.",
