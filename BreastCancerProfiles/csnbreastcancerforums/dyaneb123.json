There is help out there, so it's hard to imagine just sitting and waiting for weeks just for the initial diagnosis. But you have your reasons, and it's your life, your body.

It is a very exclusive club that you have unfortunately become a member of. But so have all of us on the board. And we are here to help each other through every step of the way. Chemo is the scariest part of the whole trauma for a lot of us. It certainly was for me. To let them shoot poisons into your veins, not knowing what the effect will be on your body, is a crazy thing to have to do. But they are so good at controlling the side effects now that most of us experience very little nausea. I'll have my 4th treatment next week, and I just feel lethagic for a few days. Good luck and let us know how it goes. Dee",

I had a continual mild nausea, but nothing that would keep me from driving. One side effect can be diarea, so that might make your bus route difficult.I had days where I had to pull into 4 or 5 fast food joints trying to get home.",

As we've progressed through the semester they have begun to ask more questions about treatments which I dont mind answering. As someone else mentioned, many of them have personal family experience with cancer and it gives them a chance to talk about it and relate their experiences. I never really addressed the wig issue as I started the year with it and it wasn't that different then my normal hair. In a couple more months when I have enough hair back to go wigless, that may be a shock! I think because most of us dont \"look\" sick, that it's easy for them to forget that we are battling cancer on a day to day basis.",

Ok maybe the \"wonderful\" care you recieved, the new appreciation for life, the compassion of friends and family are blessings.....but cancer???
