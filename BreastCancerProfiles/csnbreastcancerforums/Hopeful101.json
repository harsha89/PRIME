      "Content": "Lumpectomy/partial mastectomy surgery was on left breast May 2017. I am on round # 4 out of 21 sessions of radiation on the left breast. My treatment also involves holding my breath when the machine is on. I was told that this targeted radiation will not reach my heart. I was wondering if you have any other information to share as my emotions tend to be all over the place although I am much better. Wondering about Teach76 and you too Sparkle 1 Also, wonder why I seem to have a dull feeling, not a headache, just a heavy feeling. Also, what kind of nutrition did they advise while on radiation? Thanks.  ",
