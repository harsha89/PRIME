It was the mailman delivering a package filled with cards and gifts from the ladies on this site. Thank you so much, that was so much fun opening the cards and packages, i also plan on writing each of you personally. The blanket is beautiful and will be useful with the snow tonight, and the jewlrey, picture, the key chain, necklaces, writing paper and trinkets and good luck pieces that each of you picked out for me. And thank you to our wonderful Aysemari who got all this together and sent it to me(i will admit i gave her a hard time about giving her my address). I love each gift and card that you sent to me, hmmm, i am wondering how you planned all this! You are so wonderul to do this, I know that now i will have to really fight this. Thank you all, you will never know how much this means to me",

The wig will fit better after you lose your hair, which I will warn you is very sad. But it will grow back very nicely. I also lost my eyebrows and eye lashes, just wanted to warn you that might happen. I lost mine in the summer, so I bought a really nice pair of Coach sunglasses and wore them alot. It is important to wear sunglasses since your eyelashes act as a shield for yours eyes. And who cares if it is a cloudy day! My lashes grew back thin, so I do need to wear mascara. Take care",

I did get a copy of the cat scan and it did show a slight decrease in the tumor in my liver which was originally 9x8 cm, yikes, it is huge. Also, there was a decrease in most of the swollen lymph nodes in my stomach area, however, there was a slight increase in one of the lymph nodes. Also, there was some activity in my bone mets. Soooo, i am going for a second opinion on Aug 24 at Fox Chase Cancer Center, with Dr Massimo Cristofanilli who is a specialist with Inflammatory breast cancer and has come to Philadelphia from MD Anderson in Houston. Spent 2 days on the phone setting this up, i am now trying to get all my records together. Pain is getting better, so that is a plus. I have been very tired and found out that I am anemic and my blood count was low, they did an iron panel to check that out. Still trying to set up an appointment for the Lymphedema issue, since there are not too many lymphedema specialists. And also, it seems like everyone is on vacation!!!! I am on disability from work, my doctor has me out for 6 months, which has been approved. I have been reading everyones posts, and it looks like everyone is doing well. I am a little concerned about switching doctors at this point, i saw a post about this. Take care...",

At Thanksgiving she became ill and was told that further treatment was useless. She overcame so much pain, both in her personal life and with her fight with cancer. She leaves behind 3 children, 2 of whom are very young. And oh yes, lets not forget the cheating ex husband. As you all may know, I am struggling through a reoccurance.

In my case, I had been complaining that I was not feeling well but my breast surgeon and oncologist kind of blew me off. So, I would suggest that you know your body and insist on additional testing or get a second opinion. That being said, I am so happy that you are NED.

I was constipated, so I had to take a stool softener, your oncology nurse will recommend something. I also had anti-nausea drugs. My nurses were so helpful, I really believe you will be fine. I was tired, but I would rest alot. I also talked on the phone to friends and family, You will also meet people at chemo who are going through the same thing, talk to them. Think positive!",
