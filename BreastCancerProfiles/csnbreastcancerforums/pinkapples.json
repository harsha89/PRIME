      "Content": "There's not enough to already deal with! Bummer :( I had the same issue at first and was told the same thing. (I was a DD) However, my surgeon refused to accept the insurance answer and found a way around it by saying she would reduce my remaining breast for \"health reasons\". A couple surprises changed everything quickly and I had a bi-lat mastectomy so this ended up being all in vain! But... There are ways around it. Work with your Dr, or nurse, or patient advocate, your insurance rep, somewhere you will find someone creative enough with thier wording to get you the peace of mind you deserve> Heck, You have earned it! Stay stong sister and dont take no for an answer :)",
