    "Content": "I was diagnosed with colon cancer last april, just caught my attention. My story is my wife decided to rekindle an old relationship from when she was 18, she is now 47. Married for 27 years and she decides to find a boyfriend during my 6 months of chemotherapy. She left a month ago, and told me and my 2 older sons she was sorry and we wouldn't understand. So when I saw SEX my thoughts were I would at this point I would be happy with friendship. I don't mean to infringe on another site, but I bet I have some woman fighting mad right now, how someone could be so heartless. Not sure why I decided to chime in on this comment, but i'm a retail manager and there are several OTC lubricants, KY jelly is our number 1 seller. I just needed a break from the colon cancer site chuck",
