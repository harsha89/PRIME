    "Content": "Hi! I finished chemo in March and radiation in May. Went to the doc today and he gave me the choice of regular follow-ups, with just a physical, yearly mammogram and pelvic (I'm on tamoxifen) or all that plus lab tests. He gave me an article from the New England journal of medicine (October 2000) that indicates that blood marker tests, etc. don't make any difference in early detection or survival rates. Any info. out there to help me decide?",
