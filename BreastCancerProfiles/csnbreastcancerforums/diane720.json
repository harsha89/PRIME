      "Content": "Hi Christine, First of all its very normal to be freaking out. In about 6 weeks or so I will have a mastectomy once I finish chemo. At first it seemed so far away, but now that its getting closer, its on my mind constantly. I chose to have a bilateral,although my surgeon feels I don't need to. At an appointment I had this past friday,she asked how I was feeling about my mastectomy. I told her I wasn't afraid of the surgery, I'm afraid to wake up and see that part of me missing. I've been struggling with myself, but in order to survive and go on I know I can do this,you can do this!! Do not underestimate your strength. You will find it the day of your mastectomy. I'm sending you alot of light and love. Many blessings .....Diane",

I came to discover that one of the ant-nausea meds I recieved during treatment was causing my monster headaches. My doctor switched meds and no more headaches. You might want to look into your anti-nausea meds.",
