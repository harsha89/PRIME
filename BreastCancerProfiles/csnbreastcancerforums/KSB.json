      "Content": "Hi - I'm scheduled for TRAM Flap surgery in February. I'm SCARED TOO DEATH! I've heard good and bad. I don't know what to do. I'm almost ready to cancel the surgery because the fear is getting the best of me....BUT living with the alternative (prosthesis) SUCKS! I feel so unattractive I can hardly stand to look at myself anymore. I was diagnosed in May of 2006, endured chemo, mastectomy (left side) and radiation. My plastic surgeon is supposedly one of best in the city - that does give me some comfort. Please tell me what to do. Thanks",
