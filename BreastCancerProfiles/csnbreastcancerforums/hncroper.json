    "Content": "I had a lumpectomy and it was general anesthesia. I freak out with needles and get very anxious so the port that they installed was suppose to be local \"loopy\" but I cried like a 2 year old and hyperventilated a lot. Talk to your doctor and you should be able to do general. The biopsy was a little bad not too much, you do feel pulling and tugging though no pain. I have stage 3 breast cancer and had 23 of 25 lymph nodes removed because they were cancerous so it has been hard, but it can be done.",
