      "Content": "Ok, so I go to my radiation oncolgist check up appointment and she does a breast exam and says that she feels cysts on one of my breasts. She said that she isn't overly concerned, but to ask them about it on my next mamogram......To my knowledge I have never had cysts before. I am presuming that, because she didn't send me immediately to have a mamogram, that it must not be anything to worry about, but I sure wish she hadn't found anything at all..... Has anyone been told that they had cysts and found out that it was actually a recurrence??? I am guessing cysts are not solid so if that is what it is, it means it isn't cancerous. I guess I need to do a little reasearch about cysts before I get all worried... Of course sometimes ignorance is blyss.....",

The first time they gave it to me, the nurse stood by with the benedryl in case it happened and it did. She piggypacked the benedryl in with my chemo and it stopped. I never had it happen when I was having radiation though... Did they check your BP or any vitals when it happened??",
