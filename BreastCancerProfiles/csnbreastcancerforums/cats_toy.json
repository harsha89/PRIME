Farrah is someone who has been in our lives through television etc for many many years, so it seems as if it is someone you know and are close to. It does make it harder, and I'm sure it affects everyone harder than they think it will. Do not give up. If you are depressed, talking it out helps, we are all here for you. If we can't help, go to a professional. Please don't let it get so far that it affects your health. We all care about you too much, and it would hurt all of us too. Be well and happy. Cat",

He never asked how I was doing, just ran off a list of things I should and should not avoid foodwise so as not to \"catch\" it again. I then told him I always ate healthy, we do not eat fast food, we always buy fresh organic vegetables with no bug spray, farm fresh eggs, etc. and guess what? I got cancer!!! gee, what do I do now? He couldn't really say anything then but \"oh\". Can't let them drag us down.

You all lift my spirits whenever I visit here, and if you need to vent, you know we are here for you. I think my melancholy lately has been because it was President's Day weekend three years ago that I got my diagnosis. The actual date is Feb 19, but it was that holiday weekend that I hung around after having the needle biopsy, waiting for the news. But today is a better day (can smile for real, not just show teeth!), the infection seems to be letting go, and it is a beautiful warm sunny day. Maybe all I needed was the gift of all of you here. Smile like you mean it! Cat",

I have shelves of them, even if they don't stay on long. I get to work at kick them under my desk, and there they stay til I leave again. My boss would occasionally hide them from me so I had to go on a scavenger hunt through the office to find them. You really need to buy more and soon.

I never was good at crying, my eyes swelled up and looked like tomatoes (not a pretty sign). When I lost my dad, I would not cry, so on the way home from work, which seemed to be the time it hit me worst, I would scream. Feels good too! You do what you need to keep sane.

Very, very low. and I would want to know if my D's (not my boobs... anymore) had soy, so thank you for the info. =^..^=",

Good luck with either choice you make, it will always be the right one for you. When do you start your chemo? Cat",
