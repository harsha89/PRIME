      "Content": "You're right, the surgeon and the oncologist should be on the same page as far as your treatment is concerned. I remember when I first met with my surgeon, she gave me the option of having some chemo before I had my mastectomy. My tumor was 2 1/2 cm. She said it might shrink it down a little, but I just wanted the beast out of me. So that's what we did, and I'm very thankful, because the cancer had already spread to 2 of the centinel nodes, but no further. I had 8 rounds of chemo followed by 30 radiation treatments. Now I'm waiting for reconstructive surgery in December. I think you should sit down with both you surgeon and oncologist at the same time and come to a decision, and you need to put in your two cents, because it's your body. Connie",

      "Content": "The veterans on this websight have all given you some very good advice and information. They always do. I was diagnosed with breast cancer on December 2, 2008. I had my mastectomy on December 23, 2008. I went home on Christmas Eve with two tubes still attached. Thank goodness my oldest daughter is a nurse, and basically took over. I was not in alot of pain, thanks to pain meds, but believe me, you don't want to plan Thanksgiving this year. Like everyone else has said, let someone else take over. You be the princess and let others pamper you. My daughter helped me with bandaging and cleaning out tubes, etc. for about a week, then I took over. Don't try to do too much too soon. As far as managing other's drama, you need to allow them to work through their own fears about all of this, and I found that one of the best ways to help them, was to have a positive attitude myself. My daughters kept telling me I was in denial, but I don't think I was. I knew that I had a fight ahead of me, but I've had battles before. I knew I was up to the challenge. Being positive, is probably one of your best weapons in this battle.",

I think sex was at the bottom of my list of concerns for most of this year. My husband has been wonderful to this point, but I think he's reaching his limit, and with my reconstructive surgery coming up in October, I don't think I'm going to be up for much for another while. I guess we'll see how long he can hold out. As far as the flu shot is concerned, I've never gotten it and I've never had the flu. I remember back in the 70's when the bird flu was the big scare. My mom got the shot for it, and nearly died from it's effects. I'm really sceptical of it and think I'll take my chances.",

      "Content": "I can't believe how timely this conversation is for me. I just had the second round of reconstruction surgery this last Tuesday. I had a DIEP Flap surgery in December on my right side where I had had the mastectomy, and after several setbacks with abdomen problems where they took the tissue, etc. for the flap, I finally was able to get onto phase 2. It was a three hour surgery where they evened my left side up with my right, got rid of the \"dog ears\" on my abdomen and did some refining on the flap itself. The surgery went great and I was home that night, but I have another drain. Hopefully that will come out this next week. Now I'm looking ahead to nipple construction and tattooing. I had no idea how they made the nipple, so this is all very interesting. I was leaning toward no nipple and just the tattooing. This procedure that you're discussing sounds like something I could handle, but I sure don't want any skin grafting. I guess my next step is to see what my PS says. Right now, I'm just trying to recoup from the latest surgery. This is exactly why I love this discussion board. I don't get on very often, but when I do, I always find answers to the questions and problems I might be having. Thanks ladies! You truly are my sister/angels. Connie",
