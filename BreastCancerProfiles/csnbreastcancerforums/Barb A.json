      "Content": "I'm sorry to hear of your recurrance. I had stage 0 calcifications in 2001, age 37. The calcifications were wide spread in my right breast. I had a mastectomy with tram flap reconstruction and took Tamoxifen for five years. In October 2007 I felt a large lump in the reconstructed breast and soon found out it was stage 3A, IDC. I had a mammogram six months earlier and it wasn't there. My onc said it was a very aggressive, fast growing tumor. No kidding! No node involvement either time. The second time I had a lumpectomy, chemo and rads. I'm now on Arimidex. My surgeon and oncologist disagreed on whether this is a new cancer or a recurrance. They also disagreed on the stage. The surgeon told me it was stage 4, but I obtained my lab reports and through research and discussion with my onc, I go with stage 3A. Even though I try not to dwell on another recurrance or mets, I still think of the probability often. Every ache or pain, that's what my first thought is. I do have some pain in my hip and thigh and a couple areas in my rib/back, but my onc attributes it to Arimidex and sciatica. I've asked for scans or tests to rule out mets, but he won't do them. Peace of mind doesn't count as a reason for asking insurance to pay for tests. It is scary though when I read of others discovering they have mets with the same symptoms. So, I try to ignore them and think positive. Other than joint pain (some days better than others), I have tolerated the Arimidex fairly well. Aside from bc, I am fortunate that I have a wonderful husband, parents, family and friends. I have a good job and enjoy life. I try to focus on all of that and help others through volunteering or just being there for them. I live in Portage, WI and work in Madison, so we're probably two hours away. If you want to contact me separately, please do. Barb",

      "Content": "Hi linpsu. I'm sorry you're going through this again. It is scarier the second time around. When I had a mastectomy, I thought I was done with the possibility of cancer in that side. I had a mastectomy w/tram flap reconstruction in early 2001, no chemo/rads. In October 2007 I found a lump in the reconstructed breast. This was an agressive form of IDC, stage 3. I had a lumpectomy; got clear margins and no node involvement. This was followed by chemo and then rads. I tolerated all of it fairly well. In June it will be two years since finishing rads. I have been on Arimidex for almost two years and for the most part am handling that well. The last couple of months I've had joint/bone pain, but with the WI weather and some arthritis, that may be the cause. My onc wouldn't do any testing the last two years to make sure the treatments got all the cancer. With the joint/bone pain, I finally got him to order a bone scan. Last week I met with him and all is good. The peace of mind sure helps. Try to take it one treatment and day at a time. Get through them and then be diligent in doing your monthly BSEs, eating well, exercising and keeping your regularly scheduled appointments with your onc. I even have my yearly mammo on the reconstructed breast. I admit, when I have an ache, pain or just don't feel well, my first thought is \"it's back\", but then I take a step back and remember it can be anything simple. Yes, it sucks to have a recurrance, but you can fight it, beat it again and live a long life. I plan to. Barb",

      "Content": "Hi Katie. I had a bi-lateral mastectomy with Trampflap reconstruction in 2001 at age 37. I can't speak to the double mastectomy or expanders. I had the same situation with the widespread DCIS in one breast, resulting in the mastectomy versus lumpectomy. I had immediate reconstruction using tissue from my stomach. It went well for me and the reconstructed breast looked acceptable to me - until I had a lumpectomy on the reconstructed side in 2008. With a mastectomy, they can't get all of the tissue and I developed a lump at the base of the reconstructed breast. It left me with another scar and it now has a divet. I use a prostethis to even out my breast size. I could have more surgery, but choose not to. Regardless of what you choose to do, continue doing self-exams on the reconstructed breast(s). My recovery was about six weeks and went well. The first week was bad due to the drains that were placed, but it could have been worse. I didn't have chemo or rads the first time either. Do plenty of research on your options for reconstruction and if needed, get a second opinion. Good luck and keep in touch on the boards. There are some great people here who will provide excellent support. Barb A",

The shape of the reconstructed breast is now starting to change and I don't know what's normal lumps, scar tissue or possible problems. The last few months I have had sharp pains in specific areas off and on. Is that healing from rads? My onc doesn't seem concerned, but then again, he doesn't do any additional testing. He has examined anything I point out to him, but isn't worried. My first doctor wasn't worried about anything until I insisted on a mamogram at age 37. If I waited until 40 like he suggested, I would have had real problems. Is it normal for a reconstructed breast to change shape (buldge in one area only/not near last year's lumpectomy)? Am I overreacting or am I in line if I ask for an MRI or other testing? Thanks for any advice. Barb",
