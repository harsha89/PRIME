    "Content": "I had my port put in a week ago yesterday and it is very sore also still after a week. I can only imagine, like you , how they can administer IV thru it when it's such a sensitive area. My first chemo will be the 25th of this month so please keep me informed as to your progress as well. Hopefully the ports will be more comfortable as time passes..sure saves the veins in the arm (only my right since I had a mastectomy on Jan 7 of the left breast) Did anyone find their own lump? I did, went for a mammogram, it was neg, then on to the Dr a couple of weeks later and he couldn't feel it either..I could and told him exactly where the pea shape bump was. I was told to watch it to see if it changed sizes..and surely it did. Within 4 1/2 weeks it had grown to over 2 cm and at time of removal it was 3 cm in size. I had not invasion anywhere except the lump in the left breast, Thank God for blessings, but have to undergo 6 rounds of chemo , 1 every 3 weeks til over. Have any of you been diagnosed w/mediplastic carsonoma? that was my diagnosis. A rare and aggressive breast cancer I was told. Any infor will be greatly appreciated. Prayers for all Pam",
