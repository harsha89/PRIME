    "Content": "Don't waste your money with Brian Joseph's Lash and eyebrow Gel.  Most people do not lose their eye brows during chemo because they are so slow growing. I was sold 10 containers of Brian Joseph's Lash and eyebrow Gel by Strands Inc in Colorado Springs, CO for $400. There is NO ingrediant in the product that counter acts the effects of chemo. The product has never been scientifically proven to work. Brian Joseph's web site does not allow comments (says it doesn't get involved in social media) so no one is able to leave product reviews. I had 6 months of chemo for breast cancer in 1999 and never lost my eyebrows. I just completed  chemo for ovarian cancer and lost my eyebrows and eyelashes after the 5th of 6 cycles of chemo while using Brian Joseph's product. I complained to Strands that it didn't work. They refused to give my money back. Anyway, I was easily and cheaply able to paint my eyebrows in with an eyebrow pencil so it was not a problem. My eyebrows and eyelashes quickly grew back in. Beware of makeup claims as they do not have to be proven and are not monitored in any way.",
