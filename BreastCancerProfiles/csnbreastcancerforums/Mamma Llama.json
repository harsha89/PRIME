    "Content": "Dear Julie ~ I hope at this point all is going well for you in your post operative treatment. I have worries about the Tamoxifen myself - I am the queen of side effects :) so I will be 'eager' to hear of your experiences. My onco score was just received, only a 13 but given the kind of cancer I had (?) I think I am going to opt for chemo. My challenge -- biggest concern -- is that they only thought I had one point of focus. When they did the surgery to remove the tissues (lumpectomy) and my lymph nodes; the biopsy on the removed breast tissue showed another lesion .55cm, completely independent and malignant in the same general area as the other.....never saw it on ANYTHING: mamo, ultrasound, MRI...didn't \"light up\" like the other did. They did find another area that they wire biopsied and it was deemed benign...only to find this second lesion post operative. I am 47 - have a husband of 27 years (this 05/25) and two daughters, 1 19, the other just turned 13; 4 cats and two baby kittens we are nursing. I have a GREAT deal to live for and I still haven't grown up so... I really really appreciate all the feedback to your question/concern - all the gals have done their homework and then some - especially those brave enough to explore the alternatives offered. I feel GOOD about my decision to tell the oncologist to proceed with chemo though I am sure the side effects will be a bear..this will just be a summer of change and further metamorphsis. I am hopful that your spouses' results were clean...if not, my sorrow and a long distance warm hug and prayers for a good prognosis. God is INDEED good...all the time, L'chaim Stephanie",
