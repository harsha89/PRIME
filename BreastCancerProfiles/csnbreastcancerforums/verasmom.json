    "Content": "Scary stuff girlfriend. Im in a clinical trial, 4 cycles of adriamycin& taxotere. Had my last treatment a week ago and I still feel lousy and have not made it back to the office. I really need to go back to work. Anyone else on this protocol ? How long does it take to stop with the upset tummy. This morning too I had a dizzy spell and had to lie down on the floor. Taking compazine and prescription zantac. I dont think they are doing me much good. Reading these other stories I think I shouldnt be such a whiner but gosh I am so sick and tired of feeling sick and tired.",
