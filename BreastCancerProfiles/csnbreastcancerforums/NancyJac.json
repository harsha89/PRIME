    "Content": "I had a couple of fluid pockets (seromas) after my surgery as well. Had the largest one aspirated but it filled right up again. Mine has always been hard rather than sloshy, but not quite as big as a palm....maybe half that size. The fluid in mine was very thin and sort of a light brown color, blood mixed with serous fluid. Mine also feels sore and warm and red, but that is mostly because it is in the field of the radiation I have just finished. Since yours is more blood filled, sounds a bit more like a hematoma than a seroma. A hemotoma is a pocket of blood that has leaked from a vessel and pooled in surrounding tissue, usually from an injury or surgery.",
