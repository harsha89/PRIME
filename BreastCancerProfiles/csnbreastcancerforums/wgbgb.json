I had the same problem and had to give myself neupogen shots too. It seems like if one thing doesn't bother you for awhile, something else crops up. I'm finished with treatment and my hair is back. Thick and curly. Which is something I've always wanted....I still have aches and pain and I think it is arthritis or inflamation of joints when I don't move enough. I'm sure your co-workers don't understand and I think it is hard to until you go through it. Enjoy tomorrow and every day after. God is truly good and He has you in the palm of his hand.Take care.....Wendy from Green Bay.",

      "Content": "Dear verasmom: I did not have the taxotere,but had 4 treatments of adriamycin and cytoxin. I felt sick for a long time. the best thing for nausea that I found is Anzemet. It is expensive, but if you have insurance it is worth it. I could only get one dose at a time and then if I needed it the next day had to go back to pharmacy. I know its hard, but take one hour at a time and don't think you are a whiner...Also, call your oncology center or doctors office for help. Take care...wgbgb",
