      "Content": "Oh for heaven sakes...what this post is from is because of me. I typed a message line in all caps...as do joke posts, recipie posts, and posts in general...for me I type from a cell phone with itty bitty buttons, deal with pain and numbness inhand and arm from surgeries, so sometimes not having to push buttons up and down is a relief. I don't type things to scream, just how they come out is how they come out, typos, punct errors, wrong spellngs and all Point 2, the msg was not to keep the fire going but to try to figure out what to do...on other sites being flagged is serious and can get you barred from the sight. My msg was saying there was a problem with people including myself and others suddenly being flagged no matter where they post...as with viruses if someone can figure where the problem came from it can be fixed, if it was the inapprpriate action of someone else, fix that... I don't hsve a lot of experience with this site and have no clue who greta is or how to contact her or how to solve problems like this. As with other issues, I was hoping that one of the sisters would say don't worry just do this, or flagging means this but not that... Instead I saw Meagans post, realized it was not being taken the way I had hoped and deleted the thrthread. Instead of the issue going away, this thread is turning into something it never was...marines911 thought it was about him because he uses caps normally, others are joining together to ward off evil, which I am not... So in closing just know that I intended no harm, deleted the post that caused concern and had no ulterior motives. Also I like to think we are all mature enough to realize caps don't mean screaming...seriously, do recipe sharing caps get in your face, or blonde jokes...no because people don't scream here... sadly I have received some pms that some people are leaving the board because it has become so petty this week...i love yall but maybe they have the right idea...",

I have thought about leaving and tried to start over, but it really bothers me watching so many jumping in the opinion pool when you yourdelf state you have no clue what it is about...it is in fact about nothing...and as to caps being so offensive then all 40 plus of you should address that to the people who try to cheer you up with jokes, and recipe sharing, etc,,,,and in closing I have to say I am not offended by caps, I am offended by poverty, and homeless families with children, and people going without food, and our sisters going without dx or tx because of insurance problems...that is what I think offensive...and as far as jumping onn the bandwagon it is no better than not voting but having a bowl full of mush to say about what is wrong and what you don't like...i told you before that people would leave....i don't think anyone should have to leave...but if what this board has become is grammar police and gossip sheep, then this board has truly lost it's way...i know you all as beautiful caring people...we all have a right to be here, we all have a right to feel pain or happy, boredom or mad...we don't need to become pompous judgemental individuals...i really am tired of megans post, I am tired of the insurance post, I am tired of people having to explain themselves...this is a free speech country...i am tired of people not feeling welcome anymore, I am tired of people leaving...just stop reaaly enough kaput fini",
