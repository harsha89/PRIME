I have two more to go then will be done, I hope.I guess what I'm trying to say is that the chemo is different for everyone, and the Dr's. can manage the nausea and pain if you have it, just tell them. and you have all the support here you will need, the girls have been a big help to me, they are wonderful!!! please keep us posted as how you are doing. You will be in my prayers. Love and GOD Bless you.---------Flo",
