In my mind I should not have to because the margins were clean and so was the lymphnode..........so why chemo??? Because my Her2 was positive, thats why. I prayed that God would give me His Peace if I was to go through with the Chemo. He gave it to me when we were sitting there talking to the Dr. So I will be starting it Jan. 14th. I will be praying that you too receive that same peace as you make your decision for what is best for you life. God Bless, Angel",

I will be praying for you that God's peace consumes you. Keep us updated. BIG HUGS, Angel",
