    "Content": "I never had A/C treatment, but I did have Taxol for about 6 months. They had to give me benedryl before the Taxol could be administerd because it can cause severe allergic reations. They also had to give me some sort of steroid along with it. I was really tired, achy, and naustious about the 3rd day after treatment. I was told that the affects were actually 10 days delayed, but I'm pretty sure that I was feeling affected 3 days later. Of course there is also the loss of hair, but that's pretty typical. Hang in there! You are in my thoughts and prayers! Take Care and God Bless, Sherry",
