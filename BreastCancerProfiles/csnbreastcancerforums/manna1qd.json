      "Content": "call the acs and your local hospitals for groups, then go and try them. They have different characteristics. I couldn't find one that worked for me when I was first diagnosed. I wish I had this site then because this is what I really needed. I needed to talk with other women in my shoes and then some who were way past where I was. You get what you need, when you need it here. The plus about a local group is you have face to face relationships and that's worth something. Also, I called Y-me to talk when I was a bit of a basket case. Good luck.",

      "Content": "This is a great post. Thanks phoenix! Well, I couldn't handle it either. I didn't want to fight. I wanted to be cured though. It took me awhile to figure out why I was scared and depressed even though I had a good prognosis. My well meaning plastic surgeon told me I was cured. I finally realized what was going on. A breast specialist was a group leader at a conference i went to. she put it in perspective (used the example about not knowing if cancer kills you until something else or it does too) She said it's a like a chronic disease. You can't say, \"I am cured\" You will always need to be on top of it. If it returns, you will need to manage it and so on. Finally, I realized that I will always live with \"it\" and that helped me learn how to cope. I knew then, I wasn't a crazy, ungrateful patient who was cured. But, I wasn't in denial either. I will give some people credit for their attitude. Some may really know somehow that they will be ok, that the cancer will not come back. I think it's more a mind body connection than an act of will if it exists at all. I did what I could and I turned it over to my higher power to worry about. And I turn it over every day. I am weak but that is when the strenth of turning it over comes through! BTW, my higher power is Jesus. I also prefer the title, \"more than a conquerer\" over survivor. Surviving isn't thriving. I don't think in terms of conquering cancer. I don't respect it enough to give it a life force or personality. It's a thing and it is present or not. The conquering is about living in the present, hoping for the future, having the courage to do what you need to do, taking the risks to live the way you were meant to live, stuff like that. Loved reading this one from all of you :)",
