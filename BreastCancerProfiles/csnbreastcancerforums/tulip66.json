      "Content": "Yes, to all the side effects you have listed. My eyelashes and eyebrows really thinned a couple of months ago and now it seems they are growing in again. I have joint pain and muscle stiffness but not everyday. It seems to come in spurts for me. I am will finish with my 52nd treatment of Herceptin in August. Last week they let me know that we no longer need to take Tylenol and benedryl with it. I'm glad because the sleepiness would ruin the rest of my day. Sometimes with my symptoms I can't figure out if it is residual from the Taxol or radiation? I finished radiation in January but I think it stills affects me sometimes. I was also put into early menopause (I'm 37) and I think that also saps your energy? What our poor bodies have to go through! You are definitely not alone with your symptoms.",

      "Content": "Hi Jane - The reasoning behind taking Tylenol & benedryl with the Herceptin is that Herceptin has a mouse compound in it...exactly what it is I am not sure. No wonder I am eating so much cheese :-)! Well, it is some kind of protein. But it also has human proteins in it. Last week they announced that the amount of mice that is in Herceptin is not significant enough to warrant continued use of Tylenol & benedryl...due to very low allergic reactions. My Onc.'s are very conservative and that is why I probably was on it in case I would have an reaction. Once I sat next to a lady that went into shock from Carboplatin and that was a scary thing to see (they had given her Benedryl already too!). I was ER- so they don't have me taking Arimidex or Tamoxifen. Sounds like we have lived a very similar year. I had 4 rounds dose-dense A/C; then surgery; then 12 weeks Taxol/Herceptin and now 40 weeks just Herceptin. What a ride! Don't worry the lashes do come back. It truly freaked me out to see them coming out again. I had lost every hair on my body with the Taxol and didn't want that to happen again. Take care and lets try to keep in touch. Ruth",

      "Content": "Jean, Your reality is a great fear of mine. I am on Herceptin and have been on it since Aug 2003. Luckily my Onc. is very conservative and has me checked every three months with a MUGA or Echo. My EF also went down slightly in the beginning but has remained stable. I go in for another ECHO this month for my 3 month check. I will keep you in my prayers and hope that your EF will improve. The cardiologist that I go to said that sometimes drug induced reductions of EF can get better once the drug is stopped. I pray that this happens for you. Hummer wrote that she is getting a cough and slight swelling of her ankles. I hope that she insists on getting her heart checked. We will all think of you and wish you well. Ruth",
