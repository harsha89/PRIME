    "Content": "I had a right side mastectomy 2 years ago. So far I have chosen not to reconstruct. I've done alot of research and my personal opinion is the negatives (complications, recovery time, ect.) outweigh the positives. The only type of reconstruction I would consider would be DIEP, which is similar to a TRAM without having to take the muscle from the abdomen. Unfortunately I don't think it's available in my state. Whatever you decide to do, research it. I think alot of doctors have the attitude that it is not a big deal. Also if you belong to a support group you could ask about the experience of other's in the group. good luck! shelly",
