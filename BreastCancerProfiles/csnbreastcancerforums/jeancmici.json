If you hadn't been feeling so bad you would not have cried and also would have not been chastised by him (?) to cause you to cry. Don't be intimidated. I would change the primary care doctor - I take Prozac and swear it made the whole ordeal easier. If people are honest I think they will admit that they are more tired than before all the treatments. Also think the tamoxifen has some effect on energy too. I have aches all over - fortunately not all at the same time but everyday - however retirement helps me a lot too. Don't resign yet. And give your boss some educational information - obviously you were doing all right to get the promotion. Good Luck - keep us informed when you feel up to it. Jean",

From what I've read, the results are very good as it is usually a local disease due to the radiation. Good Luck! Jean You might click into google.com with\"breast cancer after hodgkins\"",

I could not have received encouragement as here from an inanimate website. I have made some good friends here on the site and we write directly. I feel a kinship with all of you here. When I don't see a person anymore I wonder how she is doing. and I mourn for those who leave us not because of choice. CSN is a community unlike an informational website which is invaluable - more from the medical side.

Usually AC (Adriamycin & Cytoxan) are used now, but they usually give the MUGA test to your heart first and if that indicates your heart is not strong enough, then CFM - usually called CMF.

Took Herceptin from Dec. 1st weekly including the 17th of May - no heart checks. Had more and more coughing which got worse so when the 24th and the monthly onco's visit came due, I took an overnight bag with me and got a wheelchair at the door of the cancer hospital. Can you believe - I had to do a little persuasion to get him to admit me!!!! Had an echocardiogram that afternoon - ejection fraction of 20. In Feb. 2001 before adriamycin I had a 59 EF. Saw the cardiologist for the first rime on tuesday who gave me the bad news. Said my onco was right on the mark to admit me - this needed inpatient supervision to get regulated. I had to say - well, he was right on the mark after some persuasion from me - damn - how hard the patient must work these days. Anyway I seem to have responded well to Vasotec, Lasix, and Aldactone along with the other 6 meds I still take - sigh........ In June I may be taking another chemo instead of the navelbine. Last of that was the 10th - WBC too low on the 17th. I missed my zometa infusion the 24th but will probably continue that in June. That's my update - I am not a happy camper - but the week in the hospital was a real rest for me who lives alone. Coughing subsided on Wednesday and my biggest job was filling out the meal menu each day. Love to all - keep me in your prayers as I will for all of you. Jean",

The last sentence says we must be our own advocate. Damn! that is so annoying and maddening. The specialists should be looking out for our best interests instead of all of us having to do the homework along with being sick, worried, and often unknowing of a lot of things that the god-doctors know but wait for us to holler. I am not a complainer and really had no idea how serious HER2neu is so having had osteoarthritis for years just did not pay close enuf attention to back discomfort. Add the fact that I do not have a pain threshold low like some people who pop a pill at the slightest twinge, I had a grand case of bone mets before *I* hollered - and even the first time I mentioned what seemed like more pain, it was not really listened to. Why am i mad at myself? Well, why did I not even consider bone mets when I had bone pain - why did I think it was the vacuuming or awkward movement mot remembered that was causing it. How DUMB can one get????? Me, who had a medical library of books long before computers were common and drug books with pictures and side effects - the whole scoop. I was so informed but so dumb when this was going on. Forgive me for ranting on - getting it off my chest to whoever will read this. How many of you had bone scans at the time of diagnosis or after treatment was completed? How I wish I were in that group!

I get hot flashes sometimes - mostly in the evening while I'm trying to read or watch TV, but otherwise if I'm not cleaning etc. I feel cooler than I should according to the temperature. I think that is why I could stand France last summer without air conditioning. Sometimes Tamoxifen causes hair thinning in just a small percentage of people. I think I have that and it annoys me more than the cool/hot condition. I think we all hate to complain about these little things which daily wears me down at least and probably many other women. But in the long run, we all say it beats cancer returning. Hoping you will feel better or more comfortable soon. Jean",
