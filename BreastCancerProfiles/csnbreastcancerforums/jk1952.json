      "Content": "I thought that I had just posted a response. Fortunately, I had copied much of it from another post I had done a few months ago. Hope it helps. (The answer to your sepcific question is sweats and a loose, butoon fron top). As far as the hospital is concerned, I'd take a toiletries bag with toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant, tissues, etc. They'll probably give you everything that you need, but I'd rather use my own. You will want loose fitting button or zipper front tops, and you'll have to take loose fitting PJ's or sweats, since you won't be able to wear normal pants for a while. I took a bathrobe and did use that some. I love to read, but I couldn't really concentrate well enough in the hospital, so magazines were good, as was my iPod. Although some hospitals won't allow cellphones, mine not only allows them, they encourage that you use one. It's easy to carry and you won't have to try to reach for a phone. You won't want to reach for anything for a while. I didn't need any cash, but it's probably good to have a little. For a couple days, you'll probably be very happy to be in the hospital gown, so try not to overpack, since there is limited space in the room. Onto recovery. With this surgery, you'll probably have six drains initially, although some may come out before you go home. Drains are a pain, but they are critical to your recovery, so don't try to rush them. While you are dressed, they'll be pinned to some of your clothing, but showering is a different story. I used a 'lanyard' around my neck when I showered, and pinned the drains to it. It didn't get wet and weighted down like washcloths or towels do. You'll have a hard time stretching and getting in and out of bed. I found a recliner to be very helpful. With time, I recovered the range of motion and could return to normal activity, without any type of physical therapy. Unlike the reconstruction with expanders, you won't be able to bind your breasts, because you need to keep the blood flow unconstrained. I used camis and tank tops with a loose shelf bra for eight weeks before I was allowed to wear a bra again. You'll likely have an abdominal binder for a period of time. It really does make you feel better! Things I would have at hand: at least four extra pillows (you'll sleep on your back and you'll want them to support your arms, legs and extra support for head), Tylenol or Advil for when you come off the painkillers, baby aspirin (my doctor wanted me to take it for a few weeks after surgery), thermometer (if you don't have one, in case you're worried that you might have an infection), antibiotic cream and bandages (they could come in handy), and a cellphone nearby. My husband did email updates to friends and relatives, so he didn't have to take as many calls, and he could let people know when I was ready for calls or company. He also ran interference with phone calls and sometimes told the person that I was resting or had crashed after doing too much (which I did often). Joyce",

      "Content": "I am very happy with the results, and I would highly recommend it. Recovery, drains and pain are all about the same as people described for the DIEP. It's a long surgery, so it does take a while to regain strength after being under the anesthesia for so long. I was amazed by how difficult it was to walk down the street, when I first tried. But, every day I felt better and better. I was out of work for eight weeks, and if forced, I probably could have gone back sooner. I was doing a little work at home when I felt like it after a couple weeks. But, it was sitting at a computer; it wasn't being active. You do need lots of help with housework and meals. I could take care of myself, but was appreciative of help with things around the house. I only took the narcotics for two days after surgery and was able to control the pain with Tylenol or Motrin. The morphine caused a terrible flush, which was quite uncomfortable and I had a bad headache the day after surgery, so these bothered me more than the actual surgeries. Because I didn't continue taking the painkillers, I was able to start driving after only 2-1/2 weeks. I was told that if I could twist to see and felt that I could react if needed, I could start driving. I had six drains initially: two in the abdomen and two in each breast. I went home with four, one in each breast and two in my abdomen. I wore loose comfy clothes and pinned the drains to the insides of my tops or to the wasteband. When I took a shower, I pinned them to a 'lanyard' around my neck. They were a pain, but the alternatives are worse. I had no problems when they were removed: I really didn't feel it. Hope this helps. It is major surgery, but it was so good for my well-being to wake up with breasts. It really helped in my healing process. Joyce",

I actually had one breast reconstructed using DIEP and one with the free TRAM flap. The surgeries are very much alike; it just depends on if they have to use any muscle and which blood vessels are used. Since one of my breasts had been radiated, and had some blood vessel issues, they chose the free TRAM flap in order to get the 'best' vessels, while the 'good' breast was reconstructed using the DIEP. I can't really tell a difference in the two breasts or the two sides of my abdomen. Joyce",

I took eight weeks off from work, and I was glad that I did. The last couple weeks of the recovery were more like vacation, but I still tired after 6 - 8 hours of activity. At first, I was amazed at how hard it was to even walk any distance. I felt soooo out of shape, and sucking air. But, that improves very quickly, as you have more exercise. I was on my computer the day I left the hospital, but I have a very small laptop (3 lbs), so I could use it anywhere, as long as I had a pillow under it. I hope your surgery goes extremely well and that recovery is easy. I'd be glad to answer any questions you might have. Joyce",

The post that she mentions is on her Expressions, so you now click on 'Expressions'. You can read the beginning of the post from here, or you can click 'Read more' for the entire post. She also refers you to the web page Mammosite.com. Most women who are part of CSN have had regular radiation, so they are not too familiar with mammosite, but there are a few with some experience. You may notice that some of the old posts have a lot of disagreement about this procedure. It's still new, so somewhat unproven, but I had stereotactic and sentinel lymph node biopsies when they were very new, and ten years later they are the standard of care. Your doctor is the best person to help you understand the risks and rewards of any treatment. It's good to learn as much as possible about any procedure or treatment but there are a lot of websites that give you bad information, so it's really best to seek information from doctors that you trust and respect.

      "Content": "Ruthie, welcome to the boards, but sorry that you have the beast that makes you eligible for membership. I'm particularly sorry that you've had problems with your lumpectomies and not being able to get clean margins. It's so hard to go into an operation thinking you'll be able to move forward afterwards, to find that you need yet another surgery. I chose to have a bilateral mastectomy and immediate reconstruction using a DIEP procedure, instead of only a single mastectomy. I had invasive lobular cancer in my right breast in 2000 which was treated with a lumpectomy and radiation. Earlier this year, DCIS was found in the same breast. I decided on the bilateral partly because I knew that I could only have the tummy tuck once, so if I need a mastectomy sometime in the future, I would need a different type of reconstruction. I had had biopsies of the other breast, in past years, so that was another reason to have it all done at once. Both times, I was at peace with the decision that I made, and I think that they were the right decisions for that time of my life. (If I weren't doing the reconstruction, I probably would have chosen to save the breast with no disease, since I like original parts, whenever possible). I think that any of these options is a fine alternative, if it keeps the cancer away. And, you need to make a decision that's right for you. Since you are still having doubts, I would pose the question to a trusted doctor, 'how would you advise a loved one'? When I talked to my surgeon about it, she did help me work through my concerns and questions, and I then felt confident that I was making the right decision, for me. Joyce",

I've only had shooting pains a couple times, and it was a minute or less of a sharp pain, but it wasn't something that I even thought about afterwards. I actually experienced this with lumpectomies, but not with the mastectomy. As far as the 'feeling' is concerned, it doesn't really bother me, although I really dreaded it. I only notice it when I rub against something or put on deodorant, and it is a lot better than right after surgery. It's not really a numbness, just no feeling. Actual numbness would be much worse. I had also read about women being in extreme pain after the surgery, like they had been hit by a truck. My major complaints after the surgery were a wicked headache and flushing from the anesthetic and the morphine. After I started taking on Tylenol and Motrin, I was much better, and they really did control my pain. I know this is hard to do, but try not to think about it too much. Hopefully, you'll find like I did that your expectations are much worse than the reality. Joyce",

      "Content": "DMC gave you a lot of great advice. There's really nothing that I can add. I developed blood clots after I had taken Tamoxifen for 6 months. I was out of work for quite a few days and then when I returned, I worked only a couple hours a day and built back up to full time. I actually missed much more work from this than from the lumpectomy and radiation I also had that year. I do have the Factor 5 Leiden (I call it a mutant gene), and it is my understanding that almost 100% of blood clots are in people who have this. If you don't a blood clot is quite rare. Joyce",

      "Content": "I worked during radiation and it was good for me to have something else to think about other than cancer. Nine years later, I took eight weeks off recovering from a bilateral mastectomy and DIEP reconstruction. Both were the right decisions, at the time. I think that it depends a lot on where you are psychologically. Do you need to keep active in order to heal more quickly or would taking time off help the healing process more? I'm sure that you'll find the strength to work, if you decide that's the best thing for you. Joyce",
