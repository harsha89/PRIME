To know we were helping all women who can not afford to be tested and treated,and to know we are helping to put a stop to this terrible disease.(I was in tears alot).We will be doing our next one in OCT. The best was the 83 YR. old women who walked and has been a survivor for 10 yrs.It was just the greatest!! Take Care Lorie",
