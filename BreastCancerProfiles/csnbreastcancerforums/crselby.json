      "Content": "I want as much as anybody to be safe from crazy bombers but this has to change! They get NO training on dealing with breast prostheses? ? ! ~~Connie~~ By Suzanne Choney msnbc.com msnbc.com 2010-11-19T22:31:32 A longtime Charlotte, N.C., flight attendant and cancer survivor told a local television station that she was forced to show her prosthetic breast during a pat-down. Cathy Bossi, who works for U.S. Airways, said she received the pat-down after declining to do the full-body scan because of radiation concerns. The TSA screener \"put her full hand on my breast and said, 'What is this?' \" Bossi told the station. \"And I said, 'It's my prosthesis because I've had breast cancer.' And she said, 'Well, you'll need to show me that.' \" Bossi said she removed the prosthetic from her bra. She did not take the name of the agent, she said, \"because it was just so horrific of an experience, I couldn't believe someone had done that to me. I'm a flight attendant. I was just trying to get to work.\" For Americans who wear prosthetics \u2014 either because they are cancer survivors or have lost a limb \u2014 or who have undergone hip replacements or have a pacemaker, the humiliation of the TSA's new security procedures \u2014 choosing between a body scan or body search \u2014 is even worse. Musa Mayer has worn a breast prosthesis for 21 years since her mastectomy and is used to the alarms it sets off at airport security. But nothing prepared her for the \"invasive and embarrassing\" experience of being patted down, poked and examined recently while passing through airport security at Dulles International Airport in Washington, D.C. \"I asked the supervisor if she realized that there are 3 million women who have had breast cancer in the U.S., many of whom wear breast prostheses. Will each of us now have to undergo this humiliating, time-consuming routine every time we pass through one of these new body scanners?\" she said in an e-mail to msnbc.com. 'I was so humiliated' Marlene McCarthy of Rhode Island said she went through the body scanner and was told by a TSA agent to step aside. In \"full view of everyone,\" McCarthy said in an e-mail, the agent \"immediately put the back of her hand on my right side chest and I explained I wore a prosthesis. \"Then, she put her full hands ... one on top and one on the bottom of my 'breast' and moved the prosthesis left, right, up, down and said 'OK.' I was so humiliated. \"I went to the desk area and complained,\" McCarthy wrote. \"The woman there was very nice and I asked her if the training included an understanding of how prosthetics are captured on the scanner and told her the pat-down is embarrassing. She said, 'We have never even had that discussion and I do the training for the TSA employees here, following the standard manual provided.' She said she will bring it up at their next meeting.\" If she has to go through the scanner again, McCarthy said, \"I am determined to put the prosthesis in the gray bucket,\" provided to travelers at the security check-ins for items such as jewelry. \"Let the TSA scanners be embarrassed .... not me anymore!\" she wrote. Sharon Kiss, 66, has a pacemaker, but also has to fly often for her work. \"During a recent enhanced pat-down, a screener cupped my breasts and felt my genitals,\" she said in an e-mail to msnbc.com \"To 'clear my waistband' she put her hands down my pants and groped for the waistband of my underwear. \"I expressed humiliation and was told 'You have the choice not to fly.' \" The remark infuriated Kiss, who lives in Mendocino, Calif. \"Extrapolate this to we should not provide curb cuts and ramps for people confined to wheelchairs because they can choose to stay home ... This a violation of civil rights. And because I have a disability, I should not be subjected to what is government-sanctioned sexual assault in order to board a plane.\" So far, the government is not letting up on the enhanced screening program. TSA administrator John Pistole said this week at a Congressional hearing on the matter that \"reasonable people can disagree\" on how to properly balance safety at the nation's airports, but that the new security measures are necessary because of intelligence on latest attack methods that might be used by terrorists. Gail Mengel, of Blue Springs, Mo., is used to being patted down; she had a hip replacement five years ago. .\"I admit that I was relieved when I flew last week and was able to spend a few seconds in front of the X-ray screen in Seattle and Denver,\" she said in an e-mail to msnbc.com. \"I have heard medical experts say the level of radiation will not hurt us. And frankly I was happy to realize I won't have my body touched, patted and rubbed anymore. \"Unfortunately last weekend, I arrived at the New Orleans airport and learned that airport staff (was) still being trained in using the X-ray machine. Because my hip replacement sets off the security buzzer, I was faced with the new regulations.\" While she is \"used to\" being patted down, \"this experience was certainly much more personal, uncomfortable and embarrassing,\" she said. \"Every part of my body was touched. I do not want to be harmed by radiation, but the experience was painless and quick compared to what I have faced over the last five years. I support security measures but I also hope we can be assured of safe procedures.\" One man, from Nashville, wrote in an e-mail that \"as a handicapped person, I am sick and tired of being 'raped' at the security line. I lose my crutches and leg orthotics to be 'nuked' by the X-ray machine. Then manhandled by the pat-down, followed by chemical swabbing for 'possible explosives.' ...Enough is enough.\" Said Mayer, the longtime breast cancer survivor: \"I am outraged that I will now be forced to show my prosthesis to strangers, remove it and put in the X-ray bin for screening, or not to wear it at all whenever I fly. To me, this seems unfairly discriminatory and embarrassing for me, and for all breast cancer survivors.\" © 2010 msnbc.com Reprints",

The incision bothers her since she is still very large after losing nearly 100 pounds and the lower abdominal skin sort of flops over it. But she took the pain meds one day and after that only regular Tylenol. Constipation was her motivation to get off them. She hasn't been released to drive yet and, since she lives alone, that bugs her. Gives her friends a chance to step in! Anyway, if a hysterectomy gives you peace of mind, I hope you can find the strength of spirit to do it. Sooner or later. ~~Connie~~",

My blood gets hot when people think the space program is a waste of money. So many medical advances are directly tied to developments done as part of the space program. Other things in daily life have come from it too, like Teflon (I'm not a fan, but my mother was)and Velcro. I wouldn't deny a hungry person food to put those dollars into the space program, but what has come out of it directly and indirectly is INVALUABLE. It is short sighted to cut its funding, but ... when times are tough.... it has been an easy target. With each successful launch, mission, and landing, manned or unmanned, I give kudos to the thousands of dedicated people whose joined efforts make it possible and the brave souls who risk their lives to stretch our knowledge and understanding of what an awesome universe we are part of.

As I was creating my last post, to hug or not to hug, I received a call that my MRI biopsy for tomorrow has been cancelled.  The radiologist just got back from a week's vacation and reviewed my old films and cancelled it.  I had been lobbying for that since one of the 2 spots seen in the MRI has been there since 2009 in repeated MRIs and was deemed 'stable and benign' in 2010. The radiologist had access to the old MRIs from the beginning.  Why did he schedule the biopsy after an MRI on April 16 without comparing old films?  I've been stressed for 11 days worrying about this.  In fact, as I left the appointment with the surgeon, who gave me the MRI results and need for MRI biopsy, on Friday April 17 I asked her if there was someone I could talk to about anxiety.  She said oh yes they have a great clinical psychologist she's wonderful yes she'll get me an appt.  Well, it's April 28th, they just cancelled the MRI biopsy (yay, I think).  So I want to move up the Friday appt to look at treatment options, but I get the \"leave a message\" thing from surgeon's scheduler.  I called MDAnderson back because I felt tears rising in my eyes to see if I can make my own appt with the \"great\" clinical psychologist.  Absolutely not.  So I explained to that person that my surgeon was going to put in that order but I haven't heard anything yet, over a week later.  So that person looks for an order and, oh yes, there it is.  Wait wait I say, when was that order put in?  Friday, she replies (today is Tuesday).  So she gives me a number for the surgeon's scheduler person.  I don't really understand why but OK.  I just called that number and get the \"leave a message and someone will get back to you within 24 hours.\"  My message started out pretty clearly, giving the spelling of my last name and my date of birth like they asked but then it deteriorated into a scared shaky voice of someone whining about not being too happy with the great new MD Anderson Cancer Clinic here in AZ.  This is my second time around with breast cancer and, as I said in my message, \"I'm NOT feeling the love from MD Anderson. Call me back or I can go somewhere else for treatment.\"   Maybe I shouldn't have said the last part because, after all, who wants to have surgeons working on you that you have whined to and cried to and threatened to leave? Sometimes I hate our healthcare system. ~~Connie~~",

I have never really thought of my breast cancer as a beast or even something outside myself that needed to be fought. When diagnosed, my first thought was that my body had betrayed me. Even now, I think of cancer as my body 'gone bad'. These cells originated within me. They proliferated because another part of my system was not up to par (to kill them). They are part of ME, just errant. Like petulant little boys. I imagine the cancer as MY cells, just unwelcome ones. So, I want to imagine the majority of my GOOD cells overwhelming the errant ones and consuming them. It's a battle going on inside of me, but it's all me. The Tamoxifen helps me keep the cancer cells from growing by starving them to death. The cancer cells are no more of a beast to me than, say, my gray hair!

      "Content": "Dear, scared, sweet, Sister, Welcome to The Nightmare. And Merry Christmas. When I was first diagnosed I had some of the same feelings and thoughts. Even before I had seen a surgeon to talk about treatments, I was worried about chemo, cost, etc. At least that is what I was expressing out loud. Inside I was ANGRY beyond expression. How could this happen to ME? The thing about this cancer is, often, it is diagnosed out of the blue, without your feeling ill, without your having any risk factors. So when you hear those incredibly dreaded words, \"You've got breast cancer\" you are caught off guard. A first human response could be anger. How could my body betray me like this? What did I do to deserve this? But there is also a tendency to deny what is being told to you. Heck, you feel OK, how could you be needing such extreme treatment, right? Well, part of my denial was to think about how I couldn't afford this disease and its treatments. I'm trying to help a son go through college. And to talk about how I would go INSANE if I had to sit quietly while poison was dripped into my veins. Or if I had to lay still while machines zapped my flesh to crisps. But, but, there's always a but. I read on this discussion board how many women have gone through this and said \"it's do-able\". They are honest in their assessment, not overly simplifying things, like the doctors. As it turned out, I didn't need chemo but did need radiation. I chose a shortened version that required grueling, torturous set-up (see my expressions page), but then it was over in 5 days. And the healing is easy. The fear that rears up in the beginning reduces to a managible level once your treatment plan is in place, if you've made informed decisions. So does the anger. I hope neither fear, nor anger, nor denial interfere with your making informed, smart, best-for-you decisions. And that may include, as it did for some of the women who already replied to your post, saying no to chemo! Knowing your oncotype score may help! Just say it for the right reasons. Your family wants you around for a long long time. Other women have done it and gone on to have very happy, fruitful, plentiful lifes, without regrets. Good luck with your decision, Jaime.",

The word of my breast cancer spread quickly (my fellow instructors let it slip) and I received so much out pouring of concern and prayers! I was not teaching that semester, so much was expressed via email.

      "Content": "New Compound Shows Promise in Combating Cancer Professor Donna Zhang and her team showed that brusatol, together with chemotherapy treatment, can combat chemoresistance, increase cell death, reduce cell proliferation and a reduce tumor growth. UA researchers have shown that a compound from the fruit of the Brucea javanica tree, when used in combination with chemotherapy, reduces cell proliferation and causes a reduction in tumor growth. By Rebecca Ruiz-McGill, University Communications, January 28, 2011 Resistance to chemotherapy is a major obstacle limiting the successful treatment of cancer patients. The discovery of a novel antioxidant compound by a group of University of Arizona researchers led by pharmacology and toxicology assistant professor Donna D. Zhang has proven its ability to combat chemoresistance and enhance the efficacy of current chemotherapeutic drugs. Zhang also is a member of the Arizona Cancer Center. The finding, reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, represents a breakthrough in the effectiveness of cancer treatment. The key to the discovery is an understanding of the transcription factor, or movement of genetic information of the protein Nrf2. Nrf2 regulates a multitude of genes that promote cell survival under detrimental environments, such as oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is associated with an imbalance between the production and removal of chemically reactive molecules containing oxygen known as reactive oxygen species. During times of oxidative stress, the body's ability to detoxify and repair damage is disrupted and has been implicated in cancer and other diseases. The ability of cells to properly regulate the Nrf2 defense response is important to protect against the damaging effects of oxidative stress. Normally, Nrf2 is expressed at very low levels in most organs of the body. But recent studies have shown that high levels of Nrf2 are present in many types of tumors. These studies, Zhang said, \"suggested that Nrf2 has a dark side.\" \"Clearly, the control mechanism of Nrf2 has been hijacked by the cancer cells, and the high levels of Nrf2 are creating an environment for cancer cells to survive and thrive and promote chemoresistance,\" she added. Her team searched for antioxidant compounds that were able to inhibit the Nrf2 defense response mechanism and found that brusatol, a quassinoid isolated from the fruit of the Brucea javanica tree, is a unique inhibitor of the Nrf2 pathway. Zhang's team showed that brusatol can combat chemoresistance associated with cisplatin treatment, a platinum-based chemotherapy drug. Through a reduction in the protein level of Nrf2, brusatol is able to sensitize cancer cells to therapeutic treatments. Their results show that when brusatol is used in combination with cisplatin, there is an increase in cell death, reduced cell proliferation, and a reduction in tumor growth compared to cisplatin treatment alone. Zhang said, \"As a result of this study, interest has been raised to develop brusatol into a commercial product that can be used in the clinic to enhance the effectiveness of current cancer treatments and combat chemoresistance.\" This study was supported by grants from the American Cancer Society and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.",

      "Content": "Hi Vikiviki, You've found a great place from which to get good, first-hand information. The women and men who post here have a wide variety of experiences that they'll share. I had one cluster of calcifications show up on my last annual mammogram. No ultrasound was done since they don't usually show up on that type of imaging. So I had a stereotactic core needle biopsy done and the pathology report was DCIS. Ugh. Before the surgeon I chose would do the lumpectomy to remove it, she wanted more images taken with an MRI. That machine shows things that mammography and ultrasound don't see. But the results often show things that turn out to be benign. The MRI showed 2 spots in the breast already known to have DCIS, and one spot in the other. So back I went for MRI guided biopsies. UGH. Both spots in the already affected breast were benign and the spot in the other breast didn't show up, so they couldn't biopsy it. (It 'went away'.) So I had lumpectomy surgery (no lymph node involvemnt with DCIS so no surgery needed in armpit) in July. Had brachytherapy radiation in September, and I was done. The docs want to follow you closely once you've had a cancer diagnosis, so I've had my next, 6 month follow up MRI and, dam, if that elusive spot in the 'unaffected' breast isn't back! I'm telling you all this because often a reading of calcification clusters requires more tests and images and it tends to freak the person out. It's standard-operating-procedure, though, for the docs to want as much info before they do anything, so don't be surprised if they want you to have more images as well as the biopsies. Post again if you have more questions. We'll all be hoping for you that the calcifications turn out to be 'nothing'!!!! ~~Connie~~",

Before I had the endometrial polypectomy 3 weeks ago I asked if ablation would be a good idea since I am on Tamoxifen (4 years to go) and still have my uterus. My wonderful gynocologist said not to do it. It would make things worse. Instead of endometrial cancer perhaps forming (thank you Tamioxifen), it would most likely be uterine cancer. Endometrial cancer would likely be found before it has spread. Not so with uterine cancer. So, consequently, I'll go for (and pay for) more frequent uterine ultrasounds (caught these 2 polyps that formed in under a year) and pap smears. ~~Connie~~",

The destination you thought you were headed to may have just gotten changed. But it will be OK. Many of us before you have had the same surprise, and we have weathered it. We are here to give you support and advice. You may not think so now, but you'll be OK. Here's my experience. In April 2009 my annual screening mammogram showed something suspicious. So I had a diagnostic mammogram done a few weeks later. Looked even more suspicious, as they showed me the 'micro-calcifications'. I researched it a lot and found that if they were indications of cancer, it was most likely Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS). To add to the confusion, some researchers say DCIS is not cancer, because it's not invasive. So I put off having the micro calcs biopsied for over a month, thinking perhaps they did NOT indicate cancer, or they may indicate DCIS, which some people take a wait-and-see attitude with. But something bugged me and I had the stereotactic core needle biopsy (SCNB) the radiologist was recommending. Not a fun experience. It absolutely was DCIS, high grade, meaning aggressively growing. Glad I didn't wait. Consulted with a close friend who was going through early stage breast cancer treatment two months ahead of me. Used her surgeon and radiologist. I was caught off guard that the surgeon wanted sonograms and MRIs of both breasts before surgery. This was to rule out any further involvement of either breast with any kind (same or different) of cancer. If the MRIs found more, the treatment would have been different. That led to two more biopsies (MRI guided) in that same breast. That was even less fun than the SCNB. But it showed all else was clear! Yay! I had a lumpectomy and brachytherapy (5 day radiation). I am almost 5 months post radiation. I am taking Tamoxifen but will revisit that decision in March when I see my docs again. My advice is to bite the bullet and have the biopsy. Don't play ostrich. Pull up your big girl panties and do what must be done to keep yourself healthy. Knowledge is power. ~~Connie~~",
