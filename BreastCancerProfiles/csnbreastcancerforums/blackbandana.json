I'm surprised that the are doing chemo and then surgery, I thought they did either or first not together. I hope all goes well for your girlfriend. Could your girlfriend not use your computer/access to post?",

My side effects were back pain and blurred vision, I told my onco that I didn't want to take it any more, I told her that I was stopping taking it and she immediately put me on Arimidex, on this over 6 mths now and no real side effects to report so far. Please, if you are in doubt of using Tamoxifen, then don't take it, there are a lot of drugs out there, you just have to persist with your doctor. Take care",

I did a test myself and stopped taking it and the pain went away immediately and when I started back on it the pain started again. I told my onco and she put me on Arimdex, now I'm suffering with really bad skin/pimples and I'm 38... so I did the same sort of test and had the same result, but I'd rather pimples than back/leg and foot pain. Do a test it should only take about 2 weeks. I hope this helps..... best wishes.",
