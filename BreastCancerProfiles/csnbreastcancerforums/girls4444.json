      "Content": "Congratulation on completing A/C, I had 4 round of A/C and 12 of Taxol I just completed round #6 of taxol, everyone told me taxol is easier than A/C, but I have found that not to be the case. I had fatigue and loss of appetite on A/C but with taxol 2 days after treatment me I get achy all over, even my teeth hurt. My nails look horrible and are in the process of lifting off, my toe nails hurt. The nurses tell me it is the accumlative effect. They say since I get the treatment every week my body doesn't have time to catch up and recover, when I did A/C it was every other week. The good thing is the treatment doesn't take as long I am in and out in 3 hours. Good Luck betty",
