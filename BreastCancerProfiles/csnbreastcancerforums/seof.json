So far I have not felt the need to find or start a group to talk to face-to-face because of this site, and several survivors who are members of my church, but I think I would seek out such a group if I did not have the church support. I think someone to talk to about the emotions that go along with all the stuff you are going through would be good. If nothing else, you know that you are not the only one who has responses like yours. I had a double Mastectomy on 12/21/07, and I understand the impatience with the tight muscles and pain. It does get better! Best wishes, seof",

I had bilateral mastectomy, (left side was profilactic, had cancer in the right). I had 7 nodes removed and have had very little trouble with lymphedema so far (3 year post-op). The muscles in that underarm get tired/sore when I do more work than I am used to, and my right hand tends to tingle (like when your foot goes to sleep) when I lie down on that side too long, but that's all. The original mastectomy surgery was not too bad. I had tissue expanders in while I did chemo and radiation, then I chose reconstruction by the DIEP procedure. It is one that uses your own tissue. I had some unusual complications, so it took longer than the average to heal up, but now no one can tell I ever had the surgeries, even in a swimsuit. The biopsy was no big deal, and it was useful to help the Drs. pinpoint what kind of cancer I had to help them make a more informed treatement plan. I was very glad I had it done. Best of luck to you as you make your decisions. seof",

In case you do not know, a diaphragm is a flexible plastic/rubber disc with a stiffer rim that can be used with spermicide for about a 98% protection against pregnancy (f they are fitten and inserted properly). It can be inserted by a woman prior to sex, then removed afterward. They have been around many years. They have to be fitted by a gynocologist, and re-fitted if you gain or lose over 10-15 lbs, or after several months of use, but they have been safe and effective for many couples for many years (including myself and my husband before chemo-induced early menopause came to me). It is a bit inconvenient to have to insert it before you have sex, but no worse than a condom (I guess, never used condoms). Once you learn howto put it in it is like inserting a tampon for your period. Couldn't hurt to ask! Wishing you well, seof",

Bravery is not the absence of fear, but the determination to take action anyway. For me the best way to combat the fear is to educate myself as much as I can. Read, talk to your Doctors about anything and everything, and keep on asking questions till you are satisfied that you understand their answers. I have established pretty good communication with my Doctor now, but at first I felt like he probably thought I was thick-headed because I asked so many of the same questions over and over. If you feel like you can't get clear answers, be persistent, or consider changing Doctors. This website is a great place to get support and wisdom from those who have gone before. I ordered a book from the American Cancer Society called, \"A Breast Cancer Journey\" that I have found very helpful. Beyond that, I would say find people you trust and let them help you. I'll repeat what the others have said, take a notebook with you, and take a person with you who can help listen and help you remember what the Doctors say.

My definition of a cancer survivor is someone who has been diagnosed with cancer who is still alive. Being a survivor changes most people in permanent ways, both physically and psychologically.

I say why not get rid of the 10%? I had chemo, mastectomy, radiation, chemo, reconstruction. I am as cancer free as they can make me (NED). Until further notice, I claim wellness. There are no guarantees that cancer will not appear in some other part of the body, just as there are no guarantees that any person who does not have cancer will never get it. However, we can do the best we know how to do to reduce our chances and live as well as we can. Don't beat yourself up about feeling the way you do right now. Most of us have been there at least once along the cancer journey. Each person experiences the journey in his/her own way and time. I think you are smart to get involved in a support group. You will have face-to-face contact with folk who have been there/done that, and they will be there when and where you need them.

Nodes looked suspicious in ultrasound before chemo was started, and the tissue in the area is enlarged, so chances are good that they have been involved. chemo is shrinking everything, so we will see what happens. The main thing I would say in your case is that you should be persistent in expecting the Doctors to communicate clearly with each other and with you. If you are getting conflicting messages, it is that much harder to be confident in the treatment you recieve. Insist that they explain themselves to you until you understand and feel as comfortable as possible with the decision, or consider finding a team that works better together.

I did not have a reaction like that from chemo, but I did develop a slightly red, VERY ITCHY skin infection after surgery. I took benedril, put neosporin on it, and a round of antibiotics took care of it. You might ask the Dr. about that. Hope it can get cleared up soon. seof",

That does not mean I do not have my bad days, or that I do not yell and holler and scream sometimes because I am tired of having the possibility of recurrence in the back of my mind, I just do not allow myself to stay there. When I start to get down and discouraged about the daily struggle with cancer, I try to focus on the rest of my life that is not cancer. I have a great job, a loving husband, and 2 great daughters. I have other people around me I can focus on. I can call them and pray for them, I can help with a project at church, or at work...anything to get my mind off of me and do something more \"normal\" for a while. Hope this helps, seof",

I never used make-up much before chemo, but I learned ways to use it that I liked, and I kept on using it after the hair grew back.

As the Dr. or chemo nurses to be sure, but my own experience and many,many, many, posts that I have read lead me to think you should ead whatever goes down and stays down the best. I was one of the lucky ones that had very little stomach upset, so I could pretty much eat anything other than Mexican food or Indian food (my favorite \"out to eat\" categories). But some folks can barely keep down saltines and water, so nutrition can be a challenge. Hopefully your experience will be on the easy end of the spectrum.

Most make some comment indicating polite gratitude and mild interest, who knows what they do with the info later. One person said, \"OOh, I stay away from those cancer websites, books, and stuff.\" She may be one of those who prefers to handle things more internally and privately. As far as what kind of person I am: I am a Christian first. I am a spouse and a Mom, and I am a Speech Pathologist by nature and by profession. I say Speech Pathologist by nature because, as a group, we desire clear communication, often to a fault. I am people-oriented, and am fascinated with how people think and feel. I am methodical and like to \"mull it over\" before taking action. In the fable of the Tortoise and the Hare, I am the Tortoise, but I WILL get it done. I also believe knowledge is power. My artistic nature is in the area of words...I enjoy writing poetry and fiction. I like doing crafts with kids too. I like this discussion board because reading and writing give time for \"ruminating\" before responding. In face-to-face conversations it is harder to take the time for it.

      "Content": "Phoenix and Joyce, Let me preface what I am going to say with this: my intention is only to present another viewpoint, not to furhter annoy either of you. Now, Here's what I want to say: 1. I am one of those who take refuge in my faith in Jesus...\"faith is the evidence of things hoped for and the manifestation of things unseen\" according to the Bible. Therefore, if there is hope, it cannot be false. I will undoubtedly not make sense to you, but faith/hope/strength to me is an inexplicable and inescapable deep sense that it is and will be OK, even when what I see and feel should make me think otherwise. 2. Cancer has a mind of its own and is unpredictable. I am now and forever after a cancer survivor. Once treatments are done, Drs. may eventually pronounce me in remission, and there may or may not ever be evidence of cancer in my body in the future, but I will always define myself a cancer survivor and will always have the suspicious mindset...cancer cannot be trusted. I agree with both of you that it is not something that can be conquered...I think you have to learn to live with it at whatever stage you are at. 3. I go through an emotional buffet at least daily, if not weekly: optimism, pessimism, anger,fear, loneliness, frustration, determination to keep doing whatever it takes as long as it takes, desire to give up, desire to be independent and act as if none of it ever happened, desire to be cared for like a helpless invalid....I think all this is normal and OK. Today is a \"down\" day. I want to call the Drs. and call the whole thing off. Take the expanders out, cancel the appointment to start the next round of chemo, forget the radiation, just let me sit here and wallow in the mud. I want to do that, but I won't. Why not? a) the desire to wallow will pass b)I have a family who love me and to whom I am responsible to do my best to live as well as possible for as long as possible. That's all the rambling I'm going to do for now, thanks for listening. I wish you peace. seof",

I have been told that the most common side effects are fatigue and a sunburn-like effect on the skin. I have had none of it so far, but Doc. said it usually takes 4 weeks for the effects to be noticeable, then about 2 weeks after radiation stops before effects start to wear off. If the skin becomes very irritated, my Doc. says there is an aloe based cream that most women use, but I have not gotten it yet. They say most women don't have much pain or disability with radiation. I find the experience to be very similar to a CT scan. I lie down on the table and the machine circles around me while the technicians walk in and out of the room and the lights go on and off. The most difficult thing is being as still as possible. It doesn't take long (5 min. or so)so it is not bad. Yours may be different, ask your Doc. What questions to ask: How long will each session take? What is the start date and end date of treatments? Are there any activities you should avoid? What side effects should you expect? Are there patients who have been through it that you could talk to? That's what I can think of right now, hope it helps. seof",
