    "Content": "Hi Everybody, Thanks for all your support. Everything went very well today, I had the back room all to myself today. Had tv and the remote in hand, had all the judge shows going lol. I know that I snoozed alot off and on. They gave me the big boost of benadryl. So that knocked me out. Had the herceptin trmnt,along with the taxetere and paraplatin. Then after all that a shot in the arm for helping the blood count. But like I said everything went smooth. Had snaks, they fixed me some soup for lunch and had extra water. And they gave me a blanket that a former patient makes out of fleece to give to the new patients. It was really awesome.Now to see what the next few days bring. Talk to you all later Margo54",
