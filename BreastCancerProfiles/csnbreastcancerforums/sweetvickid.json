I now just look like a boy chest and where the nipple should be is a very fine scar. I have chosen not to do reconstruction. Again looked at a lot of pictures and researched options. I decided it was not worth all the surgeries and pain just to have to bumps up front. To me they don't look real and that kind of freaked me out. I am only 5 months out since my double mastectomy and usually don't even wear a bra with prosethesis. I am amazed at how many people don't even notice I have no boobs.",

Will be following up Tuesday before my first chemo with asking the Doc but don't have the patience to wait till then. : ) Did you have radiation treatment? I am trying to figure out a timeline. Right now I know I am doing 3 week X 4 cycles of Docetaxel And Bevacizumab by IV with Capecitabine bid. Then surgery. Thane finish up with 3 week X 4 of (A?C) doxorubicin/cyclophoshamide. They haven't said how much radiation. They keep saying I will be busy for the next year but will it really be all of 2010? Vicki",
