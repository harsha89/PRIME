      "Content": "Hi Marilyn, I wasn't told that anything was low or high, and I really do eat healthy, I even stopped drinking 2 yrs after Dx('91)but I can tell you I was still badly tired /exhausted at this point that you're at. I hesitate saying this, but, I really didn't feel back to \"normal\" until I hit my 5 yr mark. I did of course talk to my oncologist about it but.......iron pills and calcium and vitamin pills for women....were the same suggestions I got, they just didn't do the trick for me, I only wish they had. This is just what happened to be true for me. A couple of my family members may tell you I am still not normal, hehe! My baby was in nursery school \"93 and \"94(born in '90) from 9-2, I would do like 1 or 2 errands after dropping him off, come home right away and fall sound asleep on the family room couch. I would then have to drag myself up off it to pick him up by 2. This was not every day, but a lot of them. It was awful, mucho guilt for not really being there for him and mucho guilt over what was wrong with me. It just took me a long time to come back. I still don't know why, but it just did. I am so sorry you seem to be going through something similiar, but I believe it will pass for you, as it did from me. Just keep putting one foot in front of the other and if you can't, go to bed! Do what your body is telling you to do, if at all possible. I came to think of sleeping as healing time. I could only do 1 thing on the weekends, I learnt and stopped schdeduling 2 things for me. I will be praying for you as I do for all of us. Just try and give yourself permission to rest and sleep, A nice big (((((Hug))))) for you from me, Kathy",

I think it's so important to hear what someone said though, about purging and living the grief at whatever time or place it occurs. It is all about Time, and i guess I thought living around it as more time goes on is a helpful thought too. All I can say is I am so very sorry, my throat closed over as I read this. There is no greater loss. You and yours have my prayers. Love you and remember you can carry all of us in your pocket every day to try and make it easier. Kathy",
