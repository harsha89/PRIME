    "Content": "Hi I' ve been on Femara for almost 2 years I'm 45 and I also feel like 100 everyday for me is like a truck hits over and over again i wonder If I will ever be the energetic person that I used to be. Just tonight my daughter asked me why i havent been weeding the garden my reply to her was that I was too tired and she said .....but mommy you always say you are tired. I have been taking some vitamins lately but with no improvements that's not counting the weight i have gained so far. I am sorry that I couldnt be of any help but your post answered some of my questions.......I am not the only one feeling like this. Hugs and kisses your way Mariat.",
