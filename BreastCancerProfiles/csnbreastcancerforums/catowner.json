      "Content": "So glad about your results! I saw my oncologist yesterday and even though I was negative on the lymph nodes she still says I will need chemo. Whatever it takes I will do to eradicate this disease. My chemo starts the 13th of Oct for 16 months (8 treatments). I go today for a Petscan and next week for a heart test. So many appts!!!! Be sure and let me know what you find out, I will keep you in my prayers, Debbie",
