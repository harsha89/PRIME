If you are worried about going to Alanon in your own town you can go in a neighboring town. It is your husband's responsibility to do the job searching activities. The time you spent doing this should be spent on taking care of yourself. If this means getting a manicure, going swimming, to the gym or to an Alanon meeting it is important that you seperate your self from the problems that he needs to solve. He needs to solve the employment problem, and he needs solve the remaining sober issue.
