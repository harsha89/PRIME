      "Content": "Hi again, No you're not wrong at all. How can you be wrong about the handling of your own disease (hopefully not disease). When first diagnosed I felt like a failure because of the flipped out way I reacted. I compared myself to everyone's family member(people tell you their stories) who went through it so strong and courageous. I came to the conclusion that this is MY disease, MY body, and My trial of faith. God has allowed (not caused) this to come into my life for a purpose unique only to me. How you decide to handle every aspect is a very personal choice and you have the right. There;s enough pressure without others having expectations (for themselves) and getting angry with you when you don't satisfy their needs and wants. Hoping and praying it's all for not.",

      "Content": "I went to church last Sunday with pretty normal hair, only slightly thinner. I came home from church with itchy, loose feeling hair and began running my fingers through it. Three sink fulls later, I was almost bald! In ONE day??!! Needless to say, I was traumatized, but am slowly adjusting. The waiting was the worst I think. Day after day of counting the days and waiting til you're BALD can cause insanity!! :) I agree humor helps alot. I'm not quite ready for anyone elses humor though. Still too sensitive. Now I need all the tips on how to do this. What I find irritating already is that I have to have something on my head all day. I still have some hair, not much at all , but with even a scarf, it gets hot. I live in Tucson, Arizona...hot. My children who are still young don't want to see me without hair. Besides scarves, hats and a wig, are there any other clever ideas or tricks anyone has learned? Also, I'm very nervous about wearing a wig in public, feels so artificial. That's because it is! :)",

      "Content": "Hi all, Hope you're all doing well and hanging in there. I have a question for ya. I had a lumpectomy in Sept '11. I am still having tenderness at the incision site. It isn't anything I can't live with, but my mammogram is coming up and there's no way I could stand the pain of being squeezed that hard. Is this normal to have tenderness this far out? It hurts for me to apply pressure. Should I mention it to the docs?",
