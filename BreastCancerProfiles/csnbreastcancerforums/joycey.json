      "Content": "If you have very aggressive cancer then I would opt for chemo. Chemo increases your chance of survival by only a couple of percentage points if your cancer is not aggressive. The more aggressive the more the percentage points add up. The reason to be careful about chemo, it also can cause cetain other cancers later. such as adriamycin can in 10 years cause a certain kind of lieukemia. After all it is a poison. I had chemo but I also had very aggressive cancer. I would not have had it otherwise. Seek a second opinion. I wish the best for you.",
