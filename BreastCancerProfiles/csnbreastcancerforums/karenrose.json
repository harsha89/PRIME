    "Content": "Greetings! I'd like to develop some friends who have been through this interesting \"lump\" in life. One of those obstacles that is thrown ahead of you when you least expect it. I had a masectomy last Thursday (6-20) and healing nicely. I'm feeling GREAT, but soon I'll begin my fun regimine of chemo. I'd like to hear some insight on what that's been like for you. Were you able to work? Thanks! Karen Rose (roses1086@aol.com)",
