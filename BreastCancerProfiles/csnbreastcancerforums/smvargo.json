    "Content": "Hi Marysun, They took 19 of my nodes. I am just very aware of the behaviors that seem to worsen soreness. I do the stretches recommended and watch what I lift with my right arm. Repetitive activity, like sorting through piles of clothes for laundry is my nemesis. There is also a gentle kind of massage called \"lymphatics\" that was very helpful in relieving any minor swelling I have experienced. I have not had any problems so far, in fact my healing has been great. I am a guitar and bass player and don't want to lose that ability. My cat scratched me, pretty big scratch, and I went to my onc. to make sure there was no infection and that I wasn't a candidate for \"cat scratch fever.\" I kept singing the song and meowing, your treatment team deserves some entertainment. I was told never to hesitate to come in if I had a concern. I'm going to follow that advice. Just be aware, follow good medical advice, and you will be fine. Stephanie",
