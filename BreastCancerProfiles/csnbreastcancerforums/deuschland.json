    "Content": "Hope you continue to feel good. I had chemo almost 2 years ago. I had Adria and Cytoxan. I did loose my hair, but that did not bother me, not having hair did not change my spirit. I was fortunate, I only got sick from nausea one time, and that was the night after my 1st treatment. As time went on I got very tired. But I was not going to allow it to keep my down. I went on with my life as normal. The hardest part for me was knowing what to eat. Nothing ever sounded good to me and things that I used to love the thought of them made me feel nauseous. I hope you make it through this with minimal side effects. Best of luck to you! Ingrid",
