    "Content": "I would love to hear from anyone about the drug Femara. I had a bilateral mastectomy with tram flap reconstruction 7 weeks ago. My oncologist wants me to take Femara but I'm not so sure because of the side effects. My tumor was .7 so it was very small and I had areas of calcification cocerns in the other. I feel like I made a good but tough decision to do what I did and I don't want to do any more. My regular doctor said it is my choice and will support me either way. My husband wants me to take the drug but I don't think I want to. I'd love some advice!",
