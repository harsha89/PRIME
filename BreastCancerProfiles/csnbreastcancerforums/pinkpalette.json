      "Content": "Hi there fighting4five! I am Her2+ positive just like you and that is why the ONC is giving you Herceptin. My first treatment was Monday, this week, and I got the Herceptin right away. I will be getting it for 1 year. It was all so wierd the first chemo trip, but it really wasn't soooo bad. The onc. nurses are very patient and they give the first dosage very slowly and watch for reactions. I also received Taxotere and Carboplatin in my chemo regime. Everyone is different though. I had a 2cm. lump removed plus some additional tissue , then additional tissue removed - negative, then a lymph biopsy - negative, and then 4 lymph nodes removed - negative. I will also get radiation after the chemo - in 18 weeks. I put my trust in my doctors and surgeons to do what is best for me so this nasty cancer doesn't come back. I hope you find info and inspiration on this board. The pink sisters have helped me immensely and I know they will help you also. Good luck on your journey. Hugs, pinkpalette",

      "Content": "Welcome to the board, yet I am sorry to hear about your mom. Maybe I can answer some of your questions. It is not so uncommon, there are many women here who were Her2+ and are either currently undergoing treatment (like me) or have completed their treatment and are definitely surviving. The positive support of women on this board have been extremely helpful to me, and hope you will find the same. I was diagnosed with breast cancer this past spring. I had a lumpectomy and the 2 cm. lump was found to be Her2+, and ER/PR-. When I receive my chemo cocktail, I receive Herceptin (specifically targets the Her2+ cells) along with two other chemo drugs. I am scheduled to receive 6 cycles of chemo. I've only had one cycle and I am preparing to go this Monday for my second cycle. My chemo cycle is every 3 weeks. But I receive Herceptin every week. When my chemo cycle is over in 18 weeks, I will continue to receive Herceptin for a total of 1 year. It may seem complicated, but the oncologist will give you schedule. Of course your schedule may be different. I will also receive radiation treatment after the chemo cycle ends. Before I was able to start chemo, I had to go for an ecko-cardiogram to check my heart function and I am told I will need to do this periodically during my herceptin year. It was like a sonagram, painless, not a bid deal. My oncologist monitors me for any adverse side effects and will adjust the treatments if necessary. So far, I feel fine. It is absolutely do-able. Along with the chemo dose, I have received 3 doses of Herceptin and have not had any kind of noticable adverse side effects in any way. When I was diagnosed with breast cancer I was absolutely overwhelmed. At times I still am. I appreciate that there are targeted treatments for each woman. It is our best chance to beat this beast! I wish your Mom strength and hope on her journey.",

It's also great to hear about your minimal side effects too. I am preparing for my radiation treatments within the next few weeks, still have a round of chemo to go and I appreciate hearing that you got thru it pretty well. Having so many positive women on this site really makes me feel like I can do this. Heee heee, count me in belly-up to the bar for that drink (a small one). Enjoy yourself and the extra hours in your day. hugs, Debbie",

I take the 3mg. dose - it disolves and tastes like grape - and within 15 to 30 minutes I have deep restful sleep. Once in a while, I do wind up waking up again...but I blame it on the chemo and steroids. Best wishes to you having a good nights sleep, dear! Hugs, Debbie",
