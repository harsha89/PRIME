    "Content": "I would like imput from anyone who's had DIEP as I am considering it. Diagnosed with Breast Cancer in Aug. 2007. Bilateral mastectomy in Sept 2007. Finished Chemo in Dec. 2007. Had Saline implants in June of 2008. By July 1, 2008 had emergency surgery to remove implants because of infection. Not going there again. Now I'm considering DIEP. Any firsthand knowledge would be welcome",
