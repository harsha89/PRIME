      "Content": "as far as the rawness....my doctor had to treat me for a bacterial vaginal AND bacterial uti...almost immediate relief..ahhhhh, a pill, and a gel to insert. Seems like i'm prone to them still if i'm given an antibiotic, but at least i know what it is and get help for it as soon as i feel the first symptom. Re: the constipation, i tried everything in the book...the only thing that helped me was to stew some prunes, and the trick was to eat them warm...yep...warm. That did it. Good luck!!! and this too shall end!",

We have a day...ok, maybe more than a few days, where we just need support, shoulders, and someone else to carry us for awhile...and then the tides turn, and we are out there on the front lines doing the same for someone else. I,personally, have not noticed your posts being negative...honesty is what i count on here. I love having a man on here that can give a different perspective. No apologies...sheese!!! not here.... ok??? jeanne",

      "Content": "My nameis Jeanne, which matched another member on this board, so i didn't use it as my user name so it wouldn't cause confusion. This subject is possibly the hardest part of what i've been going through with the treatments and everything. My sister, we are not close at all, when she was told of my diagnosis by my mom via email, her response was....well, that's great news for you and me, huh mom?....um, what???? I have ONE more chemo treatment to go, and i feel as if i have become Old News. I had chemo this last friday, and one person called to see how i was. I live alone, and it is very hard dealing with the ups, downs, pain, etc., while living alone, as i'm sure some of you know. Even my mom \"texted\" me to see how i was doing. ????? I'm hurt...i have another friend who i have considered a sister for over a decade actually tell me that she just has to live in denial because she can't handle the fact that i have this disease...again....what???? I have found out who my real friends are, which was narrowed down to basically 2, and the rest....well, i'm afraid that permenant damage has been done. I am getting rid of all negativity in my life, and looking out for me first, for the very first time in my life. Am i resentful...**** yes....and i working on letting the resentment go? Of course, but the pain is quite real.",

      "Content": "I took an anti anxiety med prior to my chemo treatments, i think they really helped, and i also looked like i was going away for the weekend with my rolling pack that i took with me. I packed popscicles that i sucked on one after the other as they hand pushed in the first drug...must have worked, i never got even one mouth sore...then i packed both sugary and salty snacks..and ALWAYS made myself drink 2qts of liquid during chemo. The salty snacks helped with that because they made me thirsty. I took suduko books (which were hysterical to try and do because i did get very sleepy), the first time i took a mini dvd player with ear plugs to watch a movie, but slept through most of it, and taking your own blanket is a WONDERFUL idea!! The best of luck to you....also, sleep sleep sleep as much as you need to. Sometimes afterwards you just need to sleep from the tension let down...just do it! take care of yourself, let us know how you do! jeanne",

      "Content": "why do i feel so crappy? tomorrow is the first every-other-friday, that i'm not having my chemo....i am done...officially done two weeks tomorrow. But in some ways i feel worse....or as bad. My fatigue seems to be worse....i either can't sleep at all, or i can fall into such a deep sleep in the middle of the day, that the phone that is right next to my head, literally next to my head on the bed, doesn't wake me up. At work, my eyes roll around in my head during meetings to the point it's embarrassing. I laid my head down on my desk at lunch to \"rest\", and woke up over an hour later, with a perfect red hand print across half of my face...and i had to go to the bathroom so bad, that i had to pretend i was scratcing my ear to cover up the mark on my face just to walk to the bathroom! lol i guess you just gotta laugh...but i didn't anticipate the fatigue being worse...did the chemo build up and is now kicking my butt? The chemo brain, which was \"ha ha, there's the chemo brain agan!\"...is now....ok....i can't remember where i parked my car and can't get home from work until i find it (city streets, not a lot). I know that our hormones are going nutty....i haven't had a period since my first treatment in february. But gee whiz! come on!! my favorite phrase has become...\"you know what...this is just sh*tty\"",
