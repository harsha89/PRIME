      "Content": "Before you start radiation, you'll be positioned and marked so the technicians can align your body the exact same way every time you're treated. Make sure the technicians tell you every area that will be targeted by the radiation beams. I wasn't aware that my collarbone was one of the target areas and I didn't moisturize there. As a result, I have a dark, burn spot on my collarbone that I hear takes years to fade away.  Your radiation oncologist or her NP will tell about moisturizers and how to keep your skin healthy, but you still may have problems. Best wishes.",

      "Content": "My weight stayed the same at the end of treatment, but I had increased in inches. Especially around my waist. I figured that came from lack of exercise and I heard that the steroids made you lose muscle tone.  I've lost 22 pounds since, but it's from diligently watching (and writing down) everything I eat. So I include a thinner me with short-short hair as part of my new normal. Best wishes.",

I can't say I had a rash and it didn't extend to the rest of my body.  Everybody's experience is different.",
