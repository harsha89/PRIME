    "Content": "Heather, Thanks for your chemo update. Sounds like you are doing well. My thoughts and prayers are for you and your mom. I realize I have more strength than I knew I had and try to keep a positive attitude. All you can do is be the best \"you\" for your mom. Tomorrow, I start my first chemo. I have been drinking lots of fluids and tried this combo for nausea that was in another thread on this site. (hot water, chunk of fresh peeled ginger and a slice of lemon). I added 1/2 of this mixture to a glass of regular water. Unfortunately, I had 6 surgeries and an infection with the tram flap which did not take due to an infection. So I have been on Femara for over 2 months and 2 1/2 months on two different types of antibiotics until the end of November. So I have been experiencing some of the expected side effects already. Maybe that is a sign that the chemo will not be so bad. lol - can only hope. Best of luck to everyone and especially the August chemo sista's. Take care. Laurel",
