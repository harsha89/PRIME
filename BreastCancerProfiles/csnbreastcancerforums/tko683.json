    "Content": "I had the same thing happen to me. Definately tell your doctor. I was on tamoxifen at the time so everytime I would have any bleeding my doctor wanted to do a D&C. It went on for over a year and then stopped and started again when they switched me to arimidex. Then they added a montly Lupron shot which stopped the bleeding for now. I am 52 years old and was 44 when diagnosed.",
