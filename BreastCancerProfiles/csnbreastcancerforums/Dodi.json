      "Content": "Hi Bunnie, For me, my hair had always grown real fast before I had chemo. It has not changed. I finished my chemo last October, and today my hair is probably 3 or 4 inches long, and very curly. I have never had curly hair (unless of course I paid for it) It grows faster than you think. I hope you are doing well. Take care",

      "Content": "Dear Sweet onion, Getting a breast cancer diagnosis was the scariest thing I have ever encountered. I, as a young girl saw my grandmother die of cancer, and remember hearing my older siblings talking about how it was actually the chemo that killed her. When faced with the decision as to have chemo or not, I had called my older sister who is an RN. She told me that if it was her, and they offered to ignite a bomb off inside her to get rid of it she would do it.So I did it. I was so afraid, and even more so when i saw how the nurses handled this drug. I think I cried everytime I had a treatment. I was surprised at how well they are able to treat the side effects. I really was never very sick. The worst part of it all was losing my hair. I had real long hair, and had decided to get it cut short before it started falling out, thinking that would make it easier...Well, it didn't. I still cried. But I finished my last chemo treatment 6 months ago, and my hair is already 3-4 inches long, and very curly! Never had curly hair before. I am soo glad that I opted to fight this with everything I could. I have no regrets. Should it ever come back, it will because it did, and not because I didn't do everything I could to stop it. My best to you. You will be fine.",
