    "Content": "Do you have a \"Look Good Feel Better\" program in your area? That was a huge help for me. The cosmetologist showed us lots of tips on the eyelash problem. There's a drug available now for growing eyelashes! I've seen it advertised and my surgeon has brochures in the waiting room. (It's not for chemo-related eyelash loss - they'll grow back after treatment.) I don't plan to try it, but I thought it was interesting and kind of funny - I'd love to see the drug company's proposal for that research. I probably would take a drug to avoid having to shave my legs - That was the one good thing about chemo. (And yes, I lost my \"private\" hair during TC chemo but now it's growing back like I was 20 instead of 49.)",
