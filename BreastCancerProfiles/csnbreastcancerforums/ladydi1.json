Don't apologize, we all have our days. Sometimes I want to just punch a clown or tear up a million phonebooks in frustration. Hang in there, you have support here and you can count on that! LadyDi1",

We cannot stop someone from killing themselves, they are in a dark place nothing can reach. Please surround yourself with friends and loved ones now and talk to someone on the support line. Hugs and Prayers, ladydi1",
