    "Content": "There is research on the benefits of fasting while going through chemo.  I would paste links, but can't seem to do it from my iPad. If interested, just google \"chemo and fasting\".  i had my first chemo last week and I fasted for a total of 67 hours.  I would be interested in hearing from anyone who has tried this. jan",
