      "Content": "Hi Lisa. I am not a regular poster here, usually on the uterine and ovarian cancer boards. I wanted to suggest that you visit the Ovarian board and ask over there, pretty sure several ladies have been on Gemzar. Also, I remember reading some possible side effects of Gemzar are swelling or tightening of throat and chest. Good luck to you!",

      "Content": "Yes there have been some studies suggesting antiperspirant is a culprit.. the theory being that it blocks underarm sweating and excreting of toxins...it's never been proven just like the too tight bra/underwire theory, cell phone/brain cancer, autism/vaccine links and so on and so on. But why tempt fate I guess... I use a deodorant, I do not use antiperspirant... it's hard sometimes to find just deodorant.. everything is both combined , that's why I usually go to a man's deodorant.. it's easier to find just a deodorant for men....and you can get something unscented if you prefer. It's hard not to become paranoid nowadays esp with all the conflicting studies.",
