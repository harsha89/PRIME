    "Content": "Was also recently diagnosed with stage 0 breast cancer and am scheduled for a double mas in a few weeks.  My problem is deciding on what type of reconstruction to have. So much information that I'm overwhelmed.  Spoke w/my plastic surgeon about both implants and Tram procedures.  I'd like to get first hand info from women who have undergone the procedures.  Am at the point where I really have no idea what to do.  Help!",
