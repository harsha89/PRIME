      "Content": "Hello everyone, I have been reading the boards for a few months now and periodically I have noticed tips and tricks to relieve or alleviate pain from chemo. and Neulasta shots. I remember a mention of Clariton and Tylenol but don't remember for what. I am starting chemo. this Wednesday the 19th and am terrified I am going to bolt out of the chair. If anyone has any tips I can jot down ahead of time I would soooo appreciate it. Maybe I will feel better if I am more prepared. Thanks everyone!! Oh, by the way it will be Taxotere and Cycotan (spelling??).",

For someone who makes a game out of finding her Christmas gifts before the actual day this is extremely difficult (my husband does not like this game :-) - but I will do it. Thank you to my ornament angel ahead of time!",
