    "Content": "I have just completed my fourth round of Taxotere. Side affects for me were sour stomach which i take famotidine 20mg (pepcid), foods such as vegetables acidy fruits taste like metal also spicy foods taste like metal. This has lasted up to 10 days after treatment. the nausa lasts for 3 days. The fatigue was the worst for me. It hit me hard day 3 which I would end up in bed for 24-36 hours. The good news is it leaves as fast as it comes. I keep plenty of Vanilla Ensure with protein, Vanilla Ice Cream,Eggs, Whole Milk, Instant Breakfast to make milk shakes. Jello and crackers are good to keep.My question to you is, I am going to start Adriamycin, 4rounds every 3 weeks. How bad are the side affects??????",
