    "Content": "Hello, I also have lots of joint pain. I finished treatment 4 months ago, started to work out again but that has not helped. Taking Armidex for the next 5 years, not happy about that but not much of a choice. Have not talked to my doctor yet about this because I have no plans to take any other meds to help. I have also heard it could last forever... sorry to say..Good luck... Ann",
