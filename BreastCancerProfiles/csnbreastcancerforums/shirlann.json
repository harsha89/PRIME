We are never \"cured\", but after having toenail cancer, hair cancer and elbow cancer, I still get squirelly when I have any pain or ache. I hate it. God bless you, you are not alone! Hugs & Kisses, Shirlann (PS, However, if you survive 5 years, 80% of us will NOT have any more trouble)",

Recurrence is a damn nuisance but your life expectancy is no worse than the origninal diagnosis. Mets are another matter. So, if it is recurrence, just hang in there, life will straighten out and be fine. Your original cancer must have been a very slow grower, good news. God love you, hugs, Shirlann",

I know that all will be well and as we all know, if the cancer does recurr, other than a blasted nuisance, you are no worse off in life expectancy than you were at first diagnosis, it just means they did not get all the cells. No big deal (except to us). We are all here for you and I will pray mightily for you tonight. God bless you, Hugs, your sister, Shirlann",

They are all over the states now and cost a bit, but tell a whole lot with little or no discomfort. ALso, you are likely to have colitis if you have been stressing over all the rest! Perfectly understandable. BUT, when you feel better and get time in hand you will not have to deal with colitis forever, when the stress of the \"other\" gets better it could easily go away. Bless your heart, sometimes it is so much to take. Good news is, they can usually find cancer recurrence easily, so it looks like you have something else, also good news, it is not fatal, just miserable, like a cold. Hang on, honey we are all praying for you! Shirlann P.S. If you are not on any vitamins, get on \"C\", \"E\", and a big fat \"B\" complex. You will feel better!",

      "Content": "Hi, Jayne, I will hold positive thoughts that the liver thing is nothing. So many things look like something and are not. I am 67 and have also battled and lost 20 times the weight game. I go again to Weight Watchers, it is the cheapest and I like it because it allows you to eat at fast food places. All the restaurants (main ones) are listed in a book you buy and you can choose things that work. Now, I am going back on Wednesday, if you want, call your local chapter, join with a credit card, and start with me. We can do it together. They use a point system that seems a little confusing at first, but is really easy. You journal each day and I lost 22 pounds in 6 months the last time around. Then my oldest son had a heart attack and I felt if I gained weight it would help him! Sigh, so if you want to do this, it is the cheapest system, you eat your own food, and it also is slow, but we must be careful not to crash diet, that is not good for our immune systems. so slow and steady is what we are after. I'm on Paxil and that has not helped my weight at all. Love you dear sister, Gentle hugs, shirlann",

My mom's best friend is 47 years post double mastectomy, she is 92 and doing fine, Remember, Betty Ford and Happy Rockefeller BOTH, President's wife & Vice-Presidents's wives had breast cancer 35 years ago. Betty is now well into her 80's. That was just not true information. Get Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book on line at Borders.com or Amazon.com and you will see many great info spots for us. If you go 5 years, you have an 80% chance of NO recurrence or metastases. Whoever told you that info was dead wrong. Hugs ans kisses from your sister, Shirlann",

It is an inflammation of the lining between the ribs and the chest wall and is a side effect of radiation. I am 3 yrs 5 mths post and no one ever told me. Sometimes when I twist sharply the pain just takes my breath away. I too, have many aches and pains I never had before. I am so happy you have found a solution to a lot of the \"aches\". I think there is a lot more happening to us with treatment than anyone wants to admit. But maybe that is okay, we would have all said \"NO\". ha ha, Hugs and kisses from your sister, Shirlann",

      "Content": "Hi, darling Tara, you are right! You do not have to put up with pain! If you do not get help from the docs you are with, go to a pain center. This is rediculous. I used to copy records in hospitals and docs offices for car accidents, did this for 13 years, I'll never forget the day I heard one doc say to another, \"I hope my two cancer patients die soon, I have 4 more that are terminal and if they have to have morphine I can either give it to them and face the state board of inquiry or not give it to them\"> I was shocked. In California you can buy anything you want under the bridges, but cancer patients can't get what they need because docs are closely monitored as to how much \"listed substances\" they can prescribe! This is the silliest thing I have ever heard of, but I know it is an ugly little secret. God bless you, hugs & kisses, SHirlann",
