    "Content": "I had one of those old cassette tape players & went to the library & got \"books on tape\", which seem to be plentiful. I would get all cozy & put on my headphones & next thing I knew, I was being shook by the nurse to tell me I was finished & it was time to clean up my port. I don't think I ever got through with one side of the cassette or finished a book, but I always had a nice nap.",
