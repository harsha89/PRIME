    "Content": "I went to my Gyno on Monday for my yearly & to tell him I had an issue with my left breast.. My nipple had inverted & breast has hardened. He looked at it said nothing & sent me to a breast specialist. I saw her on Weds - yesterday. Within 10 mins of being in the office she said she was very concerned that it is cancer while she was doing an ultra sound. Had me get a mammogram right then & scheduled me for a ultrasound biopsy on friday.. WOW what a whirlwind & I am so frightened about what is going to happen now. I just found this board & wanted to tell someone besides my husband. I have 2 beautiful daughters & 2 Beautiful step daughters & dont know how to let them know what is going on...At what point do you start telling family & friends that this is happening to you?? Thanks for any and all advice, prayers, good thoughts SUPPORT!!",
