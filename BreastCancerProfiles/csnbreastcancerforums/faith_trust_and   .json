Let's not neglect to consider those Neanderthals that watch the game and get involved in riots. Rugby, there's a man's sport, men holding the ball and running at the same time! No time to writhe about faking an injury. I, for one, will be quite happy when all this silliness is over.",

I understand radiation won't effect it, so my radiologist claims. I need to get 'Ye Olde Port\" flushed next week anyway and thought I'd ask the hematologist. I was running a slight temperature yesterday with body aches and it dawned on me that sometimes it might not be side effects, but an old fashioned bug. I took two Tylenol PMs hit the sheets for about 11 hours and felt much improved this morning....but still I am wondering... Any anecdotes, opinions, statistics, or really scary flu stories to share?",

I leave my prosthesis in the pocket and place the entire cup back in the form after use. I wash the brassiere by hand once a week, and when I'm off I just wear a sports bra and oversized sweatshirts to keep my real girl in place. Bubbles doesn't droop quite like I do, so I don't wear sweaters like I once did. Lucky you, looking good and fuller! Maybe if you put the forms side by side and rest the brassiere in them (nipples down) you can avoid twice the struggle that I know I was dealing with....not to mention getting them back in place in the morning. Best wishes.",

Too, I followed instructions about the consumption of antioxidants and only used Tom's deodorant as I was warned that other products might have a aluminum chlorohydrate which could interfer with the administration of the radiation.   I can honestly say that my fair, almost bluish complexion, did not burn and my radiated skin is as supple as the non-radiated.   ",

I find myself now, having completed the chemo, dwelling less on details and simply tuning back into my life. I'm going to do the radiation early in the day and make plans for the remainder of each, treating myself to lunch, a movie, maybe a pedicure, or just window shopping. My radiation center has already encouraged me to take advantage of their free weekly massages and they have my 'playlist'. Radiation is looking a damn sight better than the chemotherapy. I have my creams and deodorant recommended by the center and I will meet yet another new set of friends as I visit over the next couple of months. As for the commute...hmmm, I do an hour each way each day when I am working. I have grown to think of my commute time as my special alone time. When I became a mom that was lost, even the bathroom wasn't sacred! I have time for uninterrupted thoughts, extended prayers, and sometimes wailing alone in my car.

      "Content": "As you will find whilst reading these boards the chemo-savvy ladies all react differently. I am a 54 year old regular education classroom teacher with 30 gifted and demanding students. After my 7 weeks off for tests and surgery, I only took every third Friday off for my chemotherapy and was back to my 1 hour commute each way the following Monday. The week immediately following chemo was tough. I kept ginger ale at my desk and sipped it if necessary to suppress any uneasiness I might get. I was beat, but I could function. I did not wear a mask or worry about being around little kids with my compromised immune system. I needed my routine and to maintain some level of normalcy. For me, the side effects lessened as I came closer to completing chemotherapy and I was tuned into my body. I simply wasn't going to allow myself to be taken out of the game! Of course, when I got I home I hit the sheets. I am in radiation now, and will not complete this phase of treatment until after the academic school year begins...sometime around Back-to-School Night if my calculations are correct. Historically I have used sick days to avoid those pre-school staff development days *wink*, but this year I think I will save the days for doctor's appointments and in the event I am actually ill. My advice is listen to your body. I would not say that radiation has exacerbated my fatigue, and I am fatigued. I think I am simply tired of this whole process and for me time off would have meant too much time to dwell introspectively which would likely result with \"Woe is me\" or a pity party as some prefer to call it. It's an individual decision and I pray that no matter what you decide, that you find comfort.",
