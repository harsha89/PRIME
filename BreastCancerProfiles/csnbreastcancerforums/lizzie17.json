And for me, I had what I called \"nausea attacks\".  They would  come on suddenly, and when I could just go to sleep and let them pass, I would.  They usually happened in the evening or during the night, so for me, my oncologist had me take Arimidex in the morning. I was always tired and kept working (teacher) but came home and pretty much could do nothing.  I have adult daughters and I think they never understood that part. But, I kept smiling and was grateful. I still am.   My thought, go ahead and try what the doctor wants you to.  I won't say it is easy, but for me it was doable. Sending you prayers.      ",
