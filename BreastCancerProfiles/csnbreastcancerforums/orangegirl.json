    "Content": "Tara, I just passed 14 years and was edging up on 15 when I had the worst dejavu ever. I had a call back on my annual mam and sure enough, there's a new mass. I am right where you are - the anxiety and depression are fueled by the doctors and techs saying the stupidest things. Can no one read a chart? Can't they see I've already done this once and have a little more compassion and for pete's sake, stop talking down to me. Even if this mass is benign, the emotional toll is considerable. I have severe lymphedema in my left arm (same side as original lump) and I took a serious tumble a few months ago. I'm not sure if any of this is related - I had been in a car accident 15 years ago and the area of my breast compressed by the seat belt is the precise spot where my first tumor was located. Of course, none of my oncology team thought that was in the slightest bit significant. 6 months ago I had a mystery infection in my lyphedemic arm that has left me with limited mobility in my elbow which is what led to a fall down a flight of stairs 2 months ago. Now I have a new mass that shows up on the same side. I have tried not to worry - the worry isn't going to make anything better. But I know what you mean - I could I have done better, been more careful, and maybe I missed something. The uncertainty is the worst part right now and I would give anything for a burst forward in time so I could know. If I have to do this again, then I'll do it but I'd like to know so I can prepare. Tara, I wish you the very best and know that you can reach out your hand and find mine any time. E",
