    "Content": "I think cancer is sometimes harder on the loved ones who watch us go though the \"fight\".I too have young daughters. And sometimes they have to remind me to stay strong. If you were not told by drs. make sure your wife wears a night mask or tape shut her weak eye. It will keep it from drying out. Dry eye is a pain to deal with on top of every thing else. God bless and your in my prayers.",
