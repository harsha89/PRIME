    "Content": "Sasu, yes, the chemo center administers pre-meds prior to the infusion. One time they didn't when introducing a new medication which usually has no side effects. That wasn't a good idea! Side effects hit full blast while in the chair and the meds had to be stopped while other meds were quickly introduced to counter the negative effects. If the pre-meds do not work, with this med, it will be abandoned and there are no other options for this particular problem. Good to hear your experiences.  Your positive attitude is projected.  ",
