    "Content": "I stopped taking Tamoxifen 2 years ago. I took it for 6 years with little side effects, cramps in my hands and legs, hot and cold flashes. Those I did have could be from age..... I am now 52 and an eight year survivor. After going through a bone marrow transplant everything else doesn't seem that bad. But then everyone has different degrees of side affects and I hope you are feeling better by the time you get this message. God's speed. June",
