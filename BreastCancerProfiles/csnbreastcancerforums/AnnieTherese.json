      "Content": "Since my mastectomy in January 2011, I find I notice other womens boobs all the time. I know I'm just jealous. :-) I think....hold on to them as long as you can girl and take good care of them, you just don't know when you might lose them. LOL Although I've always been a very modest person in my dress, I've never tried to show cleavage, I still miss the one I've lost, even though it was a bit old and saggy. :-) I've started reconstruction but it'll never be the same as we all know. We can try and make ourselves look and feel the same as before, but of course it'll always really just be wishful thinking !! Cheers, Annie :-)",

      "Content": "I don't know if I should ask this question...but I will anyway... Do you have a bucket list ??? One of the things on mine was... Drive a red Mercedes sports car...must be an early 1960s model, red with white interior, and of course have the top down. :-) I'd want it for half a day so I could drive up along our local coast. I've only had one bout of cancer and there's nothing wrong with me now. But if the cancer ever returns, before I get really sick, that's one of the things I'd like to do. I tried to think of all sorts of things, but couldn't really think of much because I've travelled overseas and within my own country, so I'm happy with the places I've been. I'd like to go into a jewellery shop and try on their most expensive diamond ring. :-) That would be fun. :-) Apart from that I'd really like to visit one of my brothers who lives in another state from me, and my son, he also lives in another state. I'd like to sit on a beach with my husband and watch a sunset over the ocean, and have a picnic on a couple of the parks near where I live. There are just a few little things in my local area that I'd like to do while I'm still well. What are your thoughts...or don't you think about such things.... Cheers, Annie",
