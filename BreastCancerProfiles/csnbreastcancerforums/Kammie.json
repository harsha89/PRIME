    "Content": "I was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 49. This was several months after my ex-husband was diagnosed with cancer in his jaw. He is 10 years younger then me. For my little 11 year old son to have both parents with cancer at the same time seemed against the odds to me. So, my mind cant help but wonder back to things we might have been exposed to, but I have no answers. I can only be thankful that so far we are both doing well and starting to recover from the exhausting effects of chemotherapy.",
