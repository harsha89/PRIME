      "Content": "I had mastectomy on left side, with immediate tram flap reconstruction in January 2003. Throughout my recovery, I had excellent range of motion, never had any problems at all. Went through AC Chemo from March to May 2003. during surgey, had only 2 lymph nodes removed (negative). I haven't had any indication of lymphedema (to date), or any arm problems AT ALL! But, two weeks ago, I came down with pneumonia. The coughing fits caused a stiff neck (maybe pinched nerve or something; or possibly just that the pneumonia went into my neck/upper back/shoulder -- the doctor isn't sure, but thinks it will resolve itself once the pneumonia is gone). Anyway, for about a week, the shoulder/upperback/neck on the left side (my surgery side) was in excruciating pain. Since being on antibiotics and cough syrup with codeine, I'm starting to feel better, and the pain in the shoulder is getting better. I keep heat on it in the evenings, and try to do my \"normal\" routine during the day. But, now, I'm finding that my shoulder is stiff and lifting my arm is difficult. Getting dressed, shampooing hair, reaching into the cupboard, etc. is hard. It feels like my arm is dead. There is some tingling in the fingers, especially when I'm typing. I still notice some neck pain (it feels pinched) and stiffness in turning my head. Anyway, I'm wondering if any of you have had a \"frozen shoulder\" and what did it feel like? I may have to reschedule another appointment with my doctor to get to the bottom of this. She was more concerned about the pneumonia when I saw her last week than she was about the shoulder/neck. I'm trying hard to keep the muscles limber and to move my shoulder/arm as much as possible -- doing all those range of motion exercises I did following surgery. It wasn't even hard to do them then...but, it is now. Any help or advice would be appreciated. Thanks.",

      "Content": "My bc was in left breast, had mastectomy and tram flap reconstruction last January 2003. Am now on Tamoxifen, following AC Chemo from March to May of 2003. Severe joint pain until about November, when it settled down some. Still get periods of joint pain every now and then. Lately, however, I seem to have developed a severe muscle (I think) spasm in my RIGHT shoulder blade area. I don't remember any injury or anything. But, when the spasm hits (when I sit down, it sometimes flares, or when I lay down; and sometimes, just walking and standing), I can hardly breathe because of the shooting pain. Has anyone else experienced something like this, and what did you do about it? I see my oncologist next week, so will definitely tell her about it. I'm just still in the \"worry about every little pain\" stage of this adventure...so, I'm a bit concerned. If anyone has any experience with muscle spasms in shoulders, and has some advice...I'm hoping to hear from you! Thanks heaps! Off to put a little heat on my shoulder... ~Barb",
