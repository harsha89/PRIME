      "Content": "I know our Tiger won't be roaring here any more; but I do know she is now singing with the angels; and knowing her she is probably leading them on a march all around God's heaven. If we love her and respect her memory - then like Pam says - we must take up her banner and fight the good fight. This is no time for quitting or giving up - Rosa would have a fit if you do that. Where there is life there is hope for more life, but when God says 'enough' then no matter who you are or where you are - you will obey. Praise His holy name that Rosa knew what it took to get to Heaven. \"Thank you God for our friend, my life is enriched for having known her!\" Amen May God bless each of you and give you His strength and comfort. Love and hugs and prayers, Brenda",

      "Content": "Dear Wendy: My oncology nurse once told me that she thought it was my faith in God that was keeping me strong and as well as I am. I thank Him everyday for ALL my blessings - so many I loose count. I try not to ever complain about what I don't have; but be ever so grateful for all that I do have. I read somewhere that we should never put a question mark where God has put a period. We must just trust and obey. You keep that faith of yours going strong. Sometimes His answer is 'no' but he gives us so much, we shouldn't ever be downcast. May God continue to bless you and your family. You are in my thoughts and prayers. Hugs and love, Brenda",

If anyone is interested in an article on research into 'chemobrain', try out the website for CURE magazine that the CSN Community Manager has given in the latest e-mail (home messages)notification. I found it most interesting that enough women have complained until actural research has started. I hope this day finds each of you feeling better. You are all in my thoughts and prayers.

      "Content": "Dear Jayne: I know personally the hand you are holding, because it is the same one I hold to dearly. I don't know much about the liver except there can be a multitude of problems that are not fatal! After all several of the spots on mine turned out to be cysts rather than tumors. The chemo destroyed the tumors but didn't touch the cysts. My doctor says most folks in my age group might have one and never know it because they are harmless. It takes a specialist to identify these problems. You will probably be told to cut out as much red meat as possible and be careful about any drugs you might be taking that could interfere with the liver. The cholesterol drugs sometimes can damage the liver. A wise lady told me the best way to loose weight was to limit the number of times I bend my elbow each day! You will be in my prayers - let us know what you find out. Love and hugs, Brenda",

I have saved each card that friends have sent and like to reread those that were most healing to my heart! I'll share one with a Helen Steiner Rice poem (she's good): \"I Meet God in the Morning\" I meet God in the morning and go with Him through the day, Then in the stillness of the night before sleep comes I pray That God will just take over all the problems I couldn't solve, and in the peacefulness of sleep my cries will all dissolve... So when I open up my eyes to greet another day, I'll find myself renewed in strength and there will open up a way To meet what seemed impossible for me to solve alone, and once again I'll be assured I AM NEVER ON MY OWN. Wishing all of you a sound sleep, and a restful day warmed by the light of God's love. Hugs from Brenda (GA)",

      "Content": "Dear Jean: I had 6 infusions of Taxotere and it caused all kinds of problems--I was very sick, but when changed to TAxol - I did much better--even though it usually works just opposite. So, no one knows exactly how they will react, because every one is different. Chemo hits fast dividing cells even though they are healthy,(chemo cannot tell the difference--it just attacks all fast dividing cells); and from the eyes all the way through the body & around the vulva-- all this area is made up of soft tissues(which are fast dividing cells) and are affected adversly by the chemo. I had cold symptoms for months just due to chemo--then nose would dry out and bleed!! Good luck and God Bless. Brenda",

People range in age all over the place here - some have babies of their own - others have grandbabies. The cancers range from Stage I through Stage IV. So any advice you need or would like to share will be welcomed. I don't believe this site has been on line very long, so we are all still close in our treatments. It has been a year for me and several others I know of; so feel free to 'jump right in'. We are all in this fight together, and must support each other as best as we know how. God bless you. Brenda",

      "Content": "You did not say how much you already know about a port-a-cath. Like the name implies -it is a semi-permanent access to a main vein (it can be removed when no longer needed). It goes right under the skin with a short catheter in your vein. Mine is about the size of a nickle and the shape is very obvious under my skin. Mine is right below my left collar bone. Usually you are not put all the way under (anethesia) but are aware of what is going on. I was ready to go home probably in about two to three hours from time I got to Outpatient clinic. I had bruising and was sore in shoulders for a couple of days, but after that I hardly notice it. When you go for chemo, the nurse will sterilize the spot thoroughly with about 5 swabs of alcohol and betadine. The needle is shaped kinda like the number 7 only with a straight top and they stick the top side straight into port (it has opening under the skin). It stings a bit, but nothing like needle going into vein on hand or arm. The tubing to IV is connected to needle and then the chemo just drips right in. After you are through, they take out needle and put a gauze pad over area and tape it down. You can take it off by the time you get home. Like Carrie said, it is the best thing I have done for myself to help with all my IVs. Let us hear how it goes for you. Hoping for the best for you. God bless you. Brenda",
