    "Content": "I am sure you are giving it a good thought on whether or not to do chemo. I think, if it were me deciding not to do chemo, I would do my utmost research on what I could eat, drink, what vitiamins tea etc in order to stay cancer free or kill the cancer cells if there are still some in your body. I have heard many stories of people with cancer going to mexico and doing a natural cure. I actualy met a guy whose mother and sister both went there and came back healed. I dont know what kind of a diet they were given. So maybe some books on what to do naturaly. I would really like for you to do what ever is necessary to stay cancer free. I did chemo, but my case was different, I had a breast tumor and lymph nodes with cancer so I did chemo immediatly. Mine was pretty advanced and did chemo for six months. Got through it! Do not let money stop you from choosing chemo. They have funds available, I would be more than happy to do some research to help you on that. Plus the hospital provides help. So please you can not put a price on your life and health. It is terrible to lose your hair, no doubt! It grows back and nice. That should not stand in your way, its very temporary and you can do it. Again if your choice is not to do it becuase of the poisons in chemo then do more research and ask questions on this Breast cancer site and other cancer sites listed here. Some women have talked about books with great diets to be on that work. I do hate what is in chemo but on the other hand I am grateful to God for it, it killed my cancer and totaly destroyed the cancer in my lymph nodes. Take a deep breath, try as much as possible to make a clear dicision that is not based on side affects and looks. Will be waiting for your decision, what ever you choose will be the best. If you need more help on finances or what ever you need I would be more than happy to help you. As would others.",
