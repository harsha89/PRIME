    "Content": "I am facing the same decision... I have a consultation with a breast surgeon tomorrow.  This is my 2nd cancer in 3 years (my first was signet ring of the colon/appendix - a high grade tumor - stage IIIB)  ...I really am leaning towards a BMX.  I don't want to have to walk around wondering if both cancers might come back.  I will see what she says - but I have heard that ultimately it is up to the patient to decide. I have had the genetic testing - and it was negative.  I have a consultation with a breast surgeon on Tuesday followed by an MRI on Thursday.   Alex",
