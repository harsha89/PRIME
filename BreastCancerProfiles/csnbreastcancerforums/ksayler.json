    "Content": "Marilyn, My last chemo was a year ago and fter all the treatment (surgery, radiation, chemo) was over I felt tired for months. I still feel that I need more sleep than I used to. But I also find that my mind drifts to last year and sometimes I break down and cry, also. I think we do move on, but it is hard to forget all that we have been through. I believe it leaves us very different than we were before. We have been told we have cancer, have faced the fear, waited for biopsy reports, recovered from surgery, gone through treatment, suffered indignities beyond belief (no hair, scarred bodies, early menopause, feeling sick from chemo, etc., etc...need I go on?), and we have survived. I know I am forever changed physically and emotionally. I think it is so normal to just cry sometimes because of the overwhelming burden of it all. Kudos to all of us.....I have never felt stronger emotionally, even though my tears might make it look otherwise. I think your tears are normal and prove how strong YOU have been. Heaven forbid we should ever forget how strong we ALL have proven we are. Good luck, Kathy",
