      "Content": "I am 6 weeks into my Taxol and Herceptin treatments. I also had A/C. The only side effects I've been having are fatigue and am just beginning with some bone pain. I get my treatents on Fridays, and it seems that the side effects begin Monday or Tuesday. I've also wanted to begin changing my diet and excercise routine. Both have been difficult for me. The diet, becasue Holiday cookies and chocolate are just too tempting for me, and the excercise, because...I've been lazy! I do get out of breath very easily, but know I can begin slowly. I wish you much luck in your endeavor! Good luck on the rest of your treatments. Will you be needing radiation? I just found out that I will. I tell the Drs. to give me whatever it will take to kick this Cancer int he butt!",
