      "Content": "Thanks for all the prayers and being with me through this. I am home and not really all that sore,just mainly where the drains are. I think the port hurts more than the actual mastectomy.I still have the onq pain pump in until tomorrow. I had the mastectomy with the exspander put in. Had quite a few lymph nodes taken as well The Dr did not tell me the exact amount just a lot. Was running a fever the whole time at the hospital back to normal now.Blood pressure was also very low,but they said that was due ti the morphine. All in all one step closer to kicking cancer in the A$$. Will keep up dating I have 2 Dr's appointments next Wed. Big ((((Hugs )))) to all",
