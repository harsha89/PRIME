They may go by stastics for a a base, but they have no idea if its going to rear its ugly head or not. There are many survivors out there that were given little time to live and they are here and healthy many years later. I think we all have to be realistic in the fact that yes it could return, but not living our lives trying to focus on that. We are all survivors and intend to stay that way!! :):) I hope you have a wonderful day!! Carlye",
