      "Content": "Hello, I am not really sure what to post. This entire process as hit me hard. Within 2 weeks of my mammogram I had a double mastectomy, actually 2 weeks to the day, which is today. Yesterday I had my drain tubes and all 75 staples removed and physically feeling tons better. I have been told that only the centinal node was positive and all others were clear, so no radiation only chemo. I have my 1st appt with the chemo dr feb 23. Still I am not sure what my feelings are. I want to move forward ASAP with chemo and reconstruction. There is only one dr in my area with recon that i was told about, but i am wanting to check the surrounding areas, which are really close ( anyone out there in the Greensboro, NC area)! I am just so scared and not sure what to do next. I guess most for this is my way to unload and really could benefit from all the knowledge of wonderful ladies out there that I have been reading their posts!",
