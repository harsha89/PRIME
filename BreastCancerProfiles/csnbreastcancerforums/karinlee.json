      "Content": "i just moved to las vegas with my husband while i am going through breast reconstruction. (i was diagnosed with breast cancer after he resigned from his previous job.) i need a good recommendation for a plastic surgeon--not simply someone who has done implants, but someone who has a lot of experience with patients who have had mastectomies, radiation, etc. anyone know a good doc they can recommend? thank you!",
