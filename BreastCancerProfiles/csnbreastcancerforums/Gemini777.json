    "Content": "Hi Pat--I'm new to this chat but wanted to share my story. I was diagnosed in the early stages of breast cancer in February, 2009, had surgery, April 28, followed by 7 weeks of radiation which began on June 2, 2009. I have been on Arimidex since October, 2009. It seems that not long after taking it--I began to feel stiffness in my hands--but I sort of expected this as it was listed as one of the side affects. I take Caltrate--it contains 600 vitamin D, a multivitamin with D, and try to really eat foods high in vitamin D and drink milk with my cereal and eat lots of yogurt. I also find that stretching and squeezing one of those rubber foam balls at night also makes a big difference in reducing stiffness in my hands in the morning and I try to do this throughout the day. I am hopeful this will be the most severe side effect that I experience, thus, I will try my best to get through the treatment for the 5 year period. I was told by a nurse at one of the Cancer hotlines that while uncomfortable, if you are experiencing hot flashes--this means the Arimidex is working because it blocks estrogen. I know it's hard but please try not to worry about the mammo. I will keep you in my prayers and know that you will be well.",
