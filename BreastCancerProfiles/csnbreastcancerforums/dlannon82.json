      "Content": "Five months out of radiation, and on a silly internet questionnaire being circulated among family and friends, yesterday I answered that I have 4 tatoos. Knowing my feelings about his one, discreet tatoo, my son wrote back saying, \"Mom, you do NOT have 4 tatoos.\" I laughed, realizing I had finally claimed them for my own as a sign of my recovery. And some day you will, too! Your feelings are normal. Good luck!",
