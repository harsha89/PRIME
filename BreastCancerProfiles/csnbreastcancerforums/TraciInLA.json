AIs are not an option for us, unless we take other steps to remove or shut down our ovaries -- otherwise, it's Tamoxifen or nuthin'. I'm 42, and not even a little bit menopausal yet :-). I've been on Tamoxifen for almost 2 years, and hot flashes have been the only major side effect. For me, switching to taking it in the morning instead of the evening, and taking Vitamin E has really helped keep the hot flashes down. Tamoxifen hasn't affected my periods at all -- still very normal and regular. And I find that I shave my legs much less frequently, but haven't noticed any thinning at all on my head (I haven't closely inspected any other places :-o). I'm overweight (since well before my diagnosis), and do find it almost impossible to lose weight since going on Tamoxifen -- if I keep up the exercise, I don't gain weight, but I don't lose it either. I faithfully see my gynecologist every year -- so far, absolutely no gynecological problems or scares at all. But -- for me -- I can put up with all that, if it will continue to keep the bad cancer juju away! Traci",

I did 4 rounds of TC, and am prone to canker sores anyway, so my oncologist had me start using Biotene mouthwash before I even started chemo. You can get it from any drugstore, it's not expensive, and has a very pleasant, mild taste. I used it religiously all through chemo, and only had a couple of very minor mouth sores -- I highly recommend it. If you do get mouth sores, there are definitely mouthwashes your oncologist can prescribe, and, as several of the ladies here have said, they work really well. Hope that helps? Traci",

My diagnosis was somewhat similar to yours: bilateral breast cancer, invasive ductal in one breast, invasive lobular in the other, total of 4 tumors, none larger than 2 mm. ER+/PR+/HER2-. No lymph node involvement. I refused the Oncotype test, because I knew I wanted to do chemo. My oncologist ran a computer simulation that estimated that chemo might lower my chances of recurrence by 3-4%, and I said great, when do we start? I had two main reasons: Most importantly, I couldn't live with myself if the cancer were to come back down the road, and I was left wondering, what if I'd done chemo? I needed to do everything I could. My other consideration was age. I'm 40, so have many estrogen-filled years ahead of me before menopause, even after the 5 years of Tamoxifen. You'll hear soon from other women here who chose chemo or didn't -- it's such a personal choice, and there are lots of reasons either way. Chemo was probably the most difficult thing I've ever done in my life, but it's doable -- at no time did I think, \"I can't do this.\" For my life and my own personal situation, I'm proud of my decision. Please come back often, Mesa, and bring all your questions. Traci",

I asked my oncologist: You're pumping me full of this stuff anyway, can I take over-the-counter Benadryl the night before and night after each chemo, to help me sleep? He agreed, and it definitely helped. If Benadryl also makes you sleepy, can't hurt to ask your oncologist if this would be okay for you too?

Some of you will remember that my family was asked to participate in a study last year for families like mine with a strong history of breast cancer, but who are BRCA-negative. Through this study, I found out that I carry the PALB2 genetic mutation, which is just starting to be studied for its possible connection to breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancer. The study results were published last month, in the August 7th issue of The New England Journal of Medicine, \u201cBreast-Cancer Risk in Families with Mutations in PALB2.\u201d  Where it says \u201cWe analyzed the risk of breast cancer among 362 members of 154 families\u2026\u201d \u2013 one of those 362 people is ME! The study got a lot of media attention, as it found that breast cancer risk for female PALB2 carriers as compared with the general population was 5 to 9 times higher, depending on age.  This particular study didn\u2019t look at ovarian or pancreatic cancer risks, so those are still really unknown. Because there\u2019s still so little data, there are no recommendations for what I'm supposed to now DO with all this sexy new information about my famous genes.  My oncologist is sending me to a geneticist who specializes in PALB2 research, and I\u2019m seeing her next week.  I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m anxious \u2013 it feels like we\u2019re looking into a crystal ball to try to figure out what's most likely to kill me, which just doesn\u2019t sound like a fun conversation.  At the same time, I certainly want her input, and to hear what her recommendations might be.

I'm sure most of us will recognize our friends, family, and co-workers here! Traci ____________________ Cancer Commentary by Matt Nelson I recently got diagnosed with cancer \u2014 that\u2019s the easy part. After the doctor told me I had a significant amount of cancer in my prostate, I did my homework. I spoke to friends who have had prostate cancer. I spoke to all the doctors. I went online a little bit. The decision to have surgery was pretty clear so I chose a surgeon and scheduled a date. Like I said, that was the easy part. Far harder, has been navigating all of you. That\u2019s right, all of you \u2014 navigating your reactions and your comments after hearing I have cancer. There\u2019s the Over-The-Top-Cheerleader: \u201cYou can beat this, you can beat this!! My mother had ALL her organs removed and she\u2019s still alive!!\u201d One guy actually told me cancer is a fastball and I am going to hit the cancer fastball over the fence for a cancer homerun. When I get one of these motivational speeches, that is the only time I am sure I am going to die. Or there\u2019s the Funny Guy, the guy who thinks the right thing to do is break out his cancer humor. A friend of mine was at a children\u2019s restaurant. Here\u2019s the text message he sent me: \u201cI\u2019m at Chuck E. Cheese \u2014 the cancer of restaurants.\u201d I didn\u2019t laugh. Or there\u2019s the Interrogator: \u201cWhat stage is it? What stage is it? Are you going to die? Do they give you odds? Has it spread? Is it all throughout your body? What\u2019s the surgery like? Do they cut you open? What kind of scalpel do they use? Are you scared, are you scared, are you scared?\u201d Actually, no. I wasn\u2019t that scared until you CONVINCED me to be scared. And I wasn\u2019t thinking about the odds of my dying. But I am now. So thank you for putting that thought into my head. So what does that leave? What is left to say to the person who has been recently diagnosed with cancer? Well...allow me to demonstrate: \u201cI\u2019m really sorry. That\u2019s crappy news. I believe you can get through this. Is there anything I can do to help?\u201d That\u2019s it.",

With my chemo nurse's approval, I bought Johnson's Baby Shampoo, and used that on my head all through chemo and until I had enough hair to style. I figured -- it's made for sensitive little bald heads, so it'd probably be good for mine! And the familiar scent from my childhood was comforting to me. Watch your scalp for itchy red bumps -- folliculitis, which is very common. Let your doctor know if you get this -- they can give you a prescription acne medication that works for most people to clear it right up. Finally...if you decide to \"go naked\" (I always did, when I was indoors), BE SURE that your little scalp NEVER sees any sun! The last thing that virgin baby skin needs is a sunburn! Traci",

That being said, I don't see how radiation to my breasts can affect my brain. That just doesn't make sense to me. I absolutely do believe the STRESS of having cancer can and does affect just about everyone's cognitive abilities to some degree. Doesn't matter what treatment you do or don't have. So how can the researchers remove stress from the equation, and just choose to blame the radiation? And, given that hormonal therapy such as Tamoxifen by definition affects estrogen, which every menopausal woman knows can affect cognitive abilities, I had to laugh at the researchers' statement that they did not find that hormonal therapy played any part.

I really do think a lot of it depends on how deep the tumors are, i.e, how deep they have to \"go fishing,\" so to speak. On the other side of it, I know that the sentinel node mapping (the \"blue dye\" injected around your nipple, if you're having a sentinel node biopsy done) is really painful for some women, but it was almost painless for me.

I had bilateral lumpectomies before chemo, but only had 3 lymph nodes removed from each side (all negative), so am considered extremely low risk for lymphedema -- so was able to use either arm for chemo infusions. I have excellent veins in both arms, but even still the chemo nurses sometimes had to switch arms to find the best vein -- they said something about how chemo IVs have to be deeper than regular IVs? (the nurses here on this board would be able to explain this better than I can) For only 4 rounds, with both arms to choose from, I was glad I didn't go to the trouble of getting a port. However, if I only had one arm to work with, I would be sure to talk it over with your oncologist. You also might ask to meet with one of the chemo nurses -- your oncologist (who doesn't actually do the IVs him/herself) may say, oh, your veins are fine, while the nurses (who do this all day every day) may have a better opinion from experience.

(My partner, who has been heroically supportive through all this and is always looking for ways to make me laugh, thinks \u201csalpingo-oophorectomy\u201d sounds like a bad Starbucks order: \u201cI\u2019ll have a nonfat decaf salpingo-oophorectomy, please\u201d) I was still menstruating regularly, so the surgery has thrown me into abrupt, full-blown surgical menopause.  The last 3 weeks have been really, really tough.  I couldn\u2019t sleep more than an hour or 2 without waking up with night sweats, I woke up one day with a zit on my nose for the first time in years and cried for an hour, and I spend a lot of time wandering around the house having no idea why I walked into this room or why I\u2019m carrying this or that with me.

After I healed from radiation, I also had frequent, intense bouts of itching, particularly around my lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy scars. It gradually got less and less over the first year, but even still (2 1/2 years since radiation ended), I sometimes get a little mild itching around the scars. Definitely call your radiation oncologist's office, and ask what he/she recommends -- there's no reason to suffer, and they're experts on skin healing from radiation. I had a prescription cream immediately after radiation to help with the itching (I'm sorry, I don't remember what it was called) -- once it lessened, my doctor told me just to use over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream. Hope that helps? Traci",

      "Content": "I strongly believe in understanding everything about my treatment as much as possible, and in asking my doctors to explain *why* they're recommending a particular treatment, so definitely ask your radiation oncologist to explain to you why he's recommending a certain number. It's important to remember that the radiation equipment itself differs, and different doctors use different protocols on different equipment. On this board, I've heard of women having anywhere from 28 to 33 treatments, so your doctor's recommendation sounds right in line with that. In my case, I had lumpectomies with clear margins and clear lymph nodes, and had 28 radiation treatments with 5 boosters, so 33 total. Hope that helps, Traci",

When everything started growing again -- I had to go hunting to remember where I'd put my tweezers! Traci",

Like MyTurn said, please remember that not everyone loses their eyebrows. I did 4 rounds of Taxotere/Cytoxan (I'm sorry, I don't remember what cocktail you're doing?), and my eyebrows stopped growing, but stayed exactly the same until toward the very end, then thinned out for a few weeks, then grew right back very quickly. I would suggest that you take that $120 and spend it on cute hats, scarves, maybe a beautiful pair of earrings or lipstick -- things that help you feel feminine and attractive. For me, I found that was a worthwhile way to spend my money, and helped me feel better during chemo. Traci",
