      "Content": "Mar, I will be undergoing this surgery also. Mine is scheduled for 7:00 am on July 16. The day before they will inject my right nipple with radioactive dye. Because they did find a small amount of cancer in my right breast. The dye is so that they can find the sentinel node. That's the first node after the cancer so that they can see if the cancer has made it to the nodes. At the time of my mastectomies they will check this node first by running like a gieger counter over to find which one it is, then removing it and passing it to a pathologist right there in the operating room. The pathologist checks for cancer in that node and so if it is clear they proceed on and I get reconstruction started right then. If it is not cleared they will take more nodes, and I will probably need radiation as soon as the mastectomies are complete and will get reconstruction when that is all done. So, We're hoping for clean and clear nodes. Everyone keeps telling me I'll be fine, just fine. Easy for them to say, right? Oh I know I'll be o.k. either way. But, after all the biopsies and tests, I just want this to be done so I can be fine right now!",
