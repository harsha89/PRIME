Taxol is milder I think, not sure, you can ask your onc. But, there is no nausea with Taxotere and my hair started to grow back. :) Good luck!",

I asked my onc about it, I just need to eat lighter stuff... not heavy or spicy. I also take Prilosec, and tums seems to help... Mine only lasts about 3 days, it's annoying, but it goes away. My throat hurts from drainage from my nose... but again, it only lasts a few days then that goes away, too. Good luck.",

Little peach fuzz!! I was kind of excited, but also realize that it could just fall out... Has this happened to anyone else? Will it keep growing or fall out.",
