      "Content": "Violet, that is an amazing story. There are many angels that assist us along the way and it is wonderful to hear those stories. Kelly, cry and cry some more. It's all in perfect order. Remember to reach out to those angels that are there, sometimes in unusual places and sometimes we just don't see that far ahead, one day at a time. This is a great place to let it all out without worrying about feeling sorry for ourselves, we have all been there, it sucks, but it is making you stronger in the end. Your beauty is still there my dear Kelly, it's on the inside for now but you will get better and love your outside again. I have not had a great cry yet, I have held back for all these months, since April, and know it's coming and will embrace that too. Love you Kelly and love all the kind and brave women that are here, R",

My name is Rosemarie but my brother used to call me RoseyPosey, he died 10 years ago of cancer so it reminds me of him and how he used to tease me as a kid. Of course, I miss him dearly. My picture is more about me. I used to teach yoga dance and that picture is how I felt when I taught my class. Of course the picture of the woman doesn't look at all like me since I am 57 years old and a bit chubby but hey, when I am feeling good I imagine looking like that. Gonna get back to my yoga dance as soon as me treatment allows.",

      "Content": "the insurance is a whole other problem that cancer patients don't need to worry about, but seems like the insurance companies don't care. My Arimidex isn't covered by my insurance(I am lucky to have insurance) so it has been quite a financial burden. Don't understand why they don't cover such an important drug. I will check out the site, thanks R",
