    "Content": "I just celebrated my new birthday, March 3. This year was 11 years, cancer free. I remember the wind being sucked out of my body the day I was told I had breast cancer. I had a 12 year old daughter still to raise and I worried if I would be around to see her graduate from high school. I worried that she would be forced to grow up without a mom and I just wanted to live long enough to see her through those tough teen years. My son had just met the girl of his dreams and I thought it would be nice to see him graduate from college and get married. When my daughter turned 18 and graduated, I thought perhaps I had not been greedy enough in my request for time. I watched her blow out her 23 candles last month and announce her engagement. In these past 11 years, I have known such joy and now count 2 grandchildren and one more on the way. What an awesome gift these last 11 years have been. I know when I was first diagonosed, none of this seemed possible. So, hope you can take something from my success and look forward to when you will have 11 or more years behind you as well.",
