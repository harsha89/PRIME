I had blood tests done a couple weeks ago and it showed my body was depleted of B-12 and I was having all kinds of side affects that were scaring me. I am on a program to have one a month. Hope this gives you something else to think about for a reason. I had my eyes checked in Oct. and there was a 2 point difference in the right eye and 1.5 in the left eye. I had never had such a significant change before. Take care. Jazz",
