    "Content": "Hey Terri.....similar situation here. It does get better...I am 6 months post radiation and some days its almost back to normal and some days, fuller than usual but no more pain and the skin has healed. My radiation oncologist did say \"we don't know why some people have this kind of reaction\" although I am also large breasted and this may be why we all have had similar problems. I will add that I wore sleeveless tees..the stretchy ones. Kinda kept me secure, if ya know what I mean without having to wear a bra. Good luck and best wishes. Karen",
