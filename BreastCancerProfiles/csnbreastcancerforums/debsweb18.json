      "Content": "It's an individual choice. I had an immediate implant (no expanders) during my unilateral mastectomy. The only problem was that I had radiation afterwards. The implant shrunk and my 1st plastic surgeon's answer to that was to replace it with another implant and then later inject fat to round it out. She had already done the nipple reconstruction. (don't get that done until you're absolutely sure you're done with reconstruction). The replacement implant pushed the new nipple up too far. She lifted my other side (twice to try to achieve symmetry). What I found out after going to a new plastic surgeon and reading more on the subject is that implants after radiation don't always give the best results. The skin can become so tight, it will only stretch so far. My new PS relifted my other side a 3rd time and I had much better results. Because I was so pleased with his work, next week I will be having a lattissmus dorsi flap. He will cut out the reconstructed nipple and I will have healthier skin, muscle and tissue across my breast which should give me better results and shaping. I may have to have an expander put in if my plastic surgeon doesn't like the results with an implant at the time of surgery. I really trust this doctor. He spends so much time with me talking about all of my options and listens to me. My first PS wasn't like that at all. Having said all of that, I will end up having at least 2 more surgeries than I should have had. However, reconstruction is not necessarily a one shot surgery. Expect revisions. I didn't know this going in and wish I had. I don't expect to have perfectly matched breasts- it won't happen. However, I shouldn't have a nipple on the top side of my breast either! I'm getting close to 3 years from diagnosis and will be glad to get my reconstruction done!  This is just my experience. I'm sure you'll hear many more!    Hope this help!  ",

Where I scratched was much worse during the rest of treatment. OTC cortisone helped some, but not completely. Aquaphor with lidocaine (the RO mixed it up for me) helped. Then I started adding aloe gel to Aquaphor. And I agree-it's not stupid! We're all at different stages of treatments and some have more than others. But we've all one difficulty or another and they're all important! And did I say \"Don't Scratch\"? Deb",
