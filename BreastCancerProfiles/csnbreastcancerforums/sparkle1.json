      "Content": "This is my second bout with BC.  First surgery on the right breast 7 years ago.  I STILL have what feels like a lump to me, but every year after my mammograph I ask and they tell me it is scar tissue.  I am an Africian American Women and they say we kelo easier and scar tissue takes a long time to go away, if ever.  I had my second surgery on the left breast on April 26 and the scar tissue has almost gone away.  I had different surgeons and maybe one was more skilled than the other.  Try not to worry about it too much but keep asking every chance you get and every doctor you see.  Early detection right!   I'm waiting on the results of my oncotype test to help decide if I need chemo this time around.  If not, I will get 20 rounds of radiation starting the 3rd week of this month.  The waiting for all the test results is stressing me out.  I have some anxiety about  radiation on the left side so close to the heart.  The radiation oncologist said we have to be very careful but they can position me on the table so that they can avoid radiating any of the heart tissues.  Have anyone had discussions on radiation and the heart?",

      "Content": "Hello everyone, Well after 7 years I'm back again!  This is not a recurrence, it a new breast cancer on the left breast this time.  I had surgery, chemo and radiation the first time around on the right breast, then took meds. for 5 years.  I so thought this was over!!! Well, I had surgery on April 26, 2017 on the left breast and according to my surgeon, the surgery was a success.  However, he is still recommending chemo and radiation.  I see the medical oncologist next Tuesday to get her recommendation. This first time around I communicated with people from this site and it was very helpful so I'm here asking for your help once. again.  I'm feeling very overwhelmed and a bit scared.  Can I do this again?  I'm almost 60 years old; OK 59 1/2.   Signed, Here we go again",

The day after chemo I had the Neulasta shot which makes your bones ache for a few days but advil relieved the pain. One accident happened that the taxotere leaked from the IV on to my skin (wrist area) which caused a chemical burn that I am still dealing with almost 2 months later. I will keep your family in my prayers Sparkle",
