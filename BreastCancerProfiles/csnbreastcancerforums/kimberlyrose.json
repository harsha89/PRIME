      "Content": "Hi. I'm new to this website. I had a bilateral mastectomy in November because of extensive DCIS. I had a number of complications after surgery that slowed down my recovery considerably. Thankfully none of the DCIS had become invasive and I'm not scheduled for any additional cancer treatment at this time. I am getting ready to start my expander fills for reconstruction though. I'm interested in learning more about exercises that can help me get back into shape. I'm afraid to push myself for fear of doing damage, but I'm also gaining weight by the day. Ideas, suggestions?",

      "Content": "Hi Christine. I too am new here and totally get what you're saying. I had bilateral mastectomy 9 weeks ago. I tend to be very \"intellectual\" about things. So I did all the research, understood my options, and accepted my fate as logical and practical. Then it hit me the day before my surgery. I was terrified and couldn't stop the emotions from spilling out. Denial is great until the dam breaks. I don't have an easy solution. Some trust spirituality, some trust data, some just hope all is going to be well. whatever suits you... use it. And know that we'll be here. Kimberly",
