    "Content": "Cindy, Unfortunately the practice of backgroung checks including credit checks for potential job candidates is happening more and more and in strange places sometimes. I carry a corporate credit card with a substsantial limit. The company can use credit information in some cases to make decisions regarding potential problems. Although the card should be used for business purposes only, we have had to terminate individuals for misuse. Is it fair? It makes good business since in some caes, not all. Is it misused? YES, everyday. Some auto insurance companies now use credit reports to justify an increase in what you pay. If a potential employer reveals (which many don't) that they will be doing a credit check you should question how it fit into the hiring process. Most upfront employers will let you know during the application process that a credit check is one thing that will be used during the decision making process. Get a free copy of your credit report and be prepared for any questions or situations that may come up. You can also do a google search on \"credit reports and employers/employment\". You still have rights, exercise them. You said it best, put it in God's hands and ask Him for gudiance, direction and strength. I will keep you in my prayers and thoughts. And good luck on finding employment. Nellie",
