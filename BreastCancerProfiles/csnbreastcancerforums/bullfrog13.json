I just kept my finernails cut short and most of time wrapped the end of my fingers in bandaids. Looked like heck, but it felt better. Good luck hon. Many hugs. Jerilynfrog13@yahoo.com",

      "Content": "Dear Rayswife Alot depends on which chemo combo you were given and which side effects you were inquiring about. Not all chemo makes you bald - so Im not sure if that is what you meant---if that is the case there isnot much you can do about it. The ''upset tummy'' can be controlled with several different precriptions you just have to find the right one that works for you. And like everyone else says WATER WATER WATER is your best friend. The more you drink the faster you flush your system and the better you will feel. best of luck jerilyn",

      "Content": "Dear Jill I gave birth in 1981 and was given something to stop milk production - it was not a shot however - it was a hugh pill and I was given the pill while still in the hosptial. I only recieved it one time. I never produced an ounce of milk from that day forward. When baby #2 came along 17 months later (i now have 2 step kids, and two foster kids) I was also given pills to stop milk production, only this time a presciption that I told several times a day for a about a week. For some odd reason I remember them being red--who knows why I remember that-it was 20 years ago??*shurgs shoulders* Anyway, I can not tell you the name of either-----but here I am NOW at 43 - BC survivor.

      "Content": "Leenie, Your story sounds so familur. While I have never ran in a marathon, or even around the block for that matter, I too was feeling good when I found lump in breast while sitting in the tub one day. I had just come off a week vacation and had worked on house all week. When they told me I had cancer 5 weeks , 3 doctors, 2 sonograms,1 mamo, and a needle biospy later, I thought they had to be wrong because I did not feel sick at all. I walked around in denial for next few days, until I had to have a chemo port put in, and see an ongoligist. (did I spell that wrong-YES im sure I did!) anyway.... I am like you I had teenagers everywhere! Two in college, one of which was getting married in July the next year, my father was really sick ( he passed away the day after my surgery) I left the hospital a day early and me and my 5 drain tubes attended the funeral) I had Four kids still in high school with 3 boys playing football and headed for the state playoffs. I DID NOT HAVE TIME to be sick! Well here I am two years, one week and 4 days later ( but who's counting) I now have Two in college, one married and working, one in HS and two in the service (one in Army who is in Korea now and one at basic at lackland) I wish you the best and feel free to email me if you ever need a shoulder!
