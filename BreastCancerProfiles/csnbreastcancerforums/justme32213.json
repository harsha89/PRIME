      "Content": "Hi Lisa here, I was diagnosed in March of 2013 and had a mastectomy of my left breast in October the same year. To date i am still very tender, sore, sometimes swollen and numb. My oncologist and my surgeon both said it is normal. Exercise that arm every day for at least 10 minutes and a few times a day if possible. I do it in the shower, it feels great, and I also do it right before bed. Hope this helps....this too shall pass they say.Â ",
