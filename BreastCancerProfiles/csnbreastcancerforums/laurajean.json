    "Content": "Hi Jeanne, I can understand...I had a hysterectomy in 1998. I didn't have hot flahes. In August of 2002 I had a masectomy and reconstruction (TRAM flap), and in November started Tamoxifen. The hot flahes are bad. I am 52 years old. I was diagnosed with depression April 2002, before I was diagnosed with breast cancer, July 1, 2002. I am on Prozac. Probably a blessing. I couldn't imagine not being on it. I've actually found good in my experience rather than rage. I've heard of and met many who are unbearably emotional on Tamoxifen. Don't feel silly. Talk to your doctors. I go to the oncologist in another week. Need relief for my hot flashes too. Contact me direct of you like. Laura Jean (laurajean.palma@verizon.net)",
