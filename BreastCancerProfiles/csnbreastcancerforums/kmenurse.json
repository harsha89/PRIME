She has graduated with her associates nursing degree.  I now will have my own private nurse...lol   I am so proud of her.  She returned to school at age 34 to achieve this.  She stayed home to raise her sons first. Therefore, if you should ever encounter a nurse named Shelly she could be my daughter...",

Good luck.... Kathy",

I know that when you have nausea/vomiting, drinking fluids doesn't sound good but if you don't you will become dehydrated.  So even if, it comes back up please replace it. A sports drink will help replace the electrolytes lost.  If the vomiting don't improve then maybe you should call your Doctor, you may need IV fluids.  And again I am so sorry that you are experiencing this....God Bless!...
