    "Content": "This is such good information. I am having my surgery next week. I need a right mastectomy and the plan is for a muscle sparring flap. I just found this site today and have been reading everything I can over my lunch. It has been so helpful to hear how it has gone for many people. I am a nurse practitioner, worked as a nurse post op units for many years in my early days. I took care of a good many radical mastectomy patients so it is hard for me to get that out of my head. Such good info on what I will be able to wear post-op. I will have to do a bit of shopping for some loose fitting button tops this weekend. I kept thinking loose t-shirts but keep forgetting that my right arm might be a bit sore from the sentinel node biopsy. You talk about using a recliner. How did you sleep when you got home? I am a side sleeper, how long till I can do that again? (I'm guessing I will be so fatigued I would sleep standing up if I had to). I will be having a epidural for pain control for the first few days post-op. The doctor I have has been getting really good results with this instead of the morphine pumps. This has somewhat relieved my fear of the pain. Good to hear that you did not have alot when you got home. I hate taking meds that make me feel out of it. I am so glad I found this site. Thanks for all the info. Kathy",
