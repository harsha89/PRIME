      "Content": "So I've been on tamoxifen for 7 months now and we all know that sweating and hot flashes are a part of it, right? Now it's Dec and colder in NY and I am worse than when it was 95 in the summer! We've been Christmas shopping and I go out wearing lightweight pants and a short sleeve shirt, everyone else is in winter coats and boots. I'm in a store for a few minutes and the sweat is pouring off of me! Mind you I have my hair in a ponytail to keep it off my neck and it is, sorry to be gross, saturated! I can actually wring out my ponytail and fill a bucket!! The littlest activity leaves me dripping! I have to actually blow dry my hair a few times a day and wash it every night. Is this normal? Is anyone else experiencing this? Again, I could understand if it was summer and hot but it's not! It's driving me crazy!! I am just one big sweaty mess : ) Angela",

      "Content": "I have been on it now 2 months. it took till week 5 to start the hot flashes. they were bad, every 30 minutes! then I was very tired all day. I was put on effexor and my hot flashes are better. they are more like normal menopause flashes. i solved the exhaustion by taking the tamox at night. now I sleep better. i do get bone aches. it seems to have inflamed my already bad knee. at times my hip joints hurt. I have gained weight. I won't even get on the scale anymore because it is too depressing. the weird side effect is that smells bother me. i have always been sensitive to smells but now it's like i'm pregnant! the smell of cooking eggs or meat makes me gag! I don't have much choice except to not take it and risk a recurrence,so I suffer through! Hopefully you will be lucky and not have any issues. angela",

The Miralax is totally tasteless and not that bad in the cramping and elimination stuff. I only finished half the drink because I was sick of the gatorade, but still cleaned out. So much better than what they used to use. angela",

Think of the hospital stay as a small vacation from cleaning and cooking and caring for everyone else. Spend it relaxing and catching up on tv shows. While not the best place to be you can still make the most of it and be babied and cared for. It just sucks that you have to endure all this but you will get through it. I don't even know you well but get the feeling that you will be fine. I will be thinking of you~ Angela",

Keep an eye on it even after it clears up. It can become chronic, so if you ever feel this way again, make sure it hasn't come back. Also, make sure it is totally cleared up before you stop the antibiotics because it will come back after a few days. I hope you feel better soon and never have to deal with it again. Good luck to you! Angela",

I was sad to know that these girls that took care of me wouldn't be an active part in my life any more. I felt very sad and weepy for a few weeks after. I guess it is all normal. I felt like as long as I was getting treatment everything would be ok. Now that nothing is being done I started to worry about the what ifs. I am now 2 months out of rads and finally starting to feel better, less weepy. I have also started tamoxifen and now effexor.So know, you are normal : ) and not alone!!!! Angela",
