      "Content": "Hi, Ii jsut had my 3rd A/C on tuesday and have enough hair that I do local shopping, volunteer work at resource center/food bank, and all around house stuff, yard stuff with bare head or whatever I feel like. actually I just look like my baby pictures, some see through to scalp spots, and my hair is still growing, where the bangs I cut 1 inch or less before the 2nd chemo when so much was falling out at a time, are now nearly 2 inches long which is about my normal growth rate. don't panic. it will all work out. I use a native american medicine man ( a Pueblo who learned from his grandmother) in addition to the prayers of my church and thousands of others in prayer chains accross the country. losts of good responses will be coming in...although it may take some of us a while to get used to this new fancy format. cher",

      "Content": "hey guys, give it a few days. I was so tired of having to watch the dizzy-making spin of messages flickering by. Maybe it is because I am used to old bulletin board style, but this is easier to me except I can't see the print on my reply, so you'all will just have to put up with the typos. hope things are going well for everyone. hugs cher",
