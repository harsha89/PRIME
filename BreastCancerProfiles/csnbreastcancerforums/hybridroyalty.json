    "Content": "I know exactly how you feel because I went down that road a while ago. I ended up refusing chemo, radiation and tamoxifen. Your mind plays a huge role with your healing and recovery so you have to go with what you FEEL is best. If you still feel strongly against chemo, you may want to research Brenda Cobbs and Dr. Lorraine Day...two women who refused chemo. Sending you hugs.",
