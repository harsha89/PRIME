    "Content": "I had my las chemo August of 2002. My hair has ALWAYS grown very slowly. My Dr. said for the type of chemo I had (AC) it stays in your system for 6 mos., so I would probably be wearing a bandana until February. Well, by Christmas, it was long enough to go without. It is now May and my hair is almost 3\" long...pretty good for me. My hair was naturally very light blonde; it is now light brown, but still straight. Aside from the color, I kinda like it! And, like everyone else, I am grateful to be alive and healthy!",
