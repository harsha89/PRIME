    "Content": "I was diagnosis 10 years ago with breast cancer in my left breast. I had a lumpectomy, chemo and radiation. Now here I am 10 years later with a tumor in the right breast. I am so confused about what to do. Do I want another lumpectomy, radiation maybe chemo. Or do I just want to have a bilateral masectomy and be done with this whole mess. My left breast is considerably small as a result of radiation. If I was to get cancer in either breast again a masectomy would be necessary. Also maybe older and not as healthy. Took the BRACA test which turns into an insurance nightmare between approvals and denals. any thoughts....",
