      "Content": "I'm having problems with neuropathy, too.  I have an appointment with a neurologist this Thursday.  I'll share on site what I learned. I just finished chemo on 8/15 so I'm not far enough along to get rid of anything.  But I can completely understand you concerns for the future.  I had a DCIS on one side and Stage 1 Invasive Ductal Carcinoma on the other. After chemo I decided to pass on rads and will be going in for a double mastectomy with reconstruction the end of this month.  I know this won't be an absolute guarantee that cancer won't return, but I feel there are fewer side effects than rads so I feel safer. We all react differently to various stages in this journey.  At each crossroads we have to chose when and what to do that is best for ourselves.  After all, no one is walking in our shoes but ourselves. Remember we are here for you and look forward to hearing how you are doing; good or bad or angry or laughing.  We care. Sandy",

I think this might simplify your tests and treatments. Good luck.  Show them how strong you can be by making them work together.  Your onco is the CA specialist and probably should be making final decisions (with you, of course). Please give us updates so we know how to pray, support you, and when you're in need of the Pink Bus.",

      "Content": "You are not a bad caregiver.  Think how much worse she would feel if you paid little to no attention to her.  One of my daughters treats this disease as no big deal, no rush for treatment is necessary.  My other daughter is hundreds of miles away, but when she calls even (or especially) to talk about my grandkids it's like an invitation back into the real world again. If she has friends nearby talk to them about visiting.  Let them know what to expect ahead of time. My friend was over one hot day and said \"take that hat off, you look like your going to melt.\" She wasn't shocked by my bald head.  After my dbl mastectomy a week ago last Friday she even helped me bathe my first couple days home.  It went along way in making me less freakish. I'm not saying invite friends over and let them greet mom in her birthday suit.  But let her see her friends are not repulsed by her in her nighty or street clothes could go a long way to make her more comfortable. Also I went to TLCdirect (click on hair loss and mastectomy products in the blue column on left).  I bought a vest with velcro front closing.  It also has 2 pockets with stuffung (removable) That she can wear with stuffing in one side to even things out.  That way she can go out in public and feel more normal. Do keep in mind that we can be emotional at times with the best care.  I just spent half a day in tears for no specific reason.  My system just needed to let off steam, and that's a good thing. I started out with 2 small cancers, one on each side.  Lumpectomy and radiation would be all I needed the doctor said at first.  After the lumpectomies, they tested the tumors and found I had a 22% chance of recurrance without chemo.  I took the chemo and then they wanted me to do 33 rounds of radition.  I chose dbl mastectomy over radiation.  I don't say it's right for everyone, but it is for me. If the doctor is recommending chemo ask him why he thinks this is necessary.  Tests may have shown a necessity.  Talk things over with your mom, but please let the final decision be hers.  It is her body and as much as you may want to \"make it all better\", she has to live with the results. I sounds like you're doing a great job with your love and support. Remember  professional help is available for both of you if necessary.  Cancer is a huge weight to carry. Prayers and hugs to you both, Sandy  ",

I had small cancers in both breasts.  After chemo I chose BMX over radiation.  I felt the chemo had done enough damage and radiation was only going to put my heart, lungs and other things at more risk. With Arimidex I don't fear a cancer return as much as if I didn't take it.  I prefer a bit of pain with a side order of peace of mind.  This is my way of handling it, but everyone is different and also have different SE.
