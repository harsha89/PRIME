      "Content": "I agree. I developed diverticulitus after the chemo. I kept mentioning pain on the lower left side. The oncologist knew it wasn't cancer so he wasn't interested. The family doctor was blinded the the big C issue and even through she said it was diverticulitis she didn't treat it. Finally I switched doctors to an internest (sp) and he sent me to a gut doc and I had a scope. Eventually it got settled and I can manage it now. Find a doctor that will work with you. Take care - Debw",

      "Content": "I remember the tube pulling as a baby ouch. I was anxious to get them out. As soon as she had them the site was just tender - but not really painful. They were annoying after a few days so I glad to get them out. I had surgery on a Monday, left hospital on Thursday, and had the tubes pulled the next week. It depends on how much they are still draining. Keep us posted. Debw",

I recommend getting a prescription of EMLA which is a lidocaine cream. I would apply an hour before treatment and felt absolutly no pain. For all the blood drawns and chemos it is the only way to go. Everyone should get one. Love, Deb",
