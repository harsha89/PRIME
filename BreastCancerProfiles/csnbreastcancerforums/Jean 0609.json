First underwent a lumpectomy. However, I ended up having a mastectomy of my left breast May 4, 2010. I had my first chemo treatment last Wednesday (June 23rd). I have 3 left to go. I am taking Taxotere & Cytoxam. Plus I have to take Herceptin for one year. So far so good. The first two nights were sleepless (due to the steroids). Thursday & Friday were good days. Because of the 100 degree heat, I didn't do anything. Saturday I went out early to a BACK TO FIT program. After that I was no good for the rest of the day. Worn out. Plus that is when my taste buds went crazy. I was starving, but couldn't taste anything. Other than that, I feel pretty lucky. Will I feel the same after the next treatments, or is there a chance that my side effects will get worse?",

I did see on a t.v . show, if you are having problems falling asleep because your mind won't stop, start at 300 and count backwards by 3's. They say since you have to concentrate on counting, this takes your mind off everything else and should put you to sleep. I haven't really tried it yet, but may do so these next couple nights.
