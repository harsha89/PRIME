Doc told me to get Aquaphor. Sure has been a long year. I had gotten married only 3 months prior to finding out I had non-invasive DCIS....anyway, I'm on the road to a wonderful life and I wanted to thank all of you who have corresponded with me in the past. You are all wonderful people and I appreciate you. dharmal.",

      "Content": "Hi there..I had lumpectomy in January for DCIS. The margins were positive, so surgeon wants to re-excise. I really don't want to do any more than I have to and am unsure what to decide now. I am leery of radiation as well due to some of the side effects. the followup mammogram showed no residual calcifications...I'm thinking of having an ultrasound next and then decide from there...any input would be greatly appreciated",
