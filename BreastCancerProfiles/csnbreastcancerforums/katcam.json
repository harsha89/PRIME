      "Content": "i received the following in an email - i thought it was one of those crap emails, but i tested my own lipsticks on my hand and i did get a black streak on my hand from all of them!! >Subject: >Serious: Lipstick alert !! >Subject: Lipstick Alert!!! > You might just want to stop wearing lipstick>  This comes from someone who works in the breast cancer unit at Mt.Sinai Hospital , in Toronto . From: Dr. Nahid Neman   If there is a female you care anything about, share this with her. I did!!!!!  Recently a lipstick brand called \"Red Earth\" decreased their prices From $67 to $9.90.Ã\u0082Â  It contained lead. Lead is a chemical which causes cancer. The lipstick Brands that contain lead are: 1. CHRISTIAN DIOR 2. LANCOME 3. CLINIQUE 4. Y.S.L 5. ESTEE LAUDER 6 SHISEIDO 7. RED EARTH (LipGloss) 8. CHANEL (Lip Conditioner) 9. MARKET AMERICA-MOTNES LIPSTICK.  The higher the lead content, the greater the chance of causing cancer.   After doing a test on lipsticks, it was found that the Y.S.L. lipstick contained the most amount of lead.    Watch out for those lipsticks which are supposed to stay longer. If your lipstick stays longer, it is because of the higher content of lead. Here is a test you can do yourself:  1. Put some lipstick on your hand. 2. Use a Gold ring to scratch on the lipstick. 3. If the lipstick color changes to black, then you know the lipstick contains lead. Please send this information to all your girlfriends, wives and female family members. This information is being circulated at Walter Reed Army Medical Center . Dioxin Carcinogens cause cancer, especially breast cancer",
