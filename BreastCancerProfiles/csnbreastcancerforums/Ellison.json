      "Content": "Hummingbyrd, I am ever so greatful for any old or new information about treatments. Also,I can appreciate all the support I get when I am having a come apart day. This is what being a SURVIVOR of this disease is all about... Taking responsibility for oneself... Participating in our own recovery. Having connectons with other survivors is part of the journey. I participate in other sites for stage 4 survivors and some of the posters have some absolutely great information about old treatments and new ones. Honestly, since I have been on this site, I don't know many that are stage 4. That is why I post on other sites. I do enjoy this site very much. It is not always about me but giving back. I think they are making a BIG mistake! If it gets to the point that I have to be afried to ask a question, or share about a treatment, I don't have time for it... I need the freedom of being able to have the whole picture in order for me to get through this disease one day at a time. I have had enough taken away from me. We are all just trying to survive the best way we know. We have to stick together in how we feel and what we know about this disease as long as it is morally and legally correct...",

I was just fasinated by all of it.. In fact my husband and I got married at a Little Chapel over there. That was 30 yrs ago. Right now you don't feel physically storng but maybe between now and then will make a world of difference for you. Hope you get to have the experience. There is much to do and see. I have not been there in years. I hear the changes are something awsome. One of my coworkers and her husband went to Vegas quite frequently.. They stayed at the Balagio (spelling not correct..) They went more for the RR. She would read a book and ring for room service during the day, at night they would go out for awhile when it cooled off. Slow is good! In fact it is better especially over there. Time flies when your having fun. I don't know about you but my body lets me know when it is time to rest.. I don't fight it much anymore... Take care Ellison",

      "Content": "Hi all, I have been reading your e-mails trying to find out if anyone is feeling what I am feeling. I have chronic pain in my feet. It gets worst at night. When I get up to go to the bathroom I have to wear socks and slippers. Bearfoot days are definitely over. I go to the store get what I need and home again. I forgot to mention, I also had 6 Adriamicin/Cytoxin treatments every 21 days and something else was in the mix.. and 33 radiation treatments. This was for a lump removed, no cancer in my lympnodes. Now almost a year out, I started having pain in my right knee, right hip joint and hip around the middle of my back. I had xrays of the hip, blood work and a bone scan last week. My oncologist called me two days later and said she did not like what she sees. I still don't know what she sees she does not like. Just hearing her voice when she called me at work put me in a spin. She said the pain on my right side and my feet is arthritis. What she sees that she does not like is on my left side. Go figure... She ordered 4 xrays of my brain, xrayed my pelvic and back. Took more blood. Needless to say I had to feel sorry for myself, a little scared you know... She told me the morning she called, if you don't hear from me by next week just keep your Oct appt. After I finally took charge of my self, I called her office on Tuesday asked the nurse if she ordered those xrays and blood stat. If not I was told I have to wait 10 days before any results. I let her know I had a bad holiday weekend. Had the funeral planned and all that, I am sure none of you have ever done that... I am still waiting for the results... I just know right now today I do not want to do chemo and I don't want to take tomoxafin. Tomorrow I might think different. I don't feel physically and mentally ready to do it again.. If it didn't work the first time what makes me think it will work this time... I thought maybe some other alternatives.. Anyway I don't even know what it is yet... Thank you for listening...",

      "Content": "Sorry your mother is having a hard time with the treatment. I have stage IV breast cancer/matasised to the bones. Not in organs at this time. First time for treatment was in 2003. I had a lumpoctomy with no cancer in nodes. Had strong chemo coctail combination. 5FU/citoxin/Adrimisan (spelling is off on the last one) Also 33 radiation treatments. I finished chemo and radiation the end of Oct 03. Was diagnosed with bone mets in Oct 04. I am doing Toxal and Avastin. I do three weeks on and one off. I get Toxal and Avastin the first and third week and Toxal on the second week. My experience was low blood count and they had to lower the Toxal 20%. Everything else drops. I think it would be a good idea to see if you can put a call into the doctor about the side effect. It would probably put your mind at ease. Good luck and keep posting to let us know how your mother is doing. It is always a choice to do treatment or not. It takes a lot of thought and courage to make these choices. I can't tell you how many times I have thought about this myself. Also, this has to be so hard on you. I know it has been on my husband and family. So much fear and stress and anxiety goes along with this. Your mother is so lucky to have such a caring and loving daughter. elli",
