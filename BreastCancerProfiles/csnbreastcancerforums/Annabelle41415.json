    "Content": "Hi all.  Well my biopsy was today and of course being scared just didn't have too many questions.  They got me into position up on a table - felt like I'm up there for an oil change or something.  Just didn't expect to be hoisted up on a table.  They tried to get some pictures and said they were taking smaller images of the area.  Couldn't really hear what they were saying as a nurse was talking to me trying to keep me calm - of course, I'm already crying.  They tried again and heard them say that it's just too close.  After about 20 minutes of repositioning and tugging they gave up because it was too close to the breast bone and not enough tissue.  They said that the needle would go through the breast completely.  I'm not sure how this works but I'd think that they would be able to control the amount it goes in but obviously not.  I'm now more upset because I've opted to get this biopsy out of the way to get an answer and it's a failure.    They now tell me that after looking at these new pictures today it looks like an injury from the breast implant removal and the tissue has developed calcification spots but they didn't look that suspicious but they still want to monitor them.  Now they say to wait another 6 months for a mammogram to wait and see.  I'm furious as I've elected to get this biopsy to forgo that wait and see.   I've got a call in to a breast surgeon on May 17 and want him to take a look at the scans and see if he feels that me having a \"old fashioned biopsy surgery\" would be warranted.  I'm electing for this but not sure as I'm not really wanting another surgery.  If he says he doesn't feel it's necessary this will be this third doctor telling me this.  Now I'm angry though because me going there was to get an answer and now I've come back with more questions.   If this new surgeon says he'll do it but it's outpatient surgery now, would you go ahead and do it just to keep your mind clear that it's nothing.  I'm thinking why should a 6 month scan do if it's grown in that time when there could have been something done 6 months earlier.   Your thoughts and suggestions are welcome.  Thank you for any comments.   Kim  ",
