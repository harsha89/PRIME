      "Content": "my scalp became sensitive after the first chemo treatment - i was told i would lose my hair within two weeks. sure enough, i was finding long red hair EVERYWHERE! on the 12th day, i went to wash my hair and about two-thirds of my hair was in my hands! i freaked (just a little) then went and had my head shaved. i asked to be turned away from the mirror, could not bear to watch, but after i was turned to the mirror i cried a bit - but mostly because i looked just like my dad before he died. i have finished chemo and am preparing for mastectomy, and there are still those stubborn hairs on my head that never fell out - but no new growth. i only wear my wig to work (elementary school) and to church. i am amazed at how it doesn't bother me to be bald!",
