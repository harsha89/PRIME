Stay strong and try to engage in activities that you truly enjoy. It's ok to have down time, the important thing to know is that if it is something you've caught it and can do something about it. Stay away from any negative energy. Stay Well, will pray for you! Hugs, Jenn",

The news is discouraging, after being originally diagnosed with DCIS, the doctors have now realized that 5% of my lession consisted of invasive ductal carcinoma. I will have to have a lymph node biopsy on the 20th of this month. I'm very scared, HELP!!!!! Hugs, Jennifer",

      "Content": "Hey Girls, I'm back...sorry I've been away so long, I an happy to report I am in remission and just needed a break from all the cancer related things in my life. I've been in remission now for a year and am feeling great. My last biopsy was in Feb of this year, but it was clear thank God!!!!!!!!. I have gone back to law school and am just in the brink of getting my degree in May. I also met a very special man and will be getting married next August. Also I am involved as a volunteer at my cancer center, it is a really great experience. I hope all you gals are doing great. You have all been in my prayers this whole time. Hope to hear from you and if you can bring me up to speed. Oh, if I can be of help to anyone, please let me know. Love Always, Jenn",
