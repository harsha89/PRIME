      "Content": "I was advised to take 600 - 800 mg twice a day, but I only tolerated the morning dose.  However, I still had rapid improvement (within several weeks).  Lyrica was going to me the next step, and I never had to go there.  I still have some residual neuropathy, but it is minimal.  My chemo was different from yours, however, as I had it for a colorectal cancer (Appendix Cancer.) I hope that this helps.",
