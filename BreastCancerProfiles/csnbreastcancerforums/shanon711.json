    "Content": "Relay for Life, the American Cancer Society\u2019s signature activity is an amazing community event that celebrates cancer survivors and remembers those we have lost, while raising money to fight cancer. Remember why we relay \u2013 Relay for Life represents the HOPE that those lost to cancer will never be forgotten, that those who face cancer will be supported, and that one day cancer will be eliminated! HOPE is a beautiful word! Honor, Opportunity, Provide and Engage are the paths to reach and accomplish our mission. Until a cure is found, the only way I know how to fight, how to get my voice heard, and how to contribute to my community and The American Cancer Society and make a difference is to participate in the Relay for Life. That is why I have committed myself to the ACS\u2019s Relay For Life Survivors team Chairperson. We have something in common. I\u2019ve experienced firsthand what it is like to hear the words \u201cYou have Cancer\u201d. I know firsthand what it is like to have to tell your family and friends that you have been diagnosed with cancer. I also recall what it is like to wake up day after day forcing yourself to go to your chemotherapy and/or radiation treatments. However, I also remember, like it was yesterday, the words \u201cyou are in remission\u201d. Just like you, I am a survivor! I was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 24. I underwent a lumpectomy with chemotherapy and radiation treatments. At my five year remission mark, I was diagnosed with breast cancer again! This time I underwent a double mastectomy with immediate reconstructive surgery involving a stomach tram, and more chemotherapy treatments. I am happy to say that I am ten years in remission with a wonderful husband of 16 years and two beautiful daughters ages 12 and 5. Congratulations to each and every one of you for fighting a battle and winning. I would like to personally invite you to our Relay for Life Kickoff Party on October 20th, 2009 at Wesley Chapel Elementary School, 30243 Wells Road, Wesley Chapel, FL 33543 in the cafeteria. We would be honored, if you are interested in walking in the survivor lap, or participating in the Relay for Life, or would like more information on joining a team or a committee or just want to come out and meet some really nice people, then come on out to our Kickoff Party starting at 6:30pm. Either way, I would love to hear from you so please email me and introduce yourself. Thank you in advance for your support. Should you have any questions regarding the American Cancer Society or Relay for Life, please feel free to contact Stephanie Watts, ACS Staff Partner, at (813) 949-0291 Ext. 107 or email Stephanie.watts@cancer.org. or Shanon Weiss, Survivor Chairperson Relay For Life wcsurvivorchair@yahoo.com Thank you!
