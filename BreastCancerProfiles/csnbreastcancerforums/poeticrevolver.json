    "Content": "Wow, I am so very sorry for what you are going through right now,and ever since your diagnosis of leukemia. Cancer does suck! Sorry, I just get mad because I too have more than one cancer. First it was Hodgkin's Lymphoma, then breast cancer. Now, I go tomorrow for a breast biopsy , looks like a recurrence. Not so good. Also, a new, very large lymph node showed up. Breast surgeon said it might be the lymphoma coming back, so soon?? I just finished chemo about one month ago for hodgkins. 27 weeks of it. It was terrible. However, I made it through. Look at what you have been through. I don't know all the details, but it must have been so difficult without help. I have three children. 15, 13, and 10. This has been very hard on them. I make sure to talk with them whenever they want to. I want them to be involved, and not feel left out or scared. If you have gotten through all of what you already have, sounds like this , even though unwanted, will be doable. I know you can do it. It's actually , from what I'm learning , quite common for a cancer patient to get a secondary cancer. I know it is not fun, at all. Loosing our hair, gaining weight from the steroids, the mood swings, the crying, the severe pain. I know. I am here for you, and I will be praying for you, especially for the Lord to send some help your way. Someone who will reach out to you, and help get you through this bump in the road. You are a survivor! God bless you, J",
