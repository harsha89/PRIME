I find that many times people say the wrong thing due to their own fear of cancer.  Others just have no idea what to say.   If you can take someone with you to each appt along with a notebook and pen - it's a great idea.   You get so much info at once that it's hard to keep it straight.  Write down any questions you think of in between appts and take them with you.   Ask each and everyone and make sure you get an answer you fully understand",

      "Content": "So sorry to hear what you've been through.      My sister had a lot of trouble after her bilateral - mainly on the left side.  After several additional surgeries, taking the expander out, waiting, putting it back in, etc. it was determined that it was the initial expander.   She had an infection the entire time.   They were finally able to remove all the affected tissue, get rid of the infection, heal up and she now has her permanent implants - but it was a long journey.   Hang in there.   My plastic surgeon has been great.  I have been fortunate to not have complications after my bilateral and then placement of the implants.  One thing that he did that my sister's surgeon didn't was to keep me overnight to administer boatloads of antibiotics.  If I had to go to the dentist he had me start antibiotics before I went.   And if I have heard it once I've heard it a 1000 times -lotion, lotion, lotion especially on the radiated side.   Don't hesitate to ask for help with depression.   I am on 3 antidepressants and have been for quite a while.  It has kept me sane while dealing with cancer, my son's head injury, having to move.",
