      "Content": "was a candidate for a lumpectomy.. but I chose to do a bi-lateral with immediate reconstruction using the tummy tissue. I also am happy with my choice. When my journey first started I had the thought of both.. but was so back and forth about it... I talked to my plastic surgeon and another trusted oncology nurse. They both listened to my arguments on doing both sides vs just one. (I knew I didn't want a lumpectomy).. this is what they said to me... My argument was I didn't want to take advantage of my situation and felt like I was being vain by doing both and coming out a bigger size... I would have never had augumentation.. So the oncology nurse said.. Listen I feel your leaning more toward both becasue of this and this.. So what you do is Make your decision STICK TO IT and LET IT GO!!! The plastic surgeon said \"hey why not do both.. may as well get something out of having cancer...\" I should say some of my fears were the worry of it coming back in the other breast and going through it all over again. and I didn't want to do radiation... I also thought about that I now have the insurance and what If I didn't have it in the future if it came back. I would have the same costs again and same surgery only would have to use implant.. plus using the tummy is a one shot deal... so tummy tuck + 2 bigger breasts = fabulous new body... well at least to me and that's all that counts!!! Me and my peace of mind!!! It is such a personal decision... and all of us on here have been where you are!!!",
