    "Content": "HI I got neulasta with each of my chemo treatments in 2004,I would get body aches for about a day and then it would go away , also with each dose the side effects were not as bad. I hope and pray that this will be easier for you. Ask your Dr. if there are any pain meds you can take ?? Best of luck ps- I am also new to this board , what a great way to conncet with others going thru similar problems. Bonnie T.",
