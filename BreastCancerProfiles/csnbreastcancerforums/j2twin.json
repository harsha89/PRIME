    "Content": "My score was 15. On arimidex for 5 years ER+ PR-Her2_nodes negative. I was told I could do chemo but it would only drop it anywher between 1-3%. I choose not to do chemo and did radiation. Yes sometimes I feel nervous I'm not doing enough. But I'm sticking with my decision. If you feel nervous get a second oponion it never hurts. Good luck",
