    "Content": "Well it all depends on your husband. I'll give you a example. I asked my wife to marry me at the recovering room after her surgery . She had breast cancer. She did not want me to suffer the pain with her, and she wanted me to leave. Well I married her in 96 untill her passing in 04. It's your future husband will decide weather he can prove if he loves you or not. This is a tuff issue, a hard one I may add. As for cancer groups i'm sure it will help you, but as for my experience, it just bring back bad memories...Hope this help Friend ripJoAn...",
