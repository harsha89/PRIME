    "Content": "Hello friends. I ususally post on the Uterine Cancer board; I am finishing chemo for my second recurrence of endometroid adenocarcinoma (nodules in the lung).  I had screening and diagnostic mammograms in the last several days and the result of yesterday's 3D imagining and ultrasound was a conclusion that I should have a non-surgical stereotactic-guided needle biopsy of tissue containing many more calcifications than last seen in 2015.  I haven't yet spoken to my gyne oncologist about his view; I will see him tomorrow before my final chemo treatment (which is going okay; the lung nodules have been shrinking or disappearing from CT view, but there is a new unknown--a small soft tissue lesion in my right groin area--that we were going to check out when I have a post-chemo PET/CT in late September). My question is, what is your collected wisdom?  Is this something a breast surgeon should do?  My cancer hospital breast cancer has set me up with a board-certified diagnostic radiologist for the procedure.  I would not consent to anything more than a biopsy at this point until I know where I am with the endometrial cancer.  The radiologist yesterday told me there are no masses in the breasts and if this does turn out to be cancer, it is early stage and likely would be treated with lumpectomy and radiation.  So, based on your collective histories and experiences, how do you ladies recommend I proceed to obtain a reliable biopsy?  Thanks for any insight.  Best wishes, Oldbeauty",
