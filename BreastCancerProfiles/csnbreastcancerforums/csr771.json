      "Content": "I never rode on the Pink Bus, but I'd like to come. It is hot here in Pittsburgh. I can only go if there is air conditioning on the bus because the tamoxifin makes me prone to hot flashes. Can someone save me a seat in the back. I want to be with the loud and laughing people. Is anyone bringing Pepsi or other soft drinks. I will go and get the cooler ready. What time should I be ready?",

      "Content": "My onco said that I had a 10% chance of recurrence in the next 10 years. Chemo would reduce that by 1-2%. He said that if I was a family member he would not recommend chemo. I opted not to do chemo. I started Arimidex, but was instructed to stop taking it as it was more than likely exacerbating my arthritis. Will probably start a new medication in the next week or so. I am 57. There are many things to consider when making decisions about our health. Everything has to be considered and we have to utimately decide what's best for us.",

      "Content": "Sparky, it's all about you! I agree with the posters that say \"GET NEW DOCTORS.\" It is easy to get burned out. It is physically/mentally/emototionally stressful to have health issues. One of the things I prayed for as I started this journey was competent and caring health professionals from the surgeons to nursing assistants. As patients, we are dependent on medical people. We have to trust that they are knowledgeable and will do what is in the best interest of the patient. This doesn't always happen. We have to fight for ourselves and if we are too weak to do it, then someone has to do it for us. Don't give up---get busy finding yourself competent healthcare professionals. To me, neither doctor is proactive and you are the one that is suffering.",
