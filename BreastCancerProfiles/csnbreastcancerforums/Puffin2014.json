      "Content": "Lew's funeral was yesterday, I lost count how many floral arrangements there were - 7 Peace Lilies alone. No way do I have room in my little house for all the flowers so sent bouquets home with any family who would take them, and I still have 10 left here in my house. So many people came they had to open up the back wall of the chapel and have people standing in the vestibute for the service. The minister did a wonderful job, not too \"preachy\" and not long winded. He allowed time for people to come up and tell stories . I knew if I didn't get up right away I wouldn't be able to. I kept telling myself all day \"I am strong, I can do this\", and I did. I consciously drew in energy from everybody I hugged. Had a few teary episodes throughout the day, but avoided the total meltdown. I was so afraid I'd totally lose it and go into the ugly cry like I've done at home when I'm alone. Also knew it would be so much harder for his kids and grandkids if I was bawling my eyes out. But that takes a lot of energy and by the time I got home last night I was totally drained. This morning we took Lew's oldest son's family to the cemetery to see the columbarium where Lew's ashes will be placed when the plaque arrives in a couple months. He'll be on the southeast corner and the morning sun just makes that whole side sparkle. Ed and Dad just headed for home, I have 2 more Peace Lilies to give away, going to visit my friend who lives in assisted living this afternoon, she says there is a common living area by her room where I can put them. Then I'm going to start going through the huge stack of cards from yesterday, and I suppose start writing thank you cards.",

There's usually not much activity on chat during the day, but is active between 9 and midnight central time. Be careful about jumping all over the internet, a lot of incorrect and scary stuff out there. Another website that my onc recommended was breastcancer.org and I have found it extremely helpful. Besides having excellent educational articles, their discussion forums are subdivided, so you can follow forums specifically for those who have had mastectomies, chemo, radiation, etc. I started with the lumpectomy forum, then moved to the chemo forum, then the radiation forum, and now am active on the Arimidex forum. Be sure and mark any forum you like as a favorite so it's easy to find again and easy to see when new responses have been added. Another suggestion I'd have is to ask your Dr if it's OK that you record your appointments with your smart phone/iPod. They cover so much info it's hard to take it all in, and even having a second person with you isn't always the answer. Lew wasn't very good at taking notes. It was several months between my first visit with the radiologist and when I finally started radiation, and it was so helpful to go back and relisten to that first session.",

I know treatment options are limited with triple negative and thought all triple neg got chemo. I haven't heard about a tumor having to be a certain size before chemo was effective, though I know it's also supposed to work better on cells that are rapidly growing and maybe the line of thought is that if it's a tiny tumor it's not made up of rapidly growing cells. Triple neg has such a high reoccurence rate I think I'd go for the chemo and take my chances with the chemo. Chemo is no picnic, but it's do-able. Drs have good meds for side effects, I had no trouble with nausea or vomiting, fatigue and muscle weakness were my major problems. My last chemo was Sep 18 and I'm back to my normal strength now. Also check out www.breastcancer.org for information. It's a site my onc recommended as having reputable info. It has excellent educational information and has an extensive list of topic specific discussion forums. Check out their triple negative forums and see if anyone there can provide any answers. Good luck in your search for answers and keep us informed how you're doing.",

I got very weak from my chemo, foggy thinking for awhile, food lost its taste and of course, lost my hair.

My scalp has enough hair that it looks like a 5 o'clock shadow on my head; I got a free wig from the American Cancer Society that looks so much like my original hair that people told me I looked better while on chemo.   Whatever you decide, make sure you'll be able to look back with no regrets, no second guessing.",

It's scored from 0-100, a score of under 10 means no chemo indicated, a score of 30 or more means chemo definitely would be helpful, and scores in the grey area are discussed with oncologist. My score was 27 so there wasn't much discussion. You also get a graph with the score that tells your percent chance of the cancer reocurring with and without chemo",
