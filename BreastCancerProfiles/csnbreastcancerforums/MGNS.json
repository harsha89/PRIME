      "Content": "My oncologist switched me from Femara to Letrozole and the main side effect for both meds has been weight gain. I've gained between 25-30 lbs. and hate being so big. But I just keep telling myself that I've got one year down and only four more of this medication and then I can get back to my comfortable weight. I haven't noticed depression since I'm already on Lexapro for several years. Despite the negative of weight gain, I'm thankful for the positive of clean reports every four months! The only positive of weight gain is I've gotten to buy a new wardrobe!!!",
