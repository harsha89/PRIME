      "Content": "I am really beginning to be deeply concerned! I had a lumpectomy and removal of 12 lymph glands, with only 1 malignant, in Nov. 2009. Have been seen regularly by my surgeon, Oncologist, Radiologist. In fact, just finished chemo the 10th of March. Was supposed to start radiation soon after, but Onc. and Radiolgist questioning the redness and swelling in my breast, and around toward my back.. Surgeon says it's scar tissue and lymphadema, have been on 2 regimens of antib. just in case it might be infection. No changes. Swelling is still there, along with the redness. Went for follow up mammogram and ultra sound. They found no evidence of a tumor , but the ultra sound shows alot of thickening of breast tissue..They're still thinking it is probably lymph fluid draining too slowly, and scar tissue. Radiation has been put on hold again, and I am being sent to rehab therapy for deep massage to hopefully get the fluids moving. Has this ever happened to any of you?",

      "Content": "Wow! Just when I think I'm getting better at accepting this fight, here I am again crying! Hate these feelings. Just had my second chemo Wednesday. I'm half-way there now. Doing okay, no nausea, etc. But when I look at my breast and feel it (had a lumpectomy in Nov.2009) my entire breast is hard, and the nipple is still inverted. It wasn't inverted before the surgery.. I'm just scared the cancer has returned! When I asked my surgeon about it a month after surgery, he said it was scar tissue, and to not worry about it.I have to go back for my check-up with him Monday, and I'm going to ask him about it again. I guess that's why I'm feeling so scared today. What is he going to tell me? Has anyone else experienced this hardness and inverted nipple after a lumpectomy?",
