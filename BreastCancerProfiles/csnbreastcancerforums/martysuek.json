    "Content": "I had bilateral mast 2/10/10 for cancer contained to the breast. I had sentinal node biopsy. Just one node removed. I didn't have rad or chemo. Now I'm having troubles with lymphedema! I was so shocked. I did all the right things and the chances were so slim, like 5%. Anyway, that's enough whining. I'm wearing a sleeve and doing manual drainage 2 times daily, but am having problems with shoulder swelling. Anyone have an idea for shoulder compression? Something that will not be noticable under cloths and something that will not squish the expander I'm having put in 3/18/10? Thanks for your input!",
