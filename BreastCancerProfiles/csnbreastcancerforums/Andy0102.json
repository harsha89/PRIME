    "Content": "Hi...so sorry you are having to go through all that. I just had a port put in a week ago. It wasn't my choice but nurse had hit a nerve in my hand and now it can't be used. I do love the port though. I was very scared to get it but my fears were unfounded. Yes you know it's there but it's not like it hurts or anything. You can sleep, shower etc just like normal. I hope this helps. Best of luck Hugs Andy",
