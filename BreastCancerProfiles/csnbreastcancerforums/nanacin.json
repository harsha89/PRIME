    "Content": "I have had diabetes for 46 years Type 1). Was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer with lymph node involvement last Sept. I had a lumpectory and lymph nods removal and am to have 16 chemo treatments. I am half way thru chemo and controling my diabetes is extremely hard for a couple of days. I am constantly working with my doctor trying to find the best insulin adjustment. My insulin requirement of Novolog have doubles/triples on these two days and I have had constant infections while on chemo. BUT, they are all treatable and I am grateful for where I am at in my treatment. I will also have 30 radiation treatments when chemo is over. It is a long haul.",
