      "Content": "LOL - thanks for that.  Sorry - I just found this reply.   But to share the whole story - my friend's sister was given 33% to live after having chemo and radiation for lung cancer.  My friend and her sister were having lunch (this year), and a man came to their table that was a pastor, and asked the sister if she had cancer.  She said yes, and he said all of his family members had had cancer and that if she would grind up some apricot seeds and eat them in her meals her cancer would go away.  Well, I was shocked to say the least, but her sister did so immediately and is now cancer free. When we found this out about my mom I shared with her immediately, and she started to eat them.  After the first chemo tx - the dr. said her lump was softer and smaller.  I know this can be due to the chemo obviously, but I truly have a peace about it.  Since that time, my mom has been \"scared\" by oher folks not to do this, and that is fine.   I've given her some research and she said she will pray about it, but at this time has a peace without them.  So that's good.  I'm just hear to support in whatever decision she makes.  It's got to be her decision.   Thanks for your quick replys.  You have been a great encouragement to me, and others.  Have a great rest of the week.    ",
