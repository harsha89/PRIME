      "Content": "I've been thinking of you, so glad you posted an update!! I'm glad the vitB injection helped with your energy level....I had them every 2 weeks for a while and the only thing it did was give me a bad headache within 15-20 mins, no increased energy level...I started drinking protein type slushy drinks, like Odwalla or Naked brand and taking vit gummy B....It did seem to help......As I've posted before, antidepressants have helped me tremendously..You said they won't change how you feel, but they kind of did for me. But of course you only do what you feel comfortable with. Please talk to your dr. because there are so many different ones available nowadays... I'm praying and thinking of you! Joyce",

Go on a shopping spree with kids and husband and buy whatever we want! Win more than $5 on a scratch ticket! Help those that need help, shut-ins, the hungry, the homeless, cancer patients. Do what I can for my community. Spot a bad guy from America's most Wanted and \"make the call\" LOL I know sounds funny, but it's true!! Be able to somehow pay back my wonderful husband who has done sooooo much for me during this cancer journey!! God's peace,health, and happiness for my wonderful kids,husband and family! Joyce",
