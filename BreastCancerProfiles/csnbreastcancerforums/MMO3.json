      "Content": "Hello everybody..first off~~ God bless and prayers to EVERY single one of my soon to be Pink lady friends. I have been silently reading and watching discussions grow (old & new) since the day i joined this website shortly after being diagnosed myself. I just have to say the tears I have shed out of sadness and joy are tears of beauty in an all around sort of way> YOU all have touched me so with all of your heart felt genuine words of unconditional love and support to one another. What a wonderful support family within itself..Thank you for advice and sharing your knowledge with positive energy. I learn as I read so I can know what to expect in my upcoming days. Love to all, Another Pink lady friend :)",
