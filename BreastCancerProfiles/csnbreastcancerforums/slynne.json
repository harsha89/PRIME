I went to my Dr. on Friday and complained that she hadn't told me about the effects of Taxol - she said not everyone gets them. I looked at her and said Well I got them and it was awful. When asked what I wanted - I told her I wanted some medication that would help and I wanted the perscription NOW - I wasn't going to wait till 8 hours after the pain started like last time. I told her about the problems I had with my eyes and she acknowledged that side effect too. After reading the posts here I went to her armed with notes and information - think I surprised her. I learned we need to be our own patient advocates - and I did it with the help of all of you! Have my 2nd Taxol on Friday - hope the percoset helps! luv to all Susan",

      "Content": "Hi, I just got back from my Dr. - we had a long talk about my cancer and the treatments I have received. To make a long story short - tomorrow is my LAST Taxol!!! There are no words to describe how I feel right now! I only have to do this one more time! Radiation will start early July. Then she said something that surprised me. She said I should consider myself cancer free. Oh how I want to believe that! Can't believe I've gotten this far.... thanks to you all for helping me.. I have a ways to go I know that but I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. Thanks again for all your prayers...Susan",
