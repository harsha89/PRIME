    "Content": "3 Taxol down, 1 to go...YES!!! Chemo is almost over, I can't wait. This has truely been a challenge for me...I would not have thought in my wildest dream that I would be going throug chemo and radiation for breast cancer. Well, they're all here and I'm dealing with it. I'm trying to get to the point where some of you brave, courageous & strong ladies are...but that may take a while. I am happy that I found this site. Every since my first submission to the board, I have found a lot of good information and an abundance of support. Even though you don't know me you care about little ole me. That's more than I can say about most of my family members. I haven't spoken to 50% since being diagnosed, but I'm fine with that. I have support through you, 2 co workers (one MAKES me get out of the house every other Friday), my boyfriend and my WONDERFUL MOM who has went to every treatment with me. So I wishing and praying that this time around my body doesn't ache as bad as the firwt two treatments. Maybe I will start taking the pain med the morning of the 3rd day, instead of waiting for it to come:) And I plan to get me some sort of alcoholic drink after my 4th treatment!!",
