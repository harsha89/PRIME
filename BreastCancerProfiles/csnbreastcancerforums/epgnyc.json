      "Content": "A lump was discovered and I had a mammogram and ultrasound the same day, as you did. They came out after reading both tests (it did take them an hour or two to get the results for both tests) and I was told it looked like \"something\" and that they needed to do a needle biopsy, which they did right then. I was then told 2 days later that it was positive for cancer. I really don't see why they couldn't give you the answer the same day. If some places can do it, then every place can do it. It's just that some hospitals and/or radiology centers don't work that way. I once went to a place and they informed you of the results 2-3 days later. Needless to say, I never went back there again. I don't see why women need to wait - anxiously, painfully wait - when there is no real reason other than \"policy.\" I agree with the others who said you should keep calling them to get the answers you need ASAP. I also think it's probably good news that they don't seem alarmed. Good luck to you!",

      "Content": "Hi there. I finished my 6 1/2 weeks of radiation in March of this year. Although I'm only a 34C I'm extremely fair skinned and I think that's why I reacted poorly to radiation. I couldn't wear a regular bra for 6 months afterwards and the entire left side of my breast felt burned to a crisp, just the way it would after a bad sunburn - stinging, hot, lots of discomfort. I used aloe 3x day for those 6 months. And low and behold after 7 months, things started to go back to normal. I can now wear a regular bra (although still not an underwire) and I don't have that burning sensation anymore. Like everyone says, it's just a matter of time. We all heal at our own rate and yours will improve with time too. Hang in there....it does end! Good luck.",

      "Content": "It sounds like your appointment went well and that you now have lots more information than you did. The sentinel node biopsy will, of course, give you the very important information about your lymph nodes. Good luck with that. My cancer was similar to yours, although mine was larger at 1.7 centimaters. I very luckily did not have any lymph node involvement, but mine was the most aggressive Grade III and I too am estrogen and progestron receptor negative. Receptor negative cancer does have a less good prognosis than receptor positive cancer. They're not exactly sure why but much of it probably has to do with the fact that we are not able to take the hormone drugs that cut down so much on future recurrence. So join the ER negative crowd. They're now doing research on therapies for our type of cancer, which is good news. Again, wishing you good luck with the node biopsy. By the way, I found it to be a really simple procedure so don't worry. Ellen",
