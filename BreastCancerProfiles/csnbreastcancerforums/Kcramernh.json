      "Content": "i took tamoxifen for over a year until I was switched to arimidex.  I gained over 25 pounds and as we all know it is very hard to lose weight while on chemo drugs.  I recently found a nutritional program that has gotten rid of my really bad headaches, I have lost 10 pounds and over 28 inches over all, all in a short period of time.   If anyone is seriously interested please contact me.  My email is kcramernh@comcast.net or on Facebook Kathy Howard Cramer  .  I know how hard it is to live with being a cancer survivor, the weight gain and worrying about a recurrence.  They say the heavier you are your chances are higher.  I finally found something to help me release weight and feel better and I want to share and help fellow cancer survivors.",
