      "Content": "Hi Kiki Taxol was alot easier for me than A/C. But having my livwer removed with a spoon would have been easier for me than A/C. I didn't have the blood count issues and wasn't nearly as fatigued. But we all react differently. On taxol turned out to be a fingernail slayer for me. Right now my fingers are all taped up because the old nail is very close to falling off, but attached just enough that I am not quite ready to let them go. More a pain in the donkey than anything. I didn't finish all of my taxol because my fingers and toes became numb, and the onc was concerned if I continued I may not recover feeling in them. Taxol did make me feel achy and a bit queasy. Kind of like I had the flu. I also seemed to lose some of my taste buds. Could taste a little, but not like I can now. I have read some posts where people breeze through A/C and struggle with taxol. I hope you breeze through taxol. What's the plan after taxol. Are you HER2+? Sharon",

      "Content": "Like you I had AC follwoed by taxol (taxotare). Don't know if that's is what is doing it, but I also cannot stop eating. As soon as I eat something for breakfast so I can take my morining pills, I am thinking of what might be for lunch. I have an insatiable sweet tooth. I used to never buy candy for myself. Now I haunt the candy aisles and have been grabbing all the Eastser goodies on sale. I have been known to consume a whole bag of chocolate chips in a day. I wolf down my food like I am starving. It used to be that when eating out, we would ask for my food first because even when starting first, I would still finish last. (I was a very slow eater. I nibbled at everything. savoring each bite, chew chew chew) Now I am keeping up with the rest of the crowd. My eating habits have changed drastically. And not for the good. I was attributing it to the anti-depressants I was heavily dosed on durring chemo. Thought maybe I was just getting so relaxed that I was enjoying food where before I might have been just too wound up. Do I need a psych? I sure would like to know what is going on. I mentioned it to my onc that I was becoming ravenous over food, and was it something to do with chemo? He seemed to just pass it off. If I have been reading him right, he doesn't have a clue what this means, and hasn't heard of it being linked to chemo. AAARGGGGH! So who else do you ask? This did not neccessarily become a problen while I was on Taxol. Some of my taste buds came back then and I started enjoying eating again, but I am going way over the limit. I wish someone would explain this to me so I had a clue how to combat it. All I know is that I crave food, when before dx, it was just something I had to do to take care of myself. And before chemo I never really craved sweets, and now they are a food group. Someone please help!",

Onc says they give it to try and thwart any allergic reaction I could have from the herceptin. They also give my boyfriend benadryl before his chemo. (throat cancer) I'm going to have to ask now if they just automatically give everyone a dose of benadryl before treatment. Sharon",

      "Content": "Welcome Pink, Chemo was hard for me too. I was so fatigued and depressed I could barely stand myself. But when my son would come home from school (he is in college, living with me so he can afford to concentrate on his education) and ask what I needed, the love and concern he showed seemed to make me feel very proud of him and I was glad we had a time when I was the weak one, and he could be the one who doing for me. It was a growing experience for the both of us. I could see the reward you get when you do for others. Sometimes it is our turn to be done for instead of doing for others. You will feel better, I promise. In the mean time tell your oncologist how you are feeling. There is no shame is using pain medications. Make yourself as comfortable as possible and rest all you can. It sounds like you have alot of good people around you. They probably are honored to be your blessing at this trying time.",

      "Content": "Hey Go Blue - I think you have a right to complain on this! You are going through a life changing experience. It should have some effect on your outlook and mood. And you should be able to find support and understanding from the people closest to you. That would be a perfect world. All of us want to live in a perfect world; you, and your husband. Your world, and his, are not perfect anymore. It sucks for sure. But hopefully you both will find a way through this. He needs to realize what your reality is, and you need to realize what his reality is. (Reality can suck too!) But you will get through this, and so will he. And it sucks doubly that you will need to bend to his reality, when you most need comfort and support. I am pretty sure your bc has scared the livin' bejezus out out of him. What would you be thinking if he had come to you with the \"Big-C?\" You both are going through the wringer, but probably different wringers. I don't know your boyfriend, and I don't know you, but I do know that news like this has a profound affect on people. I remember telling my \"close\" people the news. I tried to be all big and strong. I could get through all this, and I will. But somewhere along the way you will need someone to say \"it will be allright\". Apparantly your husband doesn't feel like everything will \"be allright.\" He is having issues with your being ill. And he may not feel like it is okay for him to have those \"issues\". You got one of those MEN that have a hard time connecting happenings to actions. (i.e. my wife is ill, and I should take a certain action.) Or else he is just a self centered egomaniac that just doesn't give a poop about anything but his own well being. That is your call to make. No matter what your call, you can depend on the sisters here to give you support and comfort the best we can. But we cannot substitute for your husband. You didn't cook breakfast, and that is an okay issue for an arguement? Sorry, but if I don't feel like cooking breakfast - it just doesn't get cooked. I am not a B**** about it, but sorry, I am trying to battle cancer, and if I don't feel the energy to jump up and cook breakfast - the world around me will live with that. I might crawl out to fridge and grab a yogurt, but hey - feeding capable people who can get their own breakfast isn't going to bring me off my sick bed. If anything, they should be asking me what I might need. And fortunately I have people around me that feel the same way. Sorry, but your husband doesn't sound very supportive in your life. Or else he is battling demons of his own about it. I feel very sad about your predicament. You deserve to have loving and supportive people close to your in this journey. You didn't say what your dx was. Will you have to go through chemo? Radiation? Mastectomy or lumpectomy? Do you have other family close? Sure, people get \"undies in a bundle\" when someone has cancer. I used to also. But the ability to adapt to changing situations is a sign of maturity. (NOT GETTING OLD - Maturity!) You both will need to adapt to a changing situation. The journey can be full of unexpected turns and twists. If you both are going to make it through, you both have to get on the same path. It won't be your path, and it won't be his path, it will be a path you both choose. You won't find it without him, and he won't find the path without you. You have to find this path together. Geeze, ain't I corny sometimes! GoBlue, I wish you all the best. My heart goes out to you, I also know how devastating it can be to have your husband ignore your needs. Just hang in there Blue Girl! Keep on a' posting to this discussion. You will get through. Hugs - Sharon",
