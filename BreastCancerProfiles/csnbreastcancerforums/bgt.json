    "Content": "Hi, I had severe neuropathy is both hands and feet from chemotheraphy. Fortunately, the neuropathy left my hands after about 6months. My feet have taken longer. It is as if it is workingÂ  its way down my feet and is now in the ball of my feet and my toes. There is a type of physical therapy called Anodyne. I cannot afford the copays for my insurance. I have heard good things. Best of luck to you. http://www.anodynetherapy.com/",
