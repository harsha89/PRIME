    "Content": "My score was 9 - my oncologist said at that score he didn't recommend chemo...and nobody said a word about radiation. I had a pretty big tumor, estrogen positive, but thankfully no lymph node involvement. I ended up opting to have the other breast removed proactively when I started reconstruction. Just doing 5 years of Femara, and that by itself was enough to knock me for a loop for about 6 months, when I'd been on estrogen for a long time. But for me, it could have been SO much worse, at least to this point.",
