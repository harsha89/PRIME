    "Content": "Little different from you as I was on the side where lymph nodes removed but after about 2 weeks past the time when the drains should have been pulled and still held steady at about 30cc the ONC finally figured out that my body was tring to fight off the drain. So we pulled the drain. He was also afraid of running the risk of infection leaving it in too much longer. Now the down side. Lymphedema. Under arm, in back and breast. Not severe but annoying. Drains out April 6 still lumpy and bumpy. I suppose you get you choice of which evil you want. Good luck!",
