    "Content": "I am 46 and recently was diagnosed with Stage I, IDC. I had dense tissue and many calcifications in both breasts. My maternal grandmother had breast cancer at 43. I had two biopsies; one cancerous and one calcifications. I do not have genetic mutation/BRCA. I opted for bilateral mastectomy, which I had in early February. My sentinal lymph nodes were clear and my margins were clear. I am doing great in recovery from surgery. I was told by my surgeon no chemo or radiation, but that since I opted for dbl mast, I might as well do Tamoxifen if tolerable. (I am premenopausal.) Since then, my oncologist had two tests done: Adjuvant! Online and Oncotype Dx. I had decided to give Tamoxifen a try, based on the surgeon's rec and the Adjuvant results. My Oncotype Dx came back slightly higher than I expected based on the Adjuvant. The Oncotype Dx at 19 put me in the low end of \"Intermediate\" risk, which means I have to decide whether or not to do chemo (CMF). (I am not low risk or high risk of recurrence. I am in between.) My oncologist recommends Tamoxifen, but says I am in the \"gray area\" for chemo and that it is up to me. I think I am leaning toward doing it, just to know I did what I could to eliminate any stray breast cancer cells. My relapse rate (from Adjuvant) would be 17.9% at 10 years, 11.2% with Tamoxofen, 7.3% with Tamoxofen and chemo. The chemo is CMF, in 6 4-week cycles. I am otherwise healthy and active. I have children, 18, 16 & 13. My husband had chemo, rad & 2 surgeries for head and neck cancer last year. He has NED and will have a scan next month. I am praying for clarity and peace in my decision! Anything you can offer is appreciated! Christ's peace to all you strong women and men! Julie",
