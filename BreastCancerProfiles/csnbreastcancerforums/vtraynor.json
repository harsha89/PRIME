    "Content": "My wife is desperately seeking info from someone who has been through a \"chemo-surgery-chemo\" treatment plan. She specifically wants reassurance that her hair will come back after getting zapped twice in such rapid succesion. I posted in another thread and but the responses were from ladies who lost their hair more than once but at longer intervals. Is anyone who has been through this willing to talk with her? Dennis",
