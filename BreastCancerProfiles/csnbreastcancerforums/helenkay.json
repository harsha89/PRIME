    "Content": "Yes, I took xeloda for 5-6 months in 2009. I had hand/foot syndrome and my fingernails all loosened up. I put Hello Kitty band-aids on until they grew stronger. My hands and feet were incredibly red and itchy. I used foot creams and soaked often. There's a foot cream that diabetics use. Get it at Wal-greens. The treatment must've worked. Cancer-free for 2 years now! Good luck to you!",
