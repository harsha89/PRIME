    "Content": "hi my mother was diagnoised in august, had a masectomy in september, and we just got her pathology report. they are recomending chemo even though they say her lympnoid is negative and they got all the cancer.   all of this has been super hard on her but i just want my mom back. she has no clue that i feel this way and im doing all that she needs. but inturnally it is really hard to see her vulnerable and depressed. is this temporary or is she going to forever struggle with a poor self image. my mother is the most beautiful person alive the way i see it but what matters right now is how she sees herself. she doesnt want to leave the house and when she has to go to drs apts she wears layers to hide the 'flater' side.   im sure i am just expecting too much of her but i want to hear from others about whether this is temporary or not?",
