    "Content": "Well I went for cycle 2 of my cytoxan and taxotere on 6-17. Within just a minute or two, I felt funny.. I guess I started to turn \"purple\". I was given o2 and i.v. benadryl and the treatment was stopped for a bit. When they started again I was able to get up to 100 drips per minute,but I started to have back and chest pain. At this point ,my Dr. said no more. Unfortunately this cycle didn't count,as I only got about a third of the taxotere. I am set to get adriamycin and cytoxan on 7-7. My M.D. sent me for a MUGA test and I will get the results tomorrow. Has anyone had this happen? Has anyone had this drug combo? P.S. I did have my head shaved yesterday.. Feels Very Weird!!!!",
