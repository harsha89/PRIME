Thank you all for your prayers, words and thoughts of encouragement, and for all the positive energy! I felt surrounded by so much love and support. Thank you so much.

I have to get up tomorrow morning at 5am (PST) and must be at the hospital at 6am. My mastectomy surgery should begin around 7:30am and will take approximately 1.5 to 2 hours long. I will be kept in hospital for one night and discharged sometime Thursday. My girls are with their Uma and Grandpa tonight and will stay with them for until possibly Friday. I appreciate all of your prayers, positive thoughts and energies. I will post an update when I get home from the hospital.",

I've come through so much and I'm beginning to feel lost and confused. I'm weepy a lot these days, mind you, there are many other things going on in our lives that are stressful and emotionally draining. Some days I feel like I'm going crazy. I'm not sleeping well, I'm having nightmares, anxiety attacks, and migraine headaches. Can anyone else relate to feeling this way? What can I do?",
