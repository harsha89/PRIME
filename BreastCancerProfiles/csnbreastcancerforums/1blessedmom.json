    "Content": "I don't blame you for your hesitation in taking this medication. Especially if you're already experiencing joint pain already. I took Arimidex for about 2 months and had to stop because I was experienceing such extreme pain. I couldn't even pick up something if I dropped it on the floor. The joint pain was excrutiating. My son said I would moan in my sleep from the pain. I started getting horrible pain in my wrist and was having a hard time picking up or even using my left hand due to the sharp pain. I made an appointment with my oncologist and told her I had to stop taking the medication. She changed me to Tomaxifin and I've been fine. I also had osteoporosis in my past and I'll be going for a bone scan in the next week. Curious to see if I'll have any effects from all the treatment. Not everyone has the bad side effects. I suggest you give it a try and if you start feeling your pain progress get ahold of your oncologist right away and change meds. I'll be praying the best for you.  ",
