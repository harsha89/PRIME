      "Content": "Be totally honest with your travel companions and you should be fine. Plan in advance the things you really want to do and pace yourself. Don't be afraid to take breaks or even rent a scooter if you want to. Vegas is like Disneyland for grown-ups and many handicapped and elderly people visit there often. I'm sure your family will be glad to work around your energy level and will probably need breaks now and then too! Go for it!",

Dry eyes, bifocals and light sensitivity are pretty common, but definitely get your eyes checked and tell the eye doctor (not optomitrist!) all the medication you are on.",

      "Content": "Dear Wendy, it sounds like you've had some good news! The only thing I can add is that I had the blue stuff injected around my lymph nodes. It showed negative, but the surgeon took the sentinel node out anyway. It was clean, but having had a node removed, you have to be careful of that side. They shouldn't use it for drawing blood or taking blood pressure. Also, the blue booby phenomon lasted me for months! The dye settled into the underside of my breast and it looked bruised, but felt fine. Just a heads up for what may happen. Glad they caught it early! Good luck.",

      "Content": "Went over the results of my latest bone scan with the oncologist. The good news is the areas that were radiated look great. The bad news is they found a lot of new mets in my ribs. Bad news - the onc thinks the femara has stopped working. Good news - he's switching me to faslodex beginning next treatment and I won't have to take a pill everyday. Bad news - I had a couple of crying jags alone in my car - my favorite place to cry! Good news - my normally realistic husband has found his optimistic side. He says it is good that the doc is putting me on more aggressive treatment. This will be the third drug we have tried since completing chemo. Bad news - if it doesn't work, it will be more chemo for me. Good news - I am actually quite striking bald! Well, my pity party is over. Thank you all for coming.",

      "Content": "Normally, a woman going thru menopause would be encouraged to eat foods containing natural estrogens to help replace her own hormones, but since my original tumor had estrogen receptors, even plant estrogen would help my cancer grow. I am taking femara to keep my body from making estrogen and trying to eat more estrogen inhibiting foods, like berries, citrus fruit, squash and broccoli. The white flour and white rice are really the only refined foods that inhibit estrogen production. What I really miss is cooking with olive oil and garlic! Check www.holisticonline.com for info on alternative medicine and nutrition. I fall off the wagon daily, but am doing my best.",

      "Content": "Wildangel, we can only do the best we can. Yes, most bottled waters start out as tap water, but they are processed to remove minerals and contamination. I personally have a pitcher filter that I use to refill washed water bottles so I have a little control over what I drink. Because I am er+, I have to avoid plant and animal estrogens, including all animal flesh, dairy products and soy beans. Guess what most vegetarian and low fat products are made from? Soybeans! Given the choice between two things that are bad for me, I'll take the one that tastes better! I also have to avoid foods I love like tomatoes, carrots, whole wheat, brown rice, sweet potatoes and oats. I use to be high fiber girl and now have to eat white flour and white rice because they inhibit estrogen. I have never smoked, gave up alcohol 15 years ago and am the thinnest member of my birth family and yes, THE ONLY ONE WHO GOT CANCER! It's not fair, but it's the hand we were dealt.",
