      "Content": "I had a right side modified radical masectomy (although at this time no reconstruction) - nothing hurt! I can actually say that I had no pain except for under my arm (I got 24 lymph nodes removed, 11 were positive) I ordered supper the night of my masectomy from the hospital cafeteria, felt tine, and got out of the hospital the very next day at 1:00pm (after ordering breakfast) I had my surgery on Sept. 24, 2009 and still have had no pain in the breast area. I have been doing exercises to work my underarm after the lymph nodes were removed. That was the biggest thing is that I could not use my right arm very good at all therefore stayed home from work for a few weeks. But no pain and no exhaustion for me. Good luck to you and if it is any consolation, I really WISH now that I would have gotten a bilateral - easier to get 2 prosthesis, rather than to match just one! Keep writing, everyone in this great group of gals is here for you!",
