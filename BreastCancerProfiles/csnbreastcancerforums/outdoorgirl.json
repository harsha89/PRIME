Don't know if I'm just being paranoid or not( my husband thinks it's just her quiet personality),but it seems like sometimes the neighbor woman across the street tries really hard to ignore me(seems like it started when I was diagnosed and especially when I lost my hair). Her husband on the other hand always smiles when he sees me and will ask how I am.(Maybe that's just his personality) Pat and Tash,I am sorry about the neglect from your family members.I'm not too good at visiting, myself,(as we live a distance from any of our families) but if a family member was battling a disease like this-you can bet I'd want to be there!

Hopefully soon though you will be able to see that there really is life after cancer,but it's a new life! I always prided myself on being a healthy person-short of having thyroid disease-until the c-bomb dropped. Some of my friends and family think that I'm morbid because when they ask how I am,I tell them that I'm with NED-but I'm not necessarily \"out of the woods\". I think the only people who feel the way I and others feel are the people who have been there. I'm hoping that after a while you will see that you can still enjoy life and hopefully not think about cancer as much. I think my best times are when I don't even think about it because I'm busy living and enjoying life! I think it is possible to do that and not be in denial. And yes,it's okay to rant-especially here where we all \"get it\" anyways!! Hoping that life gets better for you, Patty",

I know for me,I will still take it anyways.I'm going to ask my onc questions about the different medications when it comes time to make my choice.There aren't any guarantees that I won't get reccurance or a new cancer,but I'm going to try to do everything I can to keep it at bay.

I think in some ways cancer and the treatments have changed me in negative ways and in some positive ways. Positively,I am more outspoken and climbed out of my shell more to do things I wouldn't have done before-I am finding some self esteem and using it in my volunteering for ACS and helping teach Sunday School to 11th and 12th graders(I was kind of intimidated by teenagers before,but I'm finding out now that I really enjoy them-maybe that is too because my husband and I don't have kids and don't have to be with them 24/7,I don't know!!). A lot of people have said that we're living a new normal after being a survivor,maybe this is part of it? You are a tough cookie! It's like what I told a fellow bc friend before-you can't have gone through cancer and be a weeny or just someone to be pitied! You're like my onc calls me sometimes-strong and brave!
