      "Content": "I was wondering if anyone else sees this disease as a big money maker for dr.s radiologists drug companys hospitals etc. I just feel like the organization is just putting me on a conveyer belt and moving me down the line ,like a factory, do this, zap that, see me in 2 weeks. Its not that I dislike any one of the Dr.s that I have, maybe because Iv been a nurse in ICU so long and see how the system takes people in, drains the insurence, and dosent really look at the person.Its a definit negative vib. if I express an opinion or rock the traditional cancer boat. well thats my rant, and hope I didnt offend anyone,,best best best to all Kathy,",
