I opted for both for symmetry and because I had a cancer that was likely to recurr, and had already had a lumpectomy in the other one. Also, I am est/prgten neg. I would have done the diep if it had been available in my area to save my ab muscles, but, I do not regret have reconstruction. Do be sure that you like and trust your plastic surg. good luck making your decision. Jan",

Well, I hesitate to say anything cause this is your life, but, if you have never seen Vegas and you want to do it, talk to your docs and see if it is in your best interest. You can take naps and for a lot of the trip, there is no reason to leave the hotel if a casino is there, and most do have one. It is a 24 hour town, and a lot of fun, but, quite exhausting. Talk to your family too and get their feed back. I cannot imagine that they would want to put you at risk or expect you to go if you are just not up to it. They love you and will support whatever you decide. Hang in there honey. I hope that you get to go. Love...Jan",

I think that your younger son sounds like he is distancing himself from you, and this could be normal or made a bit worse because of the breast cancer. They do that, most kids, around 17. I would try to do something with them that makes you happy and that you can all enjoy. Don't give up, the older son too will mature into his life and I hope get better. You are not a horrible mom. Raising teens is hard enough without breast cancer. I agree that a support group would be a good idea. Please stop kicking yourself and look forward honey. Please....",

      "Content": "Hi..I had a tram flap reconstruction and I still have some issues with lumps and hard places that are painful. My surgeon has me in at least monthly so that he can monitor them, not because he thinks they are malignant but, in case he will need to remove any more tissue. I had surgery 8 mos ago. I get confused as to how my cancer would return since I was told it would return in the scar line most likely. That area is so lumpy and weird anyway. Has anyone had a recurrance that has had a mastectomy in the area of breast removal, with or without reconstruction? What was it like? Thanks so much Jan",

I will most certainly buy them. My cancer was est/prog negative. And, again, I thank any company who is trying to help find a cure.",

      "Content": "What brought me here originally was seeking ppl of like kind, who would understand the fears and demons. What kept me here was the interaction and relationships that were built in that process. I have seen ppl posting here end up going down, their posts stop making sense and then we lose them. That is hard. But they needed us to the end. I am an artist as well, and I also write with the unending help of spell check, grammar check and reading what I write 15 times. I think the common link initially is our illness and then what keeps ppl here are the relationships and that is when like kind ppl come out. I think the ones who don't fit in, stay a minute and leave and the others stay and they share so much wisdom that they have learned. They have a purpose. Is Inkblot still here? I found myself buying pins, bracelets and other bc items in bulk and sending small objects to the newly diagnosed. It made me feel good to touch someone in a positive way I had never seen. So, I was meeting my caregiver need without rescuing someone. I left here for a while also to take a break from cancer. MS became king. When that diagnosis was given, I was in the battle of my life with a horrible boss. So a lot of stuff was out of kilter. It was a blessing to go out on disability from him, but not to fall down and not remember the names of things or my childhood, etc. With medication I am better. Then this. So, they're off...neck to neck, taking the first turn...who will take precendence...bc or ms. I will know after my surgeon sees my film or does the biopsy. But, this is a wonderful place. I love all my sisters and occasional brothers that come here. Jan",

      "Content": "Hi...I had my mammo at a imaging facility, was told to wait 6 mos. I called my MD who referred me to the surgeon so that he could review my films and see if he recommended a core needle biopsy. Upon review, he concurred with the imaging center, that I did not have cancer. But, because he could see how nervous I was, and because of my family history, he sent me for the core needle, which was done by the imaging center. The core needle is done with the assistance of film...so, I think that they are done by imaging ppl. And of course, they were both wrong. The imaging center that I went to is a breast clinic, that is all that they do. You just need a referral to get the biopsy. Any of your doctors can refer you, your regular doc, your GYN,etc. So, I would go to whichever doctor you are comfortable with and get the biopsy done, that is your main concern. Once you get the results, if they are not good, then you can worry about the surgeon. Your doctor will be able to get you in very quickly should it not be benign.... Good luck and please do this next week. And, keep us posted. Jan",

That seems to be how it goes, you apply to a million places and they all come in at once. I go tomorrow to interview for a consumer affairs job and I am excited. So far, a loan officer, a case worker, a benefits consultant and the one tomorrow. Keep your fingers crossed that one of them offers me a job. (I owned a small investment company that I had to close when I was dx, so, this is a big step for me and a relief. A job now will not come a second too soon. But, I guess that things work out for the best. I do not think that I was ready to work until now..today was my 6 month anniversary from my bilateral mastectomy!!) Jan",
