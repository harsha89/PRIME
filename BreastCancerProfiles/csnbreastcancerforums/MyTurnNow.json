I was never a hat person either but I wear either a headwrap (purchased at www.4women.com) or a ball cap or bucket hat. The hats have a totally different look without hair. Good luck and I hope you find something to your satisfaction.",

I immediately went on line to obtain as much information as I could. I had experienced cancer in my life but not breast cancer and therefore I needed knowledge. Shame on that nurse for scolding you.

I controlled the pain with Tylenol every 6 hours. I did lose my hair around day 14 from the first transfusion. That, to me, was the hardest part of the chemo. I continued to exercise a minimum of 3 days and usually 5 days per week. I do Jazzercise which is an aerobic workout that includes strength training. My oncologist said I probably did so well because I did exercise. Who knows. We are all different but we are all getting through this and slaying the beast.

Well, as my subject line says, I am AGAIN going to go head to head with the beast. This is the third time in 3 years. This time, I am going to Mayo Clinic to get a second opinion. Who am I kidding, I'm thinking very strongly of switching my care to them. I have an appointment with them next Tuesday. I have been busy getting all my records, scans, path reports, etc. sent to them. They have a large breast cancer research center here in Jacksonville. I received the results from the needle core biopsy last Friday. I have to admit I was surprised but not shocked. I found a lump on the scar line several months ago. I am pissed off at my plastic surgeon because I brought this to his attention and inquired if it was perhaps scar tissue (you know how we like to think of anything other than the big \"C\"). He kind of brushed it off and agreed with me. He was never my favorite of doctors because I always felt his bedside manner skills were lacking. He is more interested in the plastic part of his job and not so much into the actual person. I am pissed at myself too because I have found my last two lumps and should have been more proactive. But, after all, he is the medical doctor, not me! I am certain the outcome would have been the same, I would again be diagnosed with IDC but perhaps the treatment may not have been so invasive. I met with my previous surgeon on Monday of this week and if she were going to treat me, it would involve removing the implant, surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. She said the radiation would destroy the latissimus muscle that was moved forward after my bilateral mastectomy and so IF I was going to consider reconstruction again, my choice would be either the LAT Flap or Diep Flap. Both surgeries are very extensive and approximately 10 hours long. I won't know until I go to Mayo what they recommend but I am definately not going through that type of surgery again. So, I will keep you updated as I learn my new path down this road again. I know that I can and will get through this again and what makes that a little easier is ALL of YOU!!

      "Content": "Sue, I did my first (and only) walk last year. I was in the beginning of rads at the time. It was a very emotional situation and especially the survivors photo. I was so astounded that there were so many survivors. That really is a very good thing!! Our walk was on the beach and there was no survivors walk just the photo. I was proud to be a part of the photo and to also raise money to help towards finding a cure. If you can't walk, I'm sure that hubby of yours will carry you around the track in his arms. He truly is a wonderful man and I'm sure he'll provide the support you need. You are a survivor. You went through treatments to get to this point and you deserve the recognition. Stand tall and walk with you head held high!! We'll all be with you in spirit.",

I also had chemo and rads. Just as I was scheduled for my first mammo post treatment, I noticed another lump in the same affected breast, just in another location. I had a recurrence in July 2010 and at the second dx opted for the bilateral mastectomy with 2 levels of lumph nodes removed. Thank goodness, they were clear. So, you did what you thought was right for you. I hope you never have to hear those words again but you need to stay vigilent with your self exams.

My rads onc recommended aloe as the only cream to use. I used it daily right after my rads and again before bed. I had 29 regular treatments and 9 boosters. I turned a little pink with the boosters but really did not burn. It has been almost a year ago and I still have my rads tan.

Mine recommended only 100% aloe. I get my radiaiation at 10:20 every morning so I don't use any type of lotion after my morning shower. Once my radiation is over, I do put on some aloe lotion when changing back into my clothes. I also put some on at night. I've only had 7 treatments so I haven't noticed anything yet. Good luck to you and keep us updated on your treatment and how it's going.",

      "Content": "I haven't updated because I really don't have the treatment plan, yet. It has been a fun-filled couple of weeks worth of ups and downs. When I had a CT scan, it revealed a 1cm mass on my liver. Well, needless to day, I was surprised to hear those results. Then, I was scheduled for a liver biopsy. The preliminary as well as the final pathology concluded that it was a benign mass, I believe it was called an adenoma. I heard the work \"benign\" loud and clear and was elated. So, to be certain, I am now scheduled for a PET scan next Wednesday. The results of the PET will determine the route of my treatment. IF, and I'm being very optimistic here, it is clear, except for the breast, I will have surgery and then chemo. The chemo they are taking about is 4 rounds of AC and then 4 rounds of Taxol. There is the possibility that I may have radiation again, too. IF cancer shows up anywhere else, I will have chemo first and then surgery. So, like I said, I'm still in the testing stages. I must say that I am very impressed with the care at Mayo. I like the idea of MY team of doctors all meeting to discuss my personal situation. It is so different than my last 2 rounds with breast cancer. I keep hoping that the third time is a charm. I told one of my oncologists yesterday that I was amazed at how good I feel. I will continue to keep my positive outlook both on the inside and outside. I have a wonderful support group in not only my family and friends but ALL of YOU, too! I meet again next Friday with my oncologist and will be more knowledgable about my treatment plan. I told the oncologist on Friday that we need to get the show on the road because I have signed up for the 26.2 with Donna to be held in February. This is a marathon that will celebrate its 5th year next year. It was the vision of one of our local news anchor who is also a breast cancer survivor. 70% of the money collected for this event is presented to the Mayo Clinic for research. This has turned out to be a very substantial amount. The motto for Donna's race is to \"Finish Breast Cancer\". I only hope to be alive the day the announcement is made that a cure has been found!! I will keep you posted as I continue on this journey. I love you all and thanks for checking on me. Also, thank you for the emails and cards. This is a wonderful community and I am so happy I found you all 2 years ago!!",

It really doesn't matter one way or the other but I wondered if perhaps this was the first time to lose your hair. The words that mean the most to me from your post are \"I want to try and live a normal life...\". I read into that that you want to live. There are several ladies that are stage IV and perhaps they can provide some knowledge as to the journey based on this stage. There are some really nice wigs, scarfs, etc. that may help in your self image. I personally wore scarfs and ball caps. Bottom line, I wish you strength to accept what you will have to do to live your life as normal as possible. Sending (((hugs))) your way!! Stay strong sister.",

Well, it was invasive ductal carcinoma and I then began the appointments and ultimate decisions regarding treatments. I had a lumpetomy, chemo and radiation. I just finished my treatments on Christmas Eve and have now started the 5-year pill Arimidex (my cancer was estrogen positive). It's all very overwhelming initially so I would suggest that you stop and take a breath and then take it one day at a time.

So, I came to the realization very early on that I would do whatever I needed to do. You have an advantage over me and that is that you found this site in the very early stage. I didn't find these wonderful people until August and at that point I had already decided on the surgery and was in the middle of chemo. I had a hard time making the decision on lumpectomy versus mastectomy. My point is there are women and men on this board that have experienced any type of surgery and various regimes of chemo. We'll be here to provide our experiences and help in any way we can to help you make informed decisions. I'll continue to hope that you DO NOT have cancer and therefore can continue with your new life of RVing. The worst that can happen is you have to postpone your start date for a couple of months!!
