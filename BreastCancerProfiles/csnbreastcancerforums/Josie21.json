Speaking to a counselor and going on lexapro for a year saved my sanity. Of course it's ok to cry, just make sure you are not getting over come with depression. I couldn't believe how fast it happened. The best thing the counselor said to me was ,\"You did not have a tooth pulled. You were told you had a disease that was going to change your life forever. It's normal to feel sad.\"  ",
