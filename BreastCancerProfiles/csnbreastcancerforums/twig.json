    "Content": "Karen, I had 4 cycles of Taxotere also. I had the same side effects in my nails. My nails did not fall off, but they did separate from the nail bed. I would not use glue - that sounds like you could have some bad results. I used tea tree oil and it seemed to help - the nails did not come off, but the soreness and weirdness will remain. You can buy tea tree oil at health food stores and Whole Foods. Additionally, Sally Hansen puts out a cream with tea tree oil in it. My nails are finally growing out, and they have no permanent damage.",
