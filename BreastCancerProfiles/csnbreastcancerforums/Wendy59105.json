    "Content": "OK My cancer is in the smallest possible stage it could even be detected....I am between 0 and 1....NOT 1 and 2. This is good. The bad thing is, it is of the invasive nature and there is a possibility it seeped into one of the ducts in my breast and off to the lymph nodes. I tried to pin him down to a percentage of this chance and got maybe 10 -15% chance of this happening. My receptors were negative, and I am told this is unfavorable, don't really understand why this bad yet, back to the research. I am slated for surgery this friday to have a sentinel node biopsy, where they will find this out. I am not buying on odds though.....this was 85% chance just to be calcium! Yet I think whatever the outcome, I will end up ok. Thank God for mammograms, this could have gotten horrible. So for now, I pray for clean nodes.......that is my focus. I go in at 8 and have some radioactive blue stuff put in my breast...wait for a couple hours and then roll into surgery around 12 I think. I am told I will have a blue boob for awhile after, maybe even a month! hahahaha I will take a pic! I will supposedly pee blue for awhile as well. It sounded like he has done these node things for at least 7 years,,,,so this is good. Anyway, that's it for now. I am somewhat relieved, but still have my doubts.....which is normal. Can anyone tell me how important the receptor thing is? Oh yeah...the margins around this area were clean...that's gotta count for something?",
