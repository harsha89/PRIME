      "Content": "I had a mastectomy(r only) Nov 2. I didn't have any more nodes removed. There was very little pain. I have been up and moving all week. I have noticed I get tired if I'm too active. The drain was removed Tuesday. As far as returning to work I would let my body determine that. Remember you just had major surgery that will affect you both physically and emotionally. Give yourself some time to adjust and recover. I pray all goes well on Thursday.",

      "Content": "Congrats on finishing chemo!!! I didn't have chemo but I have been on tomoxifen since Nov 2007. The most annoying se I have had are hor flashes. Like Claudia said it is an estrogen blocker. It stops cancer cells from feeding off estrogen. According to my onc it reduces the chances of a recurrance by about 50%. If you only had surgery on one breast, it also reduces the chance of getting it in the other breast. My experience is the se are manageable but everybody reacts differently. After chemo it should be no problem.",
