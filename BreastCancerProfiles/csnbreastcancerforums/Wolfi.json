      "Content": "I propose that each of us post a nice quote or joke in this discussion so that Eileen will have some distraction waiting for Friday. Laughter IS one of the best medicines. My son is in the Army and just graduated basic training. This isn't really a quote or a joke but I thought it was worth sharing: ******************** An American Soldier was taking some college courses between assignments. He had completed 20 missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. One of the courses had a professor who was an avowed atheist, and a member of the ACLU. One day the professor shocked the class when he came in. He looked to the ceiling and flatly stated, \"GOD, if you are real, then I want you to knock me off this platform....I'll give you exactly 15 minutes.\" The lecture room fell silent. You could hear a pin drop. Ten minutes went by and the professor proclaimed, \"Here I am GOD, I'm still waiting.\" It got down to the last couple of minutes when the Soldier got off his chair, went up to the professor, and cold-cocked him; knocking him off the platform. The professor was out cold. The Soldier returned to his seat and sat there, silently. The other students were shocked and stunned, and sat there looking in silence. The professor eventually came to, noticable shaken, looked at the Soldier and asked, \"What in the world is the matter with you? Why did you do that?\" The Soldier calmly replied, \"GOD was too busy today protecting American's soldiers who are protecting your right to say stupid stuff and act like an idiot. So He sent me. The classroom erupted in cheers.",

Getting a lot of information is important when dealing with bc treatments in order to make informed decisions and be happy with them. I also opted to not do any reconstruction due to the extra surgeries that would be needed.",

      "Content": "I agree with TJ - let your friends and family help you and let them deal with the Thanksgiving activities. You may feel just fine by then, but you may not. The thing I've found with having bc is that it is a \"one day at a time\" kind of life for a while. I would feel fine one day and lousy the next. Surgery, chemo, radiation, medication and stress over the whole life changing experience can throw you for a loop. I would suggest accepting as many offers of meals as you can get - this helps a lot. As far as the drama of the people that love you: don't spend too much time dealing with friends and family members who seem to take away your energy. You'll need all of your energy for yourself and can't afford to spend much on other people for a while. There are some friends and co-workers of mine that don't even know I have bc even though I was diagnosed in June and had my bilateral in August. I chose to not tell them because I knew that they would be too much of an emotional and mental pain than I needed at this time. Some people seem to mean well, but do things (like fund raising or taking up a collection) in your name just so THEY can be the center of attention. My advice to handling some of the drama is having a person who is your \"middle man\" when dealing with exhausting people. My husband does this for me - he deals with the phone calls, the visits, problems with the kids, etc. It is nice to have to tell only one person when I don't feel well enough for company and everything gets taken care of. Good luck next Thursday! Post when you can.",

If you have lymph nodes removed you may have lymphodema which could start or get worse due to the cabin pressure when flying. I would suggest clearning ALL travel so soon after surgery with your doctor just to be on the safe side. I would hate for you to be in another state if you ended up with an infection from surgery or swelling (lymphodema) from flying. It would be difficult for me to have to go to a new doctor in an emergency like that. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Teena, Although I've never worked at a food pantry, I have always been into donating food to the local pantry. I had a lot of fun when my kids were small and I was trying to teach them about money. Whenever they got spending money (from allowance, birthdays, Christmas, etc) I made them put some in savings, keep some for spending, and have some for donating. We would go to the store and buy as many cans of food as we could with their money and then drop it off at the food pantry on the way home. That way they could see the \"big picture\" of how it all worked to help others. They still talk about that so it is something that must have stuck with them. One thing I would like to point out to everyone is that sometimes food pantries need cash in order to purchase things that are in high demand (like can openers, diapers, toothpaste, etc). There was a food pantry at our old church and although they received enough canned and boxed food donations they were always short on toiletries and baby products. We would donate food but I would also regularly give cash donations so the person running the food pantry could purchase anything else that ran out during the month. Helping others is one of the best feelings around.",

I'm not saying Bag Balm should be used for radiation, BUT it IS good if you have really dry hands or feet in the winter. I buy mine at Walgreens in the lotion isle. It is in a square, green tin. It doesn't smell the greatest, but it really does a good job softening dry skin. I put it on my feet before bed and then put big cotton socks on to sleep in. By the morning my feet aren't dry - just be careful in the shower - slippery. This can also be put on your hands before bed and then put socks on your hands to sleep in (usually requires help from someone else).",

      "Content": "Ruthielaine, I had a biopsy and then lumpectomy without clear margins. I was scheduled for a mastectomy but opted for a bilateral after I thought about it for a while. Although it was a difficult decision (and one I wish I hadn't had to make at all) I am very pleased with my results and don't regret it one bit. In my situation I felt \"safer\" (if that is possible) by having both breasts removed at the same time even though I didn't have any signs of cancer in the left breast. I found out after the pathology report came back that my left breast had calcifications in it that didn't show up on any tests. Calcifications in my right breast are what prompted the biopsy with the resulting DCIS in the first place. You need to do what will make YOU feel safe. Don't worry about what anyone else tells you for their opinion (doctors, husband, friends, co-workers, us on this site), YOU are the one who will have to live with whatever you decide. If you are comfortable with having a bilateral then go forward with no regrets. You are not alone. There are MANY people that have gone through (or will go through) what you are right now. Best of luck on your surgery. Please post if you have any other questions or concerns. This is a wonderful site and has been a lifesaver for me during this difficult time.",

That helped, but I still wake up almost every night before I've had more than six hours of sleep (although it is better than the 3-4 hours I was getting). Don't be too hard on yourself and give in to your tears when you are able. Some days I cry on the way to work and on the way home but \"shut off\" my emotions while I'm at work or with my family.

There is something about taking thoughts and feelings and putting them down in black ink (or on a screen) that pulls the worries from inside me. Do whatever you need to do in order to feel better. I know what you mean about well-meaning friends looking at you with sympathetic eyes. I am going in for my surgery on 8/26 and I have only told five people at work that I even have a problem. Partially because this is a very personal type of cancer and partially because I don't want to have to field all of the (nosey) questions from co-workers who will ask things that are none of their business. I'm tired of all the tests, too. Just the other day we were on our way to see a genetics counselor and my oncologist when I broke down in the car and told my husband I just wanted to go home. Of course I really didn't want to go home, I was just tired of all the \"stuff\" I've been through lately. Go ahead and be scared and tired for a while. Then think of all the positive things you have - friends and your good health. I hope my post has helped you a little. Everyone dealing with breast cancer has, is or will go through some of your feelings at one time or another. There is nothing wrong with how you are feeling and you ARE a poster child for senior vitality. I hope I have that few things wrong with me when I'm your age (in 26 years). Take care.",

The surgery damages a lot of nerves and it takes a while for them to figure out what they're doing and get set up again. I have not experienced the shooting pain you mentioned although I am currently dealing with tightness in my chest muscles. What I did to prepare (mentally) for my surgery was to think about WHY I was having this done - to get rid of the cancer that could take my life away. Then I wrapped an ace bandage tight around my chest and looked at myself in the mirror for a while so I could try to get used to seeing myself flat chested (I was a 38DD). Finally I told myself that I would look great, feel better eventually, and not have to ever wear a bra again. The mental image of being able to go for a jog without having to wear a sports bra or having my breasts hurt when I was done is the thing that got me to a point of acceptance. My surgery went well and I am still happy with my decisions. You are right, you will never be the same again. When you are done you will be new, improved and healthy. Good luck with your surgery and take care of yourself! Wolfi",

I've read other posts on skin issues but nothing that is exactly like what I'm going through so I'm looking for some help. I woke up this morning at 3:00am with pain. I now have three blisters on my back (by my shoulder)and it looks like one of them broke open. Under my arm the skin is starting to peel off and is VERY uncomfortable. I can take Tylenol for the pain but I guess I'm more worried about getting an infection because of the open skin areas. I don't want to put cream on the parts that have broken skin but I don't think there is anything else I can do. Another question I have is about my lymphodema - will this make it worse? I've been very careful with my arm up to this point and I have a mild case of lymphodema and don't want it to get worse. I'm thinking about calling a 24 hour nurse line because I'm not sure that my radiation clinic has an after hours call in number. Is this something I should just try to deal with until tomorrow morning?",
