    "Content": "Dear Pam; Thanks for keeping us up to date. I have tagged you as one of my \"friends\" in this discussion group as I am also a survivor of stage IV breast cancer. You sound strong and hopeful and that is a major part of getting to recovery. I hope you will let me add my prayers for you and your family. My husband had knee surgery one week last January and I had a femur fracture re-set the next week. My 85 year old Dad was helping us both in and out of the car for a couple of weeks! But we made it. I have since had that femur and my hip totally replaced with prosthesis and have shed wheelchair, walker, and almost shed the cane. Last weekend my husband, Marcos and I flew in a hot air balloon at the Alberqueque Balloon Festival. I have decided to do all those things I put off in my life. I am going to do each of them as I can. No more putting them off. Wellness and happiness I wish to send you...on the wings of the angels. Take care, Mary",
