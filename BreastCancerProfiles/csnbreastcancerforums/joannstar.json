      "Content": "It is a very personal decision...I was newly married (first time for me and I'm 57) just 4 months before diagnosis. I wanted to be healthy as soon as possible. I had 2 lumpectomies--the second one to get clean margins--8/10. I started 6 rounds of chemo (Taxotere/Cytoxan for the first 4 and Taxol/Cytoxan for the last 2 because my ankles swelled) which I completed on 1/7/11. I went for the radiation \"mapping\" yesterday and plan to start my 6.5 weeks of radiation on 2/7/11. My diagnosis was Stage 1C (1.5 cm), medium grade, 0/4 nodes, TNB. The breast that had cancer was the larger of the two so after the lumpectomies, I'm just about even now. I was told by my surgeon (and my onc confirmed in my case)that the survival rate was no better with mastectomy than lumpectomy with radiation (and because I'm TN, I had chemo too). I'm guessing that the healing process is easier (compared to my cousin-in-law's experience who had a double mastectomy and then reconstruction) and I worked the entire time except for 1.5 weeks after the first surgery, 1 week after the second and 2 days each cycle of chemo. I would talk with your surgeon and oncologist about your choices and if necessary seek a second opinion. I have friends that opted for a mastectomy so that they didn't need chemo or radiation, but as a TN, those are the only treatments available, so you may need to have them anyway. I know that many warrior sisters will be able to tell you about their experiences. Good luck. JoAnn",

      "Content": "When I was first diagnosed as DCIS, I was told just radiation. After the 2nd lumpectomy to get clean margins, the staging came back as Stage 1, Grade 3, TNBC, 0N. I was advised strongly to have chemo before radiation. My cancer was 1.6cm and no nodes, but because of TNBC, I did 6 rounds of T/C and then 33 rounds of rads. My husband of 4 months told me later, that he would have been upset had I refused the chemo (he'd lost his first wife 10 years early from a drug interaction of her meds). I put my trust in my onc and did what he said. Fast forward to 4.5 years later, I'm glad I went through all of the treatment. So far I am NED!! I was told that TNBC responds well to chemo and if it recurs, it is usually within the first 3 years. The question that I grappled with is: If I do not do chemo and have a recurrance, how will I deal with that fact that I didn't do all that was recommended? Good luck with your dicision...it is a hard one to make. Hugs, JoAnn  ",

To my surprise, I realized I had mostly salt and pepper hair coloring (been dying it for over 40 years, so I hadn't been \"au natural\" for a long time). All of the pepper fell out just leaving straggly white hairs. I never did shave my head...no need to. I wore my wig on Friday nights at temple, but other than that I just wore scarves or headwraps.

I was diagnosed 8/19/10 with Stage 1, Grade 3, TNBC. Some of the side effects in no particular order: minimal nauseau (kept in check with meds), starting losing my hair about day 14 of the first round of chemo--on the stubborn gray hairs seemed to not fall out, swelling ankles, itching rash, burning feet, ridged and discolored finger and toenails (but none fell out), metallic taste, no nose hair so my nose \"ran\" constantly for 5 months, watering eyes and both diarrhea and constipation. All-in-all, not fun, but doable and eventually, you'll be able to look back and say, \"Whew! I'm glad that's over\" and \"I did it\". Good luck, JoAnn",
