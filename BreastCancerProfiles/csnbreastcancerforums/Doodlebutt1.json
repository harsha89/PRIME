    "Content": "Hello, I'm a 35 year old cancer survivor!! :) Well, my cancer journey started January 26th 2015. I found a lump in my right breast and wanted to have it checked out. I had gone to a different doctor because I wanted to get in as soon as possible. The doctor told me he thought it was nothing to worry about but wanted to do a mammogram just to be safe. Well the mammogram found what the doctor thought was just calcium. I had a biopsy on February 12th and on February 18th I was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer. At first the doctors thought that is was small and easily treatable but after a PET scan they found that the cancer had taken over my left breast and spread into the lymphnodes of my chest wall. As terrified as I was I think I handled things pretty well, I didnt have too much anxiety or depression through my whole process. I went through 15 weeks of chemo then a double mastectomy follwed by a month and a half of radiation therapy. I am done with everything except for a maintenance herceptin. Like I said earlier I think I handled things pretty well the whole time but it's now after it's been two months since radiation I feel like I'm falling apart. I feel depressed at least once a day if not more. I can be feeling great singing to music and having a great day and then all of the sudden it feels like the rug was pulled out from under me. I start to bawl and usually it doesn't stop for about a half an hour. People keep telling me this is normal and that it will get better but it kind of scares me. I've gone through depression before when I lost my mom at my dad's hand but this just seems so different. I know that I would never hurt myself because I care about my family and friends way too much to do that but I still feel like I'm drowning and just can't breath. So I'm asking anyone here for help, just knowing that I'm not alone isn't quite enough to help me through this. I know that so many men and women have gone through this but I still feel so alone.Â ",
