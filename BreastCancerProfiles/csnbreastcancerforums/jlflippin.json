    "Content": "Tumor markers I had this test done before they found the lump in my left breast and they ignored it, and even though it was a 23 my doctor didn't feel it was anything to worry about. Now 4 months later when I have my mammogram they found a lump in my left breast that is 10mm x 8mm. I'm torn between anger, grief and fear. Do I go ahead and have a doulbe mastectomy? Seeing as I had cancer in my right breast in 2001 or just go with the lumpectomy and wait to see if it re-occurs in another 10 years. I had lumpectomy, chemo and 26 rounds of radiation in 2001.",
