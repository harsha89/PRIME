For those who have already done radiation, or are doing it now, do you think this happens very often? I know they are very expensive machines and they can't keep a spare one around...but I wanted to get an idea of how many days in a row this would probably happen or if it is unusual.",

      "Content": "Last Saturday, I had my regular teeth cleaning appointment. Have been done with chemo for 8 months. The dental hygenist came across 3 \"sensitive\" spots below the gum line. Have never had this problem before. Have had cleaning appointments every 6 months from childhood. She claimed these new sensitive spots were related to chemo, but didn't have any suggestions other than using Sensidine (sp?) toothpaste and trying to schedule cleaning appointments 3 times a year instead of 2 times a year for a while so that the gum stays as close as possible against the nerves and plaque doesn't get a foothold. Will be interested to hear if others run into this symptom.",
