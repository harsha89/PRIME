I'm sending you warm hugs. Mama G, I love the way you've connected your dear ones to signs from events that occur in your life--how lovely. My dad still \"talks\" to me in my head; though my mother doesn't still talk to me, I see her photographs every day. Both of them are still with me in my memories. For me, the memories of their love now have become bigger than the losses, though that certainly wasn't true at first. Sandy",

I've been feeling uncomfortable with my lack of exercise, too, and yesterday I attended my very first yoga class! I'm really excited about it--wow, am I ever inflexible compared to some of those people! Very out of condition. Yet I loved feeling that I could do most of the exercises at least to some degree without feeling completely overwhelmed, that progress does appear to be a real possibility if I stick with it, and that I didn't come away hurting so much that I would give up immediately. LOL! Certainly I have a long way to go to develop the strength and flexibility of some of the students, much less the teacher, and some of the more complicated positions may be forever beyond me, but I'm sure I can work toward the modifications and increase my strength and condition. What a good feeling! Plus I have the added bonus that when the weather permits, I can add aerobic conditioning by walking to & from class. I know how very important exercise is to my mental condition, so I'm very glad that I finally got my rear in gear on this--BEFORE I get so tired from chemo & rads that I just give up entirely.

      "Content": "It sounds like one doctor is talking about a does-dense regime (a higher amount of the drug more often, generally every two weeks), while the other is talking about what used to be (and still is for some doctors) the \"standard\" regime of a lower amount of the drug every three weeks until you have received essentially the same total amount of the drug. There is some evidence that for some cancers a dose-dense regime is more effective at preventing recurrence. Hence, it is entirely possible that the four-month regimen would help reduce your risk of recurrence more than the longer one would. As a result of research showing the potential for increased effectiveness of dose-dense regimens, the NCCN (National Comprehensive Cancer Network) has issued guidelines that include dose-dense regimens in a decision-tree format. You can access those and read them for yourself at their website, www.nccn.org. An oncologist working at a cancer hospital should be more up-to-date on current recommendations, though it is certainly possible that a doctor at a regular hospital may also work to keep up-to-date, especially if he/she is an oncologist. They should be willing to give you very specific information--what drugs, how much, etc., and what all the risks and benefits are. Ask each doctor why they recommend one regimen in particular--how will that particular regimen benefit you? How will it affect your risk of recurrence? What are the risks of that particular regimen? What new research supports a particular regimen? (Get them to be specific if you can--if one doctor is relying on older research, that might not be good, but if the other doctor is relying on brand-new research without solid support (plenty of evidence that a particular regimen is proving to be good), that's not good either. Lots of luck making your decision, Michele! Merry Christmas! Sandy",
