    "Content": "My near vision got noticeably worse when I was on taxotere for chemo. Now, a year later, I'm noticing another big change in near vision. My onc thinks it's not treatment related but is probably age (I just turned 50 this year). I'm sure age is part of it, but this has not been a gradual change, but rather a dramatic change in a short amount of time.",
