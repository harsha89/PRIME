    "Content": "Hey Hounddog, My last treatment was in 2001 and I still get tired. The fact is chemo wrecks your body. When I get tired and depressed (and I take Effexor, mainly for hot flashes) I give myself a mental health day. I don't do dishes, or cook, or clean the house (I'm a stay at home mom--who is never at home -- LOL) and curl up on the couch with my son and watch TV and eat Oreos or any other comfort food. I call my husband at work and tell that I am not cooking or cleaning and if he wants to eat he will pick up something for dinner on his way home. Sometimes that prompts him to take me out to dinner. But the point is, I give myself a break. Sometimes it lasts only a day, sometimes a week. But I believe that it is your body and mind's way and telling you that you need a break. Life will go on if you don't do the dishes!! When I try to do too much, that is when I have will have a break down. It has taken my 2 yrs to realize that and now I try to give myself a break before I have a breakdown. If you are physically well rested, it is easier to handle the emotional roller coaster. As far as it not being fair to anyone that you are tired, IT NOT FAIR TO YOU THAT YOU HAVE BREAST CANCER!! and hopefully your loved ones will realize that and help you out. Wishing you lots and hugs and Oreos bpcbrinks",
