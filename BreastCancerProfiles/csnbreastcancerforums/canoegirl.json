I find that after a week or so of no sleep my emotions get out of control, so I use the Ambien for a couple of nights and that seems to help. I do get a little sleep when my hubby is out of town. Between his snoring and the heat radiating off his body and triggering even more hot flashes I can't seem to sleep when he's here. Of course I'm still not getting a lot of sleep even when he's gone. Does this get any better with time? Do the hot flashes go away? I spend the day exhausted and then as soon as I lay down, I wake up! I think I need to try and get more exercise and see if that helps at all.",

Had them again in 2001 in the same spot and doctor was sure I had cancer. Once again interdauctal hyperplasia. Unfortunately this year I had a mass and 3 areas of casting calcifications and it turned out to be IDC and DCIS with 2 postive nodes. (ER, PR, HER +). Hope yours turns out to be benign, but I can see the value of Tamoxifen if it IS precancerous. Good luck, I know it's hard to wait for the biopsi and results. Hang in there! Hugs, Marcy",
