She said if it was less than that, radiation would be it. I don't want to scare you. I am just saying what she told me. I had the second surgery about 3 weeks later. My personal thought on this is .... I would talk to my doctor again about the margins. If you are not comfortable about what you hear, a second opinion might help you make your decision. Being your own advocate is so important. I am pasting a link here from breastcancer.org. You might find some answers here. http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/diagnosis/margins.jsp Keep us posted on your journey. Prayers and hugs, Mary",

At your age, I am so proud of how well you write and how articulate you are. (I am trying to stay off topic....can you tell?) I can't wait to see the pictures of your adventure. I've never traveled outside of the states. Heck, I've pretty much only been up and down the east coast! You are so much like my daughter. I call her a gypsy. Why? Because it doesn't matter where life takes her, she just slides in without anyone noticing that she is not \"one of them\". I wish I had the hookspa (?) to just go wherever my heart leads me and beyond. OK .. so ... don't let the folks who don't understand what you are going through bring you down. People are like that. They are scared of the unknown. I know this is not something new to you. When I read your note, I started laughing only because I know I would probably write all over my bump with a marker ... I would write the word BUMP on it. Can you imagine the smiles and laughter these folks would get? It's not funny (the bump) but letting others know YOU KNOW they are staring can make it a bit less awkward. I don't know. I am rambling. I wish for you that you take each day by the horns and live each day with excitement and wonderment. Seems to me that you are already doing just that. I tell my daughters this all the time .... Shoot for the moon. If you fail, you will still be among the stars. .... I hope that made you smile. Thank you for keeping us in your thoughts. AND ... KNOW we are all pulling for you and want you to be happy. Kiss the boyfriend for us. It should keep you busy for a while. hehe Love you from afar, Mary",
