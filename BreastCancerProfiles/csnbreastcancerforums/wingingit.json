    "Content": "Lynne, my thoughts are similar to those of DeeNY711. It sounds like pain caused by habitual grinding of the teeth, called bruxism or TMJ. I have it and one of my symptoms is a loud popping of my jaw when I open my mouth wide. My dentist was able to have a night guard made for me which discourages clenching and grinding while asleep. If I forget to wear it at night, I sometimes wake up with jaw pain similar to what you describe. I did have this problem before chemo but stress can definitely play a part. Hope you are able to find the source of your pain . . . Krista",
