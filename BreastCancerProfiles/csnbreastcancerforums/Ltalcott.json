      "Content": "I met with my medical oncologist Thursday. I thought she was going to tell me I needed chemo, or tell me I didn't. But the ball is back in my court. I can 'choose' chemo if I want. I'm healthy and she says I'm an excellent candidate for chemo. I think that means I could handle the side effects, not necessarily that I would increase my life expectancy or decrease my recurrance?? I have two primary tumors, one in each breast, invasive ductal carcinoma. 1.4 cms on the left and .5 on the right. Well-differentiated, sentinal node biopsy showed 4-5 nodes on each side with no cancer. I had bilateraly mastectomies and immediate reconstruction. (Stage 1, T1N0M0) We are going to do the Oncotype DX testing--if my score is <11, no chemo. If it's >25, chemo. But 44% of all scores are between 11-25, and they have no guidelines in that range for whether or not chemo would help. How on earth can I make that kind of decision?! Take chemo, feel awful, get leukemia in 15 years from the chemo, which maybe didn't even do anything? Anyone with experience on \"voluntary\" chemo?? Lisa",

      "Content": "Seof, I knew you were doing this reconstruction this summer, and I was just thinking this morning that I hadn't heard anything from you for a while. I'll keep you in my thoughts. I had bilateral mastectomies and DIEP all in one fell swoop--17 hours of surgery. That was March 4, and I was back at work 1/2 time on 4/13, full time on 4/27. I think I was back on the computer on 3/12 or 13. It's a tough operation and recovery, but I am now beginning to see how these new breasts are really going to become mine, and it's going to be good. They really felt foreign, and the shape isn't the same as my original traiter-boobs. But maybe it's a better shape?? I go in on August 4th to have my \"dog ears\" removed, and to have nipples constructed and tatooing. I know you have read lots here on what to expect. Let us know how it went (in a week or so when you feel like it.) Lisa",

Now I'm on Tamoxifen, and it will be stamping out my hormones to starve the cancer. So when I cry for nothing now, or feel weepy--what do I blame it on? I can't believe my crying jags are over.

      "Content": "Pammy, There are different ways to construct nipples. I just had two made on 8/4, and they are healing well and look natural. They did tatooing at the same time. The doctor cut and rolled the skin up and sutured it. He also put some epidermis with all the cells scraped off, then tightly rolled up, to give the nipple some substance. He explained this all quickly, so I probably have it all wrong. However, I know they didn't graft skin from anywhere. The tatooing didn't take very well, so we're going to go back and fix it, and also I'm going to have my \"dog ears\" taken off. \"Dog ears\" are excess skin that is on each hip from where they took the fat to make the new breasts. Amazing what they can do. Reconstruction, not enhancement, but I look pretty darn good! Lisa",
