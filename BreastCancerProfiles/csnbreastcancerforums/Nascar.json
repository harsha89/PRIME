    "Content": "Boy, can I relate. Believe this, I actually started smoking again after quitting 25 yrs. ago. It helped me to relax and I felt it a better alternative to alcohol or sedatives. How marvelous you turned your anxiety into something so positive. I was ready to quit again when a close friend was dx in 11-05 at stage 4. I'm reliving my own worst nightmare. I'll be ordering your book. I need to stay positive to help her through this. She's so dear and this is sooo heartbreaking. Thanking you greatly in advance. Nascar",
