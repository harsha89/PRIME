    "Content": "I had a lumpectomy in December followed by radiation which finished up at the end of February. In mid-April my \"boost\" site started to itch like crazy and then it spread out from there--you could see the exact outline of the whole breast radiation. Then the rash traveled to my arms, legs, and back. I've stayed away from the sun. Miserable! I have been to the radiologist, oncologist and dermatologist and have been on high dose steroids, which I hate! I will begin testing for new allergies/sensitivities this week. I  know it is \"just a rash\" but it is the most intense itching I've ever known. I can't wear a regular bra and can only do a soft sports bra with soft cotton t-shirts...not great for my job!  I am trying an anti-inflammatory diet to see if that helps. Certainly I'm not the only one who has been through something like this...I know many get a radiation rash at the site, but has anyone had it all over? I do have sensitive skin.    ",
