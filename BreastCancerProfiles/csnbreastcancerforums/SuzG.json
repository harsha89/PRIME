After chemo was finished I had Herceptin every 3 weeks until I had a year total of the Herceptin treatments. I had no bad side effects from the Herceptin. I had to go for the MUGA Scans to monitor my heart while on the Herceptin.",

      "Content": "Gracie - I too had my first round of Zometa. It was in May, and I felt exactly like you did. When I had the treatment, they just breezed through the possible side effects and I didn't really think I would have to worry about it. Well I was totally not prepared for the side effects a day later. I didn't take pain meds either because I had to drive my daughter back and forth to work. I go for my second round in November. I'm hoping it's not as bad, but at least I'll be more prepared for it either way! Sue",
