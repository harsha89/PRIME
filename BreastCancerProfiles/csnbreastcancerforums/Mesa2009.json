    "Content": "Hello A friend and breast cancer survivor told me about this discussion board and I thought I'd give it a try. I was dx with stage 1b bc (grade 2, estrogen/progest + and HER@ neg., lymph node a microscopic amount in one node) and now I need to make an important decision. Should I have chemo or not? Got three opinions and event had the oncotype dx test done and they stated that I MAY not benefit from chemo but if I wanted extra reassurance I can have it. also according to the oncotype dx test I would only benefit 4% from chemo. However, everyone said I would need to take tamoxifin for 5 yrs. They keep saying it is ultimately my choice. I just want to know that if anyone out there has had a similar experience. what was your choice and how have you dealt with your choice. HELP!",
