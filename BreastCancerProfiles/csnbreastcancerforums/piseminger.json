    "Content": "I fully understand where you are coming from. I was always being complimented on how nice my hair look so it was very hard to see it start coming out. My mom cut it for me when it started mass exiting. It was hard, yes I cried and so did she. But the good news is it will come back. Mine started coming in about 1 month after I stopped all chemo. My hair was originally brown. At first it looked like it was going to be all white and I thought oh no Lord not white hair but I quickly stopped myself and said thank you Lord that I am getting my hair back whatever color it might be. As I said at first it is hard, I did buy a wig especially since I was student teaching during my chemo treatments. I didn't want my students seeing me bald. Now 3 month out,from the stop of my chemo, my head is covered with salt and pepper colored hair. I don't wear my wig at home and I actually let my nephews see me for the first time without it on July 4. They never said a word. Now I just have to decide when I will go out in public without my wig. Please know you are not alone in the quest and you are in all of our thoughts and prayers",
