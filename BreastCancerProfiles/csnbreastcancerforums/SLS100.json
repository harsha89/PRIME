    "Content": "I am triple negative. Because tumor was 6.2 cm I had chemo befpre surgery. There is a great chat room here, most people come on at night. Very supportive. I am about to start rad but have only had the intro session so far, waiting for docs to get my start date. The chemo was really hard, and I have some cancer left in the left breast so they will do more chemo after the rad which sucks. Yes, one step at a time is the best way to go. I urge you to come into the chat rooms, people with breast c are common, and have been survivors for several years. I am still new to all this, but am doing ok, You will be ok too!!",
