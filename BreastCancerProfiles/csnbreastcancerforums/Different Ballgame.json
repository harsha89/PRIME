      "Content": "Dear JoJo, I am very angry at the incompetence of the nursing staff when you went into surgery. I do believe that the hospital should receive a letter from you describing what took place. Where was your doctor at the time all of this was going on. Your doctor also needs to be informed. Send letter to the president of the hospital with a carbon copy to your doctor. Your doctor should also be aware of what you went through when the \"newbie\" tried to remove the drain tube from your body. You can send them a copy of this posting telling them that you posted this on CSN but that you did not identify the hospital nor your doctor. Let me know what you decide to to. JoJo, you write very well. If you decide to send them a letter and want some input before it is sent, I would be happy to review it or help you write it. Lots of Hugs, Janelle",

      "Content": "At 65 years old breast mammogram revealed a calcification. Calcification ended up being 0 Stage, DCIS. Two surgical biopsies yield margins that were not clear. An infection developed 4 days after the second surgical biopsy. That was the best thing that happened to me because then I researched for the next 2-1/2 months and sought second opinion. I decided to be extremely aggressive and opted to have a bilateral mastectomy. Mastectomy revealed no more cancer present in breast and sentinel lymph nodes were free of cancer. I also decided to have breast reconstruction, which I am very happy with. Now, three years later a growth appeared on my scar. Plastic surgeon thought, as I did, that it was an irritation to the stitching beneath the scar, but when I told him that by feel (not sight) I thought it might be growing. The growth did not look like cancer, but he then wondered - 50% wondered if the growth was an irritation to the stitch and then another 50% wondered if it was cancer. Now the cancer is Invasive Carcinoma, >95% positive for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor 80% positive, p53 20% positive, and HER-2/neu 30%, score 1+, negative. I have been told that I am very rare, that I am in the 1% category for recurrence, meaning that 99% of the women who have 0 Stage, DCIS never have a recurrence. CT scan, bone scan, and MRI revealed no further cancer present in body; however, those tests cannot detect microscopic cancer. This week I finished 31 days of radiation. Next step is hormone therapy. I am not too thrilled about taking the 5-year hormone therapy pill for postmenopausal women because of the various side effects. I talked to one woman who discontinued the hormone therapy after being on it for 6 months. I never thought that I had the option to say, \"No\" to that treatment. Now, I am curious about what other women have decided. (1) Are there any women who also had 0 Stage, DCIS, and then had an invasive recurrence. What's your outcome? (2) Are there any women who have opted not to go on hormone therapy or who have discontinued taking it? I am a very strong, positive, fun loving woman and love and live life to its fullest. I especially love making people feel special and love making their day. I looked to the positive as a result of cancer. My positives were that I resumed cooking and gave it away to various people...doctors, co-workers, neighbors. I also share my recipes and am a very detailed person when writing out the recipes. I am a very fussy, expensive, high quality, from scratch cook. It is amazing to see how people react to good food. I also ended up adopting one of my doctors, making him My #1 Doctor - adoption also carries goodies for him everytime I see him. It just so happened that he loves food and he is tall and very thin - some people have all the luck. Ha! Ha! I am having a little difficulty with the fact that my initial cancer was a speck - a calcification - not a tumor. With it brought infections, screw ups, and multiple surgeries before and after the mastectomy. I was extremely aggressive and forfeited my breasts because I valued my body more than I valued my breasts and with the mastectomy, based on the fact that no more cancer was present, I would not have to have radiation nor chemo. And yet, 3 years later what I totally avoided ended up coming into my life - radiation and hormone therapy. I do believe that there is a positive reason why the cancer returned to me, but right at the moment, I don't know why. Second time around with cancer is not the same ballgame. Cancer literature seems to be geared more for the first time around. People also are very sympathetic and compassionate with the first time around cancer. The second time around they do not know how to react to you, probably are fearful or just don't know what to say, so based on their reaction, you end up not telling many people and end up feeling very alone or end up feeling like a leper. I never cried the first time I had the cancer. The second time I have come very close to crying, more than once, but the tears do not come. Another thing that is very difficult to find - support groups for women who work. There are tons of programs during the day, but trying to find one near your home in the evening is a search, not to mention the travel distance. Three that I have found are 1 hour away from my house. There is a major hospital in my town (10 minutes from my house) and yet they offer no evening programs for the breast cancer woman who works during the day. Sometimes you want to talk - not write - you want immediate feedback that you get when you talk. That's it for now. I look forward to hearing from you.",

      "Content": "Three years ago I had 0 Stage DCIS - right breast. Decided on bilateral mastectomy in July 2006. Sentinel lymph nodes were free of cancer and no further cancer cells were found in the breast. No chemo No rads required. October 2009 tiny, tiny growth on scar - diagnosed invasive cancer, Grade 2. Bone scan, MRI, and CT Scan ordered in Oct/Nov 2009 - no further cancer detected (HOWEVER, THESE TESTS CANNOT DETECT MICROSCOPIC CANCER - ONLY A MICROSCOPE CAN DETECT MICROSCOPIC CANCER). Hence, I had 31 radiation treatments. Yesterday saw the medical oncologist and decided to take Armidex for the next 5 years. My reaction when I was told that I had invasive carcinoma - HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE! I was told that I am in the very rare group - 1% get a recurrence based on my initial cancer. Second time around is definitely a different ballgame. I guess, just like you, one cell got away. It takes some time to adjust mentally to the recurrence. Second time I experienced some anger. So you also may have many different emotions relating to the recurrence. Second time I want to be around breast cancer survivors. I want them in my life. This is a good site to be on. The women are very caring, supportive, knowledgeable, and funny. Most important, they never act like they are your doctor. Post as many questions as you want. Post whatever emotions you are feeling for the emotional support. Good luck on your appointment tomorrow and let us know what you doctors advise. Lots of Hugs and Lots of Love, Janelle",

      "Content": "A recurrence can happen. Not all of your breast is removed with a mastectomy. A tiny portion of the breast tissue right next to your breast skin is kept to support your breast skin. In that tiny portion of the breast tissue, a cancer cell can lurk and then later develop. I had 0 Stage DCIS but after 2 surgical biopsies margins still were not clear I initially started with 1 speck of cancer known as a calcification. The biopsies revealed under a microscope that the margins were not clear. After much research I opted for a contralateral mastectomy (removal of 1 cancerous breast and 1 non-cancerous breast) with immediate skin sparing breast reconstruction. I did not require chemo, radiation, nor Arimidex, which were some of the major reasons why I opted for the mastectomy. About 2-1.2 years later, cancer returned on scar of breast which I thought was an irritation to the stitches. I touched that cancer for at least 4-6 months never dreaming that it was cancer. I showed it to my plastic surgeon at my annual visit with him. He also thought it was an irritation to the stitches, as it was not shaped like a cancerous growth, until I told him that I thought it was growing within the last month or so. Then he became suspicious. Biopsy revealed that it was cancer. I am in the 1% category for a recurrence based on my initial cancer. That means that 99% of the women who have 0 Stage DCIS, lymph nodes free of cancer, NEVER get it again if they opt for a mastectomy. My comment, \"One cell got away.\" Because cancer could not be found anywhere else in my body with the recurrence, I only needed radiation followed with Arimidex. It is now one year since I finished radiation. So far, so good. My advice to all of you is, \"Do not live your life in fear. Educate yourself as to what a recurrence could look like or feel like. Any questions or doubts, immediately go to your doctor...do not wait for your next scheduled appointment. Focus on all the joys of life and enjoy them.\" Lots of Hugs, Janelle",

I can only imagine this world and this board with you in it. You are an excellent writer and have a wonderful way of expression. I was in awe of the words you chose to tell us about your lump and your reaction. I believe your last words in the posting were, \"Let the party begin.\" I liked its tone. The words are firm and strong. No one on this board can match you with verbiage. I told you in private that I hate the words Warrior and Beast. I think that I am the only person on this board who strongly hates these two words. I refuse to say them and I quickly pass them when I see them in print. How about the word PRINCESS for the women and PRINCE for the man instead of Warrior. Beast is a very difficult word for me to come up with a new word. One possibility could be Invisible Dragon. Dragons can come in many forms, just like like cancer comes in many forms. Cancer can be seen. Cancer also cannot be seen. Maybe someone else has a better word than mine and Beast. I am making a toast, \"To Good Health\". Lots of Love and Lots of Hugs, Janelle",

After one year, it would cost you $500 per breast per tattoo (at least that is what it would cost me,) I had them redone just before the year was up because I wanted the color to last many years. So...consider going a little darker than what your normal color was so it will last many years (since it fades over time). The nipples and the tattoos make a hugh difference in how the reconstructed breasts look. I am so happy that I did it all the way!!!! Lots of Hugs, Janelle",

I said, \"Not a good sign.\" When I asked what pharmaceutical made the drug, the pharmacist had to go on line to find out. Anastrozole is made by NATCO Pharm, an company from India. I did some searching on the internet, found their site and then decided to go Finance to read more about them. Projected sales for this drug this year is estimated to be $750 million. ANOTHER QUESTION: How many drugs are made by companies that are not American companies outside the USA? I decided that since I am doing so well on the brand and since I take only 2 other drugs, Synthroid and a water pill, I could justify paying the money for the brand.",

You also need to fully know and understand the consequences of your decision when you say, \"No\". In addition, you must be able to accept the responsibility of your decision to say \"No\" if the consequences turn on the dark side. The advise all the sisters have given you is sound advice. You need to talk to your doctors/surgeons, tell them your conerns and fears, and ask them to explain so you totally understand why they are suggesting/recommending the mastectomy. My attitude is, \"What's a breast? The body is more important than the breast.\" What do you value? Though, I am a lot older than you. I was 65 with a speck of cancer (not a tumor) and my margins were not clear (O Stage DCIS). I became extremly aggressive and opted to have both breast removed because I also wanted breast reconstruction. There are so many tough decisions to make. Gather all your facts. By the way, I had 3 infections. The first infection came after the second surgical biopsy to give me clear margins. The second infection was 5-1/2 weeks after the mastectomy and 7-1/2 weeks after the mastecomy. The 2nd and 3rd infections called for the tissue expanders to be removed. The infections were more like a Pain in the A**. They just delayed the mastectomy and then the breast reconstruction. Here I am now. Two good reconstructive breasts. Lots of Hugs, Janelle",

      "Content": "I had both breasts removed - one cancer and one non-cancer. There are some other advantages to a contralateral mastectomy. First, you will be symmetrical with your reconstruction. If you keep one breast and have it reconstructed, the following can happen down the road. If you gain weight, the reconstructed will always stay the same but the real breast will increase in size or if you lose weight, the real breast will decrease in size. So if you fluctuate in weight, this is a major consideration. Or...if you are younger, as you age you may gain weight and the breasts will no longer match. If you are big breasted, in order to achieve symmetry the real breast would need to be reduced to match the reconstructed breast. Also, you will have peace of mind when both breasts of removed. What kind of doctor are you seeing? Are your doctors oncologist surgeons? I don't know where you live, but if you live in or near a major city, there are oncologist surgeons in that population. Before you decide on surgery, visit a plastic surgeon to find out what your options are for breast reconstruction. I was 65 years old with microcalcifications. I had 0 Stage DCIS. After 2-1/2 months of research, I opted to have a contralateral mastectomy with immediate breast reconstruction. Ten years ago I had a friend who had breast cancer. She decided to have both breasts removed with breast reconstruction in the works. I thought she was stupid to remove a good breast. When it happened to me, I no longer thought she was stupid in her decision. Being 65 years old, I am mentally alert and was in charge of all my decisions. We don't know what the future holds for us and I did not want to chance it in the other breast, have the beginnings of not being mentally alert, and have someone else then make any decisions with remaining breast. Plus my oncologist surgeon said that I would also have \"peace of mind\". Do you have the option to find another set of doctors? If you do, seek them out for another opinion. Remember, you have the ultimate say. Hugs, Janelle",
