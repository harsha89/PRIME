    "Content": "I received an e-mail this morning from Saks Fifth Avenue directing me to their Key to the Cure t-shirt promotion. The shirt was designed by Marc Jacobs and Charlize Theron is their ambassador. http://www.saksfifthavenue.com/Entry.jsp?sssdmh=dm12.77736&site_refer=EML301B As a breast cancer survivor I frequently wear pink ribbons and other apparel to show my support and raise awareness. This is a beautiful shirt and I was looking forward to adding it to my collection. However, I was disappointed to learn that their Extra Large only fit a maximum 37 and a half inch bust. And after the chemo and the steroids the waist measurement of 29 and a half just would not work for me either. I sent an e-mail to Saks and was informed that there was no DEMAND for larger sizes. If you would like to help me stir up a little DEMAND, please cut and paste the e-mail addresses for Saks, Marc Jacobs and UTA (agent for Charlize Theron) into an e-mail message and let them know what you think. e.migliaro@marcjacobs.com, k.waters@marcjacobs.com, t.beckel@marcjacobs.com, j.sagum@marcjacobs.com, Janine_Bolin@saksinc.com, Julia_Bentley@saksinc.com, berkusj@unitedtalent.com, benedekp@unitedtalent.com",
