      "Content": "I am almost six weeks out from mastectomy surgery and I am still trying to decide treatment. 1st opinion said I could do chemo for 2% better odds or not do it. 2nd opinion said definitely chemo. 3rd opinion said no to chemo. Size of single focus invasion is 4mm. Stage 1 T1a. Extensive DCIS. No lymph node involvement or vascular involvement identified. DCIS is triple positive, invasion is ER-, PR slightly +, and HER2 very positive. Not enough sample to perform Oncotype testing. Genetic testing came back clear. I am 36 with two kids (3 and 5). One doctor recommended TCH, the other recommended ATCH. The one recommending TCH said that they would not recommend A regimine because of the possible consequences to the heart for such a little area of invasive cancer. Not even sure chemo is worth it. I have no idea what to do. I am afraid of the side affects from chemo, but I am also afraid that I could be treating something that is most likely not there anymore (but if it came back I would regret not doing chemo). I hate being in this gray area where no one agrees how to treat me. I know I would love to say to heck with chemo and just do tamoxifen, but what if it comes back? Anyone out there in a similiar situation? I am also worried about delay in treatment. Till I start anything I will probably be 8 weeks out...is that too long? Please give any info or insights. I am just spinning my wheels...........................",

You have been such a great daughter through all this and I am sure she loves having your support. You are also probably such an inspiration to her watching you bravely go through everything you have been through as well. Keep your head up and know that thoughts and prayers are coming your way for you and your family. Michelle",

      "Content": "Well, it has been three weeks since my mastectomy. Healing well physically, emotionally and mentally has been more difficult. Been to countless appointments with surgeon, gyno, and oncologist. Diagnosed with extensive DCIS with a .7mm single focus invasion. First oncologist said that it is not the national standard of treatment for me to do chemo. Anything in any combination (options of tamoxifin, chemo, herceptin) gives me a 2% advantage only. I am ER+, PR+ and Her2+++. I have been reading all over the net trying to figure out what to do. Most say risks outweigh benefits in my case. Don't want to be worried that I should have been more aggressive though. I worry because I am 36 with two small kids and husband. Anyone else out there with diagnosis similar to mine? What were you told? What did you do? Thanks! Michelle",
