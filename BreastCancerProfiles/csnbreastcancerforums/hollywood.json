    "Content": "My original dx (10/00) was insi tu carcinoma but 2nd opinion doc found invasive,single mastectomy 12/00, no chemo or rads & Her 2 neu-0Neg. I don't know if there's a difference in infiltrating & invasive. Weird how all mine came about....cat scan ordered to see about my dizzy spells,normal scan but I found lump after 42nd bday,mammo showed this & micro-calcifications...biopsy showed a small benign cyst but pathologist found carcinoma cells in tissue. Second docs radiologist found the invasive & a sentinel node biopsy was done w/ the modified radical, no node involvement....tamoxifen started 4/01. Pain in joints -etc, I asked for a bone scan....all normal but have pain in hips,shoulders & feet. After 6 mth check-up in 9/01, found small 10mm mass on left ovary,had lavoscoptic assisted hysterectomy.....NO cancer! Does anyone know for sure if tamoxifen can cause bone/joint pain &/or is the combination of the med & no hormones causing my pain? Thanks for sharing & listening.... God Bless Keri",
