      "Content": "Hi everyone ! We have all read articles saying that laughing is actually good for you : it generates endorphins or other little tiny creatures that tickle your immune system. So I am suggesting a joke thread just in order to get those ticklers to tickle. Anyone cares to contribute a joke ? Here are mine : Men talking : \" It's been 18 months since I last talked to my wife... I hate interrupting her.\" Women talking : How many honest, intelligent, caring men in the world does it take to do the dishes? Both of them. How does a man show that he is planning for the future? He buys two cases of beer. Why does it take 1 million sperm to fertilize one egg? They don't stop and ask for directions. OK, your turn ! Big hugs, Cathy",

      "Content": "Hi there! I was extremely tired too when on chemo. I just slept a lot. I tried to drink lots of water; I ate yoghurts, thin slices of ham, otherwise I wasn't very hungry the whole time. I know it is difficult to be so tired, especially when you are usually a very active person. But this will pass : after your treatment, it will quickly fade away and you will regain all your energy. It is important to rest if you can, this is the best way to help your body concentrate on this internal fight. Walking and going out a little bit every day is also a good idea. If you are feeling achey, ask your onc if there is something he could give you to prevent that. I had a horrible nausea during the days following my first chemo, so bad I couldn't eat or even drink water. I talked about it and got some zofran for the next chemos, and that helped me so much ! I hope you will soon feel better. Big hugs, Cathy",
