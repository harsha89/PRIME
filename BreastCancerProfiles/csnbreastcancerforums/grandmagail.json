      "Content": "I heard from the Oncotype lab today and they feel sure that my insurance will at least pay for seventy per cent and the rest can be written off. Even all can be written off, if need be. I have another problem that I'm wondering if anyone has had. My CT scan showed spots on my lungs and in my chest nodes. This has everyone perplexed since my nodes from surgery were clear. They are thinking it may be \"junk\" from the surgery, because of the pattern it is in...just a band across where my surgery took place. The bottom of the lungs are clear and my pre surgery chest picture was negative. They said this rarely happens and I'm on hold for a month, at which time they will do another CT scan to see if things are clearing up or not. This has me a little frightened. Hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving. Gail",

      "Content": "I have two drains. They are more bulky than I imagined, but very easy to empty, measure, etc. You will get them out after about a week. I was up within hours after surgery. I am 64 years old and plan on taking at least 6 weeks off work. I do have a physical job, but they will make it easier for me. Probably a stool to sit on while running the register. I will be doing chemo, so I may need that. This has been a breeze so far, but I can tell that I had major surgery because I get tired and have to rest often. Baby yourself for a while. You deserve it!",

      "Content": "I do see myself in a lot of this also. My sister had so much family stress in her life and developed cancer. She passed away a little over a year ago. We were best friends, in addition to being sisters. So..yes...I really believe that stress has a lot to do with cancer and I do fit more than a few of these traits and so did she.",
