I never thought of myself of a Survivor until I found this site.   I would just say I HAD cancer-   It's great so many are finding this early on-like I wish I had!   Denise",

You can get GSC (guest assistant card) they recently changed the name but it helps people with medical & misc issues-check into it prior to going? Also you can rent wheelchairs or from outside source electric scooter. We always take a mid day break (about 2-3 hrs) at our resort-hang by the pool or just rest in our room.   Have a wonderful trip. I am not going back until July -   Denise aka disneyfan2008  ",
