      "Content": "Hi Karen, My name is Angel. I also had a mastectomy of my left breast, just finished 5 rounds of chemo and am expecting to delivery my baby in less than 2 weeks. I will be on another chemo after the baby and radiation. I did real well with the surgery and the chemo. I was not able to work though. With me being pregnant, they didn't want me under any added stress. I am a teacher and really didn't need to be around children anyway. I wish you the best and if there is anything you would like to know, everyone here is so helpful. My email is ahaney@elp.rr.com if you ever want to chat. God Bless you during this time and always. Angel",

      "Content": "Hello there, I was undergoing radiation during the holidays so I had to miss alot of treatments. They seemed to think it wasn't any big deal..just as long as you have the number you are suppose to in the end. The machine never broke on me..but still missed alot. Good luck and Have Faith! Angel",
