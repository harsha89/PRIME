      "Content": "Hi Annie, Intruding....NEVER....Welcome aboard our survivor's journey. We all keep in touch and share information just as you have done tonight. We share our happy stories, our sad stories and our fears and our hopes and best of all, \"we pray for one another.\" You will find a wonderful mix of people here at CSN. I have formed very close relationships with several that I met here. You heard from Jane and Murphy, two of my favorite people, already and others will respond to you as well. I agree that when it comes to meds, that we must be very careful. I am just starting my chemo, go for my second \"cocktail\" this Friday. My hair is starting to come loose when I brush. but I am determined to not let that hair loss bother me. We'll see how I feel when I see it all gone??? Stay with us and post again, we all need one another. Your new friend, Nancy",

      "Content": "Hello Tiger, You are a real inspiration. Many of us would be feeling low with what you are going through. I wish I had more information for you. The only thing I know is that my oncologist wanted me in a clinical trial where Herceptin was being used to see if was any help to early stage cancer. The Herceptin was to cost $55,000.00 a year and he said he would prescribe it to all of his patients if the cost were afforsable. He believes in this drug very strongly. I did not fall into the trial that will receive the herceptin, however. I wish you well and I will add you to my prayers. Keep in touch with all of us, we do try to support one another. My email is kinkeeper@kc.rr.com if you need to talk directly at any time. Your new Friend, Nancy",

      "Content": "Hello MDavis, Nancy here. I have finished my A/C for ductal carcinoma, 2cm tumor, lumptectomy, 1 lymph node involved, stage 2. I am going to have 3rd Taxol infusion the first Monday in March and then just \"one left\". Radiation will follow. I too, have read about the role diet plays in our cancer, meat especially. I have cut back on meat but have not stopped eating it all together. The dairy is the hardest to live without...cheese is my life...but maybe it is the reason I am fighting this fight FOR my life. Tell me a sample of what you are eating. I eat fruits and veggies and almonds everyday, but could do better. Does your Onco support the herbs you are taking. I plan to do that but not until after the chemo is completed. Write back. Will be anxious to hear from you. This new format will take some getting used to. Tried to get into an ongoing chat but would not let me in. Your friend, Nancy",

      "Content": "Hello everyone, I want to share a happy story with all of you. My white blood count is very low and my onco nurse told me to stay away from crowds, and friends, even family members until it comes back up. This has been very hard not to see my children and grandchildren, especially when the grandchildren ask on the phone,\"grandma when are we going to get to see you again\". Sunday afternoon, I was on the computer when my husband called me into the living room. There in my front yard stood all my children and grandchildren holding handmade signs. The signs read, we miss your kiss, & hurry up and get well, we love you, and each sign the grandchildren had made had drawings and a picture of them on it. I cried of course, happy tears. I went out on the porch and we all talked and then I made each one a bag of candy. Then we did \"air hugs and blew kisses\" They drove away waving goodbye without coming in the house. That was hard to not invite them in but this time will pass soon. I am so grateful for my family and I am also grateful for all of you here on this site.I think I have spoken with most all of you and I love you each and everyone. Your Friend, Nancys",

I have completed the 5 years on Tamoxifen. How long have you been taking Femara and is this the only hormone drug you have taken? Anything you can tell me will halp in my decision. Thanks and big hug, Nancy",

      "Content": "Hello Ulli, I had never heard about Clodronate, so I looked it up on Google. Clodronate seems to be used to protect from bone mets. I read in the New England Journal of Medicine that this is a drug widely used in Europe for 15 years. There is no FDA approval for it here in the US. This was an interesting article and told of a bone marrow test that would find cancer cells and proved 75% of women with BC would have their cancer spread to bone. That was not very encouraging to read and I hope the article's writer is incorrect. I have been on Tamoxifen for over 2 years now and so far so good. I have no new information on pricing the drugs but want to thank you for drawing attention to another therapy that I will discuss with my Oncologist. Welcome to the CSN. Hugs, Nancy",

      "Content": "Hello jean, I think that the Taxol and Taxotere are very similar chemo drugs. My Onco nurse told me that the Taxotere does not produce an allergic reaction as often as Taxol. That is all I have been told about the drug. When I was taking the A/C. my nose was cold and runny the whole time. Lets hope that is what you describe as getting a cold. I did get a bad cold while on the A/C and took a round of antibiotics and it did delay my treatment by 1 week. I just got my LAST Taxol treatment today and will start radiation in 1 month. Keep asking questions of your health care providers and I'm sure Margaret will have better info for you here. Love to you, Nancy",

You mentioned having your burns checked. How bad did the radiation burn you? I am in the 3rd week of radiation and other than a little swelling in the nipple, I see no signs of any change. Stay in touch with the site, others will benefit from your experience. Love to you, Nancy",

This is better, I think, once we are used to it. There were 3 in the chat this morning and I tried to join in but it would not let me receive any response. It came up on the screen that I had joinded the chat and printed out my message but no one ever responded....maybe they just thought I had nothing to say!!! Anyway I got a suprise, too when I came into the site..this will be interesting. Love to you, Nancy",

      "Content": "Hello jill, Kathy and Mariat, Here I am back again after a long absence. I started with the CSN when it first started and it helped me so much. Now here I am five years later and wondering whether to start Femara as my Onco has recommended. I have researched the side effects and they do sound bad. I remember the body aches with Taxol and Femara side effects sound much like Taxol. I am so glad to read your posts and to hear first hand what Femara is like. It is a hard decision whether to take it or not. My insurance does not pay for brand name drugs and Femara will cost about $250.00 a month ( a little less from Canada) Do I want to pay that much for something to make me feel 1000 years old??? Much to think about. Thanks again, Nancy",
