    "Content": "Just remember breast cancer is a disease of the cells in your breast. Until a pathologist can look at the cells under a microscope with special staining they really can't tell you for certain if a something on ultrasound or mammography is cancer. Worse part of it all is going through all of the steps to get to a biopsy results. Don't feel shy about pushing your doctor to expediate the results!!!",
