      "Content": "I think it is very important to share the information of what is available and what we know about the various treatments, drugs. WE all need support, information and knowing the new advances out there. The is places is for the sharing of personal exeriences and what works or not. we check with our own medical teams about the information. Do not need the magic potions, solicitors or quacks. I have posted some medical information on this site and also said where it came from so others can check for themselves or with their docs. I do believe we are intelligent people and we are not alone and we need to know. Roxanne",

      "Content": "Hello When I had been first diagnosed in 2000, I had been engaged to be married. It was hard on him and we have gone through it together. We are married (on 10/21/00.) My spouse has been very supportive then and now with the second dx. There are support groups and your medical team should be able to give you that information and resources. We received booklets with information for the spouses and caregivers from our cancer center. My husband had been through some of this with his mother and sister who had cancer. He is more of a reader rather than a support group person. So he read, and I do know that he talked with his friends who were more at his comfort level. We also held on to our faith pretty tight. Hope things go well for you both.",

I don't know if I will color or not. I have heard about the dying of hair possobly contributing to cancer, but have not read anything yet. This information about dying hair has given me second thoughts about coloring my hair. I am wondering the same things as you are. Donna, Thanks for bringing this up here.",
