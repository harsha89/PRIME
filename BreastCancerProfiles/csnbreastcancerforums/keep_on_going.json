    "Content": "6 years ago I had a wide excision biopsy (lumpectomy) followed by axillary node dissection. The surgery has left me with 1 C-D cup that's a little scarred but perky & 1 DDD plus. I was thinking about reduction surgery on my non CA breast. I would like them to match somewhat & I am tired of wearing a prosthesis. I was told by my insurance company that they would not cover the surgery. If I had had a mastectomy, they would pay for reconstruction. But they would not pay to make me equal in appearance. Has anyone else had this problem? Any suggestions or resources out there? I find it hard to believe that since I didn't have it all taken off,I am being denied a surgical procedure that would restore my equilibrium. Breast sparing surgery comes with it's own set of problems",
