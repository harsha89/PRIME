    "Content": "My onchotype was 45, did 4 rotations of chemo, now in my first week of 8 weeks of radiation. You can do this. I went horse back riding today, did a 14 mile kayak last weekend. Have had to work a 40 hour week all through my treatments, have not missed a day even after any of the 4 surgeries. I have a very physical job and cannot take any narcotics. All you can and have to do is one day at a time. Take care.",
