    "Content": "When I discussed removing everything with my GYN she wasn't in favor of it. Sort of the \"if it's not broken, why fix it?\" attitude. I wasn't interested in taking that long to recover either so I had the laproscopic oophorectomy (sp-I never am sure how to spell that one!) That was one of the options presented to me-the others being Lupron shots or chemo-no thank you. I was not menopausal at all before that but I certainly was instantly after! Instant hot flashes but not bad ones. I started the Arimidex shortly after surgery and am dealing with it's frustrationg side effects. There's no one decision that fits all of us-we're all the same but different-which is just one more of life's challenges. And one more reason I'm glad we have this message board to ask questions, seek advice and sound off. Good luck with what ever you decide. If you are like me, you just want to get it over and move on.",
