    "Content": "I too have a hard time with waiting. Diagnosed may18, invasive pleomorphic lobular carcinoma (IPLC I think.) After tests & consults We chose Lumpectomy, Thursday I see the Dr for pathology report. I'll find out if I am finished with surgery or face another Lumpectomy or a masectomy. I know I'm ER+ & PR+ & lymph nodes are clean. I'm sore & colorful. I feel like I'm reved up, prayer supported ready to run a race- Just not sure what kind of trail I'm on or where the path leads only that the starting gate is visible over the hill of tomorrow. God be with you during this time of waiting.",
