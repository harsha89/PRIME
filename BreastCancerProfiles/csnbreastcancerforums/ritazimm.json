      "Content": "WOW Eil, I cannot imagine not sleeping! I would REALLY be a basket case. I do take Ativan to relax me so that I can sleep and I do sleep very well, but I am always tired even so. I don't know how I would be able to function if I didn't sleep! My heart goes out to you. I'm one that hates to take meds to be able to sleep but I hope that they can find something that will work for you. Before I started chemo I also read that chemo does not cross the blood-brain barrier. That is a bunch of crap! I fully believe that it is 'old school' information. I have been seeing a therapist lately and she said that the research is showing that this is no longer thought to be correct. There are too many people that have 'chemo brain' type effects that they no longer think that the drugs fully bypass the brain as previously thought. I actually am a clinical trial coordinator and I am hoping that you get some good results. Usually there is some type of 'rescue' option when a study has a placebo arm so hopefully that will be the case in this study. If not, keep in mind that in any study, you are free to stop a study at any time for any reason. So if you are suffering even more by being in the study, I would encourage you to withdraw consent so that you can get a known treatment. Youy body needs sleep as well as rest. Good luck!! Rita",

      "Content": "I felt the same way when I found this site filled with wonderful women (and a few men). It has been such a blessing to me to know that there are others that really can relate to my thoughts and feelings. I thought I was crazy - and maybe I am, but if I am I have a lot of company. :) I'm not a party person so I really can't help you there, but I'm sure you will find something special to do. I too find that sometimes the little decisions are harder to make than the big ones. My 'chemo brain' finally seems to be improving, but my poor hubby had to make ALL of the little decisions on his own because my brain was just too exhausted to make any 'more' decisions. When I got on the right medication, he knew the second day that I was better because all of a sudden I started to care (voice my opinion) about the 'little things'. I'm still not sure if he was happy at that point or not but I didn't ask because I didn't care. :) Congratulations on surviving all of the treatment. God bless, Rita",

      "Content": "Hi Jackie, I am sorry that your loved ones are so self-centered. I have experienced both sides of this coin. I have 5 brothers and sisters and most of them have been very supportive. I don't know what I would have done without their support! All of them live in different states but their love, support and prayers have really seen me through. But I also have one brother that has called me one time (possibly twice) over the past 18 months since I told everyone about my diagnosis. For YEARS I have also reminded him that he has some responsibility toward our mother and father and that just a phone call, a couple of times a year, would go a LONG way at easing their worries about him and his family. He is also a minister so he is fully aware of Gods view on this but it does no good. I have stressed about it for years as well because I am the only one that lives near my parents (I'm the youngest) and I therefore am the only one that bears the front of their anxiety over him. But since the cancer, I have realized that I will no longer let the behavior of others upset me. Not his poor behavior or my parents anxiety over it. When my mother starts ****ing to me about him, I just tell her that I have no control over him and that she should just get on the phone and call him to complain. I have also given up on thinking that he will change. I have no idea what his issues are, but they are HIS issues and not mine so I cannot change them. I have realized that I am taking on too many things that I cannot change so I am giving them up. Of course this isn't easy to do but it is one of the few things that I have learned from this terrible beast. I am done enabling others to upset me. Even thouse that I love. (Now that I have said that, let me give a possible excuse on my brothers behalf. I have written a blog so that my family and friends could know what is happening with me so that they wouldn't have to call me all the time wondering what is happening. He might be reading my blog and keeping up with what is happening with me, but he has not commented or called about any of the good or bad things that have happened. So much for no longer being an enabler, huh?) I am so sorry that your family hasn't been supportive and are so very selfish. I cannot even imagine the hurt that they are causing you. Even though you love them dearly, try not to let them hurt you. It really is time for you to focus on yourself and the people that are helping you through this. If they cannot be there to support you now, then they just beed to be put aside for a time and just focus on yourself and those that are there for you. And the hardes part is DON'T FEEL GUILTY FOR DOING THIS!!! You need to keep the positives in your life and purge as much of the negatives as you possible can. Good luck and God bless! Rita",

      "Content": "It definitely hurts to see how many self-centered people are out there and of course it is even worse when it is family. I guess I can make excuses for those that haven't been through it because they obviously have no clue, but I cannot find any reason to explain those that have been here. (My sister had breast cancer 2 years before I was diagnosed. When she told us sisters, she actually apologized for \"bringing it into our immediate family\". Talk about thinking of others. Of course we told her to forget those thoughts but I too had them when I was doagnosed.) I guess many people just can't see past the nose on their faces. I'm sorry that you all have this additional hurt to deal with on top of everything else. I would love to be your sisters and show you how much you are cared about and loved! God bless you and heal your hurts! Rita",

      "Content": "I'm not going to be much help to you since I had ACT chemo and no herceptin or Taxol. But I did have radiation and after going through the chemo first, I thought the radiation was a breeze. I Did have continued fatigue, it started during the chemo, but it was less than during chemo so I was thrilled. I had 25 radiation sessions and was just starting to have the skin burns/reactions the last week or so. I didn't have much pain or itching (just a little). My Rad Onc. gave me specific lotion to use because some lotions contain particles of metal so you need to avoid these, but use the lotion they give you as often as possible to keep the skin as supple as possible. As far as feeling 'normal' again, don't pressure yourself too much about it and if you aren't progressing as you think you should be, talk to your doctors about it!!! I really expected my life to get back to 'normal' very soon after I completed my radiation, since that was the end of all of my treatments. But, I was having many 'chemo brain' issues that I wasn't aware of prior to ending treatment. I knew that I was forgetful, distracted, etc, etc. but I thought it was all of the activity and treatments and that this would go away as soon as I completed. It didn't and my medical onc. just kept saying, \"give it time\". I waited way too long before seeing a psychologist and starting the hunt for the right medication. 1 year later, I have finally been on the 'right' medication for me, for about 1 month. I am now trying to catch up on all of the things that I didn't even notice were undone for the past 18 months. But..........I am very thankful to have both a body and a brain that are functioning as they are supposed to. :) God bless, Rita",

      "Content": "I have not had many side effects with the tamoxifen. Vaginal discharge is probably the only one that I can guess was from it and the others - was it the tamoxifen or all the other side effects of getting older. (I'm 48 but was thrown into menopause from the chemo so is it the menopause that caused the hot flashes, etc?) But I am HAPPY to say that it did NOT make me gain weight! I was very afraid to switch to the Arimidex for fear that it would cause the weight gain since the tamoxifen didn't. So far I'm staying the same weight (which is 30 pounds less than before cancer so I'm happy!) but I've only been on the Arimidex for 2 months so I hope it doesn't change! That is one side effect I'm not sure I would be willing to take and I imformed my doctor of that prior to taking the Arimidex. My grandma lived for 20 years on tamoxifen. They don't treat with it that long anymore unless that is all someone can take, but it really worked well for her. She even had bone mets and brain mets and lived another 10 years after the brain mets was diagnosed. Can't ask for more than that in my opinion. Good luck!",
