      "Content": "I have been going through radiation for the past 4 weeks. I have 9 more to go, so 9 more days (they were closed today for the holiday). I have not suffered any burns or irritation, at least not yet. I also completed 6 rounds of TAC in early May. I wanted to attack this with everything I could. I never knew or asked what the percentage is with me doing chemo and radiation. I had 2/16 lymph nodes involved and a left simple mastectomy with expanders placed at the time. I'll have my expander exchange in the near future. Then, I have decided I won't be monitored every year, I'll be monitored every 6 months. I'm not waiting a whole year! But, I didn't care if it was 2%, it was worth it. I can say I did everything- rene9",

      "Content": "Hi everyone. I had my 1st radiation yesterday then I had an appt. with my medical oncologist. She said something that kinda startled me. Now, it has been 4 1/2 weeks since my last chemo and yes I think I see potential...But, she said it's not time for me to have hair yet? Does she mean real hair? or chemo hair? I was lost and did not ask any questions...Now, I'm thinking in the next few weeks I might see something...Maybe, maybe not huh? I know I need to stay out of my head, but I'm ready and anxious...I do see sparse hair and it is also growing sparse in other areas...But, isn't it almost time for hair??? rene9",

      "Content": "Hi, I'm a Sped teacher for K-5 students and I had surgery 3 weeks ago. I doubt if I go into detail when I go back. Sick is sick to my group and they are very helpful when they feel or see something is different or wrong. The kids have sent me cards and they are wonderful! I didn't even go in detail with all of my co-workers. Although, if anyone has questions I will tell them what is going on. Then, they think I wear a wig sometime anyway. My administration is supportive with my care but she can say some crazy stuff at times, so I limit a lot of conversation. I actually feel pretty good and when I go back to work I'm ready for all questions, but I'm not the one to volunteer information ... rene9",
