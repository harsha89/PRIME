      "Content": "I waited until my hair started coming out all of the sudden in big clumps, then had my husband buzz it. Then after it got fairly sparse decided I was tired of looking like my 88 year old wispy headed grandpa, so I shaved it slick. I did that a couple more times later as random wispies would show up, but haven't messed with in a month and it's still slick as a cue ball. My last and final chemo was 8 days ago (woop woop!). The morning after that last chemo, I arose from bed, looked in the mirror pointedly at each and every follicle on my head, and with a voice much like that of Zeus proclaimed, \"Let the follicular recharge....BEGIN!\" .... I guess that didn't work. I'm still slick bald like a cue ball. But I check first thing every morning. :)",

      "Content": "I was excited but pretty scared at the same time for my first one, too, earlier this summer. But, I went anyway and was so glad I did and so glad I walked to Survivors Lap! It really was so cool to be included in the group of purple shirted Survivors and think, \"yeah, I've really accomplished something!!\" And it was so awesome and inspiring and encouraging to hear each Survivor state how long they've been a survivor, then step up to the mike and state my own Survivor statement, and then be able to walk that lap with all of them. I felt only good emotions, and just couldn't quit smiling the entire lap. It just felt gooooooood. :) I still can't explain what I felt about the luminairia. I saw my own, I saw friends' and family members' who are battling and who have already passed,... I don't know, it just really hits you. It just made me want to fight harder, live stronger, and be more involved in the fight against cancer. It was emotional, but in a very good way. You can do it!! :)",

      "Content": "Hi. Anybody out there have experience with adopting post-cancer? I'm still doing chemo, but am getting close to finishing and the outlook is great. We can't have kids, so are wanting to adopt. We were going to start on this over a year ago, but got derailed by my diagnosis and treatment. My husband wants to go ahead and get started with everything now, but I'm thinking we'll \"look better\" as potential parents after I'm in remission, have some hair, don't look quite so much like a cancer patient, etc... Anybody been through this or going through it or know anything about it? I don't want to wait forever, but don't want our application to get thrown in the trash after they come to do a homestudy and are greeted at the door by a scrawny sickish bald woman.",
