    "Content": "Have any of you heard about RIBP?  I have just received the diagnosis.  Symptoms are lost of feeling in the hand and/or arm, pain and muscle weakness.  I'm told this is a rare effect from radiation.  There is no cure and we don't know how far the nerve damage will go.  I'm just wondering if anyone else has knowlege about it and if there is something that has worked to reduce the pain. ",
