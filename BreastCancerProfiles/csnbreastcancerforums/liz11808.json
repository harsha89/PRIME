      "Content": "Hello Cindy, I am also going back to work on June 30 and my last chemo is on Friday. I have at least 3 weeks to rest and worried to face all the people at work. I know there's going to be people that will be curious and will ask question but for now I am thinking about my last round of chemo and the possible side effects of it (my 3rd is not so good). I hope everything will be OK when you go back to work. God bless, Liz",

      "Content": "Hello Kit, I had a left breast mastectomy and stayed overnight in the hospital. I didn't sleeped the whole night so I decided to go home the next day. There are 2 drains that needs to empty every 8 hours and the amount must be recorded. I brought this at the time of my appointment to check the fluid on the surgery site. 5 weeks after the surgery, I started my chemo of 4 rounds (taxotere/cytoxan). I'm done with it and will start harmone therapy in 4 weeks. It will be your decision if you want to stay longer in the hospital, let your surgeon know. With the drain, the nurse will teach you how to do it. You can use all the help you need during this time. You will be in my prayers. God bless, Liz",
