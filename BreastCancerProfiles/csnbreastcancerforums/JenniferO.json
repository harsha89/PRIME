    "Content": "Yes - I cannot believe how many people have this problem! I had my doctor give me a sleeping pill and I'm still up at 2 a.m. every night because it wears off. I just got an extended release version (yay!) so I'm hoping that helps. Once I'm up I can't fall back asleep either - it sucks! Give into to the meds - they will help you.",
