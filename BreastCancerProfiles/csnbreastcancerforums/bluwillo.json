      "Content": "Oh, Beth, I still get (am) scared, but I try really hard not to let it rule my life. I was really lucky that during diagnosis and treatment, I was also going to college full time. Also, helping my DH run our business. I thought if I ran fast enough, the cancer would say \"Dude, we can't keep up, we're outta here!\" LOL! See with which disdain I regard cancer? Anyway, after I finished school last month I have a little more time, so a little more room for the fear. Thankfully, tho, I have less to be afraid of now. I feel like I've been there, done that and totally have the scars to prove it! I know now that whatever comes up, I can get thru it. (Oh, and I never allow myself to go into my room, curl up in a ball on the bed, and vow never to leave that position. I know when I feel like doing that, the fear is winning...so I start a new project or divert myself. I talk to myself ALOT! LOL!)",

      "Content": "Yes, you...standing over there chewing your nails and hunching your shoulders up, face all pale and scared looking. c'mere. Let me tell you something. YOU NOT ONLY SAVED YOUR COUSIN'S LIFE, YOU MOST LIKELY SAVED HIS DAUGHTER ALSO! Insert major hugs and the good Puffs (with the lotion, don't you know!) here. You did what had to be done, sure, it was a difficult decision to make, but it was the right one. Good for you! Now, onto the legal aspects (it's one of my hats...I am not a lawyer but work with these kinds of cases). Depending on your state, someone has to press charges. Here, law enforcement does this. We'd charge her with Domestic Violence, and any other crime I could find that involves assault on a disabled person. Part of that charge is a \"no contact\" order. That means she can't contact her dad (hard for him, good for her) in any way. What did the police charge her with? In our state, she'd be put in the Juvie division, but that doesn't get her a lot of slack when it comes to assault. And finally, mom and dad both need to advise Friend of the Court of daughter's incarceration. It will make a difference in the child support, and certainly the parenting time. Sounds like a little time institutionalized followed by foster care (no one in the family...this chica sounds like a master manipulator) until she ages out of the juvie system. But all this aside, remember...you saved (hopefully) two lives. \"Someone saved my life tonight, sugarbear\". \"member that? it's from an old Elton John song. Blessings!",

      "Content": "This is my first visit here (wish I would have come much sooner!) and my first post. I found SPF 50 SPRAY ON (!) sunscreen at Walgreens. The bottle I got was labeled for kids, but I compared it to the exact product for adults, and all the ingredients and amounts were the same. So why did I buy the kids? Cos I'm broke and cheap!! The kids bottle had a free 33% more in it! And I wanted spray on because I hate smearing stuff on me. Also, in the \"I'll find the good in this cancer cr*p department\", our Walgreen's sells Hallmark cards. Hallmark now has a line of breast cancer stuff...they have an olive green baseball cap that says \"One Tough Chick!\" on it. Guess what's sitting on my head right now? And, guess who gave it to me? The cosmetics lady at Walgreen...she's been on this journey with me since I was diagnosed last year. Her sis had died 4 days before...so there was more crying than usual in the Hallmark aisle that day. She said the hat would look perfect with my red cowboy boots (which another friend had given me to kick cancer's butt). I don't know how the cancer feels about the boots (like I care!) but they sure made ME feel better! In case you haven't figured it out yet, I am very mad at the cancer and refuse to give it any positive vibes at all. I'm in a war with it, and will use anything to win, mostly my sense of humor.",
