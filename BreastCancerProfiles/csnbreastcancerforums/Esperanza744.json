    "Content": "Hi, I am also a nurse and am wondering if you know anything about having chemo prior to a mastectomy.  None of the protocols I have reviewed mention chemo although on these boards I see it referred to. I have DCIS and all of the protocols only mention radiation and breast sparring or mastectomy.  If you can direct me to some information or research I would really appreciate it.  I am a baby nurse so am way out of my depth her.  The Oncologisttold me I have Stage II/III. Everything I have read tells me DCIS is very \"curable\" but I am concerned about the chemo first.  I have been overwhelmed by the massive amount of knowledge thrown at me.  I would like to do some reading that would help order the information in my head.  Thanks in advance.",
