    "Content": "RUN DON'T WALK to your doctor, Shelrae. Crusty nipple was my only symptom for a year and my dr. had me putting cream on it. After reading something on the internet, I became insistant on treatment and in January I was diagnosed with a cancer called Paget's Disease of the Breast. I had a mastecomy with a TRAM reconstruction in February and I just finished my third of four cycles of Chemo yesterday. Don't let the dr's disregard this, especially with your history. I am wishing only the best for you. Please keep in touch. Lyn",
