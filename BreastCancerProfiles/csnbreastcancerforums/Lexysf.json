    "Content": "Hello Luv, i hope you're doing well. i'm in the same situation as you are. i had lumpectomy 6/16 and was diagnosed with dcis with 1.7mm micro invasion, triple negative.  rad onc recommended 6wks radiation But med onc says no need chemo but if i prefer to have chemo he would support my decision.  do you mind telling me if you went ahead with the chemo? I am having a hard time deciding because I'm worried about the side effects and the dr told me that the chemo would help me by only 1%.  ",
