      "Content": "Hi all I have had my 4th and last ac treatment last wk friday. I start taxol and herceptin next wk and my heart rate still feels so fast every morning. My resting heart rate used to be around 70 but now its more like 96 and when I walk from the parking lot into the office it gets up to around 120. Ive been a runner for 18 years but have been away from it since early april. I know ac is hard on the heart and I know that when I run my heart rate gets up to 160 170 but its so unnerving to have it race like this. My mugga scan was really good the first time and she is repeating it on wed. I take xanax to settle down so maybe its a combination of anxiety fatigue deconditioning and the chemo. Just curious if anyone else experienced this. Also...Is taxol/herceptin equally hard on the heart THanks for listening Linda T",

But my paper thin hair which was crappy to begin with is really falling out now. I see my niece at 3pm and she will shave it for me. But you know even with double mastectomy chemo and everything when you have your hair you can still look in the mirror and not see cancer. Now that is all I see. I dont want this to define who I am. I truely feel like I am still grieving some but maybe this will get me into some kind of acceptance stage, I dont know. Anyway the tears are still coming, not all the time but today is hard. I will see my counselor at 5. Thanks for being there Linda T",

I tried to take 400mg ibuprofen but really needed to take 800mg 3 times per day on day 2 and 3. I actually even worked 1/2 day on monday which I never could do with ac and worked 8 hours today which I havent done since I was diagnosed. It is so much easier for me anyway.

I dont remember, are you getting chemo or radiation or both?d Either way, my best advice to you is to listen to your body when it tells you you need to rest or take a nap. My head tells me I can still work 50 hours per week, jog 4 times per wk and take care of my family but I am here to tell you that chemo can kick your butt. You need to be sure not to do too much or push yourself too hard. The goal is to get thru the treatment as easily as possible which means you need to rest during the treatment. Let us know what the plan is and remember we are all here for each other Hugs Linda T",

      "Content": "Boy what a saga...Sorry you have to go thru all of this...I truly know how hard the delays can be. I had bilateral mastectomy in May with tissue expanders. I developed a wound onthe right side and my plastic surgeon actually debrided it and packed it the day my port when in. I had a 1/2 open area with a hole about 3/4 inch wide which I was packing 2 times per day. I could actually see the expander in the wound when I looked inside with a flashlight. I saw oncology about 5 days later and she pretty much told me no chemo until the wound was healed so I saw plastics the next day and he took me to the or on 10mg of valium, numbed the breast and took out the expander while I was awake, placed a drain and closed it up. I was 7 weeks out of the original surgery before I actually started my chemo. I should have started on week 4. Did I mention that having a tissue expander out locally was a HUGE mistake. I cried thru the whole thing...but thats over now. Oncology did tell me it was safe to wait up until 12 weeks and I am in chemo now. The tissue expander gets to go in sometime next year then I can start reconstruction. Waiting is tough...for me all I could think of was that there were stray cells migrating thru my body ready to invade something so I know how you feel. I would by the way stay away from the gym. Get an exercise bike, some light weights, a dog to walk with and buy a yoga tape. If you were active before I truly think that its a huge plus for the fatigue. Its helped me alot. Hang in there...your infection will clear and you will start chemo and we will be here to help you...stay active as much as you can but dont overdo it. Hugs to you Linda T",

Kinda depends on the chemo they give you though. The first round for me was adriamycin/cytoxin which made me pretty tired and a little nauseated. My appetite was kind of down and my energy level not great. Chemo is accumulative so fatigue can be a problem. My advice would be to stay active and exercise every day because it truly helps the fatigue. Just have to be watchful...chemo brain sometimes sets in so you have to be more focused with what you do.

I am so glad you felt that you could vent a little. I am relatively new to the board but I see you as someone so very strong and together. YOu are always there for all of us it is nice to be able to be there for you. I have always felt better with exercise, walking the dog with a neighbor, biking or when I was able I would jog.
