      "Content": "Chemo side effects always kicked in n 3rd day for me. It wa like having a flu bug achy joints some nausea very tired. i ended up having to do neulasta after each chemo tx. I didn't like very sweet foods and salty foods tasted awful. i always wanted cold and crunchy. Baby carrots, apples and oranges. I know one day i ate 6 apples. It was kind of like a pregnancy craving I have no idea why. When i went to chemo I'd tell myself I can do this today. each day i woke up I gave myself the\" I can do anything got 12 hours\" pep talk. I had to have someone come and help me do my bills. After first round I sat down and paid bills but neglected to transfer money out of my savings. good luck you can do this",
