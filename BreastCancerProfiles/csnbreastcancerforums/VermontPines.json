    "Content": "Kit, Most hospitals have someone who acts as a go between with insurance companies. Not a billing person, but rather, usually like a social worker, nurse administrator, or some other title. They're also very familiar with the requirements and 'cultures' of the insurance companies they deal with and they can give you a good idea of how amenable your own company is to extending your stay. Most are flexible about the length of your stay - you may have to have a reason for a stay that is longer than the 'suggested/approved' time, but these can often range from a rise in B/P that needs to be watched, pain control, etc etc. Your surgeon can be a big help with this - just discuss it with them beforehand. As far as the drains go, the usual one is a JP drain, and theyre easy to deal with. You'll be shown how - ask them for a printout though, because, like cabbott said, you won't remember. You should also check your insurance to see what it covers for a home health nurse. Many cover them now for surgery, but each is individual. Your surgeon can arrange for it, and the home health service will know what the requirements are. My local hospital was excellent at getting me a fourth day for a radical hysterectomy, along with making all the arrangements for a visiting nurse. Just let people know. And good luck to you!
