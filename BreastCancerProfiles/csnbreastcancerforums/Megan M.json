When I started my boosters, the rest of my skin started healing pretty fast.  Keep using your creams even after your done with rads as you are still \"cooking\" for a few weeks.

Many women will also have a final weeks booster treatment using electrons, to the tumour bed site alone. Radiotherapy to the breast can be given in 15 - 30 treatments, depending on the factors listed above. It is normally given once per day, monday to friday. More advanced linacs have the capability to deliver another type or radiotherapy treatment that is used to treat areas that are on, or close to the skin\u2019s surface. This treatment uses electrons instead of high energy x-rays (photons). My skin got a little more tender, but, nothing any worse than what it was with just the rad treatments.  Are you using lots of creams? Hugs, Megan",
