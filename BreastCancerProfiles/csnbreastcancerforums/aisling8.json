I don't think it's that big a deal, but like Chen, I'm a child of the sixties... Do you have adult children? I can almost guarantee they can find you a source.

      "Content": "Dear Pink Sisters,  November 1st, it's that time of year, our annual ornament exchange. I hope people will come out and play\u2014that means you, you, and, oh yes, you:)  If you'd like to participate, please PM me with your real name and address (or you can remain anonymous if you wish, but I'll need the address) and I'll send you a name and address in return. It's great fun as people begin receiving their ornaments and posting about them.  This is a tradition that our beloved Chenheart began and since it was her lovely idea, I'll let her words explain it: Hey Kindred Spirits~ it's that time of year again! Last year, as many of you know, I organized ( not well organized, but yeah...) an ornament exchange here on the BC boards. If any of you is interested in participating, please PM me with your real name and address~ when the list grows, I will pair you up with another warrior from the boards. We have almost no rules, so let me address what was asked of me last year, to hopefully make it easier for new ones this year! If you want to remain anonymous, that is completely up to you! If you do not want the recipient to know who the ornament is from, that is just fine. Conversely, if you do want them to know, include your name and screenname! LOL These do NOT have to be expensive! That is the nice thing about ornaments, they can be purchased quite reasonably. Also~please do NOT feel that participating in this has to have a spiritual or religious connotation. We have Christians here, lapsed Christians, Jews, Muslims, Athiest, fill in the blank, and they are pretty much represented here. An ornament need not depict anything religious... last year I got an ormament from one of our Kindred Spirits in Texas, and she sent an ormament in the shape of the state! Like me, I am sure you have seen all sorts of ornaments; wine bottles, surfboards, teddy bears, candy, pink ribbons (!!!) the list is endless. Sometimes, the participant lets me know that they are part of a certain faith, in that case I let their Secret Santa know. Conversely, if someone says they do NOT celebrate the holidays per se, but want to exchange ornaments, I will let that be known as well. This was a lot of fun last year! We had a good time thinking about what to get one another, wondering what and when we would get our ornament from someone else, and it connected us in a wonderful way which touched us in ways that cancer cannot. It was a loving, fun, upbuilding way to join hearts. So, if you want to be a part of this, PM me! I need your names and addresses, which I PROMISE I will keep safe and not share with anyone else!!!!! I think that by December 1st I will have to say No More Names!!! I hope to have enough names to start pairing you up by mid-November, and you can take it from there as to when you mail it! Hugs, Chen♥    ",

I was called back for another mammogram and ultrasound on January 18th. Surgery was FINALLY on March 4th. Drove me nuts. I honestly thought I could feel cancer cells spreading, moving in all over my body. The surgeon thought I was nuts. I thought her staff took too damn long to arrange things. You know the end of the story: it all worked out. Lumpectomy, clear margins, clean nodes, low Oncotype Dx score, radiation almost over (8 to go). It was my own head and heart that caused me problems. Get well so the doctors can take care of you. You will be fine. Victoria",
