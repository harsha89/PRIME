Perhaps they will on my post too, so I won't ruin it. I looked at the word for a while, imagining the missing letters till I figured it out. Dang. That was a good laugh. If the censors didn't get it this time, look below for the version I saw. Weigh****chers. Hee Hee Hee, Joyce",

I did go to the bra shop for women without and get pads for both sides to try to even out my profile. Better, not perfect. And as far as the weight gain goes, I am not surprised. I am sure that my plst. surg. is using cement, not saline on this breast rock I have. But as far as swimming, I think not. First of all, without the bust building foam I would look weird indeed and with it I would float till it soaked up water like a sponge, and then sink like a rock. Wow, the image of going under and having to shed my breasts to save my life is just a little to close to what has actually happened in my life! Mimi, loved your attitude. I did a little strutting today in my new bra. As a \"smaller\" woman, I have always considered padding to be cheating, but tempting. Now I can say its not vanity, it's a MEDICAL necessity! So there! Pass the clingy sweater, please. love, Joyce",

But if you look back, you will see a post like yours from me asking what to expect as I went into the taxol. It just have been so nice to know! Honestly, though, one of the good things that came out of this awful BC DX was learning to take it one day at a time. It got my through TX and as a wonderful parting gift is helping me enjoy my life every day afterwards. Do not tax your body in anyway during your treatments with a weight loss plan that isn't completely healthy, and doctor approved. Our bodies are working so hard already to get us through chemo. Remember to love yourself during this time. And plan for weight loss later. I used to fantasize about how beautiful I was going to be when my hair grew back (and my toenails - you may lose those from the taxol). The fantasizing was a way of soothing my body and self. love, Joyce",

Your body has been through a lot and is a good friend. Just listen to it, do what you feel is good for it, give it what it asks for and thank people politely for their advice. You have earned the right to be your own boss now. I wish you all the best! love, Joyce",

And do not think that the scar you see now is the one you will get. Mine continued to fade for months and is pretty unnoticable now by comparison. But please read on for other opinions. love, Joyce",

I do not know if cells were found in my blood stream. Getting both a Pet Scan and a bone scan were normal procedure. I had the same treatment as you, two weeks apart followed by radiation. There were times when I thought my onc. was trying to scare me a little. Later I found out that she just wanted to be sure I didn't opt out of chemo/rads like some people do. Opt out, heck, I was glad to get them. I already thought I was gonna die. I can't believe that some people would not be scared %^$*less (my censor) so for me the tough talk just wasn't necessary to bring me down to brass tacks. I wish you good things, and good news.

I am moved to do this thing because you are already following this advice. It is as follows: What ever you are forced to do with this treatment, look for a way to do it that will bless you, your family, or others. This is what has happened with your hair cut. It is some kind of triumph, huh, when we can take something not so good and find in it some good and bring that forth. Congratulations to you and your son for your style and thanks for reminding me to have a little more too! love, Joyce",

But I wanted to say when I got my DX, had my mas. went into chemo menopause, knew I would be taking tamoxifin I felt like I was swapping in my female card. I was sure that scary things would happen to my sexuality not to mention my looks. Well, they didn't. I am still me. I still strut my stuff (though I only have half a deck!)and I still feel feminine. What I want to say is that I think all these things sound scarier and more damaging than they are. One of my friends, who is no slouch, had a hist. years ago and she is still very beautiful (and a little too active for her own good!). My yoga teacher who is gorgeous casually mentioned she had a hist. a long time ago. I am just typing all the good stories I can so that maybe they can counteract some of the scary images that we can so easily dream up. Courage, darling, and one day at a time. Don't worry, you'll always be Heather the nut! Oh, and I did get hot flashes but they are almost completely gone now. Meanwhile another friend who was naturally menopausal is still going through year two of hers. I wish you ease, hope, health and beauty. Love, Joyce",

My husband had to run out and buy it because I forgot to plan ahead and the underwires were forbidden. I also sent him out for some soft dressing pads. My doc. said I could use sanitary pads against the wound, but I didn't have the heart to make my husband buy me both a bra AND feminine protection in one trip! Also, this is a very small detail, but I have found that if I take a long, wide, ace bandage and make a sash (wrapped twice or more) for my waist with the drain held against my skin, I feel much more secure than having the dang thing dangling, and it is easier to dress around too. It is now four days since my surgery and I walked several blocks today and feel very much over the hump, though I am still quite tender and careful. I wish you an easy time of it! Take care, love Joyce",
