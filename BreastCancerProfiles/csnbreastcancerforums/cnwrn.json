    "Content": "Hi: Before you read my experience, remember everyone is different, and my was unusually severe. The first cycle of Adriamycin/Cytoxan went well. I also had a pre-treatment dose of Aloxi and Decadron IV, and had taken Emend. The first 2 days were fine. I thought, this is great, no problems. I was then nauseated for about 5 days, and then tired, but feeling mostly OK until my next treatment. I did also have diarrhea, but not frequently enough to be worrisome. My treatments were scheduled 2 weeks apart. The second treatment was again OK for 2 days, but I was tired and severely nauseated with dry heaves for the next 2 weeks. I had no appetite or thirst. I had to force myself to eat and drink. When I went for my 3rd treatment, they took one look at me and post-poned it for a week and lowered the dose. I felt a little better just by the time the 3rd treatment came. That treatment nearly did me in. I got to where I couldn't eat anything but baby food peaches and then I couldn't even eat that. I could only get chocolate milk down (and I don't even like milk). That is what kept me alive. Water tasted rancid. I had to get IV fluids a couple of times. My 4th treatment of A/C was cancelled, as were all of the Taxol treatments. My oncologist said \"it was beating me up too much.\" I asked if this was unusual and he said, yes. The oncology nurses also said it was rare to cancel the treatment. I am an RN, but sometimes feel stupid because I don't know much about oncology (I'm am a medical/surgical nurse), but I have learned a lot more than I ever intended to on the subject! My oncologist said that it was the accumulative effect that I couldn't tolerate. But as you can see in the postings, not everyone has each treatment get worse. I hope you don't have any trouble with yours. My last treatment was Oct 10th, and I still have some weakness and fatigue, but my taste is back and I am able to eat. I lost 40 pounds during the fall from the chemo (at least I could afford to lose it!) Take Care, Cathy",
