      "Content": "Chemo and other treatments are always a choice and I would do whatever I could to reduce the risk of recurrence. My tumor was 1 cm with negative nodes and I had a lumpectomy in 2008. We didn't Oncotype because of timing and Onc. felt chemo would be the only choice since I was nearly triple negative (ER/PR/HER). I had 4 rounds of C/T which was fairly well tolerated. Hormone therapy is usually not recommended for triple negatives, but my oncology group suggested that anyone with at least 1% ER/PR positive (I am 5% ER positive) should get whatever benefit possible from taking hormone therapy to reduce the risk of recurrence. I chose to take h. therapy for 5 years. By the way, I noticed you're in San Antonio - I'm in the Temple/Killeen area. I love the Riverwalk!",

Because I was triple negative and some other markers indicated the cancer may be agressive, the Oncologist recommended chemo and radiation to reduce my risk of recurrence. According to him, there was no other option. I started chemo 3 days later and side effects have been minimal. Good Luck.",

Insertion of the IV was not pleasant but I was lucky to have the same nurse each time who did a good job and used different veins in either arm. On treatment day I listened to my iPod and read magazines. Afterwards, be sure to drink lots of water, eat small frequent meals and rest when you feel like it. Sounds like you have a good attitude about the situation and I'm sure that will help. Looking forward to hearing how your day goes. Good luck.",

I used Aquaphor and Silver Sulfadiazine (prescribed by Radiologit) with self adhesive guaze to decrease the friction under my arm. One week after treatment ended the area was greatly improved. Oncology Radioligist said most experience burns after the third week and that's when mine started. She also said women with larger breasts tend to have more of a problem. My breast tissue is changed after radiation (more firm or rigid) and I'm told this is normal. Good luck!",

Turns out it was dry eyes for which Thera Tears (over the counter) was prescribed. Seems to be working. I have dry mouth and dry skin also. Oncologist said chemo took the moisture out of my body and he felt it would get better with time. I always talk to my Onco. about new problems and I encourage you to do the same. Good luck!",

Lymph node biopsy was negative. 5% positive receptors. Breast Surgeon and Oncology Radiology recommended lumpectomy and radiation. Medical Oncologist recommended mastectomy and chemo. I chose lumpectomy and radiation. Has anyone had varying opinions? What's treatment for recurrence? Who treats me after radiation?",

I finished treatment in December 2008 following a diagnosis of invasive breast cancer in June 2008 and it was less than 1cm. Read all that you can and ask questions because in the end it is your decision on treatment. There is lots of information on the internet, but be sure to visit reliable sources like MD Anderson, Mayo Clinic and this network because we've been there. Hope to hear from you often. Good Luck!",

Side effects are relieved by over-the-counter drugs, especially Aleve, if taken on a daily basis. My Oncologist said I could take a \"vacation\" from taking Arimidex - 2 days off Rx each month. He said there is a residual effect from AIs and that some of his patients have seen a benefit of less side effects. Has anyone tried this or Oncologist recommended? If so, was there a change in side effects?",

Your surgeon probably meant in the case of clean margins that no further surgery would be needed. I had Stage 1 b. cancer and lumpectomy with clean margins followed by radiation. Radiation was done in case there were stray cancer cells in that breast. I understand your anxiety because I have been there, but I just finished treatment and know that I did all that I could to reduce my risk of recurrence. Good luck!",

I had 4 rounds of C/T with IV anti-nausea meds and a sedative. I was drowsy the day of treatment and never became sick. Fatique which was a cumulative effect was my biggest problem. A diary was kept during the first cycle following treatment and each subsequent treatment presented the same problems on about the same days. I rested often, ate small frequent meals, kept a positive attitude that it would be finished soon, looked forward to week #3 when I would feel somewhat normal again and visited this site often for information from those who have been there.
