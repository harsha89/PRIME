      "Content": "I recently had my first mammogram since treatment - I had a mastectomy on my right breast with 2 small tumors (1 cm), one lymph node involved and numerous DCIS and then chemo. I jokingly asked the technician if I'd be charged half price - she said \"Of course!\" LOL Anyway, when she came back to tell me that the radiologist said that everything was fine, she said that I had numerous microcalcifications in my left breast. I thought that microcalcifications were \"pre-cancerous.\" Does anyone have any information on this? Should I worry? Sometimes I wish I had had a bilateral mastectomy, but I didn't even know that was a possibility. Although I don't really want another mastectomy, I really really don't want to go through chemotherapy again! (But would do both in a heartbeat if it meant a longer life!)",

      "Content": "Hi Jomama54, Do you knit? There is a great pattern online for knitted prostheses, but they're called \"knit *its\" if you get my drift. I don't remember the web site, but the instructions were free. They recommend \"weighting\" the knit *its with a small (or larger) lucky stone. I made several, but they all came out too large - I donated them to my local cancer center. Good luck! Libby",

      "Content": "My side effects were about the same for each infusion. I never got anything new after that. I got thrush(?) every time, but knew how to recognize it and start treatment for it earlier. Psychologically each treatment got easier for me because I knew what to expect. The one symptom that got worse each time was the fatigue. By the last treatment I was dragging, but also exultant knowing that it was the last. After my third treatment, I received Reiki Therapy as part of an experiment one of the docs at my cancer center was doing. It was amazing. I needed no additional anti-nausea drugs after that treatment (I had been averaging about 3-4 pills in the days immediately after treatments. My energy also seemed to come back much quicker. Unfortunately the study was concluded and I was unable to find anyone to provide the therapy on my next three treatments. I would have to say that my first treatment was by far the worse for me as I kept waiting for something else to happen. I didn't know what to expect. As it turned out, my thrush got really bad after the first treatment because I didn't know what to report. I still had it going into my second infusion - the thrush got into my vocal chords so badly that I couldn't talk - made teaching a drag! One of the side effects of the thrush medication gave me severe gut pain and back spasms because of it. I ended up going to the emergency room at 3 a.m. After that initial treatment, I was much better prepared and knew what was coming. I didn't like it, but I knew I could handle it. One thing that really helped me with my treatments was keeping a journal. Then I could go back and see when my throat started getting sore or when I was so tired I just wanted to hang out on the couch. The journal made my journey less frightening for me when I could look back and see that the side effects do go away. I had six treatments of TAC every three weeks, so the third week after treatment was good - I could eat and taste again! Then I went back and did it all over again. Sorry I rambled on so long. I hope some of it helps. I wish you the best of luck in your treatments. Just know that you can do it and we are all here to support you! Libby",

      "Content": "My husband reminded me of a suggestion from a friend of mine who is a chemo nurse. She told him not to cook any of my favorite foods the first two weeks after chemo as I would not like them as well after treatments due to the association. So we set up a rotation of foods that I could easily tolerate especially during the first two weeks, avoiding my favorites. I'm sure it got boring for him, but he never complained. Once my taste buds started to come back after about two weeks, I craved salty foods first and then just before my next infusion sweets. I pretty much ate what I wanted for the couple days just before chemo. and then it started all over again. I never want to see tuna noodle casserole (went down real easy) or shephard's pie again. But then, we never had it much before cancer. I wish you well in your journey! Libby",
