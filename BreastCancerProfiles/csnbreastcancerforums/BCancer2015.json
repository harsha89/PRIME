    "Content": "I was diagnosed a few weeks ago.  I found a lump in the axillary Tail of Spence tissue.  A number of people said \"most lumps are nothing, maybe you should wait and see if it goes away\".  Obviously, glad I did not take that advice.  Biopsy came back cancer.  I don't know anything more yet because due to the location a larger biopsy could not be taken.  Surgery scheduled for next week to remove it and the node closest and to 'test, test, test'....  Size wise it is under 1 cm or was when the mri was done a couple weeks ago.  It hurts a lot and I am looking forward to it coming out.  Some of the people who I have told are saying things I just have to nod to and walk away.  \"It's no big deal, everyone I know has cancer\"  \"All my friends have BC, they are all fine now.\"  \"You are strong, you'll be fine.\"  \"I'll come visit, it will be fun.\" \"My co-worker just got her port removed, she is fine, no issues.\"  \"Everyone has BC these days.\" \"Your tumor is small, you get it out and you'll be fine.\"  \"You can't use cancer as an excuse for not wanting to......\"  The hell I can't, I say!  You never understand until it happens to you and now I honestly feel badly about some rediculous news item I had sent a very good friend re: BC a few years ago.  She did not survive and I miss her everyday! I have a number of friends who also have cancer, albeit different types, and I am finding compassion and understanding from them.  I find this so valuable and appreciate every contact I have with them.    ",
