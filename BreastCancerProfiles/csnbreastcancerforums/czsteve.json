    "Content": "I have been diagnosed with Breast Cancer metastisized to my bone Stage 4 in Aug. 2009. My first diagnosis was in 2003 and had a double mastectomy, chem, rads, etc. I just went thru radiation and taxotere, herceptin and zometa. I still will continue with the herceptin and zometa for now. The oncologist stopped my taxotere a couple of weeks ago. Not sure why other than low WBC. I trust my oncologist very much but am confused right now. My oncologist ordered an MRI which I had on Saturday due to my slight pain in my upper left femur and pelvis area (this is the area that my BC had metastiszed to in August 2009). The results of the MRI were that a new lesion was found (2.2 cm) on my right hip. I am devastated that the cancer has spread again to a new area of my bones. Any input out there of hope would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Peggy",
