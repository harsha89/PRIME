    "Content": "I've had bi-lateral mastectomy,expanders put in, normal 8wk A/C tx.,and into 3rd week of 12 on taxol. I will say that so far the easiest part for me was the mastectomy, drain tubes where the pits but had basically very little pain or discomfort after they came out. Hope you have the same experience. Be sure and find out ( if you aren't given instruction) how soon and what kind of gently stretching you can do at home. It does help. Those steroids do a number on us for sure...Congradulation on finishing your chemo. Get some good sleep.",
