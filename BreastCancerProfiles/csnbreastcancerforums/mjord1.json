    "Content": "I was wonderinfg and hoping that someone might have thoughts for me about treatment for HER2 positive but very small breast cancer tumor?  I had a mastectomy 1 week ago for what was originally diagnosed as complex DCIS, but the biopsy just came back as invasive, ER positive, PR negative, HER2 positive tumor along with the original DCIS.  My oncologist has told me that he won't recommend HER2 treatment (like Heceptin along with chemo) because the tumor was so small - 0.8 mm - and he doesn't know of any clinical research on treating HER2 positive tumors that are under 2 m..  This scares me to death because I've read how aggressive HER2 positive cancers can be, and the increased risk of recurrence also to other parts of the body.  Has anyone experienced this or have any thoughts?  Thank you so much.",
