    "Content": "Hi - I had my first treatment of AC yesterday. It went fine. The anticipation of the whole thing made me nervous. I felt a little queasy last night and threw up a little, but that was because I was drinking a lot water which, believe it or not, gave me heartburn. I also ate saltines. I was fine after I got that out of my system. I had taken my meds earlier and didn't lose those, but the doc told me to call her if I started vomiting. She told me to melt an Ativan under my tongue. That did the trick. I felt fine - queasiness went away and I got a good night sleep out of it! Someone who had been through chemo before suggested accupuncture prior to my next treatment. She said it really helped. Anyone else out there tried it? I feel ok today - not 100%, but not bad at all. Please anyone out there who has tried the acupuncture give me some feedback! I am interested in hearing about it. Thanks, Maureen",
