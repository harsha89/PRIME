I also used different bras as my treatments progressed. I used a sports bra with a zip front and then went to a barely there bra - very light weight. At home I went without. I did get red but never blistered. The one thing I did have was extreme fatigue. I ended up having to take 2 weeks off from work at the end of my rads. And then started back at 4hrs per day and increased hrs biweekly. I hope this helps you some. Good luck and keep strong. You will  make it through! Hugs, Georgia",

The radiologist read them immediately. The tech came back and said that what was showing up was a \"fiber fold\". There was no need for an ultrasound and I should just come back in a year for my next mammo. I hope I never have to go through something like this again. I think my husband was even more worried than I was. When we got out to the car after the appointment he broke down and cried. This is not something he normally does. Of course, he then said \"living with me was like russian roulette\". I agreed and we both laughed. I have a follow up appointment with my surgeon in a couple of weeks so I will see what his reaction to all of this is as well. Hugs to All, Georgia",

It is a good form of exercise but it is not hard on the joints, etc. I go 3 times a week for 1 hour and it has helped me sooo much. When I started going (before BC) I had a really bad shoulder and could barely lift my arm. It started getting better and then I had to stop going while I did rads. My shoulder got worse again. Since I finished rads and was able to start going again it is almost back to normal. I can actually lift my arm up over my head! I also lost weight! Hugs, Georgia",

He heard the words no one wants to hear \"You have cancer\".  The good side of it (if there can be one) is that of the nine polyps they removed only one was positive. He will be going to see his urologist on the 29th so they can discuss the treatment plan. I have offered to help in any way I can since he is already caring for his wife and now has this as well. Thank you all for your prayers and good thoughts for him. Hugs, Georgia",
