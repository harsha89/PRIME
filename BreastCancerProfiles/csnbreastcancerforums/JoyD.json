      "Content": "I just got back from my Oncologist last Tues. As you all know, they found my cancer cells in my lymph nodes (2 of them). Anyway, had masectomy on left side on 2/26. Had an appt w Surgeon on March 4 and told me that out of 16 lymph nodes, only the 2 original Lymph nodes had cancer and both my husband and I were happy about it. Then last Tues, had an appt with Oncologist. He told me that my cancer cells in not behaving the way it should be. My cancer cells is called Muscinous Carcinoma that should be a slowing growing cancer cells. Somehow, pathology report showed that it was positive in my blood vessel. I was devasted with the news, as if something hit me again! He said he would like me to go through a PET scan to see where the cancer had gone. I will have the PET scan tomorrow and I am scared of the result. He is also doing an aggressive treatment for 20 weeks => AC x 4 (every 2 weeks), followed by T x 12 (every week), then finally radiation for 6 weeks. He was also asking me if I would like to sign-up for the clinical study of Avastin. Although, it will be a 50/50 chance of getting it. I agreed to do it since if I get the Avastin it will lower the chance of the cancer coming back since it block off or cut off the blood vessel of these nasty cells. I don't know what to expect and I have slept since Tues night. Any comment about this? JoyD",
