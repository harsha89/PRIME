    "Content": "My husband left to go work in China not too long after I started Chemo. I went through most of 24weeks of chemo and 7weeks of radiation while he was living in China. I had stage 3A breast cancer. I'm into my 5th year of survival. And I pretty much did it alone. It sounds like you are alone too. Even if he is in theory there. It does count for a lot not having to worry about insurance and medical bills. But, sometimes you just need somebody to get you some bread and milk from the store! Focus on what YOU need! Gather some people around you you can depend on. That so called freind trying to get this jerks attention, would be getting some attention from ME! How DARE she! Damn vulture! Lay low for now, and get through one crisis at a time. I wouldn't make any huge changes until you are done with treatment. You need to survive financially too! In the meantime.. I would be laying some groundwork for the split. Check into your states divorce laws. Maybe see a lawyer and lay the groundwork for what you need to do. Financial records..etc. Can you get alimony? Most places if you have been married 10years or more you also get 50% of his retirement fund.",
