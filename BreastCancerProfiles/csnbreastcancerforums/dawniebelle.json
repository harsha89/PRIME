    "Content": "I developed a frozen shoulder 3 weeks after a right masectomy, tram reconstruction, and 6 sentinel nodes removed. I was doing well until then. The pain was excruitating. The worst was anything that caused you to reach behind you. Reaching into the back seat of the car from the front was impossible. To bathe I had to sling the washcloth over to the left side . At the worst stage I could not lift a glass or reach for one out of the cabinet. I still only have approx. 85% pre-surgery use without pain. It still throbs with overuse or rotation to the back. My surgery was 3 years ago. Get a good ortho who believes in rehab for frozen shoulder. Mine didn't.Get answers and don't give up. My ortho said it was a small price to pay for being alive after cancer. It was the worst part of my cancer experience from surgery to chemotherapy. I share this hoping you will learn what not to accept. Good luck",
