      "Content": "I was diagnosed with stage 3A breast cancer in July. I was strongly encouraged by my oncologist, family anf friends to go through every treatment plan available. Every morning when I woke up, I felt my heart just break when I thought of going through chemo. After much thought and soul searching I decided against doing it. Will I regret it down the road? No. I have great peace of mind in my decision. My family and friends and even my oncologist have all accepted and respect my decision. I am going through radiation and hormone therapy. That along with the mastectomy was acceptable for me. It is a very personal decision to make and an extremely hard one. I wish you well.",

      "Content": "Gloria, I'm in my 5th week of rads and have been feeling nauseated for about 5-7 days. I kept thinking that maybe I was starting the flu. Then I remembered your post. I asked the nurse at radiation today if she had other patients comment about being nauseated. She said she has had a handful of them and that typically they were all having radiation on the left side. The stomach is on the left side. To her knowledge, this symptom has never been medically acknowledged. Acknowledged or not, I think it just very well may be from treatment. Thought you'd like to know that you aren't the only one.
