I had radiation ... the Canadian shortened type but not the extra reincision but each type of cancer and margins differ mine were not even specifically stated on the path report and we had to keep personally calling the surgeon and he said he went back and took out more to get a clear margin but it really made me mad that it wasnt even inthe path report! Mine was DCIS estrogen and progesterone positive so now am on tamoxifin but getting another opinion about that soon ...... Sue D",
