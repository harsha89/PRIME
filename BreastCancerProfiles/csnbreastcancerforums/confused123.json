      "Content": "Hi Traci, Have you been on here for years?  I feel like I remember you but without the pic.  Anyway I find your post so interesting and I will have to look for this study.  My grandmother, her sister and my mom and I were all diagnosed with Breast cancer.  My grandmother was diagnosed on her 60s, my mom in her 40s and I was 33.  My grandmother and my mom's sister also had ovarian cancer.  We tested negative for the BRACA gene too and my doc told me in must be in some other gene since it seems to be genetic in my family.  I am so looking forward to getting answers and better treatments being the mom of 3 little girls.  Thank you for sharing this study!",
