    "Content": "Has anyone here taken the chemo called Xeloda in tablet form? I got an email from my girlfriend today and she said this is her latest treatment option. She started last week. She takes the pills twice a day for 14 days and then rests for 7 days before starting the cycle again. She didn't say how long this will go on. Does anyone know if there are \"success\" stories using this method? Since everything else they've tried seems to fail, and her counts continue to rise, is this a \"last ditch miracle drug\" or will there be other options if this ultimately fails, too?",
