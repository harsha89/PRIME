      "Content": "I agree with Derbygirl. We know the choices suck. None of them are fun choices. But radiation is the standard of care. Do you want \"sub-standard\" care? Plus, if you were to have a recurrence, would you look back and wish you had done the rads? Clean margins are good but they are not the be-all end-all to cancer. It only takes 1 stray cell. I am sorry for the tough words but if you think your choices are limited now, well, a recurrence will limit them even more. Or open them up to the choice of chemo cocktails. However you want to look at it.",
