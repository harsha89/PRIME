    "Content": "Just want to add my 2 cents. I am so sorry that you have to go through this, but at least you have found this board and all of us who can help and support you. I had a Mastectomy in 1998, had no one to talk to and was not aware of this board until much later, it was a great comfort to be able to talk to someone that had the same condition. My surgery went well, I had hardly any pain, just some discomfort under my arm and numbness, my only regret was that I waited 1 year for the reconstruction ( Tram Flap) but I did not know it could be done at the same time. I find after all these years just the scars bother me somewhat sometimes, a little tight, so I stretch my arm and do some excercises, that works. They way you are feeling right now is OK, it is normal, but I assure you it will get better. My thoughts and prayers are with you for a smooth sailing through your surgery and a speedy recovery. Don't forget to keep us up to date. Hugs coming your way em",
