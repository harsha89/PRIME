    "Content": "Just need someone to calm irrational fears. Only 23 long family history or breast cancer. Found a lump went in for ultrasound then for a mammogram waiting for the results. My question is why if they are able to see it that day can't they give you answers? They say not to worry but how can you not? Doctor already said they were sure it's not a cyst. Figured enough people here have been through it thought maybe someone here would have a better anser then the doctors. Thanks.",
