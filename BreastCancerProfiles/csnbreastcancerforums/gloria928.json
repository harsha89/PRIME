    "Content": "I am also a breast cancer survivor, with the cancer going to my liver last November. I truly hope that what your doctor says is true, and it is just a \"fatty\" liver. The tamoxifen didn't work for me, as my doctor says or the cancer would not of spread. I was put on weekly taxoter treatments for 6 months and am now for the first time in 3 1/2 years in total remission. I have also had a weight problem all my life. But recently I have found that if eat a little something every 4 hours or so (not to much of the good stuff) and do a little more walking since I can't do much more because of problems with some of my joints, I find that i have been losing weight. My metabolism seems to up more since my stomach doesnt seem to think that it doesnt need to store food any more. Give it a try I hope it might work for you to. God bless",
