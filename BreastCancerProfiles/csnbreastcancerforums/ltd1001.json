    "Content": "The problem has been told to me through my dad and is that the medications she is on are making her hallucinate, difficulty sleeping and crying a lot. Also, my brother's friend's wife underwent a mastectomy and is on medication that has completely changed her personality...she is very mean to her spouse, so unlike her. Has anyone heard of meds doing this? If so, I would be so grateful to know what you did/how did you cope with this?",
