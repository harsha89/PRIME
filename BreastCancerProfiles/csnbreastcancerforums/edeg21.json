    "Content": "Hi Eleanor..I just joined this site and I have to agree with you on your feeling about the hair. Mine was short and I kept cutting it shorter. Once the pain in the hair got too bad, I shaved what I could, and then went to a barber. What a great guy! He fixed my mistakes and didn't charge me at all. While I don't like the bald look, I have to admit to not missing the care that hair needs..no washing, drying, styling gels!! Same with leg shaving and facial hair! Hats in the winter a good, but I found myself being too fussy! I like baseball caps and conductor style. I don't like scarves because it accentuates the roundness of the my head. I didn't get a wig..don't know if I will. maybe if I go for a job interview when my chemo is over..we'll see. I hope you are feeling better. Take care, Donna",
