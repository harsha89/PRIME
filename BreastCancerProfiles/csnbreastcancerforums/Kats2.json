      "Content": "Jazz88, Do you have periodic bloodwork done by your Oncologist? If so, your Calcium, Vitamin D should be checked. I was taking supplemental Calcium and my level was getting too high. My Oncologist told me to stop the Calcium immediately. I\u2019m also on Letrozole. What drug is Femara? I\u2019m on Ibrance with Letrozole. Also, if your Oncologist really feels that you do need the Calcium and D, he/she should be telling you directly how much of it to take each day. That\u2019s their job. How are you supposed to know the proper dose? Hope these suggestions help. Good luck!    Kats2",

Hope you feel better...Hang in there!",

      "Content": "I'm glad that you insisted that more testing be done when you knew something wasn't right. I'm also glad that you had scans and x-rays before your surgery. That wasn't the case for me. I also have Invasive Lobular BC. No scans were done on me before my lumpectomy. I was put on Arimidex and had 33 radiation treatments. 1  1/2 yrs later the BC was in my bones. So I'm dealing with keeping it there and not have it spread further. They say that women with ILBC respond very well to anti-hormone pills. I'm on my 4th one. I wish that I could stay on only one forever, but that's not how cancer works. My wish for you is that all your BC is gone! Just make sure that a good Oncologist follows you carefully and that you have blood tests that monitor your BC and also get periodic scans and tests. Keep up that wonderful Be Positive outlook!! It really helps! I'm rooting for you!  Kats2",

      "Content": "Hi Beepositive, My guess is that you'll be put on Ibrance with either Faslodex or Letrozole. That seems to be the first-line drug treatment combination used now. This new drug combo hadn't come out in time for me to get it, so I was put on the older drugs, Arimidex, Tamoxifen, then last of all Faslodex. My BC resisted these drugs so I was put on Xeloda, a chemo pill. I've been on Xeloda now for 21 months. I'm starting to resist it a bit so my dosage had been increased. If my tumor markers continue to climb, I'll be put on Affinator with Aromasin. I was told that Ibrance is out for me now as I've already been on 4 other hormone inhibitors. I've heard good things about Ibrance though. I do believe it's for both pre and post menopausal women. There are many anti- hormone choices out there for you. Good luck Beepositive! By the way, I'm post menopausal and have ILBC with mets to bones only.   Kats2",

I do better with the oral chemo drugs. I tolerated getting the shots in my buttocks but I had nausea and just didn't feel well on the drug. Everyone's different though. I wish you good luck with  it.

      "Content": "Hi jpteacher1, After my lumpectomy in 2012 and radiation treatments which ended in 2013, I was on Arimidex for one and 1/2 years. I had no side effects that I recall except maybe a hot flash here and there. My sister also was on both Tamoxifen and Arimidex for 5 years with no problems. I was taken off Arimidex when bone mets were discovered, bringing me from Stage 2 to Stage 4. My then Oncologist did NO bloodwork on me in terms of looking at tumor markers, nor did he send me for any scans during this period. My new Oncologist feels that I had never been in remission and had the bone mets from the get-go. I'm on Aromasin and Afinitor now and receive Zometa infusions to strengthen my bones. Zometa has been a Godsend for me. My current Oncologist watches my tumor markers and sends me for periodic bone and CT scans. So far my BC is strictly in my bones. But, speaking for myself, Arimidex was a piece of cake compared to other drugs that I've been on. I'd go back to this Estrogen Inhibitor in a heartbeat if it was an option. Unfortunately Arimidex didn't halt my bone met progression. Give it a try. It's stood the test of time. I'm also 68, have arthritis, and most probably osteopenia. I'd take Arimidex anytime if it would stave off any cancer cells that may be lurking around looking for a place to nest. I want to add that Aromatase Inhibitors are used for Est+ BC with or without lymph node involvement. It's a good preventative drug to take. Would you rather wait and end up with chemo?? That's a whole other ballgame!! I wouldn't hesitate taking this drug if it would help me.          Good luck with everything. Peace. Kats2 ",
