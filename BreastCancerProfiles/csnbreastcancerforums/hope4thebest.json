      "Content": "Just wanted to send some support, this illness does suck. I had a bilateral mast/ reconstruction and my body has cooperated, so far. It still is strange, never will be the same. Throw expectations and judgement out the window, it is unfair to put those pressures on ourselves. During my surgeries, I took things hour by hour. That helped me, I never asked about healing time, or any such estimates. We are all different, no-one can predict how our bodies will respond. Keep the faith inside you. When I had my surgeries, I took down my mirror, it is still down because I am not comfortable with my appearance yet. Modify your life, and keep writing, we are here for you. Aloha.",
