      "Content": "Looking at other discussions, I did forget about the effect of Taxotere on my arthritis (osteo). It was tough, but dr. changed my arthritis med and gave me pain pills. I now use Tylenol ES for the pain, which has receded to pre-chemo levels. See other discussions too. Indigestion had started for me before the Taxotere, and onc put me on Nexium for it.",

      "Content": "I had 6 treatments of Epyrubicin (sp?), Cytoxin, and 5-FU, followed by 4 treatments of Taxotere. The anti-nausea drugs that were administered WITH the chemo worked very well, and I had no nausea at all. Taxotere continued to fatigue me, made my fingernails very hard during and for about 2 months after (and now they are weaker than before all this started).",
