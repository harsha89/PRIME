A two for one? The Zeloda is to treat the other nodes....would like to hear from any of you pink sisters on this drug.... Needless to say we were so disappointed to get the news that the drug not working....We were so bummed....hopefully it will work for others.... I had my rads simulation yesterday..I was really worried that I would have to have the wire mask that is bolted to the table for head and neck rads...but nope! What a blessing and praise God! But My arms will be in a somewhat strange position.... Have no idea where this new journey will take me...as my Oncologist says...\"triple negative bc is a nasty beast\"....but I've had my pity party and between now and next Tuesday, I'm gonna rest, relax and get my game on! Let the games begin! I'm exhausted so it's time for bed.... Hugs to all, Nancy",

For stage IV bc...it's, so far, been then game changer for me......my tumor markers are now 34.... normal range....I still have chemo every 3 weeks...I can deal with that.... I guess what I'm trying to say is, don't be lulled into thinking a mastectomy ensures you'll never have to worry again about bc...not true....most don't ever have a recurrence but it's a possibilty.......sadly once we have bc, for most it never leaves our minds.... you have to remain diligent.... And every decision has to be made for what one feels is right for them.... Wishing you the best in your decision....please keep posting....we care Hugs, Nancy",

I had a total meltdown in my oncologist's office one week before the end of treatment...kept asking, \" what do I do now?\". After months of chemo and rads I couldn't wait to be finished but scared to death for them to end...felt like I had been fighting for my life for months...it has taken me such a long to feel somewhat normal...and find joy in the things that I did before bc...don't know if this feeling of dread will ever leave...

      "Content": "I wish you well with your second chemo. Everyone is different, as they say. I am having my third chemo Monday,July 27. I have been lucky so far, I have not had one bit of nausea. I start on prescribed meds(Decadron, which is a steroid and anti nausea med) the day before chemo, and it is continued for 3 days post chemo along with Zofran for 3 days post.Then I have Compazine to take if needed. Before my chemo drugs are administered, I have 20 minutes worth of anti nausea meds administered and then they wait for 15-20 minutes for them to \"kick in\" before they start with the \"BIG GUNS\". I am taking Taxotere and Cytoxin.....perhaps it is a difference in drugs that we each take, that make some sick and others not. Biggest SE for me is the altered taste buds. Nothing taste right for about 5-6 days, which makes me not want to eat, but I do. I do have bone pain due to the Taxotere and the Neulasta injection. The first injection of that kicked my butt big time! Second injection caused minimal pain. So it remains to be seen how the third infusion will go. After that, I only have one more to go in August........YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Again, I wish you well....hugs to you!",
