      "Content": "I had my excisional biopsy last Friday..and at home waiting for results call today. That's what my BS said..probably today. I have taken this week off to recover and I was hoping to get caught up on my school work. But I am having such a hard time concentrating especially today. I sit down to do my work and I end up on these boards... so I'm going to set my timer for 10 minutes then when it goes off I will turn OFF the computer..I'm just rambling..a friend was supposed to come over today and we were supposed to have lunch and do a small amount of shopping but I havn't heard from her..so I'm waiting for her as well..ugh. Thanks for letting me vent..:) I'll post when I find out.",

      "Content": "I had 2 area of clustered microcalcifications. I had myself convinced it was cancer. I had a core needle biopsy and it should atypical lobular hyperplasia...which is not cancer but increases the risk of cancer up to 7 times ( that's what my oncologist told me today...I've read online more like 4-5 times)...I had an MRI and I had another excisional biopsy and they did not find anything else yipee! So now my onc is suggesting Tamoxifen for 5 years just to prevent cancer. All that to say TRY NOT TO WORRY..it's easier said than done. the last 3 months have been horrible and the waiting was the worst. But I DO NOT have cancer! The women and men on this site are AMAZING..but you have to remember that if they are still on the site...they probably had a cancer diagnosis. So you are not exposed to the great number of people whose tests are benign. I check in now and then because I'm trying to figure out this Tamoxifen thing to to check up on friends I have met here. take it one step at a time... and keep us posted!",
