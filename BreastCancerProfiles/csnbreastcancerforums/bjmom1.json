So what I do is give it to him no matter what you going throught remember the battle is not your it the Lord. He only one who can help you get through. Live life think of positive things and let the negative thought go. We all are fearful, but we have to be happy that we was able to wake up and see another day so enjoy that day. I know it hard not to think negative but don't stay there give that negative thought to Lord. And show him you are happy he gave you another day by doing something positive and believe that he will help you fight this battle. Remember whatever you do to help fight this disease God is with you ever step of the way. God Bless you Huggs from your BC sister Barbara",
