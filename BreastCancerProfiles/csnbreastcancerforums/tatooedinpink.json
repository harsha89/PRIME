      "Content": "Well, I feel pretty silly commenting on this when I got up at 7am for no good reason on a Sat morning, and am still up at 2:15am the following morning. My excuse is that I drank a lot of iced tea tonight and ate some chocolate cake at 11pm! ANYWAY, I took Ambien after my mom's death and continued it thru my treatment, so I took it for about 3 years. I decided I wasn't going to keep taking drugs of any kind to sleep, so I gradually weaned myself off of it. Sometimes, I still don't sleep well, BUT, I do find that if I walk a couple of miles in the evening, I ALWAYS sleep very well. Regular exercise is probably the best thing you can do. Hope you find something that helps. You need your rest!",

We have got to SLOW down and quit living on fast food and processed junk, and take time to feed our families properly, get more exercise, get more rest and enjoy life. I am trying so hard to change bad habits, but it is a struggle. I want my 14 year old son to live a long healthy life. And it's my job to see that he does...",

      "Content": "Just had to share.... I went to a baby shower at my oncologist's partner's house yesterday. Just a coincidence his wife is related to my friend...ALSO, onc is married to another onc, so..... They had this huge mansion of a house on a lake here. Their landscaping was so beautiful and I kept thinking the whole time, I could fill up a bag with cuttings from their plants and they would never even miss them. I have already spent about $300 on new plants the last couple of months, and still needs some yard improvement, so gosh, I was thinking about what else I could have spent that money on and got plants for free! I think I am getting more like my mom....she would have just done it and giggled all the way home! Well, at least I found out where some of my money goes, since he is in the same practice with my onc :-) Maybe they'll let me come over again, since I didn't steal anything :-) Debbie",

      "Content": "Jackie, I too, have a self-centered sister, who came to see me the first weekend I was diagnosed, only to see if I would allow her to make all my decisions for me. Once she saw I was going to listen to my doctors FIRST and make my own decisions thru my own research and thru many helpful volunteers at our Breast Cancer Resource Center, she didn't have much else to do with me. Never saw her again thru my treatment and she lives an hour and a half away. All I ever heard during that time, was that she was now definitely going to get it, since me and my mom both had it. She has always been so self centered, it didn't surprise me. SO, I surrounded myself with my good friends and family that WERE concerned about me. I have 3 brothers and one sister, and have always been the responsible one that everyone goes to, and that they can all depend on. It gets old. Try to focus on your health right now and give the family a break. As the comedian, Ron White, says \"You can't fix stupid\" :-) Big Hug to you, Debbie",
