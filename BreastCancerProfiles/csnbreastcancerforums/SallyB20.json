    "Content": "I have only just been on letrozole a month now but the arthritic symptoms in my hands is the worst so far.  Had to remove my rings for fear they would need to be cut off and i wake up with numb hands all night long.  Other joints are achy too and I fear they will only get worse.  Has anyone heard that femara brand name is better than generic for side effects?  I had read somewhere that Letrozol had more side effects and was thinking of asking my oncologist to prescribe it.  the idea of five or ten years or more of this is unbearable.  I hope someone out there can offer me some help.   Thanks.",
