      "Content": "Thanks for giving me hope! I signed up for this board three weeks ago and for some reason I was scared to log on after I signed up. The tumor found in my breast was stage 1 grade III. I don't have to have chemo but I was just contacted to start radiation treatments. I was so happy to see your note first. God bless all of you. Hope is really a wonderful thing!!!",
