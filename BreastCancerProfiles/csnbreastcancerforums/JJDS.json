      "Content": "The survival rate and recurrence rate is the same with a mastectomy as with a lumpectomy and radiation.  They can never get all of your breast tissue with a mastectomy, so, you will always have breast tissue left.  You also have to have surgery to get new implants, I think, every 10 years or so.  You need to be sure of your choice, irregardless of what your surgeon recommends, either a mastectomy or a lumpectomy with radiation.  I've always been so thankful that I could have a lumpectomy.  Good luck to you!",
