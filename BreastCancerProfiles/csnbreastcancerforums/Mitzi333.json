Oddly enough it's thicker and curlier. Once you've gone through the hair loss and thinning, we realize how important hair really is. I'm praying for you!!! And... good move to go to the dermatologist to determine what's going on. Sending positive vibes your way!!! {{{hugs}}} Mitzi",

I took my time working with the lashes and got it right... some days better than others. I used a tooth pick to help line them up and a Very thin layer of glue. I used a #3 and #4 Kiss lashes... inexpensive and natural looking. I started by laying them across the lash line, folding them (to round them out) a few times, and then applied a thin layer of glue. Also make sure you allow yourself enough time to work with them, because at first it can be frustrating. Now I no longer wear them, I'm allowing them to grow back. I'm also trying out latisse. It appears to be working... Good luck with the lashes... you'll enjoy them once you get the hang of working with them... just allow yourself enough time to experiment. {{{Hugs}}} Mitzi",

I cut my hair short and plan to cut the top down even shorter tomorrow. Just to follow up on your comment... is that ichy and tingling feeling a sign that hair loss is within days of occurring? I'm phisically prepared and ready with my wigs, but want to be a bit more emotionally prepared in knowing that ichy feeling IS the signal that balding is right around the cornor. Please elaborate more on how your hair loss occurred after that feeling. Thanks Bunches for all of your advice. I REALLY Appreciate all of the support this site provides.",
