      "Content": "After a courageous 17 year battle with bc my baby sister passed away today. She was a true warrior. I'll always remember her warm beautiful smile. I'm sure she was greeted by all the angels and has already made friends with most of them. I grieve for her husband and children who were her wonderful caregivers these last few months. I am glad she is in a better place - no more chemo - scans - or pain. Rest in peace Kathy. I'll miss you. Skipper",
