But, I do want you to know that I am here to support you in your treatment. I do know what you mean about going through the motions, and feeling like it's a dream world...it's like it's not really happening to you. Try to keep a positive attitude, because all treatments go so much better if you do.Each treatment you have is one more step to being done. I wish you all the best. Cyndi",

      "Content": "Hi Laverne....as for the breast redness...did your radiation oncologist give you any Aquaphor ointment? If not, go to Wal-Mart or Walgreens and buy some. It comes in a tube. It is very greasy, like vaseline. But, every night, I slathered it on really thick, and used an older nightshirt I didn't mind getting stained. It really helps in the external healing process. Do you have a family? If so, it is time for them to take over the house. When you get home from work, you need to sleep. The flu-like symptoms sound like what I had during radiation, and it was just from being totally exhausted. Ask your medical oncologist if a mild anti-depressant would help at all. I don't know if it would, but sometimes, those drugs, although you still feel tired for the first week or so, really tend to pick you up after that. It helps in the long run with the anxiety, because if you are able to be awake and function better, you in turn just feel better, and less anxious. As for the physical pain, that seems to be different with every woman I've met. I still get what I think is bone pain in the areas that were radiated....the breast bone and the rib areas. Sometimes it feels like someone hit me with a baseball bat. I have found that taking Naproxen (generic for Aleve..over-the-counter) regularly for a few days alleviates that pain. I certainly wish you all the best. Do NOT give up on yourself...don't give in to this rotten disease....you have it beat, and it will NOT beat you. We are all here as a group to help, and it may even do you some good to search for a local support group through your hospital or oncologist, or if you have one, a local cancer center, and also the American Cancer Society. In fact, I think you can search for one that they sponsor right here on their website. Please write to me any time...I'm at the other end of the e-mail! Cyndi millionairs2@aol.com",

I have a feeling when you've had cancer, they don't want to make you wait long for the results. I was told after the fact that if there is a radiologist there that day, that you can request it be read while you wait. I don't know if that works everywhere or not, but it's worth asking. I will pray for you to have a clean mammo. Try to focus on the fact you have done everything humanly possible to make sure the cancer is gone. Please let us know how it comes out.

I told her if they ever wanted to biopsy me, they would have to put me out or I would just live with the fact I might have the cancer. She said if I pressed the issue, it could be done outpatient. Not sure if this is an option for you, but it's worth a thought. I think worrying about the procedure is sometimes worse than waiting for the diagnosis. Hang in there...if I could be there to hold your hand, I would. God bless, Cyndi",

And just think, for all the new ladies that do find this site, there are so many more who are diagnosed that we don't even know about. My first rude awakening was the Susan G. Komen Race For The Cure. I have never seen so many pink shirts and hats! I cannot believe the physician's asst. said that to you. That is an awful thing to say. If they don't know exactly what causes our cancer, how can they know if it will come back? I would have smacked the person!!! You just keep your spirits up, live every day to the fullest with a positive attitude, and you'll do just fine. I nwill pray that recurrence will not be in your vocabulary. While we all have that thought in the back of our minds, it's not fair for someone to come out and say it will be back, when no one knows. Stick with us and you'll get all the support you need!

I remember the fatigue with my radiation, and how people just thought I could clean house, shop, and still have time to play since I don't work. God forbid that they have to get the disease to understand it! I wouldn't wish that on anyone, but it really would be nice sometimes for them to be able to see you when you're down. I, too, have a wonderful husband who was a rock for me through it all, even though I know he was crashing inside...it was tough on him, too, I know, but I thank God for him every day. I hope all goes well with the chemo coming up. You just worry about taking care of you right now. And, while you're at it, make up a chart for the co-workers so they know when their day to help you is! LOL!!! Some day, you will be all done with this, so they'll have you back soon enough. Just don't worry about them, and do what you have to do for you!!! God bless....Cyndi",

As for the radiation, I can tell you I had 33 treatments, and I am no worse for wear. I got pretty pink, but the skin only felt like a very mild sunburn. The breast tissue, and under my arm hurt like I was PMS-ing after about the first week, and stayed that way for awhile afterwards. It does toughen the skin, but the breast is still very pliable, and (according to my husband) doesn't feel much different than the other one. It will also feel hot through the treatments, but not unbearable. Of course, everyone is different, so your reactions could be different, but I have friends locally who felt pretty much like I did, that it wasn't all that bad. I personally felt the worse part was the driving to the cancer center every day....after the simulation and the first treatment (which take longer due to the set-up involved), you will spend more time on the road than you will getting the treatment.
