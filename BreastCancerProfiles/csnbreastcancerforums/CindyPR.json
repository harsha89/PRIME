We are from Calif. but with military here in PR. If I can be of any help, with support let me know. I know what you are going through. Go through that last bone scan, please be positive, as I have been there, as crying will not do any good, as living in PR you have the different culture, and have to be positive. Hubby, is the best, listen to him. as said the doc's know. Cindy",
