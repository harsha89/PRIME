    "Content": "I just scheduled my first chemo appointment today for January 5. I am scared to death. I'll be taking Taxotere and Cytoxan. Can anyone share their experience with this cocktail? I understand it is different for everyone, but I have heard that this is one of the more tolerable combos. Also, any tips on preparing for that dreaded day? Thanks, Kathy",
