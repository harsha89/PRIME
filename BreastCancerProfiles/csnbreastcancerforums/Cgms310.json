    "Content": "I have a sad story to share with you from my family in England, but my concern is if the same practice may exist here in the US. My sister in law had both breast removed some 10 years ago and was give the \"all clear\" until about 9 months ago, when her symptoms returned. Despite trips to Germany for supposed \"wonder treatments\" her health continued to fail and she returned home with my brother who despite his age, cared for her each day. Towards the end of May, 2012 my sister in law took a turn for the worse and was admitted to a local hospice only for the purposes of rest and additional care, that my brother simply could. After three days she was to return home. He stayed at her side for the first two days, but had to go home briefly to get clothes etc, leaving his daughter to sit with her mother. Within a hour of his departure, a team of three physicians entered and told the daughter that they were going to administer a stent for the purposes of feeding. Despite specific instructions not to do so, by both my sister in law and her husband, it was placed into her arm. Within 36 hours her condition worsened to the point of her writhing in pain, only to have additional morphine administered. When my brother returned to the room, he asked that the stent be removed immediately, but they refused, telling him it was for the better good of her health, needless to say, she was failing rapidly and she passed away on June 1st. It was later discovered that she had be placed into a program called Liverpool Care Pathway (Google it!) This procedure is used when a team of doctors \"decide\" that the patient in their opinion was not going to recover and simple cut off food and fluids. They continue to give pain medication until they die. My brother is now seeking legal counsel as the what if anything he can do, but to be honest, the system in England is ancient and like Canada, is a disastrous failure of socialized medicine. If you know of others who were killed in this way, or of similar incidents here in the US please let me know. Thatnk you, Charles.",
