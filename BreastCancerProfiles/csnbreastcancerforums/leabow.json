      "Content": "First I want to say how many beautiful young courageous women are on here. I probably should not even be on here because I am older and have lived to see my grandchildren. But here goes and hope my story will help. I found a 4mm nodule in left breast two years ago and took it to my doctor and to radiology. They did all the special tests and diagnosed me with a blocked duct and no cancer. Of course that is what you want to hear. A year later I went back for my annual visit with the radiologist and he agreed no cancer. My intuition keep telling me they were wrong. So I insisted that I see a surgeon. It was cancer and it had become early stage imvasive breast cancer. I am lucky it is low grade, no HER2/neu, and no lymph node involvement. It is fueled by hormones. Now I am waiting on the Oncotype Dx to see the percentage of recurrance to see if chem would be beneficial. The whole point of me sharing this: If a little voice inside is telling you something is not right or you feel that you should have more done, insist that the lump is removed. A woman's intuition is usually right.",

      "Content": "I have had my second year of reclast with very little side effects. I had more side effects the first year I had it but only shortly after the infusion. I could not take the pill because it made my acid reflux much worse. My side effects from femara are much worse than side effects from reclast. My oncologist got my insurance to pay for it by filing it as a part of my treatment. Good luck on wharever you decide to do.",
