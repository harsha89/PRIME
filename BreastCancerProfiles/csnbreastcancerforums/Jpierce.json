    "Content": "Dear Hacktown, I agree with the others about getting a second opinion. You should feel comfortable with your team and the approach they recommend. I was diagnosed with stage IIB triple negative, IDC. My doctors recommended chemo and radiation after my lumpectomy. While chemo was difficult at the time, it has been three months since my last treatment and I'm feeling more and more \"normal\" every day. I was told that since my cancer was aggressive that it would respond well to chemo since chemo attacks fast growing cells (a silver lining?).  If if you are like my husband, reading up on everything he possibly could, be careful about going down the Internet rabbit hole. You will have many people offering advice and telling you horror stories. Seek out knowledgable sources and act on what makes sense to you.  I wish you both the very best. Julia",
