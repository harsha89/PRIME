      "Content": "I am new here and have posted a couple times. I have a question, what is the \"pink bus\". I think its a bus that I never dreamed I'd be needing, but.....I have \"secretory carcinoma\". It is a rare breast cancer and have found very little info on it so welcome all you have. I will have a double mastectomy on March 21st. I am one year post treatment for Anal Cancer and doing well since that treatment of chemo/rad. My test in Feb. showed NED at this time, and thats when they diaganosed the BC. Life is funny,huh???? So happy to have this place...please let me know more about the bus???",

      "Content": "As has been said, there are no real rights or wrongs on who and when to tell. This is your thing and you need to do what feels right to you. I have 5 children between 19 and 26. I was first diagnosed about 1.5yrs ago with Anal cancer (and thats a hard one to discuss with people who don't have), and then last month with Secretory Carcinoma...a very rare Breast Cancer. I never made specific plans for talks with family, just kind of knew when the time was right. I did find my kids (oldest a boy, the rest girls) to be much more relaxed about hearing the info than I thought. We have had a few unexpected emotional breakdowns over the year that when I think about it are due to botteled up worry and concern, those kids need hugs and reassurance as much as we do through this....but you will all come out with a renewed strength and closness that is an unbelievable blessing. It is always easier to answer questions as you have more info and feel more confident yourself. This site is full of people with great advice and support so seek help as needed. You and your family will be in my thoughts and prayers as you continue on this adventure.",

      "Content": "Sometimes I feel so ignorant. Someone asked me to explain what is meant when after many treatments it the term 5yr survivor is used. Obviosly it speaks for itself, but what happens after that. Does it mean that (said drug) has a certain survival percentage of people who live 5yrs and than usually die shortly after or do most studies just not continue long after that, or is it just a fact that too many cancer patients of all sorts just don't survive more than that....because that doesn't seem true. I'll have to come back with an actual quote to better ask this maybe, any thoughts??",

      "Content": "Last year at this time I was in a nursing home recovering from Stage 3 Anal cancer. I came home in the summer and in December my husband had a bone marrow transplant. He is recovering and in Feb. I was diagnosed with breast cancer...double mastectomy in March!!! Son-in-law (like my own son), just home from second tour in Afganistan. Daughter (single mom) also military is now away at training. It has been and continues to be one **** of a year!! But...I have the absolute BEST kids I could have ever hoped for, (and 6 grandsons...all under 4yrs). On Mothers Day, I plan to first skype my daughter away at training so she can see her little guy (he is bopping back and forth with family), my Church has a great Moms Day service so will be there with some of my 5 kids, hope to fit in a visit to the cemetary where my mom is and will surely have her on my mind all day, in the afternoon my son-in-law, a grill-master in my mind, is cooking for whatever family can make it. Mostly though, I plan to just sit back and thank God for what I have and how he has carried me through this past couple years. I am so proud of my family and how they have pulled together to help myself, husband, and each other through the more difficult times. I never was a \"perfect\" mother, who is, and as my children become parents I see them making mistakes also....being a grandma lets me make corrections in a more gentle sort of way. No family is without fault and that is what makes us all so unique....I for one, love mine just as they are! Happy Mom's Day to all.",

      "Content": "Hi I am sorry for the situation you find yourself in. A little over 3 yrs ago I was diagnosed with Secretory Carcinoma of the breast (a rare bc accounting for <1% of all breast cancers). Treatment was a mastectomy and I chose to have a double. For me reconstruction was not an option as this came just a year after being treated for Stage 3b anal cancer and I was healing from chemo/rad as well as had ostomy surgery. I can't say for sure what I would have done regarding reconstruction had my situation been different, but have been completely comfortable with out. These decisions are so personal and each individual has to make their own. Whats best for one is not necessarily what feels right for another. I will tell you that I have a smaller build and like the feeling of symmetry in having had a double mastectomy. There have been a few times (mostly only involving dresses) that fitting is a problem, as many have darts and are cut to fit breasts! I occasionally wear a lightly padded sports type bra just to add some shape and easier fit, but also go without. (Much cooler and more comfortable in warm weather) Scarfs are another great way to feel balanced as well. Since I deal with long term issues related to my initial anal cancer and was recently treated for a recurrance in my lung, I am thankful to have a little less worry of recurrance of the breast cancer. While there are never any guarantees in these matters I have no regrets in having had the mastectomies. I will keep you in my thoughts and prayers that you come to a decision that feels right for you and wishing you health and peace as you move forward. katheryn",

      "Content": "Hi, and welcome. I was pescribed Arimidex a little over 2yrs ago after a double mastectomy for a rare breast cancer (secretory carcinoma). This came just 1yr after finishing treatment for Stage3b anal cancer. I too looked at the bottle every day for several weeks and googled all the scary side effects, then finally just took a breathe and dove in!! I initially had some areas of osteopenia but a recent scan showed no worsening as of yet and I've been taking that little pill faithfully for two years now. I also take Calcium with Vit D and Alondronate to help the calcium bind to bones. I eat lots of dark green veges, and try to stay active daily. Light weight bearing exercises like walking, jumping, and lifting grand-babies helps build bone strength. My aches and pains are no worse than they were before and in fact may be less, (though I feel worse if I don't at least do some stretching). I take the pill in the evening as was suggested by someone here. If I have any complaint, it may be that I have gotten a little softer around the middle and lost some of my old lady abs lol. (I have gained about 10lbs) This may or may not be related as I have also had surgery due to the anal cancer (colostmy) along with a long time love of ice cream. Good luck.....I will keep you in my thoughts as you move forward in healing and health! Â ",
