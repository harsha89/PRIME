      "Content": "Saw the internist yesterday. I asked for the last appointment of the day. He spent a good 45 minutes with me. Discussed nerve block for the chronic pain I am having from lymph node removal (May 2010). The pain guy wanted to do a nerve block, but I chickened out. Internist switched me from 1200 mg Gabapentin to Lyrica to try and see how I react to this. Got ulcer pain from the Gabapentin. He gave me samples and started me with 125 mg, but I don't think this will do the trick. I can go as high as 300 mg. Has anyone had Lyrica? Am I going to blow up to the size of a house? He also gave me Voltaren, an NSAID creme, to apply under the armpit and down the trunk 2-3 times/day. If all of this doesn't work, we'll talk nerve block again. He still holds out hope pain will diminish, well, I hope so too. Cinnamonsmile - how are you doing, dear? Hugs, Marlene",

Last Herceptin was Nov. 2010,(3 weeks interval) and the doctor regularly during that time. Had a PET scan late Feb. 2011 as well as a mammogram and blood test - negative, Thank God. Note on the mammogram said - reschedule in 1 year. However, oncologist scheduled another PET scan and blood test beginning of this month and I saw him at that time. Next appointment in 3 months, and if all is well, another series of tests by the end of this year/beginning of next year. M.",

      "Content": "Stormie, my dear - please talk to your doctor about your thoughts, if you haven't done so already. By all means go with your Mother to her appointment and ask questions. It's always a good thing to have another person along, another ear. My oncologist refuses to answer any questions related to prognosis or chances of recurrence. Your Mother still has radiation to get at what some call \"the beast\". I myself am 15 months out from the end of radiation, preceded by 6 months chemo, a lumpectomy and 1 year out from the end of Herceptin. I am sure there are other ladies out there with similar experiences to your Mother. Lots of Hugs to you, Marlene",

      "Content": "I had a lumpectomy (2 tumors in the left breast). Since the cancer had unfortunately spread into the lymph nodes, 18 were removed and I had to have chemo as well as radiation. Had no advice whatsoever on what to wear while I had the drain in (almost 6 weeks). Fortunately I had one house gown with a zipper down the front, also wore some of husband's old oversized cotton T-shirts. For the shower I put one of my metal chain belts around my waist and fastened the drain on to it. Also I had a shower stool in the bathtub and husband fastened a grip onto the tub for me to grab. It made it easier and safer to step into the tub. Good luck, my dear. Marlene",

      "Content": "Cinnamonsmile: You are one tough cookie, just to read about your experience makes me feel faint! Hope you get enough relief to last through the month until your doctor comes back. How about some chicken soup? I am still doped up on Lyrica, need a higher dosage to stop the pain, but can't tolerate it. Yesterday I burned myself on the iron, instead of grabbing the handle I grabbed the iron instead, I put that down to being loopy from Lyrica. Put fresh aloe vera on the burn, I grow a pot in the backyard, it doesn't look too bad. I found a masseuse willing to handle me, there is a lot of scar tissue, she also noticed the sweling which the doctor described as \"phantom swelling\" - duh! I knew it was there! The massage felt so good I went to town during yoga class, result -I hurt bad ever since. I am wondering if the massage was a good idea or not? I am so fed up with it all! Many, very careful hugs, Marlene PS - A hug to your partner as well",

      "Content": "CS: I am up against the proverbial wall. Having a Medicare HMO severly limits the doctors available to me, if I change I may fall from the frying pan into the fire. It would mean not having access to my very excellent oncologist, I would have to change the group, and he is only in the one I am in now. One of the reason the internist does not recommend PT (he did once before, when I had a frozen shoulder), the movement of my arm is practically normal and his hands are tied to some extend by the HMO. Houston is supposed to be on the forefront of medical facilities, but, no, the doctors are NOT familiar with Post pain syndrome (mine is from the lymph node removal). You should see the surprise on their collective faces when I describe my pain, especially on the pain guy's. The only \"good\" thing is - none of them have patted me on the head yet \"there, there, little lady, take a tranquilizer\", they DO take me seriously. I am putting my hope into the masseuse that she knows what she is doing, I have 4 more sessions with her and that Lyrica will calm the nerves. I got a lidocaine gel to apply under arm and also Voltaren gel (NSAID), use both 3x/day. So, round and round and round I go. M. PS - You were the only one who replied to my question about post pain syndrome, have you seen any other posts referring to the pain you and I suffer from?",

      "Content": "DEar CS: Thanks for your detailed description. The massage therapist is quite experienced and immediately honed in on the scar tissue. Although I have pain down the trunk and towards the back she says there is no scar tissue in that area, it's under the arm, under the breast and on top of the breast towards the center of the chest. I am attending a chair yoga class, we do a lot of the regular yoga moves, but modified. Can't get up and down on the mat anymore, partially due to age, and in part due to good old Gabapentin/Lyrica dizziness. Haven't seen a PT, doctor will not prescribe it, I chose to pay for the massage therapist instead. The Athletic Club's instructors are well trained and the Senior classes ideal, I think, for the type condition that you and I suffer. We stretch, use weights, etc., but toned way down. Measurements around my arm are now the same both sides, I am watching it carefully. I was told the same thing, i.e. that the pain from exercise, PT, etc. is necessary and will eventually (we hope) result in less pain. I am not opposed to the pain clinic, but just plain old scared! Lord, girl, what you have gone through! It is an option I am keeping in mind. My game plan is to finish my current Lyrica, which will be around the end of October, and then see the Internist again with the question - where do we go from here? My doctors look everywhere but at me when I asked - why the pain and what are you going to do about it? Well, eerrrr, mumble, mumble, it MAY get better. (16 months and counting) Not going to iron any time soon! Take care, Marlene",

      "Content": "Dear CS: Don't have as good a motion on the left as I have on the right, some of this is due to having had a frozen shoulder. Started some exercise right after surgery and in my case, it helped. The scar tissue under arm is in a roll of \"spongy\" tissue, under the breast and on top of the breast. She emphasized that she can help with the scar tissue pain, but NOT the nerve pain. Oncologist suggested OTC Lidocaine gel, husband got a bottle at Kroger it's called \"Aloe Vera Pain Relieving Gel with Lidocaine & Menthol\". He cautioned me not to use too much of it. It helps a little, deadens pain for a short while. Voltaren creme is prescription, again, it helps a little temporarily. Put Voltaren on first and then the gel - it's messy, usually I run around the house without a stitch of clothes on that side until it dries, husband keeps saying, why are you partially naked? Duh! As far as the medical team is concerned, I am sure you agree the most important person is the Oncologist, who is excellent. The internist is well known, my nursie friends recommend him highly and he has been very good to me in the past. That's why I was taken aback with comments like \"phantom swelling\". I haven't come across a single person at the Hospital's support group with the kind of pain you and I have, every other kind of side effect and problem you can imagine, but not that! The nurse coordinator of the Breast Center had heard about it, but that's all! Let's hope that somewhere down the line the pain lessens, the doctors keep dangling this hope in front of my nose, except the Oncologist who says - it will get better, but may never go away altogether. Many hugs, dear CS - Marlene",
