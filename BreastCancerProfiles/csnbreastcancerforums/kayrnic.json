    "Content": "So, I'm a 10 year bc survivor. Stage IIA, negative nodes, er/pr+, her2-, received lumpectomy, node dissection, 4 rounds AC, and radiation in 2001/2002. I was 29 years old. Now I'm 39 and have been diagnosed a second time with what appears to be a stage I tumor in the same breast. I decided to have a double mas. with immediate reconstruction so the plastic surgeon ordered a ct scan to check to make sure everything looked good from a vascular standpoint. Well, surprise.....two lesions in my liver and one on my spine. Probably mets from the cancer 10 years ago. This really sucks....I thought I had beat it. They're doing an ultrsound monday to get a better look at the liver. What comes after that? What type of treatment can I expect? I'm hoping to live 4 more years to see my son graduate high school. Is this realistic? Any help, support, personal stories? Thanks!",
