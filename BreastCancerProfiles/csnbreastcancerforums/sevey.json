I cannot get into the web/chat you created, and I really wanted to, however my nephew was on the computer and I could'nt and would'nt tell him more than once to get off. When he finally did I could not get on soon enough, and this medication makes it hard got me at times. I will try 2morrow and make it happen! Gods Love & Peace Love Cathy",

I do know that my brain scan as fine. I thank God for that, because I worried it may have spread to my brain. Won't have much to say untill I can talk to this Dr and see what He thinks or discovers. As far as I am concerned Jesus is in my corner and the Ultimate Physision..... He won't let me down and I will never give up a minute before the miracle... It is good to be out of the hospital. I am so tired and sleepy that I am napping all the time. You never get any rest in those places! Anyway I just wanted to check in with you all and let you know I am still ticking. Gods Grace &love Love Cathy",

I had a double myself, and opted not to listen after all the previous meds and treatments. So I think it is safe to say that he knows what he is doing. Just a thought. I will continue to pray for you and I know you will do the right thing. God Bless You Cathy",

      "Content": "Dear Sisters & Friends, As many have noticed I have'nt been around much as I have had 2 surgies. One was to encase a very large tumer & the other last week. The large one was shrinking because of Laetrille, but to be safe the Sr & Dr decided to encase it. They will be blasting that thing out of me early Sept. It is great, because it was stage 4 organ cancer & about to enter my pancres. The one I had removed last wk was very tiny compared to all the other surgeries. The pathology were very surprized that it had not been bigger as it is the same type of tumor that is encased. I give Glory to God for all of this & laetrille {which is a substance that grows naturally. The seeds of apricots. I also take coral calcium & a few enzymes that cancer robs our bodies. I am so Blessed & my wish is for others to not have to go through such radical treaments like chemo & radiation. Both meds that I take I order right off the computer. What is cool about Laetrille is even if you don't have cabcer it is good for you as it removes toxins from your system. When I finished having this other removed{the big one}.... I will continue to take Laetrille for the rest of my life. I am pleased with the results as opposed to the chemo which almost killed me before the cancer would have last winter. Please don't misunderstand my words the chemo used to work on me on many occassions & saved my life. However my system cannot tolerate it again so what do people in my shoes do? Find something that works & take it; especially when it is working!!!!!! Yet I refuse not to acknoledge that God wants me around to offer support to those that have this inciduous disease. I feel I got a lot of work to do now & a lot of reading to catch up with you guys. Just give me a little time to catch up on the pages underneath this top one. Too sore to sit at the computer for too long....so it may take a while. I just wanted to share some good news & say that I truelly am praying for so many of you. I am also very happy to see Hummingbyrd back online too!... With this new computer I can join tha YAYA sister chat. I forgot the time so Hummer you will have to remind me. Well these meds are making me feel yucky again. God Bless You All Love Cathy",
