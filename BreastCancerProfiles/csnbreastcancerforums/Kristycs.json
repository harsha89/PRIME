      "Content": "I was diagnosed with BC Pr+hr+ in December of '10. I had a lumpectomy in March of '11. Clean margins, no lymph nodes. Stage 1 to early 2. My Onco Score was 7. I was excited. I opted out of radiation because we were moving to another state. I was supposed to take Tamoxifen but couldn't get past the 15 side effects. So, I decided to go on the Budwig Protocol. I just had a CT and X-Rays and all is clear! Almost 18 months out.... Treatment is such a personal decision. I lost my mom at 61 in 1999 and my dad at 72 in 2008. My brother is in a tough battle and has been for 7 years, he is 54. I was diagnosed at 44.... I am determined to try The Budwig Protocol along with Iodine, Vitamin D3 and IP6 indefinitely... We will see how it goes but I am a firm believer in God and Christs finished work on the cross.... I stand in his word which says \"by Jesus stripes, you are healed\". You are his beloved. He paid for all of your sickness and pain on the cross! I will pray for your healing!..... Thank you Jesus, Thank you!",
