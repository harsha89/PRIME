    "Content": "I am 38 and diagnosed 10/03. My husband of 18 years took this very hard also. I have checked with the ACS for support groups, they are available for the entire family. But my husband is like most men, he won't go unless it is for me. So I asked friends of ours, who were all rallying around me to be there for him. It worked, they take him to the races, and golfing, things like that. So he gets away. Just remember for both of you that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. And this can bring you even closer.",
