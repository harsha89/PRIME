      "Content": "I had a lumpectomy and radiotherapy of the right breast 14 years ago, 18 months ago I had a swellling in the armpit of the opposite breast, tests showed that I had cancer again in the original breast. I had a mastectomy and lymph glands removed. The glands were positive so I then had chemo. The problem is I still have a swollen left armpit and get pain in my arm and left breast which increases the more I use the arm. My doctors don't have any ideas as to the problem. Has anyone else come across this problem?",

      "Content": "It is possible to have gene testing in the UK. As my sister and I are both breast cancer patients my daughter, son and nephew wish to know if we have the gene. As far as I know some tissue from our tumours will be tested, (all tumours are kept for so long after they have been removed). It can take a long time for the results to come through. Your GP should be able to arrange it for you. You have to fill in a questionnaire with details of your family cancer history and I think the hospital then decide whether it is worth progressing. I will keep you posted on anything else that happens. Caroll",
