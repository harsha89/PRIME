      "Content": "I have had some mild soreness at the mastectomy area. My radiation doctor sent me to a physical therapist. Some massage and stretching exercises. There is scar tissue, of course, that develops and builds up at the area of surgery. Some gentle massage helps to break that up. Ask you radiation doc for a referral to a physical therapist who has experience treating bc patients and understands the affects of radiaton.",

      "Content": "I have 9 more radiation treatments left out of 33. This week I have been laughing with the technicans because I am bumpy and itchy ... The radiation fries some of the hair folices and that makes the bump and itch too, I think. The burn didn't start for me for at least the first couple weeks. I have been hydrating my skin with 100% Aloe Vera frequently. I smother my skin with Aloe Vera 3 hours before the treatment. While I am in the changing room, I put on more Aloe Vera and Biafine cream the nurses gave me. I find the Biafine more soothing than the Aquaphor. My doctor offered to prescribe a steroid cream for the itching, but I'm sticking with the Aloe Vera. Now that I am at the end of treatment I find the fatigue is hitting. My energy is low. The best news ... This too shall pass! Keep your skin hydrated, drink lots of water. I believe the Aloe Vera has helped me tolerate the treatments. The Aloe Vera I am using is 100% pure aloe. Look for it in health food stores. I know there is an aloe vera cream some women have purchased at Walgreens. Good luck and remember it will soon be over.",
