I cannot do anything to make it easier, but I can pray for the journey to be as easy as possible. God bless you both. Jenn",

      "Content": "I'm a geek, and a fiddler, which means everyone has their own personal ringtone in my phone. Hubby, who is 44 and the love of my life, always said Toby Keith's \"As Good As I Once Was\" was how he felt. (Not so much the drinking and partying, because he was never really like that. But he used to be able to work literally days on end without sleep or rest and now just can't do that anymore. LOL) So a bit of that song is his. My father-in-law is a massive fan of westerns, so I have the theme from the Lone Ranger for him. My pastor's wife has \"It's Shoutin' Time in Heaven.\" Basically, I love to customize ringtones to each person. I do have a general ring tone, but I tend to change that every few months because I get bored easily. It's actually been set to the \"Stars and Stripes Forever\" for a while now. I usually switch to Christmas songs around the holidays. I'm not sure if this all means I'm artistic or just scatterbrained. I get bored easily. Lord help me when I'm stuck in the chemo center for hours on end! Thank heavens I have an iPad! LOL",

Have to change bed linens practically every night. â˜¹ Anyway, I'm very glad that you & your mom got through today okay. And it's so good that both your father & hubby were there for support! Here's hoping you continue to feel better & that the Taxotere is an easier regimen than the A/C. Love & prayers, Jenn",

      "Content": "So sorry you're not feeling well. From the start picking up some kind of cold or flu has been one of my fears because I just want to get through the chemo ASAP. I hate the thought of having to delay treatment due to illness, as I'm sure you do. Sounds like were on a similar plan. I've just had my 3rd A/C with one more to come, then it's on to Taxotere plus Herceptin. I sure hope everything works out for you & that you're able to keep your treatments on schedule. Please let us know how it goes for you & your mom. God bless you both, & know you are in my (& everyone else's I'm sure) thoughts & prayers! Love, Jenn",
