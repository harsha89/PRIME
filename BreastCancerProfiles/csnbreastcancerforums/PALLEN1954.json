    "Content": "i just found this site and I am so glad I did! I have been on Femara for about 8 months now - and yes my legs especially ache all the time - a flue like ache - and in the mornings when i get up my feet are really sore and stiff! Even after sitting for a while. Takes a while to get moving on them! I am glad to read these blogs and find out this is possibly a side effect of Femara!!",
