My hubby told me he would shave his his to match me if I wanted him to ,I told him he didn't have to, but I thought how sweet of him and told him so. At about this time last year I was still wearing my ball cap.Glad to hear that you have such a positive attitude. Keep us posted. God Bless Debbie",

I only got sick on the first treatment then they tried different meds. and it worked for me . I was just completely exhausted and I kept getting dehydrated so I had to have ivs all the time. Try and drink lots of water the more the better.My first 4 treatments I could not get water down so they told me any fluids the last 4 were the Taxol and I drank water all the time.Remember my prayers are with you and keep us posted.

Also drink lots of water or some type of fluid that always seemed to help me I kept getting dehydrated and would have to go in for IV. Just rest when your body tells you chemo isn't a picnic but it sure is worth it in the end. God Bless Debbie",
