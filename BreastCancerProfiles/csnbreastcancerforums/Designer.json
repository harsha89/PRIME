    "Content": "I looked up gummie bear recipe on the net. Wow this would be an easy way to get the package a day jello. It called for one \"sugar free\" flavored jello and 6 plain geletin mixed with 1/2 cup cold water. This glob is then heated and poured into molds to be put in the freezer for 10 minutes. I thought this was a great idea for a 7 day stash of jello. The jello helps me more then the pain relievers. At least it takes some of the edge off so I can sleep better. I also started leaving some dishes to wash in the morning so I could warm up my hands in the hot water.",
