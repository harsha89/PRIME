      "Content": "First of all, there are no silly questions when it comes to cancer. A question is a question that's all. They told me same day that mine was very suspicious and scheduled me for biopsy. I think they knew, but the radiologist was a very kind and consideration woman and I think she was trying to let me have time to talk and settle a little because I was projecting a not me sort of attitude. I had had two negative lumps removed in my 20s and thought this was just another one (my cancer was found 18 months ago and I was 56). When they were doing the bx. she said she was pretty sure it was cancer, but would call me when she got the results. She called two days later and told me the biopsy results were positive. Did they do an ultrasound? Or just the mammogram? Please calmly and persistently ask for results. And keeep asking until you get them.",
