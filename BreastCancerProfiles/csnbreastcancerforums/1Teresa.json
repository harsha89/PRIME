      "Content": "had her eyebrows tatood before she was dx. When she was considering chemo she was hessitant because she didnt want to lose her hair. Finally my brothers and I got her to agree to do it. She lost her hair, but still had these beautiful eyebrows. Her hair did grow back in about 3 mos, and beautifully. Unfortunately the dr was wrong and mom ended up getting mets to the bones and the bc wasnt gone. Since that time last year she has been in and out of the hospital a few times, spent 118 days in ICU, had part of her colon removed, dehydration, too low white blood cells, too high white blood cells, too low red blood cells, pnemonia 3x, VRE, etc. and now she has tumors \"all over her back\", her pelvis, hips and a few broken ribs. I believe that given the option of doing chemo, even at the expense of her hair, she would gladly do it and wear a wig for a few months.",

      "Content": "but my mom is still alive. She is in 24/7 pain but I am trying to keep her doped up so she doesnt feel it as bad. The dr has pretty much given up on her though. I \"think\" she will still be here for Christmas (but I wouldnt bet my daughter's life on it) and as to if she will be here Jan 31st (my daughter's birthday) is anyone's guess. Yesterday I had to have her taken to the ER with extreme pain and a new tumor that I could actually feel at the bottom of her right side rib cage. She is 72 years old. She has a touch of pnemonia right now and if she coughs or vomits it could brake a rib or even her back. I was pretty ticked last night when the dr wouldnt admit her (despite the ER dr and nurse wanting her admitted) and because of that I came off kinda harsh at the idea of not taking chemo because of temporary hair loss. This cancer is very serious stuff, and imho anyone ESPECIALLY stage 4 should not play around with it.",

This thread struck a nerve with me only because I see the extreme devestation of it in a person I love more then anything in the world. And I see it every minute of everyday because I am taking care of her and living with her to the end, I even quit work so I could take care of her all the time. For your family, please do whatever the Dr. says (((hugs)))",
