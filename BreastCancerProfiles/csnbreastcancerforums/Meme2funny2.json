    "Content": "Hi, when I went in for my first appointment after my path came back positive , I came out with a plan, except my plan got held off when they found 2 cyst by my right overy. I just had my hyster last week and I have to wait now until December 29th for my mastectomy with a sentinel node biopsy. The only thing I don't know after my first appointment if I will need chemo or/ and radiation and that only because there was not enough on my path report to push me either way yet.",
