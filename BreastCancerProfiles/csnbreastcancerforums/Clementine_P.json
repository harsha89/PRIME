Best, Clementine",

I think letting fall out entirely on its own would just have been really messy and traumatic. For me it was better to shave it and get it over with. The idea of getting it cut really short and then going from there is a good one too, I think. I would recommend getting a couple of cotton caps (to wear in bed and around the house). I also bought a baseball hat with fake hair coming down the sides. I wore that thing to death. It was more comfortable to me than my wig and nobody noticed that it wasn't real hair. I am so sorry that you are having to deal with this right now. I am glad you are feeling better and hope you know that there is an end in sight. Be strong. Clementine_P",

I hope this helps. Clementine",

Feel free to ask any questions here.  Nothing is off limits. Best of luck, Clementine",

      "Content": "Hi, since a couple of people expressed interest in knowing the results of nipple surgery, I thought I would post a quick update. I had my nipple flap surgery last Friday. It was easy, took about an hour, only local anestetic, and I was in the hospital's operating room (not the doctor's office). After the surgery they taped on some plastic \"shapers\". Today I got the shapers removed. Aside from being bruised and discolored, they look really good! The PS basically took a flap of skin (from my breast - he didn't take the skin from elsewhere on my body) and made a nub out of it and then with stitches made an areola. In about 2 months, he will tattoo them pink (before my double mastectomy he took photos of my breasts and so knows the color my nipples used to be). So, by the time I am completely through with the reconstruction, it will be almost exactly a year from when I was diagnosed. I know it is different for everyone, but I am really happy that I went forward with the reconstruction to the end. I didn't have conviction with my choice for quite some time but now seeing the almost finished product, I am thrilled. What a year! Clementine",

I was told by my oncologist that I am now pre-menopausal again. So it took nine months for me to emerge from \"chemopause\". I read an article about this and it basically says that the younger you are the more likely it is for your menopause to be temporary. I think it varies as to how quickly it comes back as well - for some it can return immediately following the end of chemo. I know other women on this board that have said that their cycle came back just as regular as ever. I would talk to your oncologist and ask what s/he thinks. Takde care of yourself. Clementine",
