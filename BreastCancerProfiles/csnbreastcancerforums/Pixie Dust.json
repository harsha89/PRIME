All of the flowers sounds beautiful and a look at all them had to make you feel how much he was loved. I am glad that you have the funeral out of the way. I know it was hard on you and you still have alot to do. You have already showed all of us what a strong woman you are. I wish their was something that I could do for you, because you are always giving advise and helping the pink sisters here on the discussion board and chat room. You will have your moments and that is perfectly alright. It will take time to get where you need to be, but I know you can do it.  Love and Hugs,  Pixie",

When I had surgery pathology report showed I would have gotten cancer in left breast also sooner or later. There is a name for it but I cannot remember it. It is on my pathology report though. Hope your tests are all negative and pray that you have better days ahead.   Hugs and prayers,    Pixie",

Thats what they are here for. They get paid very well. I do good to see my ONC for 5 minutes and his office visit is over 300 dollars. Can you imagine how much money he is making I have neuropathy really bad in my feet, toes and right hand and fingers caused by chemo. Built myself up to 600mg of neuroton 3 times a day and it has helped me 75%. Hope you do well with your therapy. (HUGS)   Pixie",

Although all people react differently with chemo that I have heard a alot even keeps their jobs and works everyday because it does not bother them. I had a score of 30 and had no choice but take it. My decision would be if I had a  score of 22 I would take chemo, because of the reason if it ever returned I can say I tried everything and have no regrets. Hope whatever you decide you do well in the future. (HUGS) Pixie",

I have only been fighting it since Jan.2013 and I am almost insane  with all the ups and downs that I have had. You are exactly right when you said we are all in this together but some are worse than others. And the insurance companies can drive you insane so much that you could probably get disability from it. My husband had to pay out $545.00 dollars the other day for a special blood thinner that he could only go on. This was only for 30 days. He has to stay on it for 6 months or longer for a blood clot in his leg. To make a long story short insurance will not pay for it, nor my gabapentin for neuropathy or my arimidex that I have to take for five years and they are expensive also. Thats not including a 16,000.000 dollar bill that they said they were not paying after I had a masectomy and surgeon had to go back and do surgery for repairs that needed to be done. Everyone has ups and downs. More has them more than othersand worse. Life seems it is not fair. The rich keeps getting richer and the poor keeps getting poorer. I know its hard saying this, but hold your head up and start fighting this wicked ssa like you have for many years. Hope your throat trouble turns out to be nothing, but if not there are plenty of meds out there now that can fight this since you have had cancer in 2002. Let us know how u r doing.  (HUGS AND PRAYERS)   Pixie",

You surely have something to  be gratefull for being NED for 22yrs. I have heard from alot of people that have bone mets and received good medical treatments with perfectly good results. You need to get back on here 24/7 so you do not have to go through this by yourself with people on here just like you. I like the discussion board and also like the chat room. Get back on chat room and meet new people. You may even meet someone on there that you chatted with years ago. I love the chat room because everybody there is all together chatting with one another giving support, encourangement, laughter and love to one another. I pray you will do wonders with your new treatments and meet NED again soon. I hope to see you more on here on discussion board and especially chat room. I will be waiting on you with others to chat with you soon.  ((((( HUGS )))))   Pixie Dust ",
