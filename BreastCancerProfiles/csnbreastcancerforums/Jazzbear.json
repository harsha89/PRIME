    "Content": "I had a lymph node under my arm removed in April of 2012.  I had both chemo and radiation.  Finished radiation in November of 2012.  My breast is still tender to the touch although not as pronounced as it was post-radiation.  My skin healed well and I never had any blisters.  It just looked and felt sunburned.  It still feels a little burned.  The area of my chest where I had the port is sometimes tender too.  It feels like there are some adhesions there that pull a little when I move a certain way.  The radiation oncologist said that my skin would probably be tender for about two years but it still is at almost three years.  It is definitely better than it was though.",
