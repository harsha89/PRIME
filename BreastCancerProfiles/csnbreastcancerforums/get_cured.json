    "Content": "I got diagnosed with Cancer on Feb 18th 2008. I got free flap reconstruction doubly maestectomy done on April 15th. My god it was so hard... I felt like I was hit by a truck. It took me 2 months to recover that with still some tightness of the stomach. However now after 6 months and 8 chemos, I am feeling better. I am at the gym twice a week. I have gained weight from chemo and tamoxofin but my stomach is beutiful and flat i have a huge iscision on my lower abdomen from hip bone to hip bone. It does get over ... Hang in there with lots of love and prayers. Mickie",
