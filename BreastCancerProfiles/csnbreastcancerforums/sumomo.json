    "Content": "I have a pain in my arm muscle (bicep) especially when I stretch. It started after completing the 6 months of chemo (AC + T). The lymph nodes were removed from the armpit and my arm mobility was limited after the surgery 8 months ago but it was fully recovered in a few months, therefore I was able to move my arm fully without any problem during the chemo. Now I cannot move my arm well so it's like getting back the post-surgery condition. The arm is not swelled so it doesn't seem to be lymphedema. Not sure if it is a chemo side effect, but it never happened during the chemo. Has anyone had a same or similar experience?  ",
