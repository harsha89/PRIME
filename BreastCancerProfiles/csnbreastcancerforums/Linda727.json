    "Content": "Does anyone have Her-2 Overexpression and Ki-67 as strong positive 3+ as a diagnosis? Tumor was extremely small at 0.3 centimeters. No spread! I had a left breast mastectomy last Sept. followed by 4 rounds of chemo-/adriamycin, cytoxan, and taxotere. Not on anything now because there is nothing to do but hope it doesn't return. If so, then go on Herceptin. Please respond if you have had this diagnosis. How many check-ups do you have? How often do you get a blood test? Thanks so much.",
