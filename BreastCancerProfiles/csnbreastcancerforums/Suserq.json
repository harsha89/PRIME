      "Content": "Hi everyone!! Until you hear those words \" you have cancer\" I do not think you REALLY understand. You pray for others and feel bad for them but nothing is like knowing how they really feel. I run a bingo in Saint Louis for the Ladies VFW Auxiliary. We always give money to cncer and research and had raffles to raise money. We sell cancer ink dabbers and also have sold cancer awareness pull tabs. I really never felt it in my heart what we were doing. Now that I am a \"sister\" I am going to try even harder to have events to help our cause. Some day I hope to say our group helped find a cure. I am hoping to have a Sunday that the whole day theme is cancer awareness. Susan",

      "Content": "Well today is my last chemo treatment. Six months of adriamycin. Things have been going well. Was getting transfusions every 2 weeks now it has been 14 weeks since I needed blood. Was wondering if anyone has had this side effect. The past 4 weeks I have headaches everyday. The past 2 days they have been so severe it makes me vomit. They did an MRI of my brain and no sign of cancer there Hurray!!! They thoughtmaybe sinus but the ENT saysthe pain I am describing is not typical for sinus. Has anyone had this? Was thinking maybe my body is reaching it's limit of chemo. The headaches wake me up at night. They gaveme pain pills but I would really like to know what is causing the headaches. Any thoughts?",
