    "Content": "My eyes watered and my nose ran non stop through my chemo - 4 A/C and 12 Taxol. I too went to the eye doctor to make sure I didn't have a blocked tear duct or something. It is 6 weeks now since my last Taxol and the watery eyes have improved, but still have the runny nose! I have a tissue in my hand at all times! Hopefully that will stop too once the hair in my nose grows back.",
