    "Content": "Hi Karen, My name is Sharon and I first had the lumpectomy then a few months later the masectomy. The only gross thing is the bag hanging that has to be drained. Chemo is tuff and as everyone says different for all people. You will loose your hair two weeks after your first chemo, at least the bulk of it. It is so much better to just cut it off. My hair was real long and started getting everywhere so I shaved it also. Now I wear hats and pin different color flowers on them to match what I am wearing, wigs are hot and itchy. I think not having to fix your hair everyday is just one less thing you will have to deal with so in a way it is good. Somedays you will be fine some days you won't want to get out of bed. Give yourself a break if you possible can when you are feeling bad. In the beginning chemo is manageable. The middle and ending chemo treatments are for the tuff and brave. Cancer is not for wimps!!!!! Take care of yourself and I wish you the best.",
