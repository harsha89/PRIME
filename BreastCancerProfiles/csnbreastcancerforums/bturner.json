    "Content": "I think you can see from the replies that almost everyones hair comes back different. I finished my chemo in October of last year and it was actually about July before I felt my hair was getting back to normal. I had always had some wave, but it came back kinky curly. I went thru what my hairdresser called a \"psychological state\" because I could not bear the thought of cutting it, but once I got over that and had about 2 good haircuts, it is now back to normal. as far as the color, I had it highlighted before I ever took my wig off (5 months after my last chemo) and it did not seem to hurt it at all. The color did not seem alot different but I had coloring and highlights for so long didn't really know what \"natural\" color was. I never dreamed I would wear my hair as short as it was when I first took my wig off, but I got up one morning, started to put my wig on and said to myself, \"I'm not doing this another day\". I called my hairdresser, got some highlights and the wig came off that day. Just remember when you \"take the wig off\", it's an opportunity for a whole new look. And, hang in there, your hair will get back to normal!",
