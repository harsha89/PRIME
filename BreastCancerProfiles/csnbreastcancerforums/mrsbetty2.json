      "Content": "Leslie, Congratulations on using the new procedure for fighting breast cancer.When i had my surgery, this wasn't even an option. Then about 4 months later one of our local hospitals was advertising it. Wish it had been an option for me, but i opted for the total breast removal.Went thru 8 chemo treatments and now on Arimidex for 5 years. Hopefully we have beat the beast. My prayers to you. Betty",
