    "Content": "Heather There's a cancer workshop (Look Good Feel Better) sponsored by the American Cancer Society. Phone 1-800-395-5665 or you can go on-line to www.lookgoodfeelbetter.org. Trained cosmetologist volunteers bring each participant a basket of \"free\" cosmetics and they teach you the proper techniques to apply make-up (such as applying a lost brow line) and they also give guidance on the use of wigs, scarves, hats, skin care. If one of these workshops is not available in your area call the # anyway and they will send a video including an instructional booklet showing all the techniques. One message they try to convey to all cancer patients is not to use \"old\" make-up (bacterial infection possibility). I myself am scheduled for one of their workshops this coming Wednesday. Hope your Mom's results turn out to be negative but if not, you're right, you'll be such a treasure of experience & info for her. Stay Positive, Judy",
