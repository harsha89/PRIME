I too work at an elementary school & am having my surgery on June 14th so I can have the rest of the summer to recooperate. I finished my treatments in February of this year. Please pray for me, as I am scared too. Jean",

      "Content": "I too have read so many articles on the benefits of tamoxifen and I have also read the heartbreaking stories of those who have suffered from side effects. I am on my 2nd year of it. I have had debilitating side effects and will continue to take it for as long as I can. I was switched to it from femara, which was worse. I am doing the best I can. I called the American Cancer Society hotline and spoke to a oncology nurse about my pain and frustration with these drugs, that for some women, are terrible. She said that it is one of the top issues that they deal with and that new studies are being done all the time to try and lessen the pain that so many of us endure. So, my message is, you must do what you can and not feel pressured or guilty if you can't. We are all so different and some of these drugs are just so hard to take. Please don't think you just have to endure it. Speak to your doctor and maybe something else will help.",

      "Content": "Hi all, I am almost 2 years in to my \"after treatment\" life. I started on femara and had terrible side effects. I am now on tamoxifen and trying to deal with it. The side effects are still there, but I am trying to \"make do. I gained about 20 lbs and for the past 6 months or so , I have been trying to get my strength back. I used to be able to walk 10,000 steps a day and now I can do 6,000, but it is painful. I have bone and joint paint and terrible pain in my feet in the morning. After I walk, it is better, but at night that is when the pain is worse. I take a hydrocodone pill at night to help me sleep. Sometimes during the day I take aleve to help. What do you all do? Everyone says get out there and exercise, but sometimes it is SO DIFFICULT! Femara and tamoxifen have taken their toll on me, but I kepp plugging away! Any similar stories? Jean",
