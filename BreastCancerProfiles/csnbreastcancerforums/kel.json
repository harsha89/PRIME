    "Content": "Hi, I would suggest checking out Leslie Sansone's Walk at Home dvds. She has many on the market and I can do these workouts even though I have a bum ankle and HATE to exercise. She uses very simple steps but can really get you up and moving and that is key. She has done some videos that go with Nutrisytem and Weight Watcher's programs as well. I discovered her when I used Nutrisystem a couple of years ago. I lost a lot of weight then (40 pounds in 5 months). I am now getting my energy levels back to where I want to exercise again (after several months of surgery and treatments) and have bought a couple of her newer dvd sets. I am doing very well and focusing on being healthier more than just losing weight. I have lost four pounds in just a few weeks. There is an online \"Walk Club\" that you can join for support if you want to try that. There is a yearly fee but there are free videos on the website that make it worth the price if you just use those. The women there have been very supportive. Do some research and see what you think. No matter what you decide, GOOD LUCK.",
