      "Content": "I opted for a port in my inner arm and I have been so pleased with it. I was at a teaching hospital and I had a choice of a wanna-be doctor fresh off the press inserting it in my chest or a nurse practitioner with 15 years experience putting it in my arm using ultrasound. I swim daily and it does not bother me in any way.",

      "Content": "I was really torn up trying to decide what to do before my mastectomy. I didn't know about this board and I knew virtually no one that had gone through what I was about to do. I felt so isolated and devastated. I polled practically everyone who would stand still long enough for me to ask what they thought I should do. No one had the answer. I got everything from listen to the docs to it was barbaric to have my breast amputated and to take poison chemo. I should eat these mushrooms and pray. One said I got cancer because I didn't drink alkaline water. Another said I was plagued of the devil to have cancer and ignorant of the Lord to not have perfect healing. I stopped asking everyone else and asked myself what I wanted. I realized that I know nothing about hearing the true voice of the Lord but what I know is true is that his voice will instill a peace within me as I hear it. You and your experience are special. Just listen for the peace that will accompany the right decision. Yes, you may second guess yourself and doubt you made the right decision at times but tell yourself you made the best decision you could with the knowledge you had at the time and forgive yourself if everything doesn't turn out perfectly.",
