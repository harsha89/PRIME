      "Content": "Hi - I was Stage IIB TNBC.  My onc had me use 2 rounds of Taxotere and Cytoxan because I had a heart issue I was investigating just prior to my cancer diagnosis.  He said there was a cardiac risk, although small, if I used Adriamycin.  So while I am a survivor (3 years) I didn't have the Adriamycin - just the Cytoxin.  I know this isn't quite what you were looking for but I wanted you to know my onc advised against the use.",

      "Content": "Kathi, I saw that nobody had responded yet. Probably because it's just so hard to find the right words. From what I've learned of you over the past year(ish), you are a caring and wonderful person. What I've learned from bc over the past year(ish)is that this is not a dress rehearsal. We all deserve what's best for us. Unfortunately sometimes what's best for us changes over time. Whatever you decide, do what feels right in your heart. Make your decision and find peace with it. Hugs, Michele",
