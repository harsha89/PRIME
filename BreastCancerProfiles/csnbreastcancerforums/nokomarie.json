    "Content": "I am closing in on the last month of five years of tamoxifen and I actually think I might live through it. My oncology nurse practitioner put me on effexor and it made a little difference and then my regular doctor put me on effexor xr. Helps a little, but on even semi warm days I look like a melted, red faced, sweaty mess. I always wonder if people in the grocery store think I have something contagious. I will be glad when this is over. I did find a couple of things that helped during the summer. A cool handkerchief around my neck helped and then I found a product that you can put in the freezer and put around your neck that keeps cooling for at least an hour or so. The product is called Black Ice and it worked for me. Looks a little dorky, but better than being \"drippy\"! Hope you find something to work for you. Best wishes!!",
