    "Content": "It is much more important to go off the tamoxifen a few months (at least 3, 6 is better) before getting pregnant, then to finish exactly 5 years of it. Tamoxifen can cause birth defects and it takes a while to rid it all from your body. I only did two years of tamoxifen then stopped to have a baby and now I'm back on (after beautiful baby :). I don't recommend this to everyone, but this was my decision to go against the doctors recommendation and stop early. My age was a factor (I was 39). So if you've already done almost 5 years and really HAVE to have a baby this year than please first get off the tamoxifen. A few months will not make much difference to your body. Five years is a guesstimate of what the latest studies show. They were doing studies that say maybe two years of tamoxifen is enough. I'm not sure if those results are out yet, but that helped me make my well researched decision. I don't think your husband should put that type of pressure on you by thinking you have to have a baby this year, these things can take a while. You have to let your body go at it's own pace too and hurrying it can cause stress on you both. I miscarried the first pregnancy, but then got pregnant again four months later. That is very normal (miscarriage) but it can push off your plans and upset your expectations. As you say let it be in God's hands but that means no expectaions and most of all be safe and protect God's gift. Quit the Tamoxifen First! Good luck, I know you'll be blessed.",
