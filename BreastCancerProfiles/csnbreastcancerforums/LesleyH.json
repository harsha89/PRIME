      "Content": "EVISTA (raloxifene) has been shown to be nearly as effective as tamoxifen in preventing breast cancer in high risk women. The problem, of course, is in defining high risk women. Most of the women at high-risk would not have got it anyway. It may not apply to those of us who actually have had breast cancer. It has not been researched head-to- head with tamoxifen or any of the aromatase inhibitors. If you already have had breast cancer, it is unlikely to be used - at least not yet. Hugs. Lesley",

I have found my relationship with people has really shifted. I now see people as those who get it and those who don't. That is, those who can fly and those who cannot. I have drifted away from former friends. I think chemo changes you. It makes you stronger and wiser. And those who don't get it, just don't get it. Hugs. Lesley",

It smells wonderful and lavender does double duty: the smell helps you sleep and lavender is good for burns. The radiation onc was very impressed with my skin - no burns even though I am very fair. I was not allowed to put it on before the treatment, but I found it very soothing afterwards. No itching. I still use it. The onc thought it worked better than anything she could prescribe. Good luck with the rads. Hugs. Lesley",

      "Content": "You are doing a lot. First of all, I guess you will need chemo because of your Her status. Yes? The oncs usually advise no supplements during chemo and radiation - in case the supplements protect the cancer cells as well as the body. I think your diet is excellent. I always recommend Diana Dyer's website and book. The URL is www.cancerrd.com I read all research avidly. I think your exercise is terribly important. I have a pedomenter and walk 5 miles outside every day - even in the snow. I take everything you take and a couple more. The vitamin E I take is Isomer E. I know it is controversial (and I am ER+/PR+), but I eat soy every day. Not supplements. Soy milk, miso or tofu. I eat no red meat at all and organic chicken very rarely. I mainly eat salmon (wild caught not farm raised) and sardines. I eat broccoli or cabbage every day. I also eat/drink lowfat yoghurt and lowfat milk (organic). I eat mushrooms almost every day (including Shiitake mushroom at least once a week) and I eat beans every day. I eat about 15 servings of fruit/veggies a day. I eat olives every day and only use olive oil. (Most olive oil you buy is not really olive oil. Put it in the refrigerator. If it doesn't cloud over, it's not olive oil.) I also add wheat germ. wheat bran, rice bran, flax, prunes, 2 Brazil nuts, and other frozen, fresh and dried fruit to my oatmeal. Like Diana, I believe that diet is more important than supplements. Nevertheless, I also take (beyond those you mentioned) astragalus, pycnogenol, Evening Primrose Oil, CoQ10, Alpha Lipoic Acid, B-50. I am sure that I take too many and will probably start cutting down as I get stronger. For now, that is what I find useful. I take melatonin when I can't sleep. Hope some of this/any of this helps.

He claims tha only about 15-20% of patients are willing to make life-style changes after a cancer diagnosis. If this is true, and if it applies to you then CONGRATULATIONS! You are exceptional. Hugs.

Then every day - about 2 hours later. The rad onc said it was not from the rads. But, seriously, 2 hours later only M - F? I knew it had to be. Then I went to see my medical onc. She said that the radiation people never admit that rads can cause nausea - but it can. Here's wishing you smooth sailing with the only hassle being that you have to go every day. Hugs. Lesley",

      "Content": "I totally agree with you, Tara. That is why I research everything. I only rely on good academic research studies for my information. Medline is my favorite - I subscribe through the university (I have 2 Master's degrees and almost a PhD.) I know that most of the research has been done in test tubes - but we have to take what we can get. If it works in a test tube and will not harm me then I am willing to try it. I think news reports about medicine and drugs are positively dangerously deceptive. I understand statistics and go over all the statistics really carefully. I never rely on information I find on random websites, anecdotal evidence, or books by quacks. (Have you read any of that QUACKERY from Gary Null? I was so annoyed I looked up his PhD - it's one of those that don't require a systematic study. Uh huh.) I would never choose supplements over an FDA approved drug. I know others do, but I would not. I feel it is irresponsible to promote that. I think that is what you were trying to emphasize. And I completely agree. Hugs. Lesley",

If you have others that look exactly like the one on your breast, they are age spots and quite normal. If this one looks different, I'd go back and check with the doctor just for the peace of mind.
