      "Content": "Hi Ira. I'm sorry to hear about your Mom. I live in Rockland County NY which is right next door to Bergen County, which is where I assume your Mom lives. Sloan is very well known as a top rated Cancer Center, and I've been there for second opinions. But I go to Hackensack University, which is becoming very well known in this area for it's Cancer Center as well. I just find it much easier to go there instead of into NYC to Sloan, especially since I really believe that most of these places are all on the same page as far as treatment. I haven't heard anything bad about Englewood Hospital...I'm sorry, that's probably not much help. Best of luck to both of you!",

      "Content": "i have been getting Zometa every month for six years. I had the very same reaction that you did my first time. I had no training, as a matter of fact they told me I wouln't have any reaction at all. I thought I had the flu. I had to call the dr and ask if I was reacting to something. Anyway, after that they started giving me a Benadryl before my treatment, and it worked wonders. After a while I was able to stop taking the benadry first - I guess my body got used to it. I hope your body gets used to it as well - maybe you can ask about the benadryl? Good luck to you!",
