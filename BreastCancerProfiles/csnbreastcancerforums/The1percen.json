      "Content": "I have come to realize that some of my posts may not be \"supportive\"... part of the reason I came to this board was that I/me \"personally\" have only had \"bad\" experiences with this disease and I needed SUPPORT. I am scared and I express that all too well. I hope everyone understands I mean no harm with MY \"negativity\". My wife was reminding last night that she has 2 aunts that are BC survivors! I will TRY to \"think\" before I post... I TRULY AM SORRY!! Mike",

      "Content": "Hi Bill, I think it's time I introduced myself, \"formally\"! I imagine you have read some of my posts already, but in case you haven't I am Mike, I am 52 and have these lumps in my breasts for something 1-1Â½ but 1. waited thinking they would \"go away\" and 2. was in denial that it could be cancer until I started feeling other lumps in my Lymphnodes. I am scheduled for a Mammogram next Friday and I see a surgeon on the 30th. I am holding out hope that it ISN'T and everyone wants me to be positive that it isn't, but until I actually talk to the surgeon, it will be hard to to have faith, especially with some HIGH risk factors, including a sister that had BC in her early 20s and had \"something\" precancerous on her ovaries so they did a hysterectomy. My Dad has/had PC and 2 of his brothers died of PC. Everybody here has been very supportive concidering, I don't even the diagnosis yet and I figure even if I get \"good\" results, I will stay a member of the board, since even if if isn't NOW, it could be later, and I will still have the emotional scars of that possibility. Hope everything is good with your battle. Take Care & God Bless, Mike",

      "Content": "Thank you, and yes it can be a B*T*H, but then again I also feel quite fortunate to have the \"coverage\" I do. I served in a period before \"the middle-east\" and a lot of the new guys and gals coming back are facing a whole different ball-game. The Government now tries to \"limit their liability\" and that S**KS!!! The waiting IS the hardest part... especially when you know that IF IT IS, it is still growing and since I am a guy and ignored it to start with, if it is then it is stage 4 and I have to partially blame myself, so how can I complain??? I am SOOOO GLAD I came here though, there has been SOOOOO much support for me and everyone that I can't imagine going through it without my new FAMILY!!!! Thank you all for you kind comments!!! Take Care & God Bless, Mike",

I have tried to be supportive and honest, it isn't easy being here under these circumstances and as I was rereading the thread, I noticed that I WAS FLAGGED!!! At this point I am sitting here crying and wondering if I should drop out. I am sorry if I offended someone. Goodbye, Mike",

Has anyone heard of the Regional Cancer Centers? How closely are the surgical and radiological \"branches\" associated? I thought about going to my wife's surgeon (the she was going to for her Gallbladder) I know he does breast surgery, but I don't know about his radiological side? ANY suggestions would be greatly appreciated... THANK YOU IN ADVANCE! Mike",
