    "Content": "Hi, I did my chemo dose dense, every 2 weeks instead of every 3 as recommended. I also had taxatere. I too work for a very small company and I am single, live alone, so I had to work (needed the $, job and insurance) I too did my chemo Thursday and went back to work on Monday. I was scared out of my mind of chemo, but what I found is it was not nearly as bad as I thought. Someone else posted they took every after effect drug offered and so did I. It is very do-able to work through chemo and radiation. It also helps to keep you focused. You will also find people will come out of the woodwork to help you. I have met so many wonderful people through my treatments. I am sure you will too.",
