Blood pouring would have done it for me! I'm glad it all turned out OK and you're feeling lucky. Enjoy Easter, your family, and hopefully lovely gardening weather! Angie",

      "Content": "I'm wondering how long you waited after surgery before starting radiation? I have 3 more weekly Taxols to go, and, if those don't get delayed, then have surgery (lumpectomy) scheduled for the last Thursday in June. Have any of you started radiation as early as 3 weeks and 3 days after surgery? I'm trying to figure out if I can get done with radiation (6 weeks) before a trip we had planned for September. My MO says that with me being Triple Negative, I can't wait til after the trip for the radiation and the radiation can't be broken up. So, do you think it is likely to work out starting the radiation as I said above and finishing just 1 week before leaving on a trip? Will I be recovered from the radiation? I know everyone is different, but if you could share your experience with me, it would be helpful. As always, thanks for being here! Angie",

I am also triple negative ,diagnosed the first of the year, and just finished radiation Monday. Welcome to our group that no one wanted to be eligible for! Come any time to vent, ask questions, or share experiences. I hope your sister gets a good report and gets left out of our group! Angie",

      "Content": "Since I first posted here on Jan 2, it has been a whirlwind of phone calls, tests, and appointments. I've had a CT scan, bone scan, and breast MRI, plus the receptor tests were finished. No mets, thankfully, but triple negative and aggressive--75% on the KI67 proliferation index. If the mugascan to check heart output is OK, I will be starting chemo on Tuesday: 4 every 2 week rounds of Adriamycin and Cytoxan, 12 weeks Taxol, 3 weeks recovery, surgery, 6 weeks radiation. (My husband will also be starting an Esophageal cancer clinical trial the next Tuesday with Taxol and a Phase II antibody.) Any experiences, words of wisdom, helpful hints, things to watch out for would be greatly welcomed! It's beginning to sink in that this is really happening. Have my big girl panties ready and shopping for BLACK boxing gloves (loved that.) Angie",

      "Content": "I've always been a BIG believer in checking off Bucket List items and giving up other stuff to make it happen. Then,in this last year or so, my husband and I really believe those goals we keep setting are playing a part in good results. As I've mentioned before, my husband was diagnosed with Stage IV Esophageal Cancer in June 2011. We had started what we hoped would be a tradition with our grands to take each one on a little \"dream\" trip of their choice when they were 11. Grand # 3's trip was due to start 4 days after his diagnosis. After we stopped crying, and with our PCP and MO's encouragement, we went on with 5 days in San Diego then a trip back up to her home in WA on the Amtrak Coast Starlight. SOOO glad we did it! He then started chemo the day after we got home. Also, just 2 days after his diagnosis we had to decide on buying trip insurance with no pre-existing conditions on an Oct trip we had been planning for a year. We decided having the trip to look forward to through chemo was worth the risk of the expense of the insurance. And we talked about and researched that trip from June until Oct. He was able to take a chemo break and we completely enjoyed a Voyages to Antiquity cruise to Rome, Sicily, Tunisia, Malta, Crete, Rhodes, Turkey, and Cyprus. Then, after I was diagnosed and he was back on chemo, our goal was to get to WA to see our newest twin granddaughters. And--we did it in June. Nothing like holding grand babies!! Since April, we've been planning on a Rhine and Mosel River Cruise after my treatment is finished and he's on a chemo break. (Some co-pays can just wait.) God willing, we leave on Sep 9 for that. It does seem like the crises, the chemo, the radiation, etc are easier to get through with something to look forward to. We are so grateful that we have been able to enjoy these things after being totally blind sided and devastated 14 months ago. Angie",
