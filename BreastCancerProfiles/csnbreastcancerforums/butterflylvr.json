My original doctor was out of the office my graduation week so this was the first time I've seen him in a month. He pulls a sheet out of my file that the \"Substitute Dr.\" had written upon my discharge describing all my owies. He read aloud a long paragraph of words I didn't even understand. Upon finishing he looked up at me and without missing a beat I said \"Yup sounds about right\". We both had a good laugh and then he ordered me up on the exam table. LOL... now for some reason he wants to see me back in six months.Something about wanting to see how the skin is healing after my implant exchange surgery. Oh well what's one more visit down the road? While I was there I did pop back to see if my Rad Tech girls remembered me. Anna says to me \"Do we remember you? We have a picture of you up on our walls\". Now mind you at first I panicked thinking most of the pictures of me that they took were of my naked foobs (fake boobs)with my rad tattoos. I had to chuckle myself when I saw the picture she was speaking of was that of me holding the cake I brought in for my graduation party. Needless to say we all got a good laugh when I told them of the pictures I was thinking of because centerfold material I am not. Haha... Lorrie",

      "Content": "My tumor was detected just like yours. My left nipple started retracting inwards and it felt hard too. I also had some skin dimpling. Without knowing what your biopsy results will find, since my nipple retracted too, I was diagnosed as IDC (Invasive Ductile Carcinoma) the most common form of breast cancer. It starts in the milk duct and can spread beyond that. My tumor didn't spread but just grew and grew... So I had to have a mastectomy because a lumpectomy would have left a caved in breast. I opted to have them both removed. Yes, everything is a whirlwind right now and that's a good thing. The sooner your doctors can assess the tumor the faster you can get treatment. Now with that in mind, don't think the worse about everything or you will worry yourself silly. I had to do chemo, surgery, radiation because of the tumor size and I am now on hormone therapy (Arimidex) to block my estrogen. Every course of treatment they can give you betters your odds of survival. Listen to your doctors and do research. This website The American Cancer Society is a great place for that. I am sure if you even looked hard enough there will even be an article or two on when and how to tell family member. We are here to hold your hand though your journey, just reach out for us.

I was given 4 infusions three weeks apart. After your surgery they knew exactly which type of cancer you are dealing with so your treatment plans changed. Many of the women on this board blazed the same trail you are about to go through and I am sure you will find great advice from them. My tumor took me down a different route then yours but either way that first day of chemo can be so scary. The others offered you some great advice, after you get that first one under your belt you will just blaze right through all this. After your first treatment you will know how your body responds and you will soon figure out your good days and bad days. On those good days you can be mommy to all those precious children of yours, but on your bad days... let them pamper you. You will be amazed at how important they will feel just running after a pillow for you or getting you a glass of water. Mary take our hand and let us walk with you through those chemo doors and we promise to never leave your side. Post away any concerns and I guarantee you will find you have so much strength within you never realized you had. It is truly amazing when you realize this... Hugs my dear, Lorrie",

She will remind you to \"be stronger than not angry at\" and now is indeed time to heed these powerful words.   She is the light in our hearts, the strength in our souls and the inspiration to help the other fellow kindreds to do good unto others and to remain strong.   I have been lucky enough to have had her in my life longer than anyone, days, months, years of memories and she has shaped me into the person I am today and will live out my days always asking myself \"what would Chen do?\" when I'm faced with life's challenges. She and I encourage you all to do the same now and always..   Raise a glass, light a candle, say a prayer, for our 50 foot woman.",

I don't really know what to think of it but if it's bothering you too much maybe a phone call is in order to answer some of your questions and concerns. Try and stay positive maybe it's that whole man versus women thing, words don't always come across the way they should or the way we feel they should.

I like Jennifer above me just completed my radiation phase, prior to that I had a double mastectomy and chemo. I only had the tumor in my left breast and a lumpectomy wasn't an option for me. I also made the decision at the time too to remove my right healthy breast as well because I wanted to prevent if I could having to go down this road again. Are you still going to have to do chemo and radiation once you have a mastectomy? You are so brave, it's not an easy decision to make and it was once I grappled with for quite some time because I had chemotherapy first. I will be thinking and praying for you this Thursday.

She was so grateful there was a place she could go where she could level about how she felt and also support others in their struggle to find a way beyond this awful disease. We miss her so much and I am so grateful that she was loved so well by all of you. I know it made the difference to her recovery from each of her surgeries that she had so many praying & hoping for her improved health. Katrina had fabulous friends and I know all you ladies looked to her as a daughter and she was lucky to have so many doting Moms. I could love on her and empathize with her losses and her pain, but you guys really knew how she felt, so she didn't feel alone. I'm so grateful she found you when she needed you, and I hope all of you will hold her memory dear. She loved you guys and you enriched her life. She wore the bracelet you sent her and was thrilled to get it. I got an ornament to send for her exchange and then with everything going on didn't get to send it. I'm sorry about that... Thank you for everything Joan & Gary Larson",

My plastic surgeon didn't hesitate with immediate reconstruction. If your Plastic surgeon is telling you to lose the weight before surgery seek a second opinion. Keep in mind implants only cover a certain circumference of the chest wall. My implants are currently in place but I need a little bitl of fat grafting around near the armpit area and they should be fine. I went from a DD before cancer to a C cup implant size.
