    "Content": "My treatments also include Dexamethasone, Doxil, taxotere along with the herceptin. I do not get a symptoms from the herceptin but I do get the worst symptoms from the Taxotere! Im going on my 4th treatment of Taxotere & my symptoms are 3 days later which include the stiffness, nervousness, and lack of sleep. My head also feels so tight for at least a week later. I thought I would get use to the symptoms of the Taxotere but they still come on full force each time and I have 4 more to go. I don't want jinx myself but when I don't mind going for the Herceptin! Good luck on the rest of your treatments and if you have any tips to give me I would really appreciate anything. Thanks Onyx",
