      "Content": "Hi Linda, I am so greteful to have the ability to help you. I have never had a blood clot in my leg but both of my brothers did (deep wein thrombosis), but I had it in my lungs (after failing down some stairs). It is very painful. As hard as it may seem right now you are very lucky to not have the clot go into your lung or heart. Actually everyday since last week I have been giving myself blood thinning injections also in the stomach. It doesn't hurt that much but somehow it unnerves me. You too. It is very hard having something like this happen because the doctors have to make a decision as to whether to put you on a blood thinner (warfarin) for the rest of your life (which I always miss). That is hard to take because your blood level (INR) have to be checked regularly. I felt lik a china doll. they told me that I couldn't eat a lot of foods and I would bruise easily. I take these warnings with a grain of salt and eatanything I want and esp. like to drink Calif wine. You will get through this. I had a blood clot in my lung. No fun. I have been fighting accepting the fact that I have to be on blood thinners. It is so wonderful connecting with someone. Please feel free to e-amil me on my rgular e-mail (this one is so confusing). It is JThyme1@aol.com. Take care and we will talk very soon. P.S. what is Taxol? and what is 4 AC DD? And would you like to share why you have to have chemo? Jeanne Now I have breast cancer and being on blood thinners has complicated things. I go in for a lumpectomy on Thursday and I am scared I will get a blood clot after surgery.",
