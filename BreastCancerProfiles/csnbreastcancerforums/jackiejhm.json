We ended up skipping the first chemo-yay( one awful go round was icky enough). But, she was very, very cautious about those cotton-picking-important margins, Bless her heart!xoxo",

Now, someone in the chemo suite told me to take claritin (allergy med otc) the morning of and every 4 hours throughout the day of the neulasta shot. I did it the last 3 rounds- maybe it was all in my head, but, it really helped with the aching. You know the sleep aid seemed to work 3-4 days after chemo for me. Thank goodness for Ativan. Keep drinking all the liquids you can!!!! That is so important. Hang in there- you can do this. Hey, If I can- YOU can!! Keep us posted!xoxoxoxo Jackie",

For me, I am a college level instructor, and my Onc had me sit out one semester of hands on teaching last Spring. That meant, no classroom work. With community \"germs and illness\" so prevalent in school, he felt my depressed immune system would do better sticking with office/home hours better. I am here and getting stronger everyday now and looking forward to classroom work next month. I hope your employer will allow you the flexibility to find what works for you.
