    "Content": "Mine is like jujubeez, ER+/PR+/Her2-, score was 13 with the recurrance rate of 8%. Both my breast surgeon and oncologist said that chemo wouldn't change the percentage rate much, only about 1%. So for me, it was just a lumpectomy, radiation (currently during rads) and then estrogen blockers for 5 years. I keep hoping that I made the right decision, but if it does come back then I plan to go more aggressive. It's a tought decision and wishing you the best.",
