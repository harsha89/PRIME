      "Content": "I had a mastectomy on my left breast on 11/5/2012 they put in two drains. They took out the last drain a week ago on 11/27/2012. I am still having a lot of pain in my breast bone, in the breast area under my arm,in my arm and around to my back. I haven't heard anyone mention pain. I also wonder about any type of follow up treatment. My surgeon said probably not, but I meet up with the oncologist Tuesday. Should I ask about doing follow up or not. I had Angiosarcoma cancer from radiation treatments on cancer 5 years ago. they done another lumpectomy thinking they had it all, two and a half months the cancer was back. Then they did the mastectomy. This is three times. Should I have some type of follow up treatment? Not sure what to do. Thank you.",

      "Content": "I had so much trouble with my drains. I had my mastectomy the first part of November 2012 He took my drains out the last of November I think it was a big mistake , him taking the drains out. I kept filling up with fluid I had to go back one a week sometimes every other week, so he could take a tube and needle and go around in my chest area and draw fluid off until around March 2013 when I started radiation. After radiation the fluid became thick and I  was getting damage from the draining it couldn't be done anymore. It hurts a lot in that area. So unlike you I wish they would have left the drain in another month as long as any fluid was coming out. That was just my experience, yours could be different I pray and hope all goes well with whatever your journey is.",

      "Content": "Hello friends. I may take a long time to answer reply's, and I will miss spell words. I had a stroke behind my eye and cannot see well from that eye I have cataracts. I use a magnifying glass to read the screen and type. I was still hurting under my arm ,my arm and around from under my arm to middle of my chest and still have the bloody drainage. I took everyone's advice and asked the oncologist that I first saw instead of asking the surgeon again. He ordered an ex ray for Friday. I hope its nothing but it worry's me. They are going to do my surgery February the fifteenth. I am not sure how deep or wide it will be. So I could come home the same day or it will be longer, not sure. He thinks it has spread so do I . It probably hasn't but when he thinks it has its usually so, I wonder about draining me after surgery and during radiation. I wish it would not come back for a while. This has been four cancers sense August of 2012. Hope this is the last. I will keep you posted.  Pray for me on the fifteenth of February, that the surgery does well. I will pray for every one. Thank you all so much for listening.",
