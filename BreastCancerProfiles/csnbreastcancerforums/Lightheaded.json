    "Content": "I had a lumpectomy in 2003 and was treated with a round of 3 chemos, then 6 weeks of radiation then 3 more chemos. I now suffer from some form of cognative damage. I feel \"drunk\" and lightheaded all the time. I believe that we are \"test subjects\" and the doctors do not know the long term side affect of these drugs. Yes they kill the cancer, but what else are they damageing? Check out \"Post-Cheomtherapy cognitive impairment\" on line.",
