      "Content": "Teach 76-  I cannot speak to radiation necrosis as I am only currently having radiation, but I can speak to professional stress related to teaching.  I love working with students, but there is quite a bit of stress related to some of the other aspects of our job.  I am spending the summer having radiation and trying to figure out how I am going to address the nonessential stress that I have allowed to dominate my time.  I am also focusing on ways to take better care of myself when I am working (i.e. asking my doctor to write a letter requesting access to a refridgerator, bathroom breaks, uninterupted lunch breaks etc.)  I cannot tell you how often I leave work and realize that I didn't get lunch becaue I was at a meeting, didn't drink water because I had no time to visit the restroom, ate a protien bar loaded with chemicals because I have no access to a refridgerator.  I love teaching, but I also have to take care of my body better than that now, and I am going home after an eight hour day next year, not twelve. Sparkle1-I am currently receiving radiation on the left side.  My RO planned my treatment around my anatomy as I hold my breath, this moves my heart out of the radiation field.  The machine only turns on as I hold my breath.  I am sure that radiation is faster and easier without the breath holding, but the protection that is provided for my heart makes it worth it.",

      "Content": "Hopeful-I just finished radiation on my left side two weeks ago, and also did the breath holding to protect my heart.  My nutritionist recommended basically a plant based diet with at least three servings of protein at each meal. She did say that meat three times a week was okay, although red meat was not not recommended for me at all.  Her focus is on plant based protien like lentils and beans and  lean meat like chicken and fish.   I was also told that regular exercise would help with fatigue throughout radiation and after.  My Nutritionist recommended at least thirty minutes a day of exercise.  The goal is to work up to an hour a day as the fatigue passes. Also, Calendula is amazing and helped with my skin so much throughout the process.   Please let me know if there is any information that I can provide!  Best of luck to you!",
