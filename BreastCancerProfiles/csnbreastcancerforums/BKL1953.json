    "Content": "I am so glad to find this forum. I finished my 6th chemo treatment for recurrent triple negative breast cancer on August 2nd.  The pain started about a month after my last treatment and has continued to get worse and is now extreme.  I thought having beat breast cancer a 2nd time and making it through chemo yet again, I could regain strength and find a \"new normal \" and get on with life.  I'm determined to do just that so ANY suggestions on how to \"fix\" the pain would be welcomed.",
