      "Content": "In 2000 I was told that I had pre breast cancer and I had 2 lumpectomys and was on Tamoxifin for 5 years, I always said that if I ever found out that I had cancer that they could take them off, and in spite of it all this Feb. they found cancer in my right breast and had a bilateral because the Dr's all said it wasn't a matter of \"if it shows up in the left, it is when\" the pre cancer was in the left so I made that decision to have them both removed. The greatest saying I have ever seen is \" Yea they are FAKE my real ones tried to kill me\" I really feel that way and I am alive and doing well. It is a personal choice. I wish I had really looked at pics before I had reconstruction because I was a little upset after surgery only until it was explained that I lost projection but I am still the same size around as I was before however it does look different. I am happy that I am alive and I think of it as a small price to pay for life! I wouldn't look at it at first and my husband kept telling me it doesnt look as bad as I thought,he is my rock and gives me strenth. I wish you luck with whatever choice you make. Hugs:) Robbin",

I know this is rambling on but I feel your pain. God Bless you and Bodhi Hugs :) Robbin",

For me the surgery wasn't the worst it was looking at it afterward which wasn't as bad as I thought it would be but the things that we can think up of in our minds are the worst...why do we listen to ourselfs? I went thru all of my diagnosis,surgery and treatment 1700 miles from all my family and friends and that was really the very worst for me, I just wanted my kids close to me but my husband was great! Good luck to you and I will be saying prayers for you. Hugs:) Robbin",
