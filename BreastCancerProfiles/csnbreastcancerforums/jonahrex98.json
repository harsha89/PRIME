    "Content": "I have been a survivor for ten years and have gotten minimal support from my husband who is a jerk too. He will never understand, nor will my children, ages 16 and 14. My main problem is the chemobrain and the chemo-induced peripheral neuropathy now. He was supportive at the time of my cancer, but not now. He and my children just think I'm a blubbering idiot who can't walk without stumbling. It seems like I'm always the brunt of their jokes. I laugh, but it really hurts my feelings. No one believes that my symptoms are all chemo-related. Maybe research on this will be much more advanced by the time you become a ten-year survivor. Don't mean to be discouraging, but it seems like no one understands but your fellow survivors. You do what you need to do.",
