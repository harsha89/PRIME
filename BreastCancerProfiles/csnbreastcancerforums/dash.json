    "Content": "I check this site almost daily and I can't tell you how much support and strenth you have all given me. I never joined a support group and in a sense, you are my support group from afar. It is nice to hear from people my own age (43). Well, today is my last chemo (8 treatments total). I must admit I am estactic yet a little frightened. As long as I have been on chemo, I felt as if I was in the \"safe\" zone. Now that I will be done, the fear of the cancer returning is in the back of my mind. I've got so many goals I want to reach, No. 1 getting my life back, growing hair everywhere!!!, lose some weight and being a wife again. Most importantly, stay focused and positive. I thank you all for being there and I will still check the site, maybe not daily, but most likely weekly. Feel free to e-mail me at dash1030@hotmail.com anytime. I'd love to hear from any of you. I am grateful to you all. God bless, Deb",
