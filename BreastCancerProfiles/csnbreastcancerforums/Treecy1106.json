      "Content": "Hi Doodle... You are soooo not alone. First and foremost we are all here and willing to help you through this. You will be ok. I know how that sounds but I remember being exactly where you are now. My mind could not accept what was going on when I got diagnosed. I had about 6 surgeries. I had a bi-lateral as well. I had dose dense chemo AC/T I did not have rads. When I lost my hair I thought to myself....WTF!!!???!!!! I was so crazy upset.  SOmeone told me to love my cancer. I thought she was nuts but it makes sense. If you love something it cant hurt you. WHen I started to do that...I started researching how to build my immune system with vitamins and healthy foods. I started to study.....that helped me so much. Instead of focusing on death and dying I focused on the here and now and not the what if's! Get youself knowledgeable about your body and increase your immune system. Look for cancer fighting foods. By doing this you stay focused on the positive. You are not alone and if you need to talk I will forward my number. :) Patrice",

      "Content": "I will tell you after I was diagnosed with BC I refused any Pet/CT scans.  I had a mammo and ultrasound and neither one showed my cancer. I found it the day after those tests and my Dr said I was fine. After he took a fine needle biopsy I had an MRI with contrast which showed 4 tumors in my left Breast. I had very dense breasts so I opted for a BMX and they found more cancer in the right breast and that didnt show up on the MRI. Anyway, wth all of those tests and a chest xray I felt my body did not need anymore radiation. That was personal choice and I felt secure with that decision.  Enough is enough with all these unnecessary tests. I did not have cancer in the lymph nodes and I spoke to my Dr's about my decision and they agreed. You need to know your body!!!! I based my decision also on bloodwork too. Good Luck with your decision! Patrice",

      "Content": "Hello Everyone, March 3rd, 2013 is Triple Negative Breast Cancer awareness day!!! Please tell your Triple Negative BC Story here and maybe we can get this page out to other sites to build awareness!!!   My name is Patrice Sarnatora and I myself was diagnosed in March of 2011 stage 2A IDC. I had 3 months of dose dense chemo. A/C/T My side effects were minimal although my white blood cell count went down to frightening levels. I had a bilateral mastectomy and very happy I did. Triple Negative is a very scarey diagnosis but with diet, yoga, massage and most importantly my faith I feel very confident that I beat this beast!!!   Its been two years and my tumors markers are very low...like 11.7 so I am very happy about that. I also wrote a booklet \"What To Do When You're Diagnosed\" by Patrice Sarnatora to help other women battle this disease. You can download the PDF file for free. Excited to hear your stories good and not so good.....newbies and oldbies..... We are here to help each other!!! (((HUGS))) Patrice  ",

      "Content": "I completely understand and when I was first diagnosed my 2 tumors were sized below 2cm but by the time of my surgery they were above 2cm. With TNBC we take NO chances. It is a very aggressive form of BC. With that in mind if I were you.....I would take every precaution available.  With any form of cancer we all need ro be our best advocates and God knows I never wanted to do chemo but looking back I am sooo happy I did.  We do it to also get rid of any micro cells hanging around that could develop into another problem. When we get operated on or have a biopsy done we always run risks of spreading bad cells around. I have done so much research on this. Please take a stand of caution and go with your gut! Have faith and stay positive :)   Hugs Patrice",
