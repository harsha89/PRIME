I'm soon to be 48 years old. I now have bone mets on top of it. I agree that the literature is mostly geared towards first time cancer victims. I too find myself trying to find answers online. I also noticed a great distance in people the second time around except my family. Freinds are less supportive maybe they think the second time is a death sentance and they just dont' want to be around you. I miss the support I had last time as well. It's like when you have your second and third children, no shower, no compassion for the fact you are tired all the time. Stay positive and know that we are here for you if you need to vent or need a friend. Terry",

The fatigue and heartache will dissipate over time. Get up every day and remember you are worth it. Take it one day at a time. Get a message or pedicure to make you feel better. My goal is to make it to my sons high school graduation in june. I'm stage vi with bone mets. You have a long life ahead of you be strong and you will get through it.

I had this because my wound wasn't healing. It helps the wound heal much faster. I don't know if this would help but worth a try to ask. I think most of us can relate to your situation. Just remember that your breasts do not define who you are. It's normal to feel angry and not feel like dealing with it anymore. I think most of us can relate to that as well. We all agree that cancer S**ks. Unfortunatly a lot of people's bodies reject foreign objects. I had mesh implanted and ended up getting an infection from it which ended up with the removal of the mesh from my body. It is hard to keep it all going at times but I want you to know that acceptance is possible. I don't believe it's a message from God. I think most of us walk around with the gene and something happens that triggers it. I'm sorry you are having to go through this. I did a journal only when I was angry so I could get it all out on paper. I would also suggest a therapist or support group to help you with all of your emotions. I hope your wounds heal fast and that you are able to do your radiation soon. Please know that we are here for you. Feel free to vent anytime. ((hugs)) Terry",

I made a lot of jokes about it and still do today, but I have to say it doesn't really bother me. My chest did not define who I was as a person (38C) and still doesn't. I recently had a recurrance and had to have my sternum and parts of 4 ribs removed, now that did bother me. My chest always feels like I have a 10 pound weight on it as they had to reconstruct a chest wall for me.
