She wanted me to post and tell you all she sends her love and that she is praying for all of you. Dawne has had some relief from the lymphedema. They placed a stent in her arm and it has drained some and looks so much better. Dawne is still in a lot of pain, she has fluid in her chest area again, they could not drain it right away because she is to weak. She goes to the Dr on Monday. She is still fighting and her spirit is amazing. Her daughter is staying with them all the time and doing a wonderful job caring for her Mom. Dawnes Mom comes everyday and is there for Dawne anytime she needs her. Dawnes husband is her rock, he is incredibly supportive. Her family is a strong support system for Dawne. Thank you all for the prayers and please continue to keep Dawne in your thoughts and prayers. God Bless you all                                                     (((hugs))) Janice",

I don't want to admit to just being forgetful at times due to age so I am using chemo brain as my excuse!! I just have the aches and hot flashes etc that go along with aromasin, most of the time the SE's are not to bad. We are baking here in the central Texas area right now, as are a lot of other areas in the country. I have had trouble with my knee, after a 2nd injection of a different kind it is doing better. I still have so pain but not near as much as before so that is good. I stay busy everyday keeping up with my 5 wonderful grandbabies. I don't get on as often as I should but I think of you all often.
