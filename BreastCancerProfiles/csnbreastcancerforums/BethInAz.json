I was out for a walk yesterday and later in the evening realized I had sunburn on both arms. I'm not usually sensitive to the sun and don't usually burn so easily. Wondering if it's the tamoxifen - and, if so, why... Thanks for any knowledge y'all have! Beth",

      "Content": "Jo Jo: I gained about 9 pounds on tamoxifen - my GP said that was pretty good since she's seen women put on 25 pounds! It's that whole \"being pushed into menopause\" thing that causes the weight gain, I think. I have good news, though! I'm finally being successful in getting the weight off! I went online to http://caloriecount.about.com where you can log your food, your activity, and your weight daily. My GP said to limit intake to 1200-1400 calories per day and exercise 30 minutes 6 days per week. I've been faithfully doing the calorie counting and I swim daily. I've been really excited to have lost 15 pounds since end of January! It's slow and it takes willpower but it's doable! And YOU can do it! B.",

We are still digging out from the 51 inches we received in the White Mountains of Arizona (Pinetop-Lakeside) a couple of weeks ago so we can relate! We used to live in Exton many years ago so we know this kind of weather is unbelieveable for you. I actually enjoyed our snow. I'd just had a chemo treatment the day before and had every excuse in the book to just sit and do puzzles and read. We were without electric for about 10 hours and made it quite an adventure. We're hearing that your weather should be clearing out today. Hope you withstand! Beth",

      "Content": "Christine, I consider October 14 2009 the beginning of my breast cancer survivor timeline. It's when I had my bilateral mastectomy. The decision was easy for me as my type of cancer hid from radiology and was only found by biopsy. By the time I got to surgery, my tumor was 2.5 cm in diameter and it was miraculous that my lymph nodes were clean. I opted to have the other breast removed as well because I didn't want to always be waiting for the other shoe to drop. I've had no shooting pains and slowly I've gotten a lot of the feeling back in my chest. Initially I had phantom pain (similar to what an amputee experiences at the loss of a body part). It felt to me like I was nursing again and my milk was always coming in. Over time that has gone away and I only experience it occasionally. I often would place my hands in front of me like a scale and weigh my options - breast conservation in one hand and life conservation in the other. Deciding that I wanted to be around for my husband and daughters and live to see the birth of grandchildren made the choice an easy one. There were moments of grieving the loss but you just cry a little bit, dry your eyes, and go on with your wonderfully healthy life! Goodbye Cancer! Hello Life! Each day then becomes a gift, wrapped up with a beautiful bow. Life takes on new meaning and nothing is ever the same again. It's been a journey of joy and goodness. I will pray for you specifically as you face your surgery on the 12th. (I'm halfway through my chemo now and sometimes lie awake at night. That's the time I pray for everybody on my list. You'll now be on that list.) Blessings! Beth",

      "Content": "You're very welcome, new friend. I'm so glad you were blessed by my words. Question for you - what form did your local recurrence take? Since radiation isn't necessarily indicated for mastectomy, I assumed that the chemo would knock out anything at the surgery site. I do know that mastectomy isn't the \"silver bullet\" and we still have to be vigilant. I'm just curious as to whether a local recurrence would show up as another lump or a change in the skin. I suppose it looks like the old breast exam. Get to know your body and be alert to any changes at all? Thanks for sharing your experience! Beth",

Our weak human flesh wants to be deceived into thinking things are fearful and without hope at times but you're right in saying that those negative thoughts need to be told to FLEE in the name of our victorious Jesus. He has so much yet in store for us to do on this earth and we will continue to live for as many days as are appointed for each one of us. And then! We'll be totally healed in heaven - with glorified bodies, to boot! Can you imagine? Hugs to you, Barbara. Peace to you! Beth",

      "Content": "I would say that you're the patient and you have every right to have what you want to have done (you may want to check to see if your insurance would cover double mastectomy). A lot of doctors are of the opinion that breast conservation is important. I would rather have life conservation be the more important thing. My doctors all gave me the final choice after looking at my particular cancer. Chances of my cancer showing up in the other breast were fairly significant and since my tumor didn't show on mammo or ultrasound, I would have had to have yearly MRIs. When I said I was opting for the double, they all agreed that if it was their wife, that's what they'd recommend. In addition, the plastic surgeon said that his happiest ladies were those who came to him with a \"clean slate\" - no trying to match a saggy older boob with a perky new one. I found that it was better being flat than being lopsided during the healing process. This is such a personal decision - I hope that you're able to come to a resolution that you're pleased with and that your doctors concur with. Beth",
