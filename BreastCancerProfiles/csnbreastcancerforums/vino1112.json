    "Content": "It is hard to guess when you will stop worrying, but I don't really worry and it has been 3 years since my diagnosis. I have had so many bone scans, MRI's, etc. that I am sure I don't have a tumor, and I doubt that I will get one in the foreseeable future. What would make you stop worrying? Would more tests? Would a better understanding of your chances of recurrence? How about coming up with some questions like that and making an appointment with your oncologist just to ask those questions? You don't have to wait for a scheduled checkup you know. Regards, Louise",
