      "Content": "Hello, Ladies. I found out my bras don't fit quite the same after my reconstructive surgery. Long story short, I bought them at Kohl's, many of them quite a long time ago. I told them \"I had a bilateral massectomy and implants and they just don't fit. Can I get a store credit to replace them?\" I didn't have receipts for any of them and some of the tags were hard to read due to powdered bleach. I walked away with $200 for in store credit for 10 bras...not bad since I was going to have to throw them in the trash. I bought 4 nicer, new bras that fit, and I still have store credit... and they let me use a 15% off coupon. If you do have hair loss, I recommend a hat or turban instead of a wig. They might be more \"compassionate\" if you don't have hair. It worked for me :)",

      "Content": "My brother is an alcoholic and he has thankfully been sober for one year. Thru my cancer, I have been taking care of him. Enough is enough. You must take care of yourself, my friend. You have plenty of support, just from this website. Alcoholics/drug addicts are very, very selfish. Please take care of yourself. That is what is most important for YOU right now. Find support in friends and family who genuinely care about you. It will be my first anniversary of my last chemo July 1st. My hair looks good. I try to take our dog for a 30 minute walk everyday. My husband gives me anxiety, my daughter can be snotty....but it's \"Me\" time now.....and it should be \"Me\" time for you, also. Good luck, and make yourself top priority right now.",
