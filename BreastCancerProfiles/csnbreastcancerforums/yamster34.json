    "Content": "My mom is a breast cancer survivor. She had a double mastectomy without reconstruction. She was 69 years old at the time. She often talks about her breasts like she wishes she either did not have them both removed or wishes she had gotten reconstruction. I was her caregiver at the time and saw how difficult everything was on her. I am 44 years old and was diagnosed with terminal ovarian cancer that spread to my speen and liver. The doctor seemed to think I was going to die almost immediately. It was 9 month ago yesterday since I was diagnosed. I figured that if the doctor had already written me off, I would trust my life in the Lord's hands. I was on a vegan diet for a couple months. I have not had surgery, chemo, or radiation. Â I am using a lot of prayer and have hospice coming in. This may not work for everyone. Quite a few people I know said that I look much better now than I did during my diagnosis. I know I feel better than I have in a long time. I realized that doctors don't know when any of us will die for sure. Don't be too concerned with the statistics you read or what doctors tell you as they don't tend to tell the complete story.",
