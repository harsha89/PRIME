    "Content": "I understand how you feel. I am new to this website. I was diagnosed with breast cancer in April. My husband is self-employed and leaves all bills and other important paperwork to me. He still expects me to handle all the bills, etc... and somehow I have managed to keep things paid. My daughter and I are staying 150 miles away with my family during my surgeries and treatment. He still expects me to come home every week or two to pay bills and do the business books. I don't know how much more I can take. I am stressed to the limit, but he won't even listen to me when I tell him I am a nervous wreck. So, for my daughter's sake I try to take care of her, him and myself. I don't like the way I look without hair. But, my daughter has been my constant encouragement. When she sees me look at myself in the mirror, she hugs me and tells me she loves me. Hope you can find someone you will give you love and support. I certainly could use some more love and support myself. Hold on, be good to yourself.",
