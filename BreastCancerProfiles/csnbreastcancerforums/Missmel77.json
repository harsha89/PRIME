    "Content": "Has anyone ever heard of Hospice coming in to help someone with pain management if there was no indication there is limited time left for that person? My mom has Breast Cancer that has spread to the bone, and has determined to not pursue anymore medical treatments- just to live out the rest of her life. Her doctor suggested that Hospice come in and help her gain some strength to be able to do the necesary paperwork to prepare for the inevitable. They kept assuring her that it was not for the \"end of her life\" but to strengthen her. Is there any truth to that? Any ideas or experience with Hospice that can shed some light on the situation?
