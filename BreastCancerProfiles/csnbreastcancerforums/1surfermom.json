I used to feel that I always had to stay positive and not complain and I would feel guilty if I didn't quite feel up to doing my normal activities i.e cooking for my family, taking my children to school, attending their sporting events. I have been on chemo since March 4, 2009 and will end chemo on 9-2-2009(God willing). I finally came to the point of breaking and told my family and friends that I have a right to feel depressed and and I have a right to put my self first for once in my life. I agree with Mimi send your nieces a facebook message. I have a niece who I text often it seems that telephone conversations are a thing of the past. Also do you belong to a church or have a service group like the Boy Scouts in your area. Perhaps they could help with the maintenance of your home. I wish you lived close to me as my oldest son (15 years) is required to do service hours for our church. I know that some of his friends that are scouts are often in need of projects for their Eagle Scout. Just a thought. Take good care of your self. Love Surf",

For me the anxiety of loosing it was worse than it falling out. Once my head was shaved I felt strangely relieved. Do you have a cancer center near your home? I was able to get a free wig and I purchased some cute headcoverings in the center's gift shop. Also look into the Look Good Feel Better program by the ACS, it is really helpful.

This board is filled with wise people who will give you some great advice throughout your whole treatment and beyond. I can only offer my experience with Chemo. On the day of my first treatment I can honestly say I had never felt so vulnerable in all of my life. It is a feeling that is hard to describe but in all honesty it was pretty awful. After the infusion I felt pretty good and almost relieved that it wasn't as bad as what I had conjured up in my head. Make sure that you hydrate, hydrate and hydrate some more. Don't be frightened when you see bright red urine ( it's just the lovely AC). Also make sure you take your medications before you feel sick, I didn't and learned the hardway.  I know it's hard but it is doable and if you need anything we are here to help. Love Surf",
