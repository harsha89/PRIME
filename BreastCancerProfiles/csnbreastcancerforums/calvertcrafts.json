      "Content": "I also debated about radiation. I went thru 7 weeks and while I hated every day of it, I never suffered severe burns, only minor skin irritation. I've spoken to several people who skipped rads and then had a recurrance. They all wondered if they had had the radition , would the recurrance have happened. I know it's a hard decision and my thoughts and prayers are with you!!",
