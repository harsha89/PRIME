      "Content": "I had my bilateral mastectomy 12/15. I saw the plastic surgeon early 12/19 because I was concerned about the tremendous swelling. Anyway, he voiced concern about how I was healing and explained all about having to have dead tissue removed. He said it was too early to tell how much of the tissue had died but, would be able to tell more this coming wednesday. He said it was a realitively common complication---blood flow to the skin is interrupted when the breast tissue is removed--sometimes there isn't enough blood supply left to support the remaining skin tissue. He did warn me about it pre-op. He said the damage is done during the actual mastectomy and there is nothing you can do about it--the damage cannot be reversed. Per the MD the amount of skin involved determines what kind of \"clean-up\" follows. It could be just a little trimming in the office, a little procedure in the OR or a latissimus flap reconstruction. The last one is pretty scary---I hope and pray it is not in the cards for either of us. It's bad enough to get diagnosed with cancer, then have a double mastectomy and THEN have to worry about MORE surgery. I wish you the best of luck for speedy healing and NO MORE complications!!!!

      "Content": "I didn't have chemo so, can't address that part of your question. But, a few things have come to mind as I read your post. Did you have oncotypedx testing done? If not, ask for it to be done. At least then you can find out how much (if any) chemo could reduce your chances of a recurrance. It would certainly be easier to make an informed decision if you knew that. The other thing I thought of: if you don't connect or feel comfortable with your oncologist---get another one. Or if that isn't possible, at least get a 2nd opinion. It's your life you are making decisions about. You need to be armed with all of the known facts before you make your decision. And I can see no reason that the decision needs to be made right away. I hope you know that you don't have to feel you need to do anything I suggested. I'm just throwing out thoughts that might help you. if they do, thats great, if not, that's fine too. Hugs, El",

      "Content": "Hi Shortcakes, I'm so sorry life keep hitting you with more challenges. Please ask your Dr for something to help you. Your cancer battle is enough to have to deal with. Add on losing your mom and your dad's illness----of course you are crying. Sadness (and a lot of other emotions) is perfectly normal given all you are going through. But, I think you need something if you start and end each day crying. Can you bring yourself to respond honestly about how you are doing when someone asks? Not everyone who asks---just one person you feel is safe and supportive. I think you would benefit from crying with someones arms holding you. You know we all send you our cyber shoulders to cry on, hugs, love and support. I so badly want to give you a real hug---I can't so I'm asking you to find one person who will. You and yours are in my prayers. Hugs, El",

      "Content": "I had my expanders placed at the same time as the mastectomies so, it's hard to know which pain was caused by what. But, my expanders went way under my arms and that area was really tender for over a week (closer to 2 weeks I think). The expander edges are hard and sort of folded up and they irritate most of the tissue they touch. Mine were never comfortable. They got more comfortable around the edges each time they were expanded. Now they also felt tighter each time they were expanded. The expander has a port on the front that the plastic surgeon locates with a magnet. He then injects a big syringe of saline. So many nerves were cut with the mastectomy that it really doesn't hurt, sometimes you hardly feel the injection. As the expander gets bigger the muscles and skin get stretched so, it feels tight for a few days. I would usually take a pain pill for a night or 2 after the expansion to help me get comfortable enough to sleep. So, it's not fun but, it's do-able. And you will be so pleased once it is replaced with the implant. Hope this helps. And i hope you feel more comfortable soon. Hugs, El",

      "Content": "Heidi, I agree with the others. Get all of the information to understand why the surgeon wants to do the mastectomy. Tell him/her your fears. Ask if you have to make a decision quickly or if it's OK to take some time. Have someone go with you to take notes and help you ask everything you need to. Or take a list and tape recorder. We always get more information than we can absorb. Get a second opinion if you have any doubts. It is your breast and ultimately your decision whether it stays or goes. So, make an informed decision that you can live comfortably with. Nothing about this nasty disease is easy--even if everything goes according to plan. I've learned that when they go through that list of possible complications that I might actually have some of them. I am so sorry your battle hasn't gone as smoothly as you (and we) would hope. Lots of positive thoughts coming your way! Hugs, El",

      "Content": "Tamoxifen is an estrogen blocker, so if your bc is not responsive to estrogen there is no reason to block it. I guess 5% is close enough to zero to be considered not responsive. I was super positive (95% and 99%). My oncologist said because I had noninvasive DCIS and bilat. mastectomy that I didn't need to take Tamoxifen. I'm not sure I understand that. My sister had the same and was put on tamoxifen (but it was her 2nd mastectomy for DCIS). Very confusing stuff! Wishing you answers and peace. El",
