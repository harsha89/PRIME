    "Content": "I'm from Oz. I'm eligable for free Herceptin treatment. This is indeed the lucky country. My doc advised me to take herceptin for a whole year, every 3 weeks. After 5 doses, I developed heart failure( detected via regular gated heart pool scans). This really worried me... both heart failure and exposure to the risk that my cancer could return. I was advised to wait a few months, take heart meds, then return to Herceptin again. She also comforted me with advice that there was a study in Finland which indicated that Herceptin could be effective, if taken with Taxol at the same time after 5 rounds. Apparently there is still debate about exactly how many rounds are necessary. Anyway, I'm now taking heart tablets ( ace inhibitor and a beta blocker) and I'm coping much better with treatmens. I've got energy. I'm not breathless. I'm back to swimming laps at the poolwithout worrying. I've only got a few more to go... due to finish in time for Easter. Hercptin can be a really nasty drug.... so be careful! Having said all that I fel so fortunate that we are lucky to have targetted therapies to help with HER2 + cancers. Cheers adn best wishes.",
