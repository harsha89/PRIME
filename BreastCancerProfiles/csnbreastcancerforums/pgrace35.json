      "Content": "I pray that doesn't happen. It's discouraging enough when you get another notice that you insurance is going up again, for the 3rd time in one year. I don't know how much longer I will be able to afford it. Putting a cap on it would just be down right unfair, I've paid into health insurance my whole life, this is the first claim I have had. Some of these politicans have to have someone in their lives stricken with disease. Is there any petition out there we get on? Let us know, thanks for the info.",

      "Content": "I passed the finish line from my breast cancer treatment. Tomorrow I go to a benefit for a dear friend whom has battled this awful disease 3 times now, it's been going on for 10 yrs. This last spell is stage 4 and has spread to many parts of her body. She was a huge support to me while I was going through my treatment not knowing that she would be doing this again herself. I need your prayers, it's not looking to good and my heart is broken for her. Her spirit is huge, but her body is ailing and I have to do all I can to be strong for her and hold back the tears.",
