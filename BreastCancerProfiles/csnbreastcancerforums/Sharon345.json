      "Content": "I'm also still red and swollen after radiation. My last treatment was in May of this year. I didn't have chemo. I'm a 38D but no doctors have blamed it on that. I'm very fair and the radiation oncol did blame it on that. He said it might take a year to clear up, my surgeon said it might take 3 years. I am wearing regular bras to work but take it off as soon as I get home. What I need is a 2-size bra. A larger one for the bad breast and my old size for the good breast! If I get one to fit the bad breast then it has too much material for the good one and doesn't look good with knit tops. Oh well, after reading many of these ladies stories my problem is just a drop in the bucket in comparison.",
