Invasive Ductual Carcinoma in 2008 treated by a double mastectomy. No radiation because of previous treatment. Stopped tamoxifen after 2 mos because of gyno issues. Anyone else living w/this diagnosis and no treatment for stage 1 breast cancer after Hodgkins?",

Like you, I had my mastectomy 2 yrs ago for stage 1 w/no chemo or rads (not an option, previous rads for Hodgkins Lymphoma)and no tamoxifen(problem w/that too). I hope you don't mind me asking you, what were your symptoms for this reoccurrence? I'm wishing you the best, Cathy",

      "Content": "Hi Maelex, I am a 2 time Hodgkin's Disease Survivor (1989 & 1994) who was dx'd with breast cancer (2007) from my Hodgkin's Radiation tx's.  I am a member of a Long Term Survivors List Serv who have many complications from their treatments.  The majority of us seem to be HD survivors but many other survivors share their struggles.  Many HD's survivors have damage from radiation and Adriamycin showing up years later after treatments.  It manifests as valve problems, stenosis and/or cardiomyopathy.  I have stable valve leakages and a \"blunting of the normal augmentation\" of my heart (heart has a hard time recoverying from strenuous exercise). I am followed closely. What has helped my fellow survivors in your current situation is to seek out a cardiologist who has treated survivors who had rads and chemo.  I wish you the best as you face this new challenge. Cathy  ",
