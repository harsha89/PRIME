      "Content": "I didn't even have chemo and I suffered with fatigue for a year. Two surgeries and a prolonged healing process as well as the emotional turmoil of having cancer and then the effects of Arimidex. boy it was tough. But it's now been a year and 2 months and my wound is healed and I feel great. Give yourself a break, you deserve it. Antidepressants might also be another good idea. I take Zoloft, but did prior to diagnosis as well, just increased the dose. Good Luck Love, Beth",

I am on Arimidex and have hot flashes a lot during the day. Especially in this summer heat but.....Getting hot flashes is tolerable compared to living with the increased risk of the cancer comming back. I say try you may be pleasantly suprised. Good Luck!

      "Content": "Jean, be kinder to yourself. Why didn't the doctors ask if you had any bone pain? With positive Her2 you would think they would do a full assessment. I blame doctors seeing too many patients per day. And we all know this is because of the costs of running a practice grows by leaps and bounds each year. With new and increasingly burdensom regulations and liability coverage and all.......I don't know the solution. I am a nurse and I would not have asked for the bone scan at diagnosis or at the end of therapy. God, I had never heard of HER2 until I got to this site. No one even mentioned my status. So I got a copy of my pathology to assure it had been tested and the results had been negative. Thank God they were. God Bless You, Beth",

      "Content": "Interesting. Scarr tissue continues to form over time in some people even after the insult is gone (radiation). Or it may be a combination of the scarr tissue and a small blockage and now is noticable. Radiation can do very strange things around the site effected. Looking at these effects just shows how different we all are. Good Luck! Hope the test comes out great but if surgery is required, it is now much less invasive and with very high precentages of possitive outcomes. Easy to say when it isn't my neck!. Beth",
