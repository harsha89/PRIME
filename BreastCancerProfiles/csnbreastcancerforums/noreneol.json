    "Content": "Hi.I just turned 38.Lately I have been having breast pain ,breast tenderness,loss of weight,enlarged veins under the arm on the same side,the breast looks slightly larger than the other,and a red dot has appeared next to the nipple.I went to the doctor but she didn't feel anything,but am having mammogram and physical next week.They already did an ultrasound,I thought I saw a white clump of white stuff on the u/s,I was watching them perform it.They had it in a box and I think printed it out.I'm getting results of that next week also.I'm scared.Has anyone else gone through this too? What are the chances it's cancer? I lost 4 pomds since last thursday and I eat McDonald's food! so why am I losing weight? Also have a bad wisdom tooth on that side getting pulled out ASAP,could the tooth be doing all this? I have pain in my shoulder,arm,and the side of my neck,too.HELP! OPINIONS please...Has anyone else gone thru this,like the ultrasound? I need answers! Thanx. N.Y.",
