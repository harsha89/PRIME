    "Content": "Has anyone tried to get life insurance after having Breast Cancer? It is open enrollment time for benefits at my work and options for Life Insurance are offered. Because my company is changing insurers, for this year only, a set amount of life insurance is guranteed without a medical history being required. If you want additional coverage a medical history form needs to be completed and policy approved. I was wondering if anyone on this board has tried to get Life Insurance and what the outcome of the approval process was. I am planning on going with the guaranteed amount and not tempt fate, but it made me wonder. My husband also was diagnosed with early stage Prostate cancer this year so we are in the same boat with him.",
