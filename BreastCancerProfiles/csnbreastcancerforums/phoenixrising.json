But I did get it for my mother-in-law when she had b.c. mets and the morphine was making her too constipated. What I did was make a very, very strong tea and she took about a shot glass of it now and then. She didn't get high and it did help her pain very much. Legal?? I didn't care. If it was going to help her then it would be done. Not the same as the medical mj but some info for you all the same. Best of luck to you.",

I didn't get any mouth sores until I had the taxotere and then I got them really bad. Don't know if everyone does though. There are mouth rinses that give almost immediate relief. Ask about using ice chips to help prevent them. They may not completely prevent them but they can make a real difference. This was suggested to my husband when he had 5FU for colorectal cancer and I used them also for 5FU. Don't know why they didn't suggest it for the taxotere though. Best of luck to you...hope it's a smooth ride :) jan",

I have it in the breast I have left and it's not cancer. My doc also said she had it in her breasts, but it's not cancer. If it was they'd start talking to you about tx. So I wouldn't worry.

I don't know how long your husband has been on steroids or how long they will keep him on them, but check with your onc about supplementing with calcium as steroids prevent the absorption of this mineral. Some suggest taking Vit D3 as well. This is usually for long term steroid use. Hope you've had a wonderful day. jan",

Some people are born considerate and some learn it along the way but a great majority of people are really quite self centered and unfortunately sometimes they are our family. I do know how it can hurt. What I've been trying to do is feed that which bears fruit. No more one way street when it comes to relationships. But I can tell you that is hard to do with family cause we love them still. I hope at least one of them does something special for you soon to turn this around. hugs jan",

      "Content": "Linda Update by Lisa Martin Written 41 minutes ago Hi, this is Lisa Martin, logging in for Linda. She and I wanted to update you on what\u2019s been going on. Yesterday she was admitted into the hospital after spending the night at emergency. For the past several weeks, since radiation, she has been having really bad headaches in addition to the ear infection, and has been sleeping for 20 hours a day. Her fever and chills seems to have finally subsided, but the headache and nausea is worse, and the skin blistering and swelling is also spreading over her head and face. She\u2019s getting morphine every 2 hours to help with the pain, and they have her on iv\u2019s and resting. The doctor said they think it\u2019s a reaction to the brain radiation, but they don\u2019t really know anything else. Her CAT scan showed no brain swelling and that everything seemed fine. Blood work was normal too. No MRI scheduled at this time, and the doctor feels she should be hospitalized until the severe pain is managed and the nausea is better, as there is a concern for dehydration. Karl is doing great at holding down the fort with the kids; Gabe\u2019s football team won the game on Friday night, and even though Mom & Dad were at the hospital, they are very proud of him! Karl\u2019s also been shuttling the kids around and managing everything between hospital visits, and I have a huge favor to ask. If anyone can help get a few meals over to their house to ease the pressure and make one less thing for them to worry about, that would be greatly appreciated! I\u2019m trying to do the planner on this Caringbridge website, but still trying to figure it out. Please email me at lmartin1008@gmail.com if you can help and when. I\u2019ll do a manual calendar until I can get it otherwise organized. Dinner this evening is already taken care of (Sunday night.) Thank you for your support and prayers. I am organizing another yard sale in the next couple weeks to raise some more money for her medical fund checking account to help defray the daily co-pay of the hospital and other things. If you can donate for this, please let us know; it will be at Linda\u2019s house, so drop off can be there, coordinated with Karl\u2019s and my schedule. If you need more information on the yard sale or the account, please email me as well. Lisa Martin",

Some Doctors are convinced that there IS a Cancer Personality but I think the last word in the medical journals is that there is not a Cancer Personality. I am always looking at ways cancer may be caused and find it interesting. Here are some personality traits suggested by Dr. Douglas Brodie MD on the subject. 1. Being highly conscientious, dutiful, responsible, caring, hardworking. 2. Carry burdens of others. Worry for and about others. 3. Deep seated need to make others happy. 4. History of lack of closeness with one or both parents. 5. Stuffing down toxic emotions, ie: anger, hostility, resentment and has difficulty expressing them. 6. React adversely to stress and usually experiences an especially damaging event approximately 2yrs before cancer detectable. 7. Unresolved deep seated emotional problems arising in childhood. I don't know about you gals, but I see me in a lot of this stuff I am sorry to say. And there have been quite a few damaging events in the past 10 yrs. I think I fit the profile and I believe my mother-in-law fit it too. She had breast cancer and was unable to fight it. Do you think there is something to this or is it just a bunch of hogwash. cheers jan",

      "Content": "I have a copy of a relatively new mag called \"beyond Breast Cancer\". In it are stories of women who have fought and beat (so far) breast cancer as well as practical information and advice. A couple of stories are wonderful but annoying. Did I mention I experience a cyclic mood disorder since taking docetaxal?? I only mention this in case you think I'm cranky:) Story #1 is called \"Create your own Destiny\" and is about a woman who 23yrs ago \"declared war on Breast Cancer\". As well as breast cancer she had 8 years of chemo for ovarian cancer, 12 different types of chemo and 16 operations. A woman who has certainly paid her dues. What bugs me is the phrase \"declare war on cancer\" because it insinuates there is something specific you can do to destroy it and there isn't. We can have our surgery, take our chemo, radiation and hormone pills and it's still a crap shoot although a better one than not doing them. And you never really know if you've gotten rid of it or not. I can declare war on high blood pressure because there are specific things I can do to lower it. We usually know the cause or contributing factors. I can declare war on a number of illnesses but not this. Because even if I do say the words and get pumped about it, I'm still just standing here wondering what exactly to do that I wasn't doing before. With no known risk factors to fall back on (and 80% don't) how do you choose your weapon? (I'm the only one on both sides of my family who has gotten any type of cancer) What about those who have given the battle cry and with steely determination have declared war on the beast. Did everything, food, exercise, positive attitude...etc and found the beast had won. How would she feel if someone told her to \"create her own destiny\" after all the work she had done and all she went through. Would she feel she failed or is less of a warrior? I would hope not. With all that fight not having worked what is there left to do? I guess this is where \"God\"s will\" and \"meant to be\" come into play. Then what happened to the \"create your own destiny\"? I think we are always creating our own destiny we just don't know exactly how we're doing it Story#2 is called \"Climbing through Breast Cancer\" where a woman who is a professional rock climber developed breast cancer at 33. An incredibly fit lady she chose to have a bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction. She regains her precancerous fitness level and continues to ice climb, ski, scuba dive,....etc. What puzzles me is at the end of the article she claims that beating cancer was her greatest accomplishment. Unless assuming that every day we are not diagnosed with it is a day we have beat it, I don't know how she conquered it. And since it can rear its ugly head at any point in time no one knows if it is truly conquered. It is just my take that while a lot of stories are meant to give hope and encouragement, it seems that depending on where you stand they can make you feel even more isolated and alone than you were before. Am I just being cranky or do I have a point? Thanks for listening jan",

But still there is no one like yourself. I hope things turn around for you and you get the tx you deserve. hugs jan",

I think you have a better chance of them hiring you knowing the details rather than just looking at a report that says you have bad credit. Besides it will also put a more personal touch to your interview and who knows, they may just might admire your strength, dedication and perseverance and hire you because of that. Best wishes to you Cindy I really hope you get the lab job. jan",

You are not seeing yourself correctly nor giving yourself the love and compassion that you so often offer others. After what you've been through why should you have to live up to standards that you don't expect others to do?? Having said that I know what you mean cause I do the same, but it's wrong!!! Step outside yourself and look at yourself as you would anyone having gone through this experience and then tell us what you see. A beautiful, intelligent women who's just had her a*ss kicked by a life threatening disease who wonders why she can't be perfect when she's just barely out of tx. Going through chemopause (which is enough of a challenge for those of us who did it naturally). Hmmmmmmmmmm!!!! Lets think about this. I fully know what you're talking about but I'm NOT going to let you stay there :) Big Hugs jan",
