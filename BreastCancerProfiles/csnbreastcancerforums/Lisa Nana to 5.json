      "Content": "welcome Beepositive. I hate that you have to be here, but glad to \"meet ya\". lol I have IDC as of August 9, 2016. This was a recurrence after DCIS in 2008 with bilateral mastectomy and latissimus flap reconstruction. I am on letrozole since late August with some minor SE. Mainly some muscle and joint pain and LOTS of hot flashes. A little trouble sleeping. Stay positive and ask any question you have. There is almost always someone who can identify with almost any situation. ",

      "Content": "well, I'm not the average BMX patient. I had DCIS in 2008 and decided after much thought, research and prayer to do the bilateral. I lost my mom to BC when she was only 38 so the decision to take them both off was really a foregone conclusion. I had expanders in at mastectomy. My body rejected one after 1 month and then the other in 2 months. Finally, 4 months after mastectomies, I had latissimus flap reconstruction with cohesive gel implants under muscle. The recovery process wasn't as bad as I had imagined. I slept in a recliner with a pillow behind my low back for a couple weeks since I couldnt lay on either side or belly and I'm just not a back sleeper. Now, Fast forward...... I was cancer free for 8 years, but unfortunately just this month have been diagnosed with IDC in the same breast that started all this mess in the first place. I say all this not to scare or discourage anyone, but to say to be sure to continue to do self exams and push for some type of imaging if possible. I was told there weren't any needed. I've read on here, though that some women get MRIs every few years.  I was told I had a less than 2% chance of recurrence but here I go again. I would still do it all again, but I'm just saying examine regularly and report any little thing that seems unusual. Better safe than sorry. ",
