    "Content": "Hi everyone. I am starting 5 - 6 months of chemo in 2 weeks and it is the type that makes your hair fall out.  In preparation, I have already had my hair cut from shoulder length to smile length, just to get used to short hair. I am thinking I may go to a pixie cut before I do the big shave.  I want to go online and order a few things (scarves. hats, etc)  for the big shave day and for the months to come with no hair.  There are so many options. I really don't know what to order. Later, I will go wig shopping in person but I love to know what your go-to items were other than wigs.  I'd love to know if you were fond of a particular hat or scarf (or type of hat or scarf). Did you find headbands useful and if so, did you order special ones or just use the kind you can find in drugstores. Did you buy night caps?  I so appreciate all your help and advice!        ",
