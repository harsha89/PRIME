      "Content": "My oncologist also explained very simplistically, the effect of anti-oxidants in chemo and suggested not over-consume them. He told me just to keep balanced diet. I do take a cup of green tea since all this started, but that is to avoid taking coffee. I understand that in general we should avoid caffeine, so if you drink green tea, make sure it is decaf. One supplement I took during chemo was Milk Thistle. My oncologist didn\u2019t prevent me from taking them, but he didn\u2019t believe there were any benefits from it either. This supplement promotes healthy liver function, so I thought it would be a good help for liver during chemo. This supplement is also known to help reduce hot flushes, which we can also get from some chemos. There are no scientific studies proving the benefits for taking this, so it is only a matter of having faith..! Remember that this is a relatively cheap supplement (not profitable for pharmaceuticals) and therefore not officially promoted, so as long as there is no proof of it beeing bad, I am up for it!",
