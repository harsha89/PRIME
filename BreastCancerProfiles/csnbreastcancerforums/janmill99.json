    "Content": "You have not said why you don't want to take Femara so it's difficult to know how to address your question. I have been taking it for over 5 years and given that I was Stg.IIIb I credit Femara with being alive. I have joint pain, BUT I'm still here with no recurrence. That seems like a wonderful trade off to me. I wish you well in your decison making. Give it some time, you can always decide later.",
