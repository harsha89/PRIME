      "Content": "Hi Ellison, Bone pain can be quite hard to endure. I just had surgery for a broken neck due to my breast cancer mets to my spine and am in a halo brace. THings have been pretty rough lately for me as well. I have been battling breast cancer off andon for the last 3 1/2 years, since I was 24. You are right in sticking up for yourself. My radiation doctor sent me home when I told him how bad my recent neck pain was...before my surgery...luckily I called my oncologist, got in right away, was admitted tothe hospital for pain control and the source of the problem was found within hours. I am lucky I can walk and was not paralyzed from the neck down. Keep your chin up, you will be amazed what you really can endure when you are faced with it. Carrie",

      "Content": "I couldn't agree with you more. I did find a program called AVON Cares. It is sponsored by an organization called Cancer Care. I qualified for a one time $250 grant from them to help with such expenses. Child Care is a problem for women undergoing chemo. The grant was great,but only goes so far. The town I live in did an article on me for breast cancer awareness and it ended up being a great thing. One man from my community started a fund raiser to help our family pay for things such as child care. I hope this info has helped you in some way.",

      "Content": "I had a port put in back in May and I love it. It is such a great thing to have. I get my chemo through it and also my blood draws. It was one of the best things that I ever did. For me, I had a hard time in surgery, I had to have general anesthesia for an outpatient procedure. My surgeon still gives me a hard time about it. :) Appartently I didn't sedate very well. I get a good laugh out of it now. Everything will go well for you and you will love it. When do you start your chemo? ONe thing to know, if you really don't care for needle pokes to ask for a scrip called Emla cream. It will numb your skin and you won't feel them access your port. HOpe you are doing well! Take care!
