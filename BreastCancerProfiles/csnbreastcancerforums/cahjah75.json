I had clean margins and no lymph node involvement. I had the BRCA gene test done and I was negative. Yet, the oncologist told me my chance of recurrence was 20% and that is too high in my book. I start chemo Aug 10 and if later I'm told I need rads I'll do that too. I'm 61 and plan on living as long as I can for my grandchildren ages 0-6. Good luck with your decision. Char",

Insurance covered most of the cost. Hope you discomfort eases up soon. I did not have any lymph node involvement so the only thing I had to deal with was the drains for 10 days and then healing (I had about 75 steri strips). {{hugs}} Char",

My surgeon said it would have been disfiguring to say the least. I also had LCIS in the left breast and decided I wasn't going to wait around to go through 2 mastectomies. I opted for bilateral mastectomy and have not regretted it. I'm the 5th in my family with bc. My grandmother died after it metastized to her bones. That was 56 years ago. My aunt who is 90 now had a mastectomy at age 68 and is doing well. I have 2 sisters who are bc survivors although neither of them need mastectomy. I tested negative for the BRCA genes. At 61 I've decided not to have reconstruction. I purchased my \"new girls\" and insurance paid for them. I did meet with a ps prior to surgery and he told me I could have reconstruction many years later if I ever decided it was what I wanted. I think I'll be happy with what I have rather that go through more surgery. I had chemo #4 of 6 yesterday. It is all doable. I know this is a lot to take in. Believe in yourself and your drs and some day you'll know what you went through was worth it. {{hugs}} Char",

I'm so glad you posted about feeling yucky as you were getting chemo and that you felt worse the next 2 days instead of 3 days later. I'm getting very anxious as my 1st chemo is tomorrow. I took Dex this morning and will take it with dinner. Tomorrow before chemo I'll take Emend. I discovered a dilemma today. After bilateral mastectomy I bought a prosthetic camisole w/cotton boobs. Well it covers my Purple Power Port so I called the onco nurse and asked about it. She suggested I wear a button down shirt that can be undone to access port then I'll cover up. I have black sutures where the incision is and I'm swollen and bruised. So, the onco nurse called in Emla cream for me to use. Such nuisances are a real pain in the butt!

The side effects I do have are bloating accompanied with weight gain and acne on my face and bald head. I also use plastic silverware. I also get the Neulasta shot the day after chemo. The bone aches start about 3 days later but are controlled with extra strength Tylenol. As someone mentioned when the onco nurses start they watch very carefully for any adverse side effects.
