    "Content": "did you have Radiation? I have a left side implant and need to begin my radiation - doctors had said it was safe to have the surgery before but now i'm hearing horror stories about the radiation thining out the skin so that it no longer holds the implant - causing you to need more surgery. having the expander in for 6 mos, for me, was difficult, but now think that was because of the lymphnode surgery. And it is pretty amazing that there can be a \"breast\" again. good luck! it certainly is a journey! Sue KÂ ",
