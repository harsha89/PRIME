    "Content": "Hi everyone, I'm new here and have a question about purchasing a camisole. I had my surgery (left breast mastectomy and lymph nodes) 3 weeks ago and have been trying to research the camisoles and the best place to buy them. Does insurance cover them, and if so, do I need a prescription from the doctor? I am experiencing more discomfort the last few days under my arm (and rest of surgical site) and wondering if getting one would aggravate it. I got a few hospital gowns when I came home and have been living in them at home. Even wearing them for visits to the doctor which cuts down on my changing into one of their gowns. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Maddie",
