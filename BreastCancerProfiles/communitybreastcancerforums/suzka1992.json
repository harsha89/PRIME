    "Content": "Aug 6, 2016 10:08AM - edited Aug 6, 2016 10:09AM by suzka1992 I am interested to know if anyone has this issue too. I had a lumpectomy last year, June 2015 followed by 3 months of radiation. I started Tamoxifen last October. I had a follow up mammogram and ultrasound in April 2016, which was clean. I had a follow up appt. with my surgeon in June 2016 and she said I'm doing great. I don't have to see her for a year and I don't need a mammo/us until next year too. I have had no real pain until recently. My tumor was on the right side of the breast (cleavage side) and I have a titanium clip on the other side (arm side). I did have a node biopsy in my armpit with no nodes removed. I am now having pain in my rib under the armpit and some soft tissue pain. I don't feel any swelling or see any bruising. I am scheduled to see my oncologist in a few weeks and she always does a breast exam. I don't know if I should call my surgeon before the appointment? I'm freaking out a little...",
