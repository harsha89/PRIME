MTwoman, what you have said makes perfect sense, yes I do have a copy of the pathology report, it makes no mention of what the spiculated mass is, what it says is as follows \"stereotactic core needle biopsy, right breast, fibrocystic changes with ductal calcifications no maligancy seen. They did put a clip in where they took the biopsy from. I took your advise and just called the surgeons office and spoke to the nurse, apparently the doctor / radiologist expert that needs to be contacted is on vacation and will be back on Tuesday, so I guess its a waiting game again. I have also read other messages on here about the pain, and the pain i get sounds so typical of others with breast cancer, my gut feeling is that I am not going to get good news, and I am trying to prepare myself for bad news, as the clock ticks any shred of positvity is draining away. Thanks again for the reply's  Eileen x",

My life has been turned upside down recently, and I really need to vent just now. On May 22nd I had a routine mammogram, shortly after I was called back for a second one, as there were some concerns on the first one. From there I was sent to have an ultra sound done and it was found that I had some kind of spiculated mass on my right breast, ACR BI RADS Category 5: Highly suspicious for Malignancy, I was advised to have an urgent biopsy, but due to July 4th holidays I had to wait two weeks for the biopsy, the person who did the biopsy found it hard to locate the mass from the report from the mamma and the ultra sound, apparently, they felt the angle the photos were taken from the mammograms had magnified the problem, and in her opinion they had exaggerated things, even though, the ultra sound found the same issues as the mamagram place. A couple of days later my biopsy results came back all clear, and recommended that i had a mamagram six months later. Just over a week later I was back at my regular doctor as I also have blood in my urine and she said how it was good news about my biopsy results, i said i was concerned that the ultra sound and mamagram reports were so convincing that it looked like I had cancer, and how the biopsy doctor had problems locating my problem area, so she sent me for a second opinion. Two weeks later i was at the surgeons office this time, with all my cds and reports, i had looked this doctor up on line and found out he was going to be 72 years of age, but a young doctor walked in the room, he told me he was going to chat with me about my concerns and then the other doctor would come along too. Once i went through everything, he told me that Pathology would rule my out come and that the biopsy was all clear so it was good news. I was so happy to have this confirmed, but then five minutes later he came back with the older doctor who i was meant to see, the older doctor said that there has been a mistake made, and that at this stage he cant say what it was, as he is looking at my cds and reports and that it is like two different peoples results. He went on to say that if he was to believe one set of reports he should be telling me that i have Cancer, but the biopsy says not!!! He then went onto say that he was going to chat my case over with another doctor who was a breast specialist and that I may have to start from scratch for them to confirm my results, but assured me he would get to the bottom of it. He asked me to give him a week and he would get back to me. That was one week ago and I have not heard from anyone as yet. So I am now going into my 12th week of still not being diagnosed and everyday feels like a life time. I have pain in that breast which I did have before, but it feels like it has got worse, but of course that maybe all in my head. I am going crazy, and am trying to be strong and stay positive as I have four sons and a husband who are all strong men, but if i just look at them, they fall apart and i need to hold it together as i worry that if i start to cry I just may not be able to stop. Thank you for your time to read this, and good luck to each and everyone one of you xx Log in to post a reply",
