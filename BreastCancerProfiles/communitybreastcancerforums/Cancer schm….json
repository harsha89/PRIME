I'm curious about the truncal lymphedema. My pain happens whenever I change positions. It sends a shooting burning pain into my nipple. When I got off the radiation table today, it happened because I went from laying down to sitting up. When I roll over at night, the same thing happens. I noticed today that as long as I'm wearing a bra, I don't have the pain. However, I need to take the bra off to air out the boob. No win situation here.",

I haven't had any SE's yet, but I know they're coming. I have chosen to make the best of this journey by entertaining my rad techs. Every day, I put a different message on my breast or torso, on my \"good\" side. I use stickers and/or markers. If the saying needs a graphic, I grab something off of Google images and tape it on. Some examples: f cancer, cancer you're fired (with picture of Donald), Toast the Ta Ta (with picture of toaster), Does this radiation make my butt look fat?, etc. It's really fun. They are excited to see what I have each day. I live in Indiana which is a big basketball state. Most of my techs went to Indiana University. I went to the rival school, so I put some trash talk on my body when they were still in the tournament. They got me back. They said they needed to make some more markings on my body. I didn't realize what was going on, but I left with red IU stuff written all over me. They used permanent markers so it took a few days to wash away. I am drinking lots of water, getting about 70 grams of protein a day and constantly lubing the boob. So far, so good. Good luck everyone. We can do this!",

I am an event planner and spend my days working with minute details. Recently, my co-worker who sits next to me has very politely corrected some of the stuff I have been mishandling. It's embarrassing! What do you suppose it is? Are we just so distracted with the cancer? Alzheimer's runs heavily in my family, and it scares me to death to be feeling this way. On a brighter note, I just wanted to remind everyone of how fortunate we are that modern medicine can treat this beast. My aunt died from breast cancer when she was only 47. That was 45  years ago. I think about her often. I don't think they even had mammograms back then, and I'm sure the treatments were nothing like today. So while we feel bitchy, tired, itchy, sore and have that brain fog, let's all remember why we're doing this. This too shall pass and will become just a bump in the road. So let's go get zapped and be one day closer to done. Have a great evening everyone.",

I may actually make an appointment with a neurologist if this doesn't clear after radiation. After all, I won't know what to do with myself if I don't have any doctor appointments.",
