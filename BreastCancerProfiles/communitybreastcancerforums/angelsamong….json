She has been given the all clear, but now they have found a blood clot where the scar tissue is. I think this is normal, have you heard of this? I understand how it feels to wait and wait for results to come back, as she's been dealing with this for almost 2 yrs now. I guess it's just taking one day at a time, and keep breathing. Sometimes, that's all we can do, and be thankful for every breath! Take care.",
