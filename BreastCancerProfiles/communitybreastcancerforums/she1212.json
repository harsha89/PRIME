Pulled our boat to a lake a whipped my kids around tubing felt great. Loaded up on sunscreen floppy hat. My doc said keeping doing the stuff you love. Got a cold sore and I think thrush so doing salt water rinse till I get the magic stuff. I'm kind of obsessed with wigs right now. So many to choose from it's been kind of fun. Always looking for silver linings. Love more is my goal in life! Take care everyone!",

Taking my daughter back to college, going to the other's soccer games, and even just taking the smallest to school in the morning. Relying on others to run my business. I just don't know how the next phase will look like and I have to be ok with letting go of the control. Will I be sick all the time? Isolated because of risk of germs? The wig thing----im looking into getting one as well. Me bald running around with 3 kids the sad eyes and sympathy stares all the while appreciated I'm not comfortable (yet) with the attention of it all. The wig will give you some relief from stares I hope. My friends said I should get 10 cheap wigs and go from style to style and have fun with it. --she",
