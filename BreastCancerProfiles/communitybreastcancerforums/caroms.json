After an ultrasound and more focused mams they ordered a core biopsy.  I went to my gynocologist to get the results - he told me everything was fine. Today I went back for a 6month scan check up and the radiologist called me back to ask why I hadn't had a surgical biopsy. I was astounded. I said, because everythng was fine. She said my biopsy results show otherwise. Epithelial Atypia and moderate ductal hyperplasia. I am really scared and upset at my doctor. Hoping those 6 months won't make the difference for me.  My question: If any of you had similar results from a CNB, what were the results from your surgical biopsy? I of course am worried that something worse is lurking there, and plus that was six months ago. I heard that 20 - 30 percent of atypicals end up being cancer. Trying to stay calm... Thanks y'all.  Carolyn Log in to post a reply",

Yes, I do think hormones do a lot more than we think!  I have made an initial apointment with a breast cancer center to reevaluate all of my results. I wish they could just skip right to the excisional biopsy. This whole thing takes longer than one would like. I'm a rip the bandaid off person. :)  We'll see what they say on Tuesday.  Geebung- what treatment did you pursue from your DCIS? How often are you getting checked now days? Carolyn",

Last year was incredibly stressful for me. I was dx'ed with a rare brain tumor. During that time, my hormones went crazy- like pms for three months. That's when I found lumps that took me ino the doc. I wonder if my stress/ hormones prompted my breast abnormalities. All just speculation I suppose. Thankfully I was cleared of a brain tumor months afterwards after additional tests. But it's been a heck of a year. Thanks Marie, Carolyn",

It's different hearing \"don't panic\" from women who understand what it's like to be in the situation.  I am planning on going to see a surgeon soon. It takes forever to get an appointment - the waiting is hard. I just want this thing out of me!!  Part of me worries about all of the things that say that when you get BC when you're younger, it's more aggressive. Haven't been genetically tested to find out if there is a predisposition.  As far as educating myself on the diagnosis, being a Librarian, I've begun to do what I do best-- over research the heck out of it. Google Scholar and Medline are now my addictions. :) Marie - I also had this in my diagnosis as well - Pseudoangeomatous Stromal Hyperplasia. Is that the same thing as a PASH tumor?   Trying to chill out and not stress out on the Internet....  Carolyn",

It was an exhausting 11 hours spent at the center - I got more mamos, ultrasounds and an exam. Since my original pathology from 6 months ago hadn't made it, they couldn't re-read the slides unfortunately. That will come later in the week. If it something even more concerning, I will need an excisional biopsy. While I was there, they felt a new lump on the other side. They did an ultrasound and a biopsy while I was there. They think it might be a fibroadenoma, but it's sent off to pathology to be sure. The waiting sucks. I talked with them about the FEA finding on my right side - that there are no standardized pathology definitions from institution to institution for FEA vs. ADH etc. So they might read it very differently than the other pathologist from 6 months ago. So again, I feel like I'm starting again. What is odd about the pathology report that I got, was that while the pathologist noted his/her findings (FEA etc.) they didn't put any recommendation...like get a 6 month followup or see a BS etc. I don't understand why there would be nothing written in that section of the report. Two questions for y'all: How fast can fibroadenomas grow? It wasn't there last December in any of the tests etc. It is very strange. Can a core biopsy from 6 months ago leave scar tissue? They noted that on my mamo report. Thanks all! C",
