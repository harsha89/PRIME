I could express small amounts of milk from my breasts for a long time after he was weaned, so I wouldn't be concerned with that. I am so glad I did breast feed them as I can always look bad to those very special moments especially given the fact that I had a bi-lateral mastectomy in 2008.  So keep us update on your findings. I will pray that everything will be fine. Sending you love & support. NJ",

I also had the jinlging pains across my back & down my arm.  While the risk of lymphedema is lower by taking only one node it is still possible to get it.  By taking only one node it has disrupted the flow of the lymphatic system.  If you learn to do the manual drainage you can change where the lymphatic fluid goes to.   I'm glad you insisted on the appointment and that you learn the techniques to manage it.   I would stop the heavy exercises with the arm until after you see the LE therapist.  Some exercise is good but that might what is aggravating it. There are others that know more than I do & they will probably give advise as well. NJ ",

My adive is to seek that sedond opinion.  Better to error on the side of caution then wait and they are wrong.  I'd do it  for peace of mind.  BTW, my mammo & us were negative.

With Taxol, I get RED face for about 2 days. Slowly started getting neuropathy in my hands & feet. As it progressed I couldn't tast my food. With Taxotere, I was nauseous and dizzy that would begin about 3 days after treatment.  Neuropathy was even worse on Taxotere (was suppose to be less).

(I've had a BMX with node dissection.) I was already having LE issues on that side as well. My rash wasn't going away so I went to my breast specialist and she did a biopsy that was negative.  My pcp said I have seroma and gave me steroids & antibiotics. I thought well let's get to a LE therapist and started the MLD. My arm was better, rash was a little better.  Then in November I spiked a temp and woke up with a massive rash.  After urgent care, ER & 3 days of IV antibiotic for cellulitus.  Now it is January and it still hasn't completely cleared.  I go back to my BS next week.  I hope she has some answers for me. She is awesome, but this is driving me nuts. So I understand your concern & frustration. NJ",

I used a Scoplamine 1.5 patch.  This really helped the dizziness & vertigo.  Plus I started taking Lortabs for pain. Personally for me, I would never take that drug again, unless I had no other choice. Hoping you are feeling better soon. NJ",

It turned out to be a good decision for me as I turned out to have precancer cells on the non-bc side.  Because of the aggressiveness of my bc I was told I would need to wait at least a year after rads before I could do reconstruction.  After radiation I had no interest in having reconstruction.  I tried to wear poofs but soon gave those up.  The rads made a mess out of my scar on my bc and it took a long time to heal. I really didn't mind at all being flat.  I just learned to dress in a different way & most people who didn't remember how I looked don't even notice that I am flat. I was at peace about being flat. This past year I started having a lot of infections & cellulitis on the bc side. I thought I would try to get a scar revision.  The plastic surgeon wanted me to do hyperbaric oxygen treatments before surgery.  So I did them & they did help clear up the cellulitis on my side & arm.   Unfortunately when I finally got to see the PS she tells me I can't just have a scar revision but she will need to do a lat-flap.  I was blown away when she told me.  I know that is a good procedure but just not one I want to have. So I found another PS who does the DIEP.  She confirmed my thinking that because I have such a large area of damage from the radiation that the DIEP is the best way to fix it.  I have decided to do it because I just can't go on having infections every couple of months.  I am at peace now about doing the reconstruction but I am still a little nervous about it. I was happy being flat. So for those who choose that option I support you 100%. I would just encourage everyone to make the best decision for YOU!  NJ",
