    "Content": "Siri1 wrote: Please help me as the oncologist has no experience with this. In June 2015 my blood counts were all normal. That is when I was dx with bone mets. After rads and a broken femur my red blood counts dropped very low. Onc thinks it's the disease and not rads, surgery or meds. What do you think?? In addition I started faslodex and zometa. I've had edema since starting and shortness of breath/coughing after the shot /infusion. Onc never heard of this. Anyone else??? Thank you. I'm really freaked. Log in to post a reply",
