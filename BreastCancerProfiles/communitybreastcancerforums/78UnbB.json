Hopefully I will be able to talk to her today. Now if only I could fall asleep. Going to try and go to work in the morning... might have to take off time in the near future with treatments. I don't want to worry about my job too. Again thank you for all your help and support. Hugs to all of you too!!",

We didn't have the final biopsy report but she sent me for a MRI. Driving home the doctor called and I found out that my breast cancer is a triple negative. Still have to read up on that. I have an appointment with an oncologist tomorrow!!! I thought Thursday was a blur... today I'm really in shock. So glad my sister, husband and brother in law were with me. I'm also so thankful for all the kind people who helped me today at my doctor's office and the imaging place. I'm even more scared",

I went the next day for a mammogram and an ultrasound of my right breast. Before I left the office I was told it was a complex cyst and recommended it be drained.i called my doctor on Monday and she was away all week but her nurse spoke to me and said the radiology office could do the drain procedure. I called for an appointment for the cyst drain and biopsy but they were not doing any biopsies that week because all of the doctor were off. So I scheduled it for Monday. They were able to do a needle core biopsy and suggested that they evacuate the whole cyst... which they did. My doctor called me Thursday and said the biopsy came back as malignant. I was at work and in shock that I didn't ask any questions. She said something about a mastectomy or lumpectomy. I don't even know what the diagnosis is. Do the you usually call you? I thought I would have a face to face appointment??? Don't know what to do next. I feel scared and anxious!!! Log in to post a reply",

Sorry I've been silent... it's only been a couple of days since the final diagnosis of TNBC... but feels like longer from all the appointments and tests done since this Monday. I've had an MRI after meeting with the breast surgeon. I had a thorough meeting with my oncologist and already scheduled for AC and Taxol treatment starting April 30th. I had to have another two biopsies of two sites today. And next week I'm having a PET scan, an echocardiogram and the IV Port implanted next Friday... it's overwhelming.. I was prescribed xanax without question and have been taking half a pill at night to help me sleep. I'm so thankful for all of your advice and guidance. I just realized I keep saying I ... We are all strong.. have been strong, and wiill be strong!!! You are the patient demand the treatment and prescriptions you need... don't take on anyone else's ignorance or biases. Needing some assistance or medication is absolutely okay!! Peace, Love, and Strength to us All !!!! Trying to take it one day at a time!! Hugs to all...",

My only son is away at college in his first year. His last final is May 4th. Not sure when I should tell him. He's coming home on the 20th for a family wedding. I'm hoping I can keep my composure while he is home... lol I don't think that will be successful. I just don't want to have him upset so close to finals. I don't know what to do. Ugh... it's just so hard",

I am still waiting on the final biopsy report. I don't know why they call you with such shocking results... I kind of blanked out... I was able to talk to my doctor's nurse. She was very helpful. I made an appointment with a Breast Surgeon Specialist on Monday morning. I think that was very helpful because I have the beginnings to a plan in motion. My Sister and Brother in law are going to come with me to see the doctor. I think I was so tired today after not sleeping last night and working a full day that I fell asleep on the couch for several hours. I am going to try some of the herbal suggestions. And on Monday ask the doctor about prescription suggestions for when all else fails. I know in the near future I'm going to get anxious again and I'm sure there will be some more sleepless nights. Taking to all of you has been really helpful and comforting.i think I might have said that before but it's worth repeating!!! I wish you all the best in your journeys as well.... hugs to all!! ",
