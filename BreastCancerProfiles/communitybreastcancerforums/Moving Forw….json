They were wonderful. I could not have asked for a better team to guide me through this process.  My skin has lost it's redness since I transitioned to the boost treatments (26-31) and looks light brown, or as if I have a fading tan. Still applying Miaderm. My fatigue level has subsided since I was hit hard a few weeks ago. I really feel great, much better than I expected at this point.  The only new piece of information I received today was that my RO and RN informed me that for the next 2 years I need to manually massage my breast and the adjacent armpit area for 5 minutes daily. This is to loosen the scar tissue from the lumpectomy and to promote blood flow. If I do not than that breast (left) will shrink and harden compared to my right. If anyone else in our group was advised of this need I would be curious to know. I see my RO in 4 weeks for a follow up. Will be starting Tamoxifen at that time-sigh. A sincere thank you for the support and camaraderie I gained from this forum. Wishing each of you positive energy and   strength in your continued journeys.",

I am definitely tired and doing my best to conserve my energy at work and at home. I am going to bed earlier... my 7 year old some nights is reading me a bedtime story! My skin in the treatment area is pink/red...definitely looks like sunburn. The skin under my armpit is dark brown.  Continuing to apply Miaderm, now 4 times a day vs. 2.  My skin in the treatment area is itchy at this point, on and off during the day, especially the nipple. Almost there! Wishing everyone continued strength on their journey! ",

The past two weeks my breast has been itchy, especially my nipple. I was applying Miaderm twice a day until the itchiness and redness started-- immediately after my treatment in the morning and at bedtime. I now apply it 4 times a day like you which stops the itchiness. My skin faired well. I started to get pink/red about halfway thru, and my lower underarm got brown, or darker than (around) my breast. I have had no open wounds or peeling.  Miaderm is great because it dries almost instantly and is not greasy. I do not care for the smell.  Best of luck to you and the rest of our group. We can do this!",

First half done!  Aside from continued darkening of my skin (see my previous post) which now includes my entire breast, it's been smooth sailing so far. I am still using Miaderm which I recommend (see my previous post). My 7 year old son came with me today to hang with the techs and see where I go for treatment. They let him announce on the intercom each time I had to hold my breath. When we were done he told me \"You did great mom\". Warmed my heart! Wishing everyone a Happy and Healthier New Year as we continue on our journeys. We can do this!!!",

I finish up January 22nd for a total of 31 treatments. I am an active 42 yo that works FT and has a 7 year old at home that keeps me on my toes! I am curious to see when the fatigue and skin changes kick in, and to what degree. One tip I want to share is I found a great deoderant that works and is RT friendly. The brand is called Crystal and they have two lines for women- Crystal and Crystal Essence. I am using the Crystal Essence roll on, Lavendar and White Tea scent. I highly recommend.  In the US you can buy at Walgreens and CVS. It's available at other stores around the world and online at Amazon and Drugstore.com. Best of luck to everyone as we continue on our journeys. We can do this!!!",

This morning I had the first of 6 boosts, so 26 out of 31 total course treatments are completed. I am in the home stretch and getting excited! I continue to pace myself which makes the fatigue managable and using Miaderm on my skin, which I highly recommend. Other than that I have been fortunate with no other side effects.

Let's see... everyone is nice to me, it's calm and quiet, there's mood lighting... much better than being at work! My energy level is the same for now. After treatment 6 (Monday) I noticed some slight darkening of my skin above and to the left of my breast- under my armpit. My RO recommended I start using Miaderm to help with the sunburn effect to come. I started to use Miaderm yesterday. You can order it off Amazon. I do not care for the smell but it is non greasy, easily absorbed and dries quickly. I apply it twice a day-immediately after my RT before I put my bra and shirt back on, and in the evening before bed.
