Several hours after my first chemo treatment I had two seizures (I'm on TC x 4). Luckily, my husband was there when it happened and he rushed me to ER. While in the ER I had another one. Apparently my sodium levels dropped too low, so they kept me in the hospital for two nights. My next chemo session is January 18th and they will hospitalize me again to watch me. So, for those of you that believe in prayer send a few up on this one! I think what the worse side effects for me were the fatigue and pain. Anyone here try acupuncture?
