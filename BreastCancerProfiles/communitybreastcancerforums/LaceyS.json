I am wondering, specifically if a liver tumor mets could be present causing weightloss for 3 years and still remain undiagnosed? The reason I ask is because my mom lost about 30 pounds 3 years ago (possibly a little more gradual over 3 years). She was maintaining a vigorous exercise routine and diet. She had been told she was in the top percent of normal bmi for weight 3 years ago and now she is on the lower scale of normal bmi. still normal though.most of the time she thinks it is her exercise, other times she worries becuase the pounds were able to come off in the first place.Â  i am just wondering if it is possible for a liver tumor to be present for that long (3 years) and not progress? i assume if it had gone to her liver it would have been a very aggressive breast cancer to go there immediately and therefore, wouldn't it have progressed by now? Also, have you ever heard of a breast tumor metastasizing right away? As in someone could have a tiny tumor like my moms but still having mets at time of diagnosis with no LVI or lymph nodes?",
