    "Content": "HelloStarr wrote: Hi all, I am feeling a little scared because:  Since August, my left breast has been feeling uncomfortable, itchy inside and now, painful.  The breast itself has felt tender and kind of painful/sore for the past two days.  (It's not related to my menstruation).  The pain feels deep on the other side too--kinda like it's hurting my shoulder blade too.  Also, my left armpit feels tender and burning...It's my actual left breast. I'm 29 and not sure if my family has any history... There are no visible symptoms: both breasts are the same size, there's no redness or anything.  And, (please don't judge me) I have small implants under my chest muscles...I am just worried because this feels like my breast tissue... Has anyone had a similar experience?  The pain was noticeable enough for the past two days that I felt really worn down and weak and out of it...I'm so worried and really need some advice...  Thank you all...
