My oncologist started me on Tamoxifen in January though I am only slightly PR positive. I have not started using any cream yet.  The pharmacy at the cancer centre here has 100% aloe vera gel for sale.  Anyone that is looking for it may want to check their cancer centre pharmacy. Looking forward to all of this being over.",
