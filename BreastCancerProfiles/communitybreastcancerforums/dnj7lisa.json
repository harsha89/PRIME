      "Content": "dnj7lisa wrote: Hey all. 2 years ago I found a lump in my breast and had a breast exam, mammogram and sonogram. Lump was palpable and both doctor and I could feel it. It was sore and still causes me some pain and discomfort to this day. Both the Mammogram and Sonogram did not show anything and thus the clinic gave me \"it's most likely nothing but we don't really know\" answer. So to this day I still don't have a clue as to what it is. This past year I've been having all kinds of health related symptoms and issues. Whether or not they are all related or different things I have yet to know. Been having migraines, cysts and abcesses popping up all over my skin, rashes, memory issues, morning nausea (even during my monthly cycle), fatigue, dizziness, ringing in my ears, intestinal issues, and just last month I was diagnosed with a pilonidal cyst or Pilonidal Sinus Disease. That last one is no fun and if you don't know what it is, hope that you never get it because it is a lifetime issue that will require surgery and won't ever go away even with surgery. Many surgeries may be in my future, idk I still have to meet with a colon and rectal surgeon. Also have unexplained weight loss. Went from 140 to 123 in a matter of weeks. Haven't been doing anything different, eating the same, same amount of exercise (maybe even less). 2 years ago I was gaining weight for no reason, now I'm losing. My clothes are starting to hang on me. During all of this over the past month I have also noticed a slight change in my breasts. It seems that the breast which does not have the lump is starting to sag a little bit more than the breast with the lump. And the breast with the lump has had a nipple color change over the past week. It is definitely taking on a brown tone while the other is still a pink tone. Should I be worried? If the clinic had told me they definitely knew that it was a benign lump I would have been able to rest easy. But telling me that they don't know what it is and sending my off to live with it, is not a resolution for me. I know there are those out there having to deal with a positive diagnosis and all that it entails, and my heart and prayers go out to each and every one of you. I wish you all good health and complete recovery, but I can't help stressing about myself. I have kids and a sick mother-in-law to take care of. As for getting this checked out, I'm still working on getting health insurance set up. I'm currently uninsured. I tried signing up for covered california but they told me that I didn't make enough money (I'm unemployed) and wasn't eligible. Go figure. Not eligible for Medi-cal because my boyfriend claims me as a dependent and I'm not eligible for his insurance either because we don't meet the partner requirements. We have no way to show we have been living together for the past 22 years because we live with his mother and thus don't have a rental agreement. Insurance refuses to take a letter from his mother, So I'm kinda screwed when it comes to healthcare. It sucks big time, especially when anything goes wrong I have to try and self diagnose through google and try and find some home remedies because I just can't afford to go to the doctor. Anyway just wanted to share and vent my stress. If any of you have any thoughts I would love to hear it. Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "dnj7lisa wrote: Hi.  I recently found a painful lump in my breast and have made an appointment to get it checked out on Thursday.  I'm very scared, stressed & nervous.   Let me start at the beginning.  And I will apologize in advance of the possible length of this post. Last year my mom was diagnosed with stage 3c fallopian tube cancer.  She underwent a hystorectomy and chemo.  There has never been any history of any type of cancer in my family...so it was a little shocking.  I knew that a diagnosis of stage 3c cancer is not too good but there's always a chance so I felt worried but hopeful.  She was healthy, feeling good all through chemo and after.   Then about 3 months ago I, myself started getting these achy pains in my left breast area by my heart.  Thought it weird but as I'm 43 little funny aches & pains in my body come and go so I didn't really think anything of it...that was until about 2 months ago when it was really bothering me and I decided to feel around at the site of the pain...and my heart dropped when I felt a rather large lump.  At least 2-3 fingers in size.  Painful to touch.  A weird achy pain can also be felt if I lay on that side or stomach.  I personally have never dealt well with stress or problems...I usually deal with it by ignoring it.  So I decided to keep an eye on this over the next month to make sure it wasn't a monthly thing.  Then tried to ignore it for another 3 weeks.   Within that 3 week timeframe I got a call from my mom (she lives 3,000 miles away hence the call) and she told me that the cancer had spread to her blood vessels in her rectal area and she is now currently undergoing another round of chemo.  This hit me hard...much harder than the first time.  So I decided to feel around again to see if my lump was still there...it is. This painful lump with the news of my mom has me seriously stressed, scared & nervous.  I currently am a stay at home mom of 4 kids & have no insurance. So I have had to wait to gather money to make an appointment to get this checked out.  I will be going into Planned Parenthood on Thurs to get it checked...but within the last week the achy pain has been more persistant and now a very small circular red spot (smaller than an eraser) just appeared out of nowhere on the side of my breast about 4 days ago.  I'm not sure if this has anything to do with the painful lump or not but it has me really scared.  I've been paying attention to my breast and have seen no other changes in it. Has anyone else had these symptoms and had them turn out to be nothing or cancer?  I'm very nervous and I think feeling overly sensitive and stressed because of what's going on with my mom right now.  I don't want to go to the doctor because really I'm expecting the worst case senario.  Very nervous & scared. In addition, I've never really thought anything of it until now mainly because I have moles and raised moles all over my body, but I have had a raised mole on the side of my breast for years & years.  This is very close to where the lump is.  Don't know if this has anything to do with the lump or not but I've been reading through this site and do not see any other posts or mentions of anything similar to this. Any input, advice or mentions of someone who has had any similar symptoms will be very helpful to me right now.  Am I just worrying over nothing?   Log in to post a reply",

I do want to say that I've been reading through all the posts here and the women here are an inspiration.  Thank you to everyone for sharing your stories.

However not much else was said except that I needed to get in for a mammogram. Luckily I'll be doing that on Fri...just 2 days to wait for that. Still have no clue to either a possibility of B9 or Malignant. So I play the waiting game some more. So does lump size matter? Could it be an indicator of what it may be or perhaps staging of it does turn out to be cancer? Log in to post a reply",

Will have to call them today.",
