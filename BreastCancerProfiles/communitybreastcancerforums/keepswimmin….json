      "Content": "Apr 25, 2013 05:46PM keepswimming wrote: I am also questioning why I need rads. My MO said its based on the size of the tumor and has become standard practice in most cases. I have an occult cancer stage 3c, so i dont have a \"normal\" case. After chemo and surgery I am clear and my surgeon said there was absolutely no cancer left to kill. I also have te's in place but my biggest concern is I read that down the road scar tissue can affect the heart and lungs. If I wasn't clear I wouldn't question doing radiation but why would I risk future heart and lung problems with my current dx? My MO is pretty adamant, I'm not sure how to handle this. Any thoughts? Thx",
