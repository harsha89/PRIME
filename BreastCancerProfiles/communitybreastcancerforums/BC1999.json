Just wanted to share what I know about Doxil: I was told by my onchologist and then read on the internet that Doxil time to response is longer than other chemos; it says you need to give 4 months for this drug to see if it's working or not. Another thing is that Doxil works on a small group of BC patients. Second opinion may be a good idea, agree with PJB. Hoping Doxil starts working quickly and gives you some piece of mind. Pakize",

While all treatments were finished i already hit age of 40. It was time for baby again but it was hard this time. After all, i was almost 40 and had chemo in my past. Anyway, managed to get pregnant. Great! Cancer is in the past, baby is coming life is back to normal rigth? Wrong, diagnosed with bc for the second time while 13 weeks pregnand. Had 11 nodes positive which made me IIIc and don't know at the time if i have mets or not since they can not scan all the body because of the baby. Making long story short, that was 2006. I had my baby while 34 weeks pregnant who is 3 years old now. Had 4 rounds of EC during pregnand 2 rounds taxol and after birth 2 rounds of taxotere. Then radiation again and now on arimidex. Stayed at stage IIIc until today and hoping to remain same for a long while. I had same fears, is my baby going to know me? Am i going to be able to raise him etc... Well, today i still am here. Don't know if i will be able to pass my next check-up on January but have hopes. And i hope my history gives you some courage. Best wishes, Pakize",

Please try to keep in mind that nowadays with the new protocols and treatments this desease is more controlable. And one last thing from my experiances : even i was stage I in my first diagnosys it was harder for me back then to cope with bc.

I also would expect he orders some other scans such as CT, MRI or ultrasound that your insurance will cover. With these assumptions here are my questions: 1. Wich scan other than PET/CT will provide with the most reliable info, in your case the scan that can distinguisg inflammation then met in liver 2. If he orders CT you may want to be sure how different info CT alone can provide than CT already taken during PET 3. Can he overrule the possibility of inflammation by having blood tests? Wouldn't he expect some abnormal values in the blood if this is inflammation. This question can be asked vise versa, can he overrule met possibility by having blood tests, markers, liver enzymes etc? 4. Did you already started Abraxane? If yes, you probably already have some blood work before starting it, would it be valuable to repeat these at this point? 5. You can ask him straigth forward why he is not sure what this is and what makes him uncomfortable so you can have better understanding and go from there These are questions I can think of at first hand. If anything else comes up before it is morning over there I will post again. Good luck and I hope things gets clearer and easier after you phone call... Pakize",

For the first 2 times it wasn't hard at all, I did not have him at that time. But now I didn't want him to see me sick. He somehow already has that fear something may happen to his mom and dad :( So, I bought that expensive wig which is a human hair and can be attached with some FDA approved sort of a glue to the scalp. All I need to do is to go once a month to the saloon remove it, do some maintenance then they attach it again and life is good! I can wash it, I can fix it, I can swim, anything... But life is not that easy rigth? Wig is not comfortable and does not look like my hair at all!!! My son now says I look like a rock star. Every nigth I want to take it off but can't because I don't want my son to see me and also if I remove it I am not going to be able to attach it back by myself. So, I am stuck. For the first time loosing my hair made me cry and feel very very bad. Now, I am spending more money and buying 2 more wigs. I will wear one of them at nigth so my son won't see me bald if he wakes up suddenly and will wear the other one during the day. I am not sure if this will be a good solution either but just wanted you to know that I feel what you feel and am very sorry that you too have to go through this. BUT so hope the new treatment works great for a very long time. Pakize",

I was 13 weeks pregnant. I was watched carefully because of my BC history and they catched it vis ultrasound and biopsy. They could not scan the full body because of pregnancy. I had immediately mastectomy and after recovery since I was in my second trimester we started chemotherapy (EC). I was assured that I will get same treatment as if I was not pregnant and also told that drug they will give me is safe for the baby. AC protocol (Adriamycin+Cytoxan) is a known protocol and safe during pregnancy. They gave me Epirubycin instead of Adriamycin but it is just another version of Adriamycin. Also I was told that terminating the pregnancy will not change the life expectancy. I continued the pragnancy and now have a healthy 4.5 years old boy. After birth I was scanned and no metastasis were detected at the time. I was staged as IIIc. Unfortunately 4 years later my cancer metastasized to my bones but I still feel very fortunate to have my little boy. I hope to stay around for as long as he needs me. I hope this info helps in anyway because I know there is limited data about BC during pragnancy. My best wishes,",
