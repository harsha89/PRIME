This started after the second treatment but I thought maybe it was the positioning when you get the treatment (arms overhead and all that) However it is not bothering my right side where I am not having treatment. Can the BP start that soon? I am 68 and in great shape otherwise and if this could be BP I am going to talk to my onc. and see we can skip this rads and go right toÂ something else. So, has anyone ever heard of it starting so soon? My rads onc just kind of passed over this side effect.",
