    "Content": "cass34 wrote: Based on an extensive maternal family history, I am considering a prophylactic oophorectomy and/or a bilateral mastectomy. I do not have breast cancer, my Mother is BRCA negative. I am pre-menopausal, and do not want any more natural children. I am screened annually by mammogram and MRI. The ooph would put me in surgical menopause. If I choose the bilat mastectomy, I will have reconstruction from my own tissues. I am healthy and young (guessing about 10 years before completed menopause) with a wonderful, supportive family. It is clear that there is a genetic component to the cancer in my Mother's family, but it has not been identified. The tumors are estrogen-fed. I will not take bcp's, and I do not plan on HRT, whatever course I choose. I am looking for information based on personal experience with surgical menopause, as well as the actual surgeries. I am struggling with the time-frame as to when I need to make this decision and when to have one or both surgeries. Any reminders about what questions I need to ask my docs and surgeons would also be great. I am anxious to do what I can to prevent this disease. Log in to post a reply",
