He is on vacation this week and i am so tempted to pull it since it has slowed considerably.  if anyone has had this problem, i would appreciate any input. also, until this drain is gone, i can't start chemo....THANKS",

It's funny (kind of), I am a big girl, I don't have high blood pressure, diabetes, or take meds for anything but this stupid cancer. But I've had my share of surgery. I told my surgeon \"just take my other boob, and do a complete hysterectomey and be done with it already!\" He said he wished he could open up a clinic just for removing extra organs and parts that we (including men,prostates etc.)don't need anymore!

My energy finally decided to show back up yesterday afternoon, and I feel better today (stomach is a little weird though) At least I might be able to get some things done today. I need to take my graceful 17yr old to the dr, she thinks she broke her toe at work, goofy kid. I know there isn't anything they can do for a broken toe, but she will get written up if she calls in and doesn't have a dr note (thats one way for kids to be responsible!).  Those of you talking about the Onco test....my tumor was small (1.5cm) but because of my age..45..the dr suggested I have chemo. My Onco score was low and he told me I could skip chemo, but I don't want to take any chances.  No matter how many tests get done, you just never know if there might be little cells lurking somewhere. I have good insurance, so that probably played a part in my decision. I will then be on Tamoxofen for 5 yrs.  To me, the chemo is just added insurance for my treatment.

Even though I don't respond to everyones posts, you are all in my heart constantly!  I have felt so crappy this time, I don't know how it can get worse.  I've had the funky weird dreams, I wake up with my legs cramping, for two days I couldn't even function except to go potty...this is Tuesday (right??) and I still feel like crap.  I tried to do some things around the house this morning and my heart started racing and I got sweaty........there I go, parking my butt on the couch again!  I usually have my full taste back by now...so I guess not until this is over! I have the second half of 2nd round on Thursday and then off next week and I hope I'm not in as bad a shape as this past weekend. At least by then it will be half over!!! YEAH!Ok, can I whine some more!!  I think I'm going to ask for some ativan on Thursday, maybe that will take away the stupid weird dreams that I wasn't having before! Sara....on the vaginal thing, not sure about that one sorry.  You might try using some baby wipes and see if that helps. I know when I had my \"chemo education\", the onc nurse told my husband to use condoms to protect himself.  I guess chemo does some really strange things to a person! A word on the confidence thing....I'm one of those people that don't care what other people think about me (when it comes to most things). I act like myself around people I know, I go to walmart without my prosthesis (sometimes it's just too damn hot to wear it!) If I don't want to wear a headcovering, then oh well! people can think what they want since they don't have a clue what's going on with me!!  Love yourselves, no matter how you THINK you look!  If someone wants to think I'm crazy for leaving the house with only ONE BOOB, that's their problem! They don't know what it feels like to wake up from surgery with something gone that you've had all your life, and how fake it feels to have a chunk of plastic in your bra. Don't worry about others (except family of course!) or what they think!   OK, I will get off my high horse. I do feel better anyway LOL! I have everyone has a great evening! lots and lots of HUGS to ALL!!!! KIM",

The taste bud thing is the WORST! I can't stand the saltwater mouth wash stuff they told me to use, maybe I will just make it with baking soda and see if that works. It's hard to even drink water, but a little more tolerable with ice. My tongue feels kind of numb today.  Ok, enough whining! I am alive and that's what counts right now, we will make it through everything else! I hope everyone has a blessed day!  Lots of Hugs to everyone!",

I will be sure to ask the onc nurse if there is anything else I can do. I did take claritin and tylenol before the shot but it (the neulasta) didn't hit me until the steroids wore off.... Doodlebug...I had to laugh when you mentioned \"accidents\"! I thought I was going to have one today! My daughter went with me to pick up something to eat after I got hubby home from the hospital..I told her they were taking too long....when we finally got home I just ran in the house and my hubby was wondering what was going on...I had to break down and take some imodium! I'd rather have D than C, except I was going every 5 minutes! I had to wait for the imodium to work before I could even go get his pain pills!  It's hard for me these days to get the water down too..I know I need to force myself but when water doesn't even taste good, it makes it difficult.. Madismommy...Thanks! Taylor...I Hope you feel better! OK...I need to go to bed...gnight again!",

My hair is so fine and thin as it is, it will probably all go at once! I also wonder if it's because my chemo is spread over two weeks instead of doing it all on one day. I have it two Thursdays in a row and then off  one week....who knows, everyones treatment is so different. I still feel crappy today, no energy and I'm tired but can't sleep.  I finally went to the store this morning to do some shopping and I thought I was going to pass out! I hope everyone has a good evening! HUGS Kim",

She almost started to cry and I told her she better not or we would both be bawling! So far I haven't cried, but I made both of my daughters cry.  I told my 13yr old, it's only temporary! She wants to shave her head, but I don't want her to, middle schoolers are very mean. I actually feel human today, just a slight headache, but that's probably because it's so hot here. I hope everyone is feeling better and getting the stomach issues under control. It is very hard to make yourself eat when you just don't feel like eating. My chemo nurse said that if you try to keep something in your stomach, it should help to not get sick to your stomach. She suggested small meals every two hours, sometimes it works, sometimes not....Thankfully, I have not had too much trouble with nausea Feel Better everyone....Hugs",

She said I had a nice round head. She also told me to just save the head coverings until the weather turns cooler, but that wont work for me, I'm too self concious! I hope everyone is doing well over on the east coast with minimal problems!",

I constantly get told how brave I am and how good I look, but people really have no idea what's going on inside me!! It  was funny, the other day when our 4 and 5 yr old grandkids came over, neither one of them even noticed or said anything about my shaved head. I've always had pretty  short hair, I guess that's why it didn't phase them.  I figure by the beginning of next week my hair will be completely gone. I made it up the mountain yesterday and had lunch with a friend. It was nice to get out of the house! I hope everyone has a good day! (((((HUGS)))))",
