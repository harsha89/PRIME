I expected the pain to resolve, but it actually got worse for about 2 1/2 months after starting the arimidex. My tumor markers were decreasing this entire time. In retrospect I attribute the pain to tumor flare. I've been pain free for more than a year - something that I never thought would happen during that 2 1/2 months. I can't say what is causing your pain, but it might be tumor flare? Maybe your onc. can prescribe some different type of pain medication. I was taking vicodin and ibuprofen and that worked for me, allowed me to continue work, but it was difficult. I hope your pain resolves soon,",

Nowhere near the pain that EmilyinOntario had, just a nagging low grade infection, but that makes me nervous. My onc said that the chemo would aggrevate any issues like that. tfinn99 - Keep going! I so felt like quiting too. My second TX was awful. I'm starting to dread the third and it's still a week away. Let's think that TX 3 for you will be way better because your cold will be gone. I think we are all becoming experts at this chemo thing, our coping skills are getting better each round as well as our management of SE's. Kim61- Your pic is great! On deciding on your surgery, get as much information as you can and go in to talk to your surgeon as many times as you need. I can share my reasons for my BMX if your interested, just PM me. DancingMom - I have my moments of completely not coping at all!!! You are not alone. During my bad week, every dish in the house was dirty! I didn't have the energy to load the dishwasher. House was a complete wreck. You are not alone. AimeeMac - I got Lorazepam (ativan) shortly after my diagnosis, because I wasn't sleeping. It worked wonders for me, I only took it a few times, when I couldn't sleep, or before procedures. No real side effects that I noticed. Really helped quiet the racing mind. Thought I would take it before chemo, but haven't needed to. ProudMom - Hurray for last AC!!!!! Yippee!

JulieH, How does your head feel?  I chickened out and didn't shave my head this morning (today's day 17).  Hubby hacked it with scissors, about 2inches all around.  Wore a hat to the grocery store, but felt tight on my head which is still a bit sore.  At home I had to go without a head covering, freaking the kids out (13 and 18), but we just joked about it, and continued our day.  Maybe tomorrow I will go for the buzz.  Monday will be the wig for sure at work, really dreading that. Anniemom, I had decadron and was fine.  From these boards, it seems that people really like the Emend. baf4292, How is your arm now?  How awful, did the swelling go away quickly.  I bet they'll be extra careful with you from now on.",

JulieH - how bad is the tremor?  I have a muscle twitching on my face that won't stop (3 days now) wondering if I should mention this to onc.  I feel like a hypochondriac sometimes, but I guess we are allowed to be hyper aware during this.

Are you doing a scan before your surgery?  Maybe you could look after 4 rounds and see if it's shrunk enough?  Maybe they could even check with a simple ultrasound to get a rough idea??  I'm hoping that round 3 will be easier.  Also, I think it's accepted that reducing chemo up to 15% can be done without loss of benefit - something to ask ONC.   Good Luck and hang in there. webu - great story, glad you made it home safe.  Hope the time with your daughter was nice.  MaryMeg - we aren't getting much info in the states about what's going on, but we are thinking about all who are suffering.  Kim - YAHOO for making it through AC  and YAHOO for shrinkage.  Good luck with all the doctors appointments.  I too have a strong family history, but came out BRCA1/2 negative. Relieved at that but still beleive there must be a genetic component.  Worried that my sister won't take things seriously because of the negative result.  Any chance we could get a picture or 2 posted of beautiful Hawaii and St John when you guys return??

Chemo was Hard! (and I only did 4 rounds)  I'm going back to work soon and I'm really not looking forward to it. Physically I don't feel ready, (still fatigued, waves of nausea hit me randomly, and I have that weird muscle weakness in my thighs) and mentally I'm drained.  I don't think I will ever do that again.  Lately I've been obsessing about how do the stage 4 folks live their life on chemo?  Will I change my mind about not ever doing chemo again if I one day find myself at stage 4?  I'm wishing you all brighter days and smiles",

This is so frustrating that we just don't fully understand this disease.  It would be so much easier if science could tell us exactly the course this awful cancer will take in our bodies.",

How cool is that. My hubby takes it, so I pilfered some of his pills and took it for a month.  My oncologist wasn't really aware of it, so I spent today gathering articles that I will give her tomorrow.  After my chemo is over I'm going to look into getting in one of the clinical trials (taking the chance that I would be in the placebo arm).  Wouldn't that be great if a well studied, low side effect, inexpensive, oral drug would have efficacy in breast cancer. PS-DH gets his metformin for free at QuikChek (a store like 7-11) don't know how they can do that?",

I am also, node neg, ER+ and HER2-, and stage 1.  We will get our greatest benefit from blocking estrogen (tamoxifen).  My oncotype score is 25, solidly in the intermediate range.  It is questionable how much benefit I will receive from chemo, I'm guessing a few percentage points.  When we have the data from the TAILORx study we will know how beneficial chemo is for intermediate oncotype scores. I got THREE opinions.  Two recommeded TCx4 and one recommended AC+T dose dense.  I have requested to do TC x 6 after reading many papers and listening to : \u2022Breast Cancer Treatment 2010: Medical Oncology Sara Hurvitz, MD http://www.simmsmanncenter.ucla.edu/information/insights_summaries/insights_summaries.asp I found that getting as much information as possible really helped me accept that I need chemo and helped me gain a sense of control. Let me leave you with something on of the onc's said that really struck me:  \"Right now (meaning before recurrence) we have one chance to cure your disease\"  Wishing you the lowest possible oncotype score, good luck!",

My shame = one of my bedroom dressers got pulled out from the wall for some reason (some of the clutter on top must have fell behind) - it's been that way for months - we just walk around it. Why don't we just push it back, it would take 30secs. What is wrong with us!?!?! A note about men/floors. We have a roomba (I highly recommend it for hardwood floors, not so much for carpet). My husband is a big tech/gadget guy. The roomba is his new toy, he runs it almost everyday. Our floors have never been cleaner - before he never even noticed the tumbleweeds from our 2 dogs piling up. I'm keeping my mouth shut and just waiting to see how long he will continue with his new 'toy'. Don't get me started about beagles. Ours thinks he's king of the world. He sometimes pees in my bed (how awful is that). My husband blames me and thinks he does it because I yell at him to get off the bed. So now when I catch him (beagle not husband) in the bed I have to talk very nice to him and give him a treat to get off. My next life I want to come back as a beagle, he is really the boss in my house for sure. Thanks for the laugh and have a good night,",
