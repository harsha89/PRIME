I know i'm in a better situation than more advanced girls but there's not as much comfort in that as one might think. My doctors have flat out told me i'm looking for answers where there aren't any in regard to stage 0 BC. It's thought of as pre-cancer or lucky cancer and as such no one cares about it. I was told by my RO that no one is interested in studying it because it's not life threatening. They don't think I need Tamox,would do little to help,same w/rads. But it could,they can't be 100%. This is the assurance I get after years of research and loads of money spent. It just wan't on stage 0 BC,so lucky me??? I hope to be here in 5 or 10 yrs to answer \"yes\" and so do the doctors. At this point hope is all they have,not concrete evidence. I don't know what it's going to take to learn more about BC and treat it well enough the first time on the more advanced cases either. Sadly I don't think the doctors have a handle on this as much as people think they do.",

He aquired an infection one Dec and was told it was due to so many surgeries going on before the holidays. That nobody washes their hands or instruments thoroughly because they're so busy during the holiday time. Is this actually true? I find it hard to believe but figured it couldn't hurt to ask since you all know what goes on in hospitals.",
