I opted to have the bilateral mastectomy.  I'm those people who like to take control of things so it was a easy decision for me.  While my surgeon didn't influence me one way or the other, she was relieved that I chose the bilateral mastectomy.  It turned out that they found some evidence of \"mild ductal hyperplasia\" in the other breast during the surgery so I was glad I did what I did. Hang in there!  I promise you things will get better. The ladies here are great.  They supported me during the most difficult time.  Take care.  Marie",
