      "Content": "AllYouNeedIsLove wrote: Hey all, I just finished my first week of radiation with 5 1/2 weeks left. Last night I noticed my breathing felt sensitive, on my left side, where the radiation is. The best way to describe it is like if you have allergies or are in the beginning stages of a chest cold. It's as if my airway feels like it has a tickle. I am terrified of lung/heart problems, but I trust my radiation team so much. Has anyone experienced this, or have any tips to help? Thank you!
