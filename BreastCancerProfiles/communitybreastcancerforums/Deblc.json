The five year survival rate, NOT your overall survival rate, is said to be 93%. 7% have died at the 5-year mark because it has recurred and/or metastasized, within the 5 years. For whatever reason...no one knows why some people progress and some don't. Could have the same exact treatment. Just freaking bad luck. I know when we are first diagnosed we agonize over all the numbers. But it's all a crap shoot. Lucy..I think the estimated stats are that overall, 30% of all \"early Stage\" (i.e., I, II and III) BC patients eventually become metatastic. I've stopped looking at numbers. All it does is scare the crap out of me, and no-one knows who is more susceptible to recurrence, and when.

I think it took a month after surgery for the pain to be not as severe (i,e, I could do without painkillers on a regular basis. By the way, do not put up with pain, let your surgeon know if the painkillers are not working). I did have occasional \"shooting\" pain over the mastectomy area for months afterwards. I started chemo a month after surgery, which really wiped me out, but I think I would have been feeling fine on a day-to-day basis two months out from surgery, without chemo to deal with. However, getting back full range of motion takes a while, and it is different for everybody. My MX was on the left side, so I was able to manage quite well, I THOUGHT, until I needed to do radiation.  I would recommend you talk to your surgeon about physical therapy after surgery, and when is a good time to start, especially if you need to do radiation, for which you need to be able to lift your arm fully above your head. I found my surgeon did not really do any follow up with me in this regard. I just posted this in the radiation forum: (It is six months post surgery for me) and I still have tightness across chest and underarm, problems with range of motion and difficulty/pain lifting arm fully over head. Granted I did not do any exercising during the five months of chemo. A week and a half ago, I could not even get my arm in position for the radiation simulation, I was in so much pain, much less hold it for 20 minutes. Since then, I had physio for 5 sessions and my range of motion is much better, and the pain vastly disminished. I would recommend PT for everybody who has had breast cancer surgery, especially if you are having radiation. I wish my surgeon had told me to do so a lot sooner. Exercising on your own may help, but my therapist also deep-massages the entire chest/arm/underarm/rib area to \"loosen up\" adhesions from scar tissue, which made a huge difference to that tight feeling around chest and under arm. (Note: my surgeon says I am an anomaly, I would really be interested in hearing other people's experience as to their recovery)",

WHEN will it start to grow ???!!!!!!!  I used to wear scarves inside my house, whenever I had visitors (My immediate family has seen me bald from the get go). Now I go topless at home, it's just too hot and uncomfortable, and I see the shock and discomfort on visitors' faces when they see me, like they don't want to look me in the face (I'm not an attractive bald lady unfortunately lol). One friend even said \"I hope your hair grows back fast, it really looks....\" but she didn't finish the sentence. I know she meant \"it really looks horrible\". But you know what..I DON'T CARE. I'm so glad I don't care any more what friends/extended family think when they see me bald, i.e., how ugly/horrible I look.... it's very freeing.  However, I wish I were brave enough to go out in public with my bald head, but I'm not there yet. Any ladies flaunt their bald heads in public ?...I am really tired of scarves and hats now.",

My MO has the same policy as most, no tests unless I am symptomatic, apart from yearly mammograms on my remaining breast. However, she will do scans, \"if I insist\". After much agonizing, I am at the point now where I have decided, no scans. Why?  If I feel fine, I don't want the stress of scanning, more scanning if they see anything suspicious, possible biopsies, etc etc etc.,  I AM SICK of cancer treatment, am almost done with it, and don't want to do any more !!!  What if I do a scan immediately after I'm done and they find something? I don't think I could go through that torture (chemo etc) again so soon......not to mention the mental torture. I figure if I am symptom free and feeling fine, I will have better quality of life doing nothing, versus than if I discovered something and had to start treatment again, which will make my life miserable. Especially if it's likely that the treatment won't cure me anyway. ",

Not very long by any means, but now hardly any bald areas. At first I was still embarrassed about being seen like this, but now I go out in public everywhere, supermarket/restaurants even. I get lots of looks, and I can tell sometimes that people whom I haven't seen in a while are shocked and uncomfortable when they see me, but after a while everybody gets used to it.

I still didn't believe it was caused by the cancer after I was diagnosed, thought it might be ibs or something like that, but from the responses here I realize that it is a symptom. Even though my oncologist told me it wasn't. Why do these doctors never seem to know what side effects of anything are?????? I have learnt so much more on this board than from my doctor !! I think we are very much on the same page re quality of life. I have read everybody's posts (in another thread I started asking about their experiences)over and over, and I think I really have decided no chemo at all. I kept a diary during my first set of treatments, and at the time I told my husband that I was never doing it again. I think you forget how bad it was, but that diary reminded me. I don't see the point of living like that. As you say, many (most?) people do treatments over and over and suffer the side effects etc. These are brave brave women. I am not so brave. So far, apart from the stomach issues, I am not doing badly. Mostly I am very tired and weak (probably more from not eating, than from the cancer) , yet I am SO TIRED of it all....of feeling sick . When it gets worse, and I know it will, I don't know how I will get through it. Re assisted suicide....I feel very lucky that that option is open to me. I do not want any long drawn out pain and suffering, not to mention how hard it is on the family. My only fear is that I would get too sick to travel to take advantage of it, as I currently do not live in the country where it is available. The truth of the matter is, I don't feel I have it in me to fight. I am SO TIRED!!! I can't walk two steps without being short of breath. I can't enjoy food, my stomach hurts every time I eat. I don't want to go anywhere or socialize with anybody, because I feel sick!!!! What kind of life is that?????? I strongly feel that part of cancer treatment should be to invent a pill that we can take to go to sleep and never wake up.....peacefully. I would do that right now, instead of having to suffering what I know is in store for me. Leave it up to us, make it OUR CHOICE, instead of having a doctor do it. It's our life..and death!!!!! If they can't find a cure, then for God's sake, find a way to stop our suffering. They put animals out of their misery, it's so inhumane to let human beings suffer in some misguided belief about the \"sanctity\" of life.",

I have just been diagnosed with liver mets, and am wondering if anyone here has declined or stopped treatment, and what that has meant for you. Also, has anyone has severe stomach problems from liver mets? In the past few months I have had trouble eating, I feel full all the time so don't want to eat. I also have constant diarrhea, lower abdominal pain, nausea, and have lost a lot of weight from barely eating. This is actually how they found the mets, from a CT. However my doctor says that she doesn't think these symptoms are caused by the liver mets, as they are still quite small.",

I reiterate what everyone else said about talking to your doctor for meds to mitigate the side effects. No, the se's might not go away completely but some are more manageable than others, and believe it or not, you will get used to dealing with them.  The nausea was the worse for me and my Doc changed my meds three times before I found a combination that worked. As badhairday said... Some days you just have to live 10 minutes at a time.....one minute at time!  And there are good days in between the horrible ones. It's just too overwhelming to think you will have to suffer months of this so don't anticipate. Just try to deal with what is happening in that moment. Trust me, I wanted to give up many times, and just had to reach a place of acceptance that this is what I had to deal with right now. If I had agonized about the 7 months of chemo/radiation I still had ahead of me,  I would've given up for sure.  I've finished chemo and rads almost three months now, I didn't think I would get through it, but I did....one minute at a time !!!",

But I guess pain is THE symptom, so I should be looking into it. I just don't want to, because I finished treatment not too long ago, and should they find anything, I am in no frame of mind to go back into any treatment !",

Even just two weeks after surgery his attitude was that I was the only patient he had that complained about pain !!!! And now, over a year later, he claims that nobody has pain this long after the surgery. So he wants me to do scans. I don't want to do unnecessary scans, but I just don't know if this is post mastectomy pain or some thing else.",
