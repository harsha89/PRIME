All I can say is keep your chin up and keep your mind busy or else you will drive yourself crazy.  They already have given you great odds that this thing is b9 which is awsome and the fact that they are goig to biopsy it and get rid of it is better yet. the only good lump is one in a jar as the gals on here are so great at saying.  Good luck and keep us posted.

I had a Breast MRI last Thursday I will hear those results anytime now. What I have been doing is keeping myself very busy. My house shines like a new penny lol. I am 42 with 4 children 2 are grown and 2 are still at home with us. By staying very busy I have managed to stay sane so to speak. The first couple of weeks I cried alot and messed around here but the last bit here I have found an inner me that I didn't even know I had. More than a few prayers have been said and I feel answered at my house. The good lord has given me a feeling of peace that everything is as it should be and things will be just fine. Please hold on and know we are all pulling for you. ",
