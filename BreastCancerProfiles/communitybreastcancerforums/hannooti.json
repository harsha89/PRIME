I wanted to have your points of view whether to have a tram flap or implant. I DO fear the pain ..Actually i feel having the mastectomy pain alone is enough , i would'nt want to have another BIG pain in the abdomen at the same time. But when i come to think of it , i have a REALLY BIG TUMMY. I have 5 kids and my tummy looks like as if i am in my 7th months of pregnancy.my doctor told me when i delivered my last baby i need to do  a tummy tuck otherwise my back will hurt alot. Now my back DO HEART ALOT.I find it is a very good chance to do the tram flap to remove the excess skins and flabby muscles ,but am afraid of the pain . For those who did this kind of recostruction , is it painful ? I mean extraordinary painful? is it anything like c section? how long - in general - does it need to heal? Log in to post a reply",
