Found out today that I have a small seroma, so heat packs for that a couple times a day over the weekend. Decided today to use some of my PTO, with the drive being 90 minutes one way, weather could be changing any time and I'm just tired. Dealing with some anxiety and a high stress job just isn't helping anything....",

Well I gave myself a blister.....apparently I don't have as much feeling back as I thought I did..... didn't even notice it and it doesn't hurt at all......So doc said blister has to be healed and will be checking it tomorrow. Blister popped and is now scabbed, so not sure if radiation will begin or not. Getting worried because lumpectomy was Sept. 12. Isnt there some window of opportunity for treatment?? I also took some time off work because of how far I have to drive and I work night shifts. Now my schedule is a mess, have had some nights off that I could have worked and will run short of PTO by the end of treatment, especially if delayed any longer. So frustrated, feel like thumping my head off some concrete.....",

Nothing to be done for it now, wait and see what radiation does to it and then it's 6 months before a plastic surgeon will even see you.... Sorry to hear your incision opened up. I bet that was nerve wracking.... ",

I skipped chemo, oncotype 16 All the tests on my cancer were ordered separately. First surgeon ordered a FISH test and that was in the intermediate range. Then a HER2 test, also intermediate. Then Oncologist repeated the HER2 test and when those results were negative ordered the Oncotype test. Seems like a lot of wasted time waiting for results. I am hoping they schedule treatments right away, tired of waiting, just want it done asap. Pretty sure they will think I am a pita too. No time for all this bs..",
