      "Content": "lrm2647 wrote: I am a breast cancer survior of 19 years!!  :)  Had DCIS and massectomy on right breast.  I had a mammo and ultrasound on Friday 4/3.  It was a followup from 6 months ago when they saw something that they thought was nothing but suggested checking in six months. Had 4 mammo pics, then called in for another, then called in for another. Next was an ultrasound.  The radiologist did the ultrasound and I didn't actually come out and ask her about does she think it's cancer, but after the ultrasound she said she would like to do 3 ultrasound biopsy's.  Radiologist seemed very concerned.  I've not paid much attention to breast cancer in the last ten or so years. I don't know what's out there and what has improved since 1996.  I was glad to hear when she does the core needle it is going to be by ultrasound and not mammo.  Man that was painful 20 years ago.  (19 years as of 3/20). So she made a couple comments that really have me concerned.  I have biopsy tomorrow 4/7, but as you all know, it's always on your mind and you can't turn it off.  I can't remember if this was the same site I was on back then, but I think it is. First comment is if one of the breast nodes is fibergradula(sp) the other one still needs to come out.  So does that mean she already knows or suspects it's cancer?  I'm already crying before she even said this stuff.  I just knew. Second she said that thanks to xxxxxx (tech that did mammo) we found the one that she saw now.  She did not see that 6 months ago.  Not sounding good. Third she told me there is suspicous spot on my lymph nodes?  To me that means it has spread! Fourth, on my own, I just noticed 2 weeks ago that a mole on the back of my neck that was skin color for years, is now brown. I know that nobody here is a doctor (or can't say they are), but am I reading more into all this?  I'm guessing I have 3 more days to get results of biopsy's. Has anyone ever been told there is something suspicous in their lymph nodes that was NOT cancer?   Thanks, Leeanne Log in to post a reply",

I have looked up the doctors i'm going to see and both are rated very highly, so I'm very comfortable. Just because I only got the written (electronic) copy of path, didn't know what to really research before now and even now don't know enough. I think I'm going to try and get my mind off this for another 36 hours until I see the surgeon. At least that's not that long to go, yea right!!!! Unless it's that I get to see you now, it's a long time. Have a great support system though, many family and friends behind me, so I get to vent and ask questions or whatever I want, because there is always someone a minute/phone call/text away. Just hate the waiting!! Best of luck to you!!",

Tumor 1 - invasive ductal carcinoma, nuclear grade 3, Tumor 2 - invasive carcinoma with mixed ductal and lobular features, nuclear grade 2-3, lymph node - metastatic adenocarcinoma involving lymph node. So guess I'm not doing so well. Not seeing surgeon until Wednesday and genetic testing and oncologist on Friday. Seems hard to find too much when I search for 'metastatic adenocarcinoma involving lymph node'. Does this mean both ductal and lobular are there? It's an early path test.... How much does this tell or not tell me about the spread past the nodes? Path did say i'm HER2 negative. 90% estrogen pos, 2% progesterone pos. So guess that's halfway good news (i think). I'm almost 15 years post menopausal, so doubt I'm giving out too much estrogen. I assume that means the tumor's need the estrogen to grow further/faster. I know grade 3 is bad. Six months ago we didn't even see tumor 1 or lymph's. So in some ways I think good, some ways I think not so good. Can't wait to see surgeon Wednesday but more anxious to see oncologist on Friday. Been a really rough day today. Trying to get all my legal papers together for my sister who will be beneificary. Thanks for listening!",
