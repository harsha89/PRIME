I had a breast guy do it and he saw I was upset and teriffied and it was all over in about 15 minutes.  He said to him it looks like its highly unlikely to be anything nasty but I will be nervous until I hear the news on Friday.  Well hopefully Friday, I have an appointment with the breast surgeon on Friday, but they said it could take 5 days to come back from pathology.  I will try not to get myself to worked up between now and then. Thank you again, my thoughts and prayers are with everyone. Traci. ",

Thanks, Traci. Log in to post a reply",
