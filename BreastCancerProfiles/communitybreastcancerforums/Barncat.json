We were so busy concentrating on  my right breast incision that had opened up, and I ended up in the hospital for a week, that I just thought it was a part of the scar at first.   My rash ended up being Psoriasis.  The reaction I had was refered to as Koebner phenomenon.  I had issues with Psoriasis being caused by stress in the past, but sure never thought I'd have a reaction like that on my breast!  A cortisteroid cream from my dermatologist got rid of it for me.",
