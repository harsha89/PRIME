I am so happy to have found BCO! I have read many stories and all the women here are just so strong and amazing. It really gives me hope for what is to come. I have both cried and laughed these past two days. I finally told my co-workers yesterday what I have been going thru. They couldn't believe it, and said I hid it well. I work in the medical field, and more specifically with heme/onc docs and midlevels. (my area is leukemia/lymphoma/multiple myeloma) I didn't want any of them jumping to any conclusions before testing, especially the mammo. Although breast cancer is not an area of my career, I work with wonderful docs that will refer me to the best that they know, and in that I find comfort. I already know all the RN's that work in our Cancer Center infusion area, so I know that, if the worst is to come, I am getting excellent care. Thank you for your support. I thought I was just crazy for weeks, and that I wasn't really seeing any changes in my right breast. I was in denial that I should get checked. I am so glad I did. You all are wonderful and amazing, and I thank you again.",

I'm not sure whether the breast center I had been scheduled at was equipped to do biopsies in the office.....I also have a platelet dysfunction and I need special IV meds before getting any procedure where poking and cutting are involved. That may have played a part in scheduling me with a breast surgeon also, but again, not sure. I was totally blown away with how this whole scenario has played out so far. I didn't think the worst until I got the message from the radiologist via my online patient portal email, and the phone call from my PCP's office. It was definitely a sucker punch. But that is also what brought me here. This is truly a wonderful place where amazing women with so many insights dwell. I am being way positive about this. I am bigger and better than whatever I may be facing, bad or good. I plan on being around until I'm at least 100 years old no matter what! I'm always telling patients that their attitude during treatment is a huge benefit for their treatment and quality of life.",

I know that sounds like an impossible task right now, but it is the most crucial thing you can do.   Enjoy those around you, take a deep breath, smile, laugh, and if you must....cry. But know that the doctor is doing what she can, and that testing will be done, and you will have answers.   I will b e thinking about you, and hoping that it is all good to go. Take care and I wish you nothing but good answers.               ",
