My boss is good friends with a top guy at one of the cancer treatment centers here, and since my diagnosis he has been doing a lot of reading and they are looking into the possibility of  bringing in a nutritionist to become part of the standard care there.  It seems like a no-brainer to me, especially to help those who are trying to improve their lifestyle after treatment to prevent recurrence, but maybe it is just that there isn't enough solid evidence one way or the other on so many supplements/vitamins, that they just don't feel like they can say for sure, so it's avoided.  It will be interesting to see what they discover on the topic.",
