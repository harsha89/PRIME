The doctor has referred me for an ultrasound, mammogram and biopsy, according to her she thinks the smaller lump is just fatty tissue and the larger lump she has no idea. She did worry me as she kept saying when you go to the hospital lots of people will talk to you regarding cancer",

He said nothing to me other then he will see me again on the 9th, nothing about biopsy or if he was getting the fluid checked. He mention something about how the lump filled up his whole screen he was looking at and said it was more then one lump. I'm really a little lost so think I will just have to wait until the 9th",

He just looked at the ultrasound and said 'do you mind if I put a needle in it to drain' and that was that. I feel a bit silly now I should have asked more questions but I was expecting him to say its a cyst and keep an eye on it now I'm not sure what it is. Thanks for the reply I really appreciate it and will let you know how the 9th goes",
