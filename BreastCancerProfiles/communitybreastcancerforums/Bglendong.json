Dr. told me appendix was fine, but I cyst i right breast did I know?? Well had mammogram done the next day and they told me I was fine. I told them they were wrong and to keep looking. Three mammo's later they assured me all was well and I could leave so I told them to pull up the CT scan from the hospital from the day before and then tell me all was well.  They finally located \"the mass\" and sent me to ultrasound.  There the radiologist wanted to do the biopsy so I called the GYN who ordered the mammo and she said absolutely not.  She wanted any biopsy performed by a breast surgeon.  She got me into his office the following Monday and he did core biopsies.  Now it turns out I did have breast cancer.  I had chemo, then surgery a r mastectomy with Tram flap reconstruction, then more chemo. When it came time for radiation there was some hardening on the right side so the radiation oncologisy sent me for an ultrasound and possible biopsy to ensure it was not cancer.  The radiology radiologist comes in after the tech was done and announces I need a Mammogram on my right side.  Now it was still healing from the mastectomy and I did not want to squish my beautiful reconstruction so I said\" that is impossible there is no breast there I  had a mastectomy that is all fat from my stomach\".  She says to me \"Oh know it isn't you still have a half a breast.  I remember that breast from last year because of the tattoo. OMG!  I told her I would go to my breast surgeon. Please give me copies of my films.   Moral of the story? Even though she was a doctor she clearly did not have a clue what a tram flap reconstruction was and was asking to do tests that were more harmful then necessary.  My breast surgeon did the biopsy but told me the day he did it he was 90% it was fat necrosis and it was.  So find a good breast surgeon and have them do a biopsy. There are so many treatment options out there.  ",
