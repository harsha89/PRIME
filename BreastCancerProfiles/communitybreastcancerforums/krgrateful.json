But just received my most recent letter in the mail about my insurance denying my PS claim for my usage of Alloderm on August 28th, 2007.  My experience in the year I've held this product in both my breasts (double mast, expanders, nipple repl. ...) has been great so far. No side effects that I'm aware of. Back to the letter,, the BCBS of NC is giving me notice of a grievance panel meeting for the review of my case in August of this year.  Over the past year I've received many \"COPY\"s of notifications to my PS about this.  He is a wonderful surgeon and I have the utmost respect in his work. Did my homework before I underwent surgery.   So I have no idea of what the outcome will be.. they are \"going to bat\" for me when the day comes.  I just wonder if it will be enough. I'm glad I found this site. I was sure I wasn't the only one with this dilema,,, Kim",
