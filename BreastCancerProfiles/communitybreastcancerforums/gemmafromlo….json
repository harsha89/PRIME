I had three sentinel nodes and one axial node removed (refused to give permission for full axillary clearance) but surgeon said no drains. Think it would have been better if had had one. Hope you get better soon but don't hang about - just get another opinion if you are at all worried.",

My axial inclusion burst nine days after surgery and gushed masses of seroma (which is what it is) I had to use sanitary towels to staunch the flow. The incision was restitched about three days later and massive amounts of antibiotics prescribed -phenoxymethylpenicillin 1000mg 4 times a day and Flucloxacillijn 1000mg 4 times a day for 14 days. It still leaked (much less) for a further three days or so. There was no question of draining as it had done it, although the area was swollen for quite a while. and the incision has been a real problem to heal. It is important that you keep on with antibiotics until it is healed but I do think you need to get it checked out again. All the best.",

I will ask them tomorrow if there are any male radiographers - perhaps some men would prefer them!

I have, of course, paid my share of taxes to cover the NHS which is now creaking badly with all the extra people we have drawn in and an ageing population plus all the sophisticated scans etc. which were never envisaged when it was set up in 1948. By and large I think my treatment has been first class. I am aware, however that survival is better in the US and Canada than the UK but whether that is reflection on early diagnosis with the extra mammos you have I am not sure. We tend to think here that all the visits you make are just as much a wallet lining exercise by the medical profession as made of necessity. Just what difference does it make if you see your RO every week or - as I did - not at all during treatment? (If there were problems of course she would have been available) We all know prescribing is well and truly oiled by the pharmaceuticals.. What happens to those who do not have insurance? Please tell me. Hygeia - I love the sound of growing plants - it is such a positive thing to create new life. I gave a cancer suffering friend a plant in the autumn to let her know that I was sure (not at all actually) she would be around to see it bloom in the summer. Just one other thing. WndrWoman you asked your RO about coughing . I am three weeks post rads and caught a cold last week. I have had a bad cough and my chest has been exceedingly painful all over and even down the back and I ached as much as just after surgery. It seems too to have knocked me out energywise so much so that I had a day in bed which must be the first for a cold. I was fine after rads but obviously less robust than I thought. The return to strength and wellness must be very fragile. So take care everyone.",

I think medics don't mention the bad ses in advance as it makes any woman terrified of getting them when she may well not. Newbies please note:I do not wish to crow but I finished my rads today and have very little to show for it. I was nervous that the 15 day programme might be stronger radiation but if it was it was no problem and althoughI had a 40 minute drive each way I am not fatigued. Hurray! All over and done with! What a relief! Perhaps having my treatment at one the leading cancer hospitals in the U.K paid dividends. l am not totally out of lthe woods though as the axial scar is still not completely healed (got worse during rads) but that is just a blip. Now I am being asked to restart the devil drug Femara and am not sure I can face it after all the ghastly ses I had before surgery. I stopped it due to acute knee pain which would have made the drive for rads impossible and the knee is better as are the other ses so it is a difficult decision,.
