So they wanted to rule out lupus. I got the shock of my life when I received my results. 2 nodules showed in my lungs one was 3mm and the other is 2mm. The rheumatology Nurse practitioner was not as concerned with that as she was a mass they saw in my breast that measured 1.1cm by 1.6cm. So now I go on Monday for an ultrasound and mammogram. The Nurse Practitioner said it is highly likely it is cancer. I am so freaked out! Can she tell that just by the CT scan saying a breast mass found measuring the above measurements??? Can itbe anything else?? Log in to post a reply",

He said he feels like it is benign because of its shape. He thinks it is a fibroadenoma, but he wants to do a biopsy to make sure. I go the 26th for the biopsy and the results on the 31st. I did see it on the ultrasound it was oval shape and all black. He said the way it looked was a good sign. Everyone there was amazing and caring. So now I have to wait for the biopsy and results, but I feel more positive about it now I am so glad I found this discussion board",

The radiologist told me that he doesn't remove it since its small and the biopsy confirmed it was fibroadenoma. They did put a marker on it after it was biopsied. This is so they know they biopsied it and for future screening. He just told me that it can fluctuate in size especially during your menstrual cycle. He said to make sure I am doing self breast exams, but he said since I was 37 I do not have to go for another mammogram until I am 40. I don't necessarily know if I feel comfortable with waiting until I am 40, but I do have an appointment with my doctor Monday so I will ask him about it. I do not have a history of BC in my family, but I do have other cancers in my family. I actually went for a CT scan of my chest for some other health issues I am having and that's how they found the mass. Did the radiologist tell you they think it is a fibroadenoma? When are you suppose to get your results? I am praying for the best for you. Keep me updated and let me know if you have any other questions.",
