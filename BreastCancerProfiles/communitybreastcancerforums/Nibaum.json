If you are interested, the article cited this study which discusses the differences between HR- and HR+ in HER2 positive BC: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262265734_Two_histopathologically_different_diseases_Hormone_receptor-positive_and_hormone_receptor-negative_tumors_in_HER2-positive_breast_cancer It found a correlation between HR+ and lower grade and less aggressive tumors.  I guess I am frustrated that we are not at the point that we can use this information to guide treatment yet.  But I think future triple positive BC survivors will eventually get the appropriate level of treatment.   ",

It was the 3 weeks between my surgery and the second opinion consult with NCI MO that pushed everything back.  Initially, my case seems pretty straightforward and TCH was going to be my treatment plan.  Perhaps my treating MO should have questioned the initial HER2 result, promptly ordered a 2nd FISH test for confirmation and I wouldn't be under this time constraint.  I will re-read your post more carefully and read the links you provided.  Thank you!",

BarredOwl - My sense is that NCI MO does not think the Oncotype DX is valid for HER2+.  After my second FISH came back positive, she immediately recommended Taxol/Herceptin as the treatment even though she knew that I was still waiting for the Oncotype result.  When I asked her if my Grade 1 and highly HR+ tumor warranted a lighter chemo, such as Navelbine, she pointed out that 10% of patients  of the 400 patients in the Taxol/Herceptin study by Dana Farber had grade 1 tumors.  I was very discouraged because my treating MO is even more conservative and by the book (i.e. NCNN guidelines).  The  DF study did not specify the size or the ER/PR status of those with grade 1 tumors.  Thank you!  You put into words my vague concern that I can't even use a low Oncotype score to forgo chemo, even if  my MO was willing to treat me with Herceptin only.  I am hoping the results for the phase 2  Herceptin only trial  for those over age 65 will come out soon.  At the very least, if I am struggling with Taxol, my MO and I can have some assurance that Herceptin only is still helpful.  I have Thalassemia (anemia) and Raynauds syndrome on my right hand.  So I may not be able to get my red blood cells back up and may be more prone to neruopathy.  Otherwise I have no other known health issues that would contraindicate chemo. Although I read Aetna's guidelines for Oncotype DX, which state that only HER2+  tumors that are 1 cm or less would be covered.  Aetna is pretty conservative in what tests they consider medically necessary so there must be some precedent for the Oncotype DX test for early HER2+ cases.  Aetna considers Mammaprint and all other genetic assays experimental since they are not in the NCNN guidelines. So my thinking now is to proceed with the weekly Taxol/Herceptin treatment and if my Oncotype score comes back low, I may have to pay for a Mammaprint on my own if I want a clearer picture of my risk.  I really appreciate everyone's input!",

Not that I am not even thinking of foregoing Herceptin based treatment, but was hoping I could get it with a lighter non-taxane chemo.  Unfortunately, we are just not there yet with more target therapies.

Special K - On both my first pathology and 2nd pathology, the overall grade was 1.  On the first it was 4/9 (1 nuclear grade, 2 tubular formation, 1 mitotic index).  The 2nd NCI pathologist (who is a very experienced) scored it 5/9 (2 nuclear grade, 2 tubular shape, 1 mitotic index).  But the 2nd pathology review had more details on the mitotic index, with a 0 mf/ 10 hpf,  which I think is as low as it can go.  I realize that another part of the tumor may show something else but it made me doubt chemo even more.  So at least the Oncotype DX will factor in Ki67, which is another proliferation marker.  Genomics Health said they won't give the Ki67 separately in my report.  But if I get a low RS score, then I would know my Ki67 was on the low end.  If my RS score is mid to high, then the Ki67 was likely on the higher end.  As for the Mammaprint test, I guess the timeframe to get it done seems to be too late.  Plus my insurance won't cover it, so its $5000 out of pocket, which is cost prohibitive for me at this point.  And if the Oncotype score comes back intermediate or high, then chemo/Herceptin is pretty much a given.  Its only if the Oncotype score comes back low that I will have be faced with a real dilemma. Thank you for helping me understand this  conundrum!",
