I've been having right rib pain and pain under my ribcage. My stomach bloats like crazy after I eat anything and I am extremely nauseous. I've lost two pounds in the last week. My CT and sono show what is believed to be 3 liver cysts and 1 hemangioma. All three cysts are over 1.5cm and the hemangioma is 1.7cm. I had X-rays of the ribs and that came back fine. They are scheduling me a PET scan. I can not have a MRI due to my expanders. Anyone with liver mets have anything like this happen? I'm trying to decide if I need to get a second opinion. The pain is insane.",
