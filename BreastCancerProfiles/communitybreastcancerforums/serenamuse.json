I ended up fainting when they inserted the needle, knocked it about, woke up lying on a flat table with three people hovered over me. The wire itself wasn't an issue really, getting it in there...My surgical biopsy did not go well. They lost the metal clip (marker) and could not find it in any of the towels or containers so went back into me digging around for it, brought in another surgeron to also dig around, brought in a large x ray machine (flouroscope?) and determined that they did get it out, but still needed to find it. So, I was on the table an hour longer than expected with a larger incision and much more invasive digging. They finally found the clip in the canister of blood where they did their original suction (I guess there was more blood that usual, probably from my fainting and messing with the needle, I assume). I am in week three and am still in a lot of discomfort - itchy, achy pain, exhaustion and just emotionally unstable. I really think the anasthesia did a number on me. I don't know how people go back to work so soon. I think though that we all respond differently and have different pain levels, and deal with the drugs differently.",
