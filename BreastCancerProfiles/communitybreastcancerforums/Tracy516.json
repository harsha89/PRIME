I had a gyn appt so I waited another week! Sure enough she sent me for a full diagnostic mammo. Last year GYN thought she felt a lump but mammo showed nothing! Maybe this wAs nothing? Mammo and ultra sound concluded that yes there isa lump. BDr. Says at 1st appt in May \"lets biopsy\" right there and then. A week later DCIS! No one in my family has either! Until now! And plans for lumpectomy and SLN biopsy on July 16! I'm a week in and it still a hurts some;( Follow up and pathology on Wednesday! Scared!

With my mother-in-law who is a Breast Cancer Surviver 9 years (no mastecomy).Â  I just keep thinking this isn't real. My breast look fine!..ok so the one has tumors that I can't see, but the other is in perfect shape for an overweight 41 year old mother of two! No gene testing but doesnt matter because I already have it! My daughter will have to be on top of it though and i want to be there for her! So the breast don't really matter to me. I just dont want to be jumping the gun here for my other breast. The only problem with that is the gun goes off with no warning. I don't want to be here in 5 years having my \"Good\" breast \"infected\" with cancer and my mind right back to all of this! NOW its time to just see the PS and see what surgery would be good for me!",
