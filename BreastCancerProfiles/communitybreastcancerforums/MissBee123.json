      "Content": "Oct 24, 2015 08:13AM - edited Oct 24, 2015 08:14AM by MissBee123 Hello Holly and welcome! I had a head shaving party, too, and it was quite fun! I waited until mine began to fall out, however, I think there are benefits and drawbacks to both. Most people lose their hair pretty consistently between days 14-16. By then, in general (if you're having treatment every 3 weeks), you are feeling pretty good. If that's not your regimen and you're on weekly treatments, you might feel differently. The drawback to waiting is that your hair will begin to fall out pretty quickly and it may be hard to plan a party last-minute. For me, day 14 my hair was intact and strong. Day 15 I woke up and when I ran a brush through my hair all of it came out. My parents were due to arrive in town for my next chemo and head shaving party two days later. I ended up pinning my hair in a little bun and then threw a scarf on. For the next two days I didn't touch my hair so that it would last, but it was ready to jump off my head by the time the party arrived. The drawback to doing it beforehand is you may be one of the people who doesn't lose their hair. Some women only experience mild thinning and it might be sad to cut your hair off for no reason. If your hair doesn't fall out, then you will find the stubble growing back pretty quickly. The upside to doing it before chemo, of course, is that it allows you to be in control. For me, I was fine with losing my hair, but many women find it deeply upsetting. If you feel attached to your hair and know you might have this type of reaction, doing it earlier may help. Either way, having a party is a blast. My mom even made t-shirts for everyone at the party, which was really fun. I had a friend video it for me. If you'd like to watch it, it's here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQwMLNn8k-k (I never want to feel self-promoting on this site, please only watch if it would be helpful, no pressure!) Good luck!",

I am BRCA negative but I am positive for a mutation that causes thyroid cancer (NRAS) and have a nodule on my thyroid that twice has come back as \"inconclusive\". Because of this they are doing further genetic testing to see if there are any other mutations that possibly link thyroid and breast cancer. If it comes back positive, I have to have a bilateral. If negative, unilateral. I'm really struggling with all of this because I am fairly young (32) and have no interest in removing my breasts; frankly, I really like them! I pushed and pushed for a lumpectomy but in the end there are too many concerns to justify doing only that. My chemotherapy did not work and they stopped me after my 3rd treatment to move forward with surgery. Some moments I feel fine but at other times I find myself bursting into tears. I guess that comes with the territory of all this, but I feel like I handled everything else well. This just seems to be the hardest part. Glad to have this forum and others to reach out and connect with people. Will be thinking of all my \"surgery sisters\" this coming month.",

Beth: there are quite a few lesser known genes linked to breast cancer. In addition to BRCA 1 and 2 I was also tested for: ATM, BARD1, BRIP1, CDH1, CHEK2, MRE11A, MUTYH, NBN, NF1, PALB2, PTEN, RAD50, RAD51C, RAD51D, and TP53. I found out today I am positive for RAD50, which is linked to both breast and ovarian cancer. Because of this, my surgeon and I have agreed to go forward with a bilateral mastectomy with DIEP flap reconstruction using abdomen and thigh tissue. It's quite the surgery (12 hours!!!) but it's a one and done deal, I won't have to endure any further breast procedures, which I am very happy about. I think I'll be the first one in this thread to go through surgery on Monday so I'll be our unofficial guinea pig and report back to all of you! cjafarm: I'm definitely surgery nesting :)",

As one of the first this month, I still promise it does get better! I had my 7th and final drain removed 2 weeks post-op, as well as the stitches on my thighs. Having both those out has made me feel human again. Still tough to sit on a toilet, but I'm working on it! Gearing up for surgery #2 to remove my thyroid on December 11th. I'll see my oncologist on Dec 2nd and he will tell me if I am to have more chemotherapy. If he wants it, I'll be in the unique situation of having both neoadjuvent and adjuvent chemo. Healing mostly well, but man oh man is my skin sensitive where the nerves are reconnecting. My chest above my breasts is the worst, I can barely tolerate any touch and my clothes rubbing on it is the worst. My arm is much better, though, and my stomach is slowly improving but still mostly numb. Right thigh is still numb and left thigh is back to normal. Very interesting to observe this healing process. I went back to work this week. Short hours, but it's nice to see everyone again and gives me something to do other than Netflix! I hope you all have a wonderful Thanksgiving. Eat a little extra pie this year; we earned it!",

My advice so far is you might be very nauseous when you first awake die to the anesthesia so don't be afraid to take meds for it. Day 1 was the worst for getting up but I honestly think it was worth it since today was so much better. I'm also trying to stay ahead of the pain with meds and it really has helped.  Hard to write and check in here but I have 3 more days in the hospital so I'll be sure to check in again. Best of luck to you all! BTW, My boobs look GREAT!!!",

I'm finally coming back into the land of the living and wanted to give you all a few updates. I had a whopping 7 drains post my 12.5 hour DIEP PAP flap surgery: 2 thigh, 2 abdomen, 1 L breast, 2 R breast. The last of the drains (right thigh) just came out yesterday. I didn't take much notice when my friend initially told me this but you will feel SO much better once your drains are out. I didn't realize how much they were truly impacting me until I had them removed. I also had my thigh stitches pulled out yesterday and made up about 60 new swear words during the process. Of all the things that have happened so far, getting the stupid stitches out was the worst! I've started physical therapy with a good friend who is helping me with range of motion and getting my arms/abs/legs back into shape. I knew I would be hunched over due to the \"tummy tuck\" but I didn't realize how much I was protecting my legs, too, and ended up with steel hamstrings. My appetite came back after about a week. The anesthesia really does a number on your stomach. I first woke up from surgery and they said, \"Brenna, how do you feel?\" Before I could answer I promptly threw up. I had to take nausea meds along with everything else for awhile. I was also given valium because I started to have rather violent muscle twitches at bedtime. I actually nearly threw myself out of the hospital bed and kicked my leg over my head! I no longer need either and am down to my last few percocet, which I save for early morning stiffness or traumatic events like stitches removal. My husband and I are closer than ever. That man has now changed multiple bed pans and helped me \"remember\" how to pee...a skill that took about a week to return to normal. I would feel that I had to go, sit there, try to use those muscles, and nothing would happen. Each time I had to go it took about 5 minutes to get things working. The first day after surgery they made me get up and wanted me to go for a walk. I got out of bed, broke out in full body sweat head to toe, and made it to the door. They sent me back to bed after that but the next day I did get up and went for a little walk. I make myself walk every day and am up to an hour, though I still need naps. If you want to see my inaugural walk, check it out. I call myself The Blur! Sending all my love to each of you! ",

I think worrying that I will regret a decision is definitely one of the hardest parts, since there is no going back, but your advice is a great perspective. Good luck with your upcoming procedure! Truffles: I knew my stage and grade based on my MRI and PET scan. Based on that they were able to measure my tumor and see which lymph nodes appeared enlarged. Although not as precise as a true biopsy, the measurement of a 4cm tumor and affected lymph nodes put me in Stage IIB, although my oncologist said it could turn out to be a higher stage once they biopsy. BCO has a great resource explaining each stage. If you know your tumor measurement and whether the lymph nodes are involved, you can probably ascertain your stage: http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/diagnosis/staging",

      "Content": "Oct 20, 2015 08:01PM MissBee123 wrote: Hello Ladies, What wonderful stories you all have to share about your children. I am a special education teacher and I work with children who have profound delays, both mentally and physically. One thing I know is that, for my children with special needs, visual aids can be a WONDERFUL tool to help them comprehend what is happening. What comes to mind immediately for me is making a small book that can explain your illness and treatment in a way they can understand. The book could also address questions they may have. For example: Page 1: What is happening to Mom? Mom has an illness called breast cancer. Cancer is a small growth in our body that happens when our healthy cells start to grow too quickly.  Page 2: What is the doctor doing to help my mom get better? Cancer can be treated many ways. There are four common treatments and your mom's doctor will help decide what is best for her. 1. Chemotherapy (key-mow-ther-uh-pee) : Chemotherapy is a medicine, like a shot, that goes into a person's body and kills the cancer. 2. Surgery (sir-jur-ee): Surgery is performed by a special doctor, called a surgeon. A surgeon will use special tools to remove the cancer from a person's body. (Here I would give an example of how we cut the dark spots off a banana or apple with a knife, leaving the healthy part of the fruit behind) 3. Radiation (ray-dee-a-shun): Radiation is a special machine that sends invisible waves into a person's body to kill cancer. The waves cannot be seen and do not hurt. 4. Pills: There are medicines that come in pill form and are taken every day. These medicines can help keep cancer from coming back.  Page 3: I'm scared. Is my mom going to die? It is normal to feel scared when someone you love is sick. Although your mom is sick, she and her doctors are working all the time to help make her healthy again. There may be times when your mom does not look well: she might have bandages, bruises, a wheelchair, or even throw up. It can be scary to see, but it will not last and she will get better. (Again, I would bring up a time when your child was sick and then got better. This page, of course, may need tweaking if a parent is dealing with a terminal illness or unclear prognosis.)  Page 4: How can I help my mom? There are lots of ways to help people who have cancer. Some ideas are: 1. Cancer treatment can make people tired. You can help by cleaning your room, setting the table, and keeping the house neat. If you have a pet, ask your parent if you can help by walking or feeding your animal. 2. Sometimes people with cancer can feel a little worried or sad. This is normal. Your mom might enjoy doing special things with you to cheer her up. Offer to sit and watch a movie, make her a card, or share a favorite meal. The most important thing to your mom is knowing that YOU are happy. Make sure to keep doing the things that make you happy, too: visit you friends, play a sport, and go to school. (Talk about other things your child might like to do)  Okay, that was just off the cuff and I'm sure you could personalize something like this to fit your child specifically, making the language as complex or simple as you like. I would include photos of each of you on different pages, both together and apart. Take a picture of your doctors, include their names, and explain to your child who is on your care team. Take a picture of you in an exam gown at the doctor. Giving a face and a name to each of these things will help them process. Having a book like this will allow your child to repeatedly revisit these facts that they may need to hear again and again (especially children with DS and ASD). I hope that was helpful. If anyone wants to send me a PM, I'm happy to help more. You are all incredible parents and I wish each of you the best!",

A healthy diet will certainly help in general, but I was not unhealthy to begin with. It's almost insulting, like an insinuation that if you had taken \"perfect\" care of yourself you would be cancer free. Had a second friend tell me all I needed was baking soda and lemon juice. That's it! No chemo! No surgery! No radiation! At this point, I just smile and thank them for the advice. It's not worth the energy to argue or debate.",
