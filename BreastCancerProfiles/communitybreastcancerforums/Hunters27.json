I though it would be something and nothing as it was so tiny, like a ball bearing size. The lump it just under the skin and there is an indent on the skin and slight mark on the skins surface. I saw a doctor a few weeks later as it was not going away and he told be from feeling it that it was a sebaceous cyst and that they would remove it under local anaesthetic. I have now been waiting for over 2 months but still no appointment and whilst I am sure he\u2019s right, it has not been tested so part of me wonders how he can be so sure. I did get a second opinion when I went to another doctor about something else so I thought I would ask them while I was there but she just said the other doctor is a dermatologist so he knows what he\u2019s talking about. I really don\u2019t want to cause a fuss for no reason or wast any valuable NHS time so I wondered if anyone else has had a sebaceous cyst on the breast as o cannot find much online about sebaceous breast cycsts Thanks all Sam Log in to post a reply",
