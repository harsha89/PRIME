Am not going to have reconstructiion. Am so scared about surgery, what will happen if I cannot quit smoking before surgery (I have not had one in 3 days but cannot stand it as I am so scared) my new husband of 2 years is loving and devestated and I dont know how to console him. I am too scared to have recon as dr said my skin is thin, may rip during the stretching, the implants might break and have all this stuff leaking into my body. But I cannot even imagine how my husband will even want to be physically near me. After, I will look like a boy. It's just horrible. Please share some good news with me. Anyone. Did anyone smoke up until the surgery? My dr said I need to be smoke free for 3 weeks prior to this double masectomy or I could have a heart attack or a stroke on the table.",
