Are you eeady to share my news? In July 2012 I had breast cancer. I had cancer removed. chemo and control with tablets. Everything went very well until November 2013 I went back for my check up I found another lump and turn out to be another cancer at the same breast. At that time I was scared and can't hear what doctor told me at all as a bit shock and only in my head was thinking I am going to die. But I am still here. I had another cancer removed. mastectomy and reconstruction in January 2014. After that I had a little lump nearly edge of my breast where I had reconstruction. I went back to breast clinic. Doctor told me that it look like fat lump from reconstruction. So I did not think anything much but carry on with my life. Until few weeks ago I went for my normal check up at oncology clinic. Doctor noticed this lump and advised me to go back to breast clinic to check again. Here we go, yesterday I saw doctor, I had ultrasounds and biopsy in that lump and under my arm. I will go back on Monday for result. At this point you will think I am very braved as for all a long what I have been through and I am still look after myself very well. I wrote a book, I gave so many friends and family advised about how to cope with cancer, how I get through, how important people needed to support each otherside. How to survive and beat the cancer together. I have so much energy and wanted to tell everyone that don't give up. Feel positive. Last night I cannot sleep. My head gone backward forward. So many questions in my head. I come back to the same feeling in 2912 again. I cannot wait til Monday. Why so long. Waiting time is the worst one than anything. Please can someone tell me if you ever heard the fatty lump there can be a cancer? Or the lump under arm can be a cancer? Thank you so much. Chayada xx Log in to post a reply",
