    "Content": "Apr 5, 2008 07:29PM - edited Apr 5, 2008 07:30PM by BrookeL I will be joining the chemo group on April 10th.  I found a lump high on my left breast in December and had a mammogram the next day---nothing showed up on the mammogram. My physician called a month later to see if the lump was still there and said to call if it was increasing in size or still there in a month. Yep, it was still there in February. I was referred to a sugeon who removed the lump a few days later. On February 28th, I was surprized to hear that it was cancer--no history in my family of it. So, after a biopsy, lumpectomy, and some lymphnodes removed, I've had a port implanted, and I hope I'm ready for this. I'm pretty much tired of the \"cutting stage\". I don't have all the cancer lingo down yet, but what I know is that I had a 2cm lump removed along with about 22 lymphnodes--about 1 or 2 had cancer in them.  I also had some ductal carcinoma insitu. I'm Er-/Pr-/HER+. So, I'll be doing A/C and Herceptin as well as radiation. I have a great oncologist with a very positive staff. I feel pretty positive about my treatment plan that has been explained to me.  I feel blessed to have a supportive family, co workers, and friends around me. I just hope that I'll be able to continue to work the next 9 weeks--I'm a teacher.  Anyway, I wish the best for all of you these next few months. We'll hang in there together!!!!",
