That made no sense to me because - due to the test results - I didn't have to have chemo, so it obviously saved them money. But in any event, Agendia (the company that gives the test) has a deal where if the insurance company won't pay, they will settle with you for $500, and they will work out a payment plan. I ended up paying it off over a few months (without interest). They were really easy to deal with. While I am also terrified about the chance of recurrence, I'm thrilled that I didn't have to have chemo. The long-term effects of chemo can be so devastating.",
