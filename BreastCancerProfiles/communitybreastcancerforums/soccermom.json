I am a recovered lymphadema patient, now almost 5 years post DX. Mine was very much stress related and once I got through my divorce and all my treatment ( which included a year of herceptin post-surgery and chemo) mine gradually improved. I think it also helped that I educated myself about what to avoid and self-massage. I did not have ssevere swelling but I did have severe discomfort and throbbing when the stress level rose. At times I wondered if life would ever return to \"normal\". I thought it was encouraging to meet someone who had adapted her lifestyle to cope with lymphadema by receiving SSI and having a service dog to help keep her calm. to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free Dx 10/20/2003, IDC, <1cm, Stage IIA, Grade 2, 2/12 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

I remember how debilitatingÂ lymphadema was and feel very blessed that mine gradually abated. Thank you everyone who shared their experiences and links. bygrace1- how long have you been retired on disability? maybe eventually things will lessen now that you are able to take care of yourself better??",
