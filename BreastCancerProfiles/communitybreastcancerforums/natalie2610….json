On my right lower limb you can hardly tell anything, and my left lower limb is mediocre seize...it's mostly at my feet and calf so you can hardly notice  ,Im just really into taking care of it treatments weize because I want  it to be better to non existence As for the donor site - I have a small unnoticeable scar on my right axilla - 2 sm long, And on my recipient site - I have a 4 sm scar on my inner left thigh, looks like the skin is hilling good, as for pain - no special pains or pain reliefs needed  , I feel fine About  staying in the hospital 4 days after my surgery , as I explained , this is the first time Israeli hospital has done this procedure even though it was done by the top surgeon Dr. Corrine Becker, so the Israeli plastic surgeons that attended my operation  wanted to be on the safe side\u2026 Why aren't u having an MRL \u2013 lymphografy insted of an MRI ? That\u2019s the best exam for this kind of operation Keep me posted, best of  luck for now",

I have done it Met Dr Corinne Becker (from Paris) and Dr josh Levin (from New York) Both plastic surgeons last week on the 11th, at Tel Aviv health center - Israel And after meeting with them had the Surgery on the 14th Along with me there where 4 other Israelis patients that had undergo this procedure as well- 2 woman who had had breast cancer and 2 others like me with primary lymphdema at there lower limbs Along with Becker and josh Levin there where other Israelis doctors in the operating room \u2013that watched dr becker's and levin's work , the whole thing took about 2 and a half hours They took 4 nodes close to my right chest line (near my right exile) and put it above my left knee \u2013 since from my left feet and calf up to my left knee is most of my problem I was at the hospital since the day of my surgery 14th \u2013 Wednesday till Sunday and now I am home I feel o.k. \u2013 off course I have to rest all day long with my feet up, the places where they took the nodes from\u2013 looks like a very small cut \u2013 and I hope it will scar well, also where they put them does not look big at all, so I'm not worried about the scaring\u2013 after all they are plastic surgeons..:)  It will take about a month until I will go back to normal activity Dr Becker explained me that the nodes that were transplanted have to \"get used to their new home\" at my knee And after a month they will start growing lymfh vessel's about one millimeter a day \u2013 so it will take up to six months until I will see an improvement and about 2 years to final results I will have to continue MLD as usual (physiotherapy) and bandaging as if I hadn\u2019t done any surgery for the next 2 years. On 13 of February I will fly off to Paris for a check up \u2013 and meet with dr Becker again. There I will have an MRL-lymphgraphy(the special MRI trisha was talkin about on her writing's above) it's an exam that  among other can show you how much lymph vessels have grown from the new lymph nodes \u2013 here in Israel we don\u2019t have it yet , but I know in New York you have it already \u2013 so no need for you folks to fly off to Paris That\u2019s all for now Very happy how every thing turned out- I consider it my own private miracle, I guess I was at the right place at the right time can't wait to see what will come of it  ",

About the elastic garments and compressive compressions , up until today I walked all day with elastic stocking that were especially ordered and cut for me, By \" JOBST\"company, it\u2019s a germen company , very known for its stockings , so You might have heard of it , as I said my problem is at my feet and calf area so I could ware elastic stockings until the knee, leaving my thighs free of elastic stockings , now after I had the surgery , Dr Becker explained me I will have to ware an elastic stocking until my inguinal area on my operated limb , and on my right limb I can stay with the same elastic stockings as I had before, since im fanatic about taking care of my legs , I always buy a very high comp ration level \u2013 meaning 3+ , dr Becker said there's no need for that on my operated limb since to much pressure on the operated area will not benefit it , so I should ware an elastic stockings with comp ration rate 2..and that\u2019s  what I ordered, so this time I bought MEDIVEN since its so much thinner than jobst and has nicer feel on my skin, I wanted to find something very comfortable since it will take me some adjustment time to get used to going with a full elastic stoking until the inguinal area, on my right leg I continue to go with \"JOBST\" cause it\u2019s a very thick and efficient stockings to patients who like high compration on their LE limb. As for night time \u2013 I do self MLD each night, and wrap my self with compressive compressions \u2013 I know its a lot of work, and that today there are More easy and quick compressions such as \"Ferro rap\", but I prefer the old fashion way of bandaging, also my physiotherapist says it\u2019s the best effective one for treating lymphdema and that after all is the most important thing anyway happy to inform you my physiotherapist attended my surgery as well , observing it all , and also other well known physiotherapist from here were in the other 4 patients surgeries\u2026I think the same as you , if I can help give information about this procedure to fellow patients physiotherapist ect. Why not? About the lymph press, though im young J I guess im an old fashion girl, I believe in self MLD and compressive compressions as much more efficient then other possibilities so I stick to that, I have not tried \"lymph press \" ever and frankly im al littlie afraid of it, as I heard it could do harm to the remaining nodes in the LE area  Very happy to hear you are also having it done soon, I understand Dr.Becker, is due to arrive to New York on December, to operate patients, will she be attending your operation as well? Best of luck for now  Keep me informed Natalie    ****************************** Nordy - tnx for the warm wishes I Will  keep u updated",
