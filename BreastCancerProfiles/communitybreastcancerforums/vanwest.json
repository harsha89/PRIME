I am 55 years old and I have a pea sized lump in my left breast which I discovered three months ago. I went to my internist and she said \"it's probably a cyst\". As it did not go away I went to my daughter's obgyn. She felt it and said we need to see what this is. I went for a mammogram and an ultrasound this am and was told that both tests showed nothing. I felt good at first but now I don't know what I should do next. I'm really concerned because the lymphnode near my collarbone has been swelling off and on for about 4 months plus I have a rash that breaks out grows larger then goes away only to return in another area of my body. Forgive me for being long winded but I don't understand how we can feel a pea sized lump that doesn't show up on the tests. I've been told that my breast are very dense..this makes me even more concerned. Log in to post a reply",

When the lump didn't show up on the mammogram or the ultrasound I was so confused and thought maybe I am over reacting....but there is a little voice in my head that keeps saying \"what if\". My doctor is out of the office until Thursday. When I speak with her I will ask to be referred to a breast surgeon. Thank you for your  response....I will not wait on this...hopefully everything is fine but you are right, I need to determine what it is!",
