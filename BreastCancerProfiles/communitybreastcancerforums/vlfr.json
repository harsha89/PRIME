I keep hearing this one is better as far as nasea and fatigue. I sure hope so because I am going to receive chemo every week for 12 weeks. I feel like making big X's on the calendar to get thru to the end of April. I'm with Viddie about people putting you in a bad place. I hate going for treatment becuase almost everyone in the Cancer Center is far worse off than I preceive I am. The thought of a reaccurance has made me lose sleep more than once.",
