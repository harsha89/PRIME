I worry about who's going to take care of them. For the first week after diagnosis, I was very depressed, crying a lot and worried about how soon my death will come. Now after doing some research and finding this site, I am more optimistic that I can fight this cancer! Definitely hearing these stories of all these ladies has given me much hope! Thank you strong ladies!",
