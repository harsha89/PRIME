Wish I could taste the coffee in the AM though!!  I read that quite a few of you took control with the hair thing and felt good about cutting and or shaving it. I believe I am going to do the same. I have had very long thick hair since childhood and do not think I can bear seeing it fall out over time. I am so thankful for all of you sharing your experiences and life paths during this very challenging time in our lifes. My hat of to all you wonderful people!!  I keep telling myself that all the side effects is the chemos way of letting me know it is working!!!!",

I am having a very hard time wearing hats. My scalp is just too itchy and I started a rash. Any one else who has the same problem? Any suggestions?. What is this leg hair thing?? One would think you would get a break not having to shave. You lose your hair of your head and everywhere else but not your legs? What gives. Also any of you having problems with weight gain? I seem to have slight swelling in my hands and my abdomen seems larger. Otherwise my energy has returned and I am looking forward for a better week. Sending all you angels \"feel good\" vibes, Johanna",
