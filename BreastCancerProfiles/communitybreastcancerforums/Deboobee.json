    "Content": "Deboobee wrote: I am 3 months post double mastectomy and reconstruction. I have continued to have 30 to 50 Ccs of drainage on the breast that underwent lumpectomy, sentinel node biopsy,mastectomy and reconstruction. The other breast is fine. First the drains were pulled one week postop, then drainage continued on the one side. I had to get it drained every 2 to 4 days (aspirated with needle. Ouch. Then he put drain in after 2 months.Then he revised both my lumpectomy and mastectomy incisions. Then my expanders sprung a leak. Then I had surgery to replace expander, put in new drain and use allograft to reinforce incisions. It's been a week since this last procedure and I'm draining about 20 to 30 Ccs I feel trapped, losing faith and discouraged. How long might this continue? Log in to post a reply",
