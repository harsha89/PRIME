I started that about a year ago when studies came out indicating that low vitamin D levels might contribute to late onset metastasis, and of course I found out my levels were very low. Other than that, and buying cancer insurance last year, I honestly just live life and don't really worry about it anymore. If it comes back, I'll worry about it then, but only if that happens. This has been much easier to do as the years have gone by of course - I couldn't even say metastatis for a long time, out of fear of somehow jinxing myself. I still make it a point to come back every year and post here, because I remember how much it helped me in the beginning, and it allowed me to start thinking, why couldn't that be me too? üòä",
