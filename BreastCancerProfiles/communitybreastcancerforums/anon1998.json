This was my first concern as it is extremely abnormal for me. Second concern is I have noticed a few blue veins on both breasts. I have never noticed them before. My collarbone used to be sort of prominent and now you can barely my collarbone. I can't really feel a lump which makes me think that it's nothing. I genuinely don't know what I should do. Just wondering if anyone had any advice or experienced same symptoms. Log in to post a reply",
