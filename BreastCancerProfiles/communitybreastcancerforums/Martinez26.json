Then today I noticed a purple spot on one of my vains on my right breast I think it might of been red at one point because all the dots look identical in size and shape.. My breast have been hurting and feel fatigue I'm worried sick reading all these articles online please help. :/ None of my family memebers that I know of has had Any type of cancer.
