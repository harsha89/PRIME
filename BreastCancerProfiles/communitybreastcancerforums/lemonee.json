I'll get my results next Tuesday and have set up my appointment for the treatment plan. I just feel numb and am so scared that I waited too long to get this checked. I'm so worried that it might be late stage.",

      "Content": "lemonee wrote: Hello all. I've been having a pinching/burning pain in one breast for a long time,but since I'm in my late 40s I thought it was probably due to hormonal changes from perimenopause. Then I found a lump and went for an examination. I was very negligent and hadn't had an exam for 8 years before that. The gynecologist sent me for a diagnostic mammogram and an ultrasound. Before leaving, I was told I would have my results in 48-72 hours. Instead, within 10 minutes of leaving the office, I got a call from my doctor's office saying the radiologist called and said I had a \"grape-sized suspicious mass\" and that they set up an appointment for the next week for an ultrasound-guided biopsy and breast-care consultation with the radiologist and surgeon. I haven't gotten the official results of the mammogram/ultrasound and I'm not sure if I will get them before going for the biopsy this coming Thursday. I just don't know how worried I should be...

I hope all your test results were good ones. Wishing you the best!",

I wore ice packs pretty much nonstop for two days or so. I have had bruising and soreness, but my mass was already painful to begin with. The technician and radiologist were great. They casually talked to me about the weather and the upcoming holidays all the way through, along with explaining every step. I hope you have a smooth experience too. One tip: I don't like needles or anything invasive, so I always make sure to avert my eyes during procedures of any type. Ignorance is bliss in those situations for me. Lol",
