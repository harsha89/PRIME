In 70-80% of these cases it is nothing more and they will monitor you for 2-5 years by doing diagnostic mammograms yearly and I will see both my OB/GYN and Breast Surgeon. If I am one of the 20-30% this last biopsy will come back as DCIS. ADH puts you at a higher risk for developing Breast Cancer in the next 10-15 years supposedly which is why they will monitor me more closely.  I had some tenderness in my left breast and I am 99% positive it was in the spot where they took the last biopsy from, I can feel where they took the tissue. That is making me slightly more nervous. They told me I wouldn't have felt the area of calcifications however in those cases where they find DCIS after finding ADH it is because they take a larger chunk and the cancer is surrounding the ADH, or that is how I read it and why they do the excision biopsy when they find ADH. As for your biopsy, I HIGHLY recommend you get some ativan. Also bring your iPod and listen to something mellow... I had my iPhone with me and just turned on itunes and relaxed a bit more. I used the phones speakers and the doctor was fine. But then I put on Natalie Merchant and she liked the music so... Perhaps if I had chosen my Nickleback playlist she would have felt differently. They didn't give me any painkillers for after but they would have been nice the first day, and expect bruising.... My incision from that surgery is still scabbed and not quite healed, possibly because the needle? I have no idea, it seems I am scabbing quicker with this last one and it is healing at a quicker rate. ",

The biggest issue I had was being on that bed and the bruising afterwards. I was still yellowish when I went in for my excision biopsy two weeks later. I highly recommend something especially if you are doing the stereotactic. Also, when they are doing it, ask them to allow one of your arms through the hole if they can. This made it a little more comfortable for me... ",

I am normally a sensible person but since this started a month ago I have been a basket case. I have started just taking a few minutes to just breathe. I am also trying to remember that even with the worst case scenario of it being cancer, we caught and it survivable. The proof is on these boards.

Anyway, I did the diagnostic then a stereotactic core needle biospy? Is this what they are doing for you? I was a nervous wreck for sure before that one. Lying on a table on my belly for 40 minutes without moving was stressing me out. I had the results of that in 2 days. They think it was ADH, so last Monday I had an excisional biopsy and am now waiting for the results. I think that is definitely the hardest part, the waiting game is horrible. I am sending good vibes down to Houston for you though :-)  Remember too, it is a small cluster and they can grab it out of there quick even if it cancer...  I am a little relieved knowing they took a walnut size chuck out of me and whatever it is, is gone from my body.... Patriotic, you just scared me more!!! Even though they said the first biopsy was ADH, I have been scared it is DCIS, since 20-30% of the time that is what comes back the second go round. It is just  a small cluster and nothing else showing on the mammogram... Oh well, you are right, even if comes back as DCIS I have options.. And if doesn't I will breathe a sigh of relief and celebrate on Thursday night... Oh and apologize to my fiance and everyone else for being such a basket case!! LOL ",

As she kept reminding me, I DO NOT HAVE CANCER. I do however have ADH, which was removed June 6. This puts me at a higher risk for developing BC along with other factors. The subject of Tamoxifen was brought up, I was told to take a few months and think about it. As it would decrease my risk of developing cancer by 50%. I have a 27% chance of developing BC in my lifetime at this stage. So that would bring me down to a 13% chance. I believe the average is 11 or 12% for the general population, therefore leaving me at a higher risk anyway. The risks of tamoxifen include Deep Vein Thrombosis (blood clots), pulmonary embolisism, a list of other side effects. With the ADH before the excisional biopsy my risk of it being cancer was 30%. It came back B9... So here is my thought, do I take a medication that could cause me to have a stroke in order to decrease my chances of developing cancer, or do I take my chances?  I flat out side to the doctor that the test results for the benefits of Tamoxifen are great, however, she was telling me that my 27% risk doesn't mean I will get cancer in my lifetime, so how do you know that the women who were in the Tamoxifen study would have developed cancer? Based on risk I could have been a part of the study so.... What do you do? You make the best decision for yourself and hope that you never get cancer. There is no guarantee that Tamoxifen will prevent me from getting cancer. There is no guarantee that if I don't take it, I will get cancer. I am thinking right now, I will take my chances and not add any extra drugs to my system. Sorry I am rambling, you are right there is no way to know if you will develop ADH again, but ADH isn't cancer. They aren't even sure (yes, I asked the oncologist this today) if develops into cancer, only that it is a warning sign your cells are doing something funky and to watch. They remove ADH to be sure there isn't DCIS around it or worse. But it isn't cancer. Yes, you may someday have to go through another biopsy, but honestly to me the ADH means they will watch me more closely and I don't think that is a bad thing. I am scheduled for a baseline MRI in August due to the ADH and \"extremely\" dense breasts. She told me I didn't need to do it right away, and wanted me to get over my other surgeries, I want it done and over with and then I am done with appointments til Novemeber!! YIPPEE ",
