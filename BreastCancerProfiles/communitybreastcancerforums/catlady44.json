I could cover that mirror with all the encouraging quotes I have! Some days, it's all I can cling to. For those of you who are religious - there are some days I wonder if God has forgotten me like everyone else. I know he hasn't ,but it sure feels like he has. You ladies are so comforting, just to know I'm not the only one struggling with this (although I wish none of you were struggling with this!) I think the hardest part is the disappearance of my support system. My hair came in looking like an afro. I actually googled \"short curly hair for ethnic women\" to find a hairstyle that will work! When I was a little girl, I used to pray that God would turn me into a black person. I've always joked that God must not like me because he made me Irish/Scandinavian, but at least I have the curls now! LOL Parts of my hair are flat, parts on just wavy and part are a tight curl. I spend so much time just trying to get it all looking the same way (have I said all this before??) This sounds crazy, but I miss the days of tying a scarf on my head and going. I loved those things and got really creative with it. I had a terrible body image before cancer so it's making this difficult. When I look at my chest, it doesn't even feel like those are my own body parts. Technically they really aren't. I read that going through this ages the body by 10 years. I truly feel that! I had a couple docs describe this whole thing as an assault. That is a great description. Everyone is so happy for me and I could just cry. When they ask how I'm doing, I'll tell them the complications and follow it up with \"at least the cancer is gone\". I figure no one wants to hear how rough a time I'm still having now that treatment is over. That's true, but I'm not feeling that joy. I'm grateful, but I feel shattered. People always told me that I was so strong and brave while I was going through treatment and I always thought, \"What's so brave about trying not to die?\" Cancer doesn't give a s&*% whether or not we were healthy before! It seems like an epidemic! Despite all this crap, I know this too shall pass. I just have to keep fighting like hell, just as much as I fought during cancer. Like Winston Churchill said, \"When you're going through hell, keep going.\" It's all we can really do. Much love to everybody!",

My hair had a weird wave before, but never this curly. I use lots of bobby pins to get it to lay flatter. I've always had short hair so I know how to manage that part. Your beauty WILL come back. It just takes a while unfortunately. We are SO wrecked by the treatment. Some of my nails are still a little discolored and have receded nail beds, but not near as bad as during treatment.

It's brand new hair, but the softness does eventually go away and you get normal texture back. Mine is still curly, but it's not as baby soft as it used to be. It's not messed up texture though. I use a cleansing conditioner to wash my hair because it doesn't dry it out as much as using shampoo. It's pretty gentle. I'm also coloring it, but I know a lot of women don't want to do that because of the chemicals. My stylist, who happens to be my cousin, uses a very nourishing color and it always looks a lot healthier afterwards. How are you ladies growing your hair longer? I was going to try to do that, but now the longer layers lay flat against my head with just a wave and the ends are shorter hair is a tight curl. I've also said I look like Kramer! I think I\"m going to give up on growing it out because it's such a pain in the butt, and I don't need anything else to struggle with. I understand people not wanting others to comment on looking like a cancer girl. Personally, I always liked the comments, because I felt like looking like I had cancer gave me permission to look like crap. I'm more self conscious now, probably because this body seems foreign to me. I do hate hearing how good I look, because I'm always thinking they are just being nice because they know I've had cancer. I also think, I may look nice, but I'm feeling like crap! I'm starting to avoid looking at my body in mirrors. When I look at my reconstructed breasts, I want to just cry. I have very fair, and therefore thin, skin so I may have had more scar tissue than other people. That's why my recon was so tricky. I have a fantastic plastic surgeon, but after surgery when he came out to talk to my family, he said that he did \"the best he could.\" Not something you want to hear after all this! He even spent extra time working on me. I don't want to scare any of you though. Some people look great after recon. I plan on getting some fancy tattoos to cover up the scars and make the asymmetry less noticeable. I'm not sure how to find a tattoo artist who works on breast cancer patients. I don't want any ink that prevents me from getting MRI's and it has to be a very sterile procedure. If I've repeated myself here, blame the chemo brain. It's made me dumb! I seem to have forgotten basic punctuation too!",

I wish I could be less self conscious about my hair! I want to wear a sign on my head that says, \"THE CHEMO DID THIS - NOT MY CHOICE\". Of course I don't have enough forehead for that! I had one lady ask me if I had a perm. I thought, Is that what people think?! I haven't had a perm since high school in the 1980's! I can't remember which lady was commenting about being too self conscious to go to the grocery store, but whoever it was, I am in a similar spot! I feel so dumb for letting this get to me - my husband's exwife has been horrible to me ever since we started dating 12 years ago. I rarely see the woman (thank God), but she lives nearby and I'm always afraid of running into her at the store. My daughter in law is having a baby shower next weekend and I'll have to be around her. I just know she's going to make some snide comment about my hair. Why do I let her get to me?! So stupid. My eyebrows came in annoying. One side is darker than the other and the hairs point in all different directions. I trim the ones sticking straight out (or up or wherever else they aren't supposed to be facing), but then I'm left with thin eyebrows. It's so frustrating! My fingernails have never fully recovered. They are still a little discolored, esp my thumb, but no where near being brown with deep ridges like during chemo. I also have a couple nail beds that are still receded and I guess they always will be. Why does this little change piss me off?! I know this is off the subject of this thread, but I just finished recon surgery and I think I'm having a body image crisis. I'm angry about all that cancer has stolen from me. I feel like a freak physically. We are all baddasses since we have been through hell, but our appearance always takes such a hit! If you saw my pic in earlier posts, you'll probably wonder why I'm complaining, but I am always my worst critic. I was having a \"good face day\" in that pic. It takes a lot of work to look as pretty as I used to. Of course getting older is no help! I always so jealous of you women who don't care what anyone thinks and proudly walk around in all your post chemo glory! I just can't figure out how to do that. Ugh, sorry - having a rough day. ",

Jennifer522 - I can't remember exactly how long it took for my eyebrows to grow back, but I don't think it was more than a few months. They never completely grew back though. They're patchy in spots, and some hairs now stick straight out or are growing in areas that eyebrows shouldn't be (like my forehead). I just draw them on. Clinique makes a really good eyebrow pencil.",

I don't want to spend the money and have it not work. I've been using Nioxin products. The shampoo and conditioner are nice, but they haven't really changed anything. I'm trying their 2% monoxidil (sp?) serum, so we'll see if that works. They also have a thickening hair gel that's awesome.",

When my hair was super curly, I used Loreal Cleansing Conditioner for curly hair. I'd then put Frizz Ease serum on it, then aragan oil and then Kevin Murphy's Killer Curls. His products are expensive, but I'm willing to shell out the money if it works. I'd then use Bed Head Manipulator to style and Bed Head After party on the ends, as well as Bed Head Hard Head hair spray. It probably sounds crazy to use that many different products, but whatever. They worked. My curl has fallen out, but my hair is still dry. I use Biolage Hydrosource Daily Leave in Cream and it really helps make my hair look less fried. I also use their ultra hydrosource shampoo, conditioning balm and hair masque. That stuff is AMAZING! I wish I'd known about it when my hair was curly! I know you're frustrated with your hair, but it looks really cute in your pic. I think we kind of have to let it do what it wants somewhat. When I tried straightening mine, it looked even worse. I have a ton of headbands and became very skilled at using bobby pins. It took some time before I could figure out how to deal with my hair. I hope my reply helps. You're definitely not alone with these struggles.",
