Has anyone refused to do surgury? They say it's benign. I dont want to go thru surgury when they say it's not even cancer yet. And I don't want to have to take tomoxi medications and be sick with all side effects. Is there a chance that it might not ever be cancer? And to go through all the surgeries and medication for nothing? Log in to post a reply",
