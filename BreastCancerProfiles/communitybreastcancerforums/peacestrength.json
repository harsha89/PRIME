I'm thankful to have three more years of living and experiencing my family. I've never gotten used to this diagnosis, I think about it every day, and all the suffering has forced me into acceptance. I'm vigilant everyday in self care and my post cancer lifestyle. I have crashed and burned so many times during the past three years and only by faith have I managed keep going. I have met beautiful people and been places that only a cancer diagnosis produces. If you are newly diagnosed with stage 3, my advice to you is: you are stronger than you can ever imagine and be your own medical advocate. Thank you, sisters, for you support...our sisterhood unites us in ways others can not fathom. 2013, IDC Stage 3a Log in to post a reply",
