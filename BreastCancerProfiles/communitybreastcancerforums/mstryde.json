Hoping the fact that I'm lactating doesn't affect the quality of images because I know there tends to be limitations regarding certain diagnostic tests such as mammograms with lactation. Fingers crossed.",

I have an appointment with my doctor on Friday to see if I can get in to see the dermatologist sooner, I agree that December is too long a wait. I do have severe eczema on my hands but it does not look like what is on my breast, it is dry and scaly rather than the red and raised skin on my breast, and I have never had any type of rash on my breast before I started breastfeeding. I have no raised lymph nodes, the dr did a breast exam the past week, and there is no thickened ridges either. This has been going on since before June on and off, I would really like some answers. Thanks for your replies.",

I still havent heard word back from her yet regarding an earlier appointment but I am going to call her tomorrow to see if she made progress. She took me seriously and knows I am concerned and agrees that we should not have to wait until December. I will keep you all updated. Thanks for your concerns.",

I had a ton of pictures though and we chatted for a while discussing possible causes. He assures me it is not IBC as that would not come and go. He still however is going to do a biopsy but he wants the rash to be active before he will do it. The rash comes every few weeks so whenever it returns I am to call and get in for a biopsy that same day. Will Keep everyone posted on that! Thanks again.",

My name is Megan, I'm 28, currently breastfeeding my 14 month old son. I have had a recurring itchy, blotchy, bumpy red rash since July. It only affects the left breast and is in one specific area and it does not affect the nipple or areola. I have been treated for fungal infection, mastitis and with a hydrocortisone cream and nothing works. The rash does not respond to any creams, it clears somewhat on its own and there always remains a pinkish hue to that same area. I get sharp shooting pains in my breast also. My doctor tells me not to worry and has referred me to a dermatologist however my appointment is not until December. I am terrified of IBC. Also, my mother is a breast cancer survivor, she was diagnosed with DCIS in 2011 at the age of 51, which makes me even more nervous. I have attached a photo, not quite sure of the quality.
