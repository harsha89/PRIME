I think some of this had to do with the cancer (it does take a toll on your body) and the double mastectomy but I also decided not to take it anymore. I want quality of life so if I have 5 or 10 years of being able to do the things I like and not an old grumpy b__ I will take that. I wish there were more posts from people who have chosen not to take the hormones because ,even though you have made a decision, it is still scary and to get some encouragement from others who have made the same choice would be comforting.

Have been diagnosed with arthritis in my neck which they say is causing the shoulder pain on my left side. My breast cancer was on the right side only. Recently have had soreness in my tail bone and in my mid back and some in my left hip. I had a bone scan about 2 months ago and nothing was found. Now I read that bone scan may not be able to pick up certain mets. I was wondering about your experiences with bones mets? Is it really painful right away or does it start as soreness and get worse? I have arthritis and bone one bone knee problems. I am kind of a mess. Don't want to jump to conclusions but also don't want to overlook something that I shouldn't. Thank you for allowing us early stagers to ask you guys questions. I am in awe of your strength.",
