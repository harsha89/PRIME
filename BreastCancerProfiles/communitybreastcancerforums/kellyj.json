I had radiation on it when it reappeared.  Then the darndest  thing happened.  My low stage, not aggressive, breast cancer recurred.  The chemo was very hard for me, but I kept plugging along and didn't complain.  I haven't complained about having two separate issues.  I won't let myself.   I feel if we take away the stage from the cancer, the treatment still sucks and is scary regardless.   Bless you all, Kelly",

I go next week to check on it again.  My onc said that it could be due to several things other than parathyroid.  It could be the arimidex I am on, cancer that is now in the bones (usually this is late stage) , or dehydration at time of test.  I am anxious also to get to the bottom of it.  She was not worried yet.  Let me know if you get answers before I do!! praying for you, Kelly ",

I knew I wanted bilateral mastectomies and went ahead with them.  The surgery to put in the expanders was tough for me, lots of pain.  I had an excellent result, with my breasts looking better than before.  I was 37 at the time of my surgery.  The only downside? My cancer came back locally regardless... I am now finishing up my last week of radiation.  I still do not regret my decision, so far the implants still look good. I know I run the risk of a contracture down the road, but I will take one day at a time.  Good luck to you!",

Two against it, and one for it.  The two against chemo were from research hospitals and were well informed on the oncotype , while the doc for chemo was not.  Good luck and keep us posted on your decision.

Low chance of recurrence.  Two of my three onc opinions said that chemo would add only a 3 to 4% benefit. The third onc said do the chemo, you are only 37, and if it comes back its fatal.  Well, I did not do the chemo and two years later it recurred as a lump in the same breast. This was AFTER a double mastectomy! They say there is only a 2 percent chance of that happening.  Luckily, it has not spread and I am redoing my tx.  Eight rounds of chemo, 6 weeks of rads, ovaries out, and a new antiestrogen drug. I was on tamoxifen when it returned. Best of luck with your decision. It is a hard one.",

I just know I was having many hot flashes per day and a lack of a period. My onc listened to my concerns, but said they hope that the side effects do decrease with drugs without affecting the effectiveness.  Who knows, I have no proof tamoxifen wasn't working.",

My SEs from the drug went away all of a sudden. Oh well, it will a remain a mystery to me. Must go forward from here! Good luck to you! Kelly ",
