So we should care about metastasis before recurrence, the onco dx test not accurate 100% ( like Ca 15.3 and CEA mark tumour ) if the doctors not make sure you are free-cancer disease and metastases not present in your ct/bone scan .that's what I know and no idea how much accurate is that.",

I mean tumor marker, I think most of you know about CA 15.3, CA 125 and CEA blood test, they can follow up the cancer mets/rec. well. its not 100% perfect but it gives indecations about your status, I think its not costly. some time the result become high for other reasons, however, if its more than 30, its better to visit the doctor. these 3 tests can help who treat their cancer and also the new diagnoses to know if the metastasis spread in your body with other test like ct and bone scan. hope its help, 2017 is better than before",

I do not have any idea about oncology score. only I have Ki-67= 70%. I think chemo working well in triple negative but do you know how the doctor check its performance in your body? ( ignor the size of tumor in your answer please because its common answer). How old R U ?\\ frozentoes I am sorry about your case, as you said we almost the same. Did you make Bone scan, CT scan and biopsy for auxiliary node and tumor BEFORE THE DOCTOR TOLD you you are in Stage 2A and 2.5 cm? or you did the previous tests after Clinical examination ( physical test ) ? most of the doctor identify the stages after many tests, conversely the others identify it from the beginning without make any test and this is not accurate. because CT scan can catch the nodes in breast node with assistance of biopsy to diagnose the situation . I hope FEC working well as well as AC in your protocol treatment :) shaneswife828 I am sorry, why the SE appear like that with you? I think it should not be! DO NOT TRY to think about stopping the chemo, its working well with triple negative and no more options in your case. ask your doctor to reduce the dose or find some solution to this issues. Also I read someone here, I do not remember who wrote that, face a lot of problem in her neuron system on feet. and she stooped chemo due to this problem . I do not know if this problem is a common or rare SEs. so sorry and I am sad to hear that. my chemo on MONDAY :( how many cycles you will finish ?",

Blair - you are right! Someone wrote here, I do not remember who, its better to be in stage 2 better than 1 due to aggressive treatment. the recurrence in stage 1 more than 2 with lymph nodes based on that replayed. Chemo, Surgery, radiation are important to kill escaped cells that not shows on the test. A lot of people diagnosed with stage 0, DCIS and 1 ( they not took chemo) and faced recurrence within 4-8 years! I hope we will take a full benefits of 2018 and avoid the recurrences + complete treatment . Did you hear someone faced cancer spread during chemo ? this story make me fear if its true :( Ekra .",

I read about Oncotype Dx score, I think I can not do this test and I am sad . because you are in stage 1 (No node involvement), you can do this test and see the chances of return the cancer back. for my side, I have two positive node, I am Stage 2A according to my doctor, so I can not do this test due to node. I am afraid about node involvement too much because I do not know how much worst is that to my body and treatment plan . I cry too much when I remember these two positive nodes. Can chemo reduce the number of nodes involved ? what the chemo do to lymph nodes?  ",

I did exercises to keep my hand better with no swelling and lymphedema. - they told me you will start radiotherapy after 8-10 weeks from surgery. all this time pass and I will start on Monday. 25 cycles then doctors will decide to increase or stop. no idea about hormone therapy yet. when I finished the surgery I asked the doctor: am I cancer-free now?! he said it's not like that and keep silent. when I research on internet I found \"remission\" word, not cured, is that true? will I be as cancer patient (incurable disease) for all my life? ❤❤",

The doctor told me, according to your status, you will take 5 years tamoxifen pills + Lupron Depot 3.75 mg vial. one injection / month for 5 years also. the reason is because I was pre menopause. but actually it's already gone after second cycles of chemo (around 5 months from now). he told me that I will provide your treatment as a premenopause! also he told me that I'm in high risk of recurrence because I had high ki-67 ( 70%) and grade 3 . I told him I had also high ER% and PR% with no Her2 . he replayed the same: still high risk! he shocked me. when I read yours replay and articles on internet they told the positive receptors patients have good outlook and prognosis. why he told me your recurrence rate is between 20-30%? I did chemo, radial mastectomy and radiation and today is my fisrt day on tamoxifen and Lupron (LHRH). why the recurrence rate is high? he told me the ki-67 is subjective but we take it in our account, if it's high we will ask chemo, if it's low may not ! what is the specific factors to decide if my cancer is aggressive or not? he told me I'm stage 2a, even if the chemo did better, he will act me as stage 2, no down-stage . I had only one lymph node after chemo in my pathology report out of 25 out! please share your experience. I really shocked and cry.",

I understand that we will kill the cancer cells by chemo, surgery and radiotherapy then you will take hormone as preventive therapy. if you pass the first 5 years mostly the cancer will not back, if it's back it means this is new cancer. that what I understand from him. that's why we took all available treatment to reduce the chance of any risk + regular follow-up to catch any new things immediately. I had lymph node positive so I can not do oncotype to test 21 genes. how can I know the percentage of recurrence? I'm like you, er/pr+ and her2 negative, grade 3. I think my er/pr percentage is high, more than 70%, actually I don't remember. is that good or bad sign? It's bad to know that you have incurabe disease, no chance to be clean forever. I hope someone will motivate me and say you are wrong. cancer can cure and the statistics support this vision but ...... good news about your back pain. keep going 👍 do you know your ki67 and tumor size? grade?",

Finally, sometimes the childbirth make our body more weak, specially if you do that continuously without break at least 2 years. Hope you will be fine",

I have no idea about that, still I don't get the result. according to the doctor, no evidance about metasise that break the lymph nodes, two positives node don't mean the cancer spread, is that true? did you mean if I have two nodes involve, maybe after chemo will become one nodes?

I had a bad day after Taxotere infusion in previous Monday. now I'm in 5th day and still feel not ok. just I want to ask you if you faced or you know someone faced like this issue: Today I check my right nipple (which tumour is their) and I found a yellow spots on the surface! I'm not sure if there is a little discharge or not. but the yellow spots looks like there is some liquid become dry! it's removable spots. did anyone face something like that during Taxotere or any type of chemo? remembering that, I did ultrasound before 5 weeks or less to check the respond of my tumour with neoadjance chemo. the report not show something strange. yesterday I feel breast pain all night, specially in the tumour location. .no ideas if there is relation between pain and yellow spots.",

I read if it's high, the chance of recurrence will be high. I'm er,pr+ and her2 negative.before I take chemo I think the ki-67 and grade will reduced after treatment, but actually it's almost same. I'm afraid when I know there is correlation between ki67 and recurrence 💔. moreover, if I need to stage my cancer right now, should I stage it before or after chemo? because I did chemo to down-stage my cancer. what do you think? someone told me it's great if your PR hormones are high in your cancer, is that true and why? thanks for help.

I asked him this percentage before or after treatment and he said it's after because the cancer is present before! when I used calculator it showed the mortality rate is 9% after 15 years. this percentage not care even you are free-cancer or locally/metastasized cancer back. the sentence that written by calculator said you may be dead after 15 years with no details if you are healthy or sick. cancer or non-cancer and that's not encourage which is bad for me.",
