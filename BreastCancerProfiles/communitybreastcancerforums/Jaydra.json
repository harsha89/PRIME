(like a rope-like feeling) I would suggest what imadaughter had suggested and see if you can get seen for free somewhere or even assistance of some kind. What's going on with you could be something benign and simple, it could be an infection or a papilloma (which although usually benign should be removed) or it could be something serious. It's hard to say. I certainly hope it's benign and that all will be well. But, fact is you can't ever be really sure without the diagnostic tests and even more so... a biopsy.",

The area of hardness was fairly big back in August/September but now it's maybe the size of a golf ball maybe even smaller than that. The last couple days it has been very painful..

I have done a lot of reading on this and have even found some older posts on the boards.. seems this is more common then I realized and I wonder why surgeons don't tell patients what to expect in regards to scar tissue etc so that we're not freaking out later. My surgery was in August (fibrocystic and duct ectasia).. it was hard and painful for awhile.. some of the hardness went away and the pain shrunk to a mild discomfort especially during my period... so it shocked me to have pain again.. pain that was bringing me to tears! According to the ultrasound it is scar tissue and there is a small build up of fluid around it which may be the beginning of an infection.. so I'm on some antibiotics now and guess we'll go from there.. a day and a half into the antibiotics, the pain is subsiding.  I'm wondering if because it was duct ectasia (which is just another form of periductal mastitis apparently) if I will have these issues forever. I did quit smoking 17 days ago.. so hopefully that helps! ",
