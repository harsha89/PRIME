I've had muscle pain from the expanders, and then saline implants, since March 2005.  I don't regret this experience, because I think I needed to go through this in order to be content with a completely flat chest. I'm curious to know how implants are \"installed\", because the dr told me that he will not be able to take parts of the reconstruction out.  It sounds like they glue a platform, or capsule, to the ribs that can't be taken off. I told him I wanted to be as neatly flat and symmetrical as possible, and that it seemed to me that it would be best if he took out the implants, and then gave me a couple months to tighten my muscles back up before he excised the loose skin.  He said that sounded right, but would have to check on whether insurance would pay for two operations. I'm so looking forward to losing \"weight\" in the New Year! sally  Log in to post a reply",

It's good to find out the facts before jumping in.  Doctors sometimes sell the lumpectomy as a less invasive procedure than a mastectomy.  But the accompanying rads often cause complications that are not expected.  If the cancer comes back in the breast and you need to have a mastectomy, then rads often make reconstruction difficult or impossible. They can also cause lymphedema. With a mastecomy they might also recommend rads depending on the location of the cancerous cells, but often not. There are a lot of women on this site who have debated the decisions that you are struggling with. You're not alone. sally Do a search on inshock.  She also has DCIS stage 0.",

She has been taking chemo off and on since then.  She doesn't have a curable cancer, but she hasn't done badly with chemo treatments.  And she has had six years with her youngest grandson, who was only 3 months old when she had her surgery.

In my case, my mom has ovarian, and my sister has bc, so I have even more chance. Also, I was premenstrual so I couldn't go on an AI. I would have had to take tamoxifen, which has a much higher chance of blood clots. I have a common genetic increased risk anyway (called Factor 5 Leiden), so my chance of getting clots was high. I haven't had problems in the 2 years I've been on Arimidex. sally ",

If you go through the surgery this week you probably will feel very sore for the wedding, lumpectomy or mastectomy.  Unfortunately, there is always the chance of complications.  But even if it is problem-free, I don't think many of us would have been able to hug hundreds of people, dance all night, and do the multi-tasking that is required of a bride's mom after our surgeries. Also, there are women here who have had complications from trying to do too much too soon.  With a mast. you will have a tube draining the fluid out for at least a week, but even if it is a lumpectomy with sentinal node removal only, the tissues are cut, so you really can't lift anything or do any vigorous movement with your arm for awhile.  Many of us have had hematomas because we did. I  think you will be happier waiting until after the wedding for your surgery.  We all want to forge ahead and rid our bodies of cancer and our minds of the worry, but first be happy at your daughter's wedding. sally ",

Last week when I found the lump on my neck, he did seem concerned.  He said that bc would normally go to the supraclavicular lymph node, not the jugular lymph node.  Mine is on the side of my neck, under my ear.

There is a direct association between breast and ovarian cancer, but they are still researching a link between thyroid and breast. \"A review of the literature on the relationship between thyroid disorders and breast cancer does not provide conclusive evidence for the establishment of a causal relationship as breast cancer has been associated with hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism and nontoxic goiter. Most reports on the association of thyroid enlargement and breast cancer have emanated from areas of endemic iodine deficiency and these reports have relied on neck palpation. The contribution of the present study is in the application of the highly sensitive technique of diagnostic ultrasound to the investigation of subtle changes in thyroid volume and anatomy in patients with breast cancer. The mean thyroid volume of 20.4 +/- 1.0 ml in 184 breast cancer patients was significantly greater than that of 12.9 +/- 1.2 ml in age-matched controls (p < 0.01). Also the number of individual patients with breast cancer having enlarged thyroid glands (73/184; 39.7%) was significantly greater than the corresponding number (13/150; 8.6%) in the control group (p < 0.001). There was a direct correlation between thyroid enlargement and breast tumour staging. Both mean thyroid volume and % of enlarged thyroids were identical in groups of patients scanned after (Retrospective Group) and before (Prospective Group) various therapies for breast cancer, thus excluding therapeutic intervention as a cause for thyroid enlargement. The results indicate a direct relationship between the two disorders perhaps involving a common growth stimulus and emphasise the importance of raising the consciousness of the coincidence of both disorders.\" It sounds like the connection might be the genetic factors that cause breast cancer might also cause thyroid enlargement and cancer, such as low antibodies for cancers and accelerated cell growth.  And treatments for one cancer might start the other, such as the iodine therapy for thyroid c triggers breast c, and the radiation for breast c causes thyroid c. The bottom line is that all women who have one should be vigilant for the other.  And the \"good\" thing about thyroid cancer is that it is one of the easiest cancers to detect and cure.  My dad ignored symptoms and was misdiagnosed for years, whereas my sister found hers early on and is cancer-free. sally ",

If I were you, I would first tell them that you are sensitive to needles and pain (everyone has varying pain tolerance). State it clearly, without whining or tears.  Ask for a topical numbing solution (they rub it on).  Then request an injection of lidocaine before the IV is put in.  The nurses will say that it makes it harder, because it restricts the blood vessels, but they can do it.  If you are at the hospital, you can also request the IV specialist. The nurses also might balk at this, because it slows the schedule down. If you feel very fearful, ask your dr if you can take a sedative orally, and have someone drive you to and from the tests. Especially request a topical anesthesia before the sentinel node biopsy injections the day before your surgery. You will find that you're tougher than you think. sally ",

My list: 1. Lobular more often jumps to the other side 2. My \"good\" breast was very lumpy and would have meant unending biopsies 3. With one clear side I have an uncompromised arm for blood pressure and IVs 4. I didn't want radiation that is required with lumpectomies 5. I felt that I was lucky the first time to have found it so early, and might not be so lucky again 6. Family: my mom has ovarian c, my sister has IDC 7.

So that is good news for you if it only involves your nipple.  I guess I would push for an MRI, and tests to be sure there is no DCIS, for your peace of mind. Take care, sally ",

Small hospitals are fine for getting your chemo treatments and radiation, but they may not have the best and most current diagnostic tools. The tests they use now are very sophisticated. They can tell by testing the tumor whether the cancer will respond to hormone drugs alone, or whether you require chemo.  That is a HUGE deal.  Chemo is a very harsh treatment, and if there is a chance you don't need it, then you don't want it! Your family needs you.  One hard thing about cancer is that you feel better before treatment begins.  It's deceptive, but you can't ignore it.

Although I still have pain in my neck that probably is permanent, I don't have that horrible tight feeling down the sides of my neck, and the feeling like my foobs are squishing under my arms when I lift anything heavy. I was also having problems with muscle contractions (esp when I was trying to get to sleep) around the implants, which might have been the start of capsular contracture. My foobs looked fine, but a large part of sexiness is feeling good.  For me, being in pain wasn't sexy. sally ",

      "Content": "Apr 1, 2008 04:34PM - edited Apr 1, 2008 04:35PM by SLH Hi Dawn, There are no set-in-stone reasons for getting lymphedema, although we all need to take precautions. Sometimes the \"least invasive\" surgery of lumpectomy + radiation will cause it. I had a bilateral w/expanders, plus 4 nodes taken out of my left side.  Six months later I had my exchange surgery, a month after that a hysterectomy.  Then six months later I had scar tissue from my hysterectomy wrap around my intestines and had emergency abdominal surgery.  I came out of anesthesia with an auto BP compressor on my \"bad\" left arm.  It was on all night. Two months later, I gently picked up what I thought was a nice cat, and it buried its teeth into my \"bad\" arm for a minute.  I ended up with a GIGANTIC infection and two days in the hospital with IV antibiotics.  My arm was swollen from my fingertips to my elbow with red lines going up to my shoulder. But I didn't get lymphedema.  With my luck, I'm keeping my fingers crossed for the rest of my life! sally ",

My mom has had ovarian cancer for 6 years, dx when she was 80.  She had the physical stamina of a 60-yr-old when she started, and she did really well through the surgery, but the continuing chemo treatments have been rough on her. Also, my mom had scar tissue from the original surgery that blocked her intestines, so she had emergency abdominal surgery 2 years ago. For those 8 days in the hospital, my mom went completely \"crazy\"--hallucinating, trying to jump out of bed, didn't know where she was or why her stomach hurt. Maybe the chemo influenced this, but the drs said it happens sometimes when elderly people have surgery.  We had to watch her 24/7 in the hospital.  The day the drs signed the release form to let her go home, she snapped out of it.  She suddenly was mentally back, but didn't remember any of the past 8 days. If your mom could do surgery only, and avoid chemo, it would help her mentally. Breast surgery isn't quite as harsh as abdominal surgery, so the anesthesia won't be as bad. Take care,  sally ",
