I have had several issues/biopsies/surgeries and now have LCIS - Lobular Carcinoma In Situ, Atypical Ductal Hyperplasia and Atypical Lobular Hyperplasia.  All three are considered pre-cancerous or pre-cursors to breast cancer.  So, because of my family history and my issues I am scheduled for a propholactic double mastectomy on December 7th.  I am 49. Hopefully, at the breast care clinic they will advise you to get genetic testing.  I am assuming you are much younger than me :)  If so, ask about getting annual MRI's and of course, mammograms. I am so sorry for the loss of your mother! Take care, Valarie",

My last MRI picked up lots of things that they labeled as \"probably\" benign.  I have dense breasts and have been told I have several cysts in both breasts. I don't want the stress anymore, or the chance that there is something in there they haven't detected, like you.  So, December 7th I am having BMX with imediate DIEP reconstruction.

I have VERY cystic and dense breasts, so I feel a lot more comfortable doing this surgery Take care, Valarie",

My mother passed when she was 38 from breast cancer, my grandmother in her late 40's and my moms sister at 41. I tested negative(undetermined) for BRCA 1 & 2. I have had several biopsies and 3 lumpectomies. In the last couple of years, pathology has come back with LCIS, ADH and ALH... all in the left breast. So, I opted for a PBMX with reconstruction (DIEP) on December 7th. I can't tell you the relief I feel, especially since I got the pathology report back. LCIS, ADH & ALH in left breast (according to my latest MRI it had all been removed when I had my lumpectomy. But, it also showed extensive ADH and ALH in the right breast. In all my screenings I have always been told the right breast was clear. SO, be vigilent and go with what you feel is right for you! Good luck, ladies....and let me know if you have any questions. I would be happy to give my email address, or cell number if you private message me. Take Care, Valarie",

Like you, I'm a pretty positive person and tend not to worry about things unless I have to....but, this time, I've been flip flopping.  So, I really understand what you mean.  You want to be positive because the Dr. says its \"probably\" nothing, but you can't help thinking, \"what if\".

I've lost 52lbs and I'm no longer diebetic :)   So, I'm in better shape than I've ever been, so I don't think it was that.  But, I was in the MRI machine for an hour and 15 minutes...and I didn't move a muscle.  My ribs were laying on a hard plastic thing, so maybe thats why.  My right side ribs are very sore and tender even today. But yes, I'm glad its behind me, too :) How are you doing?  Are you ready for the holidays? Valarie",

I hope you are having a blessed Christmas!  Ladies, no matter what.... we can face it!  I just went for a long walk and for some reason I now feel very positive about everything.  No matter what it is... good or bad, I know I can face it head on. Thank you all for being on these boards... I prayed for all of you on my long walk! Valarie",

I know its so easy to freak out about it, its a natural reaction to the unknown.  I am just glad they are taking the steps to ensure me that everything is ok. So, I hope there's room in that boat for me :) Valarie",
