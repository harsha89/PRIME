With everything digital now, I have access to my records and have seen how they are going up and down and now up again.  Bilirubin is the same at .5 ALT is now 32 whereas before it was at 19 .. but in 2007, it was the same as now  ..32.... so why did it go  down, how did I manage to get such average numbers but now on the high side? ALP (alkaline phosphate)  is now 99, it was 95 before. They seem to be fluctuating a great deal.  But in January of 09, it was 111. In August of 2008, it was at 88. What could be going on with this?  I am not a heavy drinker and I don't seem to have any pain in bones so it shouldn't be calcium getting into my blood stream. Does exercise have anything to do with this???  Peace out Log in to post a reply",
