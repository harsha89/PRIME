Right post surgical scar appears more contracted. There is a calcification on a post surgical scar. No significant masses or calcifications are seen in either breast. Clinical correlation and if warrented breast MRI may be of help to rule out recurrent cancer. Log in to post a reply",

She has on the side of her breasts; something that looks like spider bites. She has around 5. She also said the other day she had some pain on her breast but it now it is gone. She has had those spider bites pimples for months. Does anyone know what this could be? Log in to post a reply",
