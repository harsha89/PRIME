I was diagnosed with stage 1 colon cancer and stage 0 Melanoma the same year at age 40. I started reading here because not so many young women have colon cancer. And because I am high risk for breast cancer due to family history. My kids are 16 and 14. I am on mission to raise them because they don\u2019t really have anybody else. And I WILL raise them",

I am also high risk for breast cancer so I go to Dr. Marilyn Leitch, Director of UT Southwestern's Center for Breast Care in Dallas. She is an amazing doc and very caring. She noticed a bad looking mole during my visit. And it ended up being stage 0 Melanoma. When I was diagnosed with colon cancer I had 2nd opinion at UT Southwestern Dallas. I have been very happy with their care. The next place I would go is MD. Anderson in Houston. Good luck",

But for us with kids coming home from school at 4:00 pm - it's easy to keep life the same as much as possible. I honestly can't imagine how you should do it with 3 kids at home. Please reach out for help. Talk to your family and close friends for help",

You have to wait for the pathology. You will have to have colonoscopy more often now. If you had malignant cells - it would most likely be stage 0 or 1 colon cancer. But your chances are very low. I didn\u2019t have breast cancer. But have strong family history. But had malignant colon polyp overs 3 years ago. Stage 1 colon cancer. I only had polyp removed and so far good",
