I kinda bit his head off since I was trying to stay on top of the information I needed, and his moaning and trying to rub my shoulder were NOT helpful. And early in my cancer diagnoses, he started asking the doctor questions that were on my list, like I wasn't even there. I wanted him to remind me, not ignore me.

I did that, but insisted on waiting until October 29th to start treatments. That was the last date agreeable to everyone, so it seems like 12 weeks to start is the limit on the window of optimal treatment time. Ick, I was still hurting and cranky as hell the first few weeks because of the position I had to be in. But I'm glad I got it over with.",

Since breasts are soft tissue, unless it's a very hard tumor, it's more difficult to tell if the entire tumor has been excised in a lumpectomy, or if there are small scattered ones - and some types of cancers make it extremely difficult to physically find them. Node involvement is also an issue. So radiation is used to clean up strays and leftovers, not as a preventive of recurrence; that's the job of anti-hormonals. We are lucky to have the Oncotype test for certain early-stage cancers so chemo (used as a system-wide clean up for those with a higher chance of stray cells throughout their bodies) isn't thrown at people who don't need it.",

He also stated that it's why there's about a week between the set-up and treatments, because the whole angle-trajectory thingie has to be calculated to get the beam to go around very precisely. It's very similar to string or wire art, creating curves from angles. Luckily I loved string art years ago, and geometry was the only branch of mathematics that ever made sense to me, so I could visualize exactly what he was explaining.",

So far the only problems are how tedious it is to go every weekday (I'm retired and thought I was past that!), and one tiny rash spot that seems to have been a reaction to the tape marker. Odd because I didn't react in the other spots, but they stopped using tape and it's all cleared up. Oh, and I had a re-excision; no big deal and didn't even need a pain pill afterward. JoE777, a lumpectomy IS a partial mastectomy.",

My BS originally planned to do that, but she wanted to keep the breast incision smaller, so she did two. The node one isn't really in the armpit, more on the edge of the breast, so it's easy to include node removal for an outer edge lump.",

Seriously, it's a fine line -- I was so upbeat and humorous in my approach on FB that I erased any potential sympathy. It would have been nice to have just one long-time friend or family member ask how I'm doing, but that hasn't happened since my initial silly announcement. The only exceptions are an ex-coworker I didn't know very well, who has stage 4 ovarian cancer, and has been cheering me on in private messages (she's a new old friend now), and a new niece-in-law who made offers of assistance. But I just can't ask for sympathy, ick. If I have a pity party, I want booze and male strippers!",
