They see cancer everyday. think its a great sign that your radiologist thinks its a fibroadenoma. My biopsy was more painful than I expected, but my lump was not in the same position as yours. My advice is to be easy on yourself, stay off the internet, and try and focus on other stuff until your results. HUGS!!!",
