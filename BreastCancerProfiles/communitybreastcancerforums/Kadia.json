I am hoping the answer is that the medicine is less effective...not that it becomes some contaminated soup. For the record, I am not experiencing side effects any different than my previous round of chemo (T/C), when I did not have Neupogen at all. Right now, I am feeling too embarassed to call and ask my MO about this.

Haven't seen my MO yet, but my BS said that chemo is likely to be recommended to me due to my tumors being multifocal and multicentric and also my (relatively) young age. No oncotype score yet. I am ER/PR+, HER2 -, with a very low (5%) Ki-67 score. My issue is that I have a very big trip--my 20th college reunion--coming up in early June, and have been planning to attend with friends since before my dx. The reunion is across the country from where I live and is in a big, busy city.  If I can do so safely, I really want to put off chemo until early June, which would be about 19 weeks post-surgery. From reading here, it seems that the standard of care is to begin chemo no later than 12 weeks post-surgery.  I am wondering: 1) how long most people go between surgery and chemo   2) where that 12 week standard comes from  3) If I do begin chemo before June, should I assume a cross-country trip to a big city is a no-go if it falls mid-treatment?
