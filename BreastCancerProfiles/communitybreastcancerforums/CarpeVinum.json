I also have a very high tolerance for pain but this recent bout in my spine is really kicking my ass! So I would ask your Dr if a high dose of steroids for a couple of days would be OK. It might help you through the week, help you get some good sleep. You don't want to take it for too long though, side effects can include eating nonstop lol.",

The only thing that has helped is Prednisone. 12.5 mg with breakfast, 12.5 mg with lunch. Sometimes an Ambien at night. I hate to take steroids at all, but this is a low dose and hopefully the rads will help with the pain soon. My rad onc prescribed 10mg Oxycodone ER to take at bedtime (or every 12 hours), AND 5mg (not the extended release) to take every 6 hours as needed. I haven't tried the double dosing yet as I have young kids who need me up and awake in the mornings! Hope you can find something that works. I've found sleeping in an almost upright position on the couch helps.",

I'm going to a friend's Pampered Chef party today with dark brown shaved sides and a dark blond 2\" long spikey center. I better not hover over the food though (like I usually do!) just in case it does start falling out! ewww My scalp is SO SORE though, deep bruised feeling, that I may shave it all off tomorrow. I'll have some fun with it today though... I have my next chemo on Monday. I hope everyone is having a relaxing weekend and feeling well, or at least recovering and feeling better. Hugs and drink that water!! I buy a couple of 1 gal bottles of purified water to drink the day before, of, and 2 days after my infusion. Wendy ",

You'll know it will be soon when you start to feel a strange tingling or tenderness in your scalp. That's the day I had my kids chop of my long hair, style it into a sort of Mohawk and we all had a good laugh. The next night I couldn't stand it any more and had my hubby shave it down to 1/4\". I would shampoo and rinse and rinse and rinse in the shower and the hairs just kept sticking to my hands, kind of like when you bathe a long-haired shedding dog. I was relieved when it was all out because that tender-scalp feeling makes it kind of hard to sleep. Oh I lost most of my eyebrows and all of my body hair too! Having no body hair was FANTASTIC and wow were my showers short ~ no shampoo/conditioning and no shaving. Anywhere. The last period I had was 21 days after my first infusion. Hasn't been back since. I can't say that I miss it AT ALL. I'll be thinking of all of you ladies who are doing your first chemo this week. Drink drink drink water, green tea, juice, Gatorade, whatever you can, even if you can't stand the thought of it. With my last chemo I had terrible constipation. That was hands down the very worst side effect. It's bad enough being bunged up, but you don't want that toxic $#itstorm  in you any longer than necessary. On infusion #2 I drank one cup of Smooth Move Tea (on day 1 before bed) and that solved that problem. I did get some wicked cramps but it was better than the alternative. Some wonderful friends gave me a care package and in it I found some Sea Bands. They really worked for nausea. REALLY. If you haven't got them I would strongly recommend them. Also Chimes Ginger Chews worked well. Here's hoping for lots of restful, healing days ahead ♥",

For those with furry tongues ~ I did the same as tekwriter, used a very soft child size toothbrush and brushed a few times a day during my last chemo reg. I found that tastebud death came soon after the furry tongue but am happy to report I did get my taste back after chemo ended, probably 2 weeks later. I would strongly suggest that if you get changes in taste, try to stay away from your favorite foods and drinks or you may have a strong aversion to them when your buds get back to normal. Also I had to use plastic cutlery now and then because metal was AWFUL.  sunshower  wow! ~ good going on the water! I barely got down 2 cups today. I better step it up right now... ",

I am now exactly 4 months out from my last chemo. My eyelashes are coming back. My eyebrows not so much but I'm getting good at drawing them on.  ;)  Also, I have got hair! It's short but it's full and soft and omg so curly. I went out today without a hat. That's a first. I am starting to get those pesky delayed chemo side effects that I got last time. Numb alternating with burning feet. Numb fingers. Extreme joint pain. But I am able to get out of bed every single day and enjoy my friends and family. When my kids start back to school in less than 2 weeks I will attempt a very modified workout at my neighborhood gym. I need to get back in shape for a couple of upcoming trips! My family just got accepted for a retreat to Lake Tahoe through Little Pink Houses of Hope. They are a non profit who provide FREE week long vacations for breast cancer patients and their families. We are going the last week of September. They \"believe a cancer diagnosis does not just affect the patient, but the entire family.  Every beach retreat is designed to help families relax, reconnect and rejuvenate during the cancer journey.\" I read about them here on BCO, and submitted an application a couple of months ago. I urge you all to apply. They have many dates and locations to choose from. It's amazing. I am also flying up to my hometown, Vancouver BC, to visit family and friends and have a girls' weekend up Whistler/Blackcomb with some ladies I went to school with. Some of them I've known since elementary school. I am so looking forward to that. My best friend who just bought a duplex up at Whistler has booked ziplining for us. Now that is something that before my cancer dx I would have said NOPE to, but now it's something I really feel like I want to do lol. Just skimming through the recent posts it seems a lot of us are done with chemo or close to finishing up, getting surgery and recovering from bmxs. Even though I've been away from the board for a bit I have been thinking about all of you and hope you are all enjoying the summer. Here's a link to the Little Pink Houses website ~ XO Wendy http://www.littlepink.org/",

(shaved pixie) and I love it. I colored it myself using L'Oreal Mousse Absolue in a dark brown for the undercut (it's a reusable mousse that is FANTASTIC and so quick and easy) and Shea Moisture Hair Color System in a light brown for the top.  Didn't damage my hair at all. My top layer and bangs (if you can call them that lol) are still the very fine first new growth that is like baby hair and it didn't harm it at all. I'm ready for a trim of the undercut already, it's still very curly and I like it clipped right down. I bought myself a mini flat iron that also hasn't harmed my hair (I straighten the top a bit.)  So, rest assured, your hair will eventually grow :)   My eyebrows still haven't made much of an appearance though. I'm thinking they've flown the coop for good. I can live with that. I finished my 10X external beam rads on my soft tissue lesion near T4 spine and also finished my 5 CyberKnife treatments on my T4 pedicle. I am almost pain free at the moment, just a nagging ache still, but I have my next Petscan scheduled for the first week of Oct. I just returned from a trip home to Vancouver by myself (no hubby or punks!) and had the most relaxing yet invigorating time. My best friend since high school treated me to a weekend at her place in Whistler/Blackcomb and we went ziplining at Cougar Mtn. SuperFly was the name of the company if any locals are interested. I still can't believe I did it. 640 feet above the ground (through the alpine trees) and reached speeds of 50 mph. It was amazing. I think I mentioned that my family has been chosen to spend a week at a beachhouse at Lake Tahoe and we leave on Sept 24th. I can't wait to meet other families who are going through the same thing we are, and to just relax and enjoy ourselves. I'm getting in all the traveling that I can, while I still can. I haven't had time to read through everyone's posts. I've found coming here to be a bit depressing sometimes but am keeping you all in my thoughts and hope you are all feeling well and having an easy time with your treatments and recovery. XOX Wendy oh ~ I've linked the haircolors below for anyone that is interested. I think I bought them both at Target. The Shea is in the ethnic section. I'm also adding a link for TAG Superfly at Whistler. Click on the video and watch the ziplining. Words can't describe how scary yet exhilarating it is but this video gives you an idea. http://tagwhistler.com/activity/superfly/  http://www.lorealparisusa.com/en/brands/hair-color/mousse-absolue.aspx http://www.sheamoisture.com/Hair-Color_c_138.html",

I will try the bicarb/salt rinse you ladies mentioned. Last year before my chemo I got 3 gorgeous wigs ~ one brunette super long and straight real human hair (that my insurance covered for $1,700!), one synthetic below the shoulder layered and highlighted brunette/caramel that was given to me free from a local cancer center where I attended the Look Good Feel Better session, and one sassy, almost to the shoulder blond layered synthetic that I went out and bought myself. I have had such brutal, constant hot flashes that I've been way too hot to wear any of them! lol. I spent almost everyday of my baldness wearing either a ball cap or a bandana tied biker style on my head. I was often too shy or insecure to go fully bald, and I got tired of the looks of pity that I got when I did. I know people meant well, and were trying to be compassionate I suppose. I felt strong and competent and didn't want their pity. I did wear the long real hair one on Halloween though! I made an awesome witch ;) I really enjoyed the LGFB session. I went a week before my chemo started because it was the only date that worked for me. The ladies leading it were great, there were 8 of us attending. My kit had an Olay moisturizer, an OPI nail polish, a few Chanel items (lipstick, cover up and foundation) and some nice eyeshadows and blushes that weren't really my colors, but were fun to play with. I learned how to draw on some fake eyebrows before I lost mine, and to perfect my eyeliner application, and to me, THAT was worth the time spent there. It is definitely worth attending, even if just to connect with others going through cancer treatment. tekwriter ~ you still have your hair on day 23? wow. Maybe you won't lose it all! Palo ~ I really hope you can get the Emend too! I can't imagine not having that. I get the 3 pack ~ one taken 30 min before infusion, and one for the next 2 mornings, PLUS I take Zofran as needed. I need to stay on top of my nausea with those meds.... I hope everyone is having a nice weekend. I just got back from a friend's 45th birthday celebration/winetasting party. It was fabulous and the DH & I bought a case of South African Cab to enjoy when this chemo is done :)   ",

I'm Wendy, 48 (but feel 23 still) living in San Diego with my hubby, 15 year old daughter and 8 year old son. I also started chemo this month. Jan 6th for 4 rounds of AC. I had my port-a-cath implanted the morning of my first chemo back in Apr '13 and I have to say I'm so glad I did it has made all the infusions, blood draws, etc so much easier. Especially helped with my MUGA scan ~ those IVs can hurt! I was originally dxd with triple neg st2 invasive ductal carcinoma L br in Jan of 2013. It was found during a routine mammo. They called me back for an ultrasound and needle core biopsy. I had a lumpectomy in Feb, no lymph node involvement. Started a clinical trial of Cytoxan and Taxotere in April for 6 cycles, 3 weeks apart. I felt like I had kicked this cancer's ASS! I lost my hair and my eyebrows (the eyebrows were the worst part!) gained 10lbs from the steroids, but I felt GOOD! I was at my double mastectomy pre-op appt with my surgeon and plastic surgeon to get all that pre surgery junk out of the way and mentioned that I had this nagging, unrelenting back pain that wasn't responding as expected to chiro, PT and massage. They poo-pooed me and said awww you're just anxious. I said I'm not anxious! I'm thrilled to be getting on with my life and having new perky healthy boobs! I insisted on an mri and 2 days later was given the bad news ~ St IV breast cancer had metastasized to my T4 spine. The worst part was waiting on the PET scan results. The tumor in my spine was the only spot they found. I don't think I've ever felt such relief. I had 10 rads in Nov 2013 and started my second fight with chemo last Monday. My worst day was day 6, but by day 8 I was up, showered, and driving my kids to school. I even shopped! Go me. I did lose 8 or so pounds but I do love to eat so that won't last long! So, not meaning to hijack this thread, just taking some time to post a little about me and join you ladies in fighting this with everything I've got. I'm really glad to have found this site. :) ",

Progression in T4 spine that will hopefully be treatable by Cyberknife, (had radiation last Nov on the vertebral body but they see residual in the T4 vertebral pedicle) and one new soft tissue lesion 4 cm to the Right of T4 that likely resulted from needle drag during my spinal biopsy last Nov. The fun never ends. It could always be worse, right? I'm staying positive. I cried a bit the last couple of days (mostly for my young kids) but I'm ready to tell this cancer to F*** off once and for all! I start radiation tomorrow on the soft tissue lesion. Ten days. Still waiting for my insurance to OK the cyberknife. In the meantime I'm on Prednisone and Norco for the pain. On another note ~ omg my hair looks like a poodle ",

It makes sense though, even the tiniest bit of acid reflux will burn that already compromised esophageal tissue and make it nearly impossible to swallow. It's awful. I hope it resolves soon. Mine lasted about a week. I lost 9lbs and I'm not very big to start with. I also had bad nerve pain from Taxotere. It did get better. In fact as I sit here I realize it's pretty much gone, and my last taxotere was July '13. I had trouble walking up stairs, holding things, my nails started to crumble, I had lower digestive issues (numbness). So don't give up on your nerve pain resolving. I would for sure go get an IV proactively. Once dehydration sets in, everything feels worse. Hugs, Wendy ",

I'm posting this here because although the ladies on my Jan 2014 chemo board are very supportive, I'm the only one there who is stage IV. I just got the official results of my PETscan from last week and I know you all will understand how amazing this is. NED has come to visit and hopefully to stay! No new mets and my met at T4 is resolved. They saw NOTHING of concern. So I'm over the moon with relief. My hair has started to grow back (I look a bit like a duckling), I'm feeling more energetic every day, my blood levels are all back to normal and I've had the OK from my onc to EAT SUSHI again. Woooooooooot! I haven't felt this normal in 15 months :) OK maybe normal is stretching it......... ;P Oh and hubby and I just booked a 10 day Hawaiian vacation to take the kids and show them where we met",
