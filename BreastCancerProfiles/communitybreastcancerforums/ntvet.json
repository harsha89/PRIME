      "Content": "ntvet wrote: Hi all, new here :).  Yesterday I found what I think to be a lump in the outer portion of the right breast/beginning armpit area.  I have pain here, sort of like stabbing needles, then it's dull for awhile.  I'm 25, and my great-grandmother died of BC when I was young; other than that, no other family history of BC. (*edit*: After some digging, I discovered my mom has cystic fibers) I have a Dr's appt scheduled for Dec 28...which is sort of a while off still.  The problem is that I'm currently finishing up a semester overseas, and get back to the States Dec 16.  With finals and everything coming up, I'm going out of my mind!  The only option I really have while still at school is to go to the campus nurse, who really won't be able to tell me anything.  What do I do??  How do I keep focus and not worry about this so much?  Thanks!
