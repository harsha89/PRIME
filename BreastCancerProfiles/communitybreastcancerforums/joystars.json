The surgeon and nurses recommendation was to be back to normal activity after the 3rd day of surgery and of course to take it easy and avoid any uncomfortable movement BUT always move, move, move. In my experience the first week was a bit hard to raise my arm, was only using half of it (from the elbow to the hand) and if I needed to wear make up, do/wash my hair, scratch my head or such I would tilt my head a bit to the left and lower it so my arm  could reach and wouldn't hurt. Today, after two weeks I still can't raise my arm up of my head (maybe I can but I'm afraid it will hurt or feel like pulling) so I'm not doing it. Not even when laying down. I can scratch my right shoulder or back with my left arm, but raising it completely over my head... nop nop. Oh and coughing or sneezing! aaaahh is painful as I feel like my chest is pulling the wound. Lizzymack, I so agree with you about encouraging other women and young ones to do a self examination AND mammo!. My friends, all of them under 30, have been adviced now.. they all are considering to get a mammo soon (especially the ones with some bc history in the family, any side mom or dad) seems like none of them wants to be in my shoes and certainly I don't want them to. I'm really greatful my aunt (dad's sis) BC battle three years ago opened my eyes and made me a more \"responsible\" person about self examination. And thanks to it and to being familiar with my own boobs, managed to detect that tiny \"lump\" last March. the rest is history now... I'm still waiting for the gene test results,  might take a while before I hear from them (around Nov - Dec) but I'm gald to know my sister, 27 yrs old, is getting a mammo once she goes back to Mexico.  ",

Sometimes I feel so sad some others I'm like \"Yes I can do it!\", esp. when I get to read such amazing and inspirational posts here. We still don't know the gender of the baby, still quite early. But in the meantime hubby and I got the first baby clothes: a new born pj's that reads \"Perro.Chien.Dog\" witha cute puppy's image. We think it's just peeeeerfect for our new bean as we are a mixed family and the 3 languages will be a must at home! :) Laurie, arrrghhh stupid disease we are dealing with! I've been reading about NH and seems you liev in a paradise place! Here in Oslo we also get few months of summer (more like just a couple of weeks of intense heat) and therefor EVERYONE goes out and strip themselves by the tiny ray of sun they can get. Trying to keep positive on this but some days I just fail! Too bad about the mani and pedi, I didn't know either and was considering getting one before surgery. Now I know. So far big plans before surgery are just a date with husband at a beautiful restaurant where we can have a view of lovely Oslo. That and relax and try to be as physicaly and emotionaly \"ready\" for this. Welcome to the new girls, Gunner and Seh, sorry to hear you have to join our boat. But just be sure this thread is full of wonderful people that have been so helpful and have always had a word or advise to cheer you up. Welcome again! Oh well in an update, past two days I've been a bitch. Crying and exploding at the singlest thing. I feel bad for my husband as he's the one who gets all my sh**! (sorry for my French :p )As I said before we both are expats, my mom and sister are planning on to arrive for the surgery to help me (and him) with the recovery process.... I just can't wait to have mammi here! Forgot to ask before, but girls who do share all your emotions, fears and ups and downs with?! I ask you this because my only partner in crime so far is my husband, I do have really good friends here and tho some of them know what we are going thru and have been amazingly supportive and understanding... I'm still on the \"I prefer no one to know\" stage. Denial?! Perhaps... but I just could not stand pity looks or stupid comments from people.... I don't wanna be a martyr either. So far everyone knows I'm preggo, but almost no one knwos about BC. I feel bad as my hubby has no one to talk with, he's always here with me 24/7. His friends here are more like party ppl who might not understand the whole thing, everyone knows about the baby but no one knows about the BC. At work they gave him the chance to go on \"sick leave\" for all the time we need. He'll be paid normal no matter if he shows up or not at work. People at his work have been just great! *sigh* Somehow I'm just afraid one day he is gonna explode and say: \"Enough you bi@tch!\" (again, sorry for my bad language!)",

Life goes on. The past 4 years have been filled with different changes,  beautiful memories, traveling, birthdays, and my daughter is soon to be 4! I started to work again, we are still in Norway and I never got that implant for a new boob done... well at least not yet, but I'm pretty happy with the foobie from Amoena. So yes, blessings to you all brave girls from the June Mastectomy 2010. Wish I could meet you all in person one day.... Take good care! :)",

      "Content": "joystars wrote: Hello everyone! I'm 29 yrs old. I'm 10 weeks pregnant and been diagnosed with cancer stage I, DCIS II &III. All started about three months ago when I found a lump in my left breast, after going to my general doctor he adressed me to the University Hospital in Oslo, Norway where I live. After mammo, ultrasound and biopsy, a 6mm lump was found and tested positive to cancer. Of course during this whole situation it never crossed my mind I was pregnant until few days before I had a lumpectomy when running a blood test revealed my hcg levels high high. Good and bad news came at the same time. Doctors have been so supportive ever since and asked me and my husband to take it step by step, we weren't sure we could continue the pregnancy. Lumpectomy was performed to know what we were dealing with (and of course expecting the worst as I'm in a high risk group: family cancer history and my age). Surgery went fine and lymph nodes were clean, so all we needed was to wait for the results about the tumor.. So last Friday we've been told good and bad news again, for me is amazing news to know the cancer is only stage one, that lymph nodes were completely clean but unfortunately the tumor they removed grew a lot (due my preganancy) and the margins were not clean :( Because of my pregnancy radiotherapy is not an option for me, so my onco has recommended a second surgery in ten days, this time to perform a mastectomy. After consulting with her team and other oncologists, they all have agreed that the best option for me and my baby is to go under this surgery, continue my pregnancy and have a c-section around week 30 -33 of pregnancy and right after chemo treatment will start (sometime around end of November). I need to confess I'm really scared, the idea of loosing a part of my body scares me so much The past months have gone so fast and so slow at the same time. I wanna keep my hopes up and fight this with all I have. Today after having the first ultrasound and seen baby's heart beating and hands moving.... I know I can make it! 30 yrs old, married to a lovely man, MOM of a lovely baby girl and hoping for the best. Dx 5/11/2010, DCIS, 2cm, Stage I, Grade 1, 0/1 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
