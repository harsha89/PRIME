I know I sound like a paranoid son but I want my expectations to meet reality, or at least be close. You got everything spot on!",

      "Content": "Jazzzz wrote: So my mum is 53, of indian descent She has her third surgery, the second one's results showed that doing one breast's amputation is ideal, to which we agreed. The cancer itself is in one breast, and 6 of the 13 nodes he found under that armpit, which he removed. She is now without those six lymph nodes and will be getting her breast amputated.  This is where my dead end comes, what does the amputation mean? If they're in the lymph nodes, wouldn't the amputation not take all of them out? I'm going to do guided yoga with her and calm her down as well as educate her, so please educate myself.  What are the survival rates? Log in to post a reply",
