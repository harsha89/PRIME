My liver has been enlarged off and on. When diagnosed, it was the worst. I started on Taxol/Avastin back in early 2009. You have quite a range of things you haven't had yet, but hopefully the Doxil will kick into gear and start shrinking that liver! I've also had Xeloda, Aromasin, Gemzar/Cisplatin, Ixempra, Gemzar/Navelbine. Am currently on Halaven. I think a second opinion is not  bad idea. I went to MD Anderson in late 2009 for one. Basically they were suggesting the same things as my local onc, but it was helpful to have another set of eyes on the problem.  Wishing you great success with the Doxil, Sending hugs, Paula ",

I failed Taxol/Avastin, Xeloda, Doxil and Aromasin. When I went back on Gemzar/Cisplatin (which had been on at one point for four rounds and had kept me stable), my tumor markers were at 1000. (Well, 997)... I had two scans while on that combo, and they were both stable, my tumor markers fell to just over 500.  I then switched (and am now on) Gemzar/Navelbine because the Cisplatin caused me to temporarily lose hearing in my left ear and it wasn't getting me beyond stable. My tumor markers have dropped to 400. No scans yet to see if the tumors (which I've never let him tell me how many there are) are following course. Gemzar/Navelbine together are very doable for me. I'm tolerating better than any of the chemos I've been on thus far in this latest journey or even the previous two. I'm way far from fixed, but I'm hopeful. I hope those drugs do well for you. I absolutely hate to hear your news. But don't give up on the chemos left to you. They could be the ones you've been waiting for. Giant hugs, Paula ",

Also, I believe there is a patient advocate/watchdog arm that is separate from the Texas Department of Insurance, should any problems or questions arise.  Also, I'm guessing you might be in Harris County? Check with their health department. Our much smaller county (up in here Waco) offers some prescription discount cards for eligible residents. It might not be much, but if the payments through the risk pool aren't very good, maybe it'd be a help. Surely if we have it, Harris County does. Hugs, Paula ",

I hope they are really just taking the time until Monday to make sure the radiologsts the have studying them know what's going on. With your nunbers being better, perhaps it really is stable or regressed in spots. Did the report come out and say one way or the other?  Hugs to you...  Paula",

I was wondering if this all happened because I had them reduce the decadron at infusion (you know, to see if it would help with the moodiness, the sleep troubles). But I guess it's really the Taxotere. I didn't have that when I was on it however many years ago. If only the diuretic could also get rid of lymphedema, I'd be set. When you guys get edema, does it make your legs feel like you're trying to walk through cement? I'm wondering if it's that or the neuropathy. I'm hoping it's the edema, because I'm supposed to be doing lots of walking on our DC trip in two weeks, and maybe the diuretic can make that SE go away.

Next? Whatever it is, I'm ready.  I hope you all find something to smile about today... Paula  May 2004, Stage 2 IDC. Recurrence in 2005. On Femara til mets diagnosis in Feb 2009. On Faslodex 8/11.

So far the diagnosis is Sudden Onset Hearing Loss, which basically means could be the Cisplatin or whatever else, they don't know. So, three weeks of Prednisone for me... and, naturally, an MRI of my head. Which I don't want to do. I'm so tired of scans.  Mom, I've never heard that \"lotion\" thing before. I think I'll try it. At least it can't have any really crazy side effects!  Paula ",

It's a fairly common procedure for those with hormone-positive cancers. They did not do the full hysterectomy, thinking they'd remove as few organs as were deemed necessary. Of course, having a early menopause isn't the optimal situation to be in for so many reasons, but when dealing with breast cancer, I guess it's just a \"best of two evils\" kind of thing. Having the oopherectomy allowed me to go on aromatase inhibitors, since the tamoxifen didn't work for me. Are your doctors suggesting you have surgery? Paula",

You might ask to talk to the researcher, too, to see if they have other patients using the pump and how they fare with small children, if any of them have it.  Hugs to you as you make this decision, Paula ",

I currently have a sinus infection that sounds a lot like pains you're having, tooth pain and so on. In fact, they found my brain mets while I was hitting the ENT up for antibiotics for sinus infection and what we thought was inner ear problems. Well, the sinus infection part was CORRECT, but unfortunately the wobbliness and loss of hearing was NOT the blasted inner ear thing.... As far as the sinus, I know when my back top and bottom left teeth start hurting (and then, if I don't act pretty quickly get the actual sinus area pain) that I'm probably in for another one. The last two times, the ENT prescribed amoxicillin, which works great for a little while but then the thing comes back.  Hope your doctor has a lot of great answers for you Monday. Paula ",

Counts were down as expected, but \"I'm still eligible for chemo,\" as the nurse said. Gosh, I wish I got a free lottery ticket too, or something, when I got bloodwork. I'd rather be eligible to win the lottery. The rest of the results weren't in yet. I guess they're waiting to see how the liver enzymes are, as I had one a bit high last time and Halaven is known apparently to mess with them. I'll also be interested to see if tumor markers came down any, altho I don't know if that's likely to show up just a week after the last TMs were done. I've been a little tired the last couple days, but nothing a well-deserved nap couldn't take care of. My son and I put up the tree last night (note to self: next year, just by a real tree not an assemble by numbers one.) Tonight, the fun part: ornaments. AFTER we go walk the dogs on this beautiful, warm day.  Our cat is loving the Christmas decorations coming out. She likes to pretend she's one herself. The drag? Looks like the sprouts of hair coming back during the weeks since I quit Ixempra are now falling out. Hair loss is sort of a 50-50 proposition on this drug, as far as I can tell. So I guess I'll be one of the have-nots. Jeanne, if you see this, how are your rads going? I know you said you'd be starting Halaven next month. I hope you're doing well.   Hugs to you all, Paula ",

So, I'm onto something else. Don't know what yet; my onc and I are discussing it and I hope also to talk to the doc who did my 2nd opinion at MD Anderson. Scarily, I asked my onc if it would be bad if it took a couple weeks to decide and he said it might be. Given that there is no easy option, I''m more than nervous.

That's exactly how I feel, various people I know sitting around talking about it. Who'd have thought?  I was on Halaven for four rounds and really had few side effects. A little fatigue, but nothing like I've had with other chemos (especially the dreaded Ixempra). My hair actually was growing back with Halaven. It was, for me, the easiest of the whole list of chemos I've done, which is pretty much all of them. We're all so different! I loved that it took almost no time to get. Alas, it also didn't work for me even tho it initially really dropped TMs (then they went back up).  If you really want to try Xeloda first, I'd press your doctor as to why he/she wants to try Halaven first. It is YOUR body. Is there a reason he doesn't think Xeloda is a good pick? Best to you all, Paula ",

I got one of the very rare (according to the drug co) SEs: Avastin created a hole in the septum of my nose.  I know the combo is often the first line chemo for mets.

Except today. Something in the mix of IHOP, ritalin (remember, I'm trying not to be hooked on hydrocodone pill every day) and coke Icee at the movie did not mix well.  Went to IHOP because I wanted to force myself to eat a lot, eating being something I'm not too good at making myself do. Ritalin for energy. Coke Icee because I was feeling reckless (and at movie theater prices, why not).  Otherwise, things are not bad. I still haven't made it onto the treadmill, but at least the hangers are off of it. Hope you are doing well, Paula  edited to add: The King's Speech is a very good movie; The Green Hornet not so much.  ",

And I hope you feel great on it  Glad to hear the news about the marker drop, Clemson. That is great news. I guess Halaven is going to be like every other chemo, works for some, not for others. But oncs do seem very excited about it.  My onc says there are two targeted therapies, one Imeltestat or something and the other I don't recall, right around the corner. In fact, the Imetelstate or whatever, is coming online soon for first-line mets. I guess they'll eventually get around to letting us second or ninth-line treatments get it eventually. Anyway, I'm going on and on, must be the decadron. (BTW, Taxotere, which I've been pushing my onc to go back to for a year, is the only one so far - with Carbo - to earn me a \"slightly smaller\" on my scan report. So, I'm all for pushing onc for what you feel at heart might work. Hugs to you, Paula ",

Was recently on Taxotere and have been dealing with some pretty major side effects from that bugger. But it did shrink things, so I guess I'll take the SEs to get the results. Had to leave the Taxotere because of the SEs and now am hoping Faslodex will work. Dang, Buttercup, ixempra and xeloda for two years? Those were BEARS for me as far as side effects. I'm so impressed!

It's been a really hard one for me as far as fatigue goes. Had scans after just two to see if we'll keep going, lower the dose, whatever. However, some women really don't have many problems with Ixempra. You know how it is, we're all different on different chemos.  I hope it does a great job for you. And even tho I find it hard, I hope it's worked for me, too! If you'll look back a week or two, you'll see dfleaman's post: she had done Ixempra since May and just had a scan that came back NED! That gives me a lot of hope.  Hugs, Paula  PS - Just got blood test results from this morning... Liver enzymes down to normal after being a little high for a couple months. And tumor markers are down 200 points in three weeks... So that's sounding pretty good! ",

I've found it quite tolerable, in the spectrum of chemos.  I hope they get that pneumonia under control and fix that kidney problem. As if you needed something else on top of stage 4. So glad to meet you and hope your scans continue to get better and better. That's very encouraging news. Thanks for sharing it with us. Paula ",

I did get my life insurance benefits accelerated and have the money stashed away for whenever we need it, for trials, anything else medical that comes up, a great trip we want to take, whatever. Also, the insurance company waived premiums to keep it paid for because I'm on LTD/disability.  Whenever I get around to doing my taxes (I got an extension), I am pretty sure I will qualify for the medical deduction. In order to get it, something like 7 or 8 percent of your income must go to medical stuff (meds, mileage, copays, the giant bills, etc). After getting such a pay cut on SSDI, shouldn't be a problem.... Well, remembering to keep all this stuff straight is a problem.  Good luck! Paula ",

Or perhaps your body just needs the rest  As for hair, I swear mine is growing back (lost it on Ixempra, last chemo). I don't think hair loss is a foregone conclusion on this one. My liver enzyme numbers (after two treatments, had no. 3 yesterday) were mixed. One was high (and has been there before). One was normal (after being high last time). Good news is that tumor markers were down nearly 100 points. Onc also said he could no longer feel my liver during physical exam, so it's gotten smaller.  Cancerkicker, I hope the fatigue lifts for you. I know that's hard. Best, Paula ",

I was popping protonix or whatever the generic is.  Just had dose 4. My hair, which was lost with Ixempra, seemed to be coming back. Now it's like it's just stuck, not doing anything. And it's not at a great place for that!  I had stomach problems over the weekend. Have had nausea with this on occasion, but this was more. Drug? Bug? But it has passed. Overall, not been the great last week. Lost a close college friend last week (it was a shock), sick on the weekend, went to the funeral yesterday then got rear-ended on my way home from treatment today. Luckily, no one hurt but dealing with the car will be a pain. Jeanne, I'm glad you got some energy back. Whoa! You did a lot!   Edited to add: After dropping 90 points last week, tumor markers skyrocketed this week (almost 200 points!). Doc says, don't worry, it's tumor flare, It's cells dying and flooding the bloodstream. I sure hope he's right.  ",

It's definitely helped at once a day, but I need more help on treatment day and the couple days after. So, altho I was officially \"retired\" as of Monday, I had junk to do the last two days. So tomorrow, after I get my son to school, I'm gonna go back to bed and stay there as long as I wish. Poor Nathan, his was the ONLY school in town that had school today because of the weather (which wasn't sleety like they forecast, but really really cold). I, of course, was also disappointed. But since I had to get up early to go to treatment anyway, I guess it was for the best. Maybe it'll make him even smarter. :) Crossing fingers, Halavenites....  ",

I, too, didn't succeed with Halaven, but after almost running out of chemos, went with Taxotere. Crossing fingers it's working; TMs at least are down.  I did go have another opinion at MD Anderson. Pretty much the same list of drugs, unless you are interested in trying out trials, which work really well for some of those who are on them. And of course you have to thank them for being bold and trying the trials But I was glad I went to MDA and have kept in touch with my doctor down there when it comes to choosing new treatments. i'm sorry the Halaven didn't work for you. Hope the Navelbine works greaet. i was on it with Gemzar and didn't think the SEs were too bad. Paula ",

      "Content": "PJB wrote: Good news, I think (never really really trusting Congress). And House expected to vote next week...  Senate Passes Bill to Speed Up Approval of Key Medicines By ROBERT PEAR WASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate on Thursday passed a major bipartisan bill to prevent drug shortages and to speed federal approval of new lifesaving medicines, including lower-cost generic versions of biotechnology products. A similar bill is on a fast track to approval in the House, perhaps as early as next week. President Obama, consumer groups and pharmaceutical companies strongly support the legislation. The measures reflect the government\u2019s effort to keep up with new therapies developed from a decade of rapid progress in biomedical research. After months of legislative paralysis and political sniping, the sight of Democrats and Republicans working together on a major bill was surprising. The Senate bill passed by a vote of 96 to 1; the only no vote was cast by Senator Bernard Sanders, independent of Vermont. The measure would increase the government\u2019s reliance on user fees, requiring makers of drugs and medical devices to pay $6.4 billion over five years to finance the evaluation of their products by the Food and Drug Administration. The bill reauthorizes user fees for brand-name drugs and medical devices and introduces fees for the review of generic drugs and less expensive versions of certain biotechnology products, known as biosimilars. The chief sponsor of the bill, Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, said the fees for generic drugs \u201care expected to slash review times to a third of current levels, from 30 months to 10 months, and will improve the speed with which generic products are made available to patients.\u2019\u2019 Mr. Harkin, the chairman of the Senate health committee, wrote the bill over the last 18 months with Senator Michael B. Enzi of Wyoming, the senior Republican on the panel. About 60 percent of the money for the review of new drug applications already comes from industry fees, which are used by the F.D.A. to hire scientists and buy equipment. If Congress does not act, the agency would have to lay off some employees. The bill would impose new requirements on drug makers to notify the government of potential drug shortages, which have become common in recent years. Federal officials would have to take steps to \u201chelp mitigate or prevent\u2019\u2019 the shortages, perhaps by finding other sources of supply, in this country or abroad. Manufacturers would also have to inform the F.D.A. before shutting down production of certain drugs. Senators of both parties said they had received pleas for help from constituents affected by shortages of drugs like cytarabine for leukemia, Doxil for ovarian cancer and methotrexate for various diseases. The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, said the concern was personal because his wife was being treated for breast cancer. \u201cThrough 20 weeks of chemotherapy,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Reid said, \u201cmy wife, Landra, and I lived with the fear that the medicine she needed every Monday morning wouldn\u2019t be there because there were shortages. Fortunately for us, the drug was always accessible. But many Americans have not been so fortunate. People die as a result of not having the medicines.\u2019\u2019 The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said, \u201cThis is an incredibly complex piece of legislation that strikes a difficult balance, protecting consumers while avoiding the stifling regulation that slows the process of bringing drugs and devices to market.\u2019\u2019 Democrats from states with thriving drug and device industries, like Minnesota and New Jersey, joined Republicans in saying they wanted to nudge the F.D.A. to accelerate the review of new products without jeopardizing patients\u2019 safety. The Congressional Budget Office said the bill \u201cwould lead to earlier marketing of lower-priced drugs,\u2019\u2019 reducing the average price of drugs in the market and saving more than $750 million over 10 years in Medicare, Medicaid and federal subsidies for private insurance under the new health care law. Over the next five years, the budget office said, the F.D.A. would collect $4.1 billion in fees for review of brand-name prescription drugs, $1.6 billion for generic drugs, $609 million for medical devices and $128 million for less costly versions of biotechnology products. The legislation sets performance goals for the agency, including deadlines that would reduce the time it takes for new products to reach the market. The goals were negotiated by the agency and drug and device companies. Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina, said this arrangement was highly unusual. \u201cTypically,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Burr said, \u201clegislation is crafted in Congress, not negotiated in the back room of the F.D.A. with device and pharmaceutical manufacturers. Congress is effectively shut out of the process until a deal negotiated behind closed doors is announced.\u2019\u2019 The bill would create expedited procedures for the review of \u201cbreakthrough drug therapies\u2019\u2019 for life-threatening diseases. It would create incentives for development of new antibiotics to treat infections caused by germs resistant to existing drugs. The bill also requires more frequent inspection of foreign companies that produce drugs imported into the United States; increases criminal penalties for the sale of counterfeit drugs; and requires pharmaceutical companies to keep track of each batch of their drug products from the factory to the pharmacy. After passing the drug bill, the Senate was expected to defeat separate Republican and Democratic proposals to protect college students against an increase in interest rates on federal loans. The rate is scheduled to double to 6.8 percent on July 1. Senators disagree on how to pay for the measure.  May 2004, Stage 2 IDC. Recurrence in 2005. On Femara til mets diagnosis in Feb 2009.

I was on Doxil for a few rounds, and while it didn't do much for me, I know it's a go-to drug that works well for a lot of people.  Have you gone the platinum route yet? (I'm currently on Gemzar/Cisplatin). While my liver tumors biopsied when I was diagnosed as Stage 4 and was strongly (90 ER/65 PR) hormone positive ,the docs are now treating me as a triple negative. My cancer is just not acting hormone positive anymore and the platinum drugs have apparently shown good promise in triple negatives. Can they biopsy again to check to make sure your status hasn't changed over the course of treatments? Also, found out today my onc's office is aggressively pursuing \"compassionate use\" PARP inhibitors for me to add to the mix. Have scans in a couple weeks to see how the Gem/Cis is doing. Hopefully, at least stable because nothing I've been on in the last 6 months has slowed things down.  I know you, too, have been through the wringer with drugs not working. Sending huge hugs and hopes for \"the next one\", Paula ",

I hope it keeps up and does great things for all of you.  Janny, I know what you mean about the leg thing. More than four weeks since my last tx, and I'm just getting rid of it. I still take pain meds before bed so I can sleep.  My onc prescribed Provigil for the incredible fatigue. It sort of helped sometimes, but it's very expensive. I did get a bit of an improvement after I asked for fluids one time a week or so after treatment. So I think part of it is I should have been drinking much, much, much more water.   Hugs to all, Paula ",

On Adriamycin and this year on Doxil, I used them and never got mouth sores. It was a tip I really appreciated it.  So do you guys have other tips that could help our sisters/brothers dealing with various chemo side effects? I'll start off with a couple that really hammered me: XELODA/diarrhea: Oh, it was bad for weeks. I started taking Prevacid, and my system seemed to even out.  GEMZAR combos (I\"ve had Gemzar/Cisplatin and Gemzar/Navelbine) and fatigue: At times during these treatments - which I now look on fondly if you can believe it - I'd get really zombie-like. My onc prescribed 10 days of 10 mg of prednisone. It helped. IXEMPRA/the pain: I'm a newbie to the drug I've dreaded since it was first suggested last year. Of the many problems I have with it, one is the really bad aching joints/muscles that seem to start about noon and last until I finally can fall asleep. I'd been taking Ibuprofen, but yesterday my nurse suggested Aleve before I go for the big-dog painkillers. It didn't completely go away, but was MUCH less noticeable.  IXEMPRA/The fatigue: I'm a week out of my first treatment, so I realize I have no idea what's really in store for me. I'm fortunate that now I'm on a month's leave, but I'm supposed to go back to work the day after my next treatment. So I really needed to try to climb out of the hole of complete fatigue. Now I'm on 100 mg of Provigil for most of my non-treatment days (can't be on it three days before or after tx, so I'm not sure how that's gonna work out. I don't think they want a zombie at work).   Anyway, I thought we could share some ideas as we all deal in our own ways with the awful side effects... Paula  May 2004, Stage 2 IDC.

With all the other chemos, thousands of people before me have shown us what the experience will be like, I was able to find out what course the SEs might take, knew \"tricks\" of things to take to try to head them off. Maybe some of you other sisters have already started Halaven? I'll be the first at the hospital I go to.

My onc at MDA (who I've seen just a few times but who keeps tabs on me, which I think is quite amazing) has a patient who's been on it quite awhile who supposedly finds it almost SE-free. And I find lots of inspiration from DFleaman, who had been on it for months when I was on it and who was NED after finishing it. The MDA doc says she has pretty much every one of her patients on it on a reduced dose and it seems to make a big difference in SEs.  Hoping it works like crazy for you and that you continue to get some relief, Paula ",

Obviously, since my liver had shrunk on Taxol/Avastin and my tumor markers had shown improvement, this was a horrible revelation. Fast forward to today, when my onc called (which he never does) to say he was troubled by the report so he went over the scans with the radiologist again. The verdict this time: stable, which sounded pretty good compared to yesterday's news. Still switching from Taxol/Avastin to Gemzar/Cisplastin. (Sounds like it's sometimes a pretty tough combo) I'm not sure who I'm most upset with: the radiologist who wrote the first report or my onc for not wondering about it earlier. You can bet next scan I'll be wanting to make sure more than one set of eyes has examined it. Anyone with words of wisdom on the Gemzar/Cisplatin, I'd appreciate it.   Paula  May 2004, Stage 2 IDC.

My son and husband sure give me a reason to fight it as best I can. I'd like to say I'm a mom who's running around taking her kid to a million sports and such, but my son tends to root himself at the computer most of the time. ( I know, I know, getting him to get out and exercise is on my list, just not so high) I take my drugs, deal with my sometimes horrendous side effects, make myself eat (which I don't really feel like doing most of the time, but it's high on my to-do list as a way to keep myself stronger) and even sometimes make something \"fancy\" for my boys (anything that involves more than 30 minutes of work, I consider \"fancy\") Mostly I try to distract myself on those days I feel the fear. If I start to feel myself pulled toward those feelings, I do something for ME (shop, read something funny or watch something I love) to get my mind to go another direction. I find if I start letting those thoughts out of their \"box\" in my head, they just keep flooding into my brain. (Oh, and if it's close enough to bedtime, I take an Ativan to stop my brain working overtime to add worry on top of worry and then get to sleep) But most of the days I don't, so much, feel the fear. I'm not going to let this crummy diagnoses take all \"good times\" from me. I've got it bad, but I know others have things worse - be it money, abuse, disease, any number of ways. After my 2004 diagnosis, I used to sort of seethe at the moms (and even friends) whose only worry really was making sure they picked their kids up on time and wore the right thing and liked to share all their accomplishments. Then I decided that was a waste of my time and energy. I've just this year gotten more involved in projects I care about to fill the days while my son's gone at school and hubby's at work (I \"retired\" from a fun and interesting job). Oh, and spend time on Web sites that I find fascinating or funny.  You might find some help overall in antidepressants, or maybe talking to a counselor to let all this out? Well, to help anyway?  And you'll hear great stuff from the folks here.  Just do the best you can for you.  ",

The onc did talk to my local onc about these treatments, and they both concurred. I wasn't looking for clinical trials at the time, and didn't feel I was being offered anything particularly cutting edge, so returned to my local onc. HOWEVER, I now also love my MDA onc. I haven't been there since early 2010, but my MDA onc has called me each time I've queried her about a treatment change. She has an incredibly busy schedule (so she doesn't usually call til 9 p.m. or so), but has called back every time and talked to me for probably 10 minutes each time.  The Rotary House was great, and the clinic moves with incredible organization. All in all, I recommend it. And, I've gotten the number for one of the clinical trial matchers, so I'll be calling her should my current treatment fail to help and probably arrange another trip down there. Good luck! Paula ",

The two drugs are doxorubicin and methotrexate, and in both cases supplies in the United States are being bolstered by shipments from abroad. Shortages of scores of other drugs continue. \u201cWe\u2019re not out of the woods,\u201d said Dr. Sandra L. Kweder of the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s drug center. \u201cBut these two particular shortages have been very, very upsetting to patients and to us.\u201d Dr. Peter C. Adamson, chairman of the Children\u2019s Oncology Group, which is financed by the National Cancer Institute, said he was pleased that the immediate threat of a methotrexate shortage had passed. \u201cBut this is at best a Band-Aid approach to the problem,\u201d he said. Shortages of both drugs developed when Ben Venue Laboratories temporarily closed its manufacturing facility in Bedford, Ohio, because it could not guarantee product safety. In the case of doxorubicin, known by the brand name Doxil, which is used to treat ovarian cancer, multiple myeloma and AIDS-related Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma, the F.D.A. has decided to allow temporary shipments from India of Lipodox, which is similar to Doxil, and is made by Sun Pharma Global. And the pharmaceutical company Hospira is rushing 31,000 vials \u2014 enough to last the entire nation a month \u2014 of preservative-free methotrexate, vital in the treatment of a common form of childhood leukemia, from its plant in Australia to the United States. Hospitals are set to receive the drug on Tuesday. The F.D.A. has also hastened approval of an application by APP Pharmaceuticals to manufacture methotrexate, an application that has languished since 2010.  May 2004, Stage 2 IDC. Recurrence in 2005.

I'm not happily carting this drainage \"briefcase\" around (and knocked it over twice yesterday) but it so much beats being stuck in the hospital.  Also get my Faslodex and Xgeva shots tomorrow while I'm down there to see the thoracic people.

My BC journey started 8 years ago, my mets journey just over 3 years ago. I have had pretty much every chemo out there, and my next step is trying to get Afinitor before we go back to the golden oldies that I've never heard of. I went from liver and bone mets, to now liver, bone and brain. I've had some months where I felt great, some months where I was completely out of breath and ended up having lung surgery because of pleural effusions that came about as an SE from Taxotere (wouldn't you know, that's the only chemo that actually shrunk the devils).   This is a very hard, frustrating, scary road we're all on. We've lost so many sisters before their time. And when to say enough is a very, very personal decision. I'd have a good long talk with your oncologist about all the things you are feeling. He or she should be welcome that discussion. If not, you've got the wrong doctor.  I hope the Halaven and Xgeva are working for you. Have you been on them awhile? Do you have scans coming up?  Is your doc's office good about taking your calls or emails and giving you help with the side effects? Hugs to you, and be sure to read the Halaven thread. There is lots of discussion on there about SEs and maybe some will help.  But know that you ARE strong. Your body is already being assaulted by the damn cancer, and then when you throw in toxic drugs.... well, it can only take so much! Let yourself rest as much as you can.... ",

Anyway, scan immediately after those three rounds showed everything the same, not worse, not better. However, I had tumor markers taken about a month after I quit that and they had dropped 300 points. So I think it was working... that the chemo still hanging around in there had helped. I found it to be very draining. I didn't have to skip any treatments, my bloodwork stayed fine. You do have to drink LOTS and LOTS of water. I swear I was waterlogged half the time. It did make me very tired. I tried Ritalin to a small amount of success...  I hated the steroids. I always warned my son that the days after Dexa were going to be my mean mommy days. My temper got bad quickly.   My hair did grow back pretty nicely from Taxol/Avastin while on this combo.  I'm wondering now if I should have stayed on it, not to be talked into switching to Aromasin... but that horse is out of the barn. I wish you great luck with the combo. It's one of the harder ones I've done because of the fatigue. But beyond that, I didn't really have any SEs.  Hugs, Paula ",

Here's hoping I don't have any roommates.  My wonderful oldest sister (all my sisters are wonderful - one is driving up from Houston for surgery day) who is the one we're supposed to fly to Florida with in about three weeks called yesterday. She said if docs still won't let me (and my son) fly, she and her husband will fly down here instead and DRIVE us to Orlando. How awesome is that? And my son's school is cool about him taking a week out of class if needed. I hate everything about this disease and all the crap it throws at you. But having a wonderful family and great support from all you guys on here really makes me realize how lucky I am in so many other areas of my life. ",

Mostly because it was really getting to me mentally (I feel a little bit like a baby now, but am so happy). So we shall see what happens with the pleural fluid this week. If it gets bad, it's another lung tap for me. Looks like all the biopsies and fluid tests came back negative for any cancer. Whew. I'm scheduled to have a Pleurx catheter put in a week from Friday since this surgery did NOT work. I guess it takes a lousy surgery to make that sound like a pretty darn good option. I came across a case study of 5 women who got pleural effusions from Taxotere. It took from 10-32 (32!) weeks for their pleural effusions to involve.  I'm glad I got the Taxotere, since it has been the only chemo so far (of pretty much all of them) to give me any regression. But, boy, this is a price to pay! Hope the week goes well, as I just realized yesterday that my son's birthday is this weekend!",

      "Content": "PJB wrote: BC-FITNESS-BREAST-CANCER-ART-NYT BALANCING PAINFUL SWELLING WITH A DESIRE TO EXERCISE By SUSAN BERGER< (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Nonsubscribers can purchase one-time rights by calling: 1-888-603-1036 or 1-888-346-9867.) c.2006 New York Times News Service= For almost 20 years, the prevailing wisdom among most doctors has been that breast cancer survivors at risk of contracting lymphedema � a debilitating, irreversible swelling of one or both arms � should avoid most upper-body exercise or lifting anything heavier than 5 pounds. For many women, the stern warnings meant they could not shop for groceries or even carry their children. Running and walking were safe, but anything that taxed the arms was considered dangerous. Women living with lymphedema received the same advice because of the concern that stressing their upper bodies would exacerbate their swelling, pain and stiffness. But a study at the University of Minnesota that was released this week contradicts decades of restrictions. It found that slow, progressive weight training did not increase the onset of lymphedema in breast cancer survivors who had had lymph nodes removed, nor did it worsen the symptoms of longtime sufferers. \"While current clinical guidelines say that this type of exercise may be harmful, our research indicates that it is indeed safe,\" said Kathryn Schmitz, an author of the study and an assistant professor in epidemiology at the Abramson Cancer Center at the University of Pennsylvania. \"More research is needed to know whether exercise prevents lymphedema, but there are physiologic reasons to believe that it might.\" The study, the largest and longest randomized one to date to examine how upper-body exercise affects breast cancer survivors at risk of contracting lymphedema, was published online Monday in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. The exercise group only increased how much they hoisted with their arms in the smallest increments possible. After six months of twice-weekly workouts, the 23 weight lifters found no difference in arm circumference and reported fewer symptoms than the 22 women in the control group. \"Doctors aren't telling women not to lift anything because they want to hold women back,\" Schmitz said. \"It is because lymphedema is one of the most poorly understood, hated and feared side effects of breast cancer treatment and they don't want to see women suffer. There is a need for caution, but we have thrown the baby out with the bath water.\" For more than a decade, many breast cancer survivors who feared lymphedema limited themselves to 5-pound weights. Others stopped lifting weights, choosing peace of mind over its potential benefits, like preventing osteoporosis. Of the roughly 2 million breast cancer survivors in the United States, 30 percent have lymphedema, estimated Dr. Joseph Feldman, the medical director of the Lymphedema Treatment Center at Evanston Northwestern Healthcare in Evanston, Ill. Research has only begun to confirm why some women develop the condition. Though it hasn't been proven, most experts agree that women who are overweight or who have had radiation treatments are more at risk. They also suspect that infection or an arm injury might cause lymphedema, as might cabin pressure during air travel. Cheryl Hogle, a teacher's aide from Minneapolis, felt discomfort in her right arm after a flight. The swelling got so bad that her fine motor skills were affected, and eventually she struggled to open twist-cap bottles. \"People don't understand that it is chronic, painful,\" Hogle, 55, said. \"And you can't hide a swollen arm.\" That didn't stop her from trying. She wore long-sleeve shirts when she jogged, unless it was too hot. After participating in Schmitz's study, Hogle regained full use of her arm. And now that she has worked up to 60-pound lateral pull downs, she carries groceries that she would never have dared to lift before. The study also validates what a handful of experts have practiced for years. Dr. Anne Rosenberg, a breast surgeon at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, said that she had found that patients who vigorously exercise their upper bodies do not necessarily have adverse effects. \"You have to do it cautiously,\" she said. \"But you can do it.\" Some women living with lymphedema have managed to do repetitive upper-body exercise in a way that doesn't aggravate their symptoms. Two years after her right arm became painfully swollen, Tracy Novak, a conference manager at West Virginia University in Morgantown, began to swim again with the approval of her physical therapist. Monitoring her arm for swelling, Novak started by doing the breaststroke for 12 laps and is now swimming 40 laps. Having bolstered her upper body, she is again able to help care for her boyfriend's daughter, who has severe cerebral palsy. In the last decade, Linda Miller, the director of the Breast Cancer Physical Therapy Center in Philadelphia, has found that patients who strengthen their arms controlled their lymphedema symptoms better than those who didn't lift weights. \"For years, I was spitting in the wind,\" said Miller, a physical therapist. \"This study is going to rock the lymphedema world.\" Some experts remain unconvinced. Although the Minnesota study was well-designed, Feldman of the Lymphedema Treatment Center cautioned that it only tracked women for six months. (Schmitz recently began a yearlong weight lifting study with 288 breast cancer survivors, half of whom have lymphedema.) Feldman said he would not start advising his patients to use weights heavier than 5 pounds until a study spanning several years was done. Exercisers should also always use a compression sleeve and have a lymphedema expert take their baseline measurements, Feldman said. \"Better to err on the side of caution.\" On the other hand, advocates of progressive weight training have begun to suggest that exercise may even protect breast cancer survivors against lymphedema, which is a buildup of lymphatic fluid under the skin. When lymph nodes are removed during surgery to gauge the spread of cancer, there are fewer nodes to drain the protein-rich fluid, and swelling can occur. But given that exercise enhances the flow of lymphatic fluid and improves protein reabsorption, Schmitz hypothesized in her study that it may help \"prevent lymphedema.\" Dr. Carolyn Kaelin, a surgeon and the founding director of the Comprehensive Breast Health Center at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, offered this theory. Slow, progressive upper-body weight training places a gentle stress on the channels that lymphatic fluid flows through, causing them to dilate slightly. She theorizes that the circumference of the channel may actually enlarge over time to accommodate extra fluid when there is an injury or stress. Because acute injury often triggers lymphedema, experts remain adamant that it is possible to overdo exercise. A doctor mistakenly told Elizabeth Warren, a personal trainer in Chicago who had had nodes removed, that she was so fit that she need not worry about straining her body. But in 1995 she experienced a burning sensation as well as swelling in her left arm after catching a 135-pound weight that a client dropped. The ordeal left Warren, 55, so devastated that she stopped lifting even the lightest weights. Her weakened upper body eventually became a problem. \"Because I lost muscle tone,\" she said, \"I kept hurting my arm.\" She now practices slow, progressive weight lifting, but she laments not being advised to do so earlier. If she had, Warren said, she might have avoided lymphedema or at least better managed her symptoms. May 2004, Stage 2 IDC. Recurrence in 2005. On Femara til mets diagnosis in Feb 2009.

I got an appointment pretty quickly, altho I didn't get one of the \"big name\" docs because of my schedule, which was changed at the last minute because of insurance quirks..... Also, at the time, I just knew I had liver mets and was going down there because they do ablation on more cases than my regional cancer center. But then, found out I also had bone mets, so they won't do ablation so really my options down there turned out to be pretty much standard treatments at this point. Anyway, I went down there and stayed at the Rotary International hotel that's attached to MDA. It's a time commitment.... four days at least for me both times I went there. Scans, tests, meeting with onc. She recommended I try Aromasin, which I did. Didn't work. Then Xeloda. Also didn't work. I was scheduled to go there again around Christmas (I'm about 4 hours away), but I opted to have my scans done closer to home since it seemed like I wasn't getting any really out of the box thinking down there and I wanted to preserve my Xmas holidays with my son and family. However, I still consulted with the doc down there on latest scans done here (as well as the doc up here) to settle on current tx (Doxil).... And I won't rule out going back down there if things don't get under control quickly. All in all, they make it pretty easy on you, scheduling-wise. The people all treated me very well.

After the first, I did get a few decent days. If you are doing quite well until Day 17, I'd say you're holding up pretty well!:) Much better than I did.  I told my doc I'd stick with it if it was doing well. Well, it did shrink them a bit (15 percent), but he thought that wasn't good enough given how poor my QOL was and when there was another choice (Halaven). As I told him, I'm willing to do it again because I'd rather be miserable than dead... I hope your scan show that all this you've been going through has worked wonders on killing those cancer cells. It's a awful decision to have to make. Hope you're feeling better today Sending hugs, Paula ",

And if they do end up getting this started down at MDA, it would make that awful Houston traffic a lot more palatable. :)  This from the Austin American-StatesmanBy Patrick George AMERICAN-STATESMAN STAFF Updated: 9:49 p.m. Monday, May 28, 2012 Published: 8:26 p.m. Monday, May 28, 2012 E-mail  Print  Share  Larger Type When David Woodruff arrived at St. David's North Austin Medical Center on a recent May morning, the hospital staff and patients in the parking lot had to pick their jaws up off the pavement. It wasn't Woodruff, an unassuming retired photographer dressed in slacks and a white button-down shirt, who drew their attention. It was how he got to the hospital that day \u2014 in a new, dark gray Rolls-Royce Ghost Extended Wheelbase. It's impossible not to notice the long, elegant-looking sedan with its huge grille and signature \"Spirit of Ecstasy\" hood ornament depicting a woman in a billowing dress. Ken Adams stepped out from behind and opened Woodruff's door. Woodruff went in for his treatment with a grin on his face. This was Adams' goal when he created Your Ride is Here, a nonprofit, volunteer-driven organization devoted to getting cancer patients to their treatments on time and in high style. An avid \"car guy\" and racing fan with an infectious laugh, the Dell project manager first came up with the idea when he was battling cancer about three years ago. When he left his chemotherapy and radiation treatments, Adams would see patients waiting on rides from friends, taxi cabs or city buses. Dealing with cancer is hard enough without having to worry about transportation, he said. \"I wanted to give back,\" Adams, 48, said. \"I said, \u2018Let's figure out a way to get people from point A to point B.'\u2009\" At first he contemplated a limousine or shuttle service, but then he decided that wasn't very exciting. Instead, he reached out to friends and fellow Austin-area racing aficionados, many of whom own exotic luxury and sports cars, and his friend Sonny Morgan, the dealer principal at John Eagle European in North Austin. Morgan's dealership has lent many of the cars used to take patients to treatments, and volunteers have used their own cars as well. The result: a patient who has been referred to Your Ride is Here may show up at a hospital or treatment center in an Aston Martin, a Bentley, a Mini Cooper, a BMW M5, a Ford GT, a vintage Camaro, or in at least one case, an ultra-rare Enzo Ferrari. The program has grown beyond Adams' wildest expectations, he said. They now have more than 130 volunteers and have expanded to Houston, where they will work with the MD Anderson Cancer Center. Volunteers have joined from area car clubs and Formula 1 watch parties, he said, and many of them have been affected by cancer in some way in their own lives. Adams said they plan on expanding into other cities, such as Washington, Chicago and San Francisco. \"I thought I would give a few rides and be done,\" Adams said. \"I guess that's not the plan God had for me.\" Patients are referred to Your Ride is Here by social workers, Adams said. The group operates solely on donations and volunteer drivers. Woodruff, who took photographs and edited videos for the Austin Police Department, was diagnosed with brain cancer in November. Two months ago he had successful brain surgery, and has been doing well with follow-up treatments, he said. The only problem, he said, is that his eyesight has been affected by his condition and he cannot drive. His girlfriend has to work, so she can't always take him in for treatments, Woodruff said. Your Ride is Here has given him several trips. \"It works great,\" Woodruff said. \"You're in and out and home. You don't have to wait on buses or cabs.\" The trip to St. David's in May was his first time in a Rolls-Royce. This particular Ghost, on loan from John Eagle European, featured a limousinelike interior with lambs-wool carpeting, two television screens in the front seat, hand-stitched leather and plenty of legroom. A 563-horsepower, V-12 engine quietly powers a car that rides so smoothly, it's nearly impossible to feel railroad tracks and other bumps in the road. Count Woodruff as a fan. \"This is the way to travel, isn't it?\" he said. Adams said he's ecstatic to see the program expand and receive such positive feedback. He said that it's one example of how much better his life is after cancer \u2014 his fight with the disease taught him to appreciate what's really important in life, as well as the joy of helping other people. \"This whole program has changed my life,\" he said. \"Ask anyone involved. They've gotten as much back from it as I have.\"  May 2004, Stage 2 IDC. Recurrence in 2005. On Femara til mets diagnosis in Feb 2009. On Faslodex 8/11. Brain mets in April 2012.

It's because the drug is so stinkin' hard to take!   I was able to go through only two treatments. We did scans and it had shrunk one tumor 15 percent. But I was NOT living, was not being a mother.

Ann, I found it really made a difference finding a \"good\" wig store where they have actual wig stylists. The last two times I've lost my hair, I've driven to Austin and met up with a dear friend. We've gone to the wig store and had fun (because my friend will try on some crazy wigs for her). Well, as fun as it can be. And the stylists pull out a bunch that look like they'll look good and you pick out some you just are curious about. When you pick it out, they thin it if it needs it and trim it as you like it. Make the cap smaller if you need it, etc. I still hardly wore mine last time unless I was going to be public, did scarves and caps and such. But it was good to have when I needed it. With summer in Texas, I'll probably hardly be able to stand it again.   Good luck! ",

I'll be shopping for some more options as soon as WBR robs me of my hair again.  So, here's my most amusing bald story. In 2005, when I had my first recurrence, I was on Taxotere and bald, of course.  That spring break, my friends invited me and my son to go to Park City, Utah, with them and one of their sister's, who had won a bid on a condo. Snow! Altho I'm not a skiier and my son had never done it, we were thrilled. So the first day on the slopes, my friends and their kids went off skiing. My son went to ski lessons (which he hated) and my friend's sister and I went to the bunny slope for the really, really beginner lessons. Basically, you take a moving sidewalk \"up\" this \"hill\" and get some lessons on how to go forward and how to stop. Then you get in line to practice. Well, besides the few of us older ladies, everyone else learning how to ski was about 2-4 years old. So when it was my turn, I started downhill. Seemingly far in front of me was a toddler and his personal trainer. The distance between us grew ever shorter - I'm sure something to do with mass and speed. Anyway, I was gaining on them. I shouted, waved my arms (no need for ski poles on the bunny hill) but they didn't hear or take my warning. Soon, I'm close behind. I had a decision to make. So, I fell down backward (the trainer scooted off, leaving her little charge alone), scooped up the toddler onto my chest so he'd be safe and slid down the hill. Eventually we both stopped and the kid's parents came to get him (terrified, no doubt, altho the kid seemed pretty unaffected), someone helped me up. I felt sweaty but also a little chilly, Sure enough, my hat - with hair still inside, was yards up the hill and I was bald as a peach.  I'm sure most were shocked, but I thought it was the funniest thing ever. I gathered my headgear and sat out the rest of the lesson. The last time I (or my son) skiied. ",

And I hope it works like gangbusters. Is it infusions? What do \"they\" say about side effects? I'm hoping scans will show next month that Taxotere is working (after about eight chemos that did not), but I'm always interested in hearing about trials.  Paula ",
