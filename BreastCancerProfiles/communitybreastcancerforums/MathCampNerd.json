I'm a 27 year old woman and I had just recently found a lump in my armpit. I've had cysts in my breast for years but they always said it was nothing when I got them checked. I just got the biopsy done in the to cysts in my breast and the lump in my armpit. Its come back as invasive ductal carcinoma grade 2. That's all the information I could really get from my GP. Shes referred me to the cancer clinic but it's the weekend so I'm just spiraling and falling prey to doctor Google. I'm just so scared so if any one could offer me any information or any words of encouragement I would greatly appreciate it. Log in to post a reply",
