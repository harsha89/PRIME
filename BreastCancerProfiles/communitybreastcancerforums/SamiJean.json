I cry because I know that others need time to digest and accept. I feel the tears well up in my eyes that have already begun to redden. My pulse races and I can feel and hear my heart as it beats in my chest. A knot forms in my stomach as I deliver the news. We reach out and hold one another's hand and squeeze as the words are said. When all is said and done, we embrace warmly with an extra strong and long hug. Tommy and I went to the oncologist today to discuss the findings of the latest bone scan and CT. They are as was earlier stated. Some small spots appear along my spinal cord, ribcage and lymph near my sternum, indicating metastasis in these areas. The tests did not show any metastasis of organs. Most concerning is the large 'rash' which started as small bumps around my surgical scar where my right breast once was. The bumps quickly changed into large red blotches which then quickly spread and joined to form one large bright red area with a deep purple color to the scar itself. I've been to two different ER doctor's on two different Saturdays because of blistering and a severe burning sensation. The first doctor appeared to think it was associated to the cancer, but gave hope and said that it maybe,, could be a skin infection. The second ER doctor gave hope and said that it appeared to be a streptococcal infection and prescribed antibiotics, dalacin (clindamycin) 300mg. I've visited the local doctor twice. The first visit (4 days after antibiotic treatment) was positive, as the purple color of the scar had greatly reduced and the yellow blisters were gone, as was much of the pain. We've celebrated Lucia and I attended the Holiday party for my work, but then... The weekend brought back more spotting and bigger blisters, intense burning and a very hard area that extends beyond the bright red blotch. I visited the local doctor again this past Monday. He was not happy to see that things were worse. he sent me to a skin specialist. I guess he was hoping, as my oncological nurse later told me she also hoped, that it was herpes zolster (shingles caused by a dormant chicken pox virus). The skin specialist was very kind and saddened to tell me that he was most certain that what we were dealing with was caused by the cancer. He suggested I first meet with the oncologist as planned and discuss treatment. However, if thought necessary, he would send me in for a cell biopsy. He promised to ring me on Tuesday. We met with the oncologist today at 13.45. We discussed the findings of the most recent scans, then she examined my chest. After some gently touching and poking and listening to my lungs and thumping on my back, we sat down to talk. The area is indeed an indication of the aggressiveness of the cancer. I asked her if it was IBC (Inflammatory Breast Cancer). She said that it appeared so. I asked her about statistics. She said that one can not give specific answer to individuals, as each person and their form of cancer is unique. I pressed her for a number and told her that I had read that in the best case scenario, the BEST case I read was 5, maybe 10 years, but not usually longer. I told her that with this burning mass on my side it feels as if I may not wake tomorrow or that I may be gone in a month, maybe two or three. She looked at me seriously and said that definitely not tomorrow and most likely not in a month or two, but three, \"I dare not say more.\" She went on to explain that it all depends on how the cancer I have reacts to the Taxotere (docetaxel). The hope is that the Taxotere will be able to slow down the growth. She would also like to move up my radiation treatments by several weeks to January, after the holidays. My next chemo treatment is scheduled for January 8 and we will again meet with this same oncologist. I asked about receiving treatments more often. The answer was that more frequent treatments means a lower dose of medication. She did not think that my immune system could tolerate another dose after 14 days. I asked her about seeking advice/treatment from hospitals in the USA. She said that Taxotere was currently the most useful medication in the fight against breast cancer. In my web-research, it is the medication that I have read about most often that is correlated to higher stages of breast cancer and metastatic breast cancer. She said that of course I should seek advice and do research that makes me feel comfortable and she encouraged me to discuss my findings with the oncolgist(s). I asked about clinical trials. I asked about going back to work. We asked about how we'll know that this new drug is working. We asked about what we could expect if it doesn't. So my dearest family and friends...that is were we are just now. It is serious. My time frame has been adjusted. As a small child, one does not even contemplate the idea of death. It is not yet a learned experience. One grows and inquires and examines nature: an animal on the side of the road, a bird that flies into a window, visits to the zoo... All these open discussions to the concept. Young children start testing their boundaries: climbing a tree, crossing the road by themselves, riding their bike down a steep hill.. Teenagers and young adults think themselves indestructible. They attempt daring and sometimes risky things. Still, one grows and experiences losses: a pet dies, a grandparent, a neighbor... More teachings. One grows older and becomes more stable. a job, perhaps a family, puts away some savings for retirement... Retirement nears and one makes new plans. travel, more time with family and grandchildren... Old age sets in and one begins to make other plans. It is a natural time to begin to think about ones passing. I will still fight the fight and say my prayers and cherish each day, but... I have to also look at the real possibility that my body is giving me clear signals that it is not well and requires much attention. Hopefully, the medications will slow down this monster raging inside. I want so much to be there for my husband and children in the years to come. God, I pray for advances in medication that will help. The tears have come. I hear and feel my heart beating in my chest. My nose is dripping and I scrabble to find a tissue. I need my strength for the fight. Oh, no not I, I will survive, Oh as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give And I, I will survive. I will survive!!
