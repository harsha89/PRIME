So, I woke Sat morning from extremely sharp pain in my breast. When I touched my breast, I felt solid hard lump size of a tangerine. It was definitely not there the night before. Since then it has been growing quickly in size. Surface of breast is pink, tender, and warm to touch. I'm also noticing sharp pain behind my nipple and its becoming inverted. Since initial finding, its about 3 times larger now, which covers about 1/3 of my breast. It feels very heavy and im finding myself unable to wear a bra since it leaves strange indentation. Even though my appointment is in couple days, I find myself already panicking over the whole situation. Log in to post a reply",
