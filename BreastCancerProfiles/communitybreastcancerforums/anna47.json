He said it is easier to put in and can be taken out in the dr office when I am finished with chemo. ( Doing 4 cycles TC) Anyone have this type catheter? and how difficult is it to take care of? I heard you have to go into the onc office each week to have it flushed and redressed (because it stays covered).  Any info would be great. I am having it done tomorrow.

I told the nurse that I did not want any bp or needles in my left arm because of previous lymphnode removal. She asked, why? I told her that I had some minor swelling problems since the surgery which ws possible lymphedema and that I was seeing a therapist to treat it. I did not want to aggravate a problem I already had. She had the nerve to tell me that now days most doctors believe lymphedema to be an old wives tale!!!! AARGH!! I told her that it didn't matter what she thought or any doctor thought - this is my health and I'm taking control of it and I DO NOT WANT BP OR NEEDLES IN MY LEFT ARM. If it were your problem you would feel differently.  She finally marked my arm before surgery. I also wrote this request on my registration papers and told the anesthesiologist the same thing.  When I went into the operating room they tucked my left arm to my side and I felt the bp cuff go around my ankle/calf before I went out.  No problems.  But we do have to fight for our own rights. Truly frustrating!",

I also have the nerve sensations- burning, tingling, sensitivity - underneath my upper arm. I still have some swelling and am seeing a certified lymphedema therapist. I have a compression sleeve and glove that I wear every day for now. I do stretching exercises and have lymphedema massages 2X a week for now. I also have a lot of tightness all the way around my affected shoulder and into my breast area. It almost feels like a vise around my shoulder/arm. Is this normal after surgery or is it the mild lymphedema I'm experiencing? My range of motion has improved and the swelling has reduced in my arm, but I still feel really tight around the shoulder. Anyone out there experienced that feeling? and does it get better?",

I too am planning to have the port put in before chemo starts. I am assuming we will start in March but some of you said you started right away after seeing the onc. Maybe I will start in Feb. Everything is so unknown right now. I did receive a \"goodie\" bag from a friend and was told to use it to carry whatever I needed during chemo treatments. For example, a book to read, water, puzzle books, Ipod, etc. ...whatever will make me comfortable during treatment. I also heard that treatment can take 6-8 hours! Is this true? I didn't realize it would take a whole day for treatment. I thought a couple of hours at most. Can you have someone there with you? I guess these are all questions the onc will answer once I meet with him. Good luck to all you ladies starting chemo this month. I'll keep you all in my prayers.",
