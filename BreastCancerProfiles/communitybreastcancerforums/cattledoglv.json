I have several areas of enhancement on the left he wants to keep an eye on (mri/US every 6 months), and two of which lit up hyperintensly on T2. I also have three LN, same side as enhancement, which were 2.0/2.2cm on mri for many weeks, possibly months, without change, but a bit larger on US. They wanted me to come back for a non contrast MRI for suspected implant ruptures due to severe pain I have on the right and the nodal involvement, and the keyhole sign (implant rupture sign) on the left as well as a palpable lump that no one can find on any imaging. I felt it, husband felt it, and dr felt it. Machines can\u2019t find it. I had another breast MRI and US today. Today, my 3 nodes were too big to even pick up the whole area on MRI as they were partially out of field it said, I have not been sick and no injury. US measured them at 3.2cm minimum but she couldn\u2019t find the posterior edge of them there is so much distortion, which makes sense since I can now feel them and feel like I have huge grapes in my armpit and they are now tender. Can LN grow by 50% + in two weeks? New MRI Did not show extracapsular rupture but only intracapsular on left. No reason shown for pain on the right but RD said probably contracture. Incidental to the breast issues they found a hyperintense punctate lesion on my sternum measuring 3mm that was not there 18 months ago during a chest X-ray. They initially said it was a bone island, then today, said they misread the last report, and now think it\u2019s a hemangioma, which is extremely rare on the sternum. In fact, there is barely any literature or case facts on this says pubmed. The info they do have isn\u2019t very positive as most of these require surgery if that\u2019s what they are. Most sternum lesions are malignant is what scares me. I have had mild to severe sternum pain for about 6 weeks, and yet, this is only 3mm. My regular dr is not convinced this is just some b9 thing with my symptoms and ordered a chest X-ray with focus on the sternum. I\u2019m frustrated because the RD, even knowing my history with cervical cancer, ADH, these several enhancements, dense breasts, nodes, chest pain, and breast pain, has nothing to say about this lesion and says it means nothing and says he\u2019s sure everything is b9. It just feels like it\u2019s all too much to not be related. I guess I just need to vent cause I feel like I\u2019m getting the run around. If someone could just let me know what they think if they have any experience with this. It feels like there is so much going on!

I had been having pain in my right breast and nipple, like bee sting pains for several months. All of the sudden, one day, I felt a lump under my nipple. It felt pretty big. Went to my primary and she felt it and sent me for a diagnostic mammo. Mammo came back BiRads 0 needing more info. Had an ultrasound that day. Found lump. Dr didn't like the way it looked or the fact it had grown so fast and caused pain. BiRads 4b. Had a biopsy, where he took out many many samples that came back a fibroadenoma. Whew! I was relieved! It still caused pain tho so I asked if they could remove it. I was going on vacay and had stuff planned for the summer so they said they'd take it out end of August. I have the \"lumpectomy\"(that's what my dr called it) the end of August, and a few days later I see my surgeon for the check up. she sits down and tells me that she's shocked by my pathology. I had \"atypia\" throughout the tumor. It grew fast! She then used that stupid computer risk assessment tool for breast cancer and said my increased risk was ONLY 4%. I didn't know what atypia was and she's didn't explain any further. I just said glad I had it out and that was that. I had to go in for my annual screening mammo a few weeks ago and then had to have diagnostic and US again for a lump and lymph nodes. Only then, did I start looking up atypia in breasts. Well, I saw two types that were specifically called atypia. FEA and ADH. I was hoping I had the FEA... Today, I finally asked my primary which one I had while she rushed around trying to get me an appt with my surgeon, who's booked for ages, since I guess I have three lymph nodes about an inch by just over half an inch big and another lump on the left that can't be seen by mammo or US. The lymph nodes are going on three weeks now and only got bigger. So I'm pisssed that this wasn't really taken seriously by my surgeon. I have implants and \"extremely dense\" breast tissue which makes mammos very difficult to read and the extremely dense tissue makes BC hard to see and makes me at higher risk for BC in the first place. I spoke with my PS and he said he'll meet with me after I figure out what's going on with my nodes and and lump. He recommended an MRI. We talked about doing a breast reduction (I normally have a C cup without implants) and smaller implants to make reading mammos easier and to reduce my risk by lessening the amount of breast tissue. I read a report from the New England Journal of Medicine that is pretty recent, and their study on ADH said that overall risk for women with ADH is 30% of getting DCIS or IDC within 25 years after the ADH. That's A LOT higher than my dr said. If you want to read the study search ADH and New England Journal of medicine. Oh and I started this crappy journey at 38. I'm now 39 which I guess increases my risk even greater since I was diagnosed before 45.",

Something just occurred to me and I winder if anyone else had similar mouth issues before being diagnosed. So I went to the dentist for inflamed/bleeding gums and generally a painful mouth about one month ago. I've never had any issues with my teeth or gums in the past. The dentist, a woman, asked me if I had any immune issues because this kind of flare up can be a symptom of an immune response, especially in women she said. Of course, at the time, I thought nothing of it and said no. Now I wonder if that was my body trying to talk to me. Can I get some prayers for good results??!! Thanks!!
