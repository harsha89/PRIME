She told me to tell them this will be my 2nd mammo and to get me in as soon as they can. The office that made my appointment 11 days from now did not have my records on them. I just spoke with the scheduling deparment. So I have no way of knowing if it's urgent or not. What excatly is DCIS? Is this common with calcifications? Is that what you have? I hope you are doing well! Thank you again for your concern!",

(I literally joined and posted a minute later so I'm not sure what i'm doing yet) Anyway, I would love to hear all of your stories, what you are going through now and how you're doing. Luckily, I have some Xanax and I took one promptly after the results came in. My hands were shaking for over an hour straight and my mind has just been racing. Thank you all for your support and quick responses. This site has been a great help already! By the way, are calcifications hereditary? My mother has them (she's 71) and they are all benign so I hope for the best!",

I just got a call today saying that they found \"tiny calcifications\" on my left breast. They scheduled me at another office for a second mammogram but it's not for another 11 days from now! I will be calling every day starting tomorrow to see if they can get me in earlier. Anyway, I know nothing about this but the nurse told me 80% of these are benign. Well, that still leaves me with 20% that are not. I read up on these \"tiny calcifications\" and it looks like the small ones like these have more chance of being cancerous. Can anyone help me with this, I'm a nervous wreck and have very little knowledge about \"calcifications\". Thank you for your time! Log in to post a reply",

My xrays are a Birad 4. I am scheduled for a Stereotactic Core biopsy tomorrow. They said 80% are benign but 20% are not. I am very scared. I had posted here a few days ago after my first mammo and was hoping it wasn't going to come to this. Has anyone else had the \"clustered microcalcifications\"? I have read online that these are the worst kind. I'd like to hear peoples outcomes. They kept saying \"don't worry they are very common\" but I will have to see.  Please help!!!!!!!!!!!!
