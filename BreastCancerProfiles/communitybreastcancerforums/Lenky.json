      "Content": "Lenky wrote: Hi everyone,    I need HELP.   I'm having problems after my mastectomy (April 23rd) - I have good movement and am now sleeping quite well and can drive short distances, but feel that the pain under my arm and side is holding me back.      I can't wear a bra for any time at all.   Even wearing sleeveless tops causes problems around the armholes.    It feels like rubbing sandpaper across my skin and it's so sore.     I have started a wider range of exercises the last couple of days and I think it is starting to help but - still no bra.    I can feel the swelling on my arm catching against the swelling on my side.    I'm wondering if that is because I had an expander put in at the same time as my op plus 200ml of fluid (so I have a kind of pocket where my breast used to be) - plus the fact that I'm left handed and lost my left breast.      Has anyone had this problem and what helped you through it?     Thank xx Log in to post a reply",
