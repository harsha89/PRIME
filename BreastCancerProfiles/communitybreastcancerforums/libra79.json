It all start before thanksgiving I was feeling pain in my left armpit near my breast ending up going to see the doctor he felt something to and ask if I ever had a mammogram I said no he ask was there I family history I said yes my mother and aunt (my dad sister). So he wanted me to schedule a diagnostic mammogram, ultrasound, and make a apt. to see the BS.  so my mammogram and ultrasound was done on dec. 4th 2014  results: BI-RADS 4-Suspicious abnormality biopsy   the breast parenchyma is heterogeneously dense there was no evidence  of suspicious  mass a few benign appearing lymph nodes in the left breast there is a persistent micolobulated subcentimeter nodular asymmetry in the outer right breast approx. 8cm from the nipple only seen on cc view no clear correlate is seen on mlo or true lateral view. On the ultrasound it showed likely correlating with a nodular asymmetry in the outer right breast is a suspicious irregular hypoechoic solid nodule with the angular margins in the 11 o'clock position measuring 0.4x0.5x0.3cm also in the right breast a low suspicion wider than tall slightly irregular hypoechoic solid mass in the 9 o'clock position measuring 1.4x1.6x0.8cm. Had a ultrasound core biopsy on dec. 12th doing the biopsy the doctor didn't seem to be to concerned but I am  suppose to get the results on dec 19th this has been the lasting process of my life it seems the stress is killer is there a chance that it could be cancer even if the doctor was to concerned isn't it all in what the pathology report says... sorry to write so much but wanted to let u all know what is going on.   Log in to post a reply",

In December I was diagnose with two  fibroadenoma at the 9 and 11 o'clock positions went  last wk for a follow up ultrasound and diagnostic mammogram and they say something else at the 10 o'clock position. I feel ur concern they wanted me to wait for six months to see if there was any changes because they felt it was also a  fibroadenoma. But I am one of those person tht wry abt the smallest let things so I opted to go get a second opinion because I felt like six months is a long to be waiting I wnted to get a biopsy for it too. So the second doctor ended up talking  the radiologist so now I will be hving a biopsy which makes me feel a little better so if u feel tht getting a second opinion will ease ur mind I say do it",
