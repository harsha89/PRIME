I had four dose dense A/C treatments and twelve weekly Abraxane treatments. I read horror stories about A/C but it didn't effect me that much. I was tired but not exhausted. Never got nauseated either. I did get some mouth sores but used warm salt water and they only lasted about two days after each treatment. The same went for Abraxane. I did get what they thought was cellulitis so took Bactrim and it cleared the reddened area. It did however give me C Diff then I relapsed four weeks later. Ugh. But that was caused by the antibiotic, NOT chemo. The C Diff was the hardest part for me and I still have post traumatic stress from it. Every time I get an upset stomach I panic. It's ridiculous but a reality for me. Anyway, enough about that. Stay on top of the nausea meds and wash your hands like crazy. Eat well, rest often and drink plenty of fluids. I did and I was able to do most things I always did, including eating out and going places. I only took the nausea pills for around four days after each A/C treatment and like two after each Abraxane treatment. We are all different though so you will just have to do what's best for you. Keep us posted. You will be okay!",

She says my chances of infections from cuts and bites are low because I only have slight LE and only had two nodes removed.  I don't have antibiotic ointment like Neosporin because it burns my skin. I do carry band aids and antibacterial wipes with me. I also carry alcohol wipes and alcohol based hand sanitizer. If I didn't get C Diff I wouldn't be scared of antibiotics. If I ever have to take them I have to take Vancomycin for a day before starting other antibiotics and I have to take that when I'm on antibiotics then continue the vancomycin 7-10 days after finishing the other antibiotic just to try to keep from getting C Diff! It's a mess. My husband has been sick for a few days and he started running a low temp today! So I'm scared he has something that's bacterial that I can catch. He thought it was just a chest cold. So we've been sleeping in the same bed and everything and he's been coughing like crazy. My doctor checked him today but didn't give him antibiotics. She said his lungs sound clear but he had a little fluid behind his right ear drum. His temp wasn't up this morning when she saw him though. Ugh!  Anyway thanks again!",

Both my LE therapist and doctor told me that the increased risk of infection is only in my affected area. I have slight right truncal LE. So if I get a cut or whatever anywhere on that side, does that mean I have to worry about cellulitis until the wound heals? Will I get cellulitis for sure if I get a cut, bug bite, or an injury like a bruise on that side? Do I have to worry as much if I get something on the other side of my body? Also I thought cellulitis developed only in the area where the cut was, but after reading posts here it seems like if you get a cut somewhere the cellulitis can start somewhere else! Is that correct? I am just terrified of antibiotics because of C Diff issues. On the other hand though if you don't get antibiotics you would die of cellulitis. I'm also allergic to lots of broad spectrum antibiotics, even Keflex! I have had several mosquito bites, etc, and so far no problems. But I do panic over rashes and other things! Some days it seems like I'm more afraid of the potential problems of LE than I am of cancer recurrence:mets! Can anyone pleas educate me more on cellulitis, and possibly ease my mind any at all?

      "Content": "Sep 30, 2014 08:46AM - edited Sep 30, 2014 08:53AM by Luvmydobies C Diff is an intestinal infection usually caused by antibiotics because they wipe out the good bacteria in your gut and the c diff spores take over. It causes severe diarrhea and can be deadly, can cause sepsis, etc. There's only a few antibiotics that will get rid of it and some have to get a fecal transplant. So it's very scary, because it's hard to treat. Some people have several relapses. Any antibiotic can cause it. So it's not cellulitis I'm worried about catching from my husband, I'm just worried he might have something that I can catch requiring antibiotics because I'm terrified of them now. Plus I'm allergic to a lot of antibiotics. I'm not on chemo anymore, but I constantly worry about infection because CDiff scarred me for life. I was hospitalized for it twice! It's also contagious but not airborne. Bleach is the only thing that will actually kill the spores. C Diff can also be caught in the hospital because it's so hard to kill. My infectious disease doctor said it is a super bug. If you're in the hospital the doctors, nurses, and visitors have to use disposable gowns and gloves before entering the room and they throw them away before leaving the room and scrub their hands to avoid catching it and to try to keep it from spreading it outside the room. Vigilant hand washing is the way to keep from spreading it but if nurses and doctors don't take proper precautions they can easily give it to someone else in the hospital. Anyway, just a little info for you. Also with all this said C Diff is fairly rare. Don't want to scare anyone!  I have already been exposed to whatever he has so I am sleeping in the same bed as he is in case he needs me in the middle of the night or something. He says he's ok. So far his fever has only been low grade so hopefully it's just a viral infection.",

The PCP I saw told me BC isn't likely to skip the axillary nodes and go to the nodes near the elbow area (cubital or epitrochlear nodes). Whatever it is I feel isn't hard really. It's kind of in/below the crease. He thinks what I feel is a tendon and muscle tissue. I'm still nervous about it to be honest. I saw a few YouTube videos of lymph node exams on people and the doctors felt above the elbow but more on the underneath side of the arm. With yours being small like rice I highly doubt it's a lymph node. Keep us posted.",

I wasn't aware of that when I was diagnosed. I was like ok I'll have treatment then take a pill for 5-10 years and all will be well. Boy, was I wrong?!! Also when I felt my lump two years ago at age 36, I was like it's not cancer I'm not over 40 yet and nobody else in my immediate family had breast cancer. Wrong again! Then after surgery and we found out it wasn't in my lymph nodes I was like that's  great, it won't come back or metastasize. Well at this moment they think I'm NED but obviously that can change in the blink of an eye! Also I was like after treatment I'll put this behind me and get on with life. Little did I know that after treatment is when a lot of survivor's including myself have a very rough time.  It's so frustrating that there's not enough research for the more aggressive/rare types such as Triple Negative. Being a Triple Negative girl myself I get really mad that there's no targeted therapies for my type yet! It sucks no matter what kind you have, and I do pray for a cure for ALL of us, but hearing there's nothing they can do for you after completing chemo and to just hope for the best is a VERY HARD pill to swallow! I am grateful for each day but it's just exhausting thinking every ache, twinge, cough, rash, crazy period, etc. is cancer or some kind of crazy infection! I have to be careful with antibiotics too because I've had C Diff three times, which I probably would have never gotten if I didn't get cancer. Aargh! Sorry for the little rant. Just mad they don't have a cure! I also agree with rettemich that October should be a find a CURE for all types of cancer month.",

It also says on the paper that comes with the Florastor to check with a doctor before using if you are taking chemo. I've heard also that it helps with C Diff.  I did take it with my first bout of c diff and I got over the c diff fast. That was before I started chemo though. Like you say always check with a doctor before taking things.  TJ how're you doing?",

      "Content": "Sep 12, 2014 04:06AM - edited Sep 12, 2014 04:10AM by Luvmydobies TJ, Clindamycin is a bad antibiotic. It gave me C Diff. I also read a lot about it on a c diff forum. It is notorious for causing c diff. Someone also told me there's a black box warning on it. I've actually had c diff three times and Clindamycin is what started it. Once you get c diff you are prone to it again. If you don't know what it is, it's a horrible intestinal infection that is very serious and very hard to cure. Some don't have problems with Clindamycin but my own PCP said she didn't know why they didn't take Clindamycin off the shelves. Any antibiotic can cause c diff but ones like Clindamycin, Cephlasporin's such as Keflex and Quinolone's such as Cipro are supposedly the biggest culprits. They say C Diff is rare but it's becoming more common and it is a super bug, according to my infectious disease doctor. I'm terrified of infections now because if I take an antibiotic I'll most likely get C Diff, so IF I do get a bacterial infection then I have to take Vancomycin with whatever other antibiotic they give me and for seven days after just to try to prevent C Diff. Enough of my rant about C Diff, sorry, so yes like Kicks said call a doc ASAP! So sorry you're having so much trouble.",

She just said she's heard of so many getting C Diff from Clindamycin so she didn't know why they didn't take it off. There is also a black box warning on it. I am allergic to penicillin, cephalosporin's and Cipro so yes there is a need for certain things. However C Diff can also cause a systemic infection and sepsis, so for ME personally C Diff is very scary. It was by far the worst thing during my cancer treatment, and there are only a couple of antibiotics that they use to treat C Diff. Some even have to get fecal transplants. I have bad anxiety about C Diff just like I do about cancer, so it's like a double whammy for me.  I wasn't telling TJ not to take it. She asked about it so I was only telling her my experience and what my doctor told me. I'm so sorry if I ruffled any feathers. That wasn't my intent. I just hope TJ can find relief soon. She's been through a lot lately. Sorry for the rant. I just hate what all of us ladies on here have to go through because of freaking cancer! Ugh! TJ keep us posted and hang in there!",

I was going to edit it and tell you not to let my experience about Clindamycin scare you. I was going to edit my first post too and say Clindamycin may not agree with everyone instead of saying it's a \"bad\" antibiotic. You SHOULD take it if it was prescribed for you because infection is worse than a possible side effect of a particular antibiotic and your prescriber obviously thought the benefits outweighed the risks. My doctor saying it should be taken off the shelf was ONLY her opinion. Any medicine has potential side effects. We probably wouldn't even take Tylenol if we read all of the \"possible\" side effects. So with all this said contact your doctor to find out what's going on, take the meds and I sincerely hope you are ok. Keep us posted. Also to add my doctor also said taking probiotics will help with any tummy upsets while on antibiotics. Ask yours what they recommend though. ",

I'm terrified of infection because I've had C Diff THREE times due to antibiotics. My therapist tells me it increase risk of infection (cellulitis) but she says my chances are low because I only had two nodes removed, BUT I'm still diligent about keeping cuts and bites clean and still panic when I do get a scrape or something in that area. I do MLD once and sometimes twice a day.  I wear Spanx shirts either at night or during the day for now and I'm hoping and praying it doesn't progress where I have to have actual truncal compression. I also wear a sleeve and glove when flying in hopes of it not developing in my arm. I also use the sleeve and Spanx when exercising. I too get depressed and some days am not motivated to do anything. I still cry every day too! It just sucks! FU cancer and FU LE!!! Hang in there Mariasnow!",

He did a thorough exam and felt around on my abdomen for awhile and did a percussion test there and on my back. He also listened to my lungs and did percussion on my back. He said all felt and sounded normal. I also mentioned it to my PCP and she didn't seem concerned either. She did a pelvic exam and didn't feel any abnormalities. I am scared of infection because of antibiotics. I've had C Diff three times so that's why I'm scared of antibiotics. I do see her again tomorrow. I'm also terrified of bladder mets. My mind is all over the place thinking bladder, vaginal, liver or even brain mets! So I'm having a rough weekend. Anyone have anything weird like this before and it not be anything major?

I ate pretty well and was very active before I was diagnosed with Triple Negative, so sometimes I'm like my healthy lifestyle didn't keep me from getting cancer the first time, so will it really prevent it from coming back? When I was going through treatment I got C Diff three times and my Onc was like well you need to eat what you feel like because you don't need to lose weight. I am small weighing about 120 lbs. So I ate lots of carbs and protein and cut back on fruits and veggies. So during treatment I didn't eat as healthy as I should have. I finished treatment in August and I've slowly added more fruits and veggies. Do I eat a balanced diet every day? No, but I'm trying to eat better. I just hope I didn't mess everything up by not eating many fruits and veggies during treatment and the first several months after. I tried to eat more of those things right after treatment but it gave me a constant rumbly tummy, gas, and upset stomach. C Diff messes with your mind, or it did mine. Every time I get an upset stomach I think oh no it's C Diff! It's crazy. But the less fiber I eat the better my stomach seems to do but still, I've got to get back on a better diet, but like I said will it really work? My Onc says everybody needs to eat well but nobody knows for sure if it will keep cancer from coming back. He's seen both ends of the spectrum meaning he has some patients that eat and exercise well that have recurrences and he has some that didn't change their lifestyle that are several years out from treatment with no recurrences. So in my opinion we need to do everything we can to stay healthy, but it's a crapshoot. ",

Do you have any fever, nausea, loss of appetite? There's many things it could be. I've had this since Friday but it was worse on Friday. I thought about going to the ER but my PCP said she didn't think I needed to. I wish she would've at least did a blood test but she didn't. She said if the ultrasound didn't show anything then I may need a CT. I'm hoping for just a cyst! She said ultrasound was best for showing the female stuff but CT is better for colon.

I finished chemo just over two years ago. I was thrown into chemopause. I was dry for awhile then had off and on discharge. Mentioned it to Onc and he said it could mean my ovaries are \"waking up\". I had some light bleeding and discharge stuff for a few months off and on from last Sept to Dec., then nothing. Started having discharge again about 5-6 weeks ago but was mostly coming out when I used the bathroom. Last Thursday it looked brownish pink like at the beginning or end of a period. Yesterday and today I've had nothing. They tell me that since my BRCA test was negative and I'm Triple Neg that it wouldn't spread to the female parts. So I'm guessing the discharge/blood is just a wonky period or like perimenopause stuff. I'm hoping anyway. I'll keep an eye on this thread. Edit: I hope it's ok that I posted here even though I wasn't Stage III! I'm so sorry if I shouldn't have done so! Mods, if I wasn't supposed to do this, feel free to delete it.

I was 36 at diagnosis, 38 now. I was honestly shocked at the number of young ladies I met while in treatment. I met many in their 20's! It is not just an older person's disease. What I mean by older is women over 40. Like I said it sucks no matter what age you are. Hang in there and take one step at a time. We're here for you. Oh and I find this forum to be more active than the the young and strong survival forum, and you should get more responses to your posts over here. I'm not bashing the other one. This one is just more active. It feels like family!",

Only one positive node is a good sign from what I've read. You're still early stage and that's a good sign! These are routine tests. I only had a breast MRI, chest xray, heart ultrasound and the MUGA test. My Onc said other's weren't necessary due to my path report. I trust him but always question whether or not I should've requested more tests, especially since my cancer was triple negative. I can't go back in time so I just have to trust the docs and pray for the best. ",

If the experts knew what caused it then there would be a cure by now, according to the doctors. It it were food everyone would have it. If it were from not exercising enough fitness guru's wouldn't have it. If it were from alcohol a lot more folks would have it. Sure, we need to eat right, exercise, not overdo alcohol, etc to improve our overall health but it's not going to stop cancer, if it wants to invade our bodies. That's just how it goes. It's a tough pill to swallow and it sucks but all we can do is try to better our health and live each day. That goes for anyone. Nobody deserves this damn disease, but it happens.",
