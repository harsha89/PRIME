Diagnostic Mammogram: spot compression of the breast shows a persistant area of density nearly 1 cm in size in the inferior left breast. the patient was referred for sonography. Ultrasound: a 5 mm density a the 8 oclock position was identified with solid characteristic and posterior acoustical shadowing along with a poorly defined posterior wall. some tiny cysts wer detected as well. suspicious nodule at 8 oclock left breast. Biopsy is recommended BIRADS4 suspicious abnormality- biopsy should be considered. the doctor recommended a surgical biopsy and not a needle. they will call me today with the appointment with the breast surgeon. can anyone explain to me what all this means in english. thanks a bunch ladies with all the support terrie45",
