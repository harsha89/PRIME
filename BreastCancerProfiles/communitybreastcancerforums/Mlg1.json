They don't know if it is moved to other parts of the body. My ob-gyn said to wait about 1 week for the cancer surgeon to call me. I am extremely worried and why does it take soo long for the call back. She said the next process was for the surgeon to cut me open and see how cancer progressed and get the tumor out. Is this normal? I feel at some point I should get a second opinion. When? Thanks, Mlg Log in to post a reply",
