I am lactating and my breasts are very lumpy, one side is worse than the other. I do have a lump (I have posted a topic prior about to biopsy or not) that has been called to my attention greatly lately. Ultrasound and Mammogram were bi-rads2 benign with \"diffusely nodular parenchyma\" Lump showed up very lucent on mammogram which suggested to radiologist that it was a lipoma possibly but my final report didn't mention that- he just said so in the conference with him after films were taken. My lump does seem to change in my size, my husband thinks so as well. However, my breast tissue around the lump is also always changing size because I'm lactating. Thanks:)",

I just hate the wait. I really want this nightmare to be over with. I'm young, only 24 and I have 3 children ages 4, 3, and 4 months. They said during the ultrasound and mammogram that I have diffusely nodular parenchyma (I am also lactating). I do have several lumps in the same breast. They mentioned fibrocystic breast disease. My OB was comfortable with waiting until March and doing a re-evalulation. I am debating on whether I would just know now and get it over with. I'm very educated in the healthcare field, and I feel that we make the worst patients. I'm such a worry-wort! Read my earlier post, it describes the lump and everything. Yesterday it felt smaller than today.",

If you flick your finger on the edge of the lump it moves. Not sure how to tell the difference between dense breast tissue moving and whether a lump is mobile or not. Suggestions?
