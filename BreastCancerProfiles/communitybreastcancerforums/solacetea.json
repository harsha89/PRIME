He said he doesn't like to send people for chemo if it won't be beneficial, and if I would benefit from hormonal therapy only, that's what he'd prescribe. It's a holiday weekend and the results probably won't come until the week after next.  Honestly I don't care at all about my hair, if I have to have chemo to save my life, so be it. My hair has always been crappy (fine, thin, stick straight) so a change might be good, and I would never ever wear a wig.  It's hard to let go of the vanity, but if it's my life or my hair, the hair can go!",

My oncologist recommended it so I could start taking Aromasin instead of Tamoxifen, as my tumors were highly estrogen-receptor positive. I'm 50 and blood tests showed I had not gone into menopause. I had a hysterectomy 2 years ago for fibroids and heavy bleeding so I couldn't use that as an indicator of menopause. Anyway, I had the (minimally invasive laparoscopic) surgery on a Wednesday, laid around for four days, and went back to work on the following Monday. I had very little pain after the first day. I'm dealing with nighttime hot flashes but I was already having those for the past 10 years( perimenopause) and slightly more while on Tamoxifen. It was really not a big deal. Good luck, you'll be fine!",
