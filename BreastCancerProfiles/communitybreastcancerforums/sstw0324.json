My 2 brothers and 2 sisters-in-law and I are thinking that once she starts the chemo, that we should take shifts so that she is not alone - at least though the first cyle - to see how she reacts and can handle the chemo and any of its side effects.  Is this smart - overkill - or what?  She lives alone (our father died 26 years ago) and she's lived alone since that time and is fiercely independent - and we don't want to take that away from her, but don't want her to get sick from the chemo and be alone.....ideas, thoughts?????   I know everyone is different, but is there a day that's usually worse than others?  She'll be on a once a week regimine, 3 weeks on and 1 off for 4 rounds.  Thanks for any insight.

Thank you again.",

      "Content": "sstw0324 wrote: Hi, ladies.  My mother was diagnosed July 8th with a very rare form of breast cancer (poorly differentiated squamous carcinoma) which accounts for less than .1% of all breast cancers.  From everything I've read, especially in terms of such a rare cancer, getting a 2nd and/or 3rd opinion is smart.  So, my question is, has anyone ever heard of the Elliott & Elliott Breast Cancer Treatment & Research Center in Baton Rouge, LA?  I automatically thought of going to MD Anderson in Houston - but we live here in Baton Rouge so E&E would be so much easier - but I have never heard anything about this place and was wondering if anyone else has - and if so, what?
