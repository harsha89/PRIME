One day it was \" it's a different color\"(I wore a couple of different wigs and cut one short ) the next day another comment... well I was sick of them. Anyway one day he said to the other teller \"boy the next time I come in here shes going  to be bald.\")  Well that was it.  I looked at my co workers(they even ran in the other room to grab my manager as they knew what I was going to do. ) Then I grabbed my wig and pulled it off. And there I was in all my glory bald as a baby!!!! I'm here to tell you he was absolutly speechless!!!! He couldnt think of a darn thing to say and  my co workers, I about had to pick them up off the floor they were laughing so hard. So hang in there . Your hair will grow back soon enough.  My hair looks great now,and that member, he never says one Word about my hair anymore!!! and you know what? I'm serious, if I had to do all over again I would always go bald!!!!",

Yeah !but still have the rads to look forward to.Ugh!  But  I just keep my faith and my positive attitude and go with the flow. Remember we didnt ask for this disease it was just thrown into our lives and we just  have to take it one day at a time...Look at it this way you have come this far...you will befine...Lots of hugs Teresa...",
