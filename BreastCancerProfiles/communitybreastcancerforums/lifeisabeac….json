My gyn called it a mass. It is very deep. Feels like it is on the chest wall, if that makes sense. Are you willing to share where your doc found your lump / mass? My gyn, the surgeon she referred me to and the mammo place are all located at the same health care facility. I am going to call the surgeon's office tomorrow to make an appt and ask him where they recommend I get the mammo. I will ask if they have \"next day\" results. Thank you for that infomation!! My gyn ordered a screening mammo of both breasts, since I have not had one in many years. She also told me that since I have dense \"lumpy\" breasts, in my case, the mammo may not even find this lump. I guess I just need to take it step by step and ask a lot of questions along the way. I think I need to keep a notebook so I can write things down. This feeling of things being surreal is very uncomfortable...ugh ugh ugh :/  ",

My gyn told me that she has worked with this surgeon for decades. I looked up his info. His profile does not indicate he is a breast surgeon, per say. It shows of list of procedures that he does and breast biopsy is on the list. He is in his 70's. A highly seasoned doc, for sure. Per the rec of my gyn, I will start with him. She was very clear that he was the right person to help me. Thanks for your advice and information. I just joined this group late last night and already getting feedback is a really good feeling! life  ",

I am 59 years old with a strong family history of breast cancer, but this is the first time a doc has ever found a \"mass\". She recommended a surgeon. I went to see him and after a 2 minute (at most) clinical exam of the left breast, he said I don't have a mass. He said it is \"lumpy breasts\" and my gyn is being \"cautious\". My gyn ordered a screening mammo of both breasts. She told me most mammos are up to 40% inaccurate and they almost never find a \"deep mass.\" When I saw the surgeon, I brought the script from the gyn for a screening mammo. He I needed a diagnostic mammo and an ultrasound of the left breast. Both are scheduled for Oct 19. Such mixed messages and conflicting info...I have gone from fear and denial to feeling angry! I will get the diag mammo and US and go from there. I also have bilateral greenish colored nipple discharge. The surgeon is acting like it is a possible serious condition. After reading up on it, it does not meet the criteria for a pathological nipple discharge. This makes me feel even more leary. What do I do.....start over with new docs? This is already a CF and it has only just begun. They are not giving me peace of mind, they giving me more grief! Any suggestions?",

Too unorganized, conflicting information, etc. The surgeon told me he is a breast surgeon. However, his online profiles indicate he is General Surgeon. I guess he is \"self-designating\" himself as such, since he told me he does a lot of breast biopsies? Again, he had poor conversation skills and more or less wanted me to just defer to him and his recommendations. Another ugh and heavy sigh............",

If you know someone who has been touched by breast cancer, you know the importance of regular breast screenings. St. Mary Mercy offers MammoPlus® - a digital mammography screening PLUS a lifetime risk assessment for breast cancer. With MammoPlus®, we're able to determine if you are at higher risk for breast cancer, as well as monitor your breast health more accurately. Our mission is to keep you healthy, but we also know if there is a chance of breast cancer, the sooner it is discovered, the better chance of beating it. Benefits of MammoPlus®: St. Mary Mercy Livonia uses digital breast tomosynthesis, also known as 3D mammography. Tomosynthesis is a revolutionary new screening and diagnostic breast imaging tool used to improve the early detection of breast cancer. During the 3D part of the exam, an x-ray arm sweeps over the breast, taking multiple images in seconds. Images are displayed as a series of thin slices that can be viewed by our radiologists as individual images or in a dynamic interactive animation. Studies have shown 3D mammography to have better breast cancer detection rates than conventional 2D mammography. Tomosynthesis has also been proven to reduce the number of call-backs for further imaging.",

The mammo script says bilateral MammoPlus Diagnostic. Not sure if 2D or 3D. There is a hand written note by surgeon that says \"Palpable? Left breast\" Another ugh When the gyn referred me to the surgeon, she gave me a script with a handwritten picture of the location of the mass she felt and wrote a note saying \"Lt Breast deep non-tender mass\". I will bring this with me to the mammo on Thurs. I also called the last place I had a mammo and asked them to mail the CD to the facility I am going to on Thurs. The facility I am going to on Thurs originally said they would not do the mammo without the CD from my priors. I told them it had been MANY years. I called them today to let them know I asked the former clinic to mail the CD's - and hopefully they will receive by Thurs. Sorry for all the details....but as they say, that is where the devil is.....another ugh and *heavy sign*. I will post update after I get the results. Thanks again for your feedback.
