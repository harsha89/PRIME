My question is has anyone been told this when they had an ultrasound and if so what were the results of the biopsy? So What percentage of solid mass with acoustic shadowing are benign and what percentage are malignent? Thanks for all your help. This is a really great support site. I have read so much and learned so much from this site. My prayers are with everyone! Log in to post a reply",
