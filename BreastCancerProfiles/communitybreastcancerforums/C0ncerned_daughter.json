Her level of Ca 27-29 is 2102. I'm trying so hard to understand what this means. Please help me understand. I understand that it can be an unreliable test, but what does it mean when the level is in thousands range? Does that affect prognosis? thank you for your time and honesty. Log in to post a reply",
