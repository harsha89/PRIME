This is a wonderfully supportive community with tons of good information.  I haven't seen anyone with my particular problem though, so I'm hoping some of you will have some input for me. About 2.5 years ago I began to have significant swelling of my right breast with a large palpable lump behind the nipple.  I was sent for a dx mammogram, which showed nothing. Four months later I went back to my doctor because it was getting worse instead of better, and was sent to a general surgeon.  The surgeon diagnosed a large intraductal cyst by ultrasound, and scheduled me for an excisional biopsy. The biopsy was 4/29/2011 when I was 35 yrs old, and they removed an intraductal papilloma.  Biopsy was benign (thankfully!) and showed gynecomastia-like duct hyperplasia and PASH.  After the stitches where removed, the incision wouldn't stay closed and I was constantly leaking fluid.  My surgeon went back in to \"clean it up\"in September of 2011 and told me that a little bit of the orginal tissue had been left behind, but he took it out and debrided the area and installed a drain.  A week after the drain was removed, the full length of the incision had opened up again.  I was told at that point that it might take a few months to heal. It did heal partially, but never completely closed up. Monthly hormonal swelling would sometimes force the incision back open, and after 4 months of having a hole in by breast, I went back to my doctor.  He referred my to a breast specialist, who said it was time for my 6 month follow up mammogram anyway.  The hole was small at that point, and the mammogram was normal, so we didn't do anything at that point. By April of 2012, I had had a leaking hole in my breast for a year, and went back to the breast specialist.  She did an icision and debridement on May 3rd, and when that incision completely opened back up, she did another on May 29th.  She used 8 nylon stitches that time, and at 10 days I asked that only 3 be removed because I was afraid if they were all taken out it would just open up again.  Ten days after that, they removed the rest of the stitches. A month later, I ended up in the ER with a seroma that the ER doc wouldn't drain, that burst a day later. Relief from pain, hooray! And another big leaking incision. Two weeks after that, a painful infection. At follow up with my breast specialist in June of 2011, she told me that I was just having trouble healing and that hormonal swelling was complicating the process.   She put me on some vitimins and supplements to promote healing and subdue hormonal fluctuations, and gave me something called Silverlon to pack the wound with. It's a silver infused fabric that you wet with tap water and press into the incision site to keep the area sterile dry.  I used the silverlon for June, July and part of August, and by September the incision had finally, FINALLY closed for good. I thought. I had terrible nipple area pain at the surgical site with my most recent period on January 21st.  When I woke up the morning of January 26th, my scar had opened up again and was oozing yellowish-green discharge. Not a lot, no foul smell and no signs of infection.  Just another hole in my breast, again. It's about pencil eraser sized this time. My breast specialist can't see me until February 13th.  I know that my biopsy was benign, and I am thankful for that. But I am going crazy trying to figure out what could possibly be wrong with me! And wondering where I should go from here. After 4 surgeries in a year, I'm not eager to go that route again. Should I press for an MRI this time? Does anybody have a situation anything like this? I am so frustrated! Log in to post a reply",

I am otherwise healthy so I have put off seeing my regular doctor to see if I am immuno-comprimised for some reason.  Can't think of why I would be, other than this constant breast problem I have no other problems.  Normal average weight, no underlying disease, regular periods and almost never sick! Though I did have a shingles bout after my second surgery, I think that was just because my system was low from back to back surgeries under general anesthesia. Justme- I was leery at first about using normal tap water with the Silverlon packing stuff, but my surgeon explained that silver has very strong antibiotic properties, which made the tap water safe.  I used it that way for two months and didn't develop any kind of infection, so as far as I know she was right. I hear what you guys are saying about seeing a wound care specialist. I had considered that too, until I finally got it closed for 4 months!  I think maybe the reason I had such a hard time keeping the incision closed is that I have really large breasts for my size--36DDD. I wear a minimizing bra 24/7, but there was still always the weight pulling on the incision. What really prompted me to post is just that I'm worried that the original biopsy missed something.  It doesn't seem right to me that almost 2 years later I have such swelling and pain behind the nipple.  According to my surgeon, it comes out the incision site instead of the nipple because it's the point of least resistance.  So my question is, why do I still have so much of SOMETHING that needs to get out so bad it bursts scar tissue??",
