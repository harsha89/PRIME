It makes me feel special and welcomed and supported. <3 1: You're new to the boards- but I noticed that your orginanal dx date is in 2001, so what prompted you to come join? (I did read you were cancer free for 12 yrs so am assuming mets this year) My cancer reoccurred just this month/the end of last month. Well, they saw it metastasized to my bones. I had a biopsy a few weeks ago in my hip and they couldn't get enough bone tissue but...Im not sure what that means. Maybe they cant find more cancer. I have it in my spine and hips. We wanted to find out if its new cancer or the old one. I started the hormone pill a couple days ago. So. I joined here to meet others who have had a recurrence of breast cancer. Me and my doctor don't understand why I gotta have it. They cant see that in a biopsy. 2: Whats one thing that we would NEVER guess about you in a million years? Well even though I am a wheelchair user, I love rock climbing. I started climbing rock walls when I was 59. I have also been parasailing and love that. I hope to go sky diving some time. 3: Where would be your ideal vacation/getaway spot and why?  A camp called Special Touch. I go every summer. It is a Christian camp for people with intellectual and physical disabilities. It is awesome. 4: You mention that you have CP, do you think that has helped you \"prepare\" for dealing with all this medical junk? I don't know but I know it made me stronger. My CP is a piece of cake because I was born like this. I feel like I had neglected my CP work (my daily exercises and physical therapy- wearing braces etc.) because of the cancer. My CP has been a part of me my whole life. But I feel on the other hand God wants me to bless somebody. Don't know who though. 5: You said you'd love a dog- what breed, why?  I would want a lab because I like big dogs. I grew up with labs in my family. We had three of the. But we did have poodles too, two of them. But I would take ANY dog now. My cousin (and guardian) doesn't think I could look after a dog cus of my CP. :( But everybody should have a dog! BONUS :I would love to add i think its awesome you mention God- a few scriptures that get me through life is Philippians 4:13 and Ephesians 6:11 WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE(S)? Philippians 4:13 is my favorite verse too. A friend even gave me a wall hanger with that verse on it. It encourages me. For those who don't know, that verse says \"I can do ALL THINGS through Christ who strengthens me.\" as humans we are weak but God is strong. He gives us his strength even when we have none. ",

If you f\\trust your doctor they will do the right thing. I know what its like to be afraid. I like to turn my frightened moments over to God. I truly know the fear you are coming from. When I was told a month ago that it came back I was in devestation. But I know who has a key for my life- is God. He also has a key for you. Trust hiom and liusten to your doctor. Praying for you.",

As a matter of fact...a little icecream sounds yummy right about now.  I just now tried that numbing spray. It seems so so. I thinbk it gives me heartburn. But my aide just called the Nurse and it turns out that you can drink the magic mouthwash even if you cannot gurgle it so I will get a prescription later in the day for that. I hope it will work.",

Because of my cerebral palsy I cannot swish mouth wash. I cannot keep my lips closed to keep mouth wash inside or make gargling with my throat. They told me to drink warm things, not too cold or too hot. I am craving icecream and I think I will try that. And I will try some puree food- like baby food.  Due to my CP I cant suck on hard candies either so I have been eating some green spearmint gummies that have been soothing a little bit. I bouy\\ught some icecream today to try. Ill let you know how that goes.  I wonder if I can use that spray numbing stuff people get when they have a cold. My aides could spray the back of my throat maybe?  Ive been blessed because I make good choices. I had a muffin soaked in coffee today and that was so good. I have diabetis but it is under control thankfully. I feel like I have to take care of one thing before I can take care of another, you know?  Thank you Cancer crusher",
