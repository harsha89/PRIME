My son just turned 13 on the 16th, a day I wasn't sure I would see. Today was my wonderful 3  month scans to see how treatment is working. Most of my cancer had gone except for part of the tumor in my breast and in my left hip. The hip seems to want to hang around, which is strange because my right hip was worse then my left. My last set of scans showed possible liver lesions, but I have had spots there for  years and years and when they compared my CT scan with the Pet scan they didn't think it was anything to worry about. I also pulled a groin musle when putting up Christmas decorations it healed and then I picked up a box at work and pulled it again. It didn't show anything on my last scan, but with it still being there and reading where someones groin pain was from the hip cancer bothers me somewhat. I know I have cancer in the hip, so I don't know why I'm a crying baby today. I'm thankful to here, so so thankful, but the cane is a pain in the bottom when your son wants you to run around.  I know whatever the doctor tells me will not change the fight in me, but you would think after two years I would be able to deal with the scans a little better. It's not like I'm not doing them every 3 months. This is why I didn't want to post anything because I believe in being up beat and positive, but today I'm truly struggling. I'm a Christian and truly believe God is in control and I thank him everyday for 2 blessed years. I just want to be here for a long time...I know all of you feel that way. I guess I was thinking if I wrote all this down I would feel better. Thank you for listening and for all of your many post(s) that have blessed me.  May God  Bless you all...I pray for all us!!

I feel better knowing I'm not the only one that stresses. Ilike the word Carla used Scanxiety. I will keep that in my vocabulary. All of  you inspire me. I think a part of my problem is I had a friend loose the fight last week. She was only 40  years old. I trust in the Lord, but struggle with this. I've taken so many drugs and it seems with the scans, well here lately, after the scans I get a new treatment. YECK. I won't find out my results until next week, but I'm praying for all of us.  I'm glad I posted, you have made me not feel alone tonight. Thank You all so much!!  Hugs and Prayers coming back to  you!",
