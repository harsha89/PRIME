Her pain was getting progressively worse as time went on, I found this to be a bit concerning and in June I took her to the emergency room to find out what was going on. After some x-rays were done a doctor told us he saw several spots on her ribs and it looked like it could be cancer. She was admitted that day. After many tests a her Oncologist told us he it looked like she had Multiple Myeloma and my world crashed. He couldnt confirm his diagnosis until her bone marrow biopsy was finished. After waiting for a week with our minds being consumed with CANCER, her doc told us no cancer cells were found in her marrow and he now thought she had Hyperparathyroidism which was causing her hypercalcemia and her lesions on her bones. With this news we got a second chance at life and we were elated!!!! Fast forward to today, a second opinion revealed Stage 4 BC, lytic lesions can only be caused by cancer, Hyperparathyroidism wasn't responsible for the damage happening inside her, and our second chance at life slipped away!!! My mom has been isolated on her couch since June because walking hurts her so much, she has spinal compression and is on opiates but the pain is still too much. She is getting radiation on her spine and she is taking Femora and also getting Aridia treatments, \"she's HER2 positive,\" I have watched my mom for the last 4 months live in misery not only from pain but from her confinement in her house on the couch, and the physical change to her body from her BC is drastic with her spinal compression!! I've done a lot of research to educate myself, this also helps me to prepare for what lies ahead in the future. I'm trying to be positive but I know one day that cancer will win this battle. My mom is 65 and we have a great support system with family stepping in the role of caregivers. I know that she's getting palliative care and treatment will only prolong life but will this treatment give her a chance to enjoy some sort of a normal life? Will she be able to take one last trip to Maui? Will her ability to walk with no pain or at least not as much pain be possible? How do I talk to her about her future as far as her wishes with hospice care, advanced directives ect? I hope this doesn't sound like I'm giving up on her and waiting for the worst, I just want her to be as happy and as comfortable as possible and not worry about her journey through this hell!!! I love her so much and it kills me to see her everyday going through this, I just want her to be at peace with her life, with me and my brother, with her legacy and to not be afraid anymore! I feel like I'm on a rollercoaster ride and as much as I try to get off I can't!! Will everything work itself out?? Any comments would be greatly appreciated, thanks!!!!! Log in to post a reply",
