She said she'd call me back the next day, if my doctor would give her consent to give me the results. If not, my doctor would call me. She said that we'd go over the report, discuss follow up options, etc. Well, I guess my doctor didn't consent to her giving me the results because his office called the next day to tell me that the tumor wasn't cancer, which is great, of course. However, they couldn't answer any of my questions about what type of tumor it was, what my follow up plan should be, etc. Sooo, I call the breast clinic today to get more information and the woman I spoke to told me that the radiology report probably wasn't written up yet, and I could call back next week. So if no one knows anything then why in the heck did the woman who called me that first night tell me we'd go over the report the next day and discuss follow up and such?? Don't get me wrong, I'm happy that it's not cancer but there's more information that I need and I can't seem to get any answers to my questions. Someone obviously knows something, but I can't seem to connect to the person who MIGHT be able to help me out. *sigh* I'm frustrated. Adding to that frustration is I was asleep when the lady first called me and I can't remember her name. If I could, this would probably be so much easier! In the meantime, I'm itching like crazy because I had a major skin reaction to the dermabond they used over the incision and half of my breast. I removed the stuff, but I still have a horrible rash everywhere it touched and the itching is driving me insane. So I guess I'm frustrated AND grumpy. Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "bsmothermon wrote: I don't know if anyone remembers me. I've had two previous biopsies. Both B9. New lump that my surgeon thought was fibrocystic changes in November. He refused to talk about mamogram or ultrasound. I have a new area of concern plus the same one from November and I called his office yesterday to tell them I was demanding a mamogram and/or ultrasound. Well the receptionist said they can't refer me. I have to go through my primary care physician. Funny how the surgeon never told me this when I talked to him. So I called my Primary care doctor and his office had me referred within an hour to the breast clinic I requested. I go Wed afternoon (weather willing) for a diagnostic mamogram. I can't believe they got me in so fast. I had prepared myself for a few weeks down the road I'd have an appointment. The lady said I'd have my results before I left the clinic unless the radiologist is doing a biopsy and then someone would call me in no more than 48 hours. I can't tell you how happy I am to finally be getting what I needed to begin with. (And a little scared at the same time!) Hopefully the surgeon is right and these new places aren't anything to worry about, but getting the mamogram is the right thing to do, IMO. Now for the question: If there is something to worry about and I need another biopsy, I don't think I want to go see my surgeon. First, I don't care for him right now and second, he's out of a Cincinnati hospital and I want to stick with the clinic/hospital in Dayton. Will the clinic be able to give me some names of surgeons in their area? Log in to post a reply",
