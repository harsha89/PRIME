Dr and sonogram tech couldnt get an image said it was dense breast tissue. Well it's painful and has grown significantly since. Went back for breast check in September and was able to express orange fluid. Was referred to surgeon for consult and took some fluid from expressed breast to lab found atypical cells. OBGYN says could be abcess from nursing 13 months ago. But waiting for consult on Thursday Oct 8 for info. Going on vacation for 3 weeks on Oct18 and concerned won't have answers before. Lump is large now, no fever, no redness, but I can still express orange fluid (puss?) and hurts, nipple has inverted and breast is sunken in on arm pit side.Some soreness in armpit too. Called surgeons office 3x for earlier appt but no availability. Any input would be greatly appreciatd! Dx 10/13/2015, IDC, Right, 6cm+, Stage IIIC, Grade 3, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
