I was diagnosed June 6, 2016 I've met with the surgeon, who advised me of my options lumpectomy with radiation therapy or a mastectomy. I finally made a choice of mastectomy yesterday after 2 weeks of trying to really grasp whatttttttt is really happening to me. I feel like a deer caught in the headlights. The surgical staff set me up with my Breast Care Coordinator ' I'm still CLUELESS of what's next!",
