I go for an ultra sound and mammo on Friday. I am a little nervous I want to know what this is and get it out of me. I had thyroid cancer over 30 yrs ago and my mother who is a healthy 80 yr old, had breast cancer 6 yrs ago. I believe in prayer to the only wise God and asking for His guidance, while I am on this path. The very best to you.",
