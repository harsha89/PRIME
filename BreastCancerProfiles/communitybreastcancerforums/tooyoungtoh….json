Lorr, I have to debunk your theory...I slept more than 8 hours a night with noooo problem until cancer came to town. I actually knew something was wrong before I was diagnosed because I started waking up at 3 am every nite...and that was unusual for me. I called it the witching hour..and then voila...cancer. I attribute my sleeping difficulties now to all the drugs they have pumped through my body for the last 5 years. Also I used to take Ativan (loraz...not even a whole pill) a few times a week as well to help me sleep, but the I noticed my memory was getting worse and I had ringing in my ears. I thought it was just the chemo but when I looked up Ativan side effects...both were listed. So I threw it away and the ringing stopped...now i occassionally throw in a benadryl..but sometimes that doesnt even help. Hopefully tonite will be another good one!",

This change in dosage and frequency has been so AWESOME for me. I still have crap days but wow what a diff. I actually have days where I feel almost normal and so far am stable.

I lost use of my hand for a while. I could not grip objects, could not raise my arm over my head and had a lot of numbness both on under side of arm and in fingertips. I was doing everything I could to try to recover and after about 4 weeks, I had my onc provide me a recommendation to see a physical therapist. It made all the difference. I just had one session with her and she gave me tips that worked. Best thing she did was tell me to put a few tennis balls in a sock and stand against a wall and work the balls up and down my back. Sounds crazy but almost immediately I saw improvement. Now that being said, I still have tingling all up my arm and some numbness too, but my grip came back and my arm is pretty normal otherwise. So you might want to see a physical therapist about the arm. Good luck in your recovery",

I love to travel and be out and about, but with these drug side affects and all my tumors, it has been impossible to keep that up. And yes that gets depressing. But I also realize that I have good and bad days. Woke up today tired as heck so just doing home stuff and that's about it. Tomorrow I will prolly bounce back and head out to enjoy some sun. It is hard for spouses and anyone who has not experienced this crap to really understand how we feel. Sometimes they get too involved and sometimes they def don't do enough! Part of this endurance journey we are undergoing I guess. Also these drugs def have effects such as making the tears roll so know that as well. Hope your week gets better! Will be thinking of you. ",

At first I suspected it was the bone mets getting worse (as did my onc), but guess what...once I went off the chemo, the pain went away. So I told my doc that I think the drugs cause so much swelling that everything is pushing on each other in my back and causing pain and he agreed. So your pain might not be from the mets but from swelling due to the chemo etc. I took aleve for my pain and also got some hydrocodone which helped when things were real bad. Hope you are doing better:) nothing worse than frigging back pain!",

Others appeared to be almost like a mosquito bite and grew from there. So not sure what meds you are on now but maybe the rash is a reaction to it?

It seems like for a lot of them, it was such a breeze (almost a blip) and now they are fine.  As you all know this disease is not only emotionally taxing but extremely physically debilitating as well. I really want people to know this. I am very open with people about my side effects from treatment. I don't care if they get grossed out.

I am at the 6 year mark of this crap and a few months ago I was about to tell my doc...I AM DONE! The current chemo that i am on is Gemzar and it's been my roughest one. I had so much pain and discomfort from this stuff. I think my doc knew I had reached my boiling point and he suggested changing the frequency of the dosage so that i only have to go once a month and it made a HUGE diff. Now the cancer is all still there...just slowed down a bit...but at least I have some good days. He also has given me time off in between chemos just so I get to feel semi normal and prep mentally for the next one when it comes. I am completely a person who believes in QOL vs just breathing. I don't have kids but I have a great hubby that I would hate to leave and I also lost my mom to cancer (she passed at 47) so I have always said I want to try to outlive her...cuz I know she would want me to. But that being said...I have prepared my family and my hubs that at some point I might say enough is enough and stop treatment because of how hard it is. Just wanted you to know that you aren't alone in feeling the way you do. My only thoughts would be to maybe give Navelbine a shot and see how you feel. I know it gets old, but maybe it will be the one to make a difference and/or be more tolerable for you.  Hugs buddy!",

I actually did some research on what would help me and MJ was the number one find. I live in Cali so it's legal and I went and got my card...umm within seconds when I showed them my medical info. Had to educate myself on this stuff because I honestly had only tried it in college. So I got a few types and a vaporizer and then tried it. Worked AMAZINGLY well for the nausea. Seriously went away in like minutes. Also helped distract from the pain. After getting the MJ card from a diff doc, I told my onc what I was doing and he was totally onboard (just as I knew he would be) he actually wrote me a permission slip to get it too even though I already had it from the other doc. So I am all for whatever helps at this point. I haven't had to use it much since my Gemzar dosage was lowered, but it is there if I need it.",

Every chemo I have now causes some sort of back pain for me...my guess is it's from swelling which causing everything to press on each other back there.

Anyway onc says I have a mass in my axilla that is getting close to my nerves so he wants to do Rads to get it under control. The lesser of 2 evils I guess. I tolerated Rads pretty well when I did it 4 years ago. It was stressful because I did the treatments daily before I went to work. That combined with the fact that the place I had it done was full of a bunch of unprofessional goofs made it nerve wracking, but besides the stress the only real side effect that bothered me was fatigue. Man radiation made me tired...but so did that clinical trial drug sooooooooooo I guess I will just be tired the rest of my life. Luckily I do love my bed and my Land's End Jersey sheets.

For me it's more about clearing my head than toning up:) And what do I do all day..I feel best when I go out and do stuff one day and then kinda rest at home the day after. So when at home, i surf the net, play games online, watch tv, read, and I am a cleaning freak so that keeps me busy too. I also have a neighbor who stays at home so I hang with her too.

And to top it all off, just a few weeks after I was done, the tumors started growing again. I told my doc, not to ever ask me to do that chemo again or any other for a while. I completely agree with you that QOL matters too. I am still have side effects from Ixempra. I still have a lot of problems with my feet and neuropathy. Sucks. I am now doing a herceptin clinical trial where there are side effects but nothing in comparison to Ixempra. How bout asking if your doc can give you a break from the stuff for a while...even a few months will help. Or how about a lower dosage. Ixempra is still pretty new and I know lowering my dosage helped a lot...although I still hated it. I feel for you...and had the same thoughts about quitting.

We all joke that we were lucky to get good brains! But all jokes aside, I looked at the incidence of cancer near the base we spent most of our time at and the percentages were high. And during the 70s they did not regulate the bases and toxicity like they do now. We also used to travel abroad twice year on cargo planes which emitted a lot of radiation.
