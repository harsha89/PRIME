      "Content": "super wrote: My future mother-in-law was diagnosed with Stage 2a breast cancer. She underwent modified radical mastectomy for the left breast with lymph node dissection. The tumor is an invasive ductal carcinoma just a little over 2 cm in diameter. There were no lymph node metastasis or any other metastasis. The surgeon, who i agree with, says that she doesnt need chemotherapy. I was inside the Operating room when she had her mastectomy and the lymph nodes really were so small that it was hard to locate. Are there any specialists out there who can give an opinion? Most oncologists would recommend chemo but since it is a ductal carcinoma and with the affected breast remove, i really dont want to have her go through chemo after the surgical ordeal. Thanks in advance for the opinions!  Log in to post a reply",
