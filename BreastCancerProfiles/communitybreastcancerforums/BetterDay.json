Just chiming in here to wish you all smooth sailing through this process. As others have said, chemo certainly is no fun, but it is doable. Before you know it, you will be sending well-wishes to others that will be starting chemo long after you have finished. I look forward to the day when this website no longer is necessary, but in the meantime, it is an invaluable resource of information and support. Best of luck to you all.",
