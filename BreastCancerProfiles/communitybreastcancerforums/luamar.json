    "Content": "luamar wrote: I was diagnosed with ILC in 2009. I had double mastectomy and now I am still trying reconstruction. I had 4 attempts but all went wrong and without a fully explanation, I was sent home. I made a complaint and I am still waiting to hear from them. My story was broadcasted by the local BBC News. They want to make my story National News, if I find more women in the same situation. If you are not happy and want to support me, please see the video/share it   www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wMbkq...  and contact me. Thank you.
