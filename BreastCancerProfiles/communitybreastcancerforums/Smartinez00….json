I've been using Aloe with Vitamin E. That's the only thing my Dr. has recommended for now. It comes in a little capsule and you break open and apply. I wanted to add that I had a scare last week while I was applying my aloe I felt a little breast lump. I'm thinking how in the world could I have this after Masectomy and I still have expanders in place. I got right in to see my BS and she recommended an ultrasound right away. Thank goodness it was only scare tissue but of coarse I was freaking out for two days. Back on track and ready to finish this radiation. Good luck to you Mary and good luck to all my buddies here going through rads with me. Love and blessings too all!",

I thought it would be fun to join this group to get help or help someone else get through this radiation phase. I had my simulation today and my first tattoos ever. Lol Kind of made me a little emotional. I start Dec. 1st and I am a little behind schedule due to my arm movement range after surgery. Physical Therapy helped a little but it was still a struggle to keep my arm up that high and long today but glad it's over. I'm taking notes on creams and tips and thank each of you so much. If we've come this far we can certainly do RADS. Wishing you all a Happy Thanksgiving.",
