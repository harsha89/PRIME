I'm increasing my fluids to flush out the chemo and dead cancer cells, and have found a few foods that really feel good in my stomach ie soup, crackers, applesauce, ice water. I don't feel like doing much , which I hate, but resting alot and chatting with friends online, watching a few movies etc. I'm hoping someone will join us and tell us this goes away soon.

Regarding the lymphedema..my hand started swelling a week or so BEFORE rads..and my surgery was back in November so can't blame the rads I guess. Regarding holding the breath...I was supposed to practise holding for a minute but couldn't make it past 30 seconds so was told not to worry about it and don't do that for treatments. I do have a mold they made for my arms but of course it was done in the CT scan room and now that I am in the rads room the rads machine is right against it. The mold really doesn't fit comfortably. As an added challenge my legs are still very weak from the taxotere ( 5 weeks ago) and I use a cane for short distances but need a wheelchair to get through the hospital to the rads department. This all makes the experience more of challenge but so far I'll still take this over chemo any day.",

I am wondering though, why doesn't the hair on my legs fall out? How unfair if it doesn't!",

This is just a suggestion but maybe there are others here too who are struggling with \"chemo fog brain\". Would it be helpful if everyone started each post with Chemo start date and which round of chemo they are at and which day of the round they are at as well as which treatment? I am : FEC-D, Start date: Jan 28/2011 Cycle 1/6, Day 14 I have been trying to follow along with each of you to keep track of how you are all doing and where you are at but I confess my concentration is so poor I have become lost. But maybe it's just me. Heartburn: I had heartburn from hell and constant burning belching by day 4 and the doctor order rabeprazole and the relief has been marvelous. Mouth sores: I sipped ice water through my chemo RX and haven't had mouth sores yet, just very sensitive mouth. I was told to brush 4 times a day ( no flossing) and rinse with salt water 4 times a day. Also I always have a drink to sip  by me and suck hard candy so my mouth never becomes dry. I also use biotene. A few morning I have woke up with a burning tongue which was relieved as soon as I got fluids into me. I have had a mildly sore throat occasionally first thing in the am too which went away after fluids.",

The doctor who looked at it yesterday in emerg said the gum was reddened around the tooth, however the pain continued in waves...got really bad so I was clutching my face and couldn't talk for about 5 minutes and then went away. This happened numerous times. Then the pain started in the roof of my mouth. It too came in waves, so painful that again I could only hold my face and close my eyes and get through the wave of pain. That happened several times and I tried coating my mouth with milk of mag to try to ease the pain. ( read that somewhere). I can detect no specific sore spots. This is the most bizarre thing I have even gone through. I presume this is mucosititis. Today so far no pain but ready to run to the drug store for whatever I can find if it starts again.

Belching like crazyfrom upset stomach. I wanted to share my story about scans and mets. I was told I had bone mets in December as a radiologist was 98% sure that's what he saw on the CT scan. I was then put on Tamoxifen but as I had always had back problems I asked for second opinions and was sent for a MRI. Those results said mets in different places than the CT scan and none where the original radiologist saw them. I then had a bone biopsy. It was NEGATIVE for cancer. My advice to any of you is to push for second and even third opinions and have every test and scan you can if you are told you have bone mets. Ultimately a bone biopsy which does not hurt is what you want to have. I spent agonizing weeks trying to accept I was Stage 4 which is a very different prognosis as I am sure you are all aware. I now am back in Stage 3 and glad to be there. Really chemo fogged today so hope this makes sense... Tamoxifen was so much kinder than chemo but we do what we have to do right?",

That was so NOT reassuring. But 5 seconds of pain wasn't so bad.
