I have enlarged lymph nodes under each arm, more prominant in the left. I cen feel 2 or 3 ( like a cluster ) in the left. I also have a fibroadenoma in the left breast which continues to grow, and a large vein that covers the lump area and runs into the nipple. I have a follow-up appointment scheduled in 10 days as I went for my annual checkup 2 months ago and the doctor asked me to come back in 4 months as a precaution after the tests came back benign. But now that I have the nodes, the vein, and the pain in the arm I decided it was best not to wait, these have only developed in the last month. I find the pain does get worse during the day, my arm feels really heavy and weak as the day progresses.  I have my fingers crossed for you, hopefully we'll both get good results. Annie",

I had a mammogram, ultrasound, and a fine needle biopsy which came back with no abnormal cells. My doctor asked me to come back in 4 months unless there were further changes in the meantime. It was only after I had a look on the web about self examination that I realised after all these years I had never checked my armpits for nodes. So I did and that is when I found them. It has been about 4 weeks since then, I waited 2 weeks to see if they would go away and then I ummed and ahhed about what to do. I called my doctor and told the receptionist and she booked me into the first available. So here I am waiting and checking the area every single day. Paranoid much????? Lol. I hope for us that we have good news when we finally have our appointments.",

I would think that they would want a more complete ultrasound than the one you have. They need to explain where this pain is coming from and the reason behind it. It's so frustrating waiting for people to do their jobs properly, especially when it concerns your health. I have my appointment in 3 hours, I live in Australia, so the time difference is a bit confusing when I post on here. I get to come on here when everyone else is asleep. I'm nervous about today. I don't want them to find anything but I don't not want them to find anything. I'd hate to go there and be told all of this is nothing, but I don't want it to be something either. Aaaarrrggghhhh the confusion!!!!!!!!!! I'll let you know how it goes later. Thinking of you and hoping you get answers soon.",

She took a fine needle biopsy which came back with no abnormal cells and I was told it was a fibroadenoma. She has asked me to come back in 4 months to have the lump checked again and said if there were no changes we would most likely leave it. Now when poking around I can feel lymph nodes in my arm pit on the left side also. My questions are at my age is fibroadenoma likely? Should I be concerned about the lymph nodes and try to see my doctor before the next appointment? I am worried because I keep thinking if they didn't get enough cells for the needle bipopsy that something might be lurking underneath. Has anyone had similar symptoms? Thanks for any answers that come my way.  Dx 2/12/2014, DCIS/IDC/IDC: Tubular, Right, 2cm, Stage IA, Grade 1, 0/3 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- (DUAL) Log in to post a reply",

The lump has increased in size over this last 2 months, my left breast has increased in size, and a vein has developed over the breast next to the lump area and across the nipple. It is close to the surface and looks a bit like a varicose vein. At first I thought I must be imagining it but my husband has noticed it too. The lymph nodes can still be felt under my left arm pit and I now have aches and a feeling of weakness in that arm.  I called my breast doctor and she has brought my appointment closer to the 10th Feb, which will be 2 months and 1 week from the last appointment I had with her. I guess I'm just wondering if others have had the same kind of symptoms and if so what was their outcome. I know we won't know what's going on until I see the doctor but for me knowing information actually gives me less stress than wondering about the possibilities. Thanks again for any advice and giving e the opportunity to let it out. Annie ",

I'm going to watch the lymph nodes to see if they go down, if not then I'll make an earlier appointment to see the doctor. I think I'll also ask to have the larger lump removed, the stress of thinking about it is too much. Thanks again.",
