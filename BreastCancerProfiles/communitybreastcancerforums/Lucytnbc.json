One disease give you hyperthyroidism and one give hypothyroidism??? How do you manage? Chemo does some strange things to the body, huh? Sorry to hear your in pain with cold weather. As far as I'm concerned, living in MA is even worse than living in ME when it comes to dealing with the weather. I was born in MA, but moved to northern ME 12 years ago. MA cold has a damper cold - if that makes sense to you. It feels colder in the bones! I'll post again when I hear back from my primary with the results of the skeletal scan and blood work.",

I opted for triple doses of the Taxol during chemo. It's now been just over a year since completing the Taxol treatment and I still have severe bone pain in my legs every time the weather changes. I mean... I have a high pain tolerance (I pass kidney stones every 3-4 months without pain meds), but this bone pain is unbearable! It's not so much the pain level (maybe a 7 or 8, at its worst), but the non-stop pain when it hits. Anyone else dealing with this? Other problems I've been experiencing include bowel issues, joint pain, I've torn my meniscus from minor fall, lack of energy... Have any of you dealt with this stuff a year out? I'm so frustrated. Please tell me something helps with this bone pain and if it ends at some point. Thanks l Log in to post a reply",

I feel like I've aged 20 years in the past year and the doctors just don't seem to have any answers. Best of luck to you.",
