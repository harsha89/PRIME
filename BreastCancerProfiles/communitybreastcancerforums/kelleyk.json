So, I am here for support, encouragement and laughter (you girls are straight-shooters and I love it), information and normalcy...all of which I will take back to my mom.  She doesn't have a computer and has difficulty operating a cordless phone, quite honestly.  And that has nothing to do with cancer.  So, thank you for having me.  You all are amazing and this forum has helped me so much already.  Sincerely, KelleyK I'm 41 and had preventive bilateral mx 14 years ago b/c of family hx;  no recon. Mom has stage IV BC (LCIS) mets in liver, bones, possibly lungs (2-1-2010) Log in to post a reply",

But, I completely understand what you mean about your mom being a different person.  My mom has been different since her original diagnosis 15 years ago and now she's different again.  Cancer changes people in my experience and I think in my situation, my mother is protecting me.  Perhaps your mother is too.  They are mothers and that's what mothers do...protect their children, no matter the age.  I think my mom sees how much I have going on with my two girls and doesn't want to burden me with some things...I am seeing distance.  Perhaps that's what your mom is doing? And I think you are right about the random prognosis.  When I got the call about my mom, I felt a pain in my chest and immediately thought:  \"We don't have long with Mom.\"  But after reading post after post here, that's just not necessarily the case.  Many women live years and live well in Stage IV.  I hope you and your mom are ok and I'm glad you've found this site.  It's been an incredible help to me.  God bless you and your family.  Kelleyk",

She was rediagnosed with Stage IV recently so here we are again...wondering what we have.  But, I am trying to focus on each and every moment and savoring it.  My girls are 1 & 2 and although they are \"busy bees\" for my mom at this point, I am glad I see them with her and her with them.  Enjoy your daughter's wedding.  Dance your heart out and wear those pearls proudly.  I am sure they are beautiful and you will be too.  Try not to outshine the bride.  :) Kelleyk",
