I fought with my family doctors (plural, because I changed twice) for 3.5 years before one would send me to a specialist.  They kept sending me for tests (even the first specialist I saw).  The doctor doing the biopsy finally told me that I couldn't get any concrete results from the biopsy because I had too many cysts and nodules in the thyroid; the doctor doing the uptake test asked if I was afraid to be operated.  When I explained, he added to the test results that I should have it removed and STILL the doctor said 'goiter can't be cancerous'.  We argued; he looked at the results again and saw the other doctor's note; he said \"I guess I could send you to a specialist\" and I said \"Yeah, do that\".  Then to the first specialist for more of the same tests.  He was too afraid to operate because mine was a complicated surgery.  When I finally saw the SECOND specialist, he asked why my file had been dragging on so long and removed my thyroid within two weeks (Nov 2006). Two cancerous nodules, over 2 cm each. The largest nodules on each side were over 4 cm, but they thankfully were benign.  By the way, my bloodwork was always in 'the norm'. That being said, I had many cysts and nodules; you seem to have only one and so they should have a clear target for the biopsy.  Also, if it's any comfort, most thyroid cancers are very slow growing (i.e. over decades).  Good luck - here's hoping everything is benign!  Keep us posted! PS The thyroid cancer came first (Nov 2006); IBC was diagnosed Dec 2009.  Both primary cancers.  Both supposedly 'rare'. ",

It is usually one of the easiest cancers to treat and especially track.  Thyroid cells are the only cells in the body to pick up iodine, so they track it that way with regular scans after the thyroidectomy. You don't lose your hair, get nauseous, or anything like that.  I get scans every 6 months (except they were stopped when they found the IBC, as were my blood tests because chemo knocks everything out of whack).  To both of you, I can't say it enough, thyroid cancer is rare - only about 10% of nodules are cancerous.  If you're a control freak like me and feel better prepared with research, a good resource is www.thyca.org (the Thyroid Cancer Survivors' Association in the U.S.)  They have a medical advisory board and their info is very reliable.",
