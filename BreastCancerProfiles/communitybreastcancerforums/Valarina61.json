To be honest my first thought when the burning pain started was it felt similar to when I had my biopsies done. (My right breast never completely got numb). But when I researched it I couldn't find much. So I put that thought aside. I then researched other causes of breast pain and really found nothing that fit.I am just at my witts end from the worry and uncertainty. This pain is new and only in that area. However, the lump I have found doesn't hurt just the tissue around it. I haven't felt any enlarged lymph nodes but have had pain on and off on that side under my arm, in my elbow and around my collar bone. My gut tells me that it is something to do with one of the markers but I could very well be wrong because I don't yet know where it has moved to. I guess my jumping to conclusions is wishful thinking that that is all it is and then it could just be removed. Again, thank you for taking the time to research and respond.",

Generally healthy but suffer from GIRD (have had several esophageal dialations) and the occasional hernia. Over the years my breast implants had encapsulated to the point where it was painful just to hug people. I decided to have them replaced... so 5 years ago they were replaced with silicone submuscular. They are small and are placed high so that most of my natural tissue falls below. Very happy with them. I have had annual mammograms for about 10 years. Four years ago there was micro calicfications found in my right breast so sent for a biopsy. They did a repeat mammo at that time and found 3 more areas so I had 2 biopsies on each breasts. At each site they placed a clip. Everything was benign and have had no problems since. Six weeks ago I woke up with a searing pain in my right breast (outer lower quadrant). It came and went for the next week or so. I made an appointment with my N.P. She did a breast exam and said she felt a lump at 7 o'clock (same breast). I could not feel it. Sent for a mammogram at the end of that week. There, they did an exam prior to mammo. Examiner didn't feel that lump but felt 2 small hard areas just off of my areola (same breast). Had mammo... then they did an u/s. Didn't speak to radiologist but was told everything was fine and to follow up with doctor. Called N.P. for an appt. because still having pain and now breast in that area has become larger. She prescribed 10 days of antibiotics and would schedule an MRI. Waited 8 days and didn't hear anything. I did another BSE and found a hard pea sized (but elongated) lump between the 2 spots nurse had felt at time of mammo. Reported this to N.P.'s office when I called about MRI. Insurance refused to pay for MRI so asked did they want me to have biopsy with this new lump or what? They would call back... but didn't. So I called and made an appt with N.P. My appt was Wednesday. N.P. didn't realise that I had silicone so that is good cause insurance will pay for MRI since that's the case. N.P. did exam found the same lump I did and noticed my breast is getting even bigger. After exam I asked her if it was possible for a biopsy marker to migrate. Her response left me reeling!!! Yes, it is. One of yours has moved didn't anyone tell you? ARE YOU SERIOUS? Why wasn't I told and isn't it possible that this is what the problem is? \"Mmmmm... I don't think so. I don't know anyone who has experienced pain from a biopsy clip.\" She went to get my mammo and u/s report but of course they weren't in my file. When they find them they will fax them to me. Now I am waiting for MRI appt. Has anyone else had this problem? I haven't found much info on line. I would appreciate any feedback. Sorry this is so long but wanted to give as much information up front as I could.  Log in to post a reply",
