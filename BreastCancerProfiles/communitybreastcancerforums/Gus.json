It's Deb!\"  My husband and I were so lucky to have met Deb at Pinkstock 2007, and I treasure the time that I was able to spend with her that weekend.   John, Katie and Carol, I pray that your wonderful memories of Deb give you comfort and bring you peace in the days ahead.  She loved you all, and her face would light up whenever she spoke of you.  My heartfelt prayers are with you today.

I will never forget her wonderful sense of humor or her uncanny ability to know just the right thing to say to comfort me when I needed it most.  My life is richer because of her friendship. Rest in peace, dear friend.  Bugs and fishes. Sue ",
