Chewed ice chips and iced hands/feet during Taxitere Also cold capped (Dignicap) and plan to do this for the remaining 3 sessions as well. Minimal side effects thus far. Low-grade headache has been a constant. Tylenol takes the edge off. Intermittent stomach burning/pain\u2014improving a little every day. Taking probiotics and eating yogurt seems to help. Eating extra to gain back weight lost during fast. Metabolism seems to have sped up, so gaining weight is trickier than I expected. I had several sleepless nights after Neulesta, but last night slept over 6.5 hours, which was a big improvement. No other side effects yet. Hoping to be able to get through the rest of this lead-up period with minimal side effects and be able to back to close to full strength before infusions #2.",
