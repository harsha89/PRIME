That's frustrating about the other finding though. Glad they are on top of it! Most likely it's a cyst or some other benign finding.",

The pain is awful and keeping me awake at night and shoots into my armpit as well as constant stabbing burning stabbyness. Anyway, the doc I initially saw couldnt feel the lump but spent two seconds trying. The tech felt both the lump I felt and another pea sized lump nearby. I am 30 btw. The mammogram and ultrasound came back clear saying that my breasts are hetergenously dense and I got a BIRADS of 1 obviously. So what does it mean? They said come back when I'm 40 unless anything changes before then. I am left with more questions than answers. My pain is leaving me in tears, the lump hasn't gone anywhere, and I am confused.

I have gotten to know my little lump quite well. And I have to say that he does NOT improve with time. He is a pain and an unwanted guest. I think he took residence in there six months ago because that's when the pain began but I didn't find the bugger until last month. He's hard as flint. No matter what I do to get him to move, he just sits there. He was hoping to go unoticed because he is deep in my boob but nothing escapes me forever! All joking aside I can feel the fear and anxiety well up inside me sometimes. Hard, immovable, fixed against my chest wall, can feel one edge clearly but the rest of the lump blends in to the surrounding tissue/muscle, lump itself isn't painful but breast is, localized unilateral breast pain for six freakin months.... I mean, the list of symptoms runs through my head and I can't help but go there. I guess I am looking for kind words of support to help me through this wait. And any bit of reality I will gladly take thrown my way too. Crazy as it may sound, my big fear for my appointment next week is that imaging won't visualize it. I want to SEE what this lump is. I want a medical professional to see it. At least my ND felt it so I'm not imagining it. Log in to post a reply",

I am so discouraged and frustrated that I am still no nearer to figuring out what's wrong. My breast hurts worse everyday. I have a lump everyone can feel but no one can see. Could it be that it's just a lump of normal tissue all balled together and that's why it's invisible? I was hoping they would see that it was a fibroadenoma or SOMEthing to explain the pain. So here I sit, contemplating calling my doc and oushing for more testing or just trusting that this is my new normal.",
