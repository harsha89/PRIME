I am anxious to get going, but very nervous on the other hand. I had bilatteral mastectomys Feb. 25th with tissue expanders. I am filled to 400 and I think I am done expanding. I had a port placed yesterday, and am healing well from that. I am going to a chemo education class tomorrow and then start the big fight on Friday!!!! What a journey it has been already. I often can't believe it, but then other times it all comes crashing in. I am anxious to hear how you all are doing. Good luck.",

Then nausea premeds. I am not sure what I was given as I agreed to a nausea drug study. I know I had the Dex. which made me antsy. The treatment went very well. They had me chew on ice chip during the first drug to decrease mouth sore. I also have been rinsing 3 times a day with biotene. No problems so far. I felt great until about 3:00 and then had alot of trouble with nausea and vomitted once the rest of the day and night. I would definitly not eat tomato soup after chemo. I think the acid was tough on my belly. I feel much better today. I feel a little foggy and mild nausea. We have to definitly take one day at a time and celebrate small victories. I was so grateful to wake up this morning with the sun shining and feeling like I had crossed another hurdle. Good luck Monday Karen if you start. You will do great. You are right the waiting and anticipation are the hardest. Have a great weekend everyone. Amy",

I still feel a little foggy and slow at times, but no more nausea and much improvedÂ  energy. I didwake up day 2 with a flushed face, whcih was much improved from the lovely gray I had going the night prior. I am hoping to get some better anti-nausea drugs on board the next round. I am excited for a weekend of feeling good though. We can do this ladies. Take one day at a time!!! I did find that gingerale, ginger snaps and potatoes were helpful.",
