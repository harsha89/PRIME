She is clear through out the book that they are still learning more about breast cancer . many aspects are still in infancy stages- such as genetic testing.  I am glad that someone cares enough to take their time and energy to try and make sense of this . Even if we do not agree with her, we can not just dismiss all the good she has done.She has done much research- AND she continues to write updated versions, which include new studies and new info.I would be worried if she were still a surgeon and wonder how she could have the time to do evrything. I wish she or someone else had all the answers....They just don't................. Hopefully Dr Love or someone else will find all the answers soon. Happy",

How unfair and I can not imagine the helplessness you must have felt as well as anyone that was with you (loved ones)  I had masetctomy with flap reconstruction. SO I have breast pain and donor site pain. I was on a IV and they used Dilaudin. I had them use half of what was perscribed but they gave my dosage to me sooner than would have if I used full amount. This worked for me. Unfortunately, I can not remember what the dose was- I want to say 1 mg and I used .5. That was for three days- then I went to percocet-which I am still using as needed four weeks later.  I am glad you will discuss this with your BS. You may be experiencing some post traumatic stress symptoms. No surprise this woul dhit you a few weeks after the surgery. Now that things are settling down for me- I aklso am remembering some not so pleasant things when I was in hospital. Nothing like yours but I think when our minds are outof crisis mode- Is when it all can \"hit\"us.  ",

This way maybe the next surgery can get it right.  Good Luck to you :)",

I went straight for the biopsy  I was diagnosed and my Doctor said I NEEDED an MRI to check other breast. So I ate my words and I took 3 valium and 2 ativan- It was better and doable but I feel panic just thinking about it. My Doctor said I have until December for my next MRI . I asked for total sedation and they said that you need an anestesiologist there and so it was not possible. I need what you did.  I have heard this Versed can cause adverse effects.  I would love some \":twilight\" sedation.Where can I find a place that will do it this way? Happy",

I had one and it showed DCIS-then Doctor wanted me to try for another MRI to see if anything was happening in right breast. I got through it second time around with 6 valium and an ativan. YES someone must drive you. After two lumpectomies and unable to get clean margins- I went for bilateral mastectomy -one breast was prophylactic to never need yearly MRI's and tamoxifen. So the original MRI would have just helped him have a better idea where to do biopsy... so maybe you do not really need one.... Try not to worry because it may be for no reason. Many changes in the breast are Benign!!!!!  Good luck!",

I can not imagine having a 3 month old and enduring chemo! how scary! your family sounds really special  It is nice to hear your story and how life moves on after all this BC issues that fill our minds for so long. And now your story goes to reconstruction and then back to raising your children and spending time with your family.  Something about it is almost appealing to know how much every day must mean to all of us.  Not to get too mushy- but I know after this (and I did not endure chemo) I feel closer to God and much more grateful to all the Important things in life -like my family and children.  Anyway, I appreciate your inspiring story and also the BCO web page . and you are SO right - this is a decision between my and DH. Thanks for saying that.  Happy",
