Smallest dosage: .5 MG These days I split the pill in half, often,should I choose to take it. In no way do I feel like this prescription takes away my personality, or changes the basic parameters of who am I. It does take the chronic pain (physical, mental, spiritual) off of my immediate radar screen when something IRL goes all-additionally frustrating..... like my flight is cancelled at the last minute, and in that immediate moment of 'flooding' of feelings, pain, frustration..... I know that my litttle bit of pharmacy intervention will calm my ALARM status and allow me to think straight and come up with a Plan B -- rather than just start sobbing in the airport restroom. In any case, all I have to offer is that I believe that there are prescriptions that more efficiently allow you to hang on to that personality that we come to love here more by the moment. One other random experience......my onc gave me a script for Effexor immediately after my Jan BILAT surgery. I took one half of the first pill and was \"sicker\" that I have ever been in my life. My DH nearly took me to the ER. The effects of that flipping pill were still in my system for at least ten days. It was weeks before I felt like it was gone. So obviously the finding of the right/proper/helpful script is in itself a process, which requires energy and willingness and support and faith and trust and hope and belief and experimenting and attempts and finances and gumption and grit and ability and self-preservation and and and and andandandandandand and............ I support what ever decision you reach for yourself. I would encourage you to allow your therapist to exercise her/their insight, training, expertise and knowledge to support you to the most direct path to wellness possible, which might just include the pharmacy. LOTS of love in the midst of it all.......... xx00xx00xx00xx",

I had a lumpectomy, great margins, finished rads at the end of June that summer and have been on tamoxofin ever since. I went skipping merrily into my 'regular' mamo 12/08, only to have the woman reading the film notice a slight area of suspicion. Not organized. Only visible under the highest magnification and the most compression. Recommendation at that time: mamo 6 months later -- that was done 6/09. Area still visible at that time, but no further progression nor 'organization.' Recommendation: 6 month mamo follow up. That is scheduled for the end of this month. I really cried on the way home 12/08 from that mamo. Here I had done everything according to two opinions. #*()%(&@(# Then on the second day after that mamo I just took a deep breath and convinced myself that worry, anger etc didn't contribute anything positive. And with a snap of my fingers I was \"fine.\" I know that this sounds simplistic -- but I'm a pretty simple, straight forward person. I get really cranky when it's time to schedule the next mamo..... but once it's on my calendar I go back to bliss & emersing myself in my 'real' life.   My frustration comes from having to attempt to schedule my professional life around all of this unknown. I probably shed a few more tears than the average grandma when my grands do something amazing like sing or dance, but to this point I have been able to 'tolerate' nearly 12 months of gray cloud on the horizon. To this point they have felt that the area was so miniscule that it wouldn't even be possible to biopsy. Yes, they actually used the analogy of a needle in a haystack. My heart goes out to you, as my DCIS is certainly not the same ballpark as your experience and I certainly understand that. The similarity is in our time frames. Know that you are not alone. Know that your strength waits to be tapped into. Know that there are people here to support you -- whatever lies ahead. xx00xx00xx00xx",

Some evenings I'd cry, laugh, cry, and then cry..... other night's just the opposite. I remember him walking in one evening and saying, \"Oh, tonight's a crying evening.\" He said it without judgement or fright. It was an observation. He gave me a huge bear hug and that was that. I remember him saying things like, \"well go ahead and cry it ALL out.\" I'd go on laughing jags too... sometimes at the wackiest of moments. Everything was heightened. It's hard to articulate, but he did not 'say' the cliches -- but he acted them, professed them, believed them -- as in, everything will work out. He often said, \"we'll get thru this together.\" One of the most touching times was when he came home with tears in HIS eyes. I had repeatedly said that I needed to \"get my ducks in a row\" (make surgery choices, treatment choices etc etc.) I said it often enough that people started sending me ducks: duck cards, rubber ducks. Well on one evening, he came home and told me about traveling home thru a road construction zone..... and saw a mother duck and her 5 ducklings..... and they were in a row...... and they were crossing across five lanes of traffic and he was SO frightened for them..... but all of the five lanes of traffic, somehow stopped in time to let them waddle across. It was then that I realized just how much I loved him..... and how much his being strong had been helpful to me, but only the top coat of his feelings. I think it's brilliant to have an activity to throw yourself at: the fundraiser. Brilliant. Best wishes to the both of you...... urge her to come here.... but know that we're addictive. p.s. by the way, some would recommend not putting your personal info 'out' on the site...... you could delete your info above and just ask people to PM (private message) you to learn more",

      "Content": "Jun 12, 2011 09:40PM faithandfifty wrote: Elizabeth. It's hard to know what to say or how to say it. Nerves are on edge here in your bizarro world. You have been anchor for so many for so long and the waves toss about in your absence. I think long and hard before I continue to post. I don't belong here at Club Mets, other than as a cheerleader and a sender of prayers and encouragement. It would be the farthest thing from my heart if any words I contemplate and type brought any pain to any of your dear friends here. But I think I will take a risk, take a plunge and ramble on for a bit -- with the thought that perhaps you might have strength enough to read here periodically. Of course you know of my friendship with our dear Saint over the years. Believe me she taught me a lot. Lessons I still learn in her absence all these months later. Saint (Pat) made me promise that I wouldn't come to her funeral. She made me swear oaths of all hilarious lengths that I wouldn't come. She told me how she couldn't bare the thought of my sitting there without her. In fact, she made me promise not to come in that final week.... you know we went from talking on the phone daily for hours on end to suddenly she was done with the phone calls, incapable of them really and I had to learn to respect that. She always compared it to child-birth, about needing to draw on her own internal reserves and not wanting to be surround by a bunch of well-wishers messing up her rhythmn. We had one last phone call where there was some closure and I knew her time was at hand.... and then she left us permanently. KK, dearest KK. I hope & pray for a miracle beyond anyone's grasp of how or why -- Elizabeth, you, like Pat, are deserving of a whole new chapter, one to defy your physicians, one that can be the definition of \"HOPE\" for all when the chips are down. I wish you that chapter.   Pat used to call herself the infinite BoBo Doll. She'd say, \"Wow, I'm knocked flat again, but I'm not down yet.\" KK I know you've been knocked flat again... and I utterly hate that you've been flattened once more. KK, so many here see you as their own personal life-line. Understandably so. You've woven quite a legion of well-wishers in your sisterhood. For that reason alone I wish you a triumphant return to us that startles science. I knew that Pat truly meant for me not to 'suffer' in her final decline. I respected her wishes, for those promises, it was her wanting me to remember our nonsense, our silliness and her laughter and not the eventuality that took her. Making that promise to her was tough on me, but it wasn't about me in the end, it was my gift to show my respect that I honored. Elizabeth. Please know that I stand in your corner and wish you strength thru these tough days. KK Wouldn't it be amazing for you to rally and return here? I wish you those super-human capabilities. I also know that Pat, toward the end, told me when she was done. From that point on it just felt selfish on my part wishing her to hold on for one last tidbit -- to hold me up. Her suffering had been more than sufficient & I knew I just had to learn to live without her. I miss her like crazy. I miss her so horribly when we're up in our WI place -- since that's where we spent her last \"quality\" week together. I swear there are times when she stands over my shoulder and points something out to me yet its the wind & the joy of a treaured inside story that brings me back to reality. Elizabeth. I know everyone here wants whatever it is that you want for Elizabeth. The ache comes in the not knowing just exactly what it is that you want at any given time. Of course we want you whole and hilarious and leading the nonsense -- that goes without saying. We want chocolate and decadence and flitting references to pin-up men of the day. If I could click my heels that's what I'd wish for you. Know that I, too, send you peace. Know that we will have the biggest party ever imagined when we learn of your strength returning. Know, too, that we can give you the space to be fiercely independant as your sister describes. It's hard on me. I can only imagine how hard it is for your family members and others close at hand. Now I ramble. Thanks for letting me think through the emotions that come from knowing that none of this is in my control. My greatest hope is that you can be aware of the immense difference you have made around here -- to so many. That is how we measure your great kindness, in the affection felt by so many..... xx00xx00xx00xx00xx Strength and courage. Strength and courage. Strength and courage.",

It's bittersweet laughter. I always used to think that my arms were one of my best features. I have these cute little wrists and always thought that my arms were delicate. Now I look at women's arms with a wry and heavy heart. I did notice an elderly woman at church on Sunday and for a trim ol' gal her ankles looked like elephant ankles. I realized that whatever had caused her affliction had also seen her to old age and I exhaled. Grace-in-action. To be philosophical, sufficiently-zen-accepting enough, not to have this physical vessel mean so much would be one thing, but to have my aching arm impact my day-to-day is all together another. Living and being alive a gift to be sure. To continually be restricted by something so outta left field takes more insight than I have in the summer time. I do have a brilliant idea though and will get to documenting it and sharing shortly. Stay tuned. xx00xx00xx00xx The other thing, is that I remind myself that I'm a granny and that it all comes down to perspective and deplore that LE has raised it's ugliness for some of you young, spry babes.",

My threads here at BCO did not introduce me to your beloved Zoh, but this is such a wonderful and touching tribute. I want to support your concept in any way that I can by sharing my experience. We have learned how to 'self-publish' my work..... which is relatively 'easy.' We have my books printed in runs of 1000 to 1500 at a time. Like with all things, books are printed on an 'economy of scale' concept -- meaning, the more you print, the less they cost per book. My books are printed here in the US and I can certainly give those specifics if they are ever needed. There is also POD (print-on-demand) as a concept. Once the art is created, with the text organized into digital format, you can print as many as you want. Again the more that are printed at a time, the less per piece. If you want to start with 64 copies you start with 64 copies. When there's a need for two dozen more, you order two dozen more. This way you don't have to get concerned about warehousing and issues of that nature. My books are standard 32 page, hard bound, 9 by 12 inches in format. I have no experience with POD, but that might very well be the route to go to get started. Easier, quicker, faster, fewer to start with. I'm guessing that you could deviate from the 'standard' of 32 pages -- as per the specs of the company doing the printing. The getting them printed is the 'easy' part.... the 'marketing' is the long haul/tough stuff. I have a built-in audience in that I speak to teachers at conferences. Unfortunately there is a 'built-in' need and audience for a 'gift' of this sort. Would BCO get involved somehow? If there's anything that I can 'add' to the conversation from my perspective of self-published-ness, please let me know, ask me some specific questions. Respectfully, xx00xx00xx00xx00xx faithandfifty (Debbie Clement)",

I ask for a miracle that would leave all the doctors and all the treatments quaking with wonder & marveling at the possibilities of faith. But from your description, Little Bro, we acknowledge that we may long for that miracle and not grasp it's arrival. We stand beside you and surround you in this time. We hold hands & shake our heads over what we can not imagine. Heidi sparkled into our community with wit and humor -- lighting up the place with her smile and encouraging laughter. We were just learning to depend on her up-beat posts and attitude to cheer on those in need...... so it is such a shock to consider her treatment failing her. Heidi. when you are ready, please fly directly to the angels, knowing that you will be remembered here in this place. Know that in your brief time among us you truly made a difference. And for that I am grateful. We know that you will be a devoted guardian angel for your children, sending them sweet messages from just beyond their sight..... on the breeze of spring and in the fullness of summer's flowers. I pray that your time with them now be filled with honor & dignity -- sharing significant moments as long as possible. We wrap you in our hearts. We send you our love. Be at peace. Be at peace.

We will share your legacy. We will be made bold by your example. We will advocate for one another with more eloquence -- because we lost you in such short order.

As I returned to this world & it's quiet, serene darkness I was taken directly to thought of you, Heidi and to your dear family. Your family circle widens further as now we've met your dear sister-in-law and we think even more directly of your children and the family traditions that have punctuated the calendar with memories and emotions. Thank you sis for joining our circle..... and for taking the time to share with us. We are here for you. When I awoke this morning it was with a mind filled with new responsibilities for our Heidi-as-angel. I started to imagine the responsibilities that she might be given to brighten the lives of us earth-bound soujourners. The first thing that popped into my mind is that she might be put in charge of toddler eyelashes. I had a chance over the past couple days to marvel at toddler eyelashes & consider that must be an awesome heavely gig -- to help assign & maintain toddler eyelashes. It seemed Heidi like in  my waking mind. From there I let my imagination go. Perhaps she'd prefer to work on the absolute whirrr-buzz of the humingbird's flight as it passes over unsuspecting gardners shoulders at work? I know how she likes to bring smiles to the unsuspecting. Or the splash of the spring brook as it cascades down the hillside? Maybe she will join the angel band that plays together as the dawn breaks to announce the new day, birds singing and branches rustling? Snowflakes? Our unique Heidi could be put in charge of over-seeing snowflake design. Rainbows? Even more promising a concept. Knowing Heidi's resolve to offer support and encouragement and her ability to multi-task rearing her family and contributing to others -- she may just skip & flit back and forth till she settles in on a favorite or two. I can't wait to see this season's fall colors. I know with conviction it will be breath taking this year. Heidi will see to that. We continue our prayers for your entire circle of family members dear and for the actual community that surrounds Heidi geographically. Her circle of friends must be aching with angst over how to contribute their support at this time. We send you prayers. It brings such comfort to read your post dear sister-in-law. You will be there for her children. We knew that. To read it from your own fingertips & heart offers such reassurance to our cyber community of breast friends, as that was Heidi's one concern. We offer our collective strength to you in that process. We offer you our hearts as well. May you feel peace in this day. xx00xx00xx00xx Strength and courage. Strength and courage.

You are beyond our petty little earthly concerns now. You are beyond cancer. I think that perhaps your soul is reflecting on this experience, particularly these last several months and putting the jigsaw together on what you have learned thru your sharing. There is great pride here in the example you have given us. Great joy in your jetstream of energy that you pumped into so many. I know in the future I'll be asking myself, What would Heidi do? What would Heidi say? The love here is tangable.

Clean margins with first surgery..... so all I had to do was the radiation. I worked throughout (and my work is pretty a-typical.) I got my hospital to allow me to set a different time daily -- as needed to accomodate my needs. Sometimes first thing, sometimes last appt, sometimes over lunch.

Today I was in Chicago for an event I used to present at annually. This was my first return since my initial dx 3 years ago. I can't tell you how many people came up to tell me that they had been praying for me. Then they inevitably asked me, so how ya doing??? Hmmmmm. Second dx of BC. Followed by infection. Followed by LE. I can't quite figure out if I should ask them to stop praying or pray twice as hard. This one gal just started crying. \"But, I've been praying for you.\" (Keep in mind this is a total stranger to me.) I now feel that I have 'failed' her..... if she has prayed for me, and I went and had a second dx, then all the rest -- and of course she has NO idea that LE is actually more 'painful' and ultimately more imparing than the BC ever was, in and of it's 'early-stage' self. And she keeps on, \"but I've been praying for you.\" I make a joke at my own expense & say, \"You know I've always been an over achiever.\" She laughs and it seems we can move on. Kinda, sorta. The one set of friends we went out with for dinner 6 weeks ago & I attempted to explain all of this to my gal-pal, to the very best of my understanding, ran into me over the weekend and she said, \"oh, so you're still wearing that stuff?\" I guess she 'missed' the part about the rest of my life. Then there was last night. Our hostess & I are chatting in her kitchen and I am being absolutely stalked by mosquitos. I'm swatting and ducking. She no doubt thinks I'm a loon. After this irrational tragi-comedy continues for twenty minutes, I attempt to explain that I need to be cautious with squeetos. No matter how I attempted to explain........ ah. Then today. 94 degrees. Hot AND humid. The morning segment is in an ol' style gym. The ol' style pre-air-conditioning style gym. I am inwardly cursing, while smiling ear-to-ear cheshire style hawking my gear..... wondering how long it will take me to 'un-do' the damage of this setting. Suzabella....... et. al. Those of you further in have my total admiration. Those of you closer to my meak timetable have my deepest respect. Can I have one more round of this sucks??? Intone: \"Other people feel this.\" xx00xx00xx00xx Edited, cuz ranting implys typos.",

I had the blessing of time & opportunity this past summer to take several hundred, perhaps thousand pictures of daisies. There were flowers in profusion, sometimes within professionally tended gardens and sometimes along the path or roadside growing wild. I photographed as many as I could find. Of course you don't know that I'm 'new' to photography..... I'm learning all the time. So I'd rush home after a bike ride and picture taking marathon and quickly download the day's daisy catch and learn some more about what works & what doesn't. I'm also quite a novice when it comes to 'technology' and it's opportunities. This singular daisy is my favorite of many favorites. It's trajectory toward the sun. It's explosion against the blue sky, those amazing petals..... the focus & exposure -- I stumbled into capturing that moment. Then I went searching for the quote that illuminated the joy of coming to know that one individual flower..... and this is what I was able to assemble.  You may have thought I was always capable of such -- but I know what a miracle it is to have 'created' this image. It is a tiny token of how I think about you, Heidi. You have loved this community and you have indeed been loved. We see that evidence unfurling, as more and more are drawn to leave their comments. You have indeed felt the sun from both sides, Heidi. What a marvelous legacy. What an amazing impact. May this day be filled with peace. Strength and courage. Strength and courage. Strength and courage. xx00xx00xx00xx00xx00xx I remember a very long time ago, a wise person once told me, \"Don't spin your wheels on the question: WHY? It's better to immerse yourself in the energy of the question: Now What?\" I don't know if we'll ever have the insight to answer the question 'why' as it relates to your story, Heidi...... but we can indeed collectively work on the question, \"now what\"? xx00xx00xx00xx00xx00xx",

Her peace is now visible from across the room. There is a sense of grace that permeates up from her pillow -- bouncing to the ceiling and smells of lillac fields and blueberries, sunrays and newly fallen rain. I sense the connection in Heidi to all things pure. Yes. Purity. That's the right word. Heidi is gradually being refined, right before our eyes, and all that remains is purity.

I have yet to have final confirmation that the edema in my arm is lymphodema. The jury is still out and there is an outside possibility that it may be temporary, but I'm having a rough time accepting my compression sleeve & gauntlet, none-the-less. Do any of you brilliant gals have a 'quick' response for the inquiries from others about the gear? I need to develop an upbeat, quick response -- one for use with children, one for use with adults. \"What's that?\" From my 4 year old grandson. Once I convince myself to wear the gauntlet to work with children daily, I'm sure there will be many questions. Binney has gently challenged me to become a capable role model & to wear the flesh wrap out into my work...... which I aspire to doing this week. I don't want to get bogged down with the kiddos on what it is, so if anyone has a snappy answer, assuring & truthful, I'd appreciate your voice of experience. ***The thing is I see different groups of children with each day's visit...... so this will be a continual curiousity -- not one that I can address once with a class & be done-with-it.

I think that's what I love most about our Creator..... we can rant, rage, question and agonize over such issues and not lose that continual love. I agree with those who've already chimed in -- we are the loving arms and it is thru our relationships here that we see the goodness of our God. I hope that you receive all sorts of support and understanding from brilliant minds. Fifteen years ago was the first 'train wreck' of my life. (A genuine soap opera of epic proportions.)  As I reflect back now on the many blessings I've received as a result of the end of that chapter of my life, I am truly amazed. Beyond my wildest dreams for possibilities. At the time I couldn't imagine how I could possible carry on. As I've begun to grapple with BC and the toll it's taken on me I hope and pray for new blessings. I've already seen the goodness adding up -- thru a new dedication to my wellness/fitness routine, thru dozens of new survivor relationships, thru the keen support of my DH over the past 6 months. Know that you are not alone in this journey, (physical or spiritual.) Last winter we had the great good fortune to take a helicopter ride above the Grand Canyon. It was indeed awe-some. Having the opportunity to see that marvel, I knew all over again that we are in the hands of a loving and creative source. May you find support in your quest to wrestle with the tough stuff. My favorite bumper sticker: \"When you're going thru hell, keep going.\"  (attributed to Winston Churchill) For some quirky reason that little thought has given me much energy to \"hang-in-there\" thru some rough stuff. faithandfifty  ",

In any case, if it would happen to be frozen, you'll want to get with a PT just as soon as possible, because it literally gets 'more' frozen into place, without intervention. There's another thread on here, where those of us have spoken of these 'frozen' issues previously. I don't think that the thread has been active for a while......

My DH has hauled everything in from our car, but I am just capable enough to start putting the backdrop together on my own, while he moves the car to the back-lot. A woman I have known for the past 15 years (a vendor) comes walking directly toward me. I'm certain she will ask how I'm 'doing' since my BILAT in Jan.... as this is the first we've seen each other since my surgery, in fact this is our first interaction. I am already engrossed in thinking thru a gazillion details and upset about heading to a PT apointment, just as soon as this is all in place, so I'm a tad distracted. I am wearing a form-fitting t-shirt and layered over that is a loose fitting button-down jacket. She walks up. Pulls my jacket away from my body and the first words out of her mouth: \"So just how flat are ya?\" When my head stops revolving on my neck I must have said something about being busy, because she then left me to my set up.

My surgeon has not dx the swelling in my arm, and went as far as to say that it would be an 'impossibility' for me to contract LE..... consequently my PCP has referred me to a new BC surgeon. (He's fired.) I still await this new appointment. It is thru a different hospital all together. It will be interesting to see what a new pair of eyes (who did not perform the surgery) has to say about the matter. In the mean time, I can report that the arm that is currently attatched to my body does not feel like it is mine. Having known my previous right arm for over 53 years, I feel in the cat-bird's seat for saying this one is not mine. It is so utterly deplorable to read what is necessary from the patients in order that we educate the physicians who care for us. On the flip side, I am completely in awe of those of you who are amassing the findings of the studies that will bring light to this condition. I have thought all day about an analogy. None has presented itself.....  the closest that I can construct, would be for an expert to say that \"I didn't develop chronic depression following my BILAT surgery -- so therefore you shouldn't either. In fact I just want you to go away & be happy.\" At the very least we need to have BCO thouroughly review all LE info here. Period. Consider my name signed on the petition.

Just goes to show what a title & a labcoat can lead you to believe. I was totally duped. Now Sarah. I am a pretty civil person ordinarily. I read your post earlier this afternoon & decided that it was in my best interest & that of posterity NOT to respond upon reading it initially. Earlier this year there was one of your \"tempest-in-a-teapot\" reactions on the Stage IV thread here on this site, after earlier-stage individuals posted disrespectful inquiries to our sisters here facing their diagnosis. At the time those uninformed posts turned my stomach. Several suggested a positive attitude was what was lacking in the fight against Stage IV. The moderators had to intervene. In the end the entire forum was changed to invite only those w Stage IV and their supporters to post in that forum. Hmmmmmmmmmmm. Got me to thinking. If you haven't experienced LE maybe your qualifications for commenting on the attitude of those whose lives have been impacted should be taken into consideration...... and then perhaps your comment could be removed by the moderators. I wonder how you would have responded to those pushing for civil liberties a couple decades back. Were those folks cranky? If we can not get our fellow BC survivors to \"understand\" the impact of LE...... then I am truly at a loss as to how long it will take to get the general public to grasp the enormity of what is involved. This is me, holding my tongue and counting to one thousand several times. Me, with my BC sugeon who has told me that it is an impossibility for me to have LE. Me, being treated with PT, Kinesio taping and compression garments awaiting a dx.  Me, a month later waiting for my second opinion surgeon appointment still two weeks away. Me running from office to office to find someone both educated/informed & compassionate & informed. Tempest-in-a-teapot. I must tell you. I think that is THE singular most disrespectful term that I have read here. Granted I frequent 'happy' threads, but your post reflects your lack of understanding and your lack of empathy.",

Tonight we were running errands and traveling around our outter belt.... the interstate of a city.... and right there interrupting all of that asphalt was a glorious sunset: clouds of every hue in a water color wash too glorious for any artist here to paint. While I've been thinking of you through out the day, the sunset brought me to tears on your behalf. So many things I don't understand, so many inequities without meaning. And then there's the sunset prodding me to acknowledge pure beauty, both breath taking & amazing, even in the midst of what makes no sense. I personally believe that sunset is a reminder to trust.   This is an imperfect place, yet there is goodness everywhere. I've only been around BCO for 2.5 years, and only here on the boards for about a year and a half on a regular basis. Our community has lost many, many fine women in my brief time here. I want you to know that the messages written over these pages of your thread, for you & for all those who love you -- especially the collective messages written more recently, are immense for our community..... a quantem leap of articulated caring and an amazing \"reaching out\" by so many. I want you and your whole family to attempt to grasp how you have brought out the very best from this collective site. Since you are so new here and your family even 'newer' you may jump to the conclusion that we've collectively always been articulate and eloquant in our expressions of care. My observation is that your courage and your zippiest of personalities has helped us grow. I feel like we've grown up as a community -- in an effort to dig deeper and be 'better,' more responsive for you and your family. So we are indebted to you again. Thank you for showing us the way.

And from that picture I thought of this cyber-community of sisters linked all around the globe, and right now focused on you, Heidi, your family & friends. My thought this morning was about how very challenging it is for us to know what to \"write\" and leave here for all to read. I then realized the ENORMOUS amount of sisters & brothers who are reading here & as yet feel unable to leave a message. Undoubtedly not knowing what to say. I would like to extend a sincere invitation, a challenge of sorts to those in our BCO community who have been reading yet not yet posting. I awoke with the idea of everyone who reads just writing the simplest of messages to the family, so that they can see just how broad & vast our network of caring extends, how deep & wide our love for Heidi reaches. My thought was that you might just say, \"I am keeping watch. I am part of Heidi's vigil.\"  Perhaps this would give further strength to Heidi's family, her children and their circle of friends.... to see even more who are called to this task of standing watch -- of strengthening the circle.

Rennasus, your comment is so true. Across boundaries, across religions, across cultures we reach out here at BCO, because at some level we 'get it.' Very shortly after my own diagnosis of DCIS, I found myself across the restaurant table of a new widower of a beloved BCO 'queen' of the chatroom. We found ourselves on the road, across country in the very neighborhood of one who had just left her husband. We made arrangements to take him to dinner -- to share our great appreciation for his dear wife. I'll always remember his gratitude for being able to carry on the conversation about loving her, about her heroic journey, about her love of the personalities of BCO. That was ages ago, but it impressed upon me the great good that we can do for one another here. We can cheer, we can encourage, we can offer hope. CTG's husband was so glad to meet us -- total strangers -- to realize anew her legacy to a very special group of women. Then there was my unbelievable good fortune to come to know \"Saint\" of these chatroom & discussion boards. We treasure the friendships between our families. Barbe, your being present for Yan is another example of the goodness that is BCO.... the communal help that we receive and offer one another. Yes. May there always be one in our midst to 'sit' with the families of those we've said our earthly goodbyes to. Olga's legacy here is heartfelt and genuine. Yan, your loss is unthinkable. Barbe, your kindness is of a caliber we can all feel down deep. Thank you. May we always use our connectivity here for the benefit of others. May we learn how to reach out and be supportive. May we always treasure our opportunities to make a difference. May we all see the common denominator that brought us together as an opportunity to reach higher in the midst of the unthinkable -- that we might transcend the disease and have moments where we do indeed conquer the specifics and rise above. Yan. I send every good thought to you and your family as you navigate forward without your guiding captain. Now look for her north star, shining down for that guidance. xx00xx00xx Strength and courage. Strength and courage. Strength and courage. We are each capable of making a difference. When it truly can be counted, when it matters.",

Still thinking thru the approach with PreSchoolers in large groups. A very amazing thing happened today though. I was putting away some laundry and found in a forgotten pile that I own a pair of black & white striped arm warmers. I have no idea when I purchased them. I have never worn them. I meant to double-check w/my PT today for her approval. They are actually very loose, so I 'know' ahead of time that they will be ok with her, but I will double check tomorrow, before wearing them on Wed. (Binney: so much for being brave this week. Maybe next week? It may depend on how warm the room gets, as these are knit.) Again, thanks. xx00xx00xx00xx ",

Yan you worked so hard and so steadfast to keep hope alive for Olga & in so doing you showered this community with your everlasting hope. And now comes the process of letting go of that hope, all while letting go of Olga in our very midst.You brought her story to us & shared a perspective that is seldom seen here in it's complete expression: the havoc wrought upon the spouse, the lover, the friend, the fellow parent in the face of the unthinkable. You brought words to the journey of the care giver and that has been a gift to us, Yan. Your efforts have been both heroic & selfless. We ache for you. We cry with you. I add yet more thanks for your sharing of the vibrant photo of Olga above. We see her sparkle. We see her glimmer -- her delight and her commonality to us all. I invite you over the weeks ahead to share more images of your loved one. Should you find yourself sleepless or at loose ends -- come in and share more of Olga. We can only love her further in her other roles as mother & daughter. We are here for you into the moments and months ahead. Please know how grateful we are for your intimate look into this journey. Treasure the stories now -- as you say goodbye. I see her as beautiful and whole, all over again. Watching you always. xx00xx00xx00xx Strength and courage. Strength and courage.

My goals at the time were to most efficiently get back to my real life.  I had been dx in '07 and had a lumpectomy followed by rads. With my 2nd dx in Jan, I had been given \"lots\" of time to think thru the recon issue. I chose a BILAT to achieve symetry (leftie proffie) and chose no additional surgery/recon. Things went along smoothly initially, but then developed an infection/cellulitis which resulted in hematoma/seroma, frozen shoulder and early Lymphodema issues. I think it was the cumulative surgeries/rads that made me be at risk for the LE. In any case, thank goodness I had decided not to go with recon. I have been in PT for most of this year to resolve these various issues. Of course I miss my breasts. That goes without saying, BUT all that has been said already is true of my transition to being flat, with the choice to strap on some silhouette. I am fortunate to have a husband that stands behind my decision making. Being breast-less-free has not caused a moment's interruption to our life of intimacy. There's much to consider in the decision making process, but I am completely in acceptance of my decision. Best wishes to everyone making choices. xx00xx00xx00xx",

The range of emotions that you are feeling is quite normal..... especially in your case -- being male & so young. Give yourself the kindness you need to take each step in it's own time. There are many decisions to make & you will be empowered by each one. This site is fantastic. We welcome you and will be ready to extend our support as you progress thru the weeks ahead. Speak up. Ask your questions. Express your feelings. Start a notebook for all of your reports. Start a list of questions to ask your doctors..... the questions can strike you in the middle of the night -- and then your brain can go blank in their office. Several have suggested taking a tape recorder to appointments, to capture the conversation. Know that you are not alone in this journey. My blessings to you and your family as you begin this adventure. You will find strength as you require it. Use your diagnosis as a prism to consider what is indeed important in your life. Best wishes as you have your surgery & begin your road to wellness. Faithandfifty",

They have kind of a 'racer' back, but for $7.00 and a quality product from Danskin -- I can't argue. It has a shelf bra built in. I just insert my lovely \"fluffies\" and off I go. They had them in LOTS of colors. I now have them in bright blue, green, white, black, dark peach and even a striped one. I have worn these out for a walk at our metro park (in public) and also worn them as a layer below a blouse or jacket. Thanks for the Target head's up, Coonie. We have one less than a mile away, I'll go check these out. I don't have anything in the beige family yet. This could be a lovely addition.",

I am certain, knowing you as well as I do, (LOL) that you are editing big time for our collective benefit. All I have to offer is empathy and concern. Of course as everyone has already said, there's just barely been a minute, infantessimal (sp??) amount of time for your grief to have been sorted..... let alone the physical nonsense. Yes. We want it done now & move on. We're so very American, can-do, rahrah in that way. This is all about process, I gotta think. I'm all for finding pharma-col-ogical back-up -- whatever it takes. Git 'er done. Take some stuff if it will quiet your barking dogs. Get ya some good stuff while yer at it. No martrydom here. You're among friends. When I read the word \"precious\" in Binney's description of you, it literally brought tears to my eyes. Indeed, precious, be kind. Find yourself someone who will listen. If ya have to pay 'em to listen then so be it. Or maybe just squawk more around here so's folks know that this is one tough road.... or squawk here and rant and pay somebody with mad skills.   I've got bumper stickers, \"When you're going thu hell........ keep going.\" (Churchill) And another favorite, \"When all else fails.......... lower your standards.\" But perhaps the most critical to the LE journey, \"When there is absolutely nothing that is funny -- laugh on credit.\" Not all that zen -- but ya gotta get the demons under control: talk therapy, ranting, cowboy boots, narcotics, chocolate, serious sex, retail therapy, comedy channel, trashy novels or all of the above on an endless loop. My world is spinning wildly, too, and I feel like I've gone all MIA on the LE forum, which eats at me, just attempting to make some progress IRL and sacrifices must be made. But since I could have started a thread with this title, in this forum, I was drawn in. We must be good to our precious little selves. We're all we've got.... and that is indeed good enough, however freakish, flat, inflated, throbbing we are -- we are precious. I'll hum myself to sleep tonight with some lullabye/mantra that repeats the word precious. xx00xx00xx00xx Strength and courage. Strength and courage. Strength and courage.  ",

We ask for your mercy to shine upon Stephanie. We ask for your direction of her medical team -- that they would steer her body toward wellness as directly as possible. We ask as a community woven together on her behalf. Give her strength and courage in the face of this portion of her journey. Stephanie has always been a witness of your hand at work, always reminding this community that You-are-able. A direct miracle of healing would be perfectly expressed in Stephanie's return to wholeness -- she would be the perfect vessel for your powerful mercy to be demonstrated to a world of doubt and unbelief. Work amazingly thru this story unfolding now. Wrap Stephanie in your care. Hold us up as we await developments. Give us hope.",
