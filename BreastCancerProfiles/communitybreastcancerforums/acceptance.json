Then there are an incredible number of demands on us every day from students, parents, administrators, state standards, cleaning the classroom, correcting papers, designing innovative lesson plans, and the list goes on. It is a wonderful profession of giving but when the big \"C\" comes along it's incredibly difficult to continue to meet all those expectations. There's that part of teaching you can't give up either; teachers are givers and they love what they can do to help young people.     ***Retire or not to retire if you can? Difficult question.",
