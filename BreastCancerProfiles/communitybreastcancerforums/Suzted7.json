I also had a lump right on my chest wall and I'd rank the pain right on up the list under having my daughter natural and a really really bad toothache. I was NOT ready for that. They gave me a xanax before it. Did NOTHING. BUT.....just like having a baby.....the minute it was done...the pain was gone and there wasn't any after either....like hours later. No pain. Sorry....I just don't sugarcoat anymore....lol......Let us know how it goes!",
