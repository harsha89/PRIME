But, they were great about getting me a schedule that works well for me. Everybody was so nice. I had a male tech and a female \"student\". Not sure if they will be my regular team or not, but they did a great job of explaining everything that was going to happen and why. They did a mold with my face turned to the left, both hands above my head and a support under my knees. My hands were starting to get numb by the end, but the simulation takes a lot longer than the treatments will, so it'll be okay. The student then gave me a tour of the whole place, where to park, how to check in, where to change, etc. I felt very \"at home\" by the end. Good thing, it'll be my home away from home for the next 6-1/2 weeks. The nurse and the RO also went over what to get to prepare--soft bras (I already got 2) and aloe gel. I'm ready. Bring it on!",

I guess she didn't think the girl at the desk understood the urgency, so she said \"I need it on file RIGHT NOW how I want to die.\" So, as much as I am not looking forward to the RADS and for as long as this process seems to take from diagnosis to completion of treatment, I have to tell myself, at least I'm still here and can think ahead beyond this \"inconvenience\". I am one of the lucky ones who had things caught early and who does not carry any of the dreaded gene mutations. Today I am counting my blessings.

Not sure if it'll all be gone by the end, but I certainly won't miss my \"European\" look. Between the no-hair area and my ALND scar it's really dark, almost looking bruised. My RO was not in today, which is my usual day to see her, but I checked in with the nurse (sometimes I think they are more tuned in to how we feel anyway) and she seemed a little concerned. She just wants me to slather on the Auquaphor all weekend and see how it looks on Monday. Hopefully the greasy stuff will do the trick. zjrosenthal - I was actually pretty red at the end of the first week, and it seemed pretty warm to the touch. I had been using some \"all-natural\" wipes before I went for my treatments because I didn't want any deodarant or aloe residue on me. Turns out, they were probably making me more red than I should have been. Once I stopped using them, I actually got better. Hopefully you will feel better after the weekend break. Congrats to all those who finished this week! For the rest of us in the winter group, we're almost there! I see the light!!!",

Woohoo! Guess I won't be giving up that second job THIS year! I mentioned to the tech today that I had gotten the EOB and she just agreed how expensive things are. She did mention that the setup can be VERY expensive since it covers the whole planning process, the review by several different people, etc. I guess I'll see when I get their detailed bill exactly what cost so much. It is what it is. 15 regular treatments down, 13 regular to go, then 5 boosts. Saw the RO today and she said other than being redder than last week, my skin looks good and she doesn't think I'll peel. Not sure how she can tell that, but I sure hope she's right.

All I can say is, THANK GOD we have good insurance. When you look at just the bills form my two surgeries--$86,000 for the first and $15,000 for the second--how would ANYBODY be able to deal with that without insurance? I have never once asked how much something was going to cost me. I probably will when it comes down to deciding on the final reconstruction phase.

Just a few questions: 1) Did everybody wait to start Tamoxifen (or whatever other hormonal therapy you are on) until AFTER rads? Sounds like that is going to be my MO's plan (she said she'd talk to me about the hormonal treatment more when I see her on Monday). Do you know why that is? I mean, hey, if I'm going to be thrown into menopause, bring it on--why wait! 2) Anybody else have hematomas that needed to resolve before rads could start? I still have a few small external bruises but feel lots of hard area throughout (I did have oncoplastic reconstruction, so a lot of the tissue has been shifted around). I just don't know if it's hematoma or that's just what it's going to feel like for a while. How do you know when it's gone? 3) How did everybody do with working during rads? I have a full-time computer job from home, so that one's not a problem. But I also have a part-time clerical job outside of the house. I wouldn't say it's a \"desk job\" because I do a lot of running around there. Just hoping I can still do both throughout.

Not sure exactly what that means, but I guess they do them once a week to make sure the tattoos are still aligning things properly (tech explained that people gain/lose weight and they have to make sure beams are being directed at the right spot). It was only after I was all done that he told me when I heard the buzzing noise is when they were actually doing the treatment. Other time in between was for pictures I guess. Even with this \"longer\" appointment, I was out of there in about 20 minutes! In fact, I got there early and they were just waiting for me. So, lesson learned, I'll get there early every day and maybe get right in (and out)! I'll see the RO every Friday after my treatment. Not sure if I'm just getting paranoid, but my radiated side looks a little pinker already. Is that normal? Anybody else notice this right away? I'll definitely ask about it tomorrow if it still looks pink. I'm so happy that my techs are all so nice. They do everything possible to make me comfortable, keep me covered when they can, and tell me everything that they are doing and explain what is going to happen. The lead even went and sat with my husband in the waiting area after my treatment and talked to him while I was changing. Hubby was there to take a picture to mark 1 down/32 to go!

Bali Comfort Revolution Seamless Smart Size Bra (Style #3484) It's sized as XS-S-M-L-XL-XXL (although sizes seemed to run small, I ended up one one size larger than I normally would have). It is extremely comfortable, no underwire, no hardware on the straps and stays in place very well. I found it at JCPenney but online I see that Macy's also carries it, so 'm sure other department stores may too. I just started treatments yesterday, so I can't vouch for how it will feel if skin problems arise, but I think it'll do nicely. I haven't been able to go back to my underwire bras since surgery anyway, too uncomfortable. This is nice and soft but also gives decent support (and doesn't look like a \"granny\" bra!).",

As they said, it all \"looked as we expect it would look after surgery and radiation\". So that was a relief. Today I saw the plastic surgeon and came away a little discouraged. My tumor was on the inner quadrant of my right side. I opted for an oncoplastic reconstruction at the time to avoid having a big hollowed out area. They basically rearranged the rest of the breast tissue to fill in what was taken out. After the surgery I developed a large seroma and, honestly, it hasn't softened up much since. Not sure if radiation made it worse or not. It's basically a big area of dead fat. My options are 1) go back in, surgically remove the dead tissue, which will give me that hollowed out spot I was trying to avoid, then fill it 2-3 times with fat grafting (I told him, I've got plenty I can give him) over the next 6 months or so; or 2) wait another 4-6 months to see if it absorbs on its own and then do 1-2 fat grafting sessions to fix up the shape. Problem is, if I opt for #2, there's no guarantee it WILL reabsorb and if it doesn't, I'll have to do #1 anyway. Of course, I want this to be fixed yesterday! So sick of looking lopsided and feeling hard and uncomfortable. But if there's a chance I might be able to avoid another surgery....I just don't know what to do. It was a year ago this week that I got my biopsy results back and found out I had cancer. I don't want to have to deal with this for another year! So sick of it!",

As I posted a few weeks ago, I have a large area that is hard which is apparently fat necrosis (dead tissue) that will, hopefully, be absorbed on its own. I also sometimes can't sleep on my side because of the soreness near where the lymph nodes were removed. I guess it's all part of our new \"normal\".

I see a little improvement, but would like to be able to feel things when I'm shaving my armpit! Hopefully given time yours will feel normal again. We just want to be back to normal NOW! I had a drain put in at the second surgery but removed after 5 days as the output was minimal. Of course, I've felt that full, tight feeling again and he confirmed that now I have hematomas on the right side. Not sure if the tube clotted and didn't let it all drain or what. He says they will liquify and either be reabsorbed or he will aspirate them. I asked him if anything would help (massage, heat, etc.), he said just time. Anybody else deal with hematoma?
