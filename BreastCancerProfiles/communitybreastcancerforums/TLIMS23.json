I have the same apprehension about my local hospital that I'm going to. I love the oncologist and she treats mainly BC and has been in practice over 30 years. I feel that living in Phila I should take advantage of the centers like Penn but this hospital is more convenient. Such a tough decision to make.  Best of luck to you",
