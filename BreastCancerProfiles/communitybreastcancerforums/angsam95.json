My mass is about 7mm. I had dimpling on my breast. Mammogram was negative, found on ultrasound. I saw the surgeon today. He said that first, I need CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis to check for any other tumors. He recommended a mastectomy in that breast with reconstruction at the same time. He said he would do a sentinel node biopsy and if they show cancer, he will take the others. I will see the plastic surgeon this week. He said that due to my age, this could be aggressive. Because of that and also needing my nipple and areola removed, a mastectomy with reconstruction is the best choice. Then he said I would see the oncologist. He said I'd likely need chemo followed by hormone receptor meds. He didn't suggest removing both breasts. Does this all sound reasonable for this type and grade of cancer at my age?

Initially he recommended lumpectomy and radiation but when he examined me and realised that the lump was under the areola right next to the nipple, he said that he would have to remove the areola and the nipple to get clear margins. He said if I did a lumpectomy, the breast would cave in and wouldn't be able to be fixed cosmetically. That's why he changed his mind and recommended a mastectomy with reconstruction.",
