I\u2019m single, without kids or family. So my only support system is friends and co-workers. And while I truly consider some of them to be great people and I know they would want to be there for me, they would wind up making me even more stressed out! That\u2019s one of the things I am finding the most helpful about this site...we\u2019re all in the same spot, no judgment and no baggage. Once I have my results I\u2019ll make my decision about what I share and with who. But for now my local bartender (I kid you not, ive known him for more than a decade) is driving me to my appt and an ex co-worker who won\u2019t blab about anything to my current office is picking me up. But neither of them know much beyond I need a ride cause I have to take some meds... Hang in there and I\u2019ll hope you get results before the weekend",

Before getting sidetracked for the last couple of weeks, I had been actively trying to incorporate \u201cmindfulness\u201d into my life for a couple of months I\u2019m not religious or even particularly spiritual, but something about turning 50 made me want to examine my life a little bit. I had found a little book called something like 10 Minute Mindfulness and I thought, I\u2019ve always got 10 minutes to spare! The book had lots of pretty basic suggestions about just stopping during your day and taking time to notice things around you, and it was even divided up with specific ideas for morning, daytime and evening. One was about taking the first few minutes when you wake up to notice and appreciate your warm, comfy bed (welp...that one put me right back to sleep!). But there was one that I had liked, and it was about taking the time to really feel and appreciate the hot water and luxury of your morning shower. So I tried to do that and to be grateful that I was so privileged to have hot running water at the turn of a handle while so many people in Puerto Rico did not. This morning I finally got to take a shower after my biopsies...and when I first looked at my poor bruised body, it was scary. But then I got in the hot water and it felt so good, and I suddenly remembered that mindfulness exercise. So rather than worry about my test results or focus on my fear, I just felt grateful for the feel of the hot water. I can\u2019t say I was virtuous enough to feel grateful to be where I was, as compared to those elsewhere without water....but I managed to find a few minutes where I could let go of thinking about what has already happened and worrying about what is going to happen, and just be there in the moment, in the hot water. Here\u2019s hoping that each of you can find a moment or two when you can just \u201cbe\u201d.... there\u2019s plenty of time for all the other crap.",

I am still trying to deal with the overwhelming feelings that came up when I got my dx on Friday, so I understand that pit in your stomach. Second, I want to let you know that I feel your participation in our group is meaningful and helpful. Hearing about how your wife's health is impacting you reminds me that my testing, and now my diagnosis and treatment, involves more than just me. It touches others around me, and that is good to remember. I am also moved by the love and concern that you have for your wife and I think you two are going to make a strong team to deal with this situation together. Sometime tomorrow, please go read the \"get prepared\" post under the \"Just Diagnosed\" thread (it is right at the top). I found it very helpful in terms of providing good info, but also because it made me feel like there were some things that I could start to do and not feel so paralyzed. Also, insist on a copy of the biopsy / pathology report. Words will be going in and out of your brain at the start, and it is important that you have the report so that you can keep things straight. Call them from work and get them to email or fax a copy to you if you can. We're here for you and sending you strength and support.",

Crystal, woo hoo for you!!! It sucks that it took so many unpleasant steps to get to this excellent result. But b9 and watchful follow ups is a great prognosis. I hope you don\u2019t find yourself in the waiting room again any time soon.

But are you feeling better or still stressed out? We\u2019re here for you if you still need support. Welcome Kat - do you know if it\u2019s likely that you\u2019ll get results before the end of next week after your Tuesday biopsy? I had mine on a Tuesday and got results on Friday ...but it sounds like I was a little faster than some others. Make sure to ask your dr about timing. And if it looks like you\u2019ll have to wait through the weekend, come hang out here with us....we\u2019ve all had those weekends of waiting that stink. And I\u2019ll be sending you good luck for Tuesday. What kind of biopsy are you having? Pharmgirl - I\u2019ll be putting up \u201cno room at the inn\u201d signs in my over busy brain! What a great metaphor and visual image to keep bad thoughts away. Thank you! Bowser- I hope the biopsy went well yesterday. I have always been a whimp when it came to doctors and needles (other than the dentist, weird huh?), and pretty private when it came to my body, and my breasts in particular. And I am amazed at the amount of desensitizing that I\u2019m experiencing (for better or worse) though all these doctors and procedures. Yesterday I had to go to the dermatologist because what they originally thought might be Pagets cancer came back as just bad eczema. But the affected areas are right where they will be performing my surgery...so the surgeon said to try and get it cleared up so I have the best chance of clean scars and good healing. So, I go into this dermatologist\u2019s office and explain the situation and she says ok, let\u2019s take a look. Well, then she puts this big headset on, kind of looked like a scuba mask with headlights, and shoved her face right into my girls until her nose was literally almost touching my skin! And then she poked and lifted and looked around. Now, a month ago I would have felt like dying from embarrassment over this. Instead I found myself looking at the top of her head and noticing that her grey roots were showing and she needed to visit her hair stylist! Amazing how things can change! I\u2019ll be sending you and your wife strong thoughts for another weekend of waiting, and good juju for b9 results on the liver biopsy so that you can move forward with a clear plan.

Adding recovery from surgery on top of everything else would just be one more thing to handle....and your plate is pretty full already. but, if they change that decision, I am sure that you will have the fortitude as a team to handle it. I am repeatedly uplifted when I read your posts, and I can hear the drive and positivity and the fight in you. I am amazed that your wife wanted to go to the movies after her port placement! She has the same kind of grit and positive attitude that you do. Fantastic! I think that your first chemo day is Thursday? I\u2019m sure it will be scary because of all the \u201cfirsts\u201d / \u201cunknowns\u201d. I\u2019ll be sending you good thoughts on that day. Ok, I\u2019ve got to get ready for my appt. I\u2019ll be thinking of all of you. And if I missed anyone who has jumped into our thread, please speak up and say hi again! When I\u2019m working on a remote device it can be hard to go back pages to make sure that I didn\u2019t miss anyone",

I\u2019m just leaving my initial appointments at Sloan Kettering, and am feeling very confident that this is a better fit for me. They have some concerns about heart issues, so I am staying overnight in town and have more appointments tomorrow so they can clear me for surgery. If all is ok, I will have surgery on the 28th. And late on Monday I got b9 results for the Pagets! So now I am able to startmaking a plan to move forward. I missed being in touch with all of you, and I was certainly thinking about you! More coming soon once I have caught up. But a special shout out to Boweser, since I did see your recent post....all these tests and unknowns are so hard.

      "Content": "Jan 12, 2018 05:02AM DagnyT wrote: Hi everyone, Thanks for checking in on me and my progress after my second surgery. I have to say, this second experience was nothing like the first surgery unfortunately. They ran into complications on the re-excision site and basically had to take off my nipple completely and then try to put it back on with a \"free skin graft\". The surgeon said there was about a 5% chance of that happening, but we didn't really discuss the details because he thought it was unlikely. So now I am sitting without a lot of info and will need to wait until I see him next week to figure out if the skin graft seems to be taking and what this all means in terms of my treatment. My recovery has definitely been impacted, as I am experiencing an intense amount of pain on that side and have strict instructions that nothing can get wet for at least 10 days (so no showering after 48 hours like last time). The reduction on the l side hasn't been too painful, although definitely more uncomfortable than the lx was. So I'm trying to rest and give my poor body time to heal. I won't get my oncotype score for another couple of weeks. And I guess I need to meet with the MO to talk about hormone meds....since I was ER/PR+. But that hasn't been scheduled yet. And frankly, I think I am going to refuse to start those until after my radiation is done. I am finding it harder than I expected to take care of myself alone for this second round of surgery. I don't want to be struggling with side effects of more than one treatment regimen at a time. Sahicks - I am glad that you have finally gotten an experienced team to review your information and that they are concluding that you do not need further testing at this point! I can imagine how frustrating and worrying this whole process has been for you, all because of that initial radiologist seeing things that others are not seeing. I hope you can take a deep breath and relax now and feel that you have been proactive and gotten the right medical professionals to review your case. I think that there is some subjectivity in how radiologists can read films, BUT many more have said that they don\u2019t see anything concerning compared to the one that thought something was there. So take comfort in the numbers and do your 6 month follow up and keep us posted. But I think it sounds like a good result at the end of this long process for you. Nswrites- so important that you followed up, or you never would have known about the missing test paperwork! You know that something is going on, and hopefully it is all benign. But you will feel better once you\u2019ve been able to rule things out. Let us know when your galactogram is scheduled. We\u2019ll be pulling for you. Bowser- I\u2019m sending you both good wishes for this second round of chemo. And I\u2019m hoping that it isn\u2019t any worse than the first one. You are a great team and I can tell that you are doing everything possible to support your wife in this process. Take it from someone who is going it alone, that support is so wonderful and needed! It is the very best medicine. Pharmgirl - how is your car?? What a crappy thing to have to deal with in the middle of everything! I know you\u2019re back up for round two at the end of next week. I\u2019ll be adding you in my good wishes to Bowser that this next treatment is similar to the last one, so that it is manageable. Jdrgr- I think you had your follow up this week. Are you now officially cleared? I hope you are feeling totally recovered from your LX by now. I\u2019m thinking about all of you today. Sending you good wishes for a nice weekend. ",

Sorry to have been MIA, I have had a bad couple of days. I woke up Saturday to a 7am message from my Dr that some of my biopsy slides didn't arrive from Dana Farber and that they were going to need to cancel / reschedule my surgery. Of course, it was the Saturday of the Christmas weekend - so no one was working. I called every number I had for DF and MSK, and even got a really nice guy at FedEx to try and help me see if there were any packages incoming under my Dr's name...no luck anywhere. So, I am back in the waiting room - again. But this time with rougher consequences. I don't have any help available if my surgery isn't this week...I live 3+ hours away from where my surgery will be done, and they require me to come in the day before for pre-op procedures. That means someone has to spend 2 days with me down in NYC and be able to handle the 6+ hours of driving. The friend who is helping me is a schoolteacher. So she has this week off. But if things get pushed, she can't take two days off to help me... So please put out some good vibes for me to the at FedEx that the package gets found. Pharmgirl - I'll be thinking about you tomorrow and Friday. I'm glad that you are feeling a little better and hope that you get further confirmation that the PET results are nothing to be too concerned about. Bowser - so glad to hear that the side effects are not too bad for your wife. As Pharmgirl said, she sounds like a real trooper if she was able to go to the movies after her port placement...so it doesn't surprise me that she's handling things well. I hope you had a quiet holiday with family and lots of love. Jdrgr - you can do this! We're thinking of you today - let us know how things are once you're done and you feel up to getting on the computer. You're (hopefully) a couple of days ahead of me, so I'll be very interested to know how you're doing. I'm sending you good thoughts. Sahicks - because of the difficult location of one of my calcification areas, my Dr did discuss the possibility of a surgical biopsy with me. What I recall is that they know the area fairly precisely from the mammogram films. They would go in surgically, targeting that area, and take out samples. They are not trying to get \"everything\". Then things are pretty much the same as if you had the needle biopsy. The path report either shows B9, or shows something. If it showed something, then you'd move forward depending on what showed up. The biggest difference that I remember was that for the surgical biopsy I would have been asleep and would have had a couple of stitches (versus being awake and not having any stitches). Keep us in the loop. You have been waiting for a long time, so you deserve to know what's going on inside you. Iris - welcome. I hope you made it through the weekend ok. We'll be thinking about you on Friday....let us know what you hear. We'll be hoping for B9 results for you. Sounds like this will be an active / long week for a lot of us. So hang in there everybody!",

I have found the first tagged posting under the \"just diagnosed\" forum to have a lot of helpful tips on how to get organized and start taking an active role in our care. Take a look at it.

Mine is tomorrow, so we can compare notes. Cycling -- i'm sorry your results weren't b9, and I'm not familiar enough with what your report said to even know what to suggest. I hope you are reaching out on other threads to get support and information. When is your oncology apt scheduled? Breast intentions -- I totally understand the feeling of being rushed in this process. I'll hope that Friday brings good results for you. And if not, then I will be glad to share with you the \"next steps\" that I will have gone through this week. KimberlyD -- welcome and let us know how your appointment goes on Thursday. Busytoday - welcome to you also. I have seen a poster called DJMammo who has helped a lot of people understand the lingo in various reports. Do a search for him and maybe send him a note or a post?

First let me tell you that I\u2019m really glad we are sticking together even as some of us have moved from the biopsy / waiting stage and on into the treatment (and still more waiting) stage. I feel so much less alone knowing that you are all out here in various stages of this same journey with me! Sounds like the week after Christmas is going to be a busy one for a lot of us. After lots of testing and consultation yesterday, I got cleared for my initial surgery on the 28th. The dox insisted it be in two steps to keep my time under anesthesia limited. Since that was my surgeon\u2019s preference anyway, all good with that plan. Jdgr is having her surgery on the 29th and Pharma starts chemo on the 29th. Bowser, I am sure that will be a busy week for you guys too. So let\u2019s all start gathering those positive thoughts for the last week of the year! Jdrgr- I agree with others. Surgery will give you peace of mind. Since it is b9 I assume you won\u2019t have to do any lymph node testing. If that\u2019s the case, then other ladies have said that the surgery and the recovery are pretty quick. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll be hoping for for you. Moo moo- two weeks sounds outrageously long to me! I had my biopsies on a Tuesday and got full results (including ER/PR/HER2 info) on Friday. Others have reported that getting those hormone test results took longer, but the basic path report came more quickly. I guess all you can do is keep calling and complaining, and maybe make sure they know that you want initial results even if hormone results take longer. I am so sorry you have a long wait. Breast intentions- glad your results were b9 and February will be here before you know it for your surgery. But keep asking questions to get comfort about the other things that you\u2019re worried about. We\u2019re here for you. NSwrites- congrats for getting a lower BIRADS score (don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve read about anyone going backwards, so that\u2019s great news). For your other symptoms, maybe you can try to get a second opinion? I\u2019m living proof (for totally different reasons) that different docs listen to you differently and offer you different options and support. So if it is possible, think about talking to another dr. Miss- when are you expecting your results? I hear you about the bleeding...it took 3 days for my punch biopsy (different than the one you had) to stop bleeding. My core needle biopsies bled for about 2 days. But now a couple of weeks out I\u2019m no longer \u201cBloody Mary\u201d and all is ok with the multiple incision sites. Beachside, how did things go on Tuesday? Hope they keep their word and you were a VIP! When do you expect results? Pharmgirl- we\u2019ll be together during that last week of the month. Ending this stressful year and getting ready to go forward into the new one, which will also be stressful, but which we can be prepared for, so we can fight this crappy enemy. Bowser - when is the liver biopsy scheduled for and how long do they think that results will take? You guys sooooo deserve to be out of the \u201cwaiting room\u201d and fully into the stage of planning treatments. Nothing any of us can say will make this easy, for either of you. But we can see from all that you share with us that you are so much stronger than you know! Part of being strong, in my opinion, is your ability to admit to your fears and to know that it\u2019s ok to be angry and to cry and to think that none of this is fair, for you or for your wife. I know that for the first time I started feeling a little better yesterday, as finally some plans were getting made. I truly hope that as you get more info, even if it is bad info, that you will also get some relief and some ability to look forward instead of sitting in this worry pit. Keep us in the loop. We\u2019re all sending you both hugs and good thoughts.   ",

As I wrote before, the pre-op Day was so bad that I almost gave up entirely...there has got to be some better way for them to treat us....I\u2019m still dealing with nightmares about it. But, my surgery itself went well on Thursday and I was able to go home the same day and sleep in my own bed. So far I still have my nipple! My surgeon said not to get too attached, it all depends on the final path report. But for now I am very happy to still have her. I am not having too much pain at the actual lx site, behind my nipple. It\u2019s the sentinel node biopsy site under my armpit that is extremely painful. If it was only my breast, I\u2019d be fine with just Tylenol. But I understand this is normal. So I\u2019m just working through it, including making sure to do my arm exercises to keep mobility. I am back in the waiting room....my path report will hopefully be ready by next Friday. All my next steps will be based on that report...so send me good thoughts for a report that says they got good margins and there was nothing more invasive than they were expecting. Jdragr- I\u2019m sorry you are having a lot of pain. Did they do a sentinel node biopsy on you too? Hang in there and let us know when you get your path report. I\u2019ll be sending you good wishes for b9 results. Did they tell you that you could use ice packs? Those have been helping me. Pharmgirl- woo hoo, day one down! Congrats. You can do this. Iris - did you hear anything yet? bowser- let us know how things are going. We\u2019re thinking about you. Sahicks - what are your next steps? Do you have an appt for a surgical biopsy yet? Hang in there everyone. We\u2019re about to start a new year and I\u2019m sending all of us prayers and good wishes that 2018 will be a year of better health and recovery for all of us!",

Welcome Aussiemum. Glad you have a holiday coming, but totally understand the stress of possibly bad technology interfering with your communications. Maybe you could set up a specific time to call your dr\u2019s office (or have them call you on the phone in your hotel room) while you are away so you don\u2019t worry about missing a call? Debadoo, I find that there is so much helpful info on this site (both the community boards and also the regular site) which is reputable and kind. So, i stick around here and avoid Dr Google. my dr and I both think there might be a Pagets issue for me...and the Pagets thread on here is 32 pages long and took me hours and hours to read.

You're absolutely right....think about all that we know now, and the different people we are from 3 weeks ago. Stronger, more scared, but smarter and motivated to get through this.

During the week when I am at work I feel more connected and able to check in more easily....so I\u2019m going to pay attention to that. I\u2019m sitting here waiting for a call back from the on call doctor. I\u2019ve had some post-op complications from the SNB. First I got an infection in the incision and then I developed a seroma which needed to get drained on Friday (and might need that again today). I\u2019m supposed to have a second surgery on Tuesday. The path report came back and they didn\u2019t get clean margins. But, I was scheduled for an oncoplasty to repair / relocate the nipple on my lx side and then reduce the L side to make me more even again. So they are supposed to combine the reexcision to get the clean margin with the oncoplasty on Tuesday so I don\u2019t need to do a third surgery. But with the infection and seroma, I\u2019m not sure if things will stay on schedule or not....lots of anxiety. I just want to get things over and start moving forward with healing and my next treatment steps. Miss - excellent news for b9 results. Let us know what the doctor has to say when you go in for your appointment. Pharmgirl- good for you taking charge of the timing of your hair loss! That is empowering for sure. Your comparison of your wig and your bra made me laugh! That used to be the first thing I took off when I got home too....but now I have to wear one 24 /7 to keep compression on the breast that had surgery. Apparently this is going to be the case for a couple of months.... I\u2019m glad that you are doing so well managing your side effects and hope that continues for you! Bowser - so glad to hear from you! What a touching thing for you to have shaved your head in solidarity. You are a great support system. It sounds like the holidays were tiring and quiet, but you got through them. I hope wig shopping comes soon and maybe you can do a little fashion shoot with your wife and get some laughs about trying on styles that she would never really wear. I have to get through another round of surgery and by the time I recover from that the oncotype test results should be back. That will be what my doctor will use to decide whether chemo should get added to my treatment plan or if I can just do radiation. So I still have some more waiting to do for the answer to the chemo question. But I am taking good notes about the experiences and tips that you and Pharmgirl are sharing, in case I need them. Sahicks - are you still scheduled for your appointment on Tuesday? I will probably (hopefully) be off line for a couple of days right after my Tuesday surgery. But please let us know how things go. We\u2019ll be thinking about you. Jdrgr- how is your recovery going? Is your pain improving? I\u2019m thinking about everyone and sending you good healthy wishes. ",

The surgeon said it was only a 5% chance that he would have to do the graft, so we didn\u2019t talk much about it. Unfortunately I was in that 5% group...... I don\u2019t see the surgeon for another two weeks. So I\u2019m left without a lot of information right now. I am the most concerned about the impact of radiation on my skin graft. Has anyone out there had a nipple skin graft and then gone through radiation? If so, I would love to hear your experiences.

That isn't the area where the calcification cluster shows up on the L breast, so I won't be numbed already and I knowthat having it in both nipples is extra rare....but...? Fortunately (or unfortunately) my itching and scaling is present on both sides right now, so at least the dr can see it.. Thanks for your advice.",

I have had my issues well managed for more than 20 years through a combination of lots of therapy, meditating and EMDR. But my childhood abuse definitely involved my breasts. I have avoided mammograms, and had ultrasound and MRIs instead because it is the compression which triggers my issues. Earlier this week my ob/gyn insisted that I needed to get a mammogram after I learned that a sister had BC in her early 40s. Despite the technician and the Dr being lovely, I had informed them about my background and fears, I had a terrible reaction. I couldn\u2019t control my shaking and ultimately threw up andpassed out. (For anyone reading this who does not have my kind of background, please know that there was no pain at all and everyone was very sweet - this is a PTSD issue for me). I have had terrible flash backs and nightmares daily since then, I can\u2019t sleep and I haven\u2019t been able to return to work yet. My ob/gyn perscribed me a couple of Xanax, which actually made things worse....when I took them I felt like all the awfull feelings and flashbacks were still there, but in slow motion and I felt trapped and unable to get away from them. Unfortunately they found calcification in both breasts and now tell me I need to have multiple stereotactic biopsies. I can\u2019t imagine how I will be able to handle those procedures.

So after deciding to go forward with Dr. Barrio on Tuesday, MSK is so efficient that they said i could do my pre-op the same day since I was there. When they were doing that they found a heart irregularity, so suddenly were not sure they could clear me for surgery. Again, due to their efficiency, they were able to schedule me for an appt with a cardio on Wednesday, and also to see the reconstruction surgeon. So I stayed over in Westchester again (and just decided I would have to wear the same clothes and do the old wash the undies in the sink thing). So yesterday I went through a bunch of testing and consultation and eventually got cleared for surgery, as long as it was done in two steps to minimize my time under anesthesia. That was my surgeon\u2019s preference anyway, so all good with that. My first surgery will be on 12/28. So then I went to my appt with the reconstruction doc, both to talk about the reduction but also to make a plan for nipple reconstruction in case my own can\u2019t be saved. I was more than a little anxious, as this dr was the first man in any of the docs (and even nurses and administrative aids) that I was going to see. Despite my background, I haven\u2019t generally had any issues about men. I have plenty of other issues (trust me!!!), but issues with men haven\u2019t been among them. But since this whole journey has been churning up unexpected problems and issues for me, I wasn\u2019t sure how I was going to feel..... So, sometimes you just can\u2019t make this crap up....I knew the doctor\u2019s name, and it was unusual because it was ethnic. But for all I knew, that was a common name like Smith is in the US. So although I work closely with someone else with the same last name, I didn\u2019t make any connection. Whelp.....who walks into the exam room as I\u2019m sitting where in my little gown......the brother of the person I know from work. They look so much alike, it was impossible to be mistaken. So the first thing I did was ask him if his brother was a lawyer in NYC...and it surprised him and he said yes and asked if I knew him. And I said that I\u2019d known his brother for years and we were woring on a deal at the moment and I had been emailing with him just the day before. I had this moment of thinking that I couldn\u2019t imagine working with this dr, because watching him examine my body all I would be able to think about would be his brother...which would be way uncomfortable to be crossing work and medical aspects of my life. But then I had a different thought....his brother is one of the smartest people I know. So the gene pool in that family is probably pretty amazing. So I decided I was goiing to take this as a good sign and that I would be in good hands and that this was the ice breaker I needed to be comfortable with this man. So, we had a good appt. he was less certain about being able to save the nipple and so he described how they would make a fake one if necessary. Have to be honest, that part kind of made me want to pass out... but he was kind and I was able to explain to him about my background and I felt like he would take care of me. So as long as I don\u2019t get back bad path reports from my 12/28 surgery, I\u2019m scheduled for surgery with him on January 9th. Feeling much better now that I have a team and a basic plan. Thank you all for being here for me ",

I'm going prepared with a very long list of questions and at this point i have no intention of letting anyone perform any surgery on me until they have ruled out Pagets, until I have selected a plastic surgeon and until I have learned what I need to know about MX versus LX and feel i can make an informed decision. My personal situation doesn't really allow me the \"luxury\" (eye ball roll) of multiple surgeries. For those who have already responded, if you chose a LX did you also wind up with two surgeries? I don't mean a situation where you chose a LX and then the results came back with much worse cancer and you then wound up with a MX. I'm trying to figure out whether it is customary for there to be an initial surgery that is then followed by a LX. Thank you all for your patience with my questions.

I\u2019ve been struggling the past couple of days, so not been posting as much. Good news is that my first surgery is done and went well. I was able to go home same day, Thursday , and sleep in my own bed. My pre-op seed implantation and node mapping on Wednesday on the other hand was terrible and I\u2019m still struggling with flashbacks and nightmares from that. I passed out twice, once from pain, and the technician took more than 40 minutes to get the seed placed after numerous tries and eventually getting up on the procedure table with me to get the \u201cright leverage\u201d. There was a lot of blood and I was so bruised that my skin skipped red/blue /purple and went right to black. I know that my location was very difficult to work with, but there has got to be some more humane way to treat us....the damage, for me at least, of these barbaric procedures is long lasting. Today I\u2019ve still got a lot of pain at the sentinel node biopsy site, running from my armpit all the way down to my elbow. My nipple is still there however! And my breast itself doesn\u2019t feel too bad at all. If it weren\u2019t for the armpit incision, I\u2019d be fine with just Tylenol. My surgeon said not to get too attached to my nipple, but that things went well and we just have to wait to see what the final path report says... So, I will be wishing for a good path report for my New Year\u2019s resolution.... I hope you are all doing well and enjoy the holiday weekend",

I\u2019ve been medication free for so many years that I haven\u2019t done any reading for a long time. Chronic, I totally agree. I never did very well on meds, even back 20+ years ago. What worked best for me was a LOT of talk therapy and, once it became a recognized modality, EMDR. I have some nasty allergies to certain medications (which were only discovered the hard way after I was given them in an ER after a car accident, thank god I was already in the hospital!). So I try hard to just avoid meds unless they are really necessary. As my pain from the lx is improving, I am noticing that my nighttime issues are improving. I think that the pain at night, in such a sensitive area (emotionally and physically) is acting as a trigger for me. So hopefully as the pain goes away, I will get some relief from the nightmares too. I\u2019ve also noticed that each time I have had to wait for test results (this is now my third round, waiting for the path report after the lx) I feel the stress and anxiety more intensely. I feel like I\u2019ve lost resiliency with each waiting period. But, hopefully after a decent path report my last wait will be for the onco / mammaprint test.

I tried the Xanax my Dr. prescribed me over the weekend, and that actually made my flashbacks worse...i have never tried Ativan. If anyone has tried both and has any insight on differences between the two meds, I would be grateful to hear your thoughts.

So til,then, no nurse navigator or anyone to help me sort this out. I did not have any mass or tumor...just a very small calcification right behind my R nipple. During the stereo biopsy they sucked out all calls. They confirmed that with another mammogram...nothing to see other than the titanium marker. However, on the outside of the same nipple I have had scaly skin and crazy itching for two years (which my ob/gyn dismissed as nothing). So there is a concern about Pagets, which is an uncommon and very different kind of cancer....but one which often pairs up with DCIS or IDC right behind the nipple. The treatments, as far as I understand them, are very different -including the surgical treatments. I am a single person, living alone, without children or family. I don\u2019t have the financial or support resources to have multiple surgeries. I have already lost 4 days of work from complications with my biopsies. So I do not want them to cut behind my nipple and remove whatever little tissue is there and then tell me two weeks after that, sorry we now have to go back and cut off your nipple and and do more testing, etc... DownNotOut, it sounds like we have basically the same diagnosis, although I can\u2019t tell if your IDC was a micro Invasion? Would you mind sharing that, as well as the location of your bc and the steps that you have taken so far? If that is too personal, please forgive me for asking. Thank you everyone.",

I have had my issues well managed for more than 20 years through a combination of lots of therapy, meditating and EMDR. But my childhood abuse definitely involved my breasts. I have avoided mammograms, and had ultrasound and MRIs instead because it is the compression which triggers my issues. Earlier this week my ob/gyn insisted that I needed to get a mammogram after I learned that a sister had BC in her early 40s. Despite the technician and the Dr being lovely, I had informed them about my background and fears, I had a terrible reaction. I couldn\u2019t control my shaking and ultimately threw up andpassed out. (For anyone reading this who does not have my kind of background, please know that there was no pain at all and everyone was very sweet - this is a PTSD issue for me). I have had terrible flash backs and nightmares daily since then, I can\u2019t sleep and I haven\u2019t been able to return to work yet. My ob/gyn perscribed me a couple of Xanax, which actually made things worse....when I took them I felt like all the awfull feelings and flashbacks were still there, but in slow motion and I felt trapped and unable to get away from them. Unfortunately they found calcification in both breasts and now tell me I need to have multiple stereotactic biopsies. I can\u2019t imagine how I will be able to handle those procedures.

      "Content": "Nov 29, 2017 04:23PM - edited Nov 29, 2017 05:51PM by DagnyT Hi everyone. Well, I made it through. Parts were better, and parts were worse, than I had hoped. I'm going to write a separate thread about the experience that isn't focused on the PTSD side of things, so as not to worry anyone who doesn't have those kind of issues. The better parts: The EMLA cream really helped. I didn't even feel the prick of the needle, and hardly felt the burning of the lidocaine on the L side. Unfortunately not the case for the R side. My dr warned me that being just under the nipple and so close to nerves, it was going to hurt. And it did and they had difficulty with that side, so I had to go through the shot twice (when they decided to come at it from a different angle). But it was bearable and didn't last too long. Once the lidocaine took effect, I had absolutely no pain at all from the needle, the actual biopsies or the marker insertion. I took both Ativan and a pain killer, which kept me calm enough to stay still (it took 2.5 hours overall due to the difficulties with the R side). So I was able to make it through both sides! The worse parts: I was already very tender from PMS on both sides (rotten timing!!!). Despite Having taken pain medicationin advance, the compression was incredibly painful! Having just been through my mammogram a week before, the only difference was my PMS tenderness and the experience between the two was night and day. We had to take a 15 minute break and I took additional medication. So while the needles and the biopsy itself were almost pain free, the compression was unexpectedly awful. If I had not been on pain meds, I would have had to cancel the whole thing. I was also surprised by the amount of pulling and stretching and manhandling (no pun intended) of my breast that they had to do to get me placed correctly in the machine (and I have plenty of breast tissue, so that was not the issue). Everyone was lovely and had been told about my issues and they explained everything step by step. But that part was unexpected and emotionally and physically uncomfortable. The one nurse who was assigned as my \u201ccomforter\" was very kind and checked in with me and kept me informed. As some others have described, she had her hand on my back the whole time. Unfortunately, despite the fact that I was not moving at all, she kept a really firm pressure on my back that made me feel trapped and pinned down, like she was trying to keep me from escaping. That did trigger my PTSD and was honestly the worst part of the whole procedure for me. I know I could have spoken up and said something, but I was feeling guilty for having already asked for a lot of accommodations and I knew her intentions were kind. So I just clammed up. So, I didn't really get any sleep last night between nightmares/flashbacks and swapping out ice packs (definitely a really good help for the swelling and discomfort once the lidocaine wore off). But this part is behind me now. Thank you all for being a supportive place for me to share my particular issues. It is helping more than I can say",

So met with the bs at Dana Farber, who came highly recommended from a coworker that had been a patient of hers. I went to the appt prepared with about 25 questions written out regarding things from interpreting my path report, to radiation and chemoquestions and surgery questions. Pharmgirl, since we have similar dx (although more about that below) if you want to pm me I am happy to email you my question list....it is very comprehensive! The bs basically said, she couldn\u2019t answer most of my questions about my dx because the samples from the biopsies are small and they need to wait and see the bigger tissue that they would remove during surgery and wait for a final path report. Although she DID tell me that I should not consider myself to have DCIS with a microinvasion....that I should consider myself to have IDC. Because at any time that there is an invasive component shown on a biopsy, they pretty much just move on to ignoring the DCIS and treat the invasive cancer. That was kind of disheartening.....so pharmgirl, be prepared to maybe hear something like that. All my questions about other things, like radiation and hormone therapy...she just said you\u2019ll have to talk to someone else about that! Which goes back to my original posting.....why start with a surgeon rather than the cancer doc? I am now back to trying to get an appt with the medical oncologist and the radiation oncologist, and the only reason she was going to support that was because I told her that the answers from the radiologist would impact my decision to do a LX vs a MX. So, a frustrating experience that still left me with a lot of unanswered questions. I have a second opinion appointment with a different bs at Sloan Kettering on Tuesday....maybe that one will be better.",

I don\u2019t have a doctor or a care location yet. My local ob/gyn has been useless and because she has ignored both my physical Pagets symptoms for two years and my PTSD concerns about diagnostic testing, I have no confidence in her anymore. She already told me she did not have any rrecommendations at any recognized breast care programs and basically told me good luck taking care of this on my own. My very lovely radiologist who did my biopsies also told me she did not have any referrals she could give me that were not local, and she recommended earlier that I be seen at a major facility due to my complicating factors. So I\u2019m not sure what to do next....",

That\u2019s why I put the issue of my abuse right in the title of this thread....so readers could be informed. You wonderful people are really helping me deal with some of the more distinct problems I am working through.. and knowing that you have all walked in my shoes with bc is incredibly meaningful and lets me know that there are parts of this journey that I don\u2019t need to explain....you\u2019ve all been there. So it makes me feel like I have the ability to talk more about the other aspects that I need advice on. I am very grateful to you all.",

It was a long day (6 hours of driving and crappy traffic!) and didn\u2019t go so well, so I wasn\u2019t up to posting last night. So the good part is that after poo pooing my Pagets concern when we were talking, once the bd bothered to actually look at my nipple area she agreed that it needed to be biopsied. So I put my plan in place, pulled out my handy EMLA cream and asked her if we could do it in 20 min (I had already taken my Ativan earlier because I found myself shaking uncontrollably once I got to the hospital). She wasn\u2019t the one who even did the biopsy, it was her nurse! But I made it through, and it was a lot less painful and stressful than the other biopsies. I did get a little satisfaction because I warned the nurse (who was very sweet) that I am a big bleeder. She smiled and reassured me not to worry about it, she\u2019d take good care of me. Well.......I left blood all over that exam room!! By the end of everything, after I bled through 4 different dressings (and unfortunately my bra) she laughed and said I wasn\u2019t kidding about being a bleeder! I should get results from the Pagets test on Monday. That timing should work out, I hope, since I have a second appt with a bs from Sloan Kettering on Tuesday morning. I\u2019m not sure if my expectations were too high, or my difficult emotional state made it hard to relate to the bs yesterday or if she just wasn\u2019t a good fit. The first thing I explained to her was about my abuse background and the difficulties I had been having with procedures so far. She listened appropriately and said that she could understand that this was going to be a hard process because of my trauma issues. But then when I got out my list of questions (I had typed it out in advance to make sure i wouldn\u2019t forget things) she started brushing off a lot of things I asked. She told me most questions I had about my actual diagnosis and path report couldn\u2019t be answered until they had taken everything out and done a final path review. Ok, that makes sense. But when I got to my questions about treatment options, radiation, chemo, hormone therapy she just said that she couldn\u2019t answer any of those things and I would have to talk to the RO and medical oncologist after surgery. When I pressed and said that some of the answers to my questions would impact my surgical decision, she sighed and said ok she would see if I could get an appt with the RO. And when I asked her about the Pagets she looked right at me and she said that she understood with my background that I wanted to be in control of things, but that I needed to stop doing that and let her do her job and that I was being \u201cvery controlling\u201d and she would decide what she thought was medically necessary. When she did finally look at my nipple her tone changed a bit and she did agree that a biopsy should be done. When I asked her about interactions with meds for PTSD, she said that was between me and my psychiatrist and that as long as I didn\u2019t take 20 ativan right before surgery, then it wouldn\u2019t impact anything she did. So I left with lots of unanswered questions and not feeling much of a connection with the dr and waiting to hear about getting an appt with a RO. But at least I got the Pagets biopsy, so that alone was worth the trip. And, I was disappointed / mad enough that I made calls yesterday and sent out all my info to a different bs at Sloan Kettering and was able to get myappointment for Tuesday. So I guess I will be able to compare and contrast the two doctors and see how much of this is me and how much is just about a good fit. Thanks everyone for listening and checking in on me",

I will post more tomorrow when I have more energy, and hopefully sign off for surgery (pre-op visit made them worried about some heart issues....so having to follow up on that tomorrow). But what I need to say to all of you on this thread is a very heartfelt thank you ! You all supported me and validated my feelings that the bs I saw at Dana Farber was not the right person for me. Today I met with Dr. Barrio at MSK and things could not have been more different. She was kind, she listened to me and had compassion for my PTSD issues, she answered my questions and didn\u2019t tell me that I\u2019d have to ask other people for answers because \u201cthat wasn\u2019t what she does\u201d. When I asked her if she thought she could save my nipple, she said that she wasn\u2019t sure, but that I would not wake up without a nipple...even if it had to come off in a second surgery. She actually said that she was not going to do anything that I had not pre-authorized, and that patients give up enough control when they go into the operating room and it would be unthinkable to her for me to worry about waking up without a breast or a nipple...the total opposite of the bs at DF who actually said I would need to sign consent for additional procedures so she could decide what was best in the operating room! Without your kind support, I might not have been strong enough to get a second opinion and might have ended up with so much more worry and problems than necessary.i now feel confident that I have a kind surgeon who is seeing me as a person and will help me though this process. Thankyou, thank you, thank you!",

I have had my issues well managed for more than 20 years through a combination of lots of therapy, meditating and EMDR. But my childhood abuse definitely involved my breasts. I have avoided mammograms, and had ultrasound and MRIs instead because it is the compression which triggers my issues. Earlier this week my ob/gyn insisted that I needed to get a mammogram after I learned that a sister had BC in her early 40s. Despite the technician and the Dr being lovely, I had informed them about my background and fears, I had a terrible reaction. I couldn\u2019t control my shaking and ultimately threw up andpassed out. (For anyone reading this who does not have my kind of background, please know that there was no pain at all and everyone was very sweet - this is a PTSD issue for me). I have had terrible flash backs and nightmares daily since then, I can\u2019t sleep and I haven\u2019t been able to return to work yet. My ob/gyn perscribed me a couple of Xanax, which actually made things worse....when I took them I felt like all the awfull feelings and flashbacks were still there, but in slow motion and I felt trapped and unable to get away from them. Unfortunately they found calcification in both breasts and now tell me I need to have multiple stereotactic biopsies. I can\u2019t imagine how I will be able to handle those procedures. Has anyone else had problems like this or can anyone recommend some coping techniques for the PTSD? dx-12/1/17 DCIS R breast w/microinvasion IDC; ER+/PR borderline+; HER2- Log in to post a reply",

And chronic, you\u2019re totally right. I sent the brother than I work with (we\u2019re both finance lawyers) a note and told him I had met his Dr brother. I got an immediate, and lovely, response that I would be in good hands with his brother and that he is even more of a wise ass than my colleague, so I would be sure to like him. That made me feel comfortable enough to laugh and tell my friend to warn his brother that if my \u201cgirls\u201d didn\u2019t look good after all of this then I was going to find a way to dig up old brotherly grudges and have my friend sue his brother. So, all lighthearted and overall positive. I\u2019m now feeling a bit concerned about Lymphedema....did either of you suffer from this? My surgeon did explain the risks to me, but I wasn\u2019t able to focus enough on it when she was talking to me, too much;else to try and take in. Now I\u2019m realizing she said that this was something that could happen even years after surgery....and that scares me. I\u2019ve been working on visualizing a future point next year when this dx is behind me and I amrecovered from surgery and radiation and feeling like I would be functioning normally. A lingering and lifetime risk of some pretty nasty LE symptoms was not in my future plans. Any experiences to share? Thanks",
