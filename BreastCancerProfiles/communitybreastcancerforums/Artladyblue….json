I live in the Catskills and it will be well over 2 hour drive each way. Most people think I am crazy and want me to go local. Where I live there is only 1 breast surgeon and she is all booked up. Plus if it is malignant I feel I want the \"best\", and know that I will try everything that is top notch and up to date. I was/am so discouraged to see so many negative comments about MSK and yes I have been hearing that for many years...but I just felt that I needed the best up to date info and treatment.  My question to you is, is it doable to live hours away and yet go there for treatment? In my heart I do feel I have \"something\"...and the radiologist told me to \"prepare\". But I live alone and I am newly moved to this area so I have no good friends established yet who I could count on for driving, etc. I am feeling discouraged by the comments about MSK so I was thankful to hear yours...what was your treatment and how were  you able to organize that when you lived 3 hours away??? Thank You - Bonnie :>) (Artladyblue)",
