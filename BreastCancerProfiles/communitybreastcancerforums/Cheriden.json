I made a decision in December to do Vitamin C IVs and started exercising. Imwas in remission by April. I managed to not need surgery or radiation so far.  I've been going along in lala land. Thought I should go off Herceptin because I want the port out. My onc freaked out. I did more research and understand why she did! Are any of you still doing Herceptin?  I'm also on arimidex and would like to get off it as well and continue with the holistic/naturopathic route. Am I crazy? I'm starting to doubt myself. C",

The rare thing about it is there is no cancer in my breasts. All the mammograms I have had did not pick it up. It originated in the tissue bedside my breast under my arm. That is why it got away from us! Is there anyone else out there with the same type of breast cancer? The doctors told me it happens in less than 1% of cases. Starting chemo on Wednesday as there is no point in operating. Log in to post a reply",

Had a mammogram every year, although all for not. I am happy we can chat about it though. They couldn't do surgery on me, probably never, because it is in the tissue beside my breast. I will be a chronic cancer patient. I think of it the same way diabetics have to cope with insulin shots. i love my oncologist, she is awesome which is very important. I start chemo on Wednesday. 6 treatments, one every 3 weeks, then herceptin for probably 1/12 years, radiation, then pills. Go buy the book Kicking Cancer's Ass by Dena Mendes. It gives hope, lots of it. I plan on kicking it's butt and I will be here for you too. My husband is a mess, I feel I have to be strong for him. We will live for years and it is better than getting hit by a bus! Also I'd rather it be me instead of my husband or kids. Hang in there kiddo, we can DO this. Take care Wanda.",
