They took 3 samples, when I went back to the cons she said it was a B9 papilloma but it still needed removing as you couldnt tell if they were entirely B9. Yet when I first saw her she said that they would more than likely not remove it.   I do not understand it all. Anyway had the op 6 days ago and will get the reults Friday and I am so nervous.  Even though on the day of the op the cons said it would be nothing she still said that I may need more surgery if on the rare chance it was something more.  I am getting very bad sharp, stabbing pains which are some days worse than the other. It is better when I lay down.  Hope it gets better soon.  Ps I am in the uk and live in Leics Jo x",
