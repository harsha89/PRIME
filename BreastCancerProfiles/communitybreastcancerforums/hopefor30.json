I was sent to a liver specialist and it was decided that even though the tamoxifen is causing the fatty liver, I should stay on it.   I am premenopausal, so tamoxifen is the only treatment for me unless I have my ovaries removed. My onc said I need to be watched and if the liver enzymes go up at all, he would consider ovarian supression and switching me to an AI.    For now, I am still on tamoxifen.   I have also had some uterine lining issues and may end up having a hysterectomy  -- so I might just takek my ovaries out then.  The whole thing is just depressing.  I have had 7 surgeries over the last 3 years so I don't want another one, but I don't want a damaged liver on top of everything else.   So I havene't decided what I am going to do. I used to be hypothyroid as well -- but had my whole thyroid removed for thyroid cancer last June.  Not sure how that impacts my liver -- I take levoxyl and my TSH must be kept suppressed. Anyway, I hope you get an answer to your problems.    For what it's worth, none of my doctors were overly concerned about the fatty  liver.  I didn't like it, but I guess it's a little reassuring that they were not too worried.   I gave up alcohol after my breast cancer diagnosis  -- maybe had an occassional glass of wine at holidays -- now I don't drink at all.",

I was referred to a gyn surgeon who intially decided I should be followed by MRI.   After 3 months, I asked for a CA125 and it came back sllightly elevated.   That did it for me...ovaries had to come out.    I also opted to take out my  uterus because it was enlarged to the size of a 16-20 week pregnancy.   I think due to tamoxifen, but no one would admit that.    I had laparascopic total hysterectomy -- one night in hospital.   They did do a frozen section on ovaries in OR -- all was benign, so no big incision.   I have four tiny scars -- one in belly button, two on sides and one near pubic bone.   Very easy surgery compared to my DIEP reconstruction.  Easy recovery. I had no hot flashes for about two weeks.   I wonder if that means I had a lot of estrogen in my system and it took that long to go away or if I had so little it took a while for my body to notice the difference.    Hot flashes are regular but bearable -- a few a day and I feel hot at night, but no real night sweats. I have noticed joint pain in my neck and feet and hands. -- and I am still on tamoxifen which before gave me no side effects at all.   I see my onc in September and will transition to an AI -- I am very nervous about the side effects since I already feel achy from the loss of estrogen. For  me, I think I made the right decision.   I could not live with the elevated CA125 and just monitor things.    I have had both breast cancer and thyroid cancer in the last 3 years.   I do worry about all the stuff I read online about having a shortened life span from removing ovaries, but having cancer is worse.   I at least have some peace of mind now....I know I don't have ovarian cancer and I am glad to be rid of my oversize and uncomfortable uterus. Good luck with your decison.   Send me a PM if you have more specific questions.",

I have been very happy with BI -- doctors there are great and I have full confidence in their ability, but I can see why you are upset.  I can't imagine they would recommend saving the breast if they thought it was risky --  who is your surgeon?  Another thing to consider is whether or not you will get a good cosmetic result with the lumpectomy.   My lumpectomy (which was done at Newton Wellesley) took out almost half my breast -- it looked caved in and deformed and my breast surgeon at BI said it would get worse after radiation. Since I didn't want radiation and it didn't look good anyway, I had no trouble going with the mastectomy -- I had unilateral DIEP recon and am happy with the results which look much better than my deformed boob after lumpectomy. I know this is a tough decision, but remember -- it is your decision.   Since BI thinks you are OK to save the breast, you have that option -- if you are not comfortable with that, then you can have a mastectomy.   It is worse when they recommend a mastectomy and you don't want one..... Good luck with your decision and if you have any questions about doctors at BI, feel free to PM me. M.",

I \"discovered\" my own thyroid nodule.   Had strange sensation in my throat - lots of reflux, and some trouble swallowing -- my neck felt funny.   Told my PCP, who was also an endocrinologist, that something was wrong with my neck and since I had had bc I was worried about lymph nodes in my neck.    She repeately told me I was fine and not to worry -- needless to say she is no longer my doctor.

So, my advice is to get thyroid nodules checked out -- I knew something wasn't right with me and I was right.   For now, I am thyroid cancer free, but thyroid cancer, although curable and \"mild\" can still recur at any time.  So, even though the prognosis is very good, you still have the stress of being monitored and undergoing body scans etc. every 6-12 months. Is thyroid cancer connected to breast cancer?   Who knows?  I have asked my onc and have been referred to the cancer genetics divison at my hospital -- they do not think it is related, but have agreed they will meet and talk with me since it is rare.....but after reading this thread, it appears I am not alone.  I am convinced it is connected....just hope I don't have some bad gene that can be passed onto my kids.",

Regarding lumpectomy vs. mastectomy -- it is really a personal decision.   If your tumor is large or there is more than one, they often recommend mastectomy.   My tumor was tiny, but I had a lot of DCIS, so I opted for a mastectomy and had immediate DIEP reconstruction which was the right decision for me.     Although they tell you that survival for mastectomy and lumpectomy are the same, I believe local recurrence (in the same breast) is higher with lumpectomy -- also I wanted to avoid radiation which I was able to to by having a mastectomy. Good luck - you are at the worst part of this journey -- being diagnosed -- I know it doesn't seem possible, but you will feel better after you meet with your doctor and have a plan. M.",

In my case, I lot of tissue was also removed -- I had a 6cm span of DCIS -- I ended up having a mastectomy with DIEP recon -- the crack is gone and it now looks pretty good.  If yours doesn't improve, you could always consult with a plastic surgeon.",

As to showering, my PS recommended a product called the kangaroo belt -- made by Turner Products -- it is a terrycloth belt with a pouch that goes around your waist when you shower and holds the drains -- very easy to use --  I bought two and took turns drying them out between showers.   The hospital where I had my surgery had also attached clips to the drains so when changing they could be clipped to your clothes, robe, etc so they wouldn't get caught. Say a prayer I don't need my drain back! M.",

It is not the MRI that makes the biopsy more or less painful.   The MRI is just the method to locate what they are trying to biopsy. -- Sometimes it is the location of the tumor that causes more or less pain -- depending on how difficult it is to access it. Don't panic too much based on what your client told you -- more painful than a double mastectomy?   No way, in my case.   Just tough to lie on that uncomfortable MRI table for awhile without moving....you'll be fine.
