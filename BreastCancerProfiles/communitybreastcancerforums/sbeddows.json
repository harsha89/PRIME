Thank you to everyone for your support. It's so hard to go to Google and look at stats and outcomes then not panic. So I am going to stop. Did anyone take curcumin?! I have started taking it to hopefully help......the hardest thing is sitting doing nothing so at least this might be helping things..... waiting for treatment is the worst part of this all......nothing is being done to kill or stop this thing so I figure I will try to do some diy treatment until I can get some chemo....fingers crossed....",

Bone scan was yesterday and brain mri tomorrow....Then ct on Tuesday and Oncologist Wednesday. ...busy busy busy.....had to talk to a fertility specialist yesterday but I think there isn't much option for me there ànd I have to concentrate on being here for the baby I have rather than worry about if I can have more. Still don't know he receptor status or grade. I figure I will find out everything on Wednesday so no point chasing up the results there......I just need to eat clean and get mean and fight this beast right now :)",

Just knowing that there are people that I can talk to that understand helps a great deal. I guess just knowing that right now it is growing and potentially spreading is what is driving me crazy. I appreciate that it must feel somewhat easier when you have a treatment plan in place. Being a worrier my thoughts are that even when I find out on Tuesday exactly what is what ( I am lucky enough to be going to a rapid diagnostic clinic) I am still going to have to wait for some kind of treatment whether surgical or chemical is put in place, and this is just more and more time for it to potentially spread if it hasn't already. I am just about at my limit with worry now.....to have to then have things confirmed and wait to get them sorted I am not sure I can handle esp if mx. I feel like I need to stop whining and complaining but I also just have to get these thoughts out there. I really want to be a strong survivor but I already feel like a pessimist.....Anyway",
