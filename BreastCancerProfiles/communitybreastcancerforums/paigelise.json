And also my final pathology report told my Her status (mine was negative) and the grade...how fast growing it is.  For your appointment tomorrow...try to bring someone with you and have them take notes.  Or bring a tape recorder.  I also found it helpful to get copies of all my tests, have a separate calendar with all my appointments on it.  Take it one step at a time.  You will have some decisions to make along the way of your treatment.  Go with your gut instincts and get 2nd opinions if needed.  The worst part of the journey for me was the beginning.  Once I knew what I was dealing with and had a treatment plan things got better.  I also took a low dose of anti-anxiety medicine (Ativan) which helped out. I know it seems overwhelming at times but take it one step at a time! Wendy ",

Maybe get a 2nd opinion?  What are your chances for recurrance if you DON\"t get the radiation?  Just keep researching it and reading on here to help you make your decision.  Good Luck! Wendy",

Let us know how you are doing!  I am also a dog mom of 2 dogs!  Wendy",

As for already talking about scheduling a mastectomy that seems a bit rushed to me. Even with mine being 3 cms and invasive I was able to get a lumpectomy. I do think you should get a 2nd opinion.  You are doing the right thing by taking a step back and assessing the situation!  I sometimes feel like I was sucked into a whirlwind and I am constantly researching to try and stay on top of things. Good luck to both of you!  Let us know what happens! Wendy ",
