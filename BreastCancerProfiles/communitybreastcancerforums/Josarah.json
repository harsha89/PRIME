I\u2019ve had a cough for a couple of weeks and decided to get my GPs nurse practitioner to listen to my chest. She said as no fever not likely to be chest infection but?? Few crackles in chest so prescribed antibiotics just in case. Tbh I feel ok and I\u2019m not sure whether taking the antibiotics could delay my chemo? But on the other hand if I don\u2019t take them and do have a chest infection it will delay chemo. What should I do? I would be finished antibiotics before first treatment.",

I\u2019m starting neoadjuvant chemo on 13th March and then will have mastectomy. On ultrasound all my nodes looked ok so I\u2019m hopeful. At the moment I\u2019m trying to prepare the household for mummy being less able but I\u2019ve come down with a cough which I\u2019m paranoid will delay my treatment. It\u2019s still all so unreal and as of yet I haven\u2019t had any time alone to really process what\u2019s happening. When does all this start to feel real",
