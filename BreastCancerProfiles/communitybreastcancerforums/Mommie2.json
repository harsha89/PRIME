As you know everything is moving so fast that it's hard to find very much \"Me Time\" to reply, post updates...etc... I met with the Oncologist as well as my Second Opinion Surgeon since I last posted. Due to the HER2 Positive status he will have me on 4 different Chemo Drugs and I'm scheduled for the Chemo Port to be surgically placed on Monday. I'm being scheduled for all the Bone, CT scans, Genetic Testing, Chemo class...etc My Breast MRI is tomorrow. My Breast Cancer Stage was changed from the previous Stage 3 to IIB. I have decided to go with my 2nd opinion Surgeon who Specializes ONLY in breasts. I will eventually have to do Radiation 5 days a week for..I think 4 months...don't quote me on that. There's so much to take in. All in all..my Spirits are great. I feel like I'm in great hands with the choice of Specialists we have chosen thus far. I still need to return the phone call to the PS office that called me as I was walking into another appt yesterday. I just wanted to give an update and let you all know that I appreciate the love, kindness and support that I feel here. I will be around as I can and will be reviewing more Posts on this website to better my knowledge from you all. Thanks again. ‚ù§",

I have referrals coming from everywhere it seems. There's so many doctors to see, so many tests to do, treatments will have to be figured out. And you hope it's the right treatment for your body makeup. Which I know that's what the path results and blood work is for...but u hope the Dr. reads it all and doesn't make a mistake on anything which may cause ill effects. It was also brought to my attention about reconstruction immediately after the double Mastectomy. I thought about leaning towards the DIEP Flap but I haven't had enough time to research all the options and what the benefits vs non benefits would be to each option. I do have to say, although myself and my husband feel overwhelmed with so much at one time, it's so relieving to know that there have been others in our same shoes that have been successful in their battle. I appreciate you all for all of your encouraging words. I hope to get back to each of your replies and respond. You all have been through SO much. Although I am sorry you have had to endure the storm, I am in awww at the \"new home\" you have built after the storm was over. I appreciate each and every one of you. (((Hugs)))",
