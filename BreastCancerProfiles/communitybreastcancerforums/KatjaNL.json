My surgeries have not finished yet, awaiting the date for the second lumpectomy to achieve clear margins... I thought of getting the second opinion on the after surgery treatment, would be interesting to read about this! As there still remains the possibility for mastectomy for me in the future (if margins come back non-clear again), I was wondering on how long does this surgery take? You are very brave all, much strength and good luck with treatment to all!",

Can totally relate to the situation when you know the results are available but you have to wait for appointment. Got my results yesterday - think I have enough information to add Dx to my profile now. I had one good and one bad news - lymph node is clean and that's the great great great relief! But the operation was not successful - margins of the excision have not been negative, which means either additional lumpectomy or mastectomy is required. I'm seeing my plastic surgeon on Monday. I'm doing my research now on pros and cones of both.... Mastectomy won't be followed by radiation or chemo in my case, only Tamoxifen. But lumpectomy, which is still my preference, will be followed by radiation + Tamoxifen.",

Did my MBI/BSGI scan today - although they say the pressure is less than during mammogram, it's been totally same (but now after the operation on Aug 31 it was horrible)...One round of pictures took 8 minutes when you have to sit still with a squeezed boob... They made three projections of the left (where I had a lumpectomy) and two of the right (nothing found there so far). The doctor was not there and now I have to wait till Monday for the results.. Fingers crossed nothing new and more clarity for the next steps. Hugs and strength to all!",

Have been diagnosed with ILC (3.8cm) mid July and had lumpectomy + sentinel node removal on 31st of August. Tomorrow have an appointment with my surgeon for the results... very anxious. Having read a number of forum threads during this week, I would like to say that you all sound so encouraging! I still have lots and lots to learn, even to use the word 'cancer' in relation to myself, but I'm glad to join the community and believe in good! ",
