Flowers are great, but the care package made me feel even more concerned for. In addition to the items mentioned she put magazines, coffee, lotions etc. It was not created with a theme of BC ( i.e pink) it was just a theme of thoughtful items. Loved it!!",

I spoke to my son's football coach and my daughters softball coach also. I knew the kids both had  great support systems in place. My mom and sister have both had BC many years ago and that helped the kids realize it was going to be okay. Good luck to you and remember to breathe.....",

I suppose it is true that people just don't know how to react or what to say to someone when they hear their cancer news. I have been so disappointed by people that I have been \"friends\" with for years and have comforted in their time of need. I have learned to ask for support when I need it.",
