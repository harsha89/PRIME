The MRI identified it as a \"Suspected 10mm fibroadenoma\" and states it is \"a well marginated nodule.  It demonstrates persistent contrast enhancement and does contain central regions of decreased signal intensity.  This is felt to likely represent a fibroadenoma.  A focused right breast sonogram is recommended for further evaluation.\"  The bs himself noted the following on the report:  \"apparent benign lesion at 4:00\". HOWEVER, it's the focused sonogram (which I had yesterday) results that are freaking me out.  The sonogram results read:  \"A well marginated, oval shaped, hypoechoic nodule with a maximum diameter of approx 9mm was noted....The long axis of this nodule is parallel to the skin surface.  This also demonstrates a sharp posterior wall and posterior acoustic enhancement.  This does contain a central linear region of increased echogenicity.  The sonographic appearance of this nodule is suggestive of an intramammary lymph node with a thickened cortical mantle.  As the patient does have carcinoma with the right breast, this is SUSPICIOUS FOR AN INTRAMAMMARY NODAL METASTASIS.  If clinically indicated, a sonographically guided biopsy of the nodule may be performed for further evaluation.\"  I did an internet search for \"Intramammary Nodal Metastasis\" and found only 2 articles, both of which indicated that this was a precursor to decreased survival and further lymph node involvement in the axillary region.  As you can imagine, I'm going crazy here.  I also searched this site and found nothing.  The bs is saying that IF this nodule is benign, he will recommend lumpectomy.  IF it's found to be malignant, he will recommend a mastectomy of the right breast.  HELP !!!!!!!!!  Does anyone have any experience with this??  Dx 3/10/2009, IDC, 2cm, Stage I, Grade 3, 0/1 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

After alot of research and careful consideration, I'm going with a Lumpectomy and SNB.  The risks of re-excision (and even Mastectomy) have been explained to me, but my bs feels I'm a good candidate for the surgery.  He still feels the actual tumor is small (the remains of the cystic sac is 2 cm) and is \"probably not\" in my nodes.  I've done a ton of research on reoccurence, etc.  I hope I'm making the right decision.  All you can do is weigh your options, do the research and move forward with what feels like the best choice.  The surgery is on April 13th. ",

I'm sorry ANY OF US have to go through this.  I'm gaining strength through other experiences and the information everyone here provides.  That's so comforting.  If it's the last thing I do, I WILL pay that forward.  Thanks for everything!

As far as adding your dx to your profile, there's a section under your profile you can go to in order to add the information.  I think you go to \"My Home\" at the top of the page and that will lead you to where you need to go.  I'll be thinking about you as well Angela, and I'm sending you Hugs!!   We can do this!

I went to the breast surgeon today and I think I got really good news.  Atleast it feels that way.  He did an ultrasound of both breasts and a full exam.  He found nothing to worry about in the left breast and no sign of any swelling under my arms.  He said the cyst was \"incidental\" and not caused by the cancer.  It was just one of those things that may have helped in that it MADE ME go for a mammogram.  He said he feels the actual tumor is \"probably small\".  When I asked about node involvement, he said \"probably not\".  He did find a tiny nodule in another spot on my right breast and said it was not a big deal.  In short, nothing is lighting up and screaming. I spoke to my girlfriend who was diagnosed the first time with IDC 17 years ago and had a reoccurance 2 years ago and she said a doctor rarely says anything like that unless he's pretty comfortable with his assessment.  I'm praying she's right.  I thought the tumor was HUGE based on the size of the cyst, but apparently the surgeon doesn't think so.  He does nothing but this so I would think he knows exactly what he's looking at.  Atleast I'm praying that's the case.  My girlfriend told me she was \"elated\" by what I was telling her.  That she felt it was really good news. They set me up for a breast MRI next Thursday (3/19) and are also in the process of setting an appointment with an oncologist he recommended and whom he works with extensively.  They will get me in after the MRI and before I go back to the breast surgeon on March 26th.  The doc said we'll discuss mastectomy vs lumpectomy at that time.  I guess he wants to confirm his suspicions with the MRI.  Does that sound right to you guys? I told the bs I was concerned that we weren't moving faster and he said not to be.   He said its usually approx a month between diagnosis and surgery.  What do you guys think of everything I've said?  I was expecting the worst, and right now this seems like a tiny bit of good news.  Do you agree?  Anything you can offer in the way of insight and experience would be so appreciated.  Love, Kathy PS.  They also offered me the BRAC Analysis test based on the fact that I'm adopted and have no genetic family history.  They said it might cost me as much as $3000.00 depending on whether my insurance was willing to work with the lab.  I took it.  Knowledge is power.  Did I do the right thing?",

Lumpectomy and reconstruction soon as well.  God.....its all so much at once.  I'm looking for that sunnier place too, Linda and I believe if anyone can guide us there, it's our more \"experienced sisters\".  I asked my good friend who is a 14 year bs survivor until 2 years ago when she had another bout with IDC Stage IV and she assures me I WILL laugh again. Jill, Deana, Sue, Terry, Val and Linda....Thank you from the bottom of my heart.  I'll keep you posted on what the surgeon says and how things are progressing. Love, Kathy ",

Have a wonderful time in Illinois!  You certainly deserve it!  Thank you again for being so encouraging and helpful.  You're a sweetheart, Sue.  I've posted a new topic with questions, by the way.  Perhaps someone has some insight or a story similar to mine to share.   ",

Well, I started Rads on October 1st.  My final day is November 12th.  On the good side, I'm in and out of the Rads center in 20 minutes.  They're waiting for me when I arrive (at 10:30 AM) and take me right in.  They're incredibly efficient and the 3 techs who do the treatment everyday are super sweet.  I have 2 young women and 1 young man (they can't be older than 26 or 27).  I have to admit, the young guy freaked me out at first, but he did a really great job of making me feel comfortable.  On the down side, I started feeling very tired after 8 treatments.  Not the usual tired, but more like a lessened version of the fatigue you experience with Chemo (had 3 months of TCH - finished 7/22).  I'm also experiencing nipple tenderness and those pains in the breast so many are describing.  Hate to say this, but reading that others are having these pains actually encouraged me (sorry about that!!).  My skin is looking fine so far, but I have to admit that the fatigue is upsetting me.  After feeling like crap for months, I was finally starting to feel more like me when I started Rads.  I hadn't counted on the fatigue hitting this quickly.  I also didn't count on the pain in my breast and the nipple discomfort.  No one warned me about that and to be honest, it scared the bejesus out of me.  For some odd reason, I felt stronger emotionally during Chemo and my surgeries than I do now.  I don't know what it is.  Maybe after 7 months of doing this whole cancer thing, I'm just emotionally drained or maybe the reality and the \"new normal\" is actually hitting me.  Who knows.  All I know is I'm jumpier than I was and I have less patience for those around me.  I guess frustration would be the best description of how I'm feeling.  Like I just want this to be OVER so I can deal with the future.  Anyone else experiencing that ?  Also, I'm using Eucerin Calming Cream on the entire area from my collarbone down to about 3 inches below my breast and from between the girls where my tattoo is to around to my back where my other tattoo is located.  I'm using a generous amount twice a day.....right after treatment and before I go to bed.  I'm also using Eucerin Oil bodywash and their itch cream (which I haven't needed yet).  It's working very well !!  I have the softest right boob on the planet and so far, my skin is not breaking down !!  LOL!!  I also have Aquafor in case I need it.  The Eucerin Calming Cream is not as greasy as the Aquafor and doesn't stain my clothing or my bra.  I also try to go without my bra (which is a regular non-underwire) as much as I can.  I think I'll pickup some Pure Aloe Gel as well.  Can't hurt !!  My best wishes to all the brave October Gals.  Lotsa love and hang in there !!   ",
