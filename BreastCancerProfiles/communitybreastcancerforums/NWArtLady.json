You have to be your own best advocate in the health care system, I'm afraid.  Your NP sounds like a great support, I 'm glad she's on your side! When I have questions about specific tests, etc., I find the Mayo clinic's website a good place to get good, trustworthy information (I'm a librarian).  For example, here is their site with info on breast tissue biopsies: Mayo Clinic Breast biopsy I highly suggest you bring someone along with you (partner, friend, family member, etc.) to your appointment.  Appointments with doctors can be overwhelming and it is so helpful to have another set of ears in the room with you.  Also, ask the person who goes with you to bring a pad of paper and a pen to take notes. It's amazing how helpful it is to have these notes to go over later on when your mind is not swimming so much. And don't let them pass on you saying that you have no family history of BC. I don't either and yet here I am! That is old information. Get the answers you need so you can sleep at night. Good luck! I'll be thinking about you on Thursday!!",

The mammogram will hopefully give you more information.  When I don't understand a term or process, I like to go to the Mayo Clinic website as they explain things very well and I trust the information will be accurate: Mayo Clinic I think the discussion about doing a biopsy that will remove the lump is due to the size of the lump: in the process of taking the biopsy, the lump would be removed because of the amount of tissue that needs to be taken to run the tests on it. Does that make sense? It seems like a lot of the professionals are thinking it's benign - here's to hoping they are right!!",

I also was fortunate enough to be able to take small, 20 minute naps while at work and that helped tremendously.  Walking every day also kept me going. Exercise is crucial! So is moisturizing. I grew to really appreciate shea butter lotions. I wish you the best as you go through this very difficult time. The ladies and gentlemen on these boards are the best and always full of good advice.

I have always had a thing for blue hair and one of the first things my husband and I did was to go wig shopping; I got a gorgeous blue one that gets me compliments wherever I go.  I also got one that goes from yellow to green (top to bottom) and is beautiful. I work at an arts college and some of the students gave me wigs: a white one and a blonde one. I'm really known for the blue one, especially in the chemo ward. Prior to chemo, I had waist-length blonde hair... I'm a photographer, so I started a photo series wherein I've been photographing myself with bald friends (they've all been male thus far).  Good fun! On a serious note, when I was diagnosed I stopped and really looked at my life. I asked myself if I was doing what I wanted to do and is there anything I would change. I'm happy to say that no, there isn't anything I would change (that is in my control)!  That was a real gift. I love the stories, ladies! Keep them up!",

If it will make you feel less anxious, perhaps if you tuck a plastic bag in your day bag to use in case you get nauseous? I find that if I prepared for something to happen, then it does not usually happen.  I'm not sure if someone has already said this, so forgive me everyone if I am repeating.  I found that it was a good idea for me to bring a bag along with items for the day as the infusions can take several hours (accessing my port, blood draw, onc visit, infusion, etc) so I brought my laptop and 2 sets of headphones with a splitter along so my husband and I could watch a movie during my infusion. A good book for each of you is nice, as are snacks.  My infusion floor had sandwiches for the patients, but no food for the visitors, so my husband would either bring something or step out to get himself a bite to eat.   Note, if you have any food expenses while at the hospital, these can be deducted from your taxes, so keep you receipt! This also goes for mileage and parking expenses. I'm so glad your friend is going with you!!  This whole thing is tiring physically, mentally, and emotionally. Whenever a friend or family member offers help, take them up on it. It does both you and them great good and makes your relationships stronger.",

For the bad taste in my mouth and to avoid mouth sores, I rinsed and spit after each meal and snack a mixture of water and a little baking soda.  I was getting mouth sores prior to doing this and they went away and stayed away with this \"mouthwash.\"  I kept a little container of baking soda at my desk and would pop into the ladies room with my mug and baking soda and make myself a little mixture and would rinse and spit 3-4 times.  Helped with the funny taste as well.  I now use a toothpaste with baking soda because I liked the clean feeling so much! I loved my lorezapam during treatment and still keep some nearby (just in case).  It helped with the anxiety and fear and helped me sleep.  I had it with my infusion (along with anti-nausea meds, chemo, and saline). The chemos are cumulative, so do work that fact into your plan. I found that if I took 20 minute naps during the day around 3:00, that they helped tremendously. I have an amazing boss and I was fortunate enough to be able to make that happen.  It actually made me a better and more efficient employee! I, too, work with the public and I did different things depending on my mood.  On days that I felt like rockin' it, I went bald! I put in some nice earrings, a little makeup and rocked it!  On cold days I wore cute hats.  I went hat shopping and got several so I would have one to match my outfit.  There were inexpensive ones at the treatment center so I was able to get a few.  My hair is now coming back, but I still wear the hats 'cause they are so cute!  I also got some wigs to wear and wore them as I felt like it.  My onc's favorite was a blue one I would wear to my infusions - the nurses loved it too!  It was fun to have a blue wig to wear on those days.  I hope you can find what works for you! Take care!! ",

I went back to my breast surgeon and he says it is not an infection and wants me to take anti-inflammatory meds and check back in a week.  Has anyone had this happen to them?",

As to the question regarding when we can say we HAD bc (I love that word, had), a wise friend told me that as soon as I had the surgery that removed the tumors, I was cancer-free.  They cut it out.  In my case, the chemo and radiation are preventative since I had (there's that lovely word again!) a grade 3, Her2 positive tumor (the other tumor was benign).  So I consider myself cancer-free right now!! I had a mammogram between chemo and radiation.  They were able to give me the all-clear right there in the clinic.  I asked the nurse if I could hug her and I began to cry with joy!  She let me hug her and then asked where my support person was... he was in the waiting room and I was overjoyed to share the good news.  Now I just hope to be able to get that good news every 6 months!!",

I'd say something to them about that - you have to be there every day for weeks and you at least deserve the dignity of a changing room.  Banba, do you also not have a changing room? At least you can get the cream on soon after treatment. Rockym, I, too, am feeling more fatigued. I just hold on to the fact that things will slowly get back to normal after we are all done with treatments (right?!?). And I know what you mean about chemopause!  I am waking up in the middle of the night sweating, I even found myself tempted to take off my hat when I was talking to a group of students at work due to a hot flash! I didn't, though, because I dd not want to distract them from what I was saying. I'm going to get some aloe to supplement my calendula - y'all are always a fount of good information!!",

It still hurts to lift my arm and place it in the arm rest during treatment, but as I said, only one more!! Then one more week of work until I have a week of vacation - spring break here I come!!  The thought of this trip is what helped me get through surgery, chemo, radiation...  I hope everyone else gets through quickly and painlessly.  And congratulations to those who are done!!
