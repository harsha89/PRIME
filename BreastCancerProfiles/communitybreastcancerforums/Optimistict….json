My BS & MO reassured me that the cancer is slow-growing & was probably growing over a period of several years before anything became noticeable (mine was found by mammogram, and although 2.7 cm. was not palpable by me or the surgeon). They both concurred that this sort of delay made no difference in the spread of my cancer. On the other hand, don't let them fob you off because of age & breastfeeding. (However, they will probably say having a great-grandmother with breast cancer doesn't increase your risk much, if any.)

Don't let anyone second-guess your treatment decisions. No cancer is exactly alike, just as no woman is exactly like another. Usually, the tumor size is just that - the tumor, not adding the lymph nodes. Often, even when there are cancer cells in the nodes, there is not a measurable tumor there. The staging is based on the size of the tumor & the number of nodes with cancer. Stage IV would include metastases beyond the breast & lymph nodes. About grandchildren: Â  When I was diagnosed, I also feared not living long enough to see any grandchildren. I didn't want to exert any pressure (only one of our three children was married or even in a steady relationship), so only my husband knew this. But about a year later, my son & daughter-in-law let us know they were expecting! They were really cute about telling us - they took us out for dinner to celebrate Mother's Day & gave me a small wrapped gift. I opened it to see a framed picture of the ultrasound! Took me a minute to realize what I was looking at.... Several months later, I cried (real tears, but tears of joy) on that early-morning drive to the hospital to await my first grandchild's birth! Now he is 7 years old, an active (and smart) first-grader, and I also have three granddaughters added to the mix! (I still need to see my youngest son married & starting a family.)",

I was afraid I would break into tears trying to tell them, and didn't want to upset them any more than the facts would. I told my Mom myself by telephone (she lived 7 hours away). Soon after, the shock wore off and I felt better about the diagnosis & became pretty strong emotionally. I was and determined to fight this beast with all I had!

A \"deep\" mass may not always be palpable. I would recommend talking to your doctor -- hopefully one who specializes in breast cancer surgery -- to see if you can at least get a biopsy before the scheduled date. Perhaps a stereotactic biopsy? With a sterotactic biopsy, the imaging will guide the surgeon in placement of the needle for biopsy, especially valuable for a non-palpable mass.",

Macaroni & cheese, scrambled eggs & English muffins with a little butter & jam were the mainstays of my diet. I would make a recipe of mac & cheese (packaged, horrors!), refrigerate the potful, then scoop some out & reheat in microwave when I felt a little hungry.

A good friend drove me to the hospital for my sentinel node mapping & stayed with me for the entire time. For some procedures, the patient shouldn't drive due to the effect of certain medications - and having a friend there while waiting is always a help! My friend also brought meals for several days after my surgery. (Unfortunately, she didn't offer housecleaning or laundry & I didn't ask....but hubby took care of that.) Do ask if she needs help with any errands or shopping, or taking the kids to sports practice or dance class (etc.) if they are at that age. I would say that the #1 thing to AVOID is telling her about the people you know about who had cancer & are fine now (or even worse, NOT fine!) Â I can't count how many times people said that to me! Maybe the ones they knew had stage 0 or stage 1. I was at stage 3, grade 3, triple positive - and just hearing that \"somebody\" is still OK 20 years after cancer, well, that just didn't help me feel positive about the outcome. Make specific offers to help, be a good friend & sounding board, and just \"be there\" for her. You are so kind & compassionate to want to reach out & help her at this time - she is blessed to have a new friend like you.",

Some people actually have a pretty easy time of it - depends a lot on the individual person and also on exactly what chemotherapy agents you will be given. Some people even carry on working their regular jobs & keeping Â up household duties! I worked part-time during chemo, but had very little energy. However, I think some of the newer chemo regimens might be easier (mine was nearly 10 years ago). I also had \"does-dense\" chemo protocol, which means that I had treatment every two weeks instead of three weeks - this is probably more difficult than every three weeks. There are medications to reduce or eliminate nausea - these are often given as an IV alongside the chemo, plus tablets to be used as needed (or IF needed) in the weeks between treatments. So the intractable vomiting shown is movies just isn't current-day reality (if it ever was). And there are treatments for many of the other side effects you might experience. My MO's office told me to call if I had ANY problems (fever, pain, mouth sores, etc.) & at least talk to the call nurse. Usually, they had some medication available to help out. I had NO side effects on Herceptin (weekly treatments for a year).",

      "Content": "Mar 13, 2014 10:48PM - edited Mar 13, 2014 10:58PM by Optimistictraveler I started chemo in Oct. 2004. My MO went to the Breast Cancer Symposium in Dec. 2004 (he goes every year), when reports came out that the stage III trials of Herceptin for adjuvant treatment were stopped because researchers felt results indicated so strongly that Herceptin stopped the cancer in its tracks (my words) - that it would be unethical to withhold Herceptin from those in the control group who were getting placebo. Â Prior to this, Herceptin was only used in cases of metastasic Her2+ BC. (I may be getting this a little wrong, but it's the gist of what he told me.) So, my MO said I would get Herceptin early on - starting at the tail end of Taxol. And my insurance paid for it! While I would be most happy not to have had cancer at all, I'm so glad that it came along at this point in my life, not a few years earlier! I feel that Herceptin is likely what has saved me - I knew several women who were dx'd shortly before I was, and they died within 3-4 years of dx.Â  I have been on Arimidex since about May 2005. No side effects from that, either - just another pill I have to take. My MO & I discussed it, and I will probably continue on it as long as my bone density is still OK when I get the Dexa in June.",

Second surgery took another two weeks, for final staging.Â  My surgeon did not remove all lymph nodes. He performed what is called a \"sentinel node biopsy.\" Dye was injected before surgery, that would show the lymph nodes nearest to the breast during surgery. These sentinel nodes are first in line to any further on, so if they are clear, there is no cancer further up the chain.Those sentinel nodes were examined by the pathologist during surgery & looked OK on first exam. If they are all clear, no further surgery is necessary. But in my case, further examination by the pathologist (after the original quick look during surgery) showed cancer in four out of the five sentinel nodes. So, I had to have a later surgery for my surgeon to remove more lymph nodes further up the chain. I had a total of 21 lymph nodes removed with cancer in 5 of them.Â ",

Â I believe the PET scan is best to show active cancer elsewhere in the body (better than CT) but they don't necessarily do it if lymph nodes are clear. I did have further surgery after that - more lymph node dissection plus a re-incision at the lumpectomy to get wider margins. They found cancer in one more lymph node, but nothing further up the chain. Mind you, all this was almost TEN (10) years ago. I had stage III, grade 3 (aggressive), triple positive Invasive Ductal Carcinoma, 2.7 cm. tumor, with involvement in 5 lymph nodes. And here I am all these years later, NED (No Evidence of Disease).
