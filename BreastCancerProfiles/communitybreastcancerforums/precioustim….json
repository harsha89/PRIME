I could not believe at the Dr.'s office the other day- a girl commented to me after she found out I had a BMX that she would like to lose her large breasts!  I responded \"oh no you don't!\"    She probably said that trying to make me feel better?  Not!  Probably the most challenging part of not having breasts for me is when I give my husband or son a hug I tend to not let them get close to my chest area because of the sensitivity feeling I have there-- or maybe it's a protection thing?  The other day for kicks, I put on a sports bra and stuffed it and tried giving them a hug that way-- and it worked!  Hopefully in time after more of the feeling in my chest comes back-- I will not have this issue:)  Until then-- I am most Thankful to be here today with or without breasts!

I had a 6 month follow up with the surgeon yesterday and he said \"pneumonitis\" -- is probably what I have and that there is really nothing you can do about it -- that it's probably at it's worse right now -- 3 months post Rads.  Since Rads -- I was put on a 4 week regimen of steroids which worked amazingly -- a few weeks after steroids -- I noticed a cough with a lot of mucous and was then put on Albuterol inhaler which seems to help a little. ",
