I originally felt an oval lump that was movable, and not AS smooth as my fibroadenoma, but not super rough or anything either. Anyway, I've been feeling it on and off, and I feel like it's grown a string of tissue, but I'm not positive. I can't tell if they're separate lumps close to the big lump, or just a string of thickened tissue connected to the lump. It's odd. I should also mention that both the fibroadenoma and this new lump are on the same breast: my right now. My left one is smooth and fine. Has anyone had a lump like this? I'm freaking out and I'm only 20 and in college, so it's hard to focus on school when I'm anxious (although I'm learning to manage the anxiety until the ultrasound by remembering the statistics, not to google too much, etc.) Log in to post a reply",

When I touch both, I feel the muscle that's supposed to be there in both except the left feels larger and prominent. It is noticeable when I raise my arms up as well. So, I went to my university's physician and he felt it, examined it, and said it's just the muscle (he said the anatomical name but I can't remember what it was anymore). So months go by, I don't worry about it. Then on that same armpit I started to get itchy out of nowhere and noticed a very light red mark. I thought it was a mosquito bite because it was still warm at the time and my college campus is basically near/in a forest so we get a lot of mosquitos and bugs. However, it's been more or less three weeks and it's still itchy. It's not horrendously red, it's just a light red color and it's super itchy. My mom is a nurse and I sent her pictures and she thinks it's from either shaving or maybe even my deodorant. I have a gyno appointment in about two weeks for a movable lump I found in my right breast and so I'm gonna ask her about the armpit thing. In the mean time I may go to my university doctor to ask him about this rash-like thing and see what he says. I'm just freaking out that it's cancer because my mom was diagnosed in February and then on my father's side my grandma and grand-aunt as well. My gyno knows my history so that's good. I can't tell if I'm being a hypochondriac right now or if I should be concerned. I'm only 20 and Iwant to enjoy my life but I constantly worry about cancer.

My dad's mother and aunt had BC and had mastectomy's 40+ years ago. All three women were past menopausal age, my grandmother had diabetes as well. I saw my gyno in June, explained my history to her including the fact that I have a fibroadenom in my right breast, and I felt better after all the information she gave me regarding BC, my odds, etc. She didn't seem too concerned about me developing it (I can't tell if she was just acting that way so I wouldn't freak out) but this helped with my anxiety for a bit. In early September, I found another lump in my right breast, but instead of being round and easily movable like my fibroadenoma, this lump is oval, kind of difficult to feel at times, movable, and painless. I am freaking the heck out. I waited to see if it would change in size or go away after my period, but it's still there. I called my gyno and I have an appointment October 17, which I know is a little far off (three weeks) but I'm a college student going to school 2hrs from home. I just needed to vent about how scared I am. I'm only 20 and I know that 80% of lumps are benign and that my age plays a good factor, but I'm already panicking and imagining the diagnosis. It didn't help that I stupidly googled \"breast lump in 20 year old\" and an article about a 21 year old girl with BC popped up. Thanks for reading this to whoever does Log in to post a reply",

What you said about the statistics definitely brings comfort, especially knowing that most lumps are actually benign. Something else I try to remember is that my gyno didn't feel anything abnormal, and she didn't seem to appear urgent with getting the sonogram.

Fortunately, the results came back clean, and I will be seeing my surgeon once a year (this year in November) to get a check up, and once I'm 25, I will be having MRI's on my breasts until I am old enough to have mammo's. I'm also waiting on genetic test results. I was wondering if anyone else found it anxiety inducing to do self breast exams after your diagnosis? I know that they are encouraged because it can help with early cancer detection and treatment, but I'm wondering if it's worth it since I will be seeing my breast doctor yearly now. I recently did a BSE on my left side since my right breast is healing, thought I felt a lump at the top left quadrant, and inquired about it during my follow up with my breast doctor. She felt the area and shetold me that breast tissue on the outter part of your breast is generally quite lumpy, and that I'm fine, but if I do feel something before November, to come back and we can talk. My anxiety is so bad I keep wondering if she felt the right area, even though she's the expert and I'm not! Not to mention she is a FANTASTIC doctor and absolutely love her due to her compassion and patience. I was just wondering if anyone else shared this anxiety about BSE Log in to post a reply",

I visited the gyno for the first time last June, where she did a breast exam and didn't feel anything concerning. She did note that I have dense breasts. In the fall of 2016, I thought I felt a new lump in the same breast as the fibroadenoma (my right breast), got a breast sonogram, and was told all they saw was dense breast tissue and nothing else concerning. It's safe to say that I'm definitely a worry wart, especially since my mom was diagnosed with Stage 0 breast cancer a year or so ago. I'm supposed to get my period, and my breasts usually get very tender/heavy/sore before I get it. I know this isn't the right time, but because I felt a rather sharp pain in my right breast, I decided to feel the area. I felt both breasts and I feel as though my right breast is less fatty/smaller/less full than my left. It's hard to explain. I don't wanna say it feels indented but it feels less round or the same as the left. Tbh, I think it may have always been this way but I'm not positive. I'm supposed to go to my gyno for a PAP and was planning to ask her then, but I found out recently that she no longer takes my insurance, so I'm in the process of finding a new one.
