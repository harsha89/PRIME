Does anyone think this merits a 2nd opinion and finally, have any of you specifically chosen a female GP over a male? Mine is male and I'm wondering if that stifled a conversation we should have had about breast health and how scary it feels when they hurt. The grace of God both showed me mercy even though I waited out of fear and ignorance to get my first mammogram. Second, I'm forever grateful of the women on here who showered me with virtual love. I am forever in awe and I will pay it forward...promise.",

I was told when I do my u/s and 2nd mammo today I will have to wait until next week for results. What do you think?",
