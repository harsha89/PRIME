I hope the news remains good for you from now on",

I have a heck of a time sometimes on my bc side.  I had a bilateral mastectomy but the bc side has a lot of scar tissue. I was also radiated half way up my neck because of supraclavicle involvement.  The scar tissue gets exptremely tight and causes issues from my neck to the tip of my fingers. Stretching helps. Any one have similar issues",
