Ever since then, it doesn't take much to make me worried.  Just thought I'd explain so my overreacting is more understandable.  You have all been so helpful, I hope it is okay if I ask another question.  After the sonographer spoke with the radiologist, she said I could leave and to follow-up with my physician who should be receiving a report in a week.  This made me a little nervous as I wondered if this meant something was still unresolved.  She said nothing was wrong or the radiologist would not be letting me go home.  I'm wondering if it's standard protocal to tell people to follow up with their physician?  I'm asking because if the results letter they send tells me this, I want to know if it's routine or if I should be worried because they are telling me to follow-up. She also indicated he didn't specifically mention my needing to come back in six months, but I'm wondering if the letter is apt to say this since I needed extra imaging.  Just wondering what is the normal thing to expect in the letter after this type of call back with sonogram.  I am relieved they sent me home, but somehow the stress of this experience two years in a row has left me feeling afraid it isn't over.  Have any of you felt this way after frequent call backs?  Thank you so much.",
