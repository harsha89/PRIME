Also to give an update on my status, in case there's anyone else on the same boat, or this helps anyone in the future. I opted for the bilateral mastectomy with recon, and I'm now 2+ weeks out of surgery. Happy to report, I feel pretty good :) Worst part had to be the drains for a week, but recovery wasn't half bad from there. When I made the decision to do BMX (not radiation), I asked my doctor for an MRI of my breasts to confirm I could do the nipple-sparing procedure without concern of retaining any cancerous cells near the aureola. Thankfully, the MRI came back clear. They also didn't see anything suspicious that might require lymph node removal, so I didn't have that done either. Glad I asked about the MRI-- it definitely was a huge relief for my peace of mind. Final pathology after BMX surgery also came back clear, phew. In any case, getting my 2nd expanding tomorrow which hasn't been the most fun experience, but I'll take it. I'm sure I will be asking many paranoid crazy questions about that stuff in the near future, haha. Thanks again sisters for the insight. This forum has been an amazing resource. ",

      "Content": "yougogirls wrote: Hi everyone- I am so inspired by all of the discussions on this board. I've been reading topics here and there since the day they found a suspicious area on my mammogram, one month ago. What strong women you are and what hope and strength you give off! I was diagnosed with DCIS (estrogen positive, stage 2) two days ago, at 33. The area is about 1.5 cm. My doctor has given me two treatment options: (1) Additional lumpectomy to clear one margin and then radiation for 4 weeks followed by Tamoxifen, or (2) mastectomy. Yesterday I went in for genetic testing and am awaiting results which might inform my decision, though my gut feeling is to go with a bilateral mastectomy for future peace of mind. I have no children but hope to have them in the upcoming couple years. I was wondering if there are any women reading this who are/were in a similar age and situation? My doctor has referred to me being an \"outlier\" (my mom was BRCA negative), and the articles I've read which are largely based on the 50+ age group. I feel like I am in a no-man's land in a way. I am most concerned with curbing recurrence, and mastectomy seems to decrease the % chance of recurrence a little more than radiation for someone my age group (if only slightly). My concerns with radiation are fertility and Tamoxifen for 5 years. I am scared the radiation will have a long term effect on my body and perhaps a future child. The idea of taking Tamoxifen for the next 5 years also feels like an ask for me to plan around this disease -- which I do not want to to. I've had my cries and am ready to kick this thing in the ass already! In any case, for those reasons I am leaning toward bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction, but also I realize that may be considered \"drastic\" for someone my age. Would love input/insight from anyone. :)on why you chose one treatment option over the other. Thank you! Log in to post a reply",

I've sent a request to join the Facebook group, JVP and Sophie. Thank you for that. I'm still waiting to hear back from genetics. I'm hoping the results will help me find peace in my decision. Nursepatient and Datny- I am in similar thought as you. The thought of radiation and 5 years of drugs seems like a big ask at this age, especially when I have children on mind in the upcoming few years. I'm meeting with a radiologist next week and will have many questions regarding fertility as well as impact on fetus. I know I need to take care of myself first and foremost but the sacrifice of my breasts doesn't seem daunting, if it means radiation/drugs won't have a chance of effecting my future. Since we had similar sized cases (mind was 2 cm above my nipple), can I ask you if you were worried about clean margins from breast removal? I think my worst nightmare is unclear margins after surgery and then having to do the radiation, as JVP mentioned. I wish there was a way to determine this early. Did anyone ask for an MRI before making their decision? My doctor said she wouldn't recommend it prior to my diagnosis b/c young tissue is dense and we would find many suspect things. But at this point, more clarity seems like a good idea.",
