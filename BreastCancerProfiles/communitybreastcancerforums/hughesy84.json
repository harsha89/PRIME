Tiny 1.2mm drop found in one lymph node which my consultant wasn't concerned about at all. The tumour was 5mm with DCIS around it. The tumour was sent for an oncotype test. I scored a 7 but for some reason I didn't celebrate that score. I had a sneaky feeling something else was wrong. Unfortunately after the two lumpectomies the margins weren't clean. DCIS remained behind (or pre-cancer as my consultant calls it?). Mastectomy was the option on just that breast with immediate reconstruction. I had an MRI last week. Before my mastectomy today (I am typing this from my Hospital bed) my consultant came in and gave me my MRI results. Another 12mm tumour was found in the same breast. I asked her if this would affect my oncotype score and she said no but how can she know? Results of mastectomy all come back Thursday. I am just wondering if it's common to find a second tumour in the same breast and what are the chances the grade/stage will be different to other tumour Log in to post a reply",
