What was discovered is that there was a huge discrepancy between the Oncotype test and the early pathology reports I received post biopsy but pre surgery.  The major discrepancy was that the HER2+ FISH diagnosis in the pre surgery report was found by the Oncotype test to be just barely within the \"equivocal\" range and within the range of error.  The ER number was also much higher on the Oncotype. I had a lumpectomy and APBI (partial breast irradiation) and will be treated with Tamoxifen due to possible cardiac SEs with the AIs. Previous oncology suggestions for treatment were TCH based on the early report. My Oncotype score is 26, mid-range intermediate risk.  If I were younger and had young children I would choose the chemo path. As it is, I chose quality of life. After the scare of the early report, a 17% recurrence rate which is not much different than the rate with chemo  is, at my age \"doable\". My oncologist said that he thinks the Oncotype test is more accurate due to it being done at the molecular level and recommends it for all his ER+ patients. I am highly disappointed with the pathology report by the local lab.  Many ladies say their FISH test was not done locally, but mine was.",

Treatment time is reduced to just five days instead of over six weeks.

In my case and maybe yours as well my BS was sure he got everything, and the Onc. agreed, so in there opinion the Oncotype test ws wrong for me. Who know if they are right or not, we jsut have to go with who we trust. I had problems finding an oncologist that I trusted and refused chemo, and when I found someone I liked, although I had had a lumpectomy and the five-day radiation treatment, this doctor wanted an OncotypeDX test on my tumor. I am so thankful that he ordered the test. My original pathology had my tumor at HER2 positive, and I was trying to find someone who would prescribe Herceptin without chemo.  The Oncotype test showed that not only were the ER results incorrect in the original lab report, the Oncotype showed that instead of HER2 + I was just barely on the low end of HER2 equivocal!  I know this is something that happens very infrequently, but I thank God it happened for me. He not only ordered the test, but his office contacted the Oncotype people and arranged that if my insurance refused payment, they would do it for free.  My OncotypeDX score was 26,  in the high intermediate range, but I'm 71, and my age was a big factor in the chemo decision. My onc said that since the Oncotype test was on the actual DNA and not some lab tech counting spots under a microscope, the Oncotype was in his opinion the more accurate and he believes EVERY tumor should be tested via the DNA. I am on Tamoxifen, which he said in his 35 years of practice he has had good results with.  In February, he pronounced me NED.  I will see him again in May. As you say, Kira..\"we just have to go with who we trust.\"  I was uneasy with my lab results because the test from the biopsy was equivocal, but the FISH test after surgery was positive...and the same lab did both tests.",

The surgeon only had to take one lymph node for biopsy and it was cancer-free in the preliminary inspection. I'm hopingl to avoid the SEs from node removal.  I won't know if the margins around the tumor are clean until the path results come back. I only had to take two pain pills after surgery and this morning I have a minor sore throat due to the appliance they put in my mouth to keep my tongue from obstructing my airway due to the anesthesia. Otherwise I am hardly sore around the incision and moving my arm freely. Perhaps there will be more soreness later, but I feel good today. I think the lack of soreness may be because the tumor was (how great to say WAS) small and close to the edge of the breast.  There is a little tenderness in my armpit from the node removal but not much. That said, the isotope injection was about as has been described on the forum. They didn't/wouldn't use lidocaine, only the \"numbing\" (yeah right!) cream and all four injections burned pretty badly. I complained to the BS and she said, \"Oh yeah, that hurts\". !! That said I like the BS, she actually put the guide wires in herself AFTER I was  anesthesized and she has a good rep. If you are in Phoenix, it's Dr. Lise Walker. The folks at the outpatient center had lots of good comments about her, too.",

Of course, look at the side effects, but since these PPI's have gone from RX only to OTC, they likely have a good record or their manufacturers would be sued into oblivion.
