The daughter lives in another state and can not attend the appointments. I do face time her while we are at the doctors and I cringe at the ideas that she is proposing. But again, I am trying my best to be objective and supportive. I have no doubt that some alternative treatments have \"cured\" people but I am stuck in the middle of a woman who is overwhelmed and a daughter who wants what is best for her mother, without hearing what her mother is telling her what she wants. I will look for existing research findings with outcomes. That is a great idea. Thank you for the recommended treatment sheet. It looks very helpful. I guess from time of discovery to treatment is a short time frame. Thanks You for letting me know your situation Curlyq1974. As I said, everything could change if the PET Scan reveals that it has spread. Thanks again! ",

My mom has passed, and I help her friend out with errands and medical appointments) just diagnosed. I will do my best to relay the information as correct as possible. I am looking for ideas, suggestions and validation. A Lump was detected, and all of the tests were done. The initial report: Tumor about 3.5 cm in size. 90 % Estrogen and 90 % progesterone positive, 0 % Her+. The lymph node biopsy was inconclusive. A lumpectomy and Lymph nodes were removed. Pathology report stated that the tumor was 5.5 cm in size and that the lymph nodes were matted, but that a 3.3 cm cancerous tumor was found in the armpit lymph node. The surgeon stated that if the original pathology report indicated extensive lymph node involvement then she would have removed more lymph node during the surgery, but due to my friend being 75 years old and in fair health (multiple medical issues) that she only removed what was necessary. We met with the Oncologist yesterday. Chemo, radiation and hormone therapy are indicated. They are staging the cancer at 3 a or b. We were told that it does not matter if it is a or b, because the treatment protocols are the same. As to which type of chemo will be done is up to my friend. Her choices are a low dose of Taxol, 1 treatment every week for 12 weeks or Intermediate dose of Taxotere and Cytoxan, 1 dose every 3 weeks for 12 weeks. My friend is undergoing a PET scan today to determine if the cancer has spread. The oncologist stated that they can start treatment in 10 days. The questions and concerns that I have are: 1. From the beginning it has been a fast process: Found, tests, removal, start chemo all within a months time. Is this normal? It just seems so rushed and overwhelming. 2. Which Chemo do you feel is best for her? I understand that it is her choice. If it were me I would do T and C. 3. My friend's daughter is somewhat against chemo and radiation and would like to use food and marijuana oil as a treatment. My friend's doctors do not feel that with this type of aggressive cancer that it would be wise. My friend is so quiet and her daughter is bullying her slightly with the idea of this treatment. 4. Should my friend get a second opinion? My friend is concerned that now she has been told that her cancer is aggressive, that any delay in treatment would cause the cancer to spread more. I encouraged her to wait until the PET scan report is done to decide her next step. Any insight would be helpful. My best friend won her battle with breast cancer 2 years ago, but she was stage 1.

They did find a lump in her armpit along with the breast. She did have a biopsy but it was inconclusive. She did have a bone density scan but I believe it was because they thought that she would be doing hormone therapy right after the surgery. The doctor's made no mention on the type of cancer. But, I will bring that up at the next appointment. This makes me uneasy. She had a lumpectomy not a mastectomy. She had the procedure done on 3/1. The surgeon examined her yesterday and said that she was healing well. You have touched on what I am feeling that it has been SO RUSHED that I do not feel real conversation regarding treatment are being had. It is terrible for me to say but they are a breast cancer treatment center and I only feel like she is being treated like cattle. It has been so emotional. We leave the doctor's feeling relief that she is being treated then I feel like we were rushed and not given any supportive care. We brought up nutrition and were given a sheet of foods to avoid and told to eat fresh fruits and vegetables after washing them with dish soap. A part of me wonders if her daughter's forceful nature, concern and desire to treat alternatively is causing the doctor to rush to treatment. Thanks you Kicks! I understand now that there is not dilly dallying when it comes to locating a lump in the breast. But, that there has not been enough talk and understanding of what is going on her care. They did give us handouts, which are helpful when trying to process all of this information. Thank you again.",
