I saw a radiation oncologist, and my assistant oncologist, we gave some creams-( it has been a week and it isn't better)- said to come back in a week if not better)- I definitely will, and I am going to see a dermatologist too- I asked about inflammatory breast disease-- they say no- but I am very very scared- I guess the first thing is to have the punch biopsy- and then we will see- I have been on tamoxifen for 2 yrs now.. Well I know that worry can't change things- but it is so hard not too. What a time of year w/ xmas and the new year. Can't stop feeling sorry for myself and really down. Log in to post a reply",
