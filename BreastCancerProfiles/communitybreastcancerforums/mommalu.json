It was called skin saving/sparring  for a delayed reconstruction I told them to take everything, nipples and all. But I know  have pain in my nipples even though i don't have any. i was also told the pain is a good sign that i am healing and the nerves are getting feeling back. I have nothing to compare it to but my insides hurt/ache where the tissue has been scrapped/carved out. My breast surg told me to just keep massaging the tissue but it is painful.",
