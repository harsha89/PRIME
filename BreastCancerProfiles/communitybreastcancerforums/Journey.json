Just last weekend I went to another social event and was able to wear pretty much my normal clothes except I had to hide my sports bra (fashion tape is great).  Hope that helps a little!  Good luck on you surgery!",

December 11, 2012 I am getting desperate to find a good seamless shirt with a lower neckline and no logo on top. I've bought everything I can find in hopes it would do the trick. The best I have found is Underarmour but sadly because of the high neckline and or the logo placement I can't hide it under normal street clothes. I also wish the short sleeve versions had just a little longer sleeve so I don't have that gap of upper arm bulge between my compression sleeve and the bottom of the shirt sleeve. On bad days I must wear them inside out because of the seaming irritation so seamless would be a dream. My issue is my upper back near the arm pit so camis and tank are out for me because they cut into that area and make it worse. I have to find a compression top with some sleeve to it. I even took one of my UA shirts to my tailor to see if he could do anything to lower the neckline and he said it can't be done. December 12, 2012 Ladies we have tried to get UA attention before but to my knowledge nothing has come from it. See my topic \"New Type of LE garment\" then go to page 7. This was back in January 2012. We got all excited that they seemed to be interested but like I said I don't think anything came from it. Although we are a fierce group - we are a small number when you look at the mass population. I just don't think they will be swayed. We may need to start talking to smaller manufacturers, but then we get into a very expensive garment that many of us can't afford or can't afford the number of them that we need in a year. December 18, 2012 I had forgotten that I bought a Ahh Seamless T-shirt by Rhonda Shear (HSN.com) this summer. It's stuck in my closet someplace and I need to dig it back out. The design is kind of what many of us are looking for. I think the compression was decent but gentle and the sleeves are a good longer short sleeve style. But I had issues with it being too thick material (HOT) and the seam work at the shoulders was not done well as it puckers. As I was driving into work it hit me that she might be a good one to reach out too. I jumped on the HSN website today during lunch and sure enough she has a blog there and looks like she actually reads posts and replies from time to time. Soooo I posted a little thing about BC and lymphedema and our needs for a good tshirt design. I'll keep you posted and let you know how you can help.",

Hate to encourage anyone to spend yet more money while we wait for our holy grail but if you are desperate like I am you may want to check it out.  www.skinnytees.com Again this is NOT a full compression shirt...just gentle hug kind of thing.  I was surprised this little bit helped me like it did.  I'm happy to try and answer questions about my experience.",

The right amount of compression (ie UA brand type), unobtrusive neckline sans logo so we can wear under our normal clothes, flat seams to avoid chaffing, and a choice of sleeves - short, long. Isn't that basically it? Oh, and affordable so we can buy several and replace as needed. Nude would be an awesome color choice as well as black and white. Please no pink. Ladies?",

The Sassybox sleeves are way too tight and would cause a bad problem for me so back it went. I too have tried the Tommy Cooper but in the T-shirt and although I kept it it does not give any real compression so it's just a gym shirt for me. I will share that I have had some success with the SkinnyTees line. Currently I am using their \"sports\" bra, camis and cap sleeve shirts. They are not cheap (but affordable), and it only comes in one size. For me with my size arms, chest, back, etc it give me a nice gentle compression. If you are much smaller it may not work for you. Anyway, it looks nice and feels great for my needs - unless I am full blown and then I pull out the stronger stuff. JMO. Fingers crossed on the next GO offering!",

Researchers use animals and samples from a \"tissue bank\" because they don't have ready access to healthy women. But what we learn from animals doesn't always translate into how cancer develops in women, and tissue only from women with cancer may not help solve the puzzle of what caused the cancer. The Army of Women will allow researchers to conduct a wider array of studies and to solve the puzzle as to how breast cancer starts and how to stop it in women!\" I'm glad to see something like this starting to become a reality.  Let's find a cause and then maybe we can get a cure.",

It's gosh awful looking and long but really helped me keep the LE out of my back which is were it really started for me after my 3rd surgery.  I got two of them from my PT and my insurance paid for both so you may start there.

Hi Estepp - I hope you are not asking because you think you may have it? For me the swelling was not visible except to a trained eye.  A LE PT will be able to take measurements (if in the arms, hands), and can tell better.  Mine started as a feeling of fullness in my back near my armpit that didn't go away after surgery swelling subsided.  Then I became aware of a real tenderness and the feeling of pin pricks all day long in the underneath fleshy part of my upper arm.  On a bad day it hurts when someone just pats me on the shoulder or arm (we tend to do that a lot here in the South!)",

She has taught me and my husband how to do the massage, but said I don't need to wrap at night. My insurance will only allow 15 visits a year so I am being kind of stingy in when I go.  Last calendar year I did go 2x a week for 2 weeks but then I had the exchange surgery.  Went 2 x last month.  If anything I think I am worse now. To begin with I had the pins and needles pain in the arm and fullness feeling in my back.  Now my arm feels full and heavy and occasionally I feel actual twinges of pain. I guess I need to start doing self massage everyday instead of waiting for DH to do it 3 times or so a week.  So is it possible to get better? I know I am at danger in both arms and do take care.  Only have sleeve and gauntlet for right.  Have the bras that I don't wear except sometimes at night. I have not been taught how to wrap so guess I need to look into that. I think until now I have really been in a form of denial over the LE.  I don't want this and don't want to take the time to deal with it.  How should I go about my day with LE?  Wake up and clear the nodes in the shower, pull on sleeve / glove, take deap breaths during the day, get some form of excercise, remove sleeve 1 hour afterwards, do massage, then wrap before bed?  Is that basically what I should be doing?",

I know that if any bc is found in the path report on the left then there will be no question about coverage.  Oh, I will also have expanders at the same time.  Anybody been down this path before and can share some information I would appreciate it very much!

Leaf - I am sorry I don't know the technical name (all my pamphlets are in my car right now) but what the radiologist said is the type when they insert the wire for the surgeon to follow.  However my doc said that the surgeon may do a different type and I will know more when I meet with him on 8/4. My breasts are a wannabe B and I don't carry a lot of weight on my upper torso.  Think what has me a little freaked is that area towards the back.  They had a heck of a time trying to get it positioned right in the compression plates to get a good look at it.  So it is near muscle I fear. What I have are two areas of microcalcifications. Not sure from the report how clustered they are. Thanks for the input!",

I already have the answer from the breast surgeon so I will speak with the plastic surgeons office today and see what they say.  Thanks!",
