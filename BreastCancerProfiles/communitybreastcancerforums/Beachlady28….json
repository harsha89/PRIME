Had a malignant Stage 1 Grade 2 cancer on the right so had the surgery last Sept., rads and am on anastrozole. They are watching a \"Birad 3 complicated cyst\" on the left. To ease my mind can I request/suggest/demand a biopsy of the cyst? The protocol is 6 month rechecks which will bring me to Feb. Don't know if I can stand the worry and anxiety till then. Research tells me that excess worry makes cortisol which makes inflammation which can cause diseases like cancer. Wouldn't you think that with my past history that a biopsy should be done on the cyst? Maybe it is a Stage 0 now and will be worse in another 6 months? And my breast are also dense which makes mammograms harder to read. Anyone else have this dilemma? Any comments or thoughts are much appreciated. Thank you all and have a good evening!",

Here is my question: I am 4 weeks post surgery for lumpectomy and sentinel node removal.  I am still very sore although it seems to be just a bit less each day.  I still get the stabbing pains for which I take Tylenol and use a warm compress.  It is particularly irritating where the underarm incision is because the seams of shirts rub there and the bra rides up I that area at times.  The area is very sensitive and bending over particularly is bothersome.  Here are my questions: When does it stop hurting?  And how am I to start radiation on this very sore area when I read about burns, skin peeling, blisters and oozing?  Sounds to me like more pain will be layered on top of existing pain and I will not be able to handle it.   Anyone have this problem and how to solve it? Thanks a bunch!",
