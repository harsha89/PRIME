You are going to need a biopsy\" He was an older gentleman who went over my images with me and explained to me what he was seeing. It was more than a month before I had my surgery. I had to go for many tests such as an Ultrasound guided biopsy, an MRI and a PET, Probably a CT scan was in there too. I also visited my internist, an oncologist, a radiologist, and two surgeons before my surgery. I was glad I did because I felt I had a really good plan of attack and felt comfortable with my team when I went into surgery. I felt like they studied my situation well and addressed all of my concerns. I also learned appointment will be made, cancelled, and rescheduled. It drove me a little crazy but I got through it. ",

Sometimes the cells can flick off from the tumor when it was removed during surgery. I would opt for the radiation. I had savi radiation which is a 5 day targeted radiation treatment. It required, however, a device to be implanted in the breast. My side effects were very minimal. I would get more information out of the doctor regarding the type of breast cancer it is and what are her chances of recurrence. They can perform further tests on the tumor without disturbing your mother. If the cancer is a hormone receptive positive cancer, they will recommend hormone suppression treatment. Some of side effects are hot flashes, joint pain if taking Femara or Anastrozole I found Tamoxifen to have less side effects which is hot flashes. If your mother is HER2+, they will recommend herceptin. If they recommend herceptin you will have to discuss the pro and cons of her taking it given her medical condition.",

Nodes are clear.  My incisions are healing nicely but I am still sore and swollen.  The doctor want me to start the \"walk the wall\" exercise.  I was able to do it without a problem.  The Oncologist still wants an Onco score because of my age; but otherwise it looks like I won't need chemo and will be eligiable for the SAVI .  In two weeks I will start my radiation (SAVI method). ",

During the first six months after surgery and radiation, I experienced chills and a stroking sensation.  I was told that was my nerves healing.  I no longer experience that kind of discomfort.",
