My diagnosis is new too, & like you breast cancer was something that never entered my mind, it always happened to other people. I am 36 too, I never found a lump, my wonderful family doctor sent me for a baseline mammogram when I went for a yearly physical. After a 2nd mammogram & biopsy l was diagnosed with DCIS largest 7cm mass but so many areas on the film, fanning out from behind my nipple all the way to chest wall. My breast surgeon, who I saw for the 1st time this week, described it as profuse. Due to my size, she said a lumpectomy would leave little breast tissue, even if I did get clear margins. She advised a bilateral mastectomy. I am ER+, but due to a history of blood clots wouldn't be able to take tamoxifen. I see a plastic surgeon this week. I have had many injuries, broken bones, cuts, sports injuries - but nothing compares to this. The shock is so over whelming & numbing, functioning is difficult. I have 3 children, 9, 7 & 18 months. My babies. Your precious little one, 7 months old, I love being a Mum (I'm English!).They truly keep me going, without them I would be an empty shell. I have to get through this, & we have to believe we will get through this. I was diagnosed July 13th, & this has without doubt been the most horrific 2 weeks. But I came here last week, & the support & friendship extended to me from all parts of the country has been SO helpful. So many wonderful ladies who care. I wish I could hug you all.",
