You might set up a lotsahelpinghands.com calendar for her. My friends did this for me, for meals, for rides for my kids ... you can also add other things, like errands, gardening, house cleaning, etc. Knowing that my kids would be fed and that they could go to school/sports made a HUGE difference for me. I actually had a pretty serious goodbye to my breasts ceremony with my mom, adopted neighborhood mom, bff and a very spiritual native American friend who led the ceremony. That's not what you're going to do, of course, but it helped me a lot. With others humor was great. Some faculty made prayer flags with images, words, etc. that now circle my dining room. You could have everyone contribute something to a basket that you can give to her that night or when she's at the hospital/home from hospital -- with drawings, notes, movies, magazines, a lap desk (my favorite present), tea, snacks, etc. We're all lucky to have people like you in our lives, Maggie",
