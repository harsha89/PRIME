I thought I had written that my Personal Dr told me DCIS but when I got to the surgeon it was NOT DCIS but Invasive Ductal Carcinoma with DCIS. That report was sent to my doctor and isn't showing up in my records for some reason. Will try to edit my original post if I can from my iPhone without too much difficulty!",

      "Content": "HausFrauMi wrote: Hello, I had my normal routine screening mammo in November. I have been having them since I was 18. I am now 42. I missed the past 2-3 years while we were living in Germany and to be honest didn't feel like navigating the language barriers and getting one done while we were there. I was told they needed a repeat/follow up. Went right after Thanksgiving Break...required an ultrasound at the appointment. I saw the \"suspicious\" spot on the monitor. Met with the Nurse afterwards and even then they felt it was probably just a spot from getting older and shouldn't worry too much. Decided that I would wait for biopsy til January with the school holidays and my Deductible to start over. Monday Jan 11 I had the needle biopsy and clip placed in my right breast. I cannot feel the lump at all it is pretty deep and I have dense breasts. My primary doctor called at 9:30 Wednesday morning to tell me it came back positive for cancer but I thought she told me it was \"just\" DCIS so wasn't as worried. She immediately got me with a surgeon at Noon. *at the surgeon's office the NP told me that it was not DCIS but Invasive Ductal Carcinoma. They sent me for Chest xray, lymph node ultra sound, and metabolic panel. The lymph node scan was clear but of course there is always the microscopic stuff that could have migrated.... My mom died from breast cancer in 1989 (she was 38) and had the lump for a while before she was diagnosed at age 35. Genetic counseling appt is on Tuesday. It will take 2-3 weeks for results. There is no other cancer in our family for the most part or very removed/much older (70+ age) relatives. My cousin that is a Doctor says to have a double mastectomy and ovaries removed regardless of genetic testing outcome. My children are 7&9. I feel like a lumpectomy and treatment (radiation/chemo) would be the easiest with them being so much younger. However, if it came back then I would go full steam ahead with my cousins recommendation. 2nd opinions? How do you determine which surgeon is better at lumpectomy vs mastectomy? I live in the Metro Detroit area. (Troy Beaumont hospital) When my doctor called Wednesday morning I didn't know whether to laugh or cry so I kinda did both! I have been expecting this diagnosis to appear at some point since my mom died when I was 15 yrs old. I feel sorta dumbfounded. I'm not mad or angry. I know right before any surgery I choose is when I will get scared. I know what the recovery is like after major surgery. I have had RNY Gastric Bypass and a hysterectomy but he left my damn ovaries!!! He said I should go thru normal menopause because I was only 39. Removing the ovaries or taking tamoxifen etc..will give me the same results from my understanding. Appreciate any resources for finding a great surgeon. The one I saw may be just fine but I am clueless. We only moved here in August and do not know many people. Thanks for any help!

I guess I was under the impression that the ovary/Meds just put you into menopause to rid estrogen from your system. I didn't really look into further details. I think I am peri-menopausal. Ask about my mood swings. Hormones have been outta whack all my life. Surprisingly had no issues getting pregnant both times in my 30's. Going to enjoy our last trip for the near future this weekend I think we are cancelling spring break. Kids are super excited to see tons of snow this weekend Up North in Michigan. Had planned to sip wine all weekend but now I read that its cancer feeding. I can't win!!! :   ",
