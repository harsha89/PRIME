I am trying to find out all the info I can on what causes this. I had an ultrasound which showed nothing. I had had a mammogram 2 months before finding the dimple, and elected to not repeat it because they are very painful for me. I've had this skin tethering or dimple for 3 months now and keep telling myself it must be nothing but I'm still worried. It feels like something is pulling deep in my breast. Should I get more testing? FYI, I am 54 years old, my mother and grandmother both died from breast cancer, and my mother's youngest sister is a breast cancer survivor. I have had one biopsy on left breast that turned out to be a fibroid when I was in my  mid 30's.",

But with the heavy family history, I agree with you; there must be some genetic component they haven't figured out yet. My MRI showed that the cancer is confined to the breast. But it's bigger than originally thought. over an inch (2.9CM) not a little over a half inch. 2 satellite lesions were also found making a lumpectomy harder to do. I see a plastic surgeon next week to talk about reconstruction possibilities. And there was apparently a malfunction that made my other breast light up like a Christmas tree, but they are assuming it's just the malfunction. I'm gonna try to get the MRI redone at no cost to me since it's their machine's screwup. Wish me luck! PS, How did your radiation treatment go? Any side effects? Shirley",
