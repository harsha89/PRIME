Although I\u2019m not sure if that would be much help or not, I\u2019m hoping. I do know that a google search for symptoms is one sure way to make yourself believe your dying. So I try to be very impartial. Google only things that I knownit could be example:cyst symptoms etc I\u2019ve come across a few things that have given me some piece of mind. I typically don\u2019t get too worried. I\u2019ve had a heart condition that took over a year to diagnose and treat. And I never once becane as worried as I am right now. I run my own business, I have a two year old I bring with me to the store everyday . Even if it did turn out to be the bad thing I\u2019m worried about, I know my chances would be good to beat it. My fear is, I don\u2019t have time to be sick, I\u2019ve got a baby to tend, a household to run, and a business to work 70 hours a week at and I\u2019ve just got such a bad feeling that this is something bad. I know positive thoughts, positive vibes, and what you put out into this world is what you get back. But I\u2019m just worried, and wish my dang phone would finally ring for that app.  I thank you for your well wishes, and for your advice! I think maybe creating a valentines day craft is in order with the little to clear my mind ☺️ ",

Father\u2019s mother diagnosed in her 30s Mothers side great and great great grandmothers diagnosed later in life. About 2 weeks ago my left breast became sore, not intensely sore. But noticeably sore, especially if leaned on. I am half way through my cycle, finished period about two weeks ago and have two weeks to go until it starts so it\u2019s not period related, I\u2019ve also never had a mass or lump due to my cycle (or any other reason) After a few days I felt around, and found what feels like a 1 1/2 to 2 inch long mass It is longer then wide, feels like it is misshaped, feels as if it has longer piece coming from back of it, below nipple and off to side towards arm pit. It is fairly hard, and feels attached to the chest wall. It also feels as if it has changed in size since I originally found it It hurts a bit to push on, sometimes I will get a stabbing like pain in the area. My armpit has been sore or itchy on and off. My shoulder blade has had pain on and off. I\u2019ve been with a sore throat on and off (which may or may not be related) Just yesterday I felt it again (I keep checking for changes) and I had a very small amount of nipple discharge. I went to doctor 6 days ago, she seemed a bit concerned. Said it made her feel better that it wasn\u2019t completly solid like a rock, but booked an ultra sound on rush (which I have not heard from yet) And sent me for blood work that same day, which I have not heard from yet Would the blood work be able to tell her that it is probably infection/fine/benign etc Or if my red or white blood cells are off? Or am I just waiting to hear from blood work for nothing, and should be focused more on the ultra sound? About a year ago my armpits started sweating profusely while at rest, dripping down my arm. The doctor believes it could be a thyroid issue causing the sweating. So could the sweating cause an infection. And could an infection cause a mass, tenderness, tired, back pain, sore throat, and even now one side of my jaw started hurting (although that could be clenched jaw from stress) Today I woke up with terrible lower back pain, I feel like a hot mess that is falling apart. I hate the waiting, I didn\u2019t think to ask enough questions at my doctors app. And I figured I would have heard back from blood work and for my app for ultra sound by now. I just want to know if it\u2019s nothing major and I can treat it and move on, or if I actually have a reason for this anxiety and start dealing with it. Any advice, opinions, or kind words would be greatly appreciated <3 Log in to post a reply",

I believe the doctor also felt the same way I\u2019m in Canada so we don\u2019t have the options like in other countries. Waiting seems to be the Canadian way. The ultra sound will be at the local hospital, and I believe I basically have to wait that out (but she did put a rush on it) she said with my age, family history, and her findings she wants to know what it is ASAP. She also didn\u2019t offer any educated guesses (which worries me a bit) I was hoping she would say something like \u201cit feels similar to a cyst, or between how it feels and what your symptoms are I\u2019m guessing breast fibroids\u201d but she offered nothing and just told me we would find out what is going on as soon as possible  I did however, call her office today to ask about blood work results. The receptionist took notes and is requesting her to call me ether tomorrow or the day after.  I know statistically speaking, my chances are very good it is something very minor! But no matter what I look up or who I speak to that has had a breast cyst etc, it doesn\u2019t seem to match anything. The symptoms don\u2019t seem to line up I plan to let her know about the small amount of discharge when I speak to her as well! I\u2019m hoping that\u2019s a good sign that it is infection or something else similar. Waiting sucks.....",

Which an infection in your body could make you feel achy, run down, etc I feel the lump itself is what\u2019s causing the shoulder blade/shoulder/arm pit and even upper arm pain. If it\u2019s pushing on things, surely it could cause those issues. I have lower back issues to begin with, but this feels more like an achy pain. I believe the jaw and back are probably stress related, but wanted to add any new things in my world that may point to something like infection etc",
