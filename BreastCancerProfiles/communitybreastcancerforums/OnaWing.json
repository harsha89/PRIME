That's one more thing to check off the list and one step closer to recovery. I knew I would be groggy from the anesthesia and took advantage of it to catch up on my sleep as I haven't slept too well recently. Traveling to Tampa tomorrow for second opinions at Moffitt as I want to be sure my local oncologist is choosing the same regimen that would be selected if I were in the clinic. Thought second opinions were important because my BC is a rather rare micro papillary invasive ductal carcinoma with positive mammary and axillary nodes. My local oncologist has not treated a micro papillary and I'm hoping a larger clinic such as Moffitt will have more experience with this type. Anyone on this Board have or know of it?  Since Tampa is home, I will see my sister. Time with her always feels good when I'm down mostly because we talk about all kind of foolish things except why I am down. Can't wait for that.     ",

You see, I've lurked with my unspoken pain and fears, afraid that speaking of them would be too discouraging for women who are fighting a good fight. I'm not yet ready to be grateful for this disease but I am aware that good can come from all things and I search continuously to find the message of good. For now, breast cancer has stolen my body, my spirit, my security and my mind and I'm fighting to get back what is mine. That said, I'm sadly aware that things will never be the same again and am grieving the loss of the life I had and loved even while I pray for long term survival and try to figure out what replaces my old life. Working through the physical, emotional and mental implications of cancer is so much more difficult when your body and brain are being assaulted regularly by toxic chemicals. It's an emotional roller coaster ride. You are obviously a fighter and a survivor. I recall from previous posts that you choose your weapons carefully, confront things head-on and wage a grand battle. Thank you for setting that example and for having the courage to talk about it openly. I hope you will be happy to know that others have been helped by your candor. Following your example, I decided to stop denying that this disease has inflicted extreme emotional damage and scheduled time with a psycho therapist. It's tough too, confronting your fears can be quite painful but I expect the rewards will be great. Again, thank you!",

After uneventful early treatments, side effects from the last TX were bad. Severe cramping from days 3-9, a full cover of mouth sores extended all the way down my throat, muscle aches, and I developed hand/foot syndrome with chemical burns inside my hands and fingers. Since I changed nothing about home care; kept up the water; healthy, high protein food choices with fruits and vegetables; Claritin for Neulasta pain, etc., I'm trying to figure out what happened and head it off this time. The only thing that was different was the amount of fluids administered during the infusion. My pump kept alarming so the oncology nurse channeled the drugs through the working side of the pump and discontinued the fluid drip, only using the fluids to flush my port. When my infusion was complete, I'd only received 1/10 of the fluids but the nurse said it was okay because the fluids were only used for flushing anyway. Now I'm wondering if that wasn't part of the problem and am thinking of asking the doctor to order a full bag of fluids. Has anybody else had this come up, or have an opinion about the role of infused fluids in the severity or prevention of side effects?",

But, things are beginning to come into focus for us and I find that I can breathe again. Hope you are feeling relief too. Never thought I was vain either but am doing a lot of positive self talk to get ready for the hair loss. For me, being upset about the hair is also about having people, especially those I love, think of me as sick and possibly worse. I would really like to avoid that and think I could pull it off but for the obvious give away. Thought having the eyebrows done with permanent make-up before they fall out might make me feel better and I'm going for it. We have to be kind to ourselves in the coming months and we will all be okay. I've been thinking about bald men and how people have always ridiculed the \"comb over\". Well, I'm really beginning to empathize and will never think it foolish again. ",

I'm right behind you, Indenial and hope we never walk this path again. It's settled, extra fluids for my next (last) chemo. I'm going to need all the help I can get with the next one. Have an energetic 4 year old arriving the day before my infusion and staying for 11 days. Now that I think of it, I'll really need extra steroids too. Thanks to all who responded. On the subject of sex, one of my all time favorite subjects. I often think we take it far too seriously in our relationships. So flirt, tease, be playful and have fun with no expectations of sex. This is a tough time for our men too, and I think most men would be at ease with the playful approach, but keep the heart to heart talks about feelings out of the bedroom because feelings in the context of sex scares the crap out of most men. I've always found it best to let my husband know in advance when I want a conversation about us and feelings. Found it goes much better when he is prepared for it and not surprised and it forces me to think about how I want the conversation to go instead of just putting all that emotion on the table and waiting for his response. Hugs and kisses from an old gal who's taken a few bumpy rides down this road. (love the pun)",

The chemo suites are arranged in an elongated half circle and centered on two nurses' stations. As a first timer, you are placed front and center and watched very carefully for an adverse reaction. Not accustomed to this much attention, it made me think of an inmate in prison.

I'm inspired by how you are adapting to things as they come, many displaying both strength and grace. Some attacking with a sense of humor. I've been following the hair thread (we should call this one a strand) knowing I'm a few weeks behind. The single thing I am unable to handle to this point is the loss of my hair. I cry every time I think of it, the tears are streaming down my face now. It's not vanity, it's that it all becomes so real when the hair goes. After that, there is no denying, no pretending and no hiding the fact that I'm a cancer patient. I will be reminded of it every minute of every day and I will have to face the sad and concerned look on the faces of those people I love most in the world. I'm hoping my fear is worse than my reality. I know this is just one more step in the process of being well and healthy again. My sister is coming up for a head shaving party, having her's shaved too. She's crazy, but she insists it's just hair and she's doing it. Looks like I can't stop her so I'm buying her a beautiful scarf. We've been together for every good, and bad, thing that's happened through our entire life so it's fitting that she be on hand for the balding of a cancer survivor. Before it all comes off, I'm having a picture taken with my hair in a mohawk to send to my two precious grandsons. My way of introducing the new Ya and letting them see that everything is okay. Chemo starts tomorrow morning and I'm so ready to get going. Afraid but determined to graduate at the top of my class.   ",

One woman discussed her reconstruction and her choice to have artistic tattoos over her scars instead of nipple surgery and tattooed aerolas. She then lifted her shirt and showed the group the most beautiful, artistic tattoos. It made me think there are so many different and creative ways to respond to the changes we face. It was also great to have somebody to talk with about doctors, treatment options and side effects. They were great, nobody held anything back. It's funny how our needs are met as they develop. I'm so glad I found this group, you women have helped in so many ways, don' t know that I could have done chemo without you, and now I also have this awesome face-to-face support group.

Think I'll give up the \"chemo watch\" and expect normal as it appears that is what I will experience. What a relief and hope it lasts. However, this did not come without planning on my part. Most of it on tips from you fabulous women. I think it's great that we each find what works for us then share in the event it can help another. For me, a gallon of water daily with lemon, no mouth sores, nutritious meals balanced with fruits, vegetables, carbohydrates and lean protein and healthy snacking has me feeling well and has headed off any digestive issues and nausea. I found a great application for tracking my water, food and activity and find it helps keep me on track. My Fitness Pal is so easy to use, just a few minutes a day will allow you to track water intake, food, nutrients and activity, and I like that instant visual feedback lets me make real time adjustments. Plus, it's keeping me focused on what I control instead of what I can't. It's free in the online App Store. What bone pain I have experienced from the Neulasta seems to have been remedied by a daily Claritin and a nightly acetaminophen PM (benadryl). In addition to curbing the bone pain, I'm sleeping through the night for the first time in a month and waking rested and refreshed. So, like most of you I've been freaking over the hair loss but am realizing that if I'm feeling as good as possible, it too will be do-able and it's starting to be less upsetting. Actually beginning to think I might like a summer in Florida without hot hair. We all know this sucks but for me I find focusing on that alone zaps any positive energy I can use for the fight. Best of all, my smile has returned. You know the one, it's the one that's not manufactured for others' comfort, it's spontaneous, it's happy and it's free of anxiety. I hope yours' has too.",

Every person facing cancer treatment must learn to make it all about them. Their life may very well depend on it.",

I'm laughing at us both when I look up and Larry the Cable Guy is on the history channel. It's even funny that he is on the history channel since he's not particularly educational, but that guy is hilarious, I highly recommend him for a great antidote to the BC blues. Most of us are not laughing much these days and we forget it's good medicine. Think I'll look for some good comedy to download and take my medicine daily. Chemo number two tomorrow and I'm trying to get myself psyched for it. It's tough knowing what's coming at the same time you don't know what's coming or how bad it might be. Isn't it exhausting to be continuously focused on every little twitch of the body and fear it is the beginning of a critical SE or even worse, a metastasis and to know that this feeling will be with you for a long, long time? Beginning to think a therapist might help and looking for some spiritual healing too. Sounds like a wreck doesn't it? Physically, emotionally and spiritually unhealthy all at the same time..... Well my sisters, I hate that we are here, but thank you for being there (for us all) in a way that no one else can. You are a lifeline in so many ways. Warm hugs to all.",
