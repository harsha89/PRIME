Last year I had my annual mammogram and once again for the third year I had stupid calcifications.  Long story short, I had an MRI, Biopsies and lumpectomy and it was atypia with clear margins after the lumpectomy.  I did not have cancer.  I chose to forego the Tamoxifen and get a BMX.  That's right...41 years old completely preventative BMX and did NOT reconstruct.  I have not regretted my decision for one second since (surgery was this past May).  I have great prosthetics (Radiant Impressions) and even my boss just told me two weeks ago that having the surgery was the best decision I could have made because I am a totally different person.  My decision was 1000000% right for me....but not everyone will be able to say that.  My mother was diagnosed with inflammatory breast cancer at age 42 (I am 42 now).  What I saw her go through was indescribable.  Although she was diagnosed as \"terminal\" she beat it!  But here's the cost of that miracle:  She ended up developing Pick's Disease (horrible type of dementia) and dying in a nursing home 20 years after her victory over cancer.  I believe her taking Tamoxifen for 12 years (yes I said 12) and all of the chemo they gave her is what made her brain appear as Swiss cheese on an MRI.  Look up Pick's Disease sometime.  It's horrid.  However, I was a junior in high school when she was diagnosed with the cancer and I would not have been ready to lose her then!  We had her (or some semblance) of her for 20 extra years!  I am the only solid parent my child has.  My husband left us for another woman and is a bi polar nightmare now.  I knew I had to do whatever it took to be here for my son.  And there was no way I wanted him to have the psychological damage that I developed watching my mom go through chemo hell.  When I look back, it all worked together to make my decision easy.  I didn't realize how much I hated my breasts and how much they terrified me.  I just knew I'd face breast cancer someday and my biggest fear was that it was going to be the deadly kind my mom had.  So I fired the first shot and ended the war before it began.   If you do enough soul searching, you'll find the right decision for your own unique situation.  And don't let pushback from your loved ones influence you.  They are NOT in your shoes!  Some of the family members that all but told me I was nuts are now marveling at the change in me and the \"glow\" that I exhude.  And...know that God is with you.  You can talk to Him as well.  He will give you the right path to follow if you just listen for his still small voice.  :) ",

I've found that the only thing that helps me, and it sounds crazy, is to lightly slap the area that is itching. Scratching it almost makes it worse but slapping it lightly somehow soothes.  I've tried everything from bristle brushes to my facial exfoliator! But the area is Numb and the only thing that breaks through the numbness is tapping it or slapping it. Sounds crazy but it works! I am now considering reconstructing and the only thing that terrifies me is that I will have the same phantom itching as really won't be able to do anything about it.",
