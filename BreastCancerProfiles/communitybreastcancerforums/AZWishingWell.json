I did 6mo of AVBD and 21 Rads. My closest friend since childhood found a mass last week. She she went and and confirmed it was not a cyst, its not. In the mammo+US they found a second mass in the right that is about the size of a golf ball. The large one is low and deep against the rib-cage. Its hard and does not move. (She has not described if its rubbery ect). Why am I here? To read... Why else...One story of a benign hard mass that big will give us both peace of mind until the biopsy. My community helped me immensely. TIA for all you do.. Log in to post a reply",
