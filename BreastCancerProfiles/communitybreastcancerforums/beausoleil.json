I am kindof leaning towards forget that and go straight to excising the ducts myself.",

      "Content": "beausoleil wrote: I am so so scared.  Two years ago I had clear discharge from the right nipple, lots of it. Spontaneous discharge. They did a mammo and a diagnostic mammo, both clear. After that they said I needed no more followup. The spontaneous discharge has been gone for a year now.   During a self breast exam I got brown discharge last Friday, but only when pressing and was not able to get much. Called in, had a mammo Monday and a docters appointment Tuesday. They did additional views that morning plus a thorough ultrasound.Nothing showed up and no change fro 2 years ago.  The radiologist said she is less worried about brown discharge, that she can work a brown discharge out of almost every woman my age if she works at it ( I am 42) But she sent me to a breast surgeon that same afternoon. The OB had done a breast exam  and said she could find absolutely no palpable mass whatsoever.   The breast surgeon did an exam and said:\"I found a lump\". He biopsied it right there in the office. He said :\"If it was any smaller  I would not be able to feel it\". during the biopsy he looked at the tissue and seemed a bit surprised and said:\" Hmm I am getting a lot of fatty tissue\" The nurse said that was good, but I don't want to get my hopes up. Then he took 2 more samples and he looked more serious.Can they tell it is bad just by looking??!! I am so so terrified. I keep reading how a discharge with a lump is almost always bad news.  So I wait. For results. I am so afraid. It feels like my whole world has come crashing down. I have 7 kids, several young ones. I can't eat. I cant sleep. I have had hip pain over the outside of my left him with movement that comes and goes, and I am just terrified that I will hear I have bone mets already, .  Log in to post a reply",

He said that when he talked to the pathologist he did not call it cancer, and he did not even call it pre-cancer. He sent out tissue though, so I will not know until Tuesday at the earliest. I asked the doctor:\"If he thought it was cancer, would he have said so\" and the doc said \"yes\". I am so confused. ",
