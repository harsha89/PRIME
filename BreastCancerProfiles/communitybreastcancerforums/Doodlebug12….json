Got my hair all chopped off yesterday. It's really short and actually quite nice. I have everybody in this house organised to within an inch of their lives and hopefully they will all be able to carry on and at least eat... Cooking dinners in my house is always a chore, 5 different dinners most evenings as we are all fussy eaters. I am worried tonight about allergic reactions - I am sensitive to all meds, even ibuprofen makes me sneeze!! Mother arriving in the morning - she is going to move in for a while to help and plus she is on her own and I couldn't bear the thoughts of her being alone worrying about me. I am an only child and she forgets that I am 45 now haha.. Lost my dad to this terrible disease 7yrs ago and mother is reliving everything all over again that she went through with dad and his treatment. DH is being very thoughtful and loving at the moment. He is determined to keep my spirits up. He's truly my rock!! After 20yrs together he is and always will be my best friend. The older girls are a bit down in the dumps today so I brought them shopping for goodies. \u20ac271 later and they are smiling again Hope that everyone is doing well today Love and hugs to everyone here xxxxxx.

I have to say that having chemo is the strangest feeling! I suppose that my s/e's have not been too bad in a sense that I have not been ill but the aches, pains, numbness, mouth sores, general malaise have been tough to deal with. Here I am waiting on DH to collect me and bring me for my 2nd round - oh I am fed up at the thoughts of having to go thru another 8ish days of yeuch!!! Hair is coming out slowly but surely over past 2 days and I can't decide whether to take the plunge and just shave it all off or not. DD's are freaking out over hair loss and I am finding that hard to cope with. A big warm Irish welcome to all the newbies on here. I hope that you are all managing well and am really glad that you have found this wonderful group of people!! I honestly dont think that I could do all this without them Have a lovely day folks - talk soon Michaela",

I am certainly getting fed up playing this game. My ds (9) wants mommy to collect him from school again everyday and my middle dd just wants her life back and everything to get back to normal. Eldest dd is very depressed and spending a lot of time in bed hiding away.... Suppose she more like me that I thought lol. The past 2 weeks have been a nightmare where family life is concerned... They were all waiting on a consultation I had with doc today. News is that he is extremely happy with me and that he is expecting a 100% cure. Type of cancer (tubular) that I have has a low risk of recurrence and any stray lymph nodes that I have will be washed away to boot with radiation. He reckons my body will get used to flushes and that I have a very nice outcome to look forward to. I am a very happy person tonight. Wish I could sleep - its 4.25am here and I am busy cleaning cooker. Darn steroid rush - I'm gonna miss them!!!!! xxxxxxxx michaela",

Had a very sleepless night last night and woke up very early feeling very sick (nerves) got to my hospital at 1.30 and was told to go and have a cigarette and relax for 10 mins with a cup of tea. Came back in feeling a little better. It hurt getting the cannula in place but after that everything was a doddle.. Pre meds went in lovely, steroids and anti-sickness, they gave me stuff to relax me - went from a snivelling wreck to a nearly calm normal person after 10 mins. Wonder would they give me some of that to take home LOL.. Next it was time for the red devil. Nurse infuses this slowly to see how you are toleration it and that went well for me. Next up was the \"c\" can't spell it haha.. That too went in ok, I had the metallic taste in my mouth within minutes and towards the end of that infusion I de eloped a mild sinus headache. I have drank and drank and drank water today. It really helps hydrate you and flushes the red devil out of your system quickly. I came home from hospital and DH made me plain toast with butter and a cup of tea, mother had brought the 3 children out to occupy them in a local mall and I just hit the bed. Slept for 3 good hours and have just been up eating a banana and drinking more tea. I am really happy that today went well. It has given me confidence to carry on. In will deal with whatever comes my way as best I can Eekwine",

Thankfully I am feeling a bit better now and am managing to eat and drink again. Summer girl - I presume u read the article in papers this weekend about the oncotype test. It is o ly available to private patients in Ireland. I was naively under the impression befor I read said article that the test was done routinely over here. Actually went so far as to look for my results to be met with a sort of a \"what\" stare from my bs.. I for one am hopping mad that I didn't get the test. It could have made a HUGE difference to the path that I am now taking. The cost for the test here is \u20ac3200 I am sickened to think that health care has come to this. If they just looked at the cost of the chemo that they are dishing out, surely there would be a saving in costs. I could rant all night about this. When you think of the money wasted in this country over the past few years it makes me want to scream...... Enuf!!! Deep calming breaths michaela!!!! Baking soda is good to gargle with. My onc gave me a script for mycostatin and that helps a lot too (despite the god damn awful taste) Hope everyone well Nighty night Michaela",

My husband and middle daughter are totally against me getting one, preferring the scarf look. My eldest daughter wants me to get a wig that is identical to the hair I have at moment (issues going there, she is in total denial) my 8yr old son is insisting that I get a wig because - in his words, being without hair is sooo embarrassing. As a result I am secretly on-line browsing for a wig that \"I\" might like and had no idea what different terms meant - so thank you madismommy for that. I would be very low on the old self esteem and feel that losing my hair is just going to turn me into an even uglier specimen. Hence the fear of all that is to come. I have visions of turning into a decrepit old woman over night and never being able to regain a tad of self-confidence again. Question for you other lovely ladies that have already started treatment.... Do you all still have the energy to go out places - I ask because eldest daughter is under the impression that I am only going to be allowed to the hospital to receive treatment and then must stay indoors until it is time for next treatment.... Think I might have a bit of a problem on my hands with this 22yr old darling girl that is becoming to think that she is actually the \"mommy\" in our relationship.... Hope everyone is feeling well... I am counting days now (3) to go xx m",

I grabbed the bull by the horns and ordered wigs and head cover and hats and basically everything that I could find on a website to do with hair loss. Have had such fun!!!@roxessence.. I will be eternally grateful to you for your encouraging words re family. You are right, they are driving me crazy and I decided today that I have devoted 22yrs to them all without so much as a moan and for the next 6 months I am taking some \"me time\" they can sort themselves out. The 2 gir,s and my husband are big enough and bold enough to learn how to look after themselves and as for my little man (8yrs) My mother will make sure that everything is in place to keep his life as normal as can possibly be.... @kasi I am delighted that you are feeling back to normal (ish) just think you are now 1 down and only 7 more to go @summergirl",

I actually feel very well this last couple of weeks and am dreading the down that is to come. I hear you about Roche's, I don't think it was the fact that you felt rushed... I think that you are probably like me and just didn't want to be there. The whole process can be so overwhelming at times don't you think... That's why I chose to go online for a wig. Couldn't cope with strangers telling me how \"natural and fantastic\" a wig looked on my head. (not) haha.. I hope that we can be of some support to each other through this.. I feel that I can't talk to anyone else honestly about this process because none of my pals have been through anything like this (thank god). Let's try together to not be scared or terrified... We can both do this and will come out the other side stronger and better. Take care Xx michaela",

Koala kid - poor you bone pain is just rotten and can really drag you down. Would you be able to treat yourself to a very light massage to get the innards working. Are you still drinking lots of water as that helps too. I will PM you tomorrow with a few funny stories re relatives having accidents when we go thru all of this together. Michelleo - huge sympathy to you on the death of your friend. This process makes us all think of our vulnerability but we are a strong group with excellent diagnosis' and are gonna kick C's a** Vtellen - you are in inspiration to me - thank you for all you wonderful advice and research. The general feel good vibes that you seem to send out are worth a million dollars Eek wine I hope that you have a relatively S/E round - anusol - hc spositpries are really fantastic - ask your ocn for a script and try them.",
