You need to get all that energy that is stuck there moving. Trust what your doctors say and find another something to focus on. I'm also a believer in chiropractic. Find a chiropractor that does acupuncture. It can really be nothing. We just don't know what to do with all the anguish. It's prudent to keep investigating, but when it all still looks like nothing, try something new. My cancer resource center offers some free services - healing touch, massage, etc. My saving grace was a health coach that spent a ton of time with me and I could vent all my stuff and then we focused on food - good, healthy food and an intro to yoga. She gave me enough confidence that I went to a yoga class in the community. Yoga Nidra is a yoga nap, more or less. Look for a local session. There is so much modern medicine can't help us with, we have to seek other opportunities to find relief in things we don't really understand, but are worth a shot... If you can manage the anxiety, the pain can become more manageable. I had a lot of time up all night vomiting and writhing in pain to try stuff. I tried the meditation CD from this person and did chanting. http://www.redtwigyoga.com/products.html. It seemed to help. It was a way to focus on something other than the pain. It also will help clear your Chakras. Breathe is also good. My health coach introduced me to these things. (((Hugs)))",

ROs are in a tough spot to get us through the \"gold standard\" protocol with all the stuff running through our heads. We can all choose what we want to do, but if you understand the science they abide by - when we don't do the full protocol, women pay with their lives. You don't say how old you are. I consuluted a couple of ROs and neither would have provided they 5-day brachy even though I was stage 1 and 7mm and 11mm tumors. The RO I went with said he wouldn't recommend Bracy if I were 65 as the 5 year survival is not as good as the gold standard. They know the science. They are passionate about the protocol, because they know the numbers. They know the stats on how things work out in the end. As far as how many days, all I can say is cancer is sneaky and radiation is cumulative. Their math is based on survival stats of women like us. They are truly about our survival. I truly believe we are more about getting our lives back ASAP when we get to radiation and they have a tough job getting through to us. I know that was the case with me. And when it registered, I cried. It was the last thing in the world I wanted. And it sucked. But whatever the future holds, I swung with the biggest bat the smartest doctors on the planet offered. In the end, it's the gift of life to myself. We should also remember, that there is extensive history with radiation that supercedes any of our chemo protocols. It hasn't changed much in a long time. The reason it hasn't changes is nothing has proven to be better. Going less will give you some defense, but not the \"gold standard\" of defense.",

It is not ideal, but it happens. I have met a women who had her lumpectomy redone 4 times to get clean margins.",

Even with all that treatment, my reoccurance numbers is about 15%. My tumors were exceptionally small. Mr. 42 was 7mm. Having had chemo, one of my biggest complaints is life long neuropathy. It is bad in the winter. For 4 percentage points, I think I would skip chemo. That said, my other mantra is cancer is sneaky and we have to swing with the big bat. The real key is making the decision and never looking back. Because my number is still so high, I have eliminated meat and as much animal estrogen from my diet as I can and am trying to improve my odds with my lifestyle. Chemo is doable. I didn't miss work except treatment day. Had CT x4. Jump on tamoxifen and be loyal even if it isn't perfect. Also, did they Oncotype all of your tumors? Do they know for sure if they were all the same? If there's any doubt there, I'd say bring the chemo baby. Hugs and good luck.",

At this time, scores under 20 are mostly no chemo. Scores 20-30, lots of discussion. Anything over 30, throw chemo at it. I also thought if nodes were involved chemo was automatic. It means your cancer has moved from breast to blood tissue. I would be looking for a second opionion with this. They will not start chemo or hormone therapy pills until you have healed. My lumpectomies were Sept. 7 and I started chemo Oct. 13. This was followed by radiation and then hormone therapy. If no chemo, hormone therapy often starts sooner. There's a big difference between 9% and 25% (1 in 10 women with reoccurance or 1 in 4 women with reoccurance). This would be enough for me to get chemo. You don't state your age. I was 43 at diagnosis. With radiation and hormone therapy, by Oncotype reoccurence score had a 33% reoccurance rate. Chemo dropped it to 10-15 percent. I believe in swinging with the big bat and then live with gusto. We can't second guess ourselves. Some positives in your diagnosis is the ER/PR + and Her2-. This is the most treatable type and there are many options. Find out more about yours.",
