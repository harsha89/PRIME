Im 44, two beautiful kids, life is pretty awesome except I have a looming surgery to tell me if nodes are involved, which of course means chemo would be a serious consideration for me. Chemo has always meant something tragic in my family, but times have indeed changed, I know now it would be manageable with proper support. The past 2 wks have been hellish waiting for test results, but strangely once I had confirmation I had IDC (two places) I was actually relieved to finally wrap my mind around something and investigate a potential treatment plan, because I had already skipped all that and planned my own funeral in my head. Thankfully I have had wonderful medical support and knowledge is power. Life is not a tragedy (unless you think it is). God bless you and I will say prayers for you while you figure out your gameplan.",
