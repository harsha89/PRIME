I went in for a follow up ultrasound today and found out that not only had it gotten bigger, but that there were three more around it. My doctor's current suggestion is that I get at least the original surgically removed, since it's getting kinda big. I'm still a little nervous though of the thought of surgery, so I was wondering if those of you who have had a fibroadenoma removed could help me out. Will I probably have to stay overnight? Is there likely to be scarring? What is the postop like? Sorry if those are a lot of questions or if they're bad to ask, I'm just getting kinda anxious, is all. Thanks. Log in to post a reply",
