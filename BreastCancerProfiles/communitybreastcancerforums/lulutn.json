I went to routine mammogram on Feb 12th and received my first ever call back letter in the mail. I'm 46 and I've been doing mammos since I was 40. I picked up a copy of my radiology report and it stated that I have a questionable area of architectural distortion left breast 12:00 and 13-15 centimeters from the nipple. BI-RADS 0 for additional spot views of left breast and ultrasound if needed. Comparison was to Nov 2017 mammo and multiple prior studies. I have had soreness and tenderness in the areola and nipple area but both breast but more so on the left one. I finally got them to work me in today for additional tests. The mammo tech showed me the area of concern and pulled up last years and showed me the spot there as well and stated that it was more prominent now. She did scans and I didn't get to see today's but left out to check with radiologist and immediately came back and said all was fine. I said no ultrasound?? She said no that she was able to flatten it out and everything was fine and to follow up in a year. Well the news seems great but still lingering in my mind. How was a small spot last year that never was noted and then stated it was more prominent now... These spots are in the same area over a year apart from two different techs that did mammos. Is that normal?? For the breast to be twisted or whatever in the same spot as 15 months ago?? Why wouldn't she still do an ultrasound?? Am I over thinking this? Thanks in advance for your input. ",
