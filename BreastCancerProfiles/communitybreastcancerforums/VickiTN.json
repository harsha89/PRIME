I had a lumpectomy with sentinel node removal two and a half years ago...I can't remember how long it was that I \"took it easy\" and didn't lift heavy objects, etc. But, it's best to err on the side of being over cautious and over protective of yourself rather than over doing things and causing problems for yourself.  I was told by my surgeon that even if I only had the one node removed, that I am still at risk of developing LE. So, do not let anyone take blood pressure or draw blood, etc. on that arm. hugs, vicki",
