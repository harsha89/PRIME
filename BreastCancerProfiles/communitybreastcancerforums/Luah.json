I did read up on some of the studies on the long-term effects on A, and as I recall once you are over 400 mg (? not sure of measure, I'll be up to 416 by last treatment), the risk of LVF was about 5%, so not trivial but certainly less than my odds of cancer recurrence.   I had an EKO and muga prior to treatment, but wouldn't it make sense to do that again midway to see how your heart is holding up?   Are any of you getting that? I wonder what good a baseline is if they don't use that to make treatment decisions, only to blame the chemo for later damage.  I know for 2-3 days following treatment, I get a pounding heartbeat sometimes, even a fluttery feeling with irregular pulse, that just passes in a few moments. I thought this might be the steroid, but the sheet I have doesn't list that as a SE. So I've reported it to my onc's nurse today... haven't heard back yet. ",

Otter, congrats to you for being so well-informed and advocating on your behalf. I wish I had spoken up at the time - I had reservations about the nurse, but didn't make a fuss, and should have. I also like to do a lot of research and the first time I met with my onco she seemed a bit irritated with me, but she has since improved and is now receptive to my questions and challenges, and listens!  Sometimes I think it takes them a while to figure out what kind of patient they have in front of them - some pts like to turn their care over to a trusted expert - and some like to take a  more active role. On the other hand, some docs will never get it!",

Doctors usually give you 3 weeks before starting rads so you can gain a little strength back.  If you're of the \"whatever it takes to keep it away\" mindset, you should go for the rads, imo.

I know there may be cancer cells floating around, which will hopefully be zapped to death on chemo, but at least this is a good sign for now.  Nodes appear clear on U/S, but the path from SNB will say for sure.  Another piece of good news today: I thought I would have to wait til Oct. 30th for surgery, but an opening came up for the 15th.  It will still be a month since diagnosis and I wish it could be sooner, but my surgeon's excellent and I can live with this (and I will!).  ",

Micromets is a different story, and as different studies show different things about their significance in terms of treatment/prognosis, doctors may take different approaches, depending on your pathology and planned treatment. They may suggest leaving it, leaving it to chemo, radiating, or doing surgery. The important thing is to ask lots of questions, challenge them even, and have them defend their recommendation. As this is a murky area, you may not get clearcut direction... do what feels right, ultimately it's up to you....as agonizing as that is... and don't look back.  Fwiw, I had 4 senitnels drawn, 1 with isolated cells, another with so many isolated cells the pathologist said it should be considered micromets, even though the cells weren't clumped. Being triple negative with a sizable tumour (actually 2), I knew I was doing chemo anyway... the question was, ALND or extra rads to the nodes? Research was just beginning to appear about radiation in place of ALND, but in the end I chose ALND because I wanted evidence if any additional nodes were affected (they weren't) - rather than trusting chemo and rads to do it. I've had no LE but I'm not sure I would make that same choice today - hard to say.",

Nothing wrong with keeping the BS appointment and asking more questions about surgery... and taking a few more days to do the onco research. Do you know the hormone status of your mother's tumour from the biopsy? That may affect her decision on which to do first. She should also expect to be referred for several tests: breast MRI, abdominal ultrasound, chest Xray, bone scan and/ or PET. This helps them detect any other signs of cancer and properly stage her cancer... and may also affect next treatment step. It is a lot ot take in. Take baby steps, research reputable sources of information, and don't hesitate to ask lots of questions with her docs and here.        ",

My own calculation (and I am triple negative so I don't have the luxury of choosing other medical treatments) goes from 66% to 82% survival 10 years out - that's a net improvement of about 25%, I'll take it. Obviously this tool isn't perfect, but it's something to consider. I don't agree with your perception that chemo is recommended to the exclusion of other therapies, such as hormonal. In recent years, for example, the oncotype test has been enormously helpful in trying to predict who might benefit most (and least) from chemo. Many many ER+ women with low scores forfeit chemo as a result - and this would not have been the case 10 years ago. There have indeed been many medical treatment advances too - Herceptin has been huge for Her2+.  I understand your impatience - there is not yet a proven biologic therapy that can be put to wide use for TN treatment, for example - but at the same time I value, respect, support and advocate for the scientific process.  ",

If trastusumab proves highly effective alongside chemo, I would bet you will see some clinical trials testing it as a single agent -- and yes, probably with metastatic patients to start or those who can't tolerate chemo.
