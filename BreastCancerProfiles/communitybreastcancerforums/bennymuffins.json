I am just over a D and I literally am walking around my house holding MPOB up. No matter what I do, what I try, I can't get rid of the pain. I can't do anything because I only have one free hand (the other is holding up MPOB). Two weeks of this?

Anyway, I am 54 years old and was just diagnosed this morning with BC. I've had two biopsies on breast and lymph nodes. They are removing all my lymph nodes on the right side so I am assuming it is advanced stage. I meet with the oncologist tomorrow for a list of tests I have to do (CAT scans, etc), then will find out what stage. This came totally out of the blue for me. I have always been healthy, been a vegetarian for 32 years of my 54 on the planet. I am in total shock, like a nightmare that I will awake from. I am alternating between shock and crying. Please take no offense to this, but this is not a forum I ever wanted to join. The counsellor has told me to 'stay neutral'; do not catastrophize my situation. Don't start thinking about death, but it's so hard not to. Sept 17 - Lumpectomy and 15 lymph nodes removed. Cancer in breast is 1.7 cm; 6/15 lymph nodes. Stage IIIa, grade 3, estrogen positive.

Anyway, I am 54 years old and was just diagnosed this morning with BC. I've had two biopsies on breast and lymph nodes. They are removing all my lymph nodes on the right side so I am assuming it is advanced stage. I meet with the oncologist tomorrow for a list of tests I have to do (CAT scans, etc), then will find out what stage. This came totally out of the blue for me. I have always been healthy, been a vegetarian for 32 years of my 54 on the planet. I am in total shock, like a nightmare that I will awake from. I am alternating between shock and crying. Please take no offense to this, but this is not a forum I ever wanted to join. The counsellor has told me to 'stay neutral'; do not catastrophize my situation. Don't start thinking about death, but it's so hard not to. Sept 17 - Lumpectomy and 15 lymph nodes removed. Cancer in breast is 1.7 cm; 6/15 lymph nodes. Stage IIIa, grade 3, estrogen positive.
