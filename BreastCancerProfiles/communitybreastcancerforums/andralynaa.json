I finally got around to googling and was surprised to see what came up. I know it doesn't mean I have breast cancer, but it still kind of freaked me out. I have an appointment with my doctor's nurse practitioner on wednesday and I've felt like she has blown me off a little in the past, but I didn't want to wait weeks to see the doctor. So my question is, what tests should I be making sure she orders? I've always heard about mammograms in conjunction with breast cancer. Is that good enough? I can't feel a lump exactly when I press on the breast, but when I compare to the other breast, this one feels hard and feels like there's more tissue there. Although my breasts are fairly dense to start with I think. I just want to make sure that I'm doing everything that's necessary because I don't want to overlook something important and regret that I didn't push for a test I should have known about.
