And I have been through menopause from a hysterectomy in 2013. The fatigued was bad too. Went to doctor and she started the test. Blood work came back normal. Mammogram results are: The breasts are heterogeneously dense. CC and MLO views of both breast were performed. A few scattered microcalcifications are present. Additionally a grouped microcalcifications are visualized within upper quadrant of right breast, 10:00 position, centered 6cm from nipple. These microcalifications span over 1.3 cm. Spot compression magnification were obtained demonstrating these are Pleomorphic microcalcifications no linearity or branching is identified. Bi rad 4C. Tomorrow is my breast biopsy and I'm trying to stay positive. But when I talked to my doctor about results. All she really said was we need to do more testing but it looks not good. So here I am waiting for tomorrow. And then wait 3-5 days for results. Waiting is The worst part of this process so far. Any input from people that have been through this would be greatly appreciated. Log in to post a reply",

But this time I was was thinking this will be easy. No big deal. BOY WAS I WRONG!! Numbing stuff didn't kick in for some reason. I kept telling doctor but he kept going. Felt all 15 samples come out. By the last one my body went into shock from pain. I was shaking uncontrollably and headache from hell. After 30 minutes of them pressing on me to try to get the bleeding to stop, nurses said ok our hands are tired good enough. By this time I was freaked out so bad I didn't stay for \"recovery\" (sit in a room for 45 minutes) I had them take out my iv and left. Numbing medicine finally kicked in after my 40 minute ride home. Slept rest of day. Next day I had the worst neck and back pain I could barely move. But had follow up with my doctor. He said I was still bleeding. So another hour of someone pushing one me to finally get it to stop. Gave me some nausea medicine since I was feeling so sick. Told me to just take Tylenol. Today is day 2 and I had a pretty normal day. Felt ok babysat my friends 17 month old. Thought I was fine until about an hour ago and now I'm feeling it. But that's my own fault. Still no results as of tonight. Hope I hear something tomorrow. But pray by Friday. Don't know if I can make it through the weekend not at least knowing yes or no. Glad I found this blog. Thanks again for support.",
