I called the Medicaid office earlier and the first thing they have to have is a copy of the pathology report from the biopsy. She said she's been doing this a long time and hasn't seen them deny coverage when cancer is there...but it does only cover certain types. She said I shouldn't worry so I'm going to try not to. I have enough other things to worry about right now. I am married and have 3 kids...16, 13 and a 10 years old. I really feel like things are going to be ok and I will beat this...I hope I'm not being naive.",
