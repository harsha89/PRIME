More than just being naturally different. And the warmth is just the entire chest where I have the redness not much warmer than the rest of my body, might be normal just can't tell. Thanks for the reply.",

      "Content": "KLunsure wrote: Hello, I figured I'd post here because I don't know what else to do to get advice and piece of mind before my appointment with a doctor next Wednesday. I'm 21 years old and I recently noticed a firm lump in the upper left part of my left breast as well as swelling and warmth. I know people my age usually don't have anything more than a cyst or other benign conditions, but I have an extensive family history on both sides of breast cancer under the age of 35 so I want to be proactive and cautious. The closest family I have with it was my maternal grandmother diagnosed 29 passed 33 and fraternal cousin diagnosed a few months ago at 29 but there are dozens of females in my family that have/had it or tumors. Like I said I'm just really nervous and even though it's probably a cyst or hormones (even though I have had an iud for 2 years and no period for 1 year) or at best infection from my nipple piercings (8 months old, all proper after care taken) and I'm feeling like a hypochondriac I just wanted advice or input before my appointment next week to put me at ease. When I found the lump and pain in the breast tissue around it I started to worry and then put together that the symptoms of other things I thought were unrelated might be all related as the warning signs of breast cancer. My breasts have always been very symmetric and my nipples the same, when I found the lump I noticed the left breast was much larger than usual and my nipple had darkened, become weird shaped and larger than the other, as well as inverted (but it's hard to tell with the piercing bars in if its the same inverted sign to look for), the nipple has also been dry, flaky, sore randomly, and bled lightly from the sides of the piercing even though nothing had hit or snagged them but I chalked it up to healing, my lymph nodes under my left arm pit are also swollen large, the past few months the skin on my chest/breasts has become red, a little rough, and warm to the touch (especially the left) but it's not like a sunburn, and a month or two ago on my left breast on the inner cleavage side I noticed what I though looked like stretch marks (my boobs haven't grown or shrunk much at all in the past year so I though it was strange but figured it happens) and it's getting deeper slightly and is just little divots like a dotted line, I've also been extremely fatigued and have no energy or appetite but I thought I might have had a cold or something. The lump is very firm, almost solid, irregular shaped, but I can't tell if it moves when I move my fingers around it or if my tissues around it is moving but it stays in the same place every time I check it. I just wanted to hear your thoughts on this to see if you experienced similar things like how you felt, symptoms you had, what your lump felt like, and just general info and advice to help me not freak out as much until my appointment. Any information would help me. Thank you. Log in to post a reply",
