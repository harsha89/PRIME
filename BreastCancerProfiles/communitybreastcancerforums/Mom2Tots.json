I wasnt exactly impressed with MDA.  Lots of stupid mistakes like what you describe in your post.  In my opinion there was always an excuse.  Don't get me wrong, I am alive and cancer free. Glory be to Jesus. And, I met some great people.  I just wasnt that impressed overall.  In my mind, I would have received comparable treatment in NY.  And, here's another kicker.....the PS at MDA didnt offer/recommend a DIEP for me.  She was going to do a TRAM.  After two consultations with other PSs, I ended up having a contralateral MX and bilateral reconstruction @ NOLA.  Now NOLA...they are impressive!!!!  Their work, their support staff, and their facility is top notch. ",

And you want to feel but you want to feel comfortable.  Shame on that doctor for trying to shame you.",
