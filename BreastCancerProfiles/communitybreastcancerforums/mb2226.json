But more than that- I wonder why you have to wait until April 13??????  That seems a long time, not in terms of how much more damage can be done, but in terms of emotionally.  I had a biopsy Tues afternoon, got the results Wed morning and saw my surgeon Thursday.  I had the lumpectomy about a week or 2 later, I think. So - it was helpful to move rapidly through the first steps, which didn't really give me time to worry/wonder a lot -- just got moving on fixing it.  I don't understand why your docs won't move the appt up?  And yes - you can grieve before you get tough. But -- actually starting treatment will help a lot,I think.  Best wishes,,, mb",

I would doubt seriously that you will need a mastectomy. Nobody ever even suggested I needed that, and my tumor was 6 times larger than yours. And, in bc - size matters a LOT.  So although I know its easier said than done -- you've got this really early, and the grade probably won't make any difference at all... best, mb",

My surgeon and onc just told me to do the exercises but without the intervention of the PT I don't think it would have worked.  I had my SNB Oct. 27 and started physical therapy a month later -- the PT said the earlier you addressed it, the better.  Good luck, embee",

I went to a physical therapist (who had had breast cancer herself) and in 2 sessions she broke up the scar tissue and my arm was perfect. Never had another problem. My surgeon did not suggest this move -- they tend to give you exercises to do.  But I think having the PT do it makes things a lot faster and more effective.  I think it should be the standard of treatment for cording.  Good luck, MB",
