All of this began with visits to find out why I have been so fatigued and nauseated and experiencing a plethora of other strange symtpoms. Since my last obgyn appointment I have gotten sicker and sicker, going from an active young adult to a sore, tired and unable to take care of my daughter. I am very concerned because of the additional swollen nodes I found in my neck and under arms as well as excruciating back and arm pain. I feel like I am falling apart. I want to tell my family how worried I am but I feel bad about worrying them too if it is something else.. any input or personal experience? Megan Log in to post a reply",
