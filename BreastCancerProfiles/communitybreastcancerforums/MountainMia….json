I know -- we all know -- how consuming it is, and this is a good place to air your worries, and to find out volumes of other information. But in truth, you'll get your best information on this issue Friday with your own medical team. What you DO know for now (and it's good to focus on what you DO know, not on what you don't know) is that you've had a concern about that breast for some time, that your first mammo didn't show anything that called attention to itself, and that this one did. You also know that the medical team is being cautious and prudent, wanting to compare your first one with the recent one. You do know that they want you to be comfortable as possible for your day on Friday. And you do know that you'll get better information after that. It's so hard to wait. If possible, take today and tomorrow just focusing on today and tomorrow. Friday will come soon enough. Wishing you the best!",

There are a lot of friends here, people who can help you understand what's going on with your treatment and recovery and offer encouragement along the way. There are a variety of comments threads, called \"topics,\" that focus on various parts of the process. They're posted under \"forums,\" such as the Just Diagnosed one you've used. Also note the left margin \"All Topics\" gives a listing that is sort of a big table of contents. The search function lets you look for keywords, and the list of abbreviations can be found on the blue button at the bottom on the left margin.

But in the last few days I've started thinking less about how cancer might kill me and more about how I can kill cancer. Killing cancer means either losing my hair or being the natural exception or cold-capping, which I'm not willing to do. So BUH-BYE, HAIR!!! Every day I see my bald head in the mirror, and every day I feel the stubble on my scalp, and every day I find a stray old hair on a shirt or blanket or in my quilting fabric, I'm gonna say F^#& YOU, CANCER. I am KILLING YOU. Knowing that I'm killing cancer, and that the hair is proof of that, will be my consolation. That's my aspiration. That's how I hope I feel, like a warrior. An Amazon.

Here is a link to the May group https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/69/topics/871135?page=1 Also, if you know what kind of chemo you'll use, there are some specific threads that can help with that info.

If you're doing laundry, someone needs to haul your laundry basket to and from the washer. If you're washing or putting away dishes, move them one at a time with the affected arm, not in stacks. Don't move today's Easter casserole dish from the oven by yourself. Someone else should do that. Pay attention to your movements and you will make the right choices.
