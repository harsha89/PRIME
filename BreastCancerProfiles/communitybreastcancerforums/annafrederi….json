I would have thought an oncologist would have told me something like that. He actually got kind of pissy with me when I asked why I wasn't informed. How did you make out Cynthia?",

Joaniji, THANK you for letting me know your extraction was successful. I feel kind of stupid now. I had no idea this could be a spontaneous thing. When you look at it that way, I guess, what have you got to lose, if it could happen regardless of dental work. Gawd, it never ends. I really really hate cancer. Good luck to you as well, Cynthia!",
