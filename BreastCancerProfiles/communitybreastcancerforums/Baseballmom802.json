    "Content": "Baseballmom802 wrote: Hello, I am hoping that you all can provide me with some piece of mind. I am 43 years old and typically have pretty bad cyclical breast pain. Last weekend, along with the cyclical pain, I noticed my left breast was larger than my right one. I put it out of mind until this weekend when I was able to notice the difference while wearing my shirt. It looks as if my right breast has lost some weight and is not filling the cup in my bra like usual. My cyclical breast pain has improved and I have not noticed anything else out of the ordinary. Have any of you ladies been diagnosed with cancer with the only symptom being a change in the size of one of your breasts? I had a mammogram a year and a half ago that came back normal. Thanks in advance for your guidance Log in to post a reply",
