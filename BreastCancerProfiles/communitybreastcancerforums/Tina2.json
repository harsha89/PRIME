Of course the restaurant is conducting a huge sales campaign and touting the beneficiary as the Breast Cancer Foundation.

Most appear only too willing to accept story ideas and handouts from publicity-seekers of all sorts, both individuals and organizations. Others fill a page or 60 seconds with outmoded information, cliches and slogans gathered by the office intern, toss in a few stock photos, then consider their job done until next October. Unfortunately, 54.1 million people will read this article. Many will believe every word. They will never consider that it might contain errors or leave out important information. This situation will continue until someone or something breaks through and permanently overcomes the effect of many years of propaganda about breast cancer. In the meantime, we can assume that many otherwise intelligent and informed people may believe our Stage IV status is somehow our fault.

As if it were written in 1985, the article implies heavily that early detection and treatment equals cure. There is no mention of the 30% of early-stage women who have had their cancer treated promptly and still progress, nor of those who are living with and dying of metastasized cancer. In fact, the word metastasis does not appear in the entire text. This is a real disservice to the public, not to mention we women with Stage IV cancer who will be seen by many who read and believe this sort of piece as having been careless with our health.

I have refrained from expressing my feelings on this matter over the past months because things have happily calmed down in the last few weeks, but this issue has a tendency to wax and wane, so I'm going to say my piece now. While I feel for them all, I too get weary of redirecting, reassuring, educating and soothing the family members and friends of people with Stage IV who come to this particular forum for support. Some treat us as moms or therapists, others as textbooks or doctors. Others are surprisingly demanding and, when gently told to seek solace or information elsewhere, can become upset or even abusive. We've all seen tempers rise to flameouts on this forum because of this, and been made uncomfortable by the resultant ill feelings and polarization. No one wants to be mean or unwelcoming, and many forum members think supporters and family members should be able to post here, but sometimes they take up far more room and air and time here than they should--and therein lies the problem. The current descriptor of this forum contains a sentence that literally invites participation by people who are not Stage IV.:\"Please respect that this forum is for Stage IV, their families and caring supporters only.\" It would be a simple matter for the moderators to revise this language. If they don't, we risk losing more participants who have metastatic/Stage  IV breast cancer but are dispirited and exasperated by the fallout from this ongoing issue. Members can come up with suggestions to address this problem, but moderators are the only people who have the power to implement a solution. Tina",

We NEED a place of our own, where we can vent and share and feel safe among each other, and not be constantly called upon to be comfort others, to be advisors, psychologists and mommies.

I have always been interested in science and like you, believe that words are important and knowledge is power. However, since barely a generation has passed since the word \"cancer\" was said in frightened whispers and the subject not discussed among \"polite\" people, it's probably too much to expect that everyone be well-versed in the subject.

And once the news is out, you can't retract it and you can't control it. When I was first diagnosed at Stage IV last July, my partner and I sat down and made a carefully considered, tiered list of friends. We put very close friends and family members in the first group and told them individually, mainly in person over a period of weeks, making sure we did so in quiet and comfortable circumstances--often before or after dinner-- in which we could explain everything and they could ask questions. Less close friends and colleagues are in the second and third groups. We have not told them and probably will not until it is inevitable. I confess that there are some occaisions during which I feel as if I am lying in keeping such a huge secret to myself, and that is painful and lonely, but it's something I need to do at this moment.",

Conversely taking aspirin before diagnosis increased overall mortality risk by 62% and doubled the risk of dying from breast cancer after contracting the disease.\" Reading the first sentence, I would gather that overall it's a good idea to take aspirin if one already has breast cancer. Reading the second, I learn that aspirin may increase one's risk of dying of anything and helps kill one faster if one takes it before one gets breast cancer. Reading both together I conclude that this study raises too many questions to be clinically useful at this point. It makes me question the motives of those who released it. Could this be an example of \"Publish or perish?\" BTW, I have taken 81mg of aspirin for several decades on the advice of my primary care practitioner. My Stage I cancer, quiescent since 1995, was diagnosed as metastatic four years ago. Tina ",

Well, it turns out that this innocuous lump (not pearly, not reddened, not bleeding) is a basal cell carcinoma. Next step: consulting with a Mohs surgeon. Argh!

Of course I have consulted Dr. Google, who helpfully points out that I have no symptoms of brain or eye mets, then mentions that some people don't have symptoms.

I relaxed my legs as instructed and found the injections tolerable and not at all as lengthy as I had expected. Here's the best news: the results of most of my blood tests have come back and show no evidence of disease spread. My bone scan showed no metastases--just loads of arthritis, which I can live with! My doctor is encouraged and says I can probably do well on the Faslodex for months, possibly even years. When the cancer changes to circumvent that treatment, he'll choose another hormonal approach from his arsenal, then, at some point, go to chemo. I am amost giddy with relief and optimism. I was petrified for a few days, but thanks to the good test results, the \"not bad\" first treatment, my confidence in my oncologist, and the encouraging posts on this forum, I can see a real future!",

Rosieo, I think Faslodex treatment is inappropriate for you; it's an anti-hormonal and your cancer is triple negative. Please check with your onc to find out what can be done about your cough. Lalady, the major SEs I have from Faslodex are joint pain (in addition to arthritis!) and weight gain (on top of aging!). The pesky, merely annoying ones are injection site lumps, pain and itching. I have asked my onc about Ibrance. He wants to hold it in abeyance as long as the Faslodex is working on its own. This is fine with me. Tina",

This allows me to take a ginormous flying leap of wishful thinking and wonder if this might portend that my mets might remain confined to my lungs where they may be controllable with treatment. I have a particular personal interest in the subject of long-dormant lung mets because mine were seen on scans and dubbed \"nodules\" and \"scars\" and \"groundglass opacities\" many years before they became obviously active and diagnosed for what they actually were/are.  Tina",

BTW, does anyone else here find it puzzling that there seems to be a plethora of support groups and suchlike offered by hospitals and other cancer-related organizations for early-stage folks, and few or none for metsters? If MBC is morphing into a \"chronic condition\" with longer survival expectations, where are the community offerings that acknowedge this? ",

I got the shingles vaccine as soon as my doctor suggested it several years ago, along with the pneumonia vaccine. At the request of a pregnant niece, I got the pertussis vaccine. I get a flu shot religiously every fall and have never had a single ill effect. As an aside, I will add that one of my younger brothers and I contracted polio as children during the last big U.S. epidemic, right before the Salk vaccine became available. It was a terrifying experience, particularly for my brother who was just three. We both came through beautifully, but many children and adults died or were permanently affected by paralysis and lung disorders. I believe in vaccines. They have spared countless people much suffering. Please get the vaccine if your oncologist approves.",

      "Content": "Tina2 wrote: I live in a large metropolitan area with many hospitals and two huge, competing radiology corporations that have franchise operations at some hospitals as well as freestanding facilities all around the city and suburbs. My oncologist is independent, so I got my last PET-CT and CT scans at one of the latter organizations. Although large, the outfit has only one PET machine, which is in a downtown office. I had my last PET and CT at that particular office, and just scheduled my upcoming CT for there, mentioning to the appointments desk that the office is less conveniently located for me than one closer to my home, but that I've learned I should be scanned on the same machines.   She said the important thing is that the scans be done by the same organization, and that there were several CT machines in this particular downtown office alone, so the chances are iffy of getting into the same one. There is also the likelihood that a different radiologist in the organization will read and report on the images, as has occurred  before.   I know that images are shared via the organization's computer network, so I am not concerned about the interpreting radiologist being able to compare new images with previous scans, etc., but I am a bit worried about the emphasis I see on this forum about using the same machines each time. I don't know how many of us really have that option.   Since I hope to be having scans for many years to come, I\u2019d appreciate knowing the opinions of other Stage IV women. Of course, I\u2019ll ask my oncologist next time I see him, too.   Tina     Stage I, 1985, modified radical mastectomy; Stage I, 1995, modified radical mastectomy;Stage IV, lung mets, ER+/PR+; treated with Faslodex since July, 2011 Dx Stage IV, mets, ER+/PR+ Log in to post a reply",

She visited with us first, heard our cat's medical history from us (she had already talked with our regular vet), gently examined the cat in our bed where she had been for many hours and concluded that her quality of life was deteriorating irrevokably. We all leaned over the bed, softly talking with the cat and petting her until it was over. The vet took the body for cremation. When we get the ashes we will bury them in the garden with those of her sister who died years ago. The whole experience was calm, considered and so preferable to going to the vet's office. I am sad, but also relieved that our little girl is out of pain. Once again I think we kept her going too long, but we had to be ready as well. It's always hard. Thanks, Chickadee, for the Rainbow Bridge. When I was making coffee this morning and starting to collect all the kitty stuff around the house for cleaning and storage, I fantasized about meeting up with all my pets on some other plane. I haven't had that many over my lifetime, but it was an amusing picture: a gathering of three five-and-dime-store turtles, several unfortunate goldfish, one darling cocker spaniel-beagle mix, one DC alley cat, one diabetic calico and two brown tabby sisters: one a clown and one a diva. It would be quite a reunion! With thanks for your sympathy, Tina",

I'm quite fair as well, and gave up trying to tan after a blistering burn or two in my teens. (Kids are SO dumb.) Now I usually wear sunscreen and a hat while gardening or playing in summer sun. However, one's face is always hanging out exposed to the elements, so chances of getting a skin cancer there increase with age. And few think to apply sunscreen for running around in the city. I admit I don't. Saw the Mohs surgeon today. He's young and clearly a superstar, with many rave reviews, and offers lots of good info on his website. His nurse answered all the questions I had before he even entered the room. All he had to do was check out the site, mark the area so I could see what he thinks he'll cut out, and tell me that the cosmetic result will not be readily visible to anyone but me in about six months. Can't ask for much more than that. I really liked this doctor and his staff. Since I'll be traveling next month, I'll have the surgery early in November. Tina",

Enjoyed new experiences in places we'd never visited, met up with old friends, and saw a lot of theatre in London. Returned home in time for my Faslodex treatment and had MOHS surgery yesterday. It went as well as it possibly could have! The surgeon \"got it all\" in the first pass, so I was out of his office in about four hours. The wound before it was sewn up looked like an off-center medium-size bullet hole in my forehead- like one of those fake corpses in an NCIS pathology scene, shot by a nearsighted bad guy. I took the pressure bandage off this afternoon, and am icing the site and taking Advil and Tylenol. Swelling and bruising are not bad at all. I am grateful for the order to \"be a couch potato for 48 hours,\" but I am eager to get back to bopping around. The steristrips come off Monday, so then I'll see how prominent the scar is. Glad that's over! Thanks for your support, my friends.",

What I've been curious about for a while is if you actually see the word \"stable\" on your reports. Apparently you have, Mrs. M., as have many of you. I have never seen the word \"stable\" on my reports.  I simply conclude that if there is nothing new or if mets are shrinking, that is \"stable,\" whether the word is used or not.  Could I be mistaken in assuming this? My doctor has not indicated that I am wrong. Maybe the radiologists who read my scans have an aversion to or policy against using the \"s\" word. Waiting for scan results again, Tina",

She gave me a quick bottom-line reading of \"NED.\" Today I finally received written reports from the new radiologist my once recommended. Here are his impressions: 1. Abdomen and pelvis: \"Benign cysts in liver and both kidneys. There is no evidence for metastatic disease. There has been no significant change since the prior study.\" 2. CT of chest: \"Pulmonary densities involving the right upper lobe and left lower lobe with some new densities in the posterior left lower lobe, possibly benign. No definite metastatic disease is seen.\" The first report is clearly cause for celebration. The second concerns me a bit. In the \"findings' section, the doctor ventured that the new densities \"may well be inflammatory in origin,\" but I'm not happy about their being there at all. However, I do have allergies, so maybe that's the cause. Additionally, I am not a big fan of \"possibly benign\" or \"no definite metastatic disease is seen\" language. Is this weasel wording?

Bottom line regarding cancer: No \"definite\" or \"specific\" (love those weasel words) evidence of metastasis in hips or pelvis. BIG sigh of relief. Yes, indeed. As far as my other parts are concerned, my left hip is a deteriorating mess, as we knew, but now we know more detail. My right hip has problems as well, but fewer than the right. The lumbar spine issue remains. There are a couple of other bone things that turned up, but no apparent mets. This news clears the way for me to go to my rheumatologist and determine the next step I can take toward pain-free mobility via an orthopedic route. I hope there is something that can be done surgically that is not as big a deal as hip replacement. Maybe that's unrealistic under the circumstances, but we'll see. Hope springs eternal and all that. As he was leaving the exam room my oncologist said, out of the blue, \"Don't let them tell you that you can't have surgery because you have cancer. They do not need to be conservative.\" While I'M the one who might want to be conservative regarding surgery, I was pleased to hear him say this. It indicates to me that he envisions me walking around for a good, long time. Thank you for hanging with me through this. Now I'm off to take my post-Faslodex snooze. Tina",

I have come through! The tech and I talked yesterday and concluded that we could consolidate the two studies scheduled for next week (pelvis and right hip) into one on Monday. He tried to reach my onc to check, but could not get him on the phone. So, one MRI down, one to go. If my doc says I have to back for a third, so be it. Thanks for hanging in with me on this. Lorazepam is amazing as a claustrophobia calmative. I took two: one an hour before the scan was scheduled and one just before the scan itself. I had minimal anxiety in the machine and felt okay later, just a bit dimmed down. My partner said there was something missing in my personality, maybe my usual edge?  Went to out to lunch, then home to sleep the calm, comfy sleep of the slightly drugged. Lovely. Really.

I was squirming in the car and by the time I returned home was pacing around in circles from the pain, which finally diminished after a few hours. I thought at the time that it must feel that way to be shot with a bullet. Maybe she hit a nerve. Maybe she gave the shot far too fast. Regardless, at my next visit I reported the occurrence to my doctor and requested that this young woman not come near my rear end again. She has not; only RNs have. By reporting this, I think I may also have made the practice realize that non-medical techs should not be administering IM injections.

He's the kind of guy who takes great stock in his chatty cheeriness overcoming patients' dread. In quickly filling him in on my current tooth issue, I told him I was there because my regular dentist had spotted what looked like a problem on a recent x-ray. When I mentioned that I had metastatic breast cancer and was in treatment, he said breezily, \"Oh we all have our bumps in the road.\" He then went into a rollicking, highly-polished, ten-minute monologue on how well he came through two knee replacements last year, surprising all and sundry with his quick recovery and physical prowess. He left the exam room to see another patient, so I had plenty of time to stew and consider how I was going to handle this. When he returned, I waited until he delivered the bad news (root canal, big surprise) then looked him in the eye and calmly said, \"Listen, I need to tell you something. You should not compare Stage IV breast cancer to 'a bump in the road.'  Having metastatic breast cancer is not 'a bump in the road.'\"  He quickly became solemn, said \"No, of course it isn't\" and appeared genuinely chastened. While he didn't actually apologize, he did seem sorry, and then began asking questions about my treatment. (His questions proved he didn't know much about metastatic breast cancer and nothing about anti-hormonal treatments, but that's another issue, one I see in with depressing frequency in medical professionals.) I realize his tongue was probably on automatic pilot, but I think he'll think twice before he is so airily dismissive or uses that term again. Tina",

I haven't been on treatment yet that would cause hair loss, but a while ago I accompanied a friend who was just starting chemo to a wig store that had been recommended by her oncologist, and that gave big discounts to cancer patients. We spent a good chunk of the day there among very friendly salespeople finding a wig that was just right.They cut and styled it to match my friend's hair almost exactly, so that when it fell out during treatment no one could see any difference. She didn't have any major issues wearing the wig, just a bit of itching which she found tolerable. When her hair started to grow back, she stopped wearing the wig and got tons of compliments on her curlier, lighter new \"do\" from people who never had a clue that she'd had chemo or cancer.",

I have resisted doing this for a while, and have tried conservative treatments. I finally realize that my condition is not going to improve and admit that it is steadily worsening. I am sick of feeling like I'm old and sick, of not being able to do what I want to--- like walk or stand for any length of time, climb stairs and hills, bicycle, dance, ride horseback and ice skate. Maybe the last two are not realistic wishes with an artificial joint, but I know the others are.  I plan to visit two orthopedic surgeons--both reputable hip specialists--within the next weeks and make a choice between them.

Know Thyself Department: While I look forward to the experiencing the benefits of being bionic, I am trepidacious about many aspects of the surgery and recuperation. I have a long time to research the heck out of the subject to give myself some feeling of control, get really nervous, face down my myriad fears (infection, blood clots, dependence on others, dislocation), then try to put it all in perspective and assume the best outcome.  (I have finally realized that this has always been my process.  There was no Internet when I was first diagnosed with BC back in 1985. I researched modified radical mastectomy and immediate reconstruction in the library at Georgetown University, where I was indistinguishable from the med students. I also called the redoubtable Rose Kushner, author and pioneering advocate for women with breast cancer, who was a friend of an older friend. Armed with as much information as I could gather, I went back to my surgeon with questions. His response was an exasperated: \"Tina, you're impossible!\"  Then he smiled slightly and answered my questions. Apparently a young woman being informed in those days was tantamount to being impossible.) Anyway, that's enough. Blah, blah, blah. And blah!

Now you need to find a way to get some psychic and physical relief from the 24/7 strain. Your post moved me to tears. When I was a teenager, some of my younger brothers had problems with depression (understandable given our unpredictably violent father) which manifested themselves in persistent truancy. Although they did nothing but refuse to go to school, they were eventually made wards of the court and sent to juvenile detention facilities. There were no places for them to go for treatment at the time. And fathers ruled the roost in those days. My mother was unable to do more than visit my brothers every chance she was permitted and write letters to them every day. I see her dedication and love reflected in what you are doing. My brothers somehow got through it and finally emerged into adulthood as functional, coping people. One just died a few years ago. In his effects I found every letter my mom wrote him while he was in the facility.In her effects I found every letter he wrote to her. Your son is getting the expert medical attention and treatment he needs. I know you won't ever give up, but please find a way to be there for him while you keep your energy and strength.  Big hugs, Tina",

Said ribbon has been ripped off umpteen times to promote all sorts of causes. I can't get too exercised about this, maybe because I spent my career in advertising and marketing.  Pharmaceutical companies are in business to make a profit, just as all companies are. While the list prices of many cancer drugs are unconscionable, the cost of developing drugs is astronomical. The marketplace is brutally competitive and--yes--unfortunately the patients are often the last to be considered.  AstraZeneca makes several drugs for the treatment of cancer, one of which has kept mine stable since I was diagnosed with Stage IV breast cancer two-and-a-half years ago. I'm not defending the company's marketing tactics, just trying to point out that nothing is black and white, least of all the business of cancer diagnosis and treatment. Tina",

I make appointments in person with one of the receptionists, who is always friendly and efficient and greets me by name.  My Faslodex injections are always out and ready when I arrive. My own oncologist always examines me, asks if I have questions and periodically hands me Rxs for scans and I do the rest, selecting the hospital, arranging the apointments, etc.  At each office appointment, I pick up the blood test reports from the previous month. I'm certain that I could reach my oncologist or nurse if I need to ask anything between treatments. Sometimes I wish I were being cared for in a hospital with its many seeming advantages, but then I remember the lost-in-the-shuffle drawbacks I experienced when I had my many surgeries long ago at a large teaching institution, and the recent issues I've had getting reports from the hospitals where I must get scans, and I'm grateful to be a in a small oncology practice.",

      "Content": "Tina2 wrote: All, Does this report anger you as much as it does me? Tina New York Times Sept. 8, 2018 By Charles Ornstein and Katie Thomas, This article was reported and written in a collaboration with ProPublica, the nonprofit investigative journalism organization. One of the world's top breast cancer doctors failed to disclose millions of dollars in payments from drug and health care companies in recent years, omitting his financial ties from dozens of research articles in prestigious publications like The New England Journal of Medicine and The Lancet. The researcher, Dr. José Baselga, a towering figure in the cancer world, is the chief medical officer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. He has held board memberships or advisory roles with Roche and Bristol-Myers Squibb, among other corporations, has had a stake in start-ups testing cancer therapies, and played a key role in the development of breakthrough drugs that have revolutionized treatments for breast cancer. According to an analysis by The New York Times and ProPublica, Dr. Baselga did not follow financial disclosure rules set by the American Association for Cancer Research when he was president of the group. He also left out payments he received from companies connected to cancer research in his articles published in the group's journal, Cancer Discovery. At the same time, he has been one of the journal's two editors in chief. At a conference this year and before analysts in 2017, he put a positive spin on the results of two Roche-sponsored clinical trials that many others considered disappointments, without disclosing his relationship to the company. Since 2014, he has received more than $3 million from Roche in consulting fees and for his stake in a company it acquired. Dr. Baselga did not dispute his relationships with at least a dozen companies. In an interview, he said the disclosure lapses were unintentional. He stressed that much of his industry work was publicly known although he declined to provide payment figures from his involvement with some biotech startups. \"I acknowledge that there have been inconsistencies, but that's what it is,\" he said. \"It's not that I do not appreciate the importance.\" Dr. Baselga's extensive corporate relationships \u2014 and his frequent failure to disclose them \u2014 illustrate how permeable the boundaries remain between academic research and industry, and how weakly reporting requirements are enforced by the medical journals and professional societies charged with policing them. A decade ago, a series of scandals involving the secret influence of the pharmaceutical industry on drug research prompted the medical community to beef up its conflict-of-interest disclosure requirements. Ethicists worry that outside entanglements can shape the way studies are designed and medications are prescribed to patients, allowing bias to influence medical practice. Disclosing those connections allows the public, other scientists and doctors to evaluate the research and weigh potential conflicts. \"If leaders don't follow the rules, then we don't really have rules,\" said Dr. Walid Gellad, director of the Center for Pharmaceutical Policy and Prescribing at the University of Pittsburgh. \"It says that the rules don't matter.\" The penalties for such ethical lapses are not severe. The cancer research group, the A.A.C.R., warns authors who fill out disclosure forms for its journals that they face a three-year ban on publishing if they are found to have financial relationships that they did not disclose. But the ban is not included in the conflict-of-interest policy posted on its website, and the group said no author had ever been barred. Many journals and professional societies do not check conflicts and simply require authors to correct the record. Officials at the A.A.C.R., the American Society of Clinical Oncology and The New England Journal of Medicine said they were looking into Dr. Baselga's omissions after inquiries from The New York Times and ProPublica. The Lancet declined to say whether it would look into the matter. Christine Hickey, a spokeswoman for Memorial Sloan Kettering, said that Dr. Baselga had properly informed the hospital of his outside industry work and that it was Dr. Baselga's responsibility to disclose such relationships to entities like medical journals. The cancer center, she said, \"has a rigorous and comprehensive compliance program in place to promote honesty and objectivity in scientific research.\" Asked if he planned to correct his disclosures, Dr. Baselga asked reporters what they would recommend. In a statement several days later, he said he would correct his conflict-of-interest reporting for 17 articles, including in The New England Journal of Medicine, The Lancet and the publication he edits, Cancer Discovery. He said that he did not believe disclosure was required for dozens of other articles detailing early stages of research. \"I have spent my career caring for cancer patients and bringing new therapies to the clinic with the goal of extending and saving lives,\" Dr. Baselga said in the statement. \"While I have been inconsistent with disclosures and acknowledge that fact, that is a far cry from compromising my responsibilities as a physician, as a scientist and as a clinical leader.\" The corporate imprint on cancer research Dr. Baselga, 59, supervises clinical operations at Memorial Sloan Kettering, one of the nation's top cancer centers, and wields influence over the lives of patients and companies wishing to conduct trials there. He was paid more than $1.5 million in compensation by the cancer center in 2016, according to the hospital's latest available tax disclosures, but that does not include his consulting or board fees from outside companies. Many top medical researchers have ties to the for-profit health care industry, and some overlap is seen as a good thing \u2014 after all, these are the companies charged with developing the drugs, medical devices and diagnostic tests of the future. Dr. Baselga's relationship to industry is extensive. In addition to sitting on the board of Bristol-Myers Squibb, he is a director of Varian Medical Systems, which sells radiation equipment and for whom Memorial Sloan Kettering is a client. In all, Dr. Baselga has served on the boards of at least six companies since 2013, positions that have required him to assume a fiduciary responsibility to protect the interests of those companies, even as he oversees the cancer center's medical operations. The hospital and Dr. Baselga said steps had been taken to prevent him from having a say in any business between the cancer center and the companies on whose boards he sits. The chief executive of Memorial Sloan Kettering, Dr. Craig B. Thompson, settled lawsuits several years ago that were filed by the University of Pennsylvania and an affiliated research center. They contended that he hid research conducted while he was at Penn to start a new company, Agios Pharmaceuticals, and did not share the earnings. Dr. Thompson disputed the allegations. He now sits on the board of Merck, which manufactures Keytruda, a blockbuster cancer therapy. Ms. Hickey said the cancer center cannot fulfill its charitable mission without working with industry. \"We encourage collaboration and are proud that our work has led to the approval of novel, lifesaving cancer treatments for patients around the world,\" she said. Some disclosures are required; others aren't After the scandals a decade ago over lack of disclosure, the federal government began requiring drug and device manufacturers to publicly disclose payments to doctors in 2013. From August 2013 through 2017, Dr. Baselga received nearly $3.5 million from nine companies, according to the federal Open Payments database, which compiles disclosures filed by drug and device companies. Dr. Baselga has disclosed in other forums investments and advisory roles in biotech start-ups, but he declined to provide a tally of financial interests in those firms. Companies that have not received approval from the Food and Drug Administration for their products \u2014 projects still in the testing phases \u2014 do not have to report payments they make to doctors. Serving on boards can be lucrative. In 2017, he received $260,000 in cash and stock awards to sit on Varian's board of directors, according to the company's corporate filings. ProPublica and The Times analyzed Dr. Baselga's publications in medical journals since 2013, the year he joined Memorial Sloan Kettering. He failed to disclose any industry relationships in more than 100, or about 60 percent of the time, a figure that has increased with each passing year. Last year, he did not list any potential conflicts in 87 percent of the articles that he wrote or co-wrote. Dr. Baselga compiled a color-coded list of his articles and offered a different interpretation. Sixty-two of the papers for which he did not disclose any potential conflict represented \"conceptual, basic laboratory or translational work,\" and did not require one, he said. Questions could be raised about others, he said, but he added that most \"had no clinical nor financial implications.\" That left the 17 papers he plans to correct. Early-stage research often carries financial weight because it helps companies decide whether to move ahead with a product. In about two-thirds of Dr. Balsega's articles that lacked details of his industry ties, one or more of his co-authors listed theirs. In 2015, Dr. Baselga published an article in the New England Journal about a Roche-sponsored trial of one of the company's drugs, Zelboraf. Despite his financial ties to Roche, he declared that he had \"nothing to disclose.\" Fourteen of his co-authors reported ties to Roche. Dr. Baselga defended the articles, saying that \"these are high-quality manuscripts reporting on important clinical trials that led to a better understanding of cancer treatments.\" Industry Connections Some of Dr. José Baselga's known relationships with health care companies.

Note: Dr. Baselga worked with these companies at different times. Former relationships are marked with a *. The guidelines enacted by most major medical journals and professional societies ask authors and presenters to list recent financial relationships that could pose a conflict. But much of this reporting still relies on the honor system. A study in August in the journal JAMA Oncology found that one-third of authors in a sample of cancer trials did not report all payments from the studies' sponsors. \"We don't routinely check because we don't have those kind of resources,\" said Dr. Rita F. Redberg, the editor of JAMA Internal Medicine, who has been critical of the influence of industry on medical practice. \"We rely on trust and integrity. It's kind of an assumed part of the professional relationship.\" Jennifer Zeis, a spokeswoman for The New England Journal of Medicine, said in an email that it had now asked Dr. Baselga to amend his disclosures. She said the journal planned to overhaul its tracking of industry relationships. The American Association for Cancer Research said it had begun an \"extensive review\" of the disclosure forms submitted by Dr. Baselga. It said that it had never barred an author from publishing, and that \"such an action would be necessary only in cases of egregious, consistent violations of the rules.\" Among the most prominent relationships that Dr. Baselga has often failed to disclose is with the Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche and its United States subsidiary Genentech. In June 2017, at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago, Dr. Baselga spoke at a Roche-sponsored investor event about study results that the company had been counting on to persuade oncologists to move patients from Herceptin \u2014 which was facing competition from cheaper alternatives \u2014 to a combination treatment involving Herceptin and a newer, more expensive drug, Perjeta. The results were so underwhelming that Roche's stock fell 5 percent on the news. One analyst described the results as a \"lead balloon,\" and an editorial in The New England Journal called it a \"disappointment.\" Dr. Baselga, however, told analysts that critiques were \"weird\" and \"strange.\" This June, at the same cancer conference, Dr. Baselga struck an upbeat note about the results of a Roche trial of the drug taselisib, saying in a blog post published on the cancer center website that the results were \"incredibly exciting\" while conceding the side effects from the drug were high. That same day, Roche announced it was scrapping plans to develop the drug. The news was another disappointment involving the class of drugs called PI3K inhibitors, which is a major focus of Dr. Baselga's current research. In neither case did Dr. Baselga reveal that his ties to Roche and Genentech went beyond serving as a trial investigator. In 2014, Roche acquired Seragon, a cancer research company in which Dr. Baselga had an ownership stake, for $725 million. Dr. Baselga received more than $3 million in 2014 and 2015 for his stake in the company, according to the federal Open Payments database. From 2013 to 2017, Roche also paid Dr. Baselga more than $50,000 in consulting fees, according to the database. These details were not included in the conflict-of-interest statements that are required of all presenters at the American Society of Clinical Oncology conference, although he did disclose ownership interests and consulting relationships with several other companies in the prior two years. ASCO said it would conduct an internal review of Dr. Baselga's disclosures and would refer the findings to a panel. Dr. Baselga said that he played no role in the Seragon acquisition, and that he had cut ties with Roche since joining the board of a competitor, Bristol-Myers, in March. As for his presentations at the ASCO meetings in the last two years, he said he had also noted shortcomings in the studies. The combination of Perjeta with Herceptin was later approved by the F.D.A. for certain high-risk patients. As for taselisib, Dr. Baselga stands by his belief that the PI3K class of drugs will be an important target for fighting cancer. Charles Ornstein is a senior editor at ProPublica.

Our next cats, litter mates, didn't live nearly as long. They all had distinct, interesting personalities. We kept them indoors. One was never the same after her sister died. When she died, we decided not to adopt another kitty because of travel and other considerations, but we certainly miss having one or two around. Sometimes I see something out of the corner my eye and think, \"Oh, there's (name) !\" So does my partner. Then we get sad all over again I can't imagine taking a cat on a trampoline or a slide!

My gyn put me on Fosamax many years ago (pre Stage IV) when my DEXAs started showing osteopenia. I had no problems with it, but my PCP took me off it after five years, saying she didn't think it was necessary. Some news media had accused the makers of Fosamax of creating a market for its drug by hyping osteopenia as a medical condition that required treatment. The news about jaw issues and other possible SEs of long-term use was just coming out. Since then, I have been a faithful consumer of calcium supplements (more recently those with Vitamin D) and still have only osteopenia. My onc is starting me on Prolia next month in the hope that it may help ward off bone mets. Tina",

While the anxiety did not paralyze me, it did cause sleep problems and irritability, and compulsive research distracted me from other things I was supposed to be doing. I tried talk therapy for a while and that helped, just blah-blah-blahing to someone who understood about all the nasty aspects of being Stage IV. I'd taken two varieties of antidepressants and one anti-anxiety med in the distant past. For many reasons, I did not want to take them now. However, after I white-knucked through an MRI some months ago, I asked my onc for an Rx for Ativan. I take it only pre-scan, but I love knowing it's there in the cabinet if I need it.  It's important for newbies who are reading this to realize that the passing of time has done wonders in diminishing my initial anxiety, and my current status of virtually NED has helped keep it at bay. I hasten to add that this approach to coping is what has worked for me so far. It could change at any time. I firmly believe in \"better living through chemistry\" for anyone who needs it! Tina",

Coming in here to defend her organization was indefensible (not to mention foolhardy), true, but we can help diminish such occurences in the future by being cautious with the wording of our subject lines. Anyone can see what we post; all they have to do is join and troll around. That's the risk we take by communicating this way.

Just read about this trial on Johns Hopkins' Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center web page: Psychopharmacology of psilocybin in cancer patients Protocol Number: J0647 Phase: Pilot Physician: Roland Griffiths Purpose: Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine is seeking volunteers with a diagnosis of cancer who are experiencing anxious or depressed mood to participate in a scientific study of states of consciousness brought about by the entheogen psilocybin, a psychoactive substance found in mushrooms used as a sacrament in some cultures, given in a comfortable, supportive setting. Eligibility: - high school level of education - 21 to 70 years old - have a cancer diagnosis that is potentially life-threatening and with the disease progressing within 1 year prior to study entry, as judged by the referring physician. - have an ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2. - experiencing symptoms of depression or anxiety related to cancer diagnosis - be between cancer therapies or have independently decided to not undergo direct cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation, for at least an approximately 1 month duration - good liver function - no cancer with known CNS involvement, or other major CNS disease. - no major cardiovascular conditions or epilepsy - no females who are pregnant or nursing - other medical and psychiatric exclusions may apply Treatment: Questionnaires and interviews will be used to assess the effects of psilocybin on consciousness, mood, and behavior. Volunteers enrolled in the study will receive careful preparation and 2 outpatient sessions in which they will receive psilocybin. Structured guidance will be provided during the session and afterwards to facilitate integration of the experiences.

The voice-over narrator introduced each episode by intoning \"There are eight-million stories in the Naked City. This is just one of them.\" Here's mine: I was diagnosed Stage I in 1985 and Stage I again in 1995. These were two primaries, with no lymph node involvement. In each case, I had a mastectomy with reconstruction; adjuvant therapy was deemed unnecessary both times. In 2007 I had a CT scan of my lungs because two of my younger brothers had just died of lung cancer at very early ages. I had no symptoms, but was concerned. Nodules showed up on my scan. (This is very common.)  My pulmonologist watched these nodules over subsequent years of annual scans, and most of them disappeared. One remained and stayed stable until this spring, when it started to grow. A biopsy in July confirmed the nodule as metastatic breast cancer, a diagnosis that blew away everyone involved, including the radiologist. My point for you with this long-winded tale is that one can go for years with mets and no symptoms. I'm living proof!",

I recently found an advanced cancer support group for women run bi-monthly by a very large teaching hospital in the area. It took me an hour and a half to get there in rush hour traffic, then 30 minutes more to get my car parked in a crowded garage surrounded by construction, then 15 minutes more to walk to the building. The group was moved to another room on another floor halfway through the hour-long session, which was awkward. The social-worker leaders seemed highly competent, but the sessions are drop-in and this one was attended by only one other woman. I found the experience somewhat unsatisfying, but much better than being the only Stage IV person in the room. This is the only Stage IV/metastasized cancer support group I have found in the entire Washington metro region. Because of the incredible hassle of getting there, I may or may not return. Wouldn't you think the Cancer Society or somesuch organization would perceive this growing need and attempt to fill it? It makes me wonder if we really are being \"written off,\" even by the medical profession. After all, who needs more moral and peer support than someone with Stage IV cancer?  Grateful for this forum, warts and all, Tina",

I am claustrophobic to a degree, but have always been able during previous scans to will myself into a sort of zen state. Not this time.  The tech said something through the machine noise that I thought was \" Five minutes more\" and when far more than that time went by, I started to freak. I know that it doesn't make sense, but I thought she had forgotten me and gone out to have lunch or a vacation. I called out. It took her several of my calls to respond. She stopped the scan, then told me she had actually said something like, \"In  five more minutes, we will focus on blah dee blah.\" That's when I realized I needed to have something calming on scan days. Take the drugs. Keep your eyes closed. Try to separate yourself from where you are. The advice above to ask that they not inform you of every view is very sensible. I like the breathing and the towel over the eyes ideas too.  Whatever works! Tina, about to take her first lorazepam/s tomorrow pre PET-CT",

(I had stopped seeing him previously after being ostensibly cured of Stage I cancer.) He advised I see a surgeon and I ended up having a parotidectomy. The tumor was benign, as most parotid tumors are. Unfortunately, if they keep growing, they can affect the facial nerve and cause paralysis. One good aspect of the episode was that the slow healing of the incision on my neck caused me to finally quit a decades-long smoking habit. Good luck! PM me if you have questions. Just remember I had this surgery a long time ago and approaches to such things very likely have changed. Tina",

They are now mere shells and shadows of their former selves, rendered metabolically inactive by treatment with an anti-hormonal, Faslodex.  The largest nodule was finally biopsied when it was seen to grow on scans. I had been getting scanned via CT annually for many years to monitor an array of lung nodules, many of which had resolved over time. The pulmonologist who had been following me advised a lobectomy after several remaining  nodules glowed on a PET scan until I insisted that there must be something less invasive. The resultant needle biopsy was expected to reveal lung cancer or some benign condition. Instead it showed metasticized breast cancer. Needless to say, my pulmonologist, who knew of my breast cancer history, is no longer my pulmonologist. And I scooted back to my former oncologist from my most recent days of being Stage I, back in 1995. So, yes, your biopsy is essential. And yes, here is someone with--not just one--but only several mets in my lungs and none (detectible) elsewhere. Tina",

Does that mean they get to charge twice as much as they did before? Probably, but I'm too cynical/resigned/tired to investigate.

No pun intended, but that is really the pits. As for the skull mets, I have no experience, but I trust that others here will weigh in with suggestions. Happy holidays to you, too. I hope the pain subsides and I'm glad you don't have to wait too long for that MRI. Tina",

I know from several experiences through dealing with hospice that they can do wonders with medications and combinations of medications that can make you more comfortable and, yes, even more functional. They are experts at formulating the right balance for each patient. if I were you I would not guess at what my Medical Oncologist thinks; I would ask her directly. And I would definitely ask your Neuro Oncologist how he envisions hospice helping you. Big hug, Julie! Tina",

There are a couple of new cysts in my liver and a couple of old cysts in my kidneys. An unfinished sentence in the report begins \"No significant bony...\" I'm annoyed by the sloppiness of this error, but since whatever it is is not \"significant,\" I won't get too worked up. Oh, and I have \" a hip prosthesis.\" Now there's a surprise! The radiologist's concluding \"impression\" is \"No definite metastatic deposits are seen.\" I realize that these reports are often written with CYA firmly in mind, but was that qualifier \"definite\" really necessary? And what's with \"deposits?\" Have any of you encountered this terminology? Tina   ",

At least you have kept your sense of humor. Hang on! Moira, be sure to let us know what your doctor says about your \"fat neck.\" I discovered the very same thing several months ago, thinking, \"Yikes! Did I always have that big knot at the top of my spine?\" I asked my onc about it, joking that perhaps it was the beginning of the dreaded \"dowager's hump.\" He felt it and said, \"Wellll....\" to the point where I thought , \"Oh no, I'm going to have a hump,\" and then he said that it might be Paget's disease because I apparently have that in my skull. And that it was no big deal. Ai yi yi. Sometimes it's amazing to me that any of us have a shred of sanity left.",

It's due to more stringent guidelines and hassles related to insurance coverage as well as concerns about excessive radiation exposure. I had scans every three months when I was first diagnosed with lung mets in 2011. When they stopped growing and began to shrink, my onc switched my PET-CT schedule to about every six months. I am on an annual scanning schedule now because all subsequent scans have revealed no metabolic activity in the mets or any other areas suspicious for metastasis. I have no doubt that my doctor would call for a scan if symptoms indicated a change or if anything came up in a blood test, as will yours. Congrats on four years with NED! Tina ",

On Death, Without Exaggeration By Wislawa Szymborska It can't take a joke, find a star, make a bridge. It knows nothing about weaving, mining, farming, building ships, or baking cakes. In our planning for tomorrow, it has the final word, which is always beside the point. It can't even get the things done that are part of its trade: dig a grave, make a coffin, clean up after itself. Preoccupied with killing, it does the job awkwardly, without system or skill. As though each of us were its first kill. Oh, it has its triumphs, but look at its countless defeats, missed blows, and repeat attempts! Sometimes it isn't strong enough to swat a fly from the air. Many are the caterpillars that have outcrawled it. All those bulbs, pods, tentacles, fins, tracheae, nuptial plumage, and winter fur show that it has fallen behind with its halfhearted work. Ill will won't help and even our lending a hand with wars and coups d'etat is so far not enough. Hearts beat inside eggs. Babies' skeletons grow. Seeds, hard at work, sprout their first tiny pair of leaves and sometimes even tall trees fall away. Whoever claims that it's omnipotent is himself living proof that it's not. There's no life that couldn't be immortal if only for a moment. Death always arrives by that very moment too late. In vain it tugs at the knob of the invisible door.
