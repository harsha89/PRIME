I have had mets diease since 2001. Cancer moved to my liver. Tamoxifen worked for many years. Started xeloda in 2009 when things started acting up again. The hand foot side effects were bothersome but doable. After 6months, I started abraxene which worked for about 7 months? Then I enrolled in a trial for cytoxan (spelling) and eribulin. My tumors shrank at first but more important, over time, they didn't increase in size and strength. During all this my life was always active and side effects minimal. But after 18 months of no hair, I started to get down and approached my doctors. It was then that I was told about the afinitor/aromasin combination. After 3 months of treatment (I started in Oct 2012) my tumors decreased significantly in size and strength (my doctor calls it the glow factor). I take 10 mg of afinitor Mon thru Friday, 5mg on weekends. 25mg aromasin every day. I tolerate the mouth sores but at times, it gets bad. I was given a mouth rinse for them but misunderstood and learned I need to use 3times a day (not when I get one). I continue to live a very active life and finally I have hair again: a cute short boy cut which I love. Being that I have lived with mets for over 12 years, I hope this gives someone out there HOPE.",
