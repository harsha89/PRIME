So sorry that you have joined this club, but we are a bunch of fighters! Get ready to gear up girlfriend. Waiting is the worst part and keeping busy will help you. Great idea about the file folder. I am making a scrapbook of everything, writing in a journal and starting a caringbridge site. Have you shared your diagnosis with family and friends yet? Stay positive and I know its hard but try not to do so much internet research. All the information can be overwhelming and truly hard to understand. Everyone's cancer isn't the same. Everyone's treatment regimen isn't the same and everyone's side effects aren't the same. Just try to remain calm. Welcome to your new normal. Your life will forever be touched by cancer but it isn't the end, its the beginning.",

In my heart of heart I knew it would be cancer. Was still takenback hearing the news but just had a feeling it would be. The results if sent to pathology should take 72 hours give or take weekends into consideration. Mines was done on a Wednesday and I received the results on a Monday. So try not to worry and relax.

The tumor in the right breast is benign. But just knowing it's there makes me decision to get a bilateral mastectomy much easier. First I debated but now I'm sure.
