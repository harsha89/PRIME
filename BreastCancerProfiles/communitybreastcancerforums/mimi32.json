I was TERRIFIED to tell my children. Afraid that I would say something wrong or that I would cry but I wanted them to see that I am \"ok\". I didn't want them to hear from someone else but me so my husband and I talked to them together. We explained that the tests I had done showed that mommy has breast cancer. We also told them that I would be having my breasts removed and getting new ones. My situation in talking to my kids is a little different. My mother in law has had both her breasts removed with no reconstruction. They are very aware of this so I was able to \"compare\" myself to her as in look at mama she did this and she's perfectly healthy (the healthiest 70 year old I know). I am very open and honest with my kids. I can tell you that the conversation was nothing like I feared, AT ALL! I wouldn't say it went exactly as I would have pictured it to go. Once I gave them the information I let them ask all the questions they wanted. I tried not to make it a \"serious talk\" because I didn't want to frighten them. It was a very light hearted conversation. I will tell you that they will ask more questions later than they will at first. I pray that you find the words your searching for to talk to your children.",

Let us know how the genetic testing goes. CJ - My pre opp appointment is on the same day. Have you found information to help you in your research about sizes, types.... of implants. So much to consume in such little time. Nancyjeanne - the information on these boards has been a life saver for me. I have learned things I otherwise would not have known. It's given me the ability to ask questions and better advocate for my own health. jmfrankel - I know what you mean. It's disheartening that we all have to \"meet\" this way but having someone to talk to that is going through this is comforting. My family and friends have been extremely supportive but its hard to truly understand the emotions and fears unless you're walking the same path.",

It stinks that we have to be here but it certainly helps to know we have a place to go where someone is going through and feeling the same way we are. I had my 2 week pre op appointment with the PS yesterday. The doctor addressed all the questions and concerns that I had before I even needed to ask. Appointment days are usually pretty emotional days for me so I try to preoccupy myself. I had a great dinner with my husband and my mother in law. A glass of wine (or two), great food and great company was just what I needed yesterday. Each passing day brings surgery that much closer. To say I'm not scared out of my mind would be a lie but I am sooo very ready to have surgery done and move on.",

I needed to be in a place that I could rest in peace in quiet. My ps was hesitant to send me home with the level of pain I was in after transferring to oral meds instead of the IV. I explained that I would not be alone so he said I could go. I must say that I have been in ALOT of pain. It's more of a constant sharp heaviness. (No clue if that makes sense). When I transferred to oral meds we had a hard time getting my pain under control. After almost 24 hours of taking pain meds every 2 hours (around the clock alternating between Percocet, muscle relaxer and IB) I am finally comfortable. I was not able to sleep in bed, our bed lifts like a hospital bed to so I'm not sure why but I found myself comfortable in the recliner. My wonderful daughter came home from college to take care of me. She slept on the couch in the same room and woke up every 2 hours to give me my meds. We made a list of what meds I need to take at what time and set an alarm on my phone. I noticed there are a few new people here. Please give me a few days to get your names added to the list. Good luck to all of you coming up on surgery and to those that have already had surgery I hope you are healing well. (Sorry I am still kinda out of it) Mimi32",

They want to wean me off the narcotics because of my issues with constipation so I am alternating between percocet and ibuprofen every 4 hours. I was in a little more pain yesterday trying to adjust to the new medication schedule. Hopefully we can get this constipation under control. They took my steristrips off as well. I did not look at my incisions because I wanted to share that moment with my husband. He continues to think that everything looks fantastic and his positive attitude helps me maintain my positive thoughts as well. I think that I am afraid of how I will feel when I come face to face with the image in the mirror. I was horrified when I saw my incision from my lumpectomy.

I think it's partly due to this burning sensation I get when I eat/drink anything cold or hot. It burns all the way down when I swallow and then sends an excruciating pain across my whole chest. It sometimes takes my breath away and brings tears to my eyes. I recently found a thread here and I here it's pretty common. I force myself to eat at least 2 meals a day so I can try to keep up on my nutrition. Has anyone else had this sensation? jmfrankel - I was given a surgical bra when I was discharged that I was told I had to wear 24/7 while I have drains (crossing my fingers the last 2 come out tomorrow) I am planning on wearing a bandeau/tube top under my shirts for support. I have a couple sports bras that I may try as well. I'm not sure about showers as I still have drains and can only sponge bath but hopefully that changes tomorrow. Are any of you allowed to shave your armpits or use deodorant yet? I am still dependent on my pain meds? I hate taking medication and don't on a regular basis. Have any of you been able to reduce your pain meds or stop taking them? tae - I still have not looked at myself in the mirror. I just don't feel I am ready yet. Maybe afraid of how I will feel or how it will impact my emotional state. I have looked down and can see my incisions but I ams till afraid of the whole picture. Hugs to you!

Somedays are better than others but I wonder if the cold weather is contributing to the tightness (it's 15º here). Sometimes I feel like I just want these things out! I wonder if I can/want to go through this for months! Last night was one of those times I was ready to throw in the towel. I have stood in front of the mirror and wondered if I would be ok without reconstruction. My feelings on that waiver tremendously so I know that I am doing the right thing no matter how frustrated I feel. I just keep reminding myself that there is a light at the end of the tunnel and I won't feel this forever. I'm only at 160cc's so I have a long way to go!! I pray that God gives me the strength and courage to conquer this step. My husband and I are headed to Florida for our anniversary next week so I'm looking forward to that much needed time away!

My Dr's warned me that many people go through a period of feeling depressed and it usually sets in around 3-4 weeks post op. I have carried a very positive attitude from the beginning. Through testing, diagnosis, surgeries and recovery I held my head high and won every battle with the \"self pity\" emotions that lingered to consume me. Friends and family kept telling me that I had to allow myself to feel those feelings but I was so focused on getting through it and keeping my head on straight. If I'm being honest being anything but tough frightened me. Now here I am post surgery and one week after my first fill and I can feel myself starting to give into these emotions that I have been so determined not to feel. We are all going through a big deal, a HUGE deal. Our bodies are never going to be the same and our spirits will forever be changed (good or bad). Don't beat yourself up for allowing the emotions to run through you, in someways I think your braver than I am for doing so. You are strong and you will get through this.

It all came to a screeching halt after my first biopsy. Since June I have been on/off restrictions between surgeries. I plan to start training again as soon as I am permitted to do so which I know won't be until after exchange I think we all (at least a few of us) have reached a mental point where we are frustrated with the limitations we have whether they be placed by our doctors or our own physical healing. I think this is where the depression that my doctors warned me about starts to set in. There's nothing more depressing than not being able to do things for yourself and being stuck in the house. I try to focus on the positive. Focusing on the progress I have made no matter how big or small as helped me stay positive. Remind yourself that you will get there. We are all fighting one heck of a fight. I am so very grateful to have all of you. Though my friends and family are very supportive they haven't worn the same shoes. Be nice to yourself this is not an easy journey to walk.",

That was a tough decision for me as my PS and BS have both told me that I will likely not be a candidate for nipple reconstruction because I am thin and choosing to go bigger. From what my PS has told me he will be using the Mentor tissue expander as I have chosen to use Mentor implants. Other than choosing the brand I have no idea what I want but they told me I have plenty of time while going through fills to look at and touch different implants to help me decide. She said that they are their to help me choose whats best for me and mentioned the different dimensions they use to help achieve that. Its all been so overwhelming and the fear of making a wrong choice is sometimes very consuming but I have to trust in the doctors who are advising and taking care of me.

My husband and I were just talking about this last night as we were unsure if/what they may be. There's a lot of new \"faces\" here. Welcome to all of you! This board and this site has been a life saver for me. I believe I have added everyone to the surgery list if not please let me know. Now that all my drains are out I am allowed to drive. Well I decided to go to the grocery to pick up a couple things yesterday. OMG that was harder than I thought. Driving wasn't too bad, though I certainly wouldn't think about driving during rush hour. Pushing the cart was tough. Got a good pec muscle work out. I came home and crashed for 2 hours. I have started to wean myself off narcotics and am only taking tylenol. Percocet makes my brain so foggy and I don't remember much when I\"m on it. I hope everyone is feeling well and healing fast. Happy Thanksgiving to you and your families! We certainly have a lot to be thankful for",

I think this year more than ever Christmas to me was about the little things (like this story) and remembering that the gifts that are given each day in the love from my kids, my spouse, my family, my home, etc. are so much greater than any wrapped gifts under a tree.  I hope that everyone had a wonderful Christmas and is feeling well. I am headed for my 3rd fill today. My husband final gets to go to a fill with me so I'm super excited for him to see exactly how it's done.

I have my first appointment with my PS tomorrow and I'm hoping he will remove at least 2 of my 4 drains. Allebasi - I too drift off frequently. I was taking flexeral, percocet, stol softener and antibiotic. I am battling constipation so they want me to reduce my Percocet so I am alternating between that and Ibprofren every 4 hours. I have tried almost everything and still have not been able to go. Sunday I drank magnesium citrate (I think that's what it's called) nothing, hours later I used a suppository still nothing. I called my doctor yesterday and they told me to take milk of magnesia with mineral oil if nothing the first time try it again 5 hours later still nothing. So I am suppose to use an enema today. My belly is so bloated that I look like I'm pregnant. So between the increased pain from reducing my Percocet and the discomfort from being constipated I am a mess. My mother in law came in town till Wednesday. She is amazing! I am so blessed to have the relationship I do with her. She is a breast cancer survivor and also had double mastectomy (years apart). I think I have added all the new ladies to the list. If I have not added you please let me know.",

Still restricted to lifting no more than 5 pounds, no exercise besides post surgery, only light house work. hope you are all feeling well!",

I too feel like something is going to rip and the worst part is in my arm pit. I did not have any lymph nodes removed. Until my first fill everything was feeling so good. Since the day of my fill everything is very tight, pulls and is very uncomfortable even still 5 days later. I was only filled with 40cc's. Now that you have a reason for what maybe causing this feeling for you I hope your doctors or PT can resolve it and you can start to feel a little more comfortable.",

My PS told me to expect week by week and day by day to be different while going through the tissue expansion process. The past 2 days if have been exhausted! I took a nap yesterday, fell asleep on the couch at 7:45 slept till 7 this morning and took a nap before 10. I haven't' slept that much since the first couple weeks following surgery.  Have any of you started exercising again? What are your restrictions? ",

I have been having the same sensation that started a few days after surgery and thought it may be from the tubes they put down my throat but it isn't getting better so I was planning on talking to my dr at my post op appointment on Monday. Cold or hot liquids and sometimes food hurt like h***! I can feel them all the way down and then followed by a sharp pain that goes across my whole chest. It seems that Percocet relieves it so I try to drink/eat about an hour after taking my meds. I also drink water without ice not so tasty but it's better than dealing with the pain. So glad I'm not alone. Hope it gets better for you soon!",
