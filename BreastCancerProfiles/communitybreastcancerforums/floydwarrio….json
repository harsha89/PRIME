The past 4 weeks have been a flurry of doctor appointments each one getting worse news than the previous appointment. I have a 17 month old beautiful son Caden. As it turned out I had an invasive tumor 8 cm removed with 11/16 nodes positive. My PET scan though looked good. My family had a small party and toasted champagne I was Stage 3. I secretly wanted to cry, even though I knew stage 3 ruled stage 4 when they said cheers. You already hopefully feel the loving support around you...friends, family, and strangers alike. As horrible as it is you will never feel more alive and more connected to humanity and will see the amazing people around you in a way you never have before. Doctors will grow wings and appear as angels by your stretcher as you are wheeled into surgery. I have found great strength in Reiki, accupuncture, reading and writing in my journal. Tell people when you are comfortable, but realize your husband too has been diagnosed so listen to his needs. My husband insisted I run right over and tell my sisters (for him more than me). I'm glad I did and soon I told every single person I think I ever spoke to in my life (including the woman at Stewarts I saw every day). I completely belive in the power of prayer and the collective unconscious. Know you were chosen because this is the life path that has been presented to you...we are not weak people and it is quite an elite group of amazing women I have realized in my short 28 days.  Know it will be a rollercoaster ride- every hour. God is at the control and will give you wonderful signs along the way to let you know he's right here.  I have never been religious...until now. I will say a prayer for you tonight- good luck in your new journey in which you certainly are not alone. Love, FLOYDWARRIOR ",
