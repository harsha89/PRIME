    "Content": "soscaredhubby wrote: Hi everyone. My wife recently had a double mastectomy with nodes taken on both sides. The right side was negative, so they didn't take very many nodes. The left side was positive, so they ended up taking more than they originally planned. Obviously we are concerned about lymphedema. I know she could get it on either side, but is it safe to have blood drawn/shots/blood pressure given on the right side? She is right handed so it concerns us, but the left side is more at risk. I was also wondering what the statistics are that she will develop lymphedema? Is it likelihood that she develops this high for the left side? Thank you for any comments/advice.
