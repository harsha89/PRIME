I shower in warm(not hot) water and use a unscented moisturizing soap. I don't rub my skin dry. I'm not using any lotions, scents & use a natural deodorant that has never given me trouble before & has been approved by the radiation techs. My husband looked and saw a little bit (and I mean little bit) of discoloration near the nipple. Right around the bra line I have a patch of red, irritated & itchy skin. There are 5 raised dots that look like pimples. My bras (non-underwire) have never done this. Can skin irritation start this early? I'm incredibly upset right now. For someone who was the perfect candidate for a lumpectomy, I've had just about everything go wrong - hematoma, a HUGE abscess, months of packing my wound, severe constipation & nausea/vomiting so bad I lost 23 pounds in 4 weeks, etc. I was so hoping this would be the normal amount of cancer suckage & not extra on top. Thanks for any advice. Log in to post a reply",

There's no way that this could be happening from the radiation so soon. Meanwhile, it's still there but I didn't wear a bra today (I HATE doing this) & it's less apparent but still there. I've never had any kind of yeast infection or irritation like this along my bra line, no matter how hot or sweaty I was. I don't have sensitive skin. I see both my radiologist & his nurse tomorrow. Meanwhile the techs were very sweet and gave me Miaderm to use. They also recommended over the counter hydrocortisone cream. And thank you for the advice and not treating me like I'm nuts. I KNOW skin irritation isn't supposed to show up for weeks. But nothing else in this whole cancer process has been 'normal' for me. I felt silly even bringing it up at my treatment today, but I'm still glad I advocated for myself.",
