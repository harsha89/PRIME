I was told that the radiologists are there at certain times and all they do is read mammograms and then meet with you while you're there. She said that they schedule this type of appointment when there is something suspicious so that the radiologist can look at it right away and order more testing if they feel it's necessary. She said the radiologist may want to do another ultrasound since the last one wasn't done in their office. I was also told that they really don't like doing a mammogram on someone under the age of 30 (6 months away), but I appreciated that she was going to find out if they would rather do a different test like an MRI, she said why have a mammogram if there's something that the radiologist felt would be better for me. So I will be getting a call back about if they will do the mammogram or some other test, but I do have a mammogram scheduled for next Thursday as of right now.  Did anyone have an MRI instead of a mammogram? ",

About a week ago, I felt a sharp pain behind my nipple, it was almost like someone stabbed me-I really don't know how to describe it besides that. It was quick but I've never felt anything like it before.  Also, at my last appointment the NP pushed down and put pressure on the top, middle, and bottom outer part of my breast and I almost jumped off the table because it hurt so bad that I almost screamed (the left was uncomfortable but nothing in comparison to the right where the lump is located). Did anyone experience that? Or know why that hurt so badly? It scared me but the NP wouldn't say anything about why it was so painful on the right and not the left. ",

At first he had trouble feeling the lump but when he put more pressure on the skin, he could feel that it was not toward the surface of the skin. He did another ultrasound and he pushed down harder than the first ultrasound I had, he showed me on the screen what the lump looked like. He said it looked like fibrocystic changes. He mentioned that a mammogram was a possibility but he didn't \"think\" it was really needed. He also said he wasn't sure that it was fibrocystic changes and the only way to know for sure what the lump is-is to do a biopsy which would remove the lump (I thought they usually do a biopsy with a needle and just take a sample to test? What would/could be the reason that he would suggest doing a biopsy to remove it rather than test a sample?) He said we could monitor the lump and sort of left things up in the air. I told him that I wanted him to order a mammogram so he did. He said after we get the results, we could discuss doing a biopsy.  I was happy that he ordered the mammogram but I didn't feel very reassured when he was telling me what he thought based on a guess without further testing. A guess is not medical evidence that will tell me what the lump actually is.  I don't know that much about breast conditions and I'm confused by all the terms he used. Advice? Suggestions? ",

I am 29 years old and I felt a lump sort of between my breast and armpit about the size of a pea in January. I found it and immediately made an appointment because I've never had any lumps before and I got worried. I went in for the appointment and the Nurse Practitioner immediately felt exactly what I was talking about and told me that she felt I needed to have an ultrasound to see what was going on because the lump was concerning to her. She had the doctor approve the ultrasound and their department called me within minutes to schedule an appointment ASAP. My initial appointment and ultrasound were at the beginning of February. Nothing showed up on the ultrasound but the tech felt the lump right away and she had the radiologist come in to see if she could find anything on the ultrasound. The radiologist felt the lump as well and she tried doing the ultrasound herself but nothing showed up for her. The NP emailed me right away and asked me to schedule an appointment after I had my period to see if the lump was cycle related. She also said it may be a cyst. I haven't been able to get back in until a few days ago. The lump is still there and the area is tender. The NP told me that she felt it would be best for me to see a general surgeon since they have better imaging and that is their specialty. Even though it sounded scary to see a surgeon, I wanted answers because of how long the lump has been there. She had to have the referral to send me to a surgeon approved by a Doctor and he refused to approve it. I was extremely frustrated and upset especially after what he told her. He said that I was too young for it to be anything (hopefully nothing is wrong) and I would basically be wasting their time, and since I had no family history, he wouldn't approve it. He asked that I come back and see him in 3 months (at which point it would be 8 months since I first felt the lump). I live in Colorado, does anyone know of any sort of breast center or could you tell me how to find that information? I have health insurance but I feel like I'm being denied proper health care and I'm scared. I'm being pushed aside and I don't know what to do. I don't have an insurance company where there are lots of doctors to choose from-I don't have United or anything like that, so I'm limited with who I can see. Does anyone have any advice? 29 years old Log in to post a reply",

I'm concerned about the clinical breast exam because the lump is sort of hard to feel because it's not right at the surface of the skin and it's located on my breast near my armpit and about the size of a pea (the NP I saw initially felt it, the radiologist and the tech, the NP felt it when I went back again but the gynecologist NP said she didn't really feel it but since the others had all noted that they did, she would send me to see the surgeon). I'm worried the surgeon will say they don't feel anything and that since the ultrasound a few months ago didn't show anything...they will just send me home. This lump was not here before January....I've just had to push so much to get this far and I deserve answers. If it's nothing, I need to know that so I can stop worrying...and if it's something, it needs to be treated accordingly. This is my health and my life! How does a biopsy work? Do they stick the needle into the lump to get a sample? Or the surrounding area? Since nothing showed up on the ultrasound, what do they use for testing? I was also told I have dense breasts and I've read mammograms aren't helpful if you have dense breasts, so what do they do in that situation? (Sorry for all the questions).  Thanks for your support. It is a huge help and I wish the best for you. ",

It's nice to know that there is a huge support system out there because I know I'm scared, and I have read a lot of helpful information on the discussion boards. I know that most lumps are not cancer but I will feel like I can breathe again when I have actual proof that it's nothing rather than some doctor's opinion. I am so frustrated by hearing doctors say that BC doesn't hurt, because as I've read on here it hurts for some people and not for others. I'm disgusted by the things I've heard doctors say throughout these past few months-you're too young, no family history=nothing to worry about. I can't believe that doctors send women home and tell them not to worry about their lump because nothing showed up on an ultrasound, along with their other dumb opinions like age and pain. My doctor tried to do this to me but I'm not the type of person to ignore something when I don't know what it is. I worry too much to just \"let it go\" like the doctors advise. No one should ever be discouraged from seeking medical attention when they find something of concern. It's better to find out now when you discover a change/concern what's going on rather than put it off and find out at a much later date that there is a big problem. I will let you know what happens on Thursday. ",

The surgeon told me to come back in a few months to be checked again and if the lump were to change, then a biopsy could be discussed again. I was so frustrated about this. The radiologist also said to the surgeon that I was too young-I am so sick of hearing that. I can't believe that they'd rather wait for the lump to change then to just remove it now. ",

I was so overwhelmed by everything and didn't even ask the important question of \"why?\" Are there any reasons that a needle biopsy can't be done-like the location of the lump or something? or because it is deeper under the skin?  K51, I am going to seek a second opinion because I am just not comfortable with what the surgeon said especially because he went from acting like he was taking me seriously to acting really cold because of the radiologist. I don't like to take a doctor's word for it when it just doesn't feel right because I've had medical issues in the past that I kept telling my doctor about and he kept telling me that there was nothing wrong....after a lot of persistence and not letting it go, he finally ordered testing and I was right and needed to have surgery. I definitely learned that if it doesn't feel right, you have to keep pushing until a doctor will finally listen.  I will keep you posted. Thank you all :)",

I think they're completely wrong about how they treat younger people because of their belief that they're \"too young.\" Cancer doesn't discriminate, and I pray it's B9 but I have a right to know. I was really angry that the surgeon changed his mind based on what the radiologist told him. He felt the lump and it came up on their US, but not the US in the imaging department. I don't understand why he changed like that because he was the one who said he wanted to do a biopsy to remove the whole lump at the first appointment. I didn't think it went that way either but for some odd reason-it happened. I felt like I was finally being listened to and taken seriously but I will just keep on going. The radiologist is the one who told me that because it doesn't show up on US, it's not there. I told her that there is a lump and every doctor including the surgeon could feel it. Does she think I just want to keep spending money on doctor's appointments and ultrasounds for no reason?! I'm trying to figure out what's going on.

The surgeon told me at the first appointment that it could be fibrocystic changes but he wasn't sure and that the only way to know for sure what was going on was to remove the whole lump. He said it would likely get rid of the tenderness and that when they find a lump, they like to remove it. When the surgeon did the ultrasound, as soon as he moved the wand over the lump, I could see the difference on the screen. He then told me that he found it and explained that based on its appearance, he wasn't too concerned that it was cancer. It definitely appeared different than when he moved the wand across other parts of my breast.  I may have to wait the 3 months, it depends what I can come up with the breast center but what's stressful for me is that the lump is sometimes harder to feel because it's not right at the surface of the skin and because of its location. The surgeon even said that another reason he wanted to remove it was because it was deeper and therefore more difficult to monitor. I'm just so frustrated by this whole situation. I just want them to remove it!!! Here's another thing that I wondered about. Are they supposed to take notes about the location or anything about it? The surgeon couldn't remember where my lump was, so how is he going to know if it changes in 3 months? I don't know how the monitoring process works if I end up having to go that route. ",

The tech and the radiologist could feel it and told me to come back in 3 months for a recheck and to see if anything would show up on an ultrasound. My gynecologist sent me to a general surgeon after I told her about the lump and she felt it. The surgeon at first was very nice and didn't treat me like I was being ridiculous for being there because of my age. I've heard \"you're too young\" so much throughout this process and it's been difficult to be taken seriously. The lump is located near my armpit and the surgeon felt it right away. He said he wanted to do a surgical biopsy to remove the whole lump because that's the only way to know exactly what it is and that they don't like to leave a lump because it could cause an issue later down the road? Has anyone been told this about leaving it causing issues later on? The surgeon did an ultrasound in his office and he was able to locate the lump but he put a little more pressure on the wand when he did the ultrasound than when the radiologist techs did it. The lump is a little deeper below the surface of the skin and that's why he applied a little more pressure. I was sitting in his office with minimal information about lumps in general and when he brought up doing a surgical biopsy-it scared me. I asked if he could order a mammogram to see if anything showed up on that and go from there. He ordered it but the radiologist refused to do it and instead did another ultrasound. The radiologist didn't feel to see if she felt the lump. She told me when the ultrasound came up normal that I was fine and that there is no lump. She basically told me to come back when I'm \"older\" because at my age, she couldn't understand what I would even be worried about. She asked in a sarcastic tone \"what are you worried-that it's cancer?\" I told her that I had never had any lumps and that I didn't know what it was. I then had a follow up appointment with the surgeon who had a completely different attitude this time. He told me that the radiologist said that I'm fine and although he felt the lump, it wasn't a concern to him. He said we could monitor it if that made me feel better and to come back in 3 months. I don't understand how his attitude could change like that-he's the one who brought up doing a surgical biopsy because he said that was the only way to know what it was and now he was acting like it was no big deal. I had finally felt ok about going through with the biopsy because I couldn't handle the stress of not knowing what the lump was (and he said that was the only type of biopsy we could do). I'm supposed to go back in October to see him again. I'm not sure what to do. I'm worried because I have had to fight so hard throughout this process to even get to see a surgeon because no one took me seriously because of my age. I don't know if I should go see a different surgeon or just push the one I've seen to do the biopsy. I have heard so many stories of young women being turned away by doctors and a year or so later-they find out they've had cancer (I know that's not alway the case of course, but I've read so many women's stories about their experience and it sounds too familiar). I know that most lumps are B9 but I have to know what mine is. Not knowing what this lump is-is torture. I don't want to keep living in fear.  29 years old Log in to post a reply",

I have been into different doctors since February but it's been a battle because too many of them believe in the \"you're too young\" ridiculousness (I'm 29). I had 2 ultrasounds and nothing showed up. I met with a surgeon this summer who could feel the lump and he ordered an mammogram but the radiologist refused to do it and instead did an ultrasound (even though the mammogram was approved by insurance-she wouldn't do it because I was under 30 and she didn't care what the surgeon said). The surgeon did another ultrasound in his office and he was able to find the lump but I was told by the radiologist that surgeons don't know how to do or read ultrasounds. When I first met with the surgeon, his initial plan was to do a surgical biopsy. He said he didn't think it was cancer but when they find a lump-they like to remove it so it doesn't become a problem down the road and that's the only way to know for sure what it is. At first I was completely freaked out when I heard surgery but I talked to different ladies on this site and did research and I decided to go ahead and meet with the surgeon again to ask questions about doing the surgical biopsy and to get it set up. After I met with him the first time, I went in for what was supposed to be a mammogram but turned into an ultrasound, and then when I went back to the second appointment with the surgeon-his attitude had completely changed because of the radiologist. He went from telling me he wanted to do a surgical biopsy to telling me we could monitor it (if I wanted to) but the radiologist said since she didn't see anything on the ultrasound-that nothing is there....well there's a lump, how could she say nothing was there? I have had to fight so hard and I've gotten nowhere. I just keep hearing that I'm too young and since I have no family history, what am I worried about? The surgeon told me to come back in October for a re check and I've been trying to keep it out of my mind but it's been about 8 months of torture, and I don't know if I should see another surgeon and push for the biopsy. I was told they couldn't do a needle biopsy and surgical was the only option. I'm scared and I've been scared since I found it...I just don't know if I should push for it or keep monitoring it. I have gotten so many differing answers-some say to have it removed while others think that would be extreme....this is the only time I feel \"too young\" because I don't know what to do which makes me feel helpless.

One doctor asked me \"what are you worried-that's it cancer?\" I said that I didn't know what it was but I've never had a lump before and I wanted answers. I was told I was being paranoid.  I know that the decision is up to me but I don't know anyone who has had a surgical biopsy to ask about this-is it extreme to have it done? Or is it not that big of a procedure? I'm trying not to think about the lump but it's so hard to not stress about it. I'm worried that it could be cancer and I'm just sitting here basically ignoring it. I know that it's most likely B9 but I would never be able to forgive myself if it is cancer and I just ignored my gut and waited around. ",

My doctor also had me come back after I was in the first time after my period to see if it had changed but it was still the same...I was hoping that was the cause. I hoped the lump was caused from something as easy as one of those but nothing has changed in these 9 months. It's all so frustrating :(",

I checked it the other day and figured it would still feel like the size of a pea but it doesn't. It feels like the width is pretty much the same but that it got longer. Do lumps change like that? ",
