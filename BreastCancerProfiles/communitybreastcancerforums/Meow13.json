I am 5 feet 3 inches and at the time weight 123 pounds and had a very fit body. Excuse me I would like to wear a bathing suit and not feel deformed. I left that office never to return. I heard others had terrible experiences. She would positively not work with radiated skin. Well I wasnt having radiation. I went to our university hospital and found a very nice plastic surgeon that did the DIEP. Wow it turned out great, flat tummy bonus.",

If your lobular cancer is slow growing I might question the effectiveness of chemo. The oncodx score is a statistical tool that can help guide you on a decision to treat with hormone blockers alone or adding chemotherapy. Unfortunately, you can never be assured your treatment will prevent recurrence. I had both lobular and ductal breast cancer, my oncologist did not consider my lobular any differently than my ductal. My oncologist was more concerned with my 95% er and 0% pr status. Also, my oncologist thought nothing of my having 2 tumors instead of one.",

I went to a different facility because after doing a mastectomy I didn't want implants I wanted my own tissue. I did the DIEP. I am sure they can do fat transfers and fill in divits. You need to find the right plastic surgeon. Go elsewhere even if you have to travel. My neighbor had a lumpectomy and she said medicare wouldn't pay for any cosmetic fix up for her. I don't believe it. Maybe someone else on BCO has experience with fix up after lumpectomy. It should be covered under insurance for breast cancer patients.",

But I wish I knew how good plastic surgery could be. I suffered so much not knowing I could look good again. There are many here that can look past losing all your hair, suffering permanent side effects from chemo, loss of nails, teeth and losing your breasts. But, most can be dealt with. Side effects can be mitigated, cold caps to save hair, plastic surgery to restore breasts. Most severe side effects are rare. There are people rallying others to go bald, go flat. It is psychological, some fight back like a badge of honor. It gives them strength I wish I had, everyone should do what they need. But for me, I don't want any physical reminders. I am happy with what I have received it was enough to make me feel good again. Seven years ago I was in the worse place ever. If only I could have looked ahead and seen it would be ok. It is going to be ok, you are freightened but your prognosis is good. There is no reason to believe it will come back. You do what you can. Good luck.",

Only 4 years though quit due to severe dry eye. What bothered me was my mitotic rate was 1 on both tumors.

I may have tried chemo if I had known about icing fingers and toes and cold caps. But I struggled for years in my 20s with IBS-D and it went away after having my first child.

The machine was new not the same one I had before. They went right to biopsy because of my history even though it was on my constructed DIEP side, no breast tissue side. Well there is a slim chance of left over tissue. Anyway it turned out to be nothing but fat necrosis. My onco was a bit puzzled since it had been 5 years since my surgery. So fast forward to my mammogram this month. I saw the area on the images and the radiologist was showing me the change from last years mammo. The tissue was tightening and compressing a mass from surgery. It was an encapsulation of scar tissue. She said it reacting by encapsulating around the scar tissue as if it were a foreign object. Bottom line it is not only possible but probable that surgery will cause some changes. The MRI is very sensitive and know to false positives. If I had a mammo right after the MRI I might have avoided the biopsy. Also the MRI radiologist told me that the biopsy was the thing to do since she thought it wouldn't show up on mammogram.",

      "Content": "Jun 24, 2014 02:15PM - edited Jun 24, 2014 02:42PM by Meow13 I read somewhere there is a math model (formula) that takes ki-67 into the equation. I would love to know why my number is 34. I don't know my ki-67. I am going to see if I can find that. I am not sold on the idea chemo can reduce my risk by half even with a fairly large sample size there are so many factors. The body is extremely complicated and personally I feel chemo may help extinquish the current fire but I wonder about the harm it is doing and the results of that. Since cancerous cells are constantly being dealt with by our immune systems it seems we should have some faith that it can work for us. After reading more about the 21 gene process, the number is derived from an iterative process (equations from experimental data) catergorizing various components here is a little blirt:   Katja Gwin, Marguerite Pinto, Fattaneh A Tavassoli   Department of Pathology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.  Source: PubMed    ABSTRACT Oncotype DX is a 21-gene assay that quantifies the recurrence risk in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, which is expressed as the recurrence score (RS). Studies have shown that patients with a high-risk RS will most likely benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, but there is no proven advantage for patients with a low-risk RS who still face an average recurrence risk of 7%. In this study, the relationship between the RS and the cell cycle-related antigen Ki-67 was assessed in 32 breast carcinomas and evaluated for a potential association. Comparison of the RS with tumor type, grade, and the Ki-67 proliferation index (PI) revealed an overall concordance. However, some tumors with a low RS revealed a surprisingly high Ki-67 PI. These cases may correspond to the 7% of low-risk RS carcinomas that recur. Therefore, the authors propose a combined evaluation of the RS and Ki-67 PI to identify tumors with high recurrence potential from the low-risk and intermediate-risk RS groups.   ",

I looked at all my pathology reports they say ER+ 95%, PR- and histologic blah blah grade 2, tubular formation was a 3 (poorly differentiated), mitosis was a 1 the other category was a 2 total Nottingham score 6. It was the mitosis that I felt the chemo would not be as effective as just taking care of myself boosting my immune system and starving the cancer cells out with anastrozole and exemestane. One interesting note is the Onco report says my score after using tamoxifen not AI drugs.  I think they are finding good results with the AI drugs. I had 2 totally separate tumors one nottingham 5 (ductal) one nottingham 6 (lobular), they were multicentric 2 o'clock and 3:30. Because I was postmenopausal at time of diagnosis I went right to anastrozole then after SE got bad after 1.5 years switched to exemestane. Almost 3 years out.",

But AI drugs are proving to be very effective for hormone positive cancers. I personally feel less potential harm on them than chemo. Also getting 5 years of treatment seems like a good idea. I had ILC and IDC did left mastectomy and DIEP. My right side is fine I believe in the hormone therapy. But it too can have permanent health related effects. You could maybe ask for a mammoprint or the symphony-test.",

I chose to not do the chemo and try the AI drugs. From what I have found AI drugs are much more effective for er+ pr- people than tamoxifen. Being both er and pr+ I have read tamoxifen and AI are about equally as effective. I am very happy I did not throw the toxic cocktail in my treatment and preserve my overall health. Some people don't have long term side effects but many do. The AI drugs have taken a toll on me but I am off them now. I believe the stats you quote are high on recurrence.

I think I said being able to wear a bathing suit and look good. She said back to me my expectations were too high. Look good in a bathing suit. She was awful, I decided I wanted a DIEP if I qualified. Well I had to go to our university hospital for that. I talked to the main surgeon that does it. He was very blunt, but when he saw me he said oh yeah I can do it. And if I didn't choose him and the DIEP he guaranteed I would be unhappy. Yikes, I went with him he did a fantastic job. But boy his ego was the biggest I have ever seen and no filter on his mouth.",

I couldn't bare to look at the mastectomy and when I had the reconstruction I found that I would forget I had cancer. Anything to look and feel like before I will do it. I used to feel my heart pounding I was so afraid of a slow painful death in a hospital bed. The first month after diagnosis almost killed me. Finally, one day I woke up and went without thinking of cancer for several hours. It went on the back burner. But every test especially cautionary biopsies sends me right back to that hell. I tell myself to keep looking for it, because I want to find it asap. I can't imagine what people with secord, third .. recurrences go through. The uncertainty the helplessness, I keep telling myself have faith and move on.",

I have much experience with curve fitting, my special focus and thesis was non linear optimisation. It is a bit disconcerting that our treatment is based on statistical results. Cancer is fairly individualized. I try to read as much as I can. I had 2 tumors one idc and one ilc, tumors were very similar but one had expression that determined 90% it was ilc. It was remarkable that I was 95 % as far as er receptors but 0% pr, her2 negative. I believe that contributed to my oncodx score of 34. Both my tumors were low grade with mitotic score of 1, I didn't get a ki-67 my oncologist said we don't report it in our labs. I like to gather as much info as I can. I chose no chemo and managed to get in almost 4 years of AI drugs. I am still NED, happy I did the conservative route of mastectomy. The DIEP reconstruction was pretty good. Most impact was all the surgery but I had no complications. No radiation or chemo. I hope I've seen the last of this cancer.",

It is a longer treatment I think 6 months vs 3 months on ACT. If you decide to do chemo that might have less side effects. But your tumor was small at 7mm but grade 3, I completely understand not wanting to do chemo to maybe make the odds of recurrence smaller. It is frustrating because there is no correct decision. Your ER shows receptors even though it isn't strongly positive hormone therapy can still be effective you also have a small percentage of pr receptors which is better than none.",

Well the first year was bad only emotionally I went through the surgery and the AI drugs with very little physical effects. I mean I had joint pain but it was more of an annoyance it didn't keep me from carrying on as usual. I fretted about when my life would be normal again, the not knowing is the worse.

I felt very sure chemo was not going to help me with bc recurrence and I still feel it was the right decision for me. The idea is to blast the cancer cells and because you are healthy you have a good chance of not having health issues as a result. Get an oncodx test or mamoprint and see what it says. I took aromatese inhibitors thinking I would not have permanent side effects and I found out that wasn't true. Luckily it isn't interfering with my life that much. I do miss how I used to feel before bc. I am sure you will soon hear from others that have been through chemo.",

So the labs at my hospital don't characterise luminal A or B. I was 95% er positive, having both idc and ilc 1 cm lesions makes my case more complicated. My oncodx was 34 but I didn't do the recommended chemo. So far 6 years no recurrence. I would like to know what a mammaprint would have said. I called the symphony test people one of their suite of tests is the mammaprint. At the time my tumor was 3 years old they said it had been too long to make any difference. As far as chemo treatment, it is only valuable for a short duration after diagnosis. I did 4 years on AI drugs, I am still recovering from side effects. The arthritis and ringing ear is still present but getting better I think after 2 years off meds. I will be so happy if I never get a recurrence, the minor stiffness and ear problem is a low impact on my QOL.",

Too much is put on the score in your case you had more positive nodes and therefore more belief cancer could have escaped. The score doesn't mean you won't recur. A coworker of mine was diagnosed with ILC one month after me. I had 2 tumors IDC and ILC close to skin, hers just 1 ILC spot near chest wall. She got her oncodx score a 4, mine was 34. I was so envious. Not 6 months later she told me they found cancer in her hip and spine. I asked her how they duscovered it, she said she had pain and her radiologist did a biopsy. I wasn't envious anymore. It is so important to look at all the information presented not just oncodx when making treatment decisions also trust your instincts nobody knows you better than yourself.",

My coworker who was diagnosed 6 months after me, she also had ILC stage 1 and months later had pain and her radiologist found lesions in her hip. I asked her about her treatment and she had targeted radiation and she was feeling pretty good. Also I have seen an MRI guided method to get relief from bone mets http://sperlingmedicalgroup.com/a-new-treatment-fo... MRI ultrasound treatment http://sperlingmedicalgroup.com/mr-guided-focused-...

I still have my husband but I feel so sad about the loss of my father. I don't think I have enjoyed my retirement I feel like I've lost touch with all my work friends. It is really hard to move on. I was thinking of you when I saw the mri guided ultrasound treatment Sperling medical. They are in Florida I was impressed with the fast pain relief they offer with little risk and side effects. However, the tumors have to be in certain spots.",
