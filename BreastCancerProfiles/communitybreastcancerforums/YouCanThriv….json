I am a trained patient advocate, and I also founded a non-profit for breast cancer survivors \"quality of life\" programs. This is very tricky territory. The her+ denotes that you probably had a more agressive DCIS that was more likely to turn invasive. However, modern science does not know what percentage of these cases actually turn invasive and what percentage if left untreated and using 'watchful waiting' would. I personally believe DCIS to be way over treated. However, you must make the decisions that are right for you. If there is no node involvement (micrometastis do NOT count as node involvement), there is a good chance that you will not need further treatment (but your onc may disagree and I am not a doctor). I would certainly in your position have that pre-cancerous cell structure tested with the ONCOTYPE test once it is removed to see if it has I high 'recurrence score' this will give you the best information as to weather further treatment and especially chemotherapy are going to be beneficial for you. The preliminary pathology indicates that it could be a virle form of DCIS but I know women who had virle DCIS and when it did turn invasive it became slow growing. There is lots to learn, and it is very important you become your own best advocate or begin to work with an educated advocate. If you'd like to contact me at my website, our organization offers advocacy and other services free of charge. In health, Luana  youcanthrive.orgÂ ",
