About three fingers down for my collarbone. I\u2019m assuming this is a swollen lymph node? Log in to post a reply",

The tech felt the pebble like lump. It was not visible on the mammogram. The ultrasound technician barely grazed the area and did not examine the rest of the breast. The doctor came in and said \"Well, it's not visible on the mammogram or the ultrasound. It could be breast tissue. Of course if it gets bigger, call your doctor.\" When I asked the Dr about the sore and swollen lymph nodes around the armpit area, he said, \"Well, have you been messing with it?\" No, I don't think I have cancer. But I have not been 'messing' with my breast enough to make it sore - it was very tender the day I did my SBE. Also, \"The fact that you're having any pain at all makes me less concerned.\"",

      "Content": "Nicnojo wrote: I really don't think it's IBC. I was in the shower on Wednesday, April 4. Doing my exam. I have never ever, ever felt anything before. What I felt was not exactly a lump but a hardness directly above my left nipple. I thought maybe I was just in a weird position in the shower and maybe this is a duct or gland that is the same on the right breast so when I got out of the shower and laid on the bed and did the exam again. But no this is definitely something hard. And then I noticed that I am really sore up near my collarbone and underneath my arm around my armpit. And this area is swollen and has gotten more swollen over the last couple of days. I also noticed what looks like a bruise on the outside of my left breast. The breast feels heavy and achy. I have had some shooting pains and burning sensation. It seems to be getting worse even though it's only been a few days. Normally I would chalk this up to paranoia. But after I had had a few hours of not feeling anything I talked myself into the fact that maybe I just have some arthritis in that shoulder area and that it's nothing at all. Until I started having the shooting pains again. And as I said here typing this I even feel like the area burning is moving up and towards my collarbone between the breasts and I have not felt that before. I'm going to sound like a hypochondriac but I'm having arm pain as well and can't even lay on that side, I woke my husband up the other night moaning because it hurt so bad. This has all come up all of the sudden. On an odd note, about three weeks ago, I woke up and had a really odd feeling in that breast. I can't say that it was pain but it just felt really strange and the first thought that came to my mind was geez I hope I don't have breast cancer. Forgot all about this even the day that I found the lump until my sister reminded me because I had told her about it. I was supposed to have my mammogram on May 4. I always have it near my birthday which is May 2. I'm now having it next Wednesday, April 11 at 8 AM. I had a hysterectomy at age 30. Any advice is welcomed and appreciated. Thank you.
