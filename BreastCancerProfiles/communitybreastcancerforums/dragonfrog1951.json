I spoke to the surgeon today and she told me the tumor is larger than reported by the ultrasound but still feels that Lumpectomy is the best course. I have been very calm throughout the mammograms, ultra-sound. core needle biopsy, and diagnoses. My life the past few years has been one disaster after another and I guess I am numb. I don't know how I am supposed to feel. Some people make it all sound so routine and easy to deal with but a part of me says \" hey, this is my body your talking about, my breast! I ask about side effects and the surgeon says \" everyone is different.\" I wish someone could honestly tell me what the whole experience is like. I feel like I am walking into this blind. Well, that felt good to say all that! Thanks for listening. Mary D. Bouley Dx 11/16/2011, IDC, 2cm, Stage IIIB, Grade 3, 0/2 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
