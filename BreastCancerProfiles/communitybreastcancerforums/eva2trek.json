Both nodes were clear, and they released me the next day. My nurses were great, and I only have 1 drain so I'm feeling very lucky. Everything is pretty numb, but I do get twinges and sudden pains now and then. I am taking Oxycodon-acetaminophen for the pain, with cyclobenzaprine for muscle spasms and cephalexin (antibiotic). I took stool softener before and after my surgery, but I didn't have a bowel movement until Thursday, after I did some walking. I really recommend taking a brisk walk if possible to get things moving. My PS is concerned about a small area of skin that may not be viable, but he thinks that I have enough good skin on both sides to make a resection go well. I'm currently doing hyperbaric treatments (high pressure O2) to improve healing, and it seems to be helping. To everyone awaiting surgery, best wishes and try to think positive, it may not be as horrible as you fear. Great big hugs and lots of luck to all who have had their surgeries, I wish everyone all the best in dealing with this!",

Things seem to be moving very fast, I meet the PS for the first time on Wednesday! I find my thoughts constantly dwelling on the cancer, and I'm concerned about the recovery time from the surgery. Your posts are very informative and helpful, especially just knowing you're all so generous with your experiences and insights. I want to thank you all and wish everyone the very best now and in the future. May we all have the strength to cope and the friends to help us do it!",

My surgery was Nov 18 and I'm healing very well, very little pain and I'm getting around quite easily, although I'm not supposed to lift my left arm above my shoulder, it has no tightness and little pain. My PS has me doing Hyperbaric O2 treatments daily, that's high pressure high oxygen in a pressure chamber. Luckily the medical center that has these chambers is right here in town, and it's made a remarkable improvement in my condition, and the skin that looked dead on my skin flap has recovered and is almost normal. Swelling and redness is down, my drain is less than 40 cc/day and I have almost normal energy. For all of you who are experiencing a difficult recovery, please ask your doctor if they have considered hyperbaric therapy, it increases your oxygen levels and that's a big help to promote healing in damaged tissues. I can't wait to show my PS and BS the results today and tomorrow, respectively. For everyone with constipation problems, try eating yogurt with active cultures, and try to get up and walk for at least 1 mile at a normal pace, that was what got my system back to moving things along. All my best to everyone, you are all wonderful and I can't thank you enough for your caring and support.",
