I just found out today that I'll be getting a biopsy done on March 7th. I'm 41 years old with 2 kids & a husband. I'm scared to death. I just watched my mother die of lung cancer 2 months ago. It was pure agony for me. I just don't want to go thru any of this. I never have even felt a lump. I just went in for my first mammogram, then they called me for a 2nd & a 3rd. Also an ultrasound. They said it was incuclusive??? I work at a school, i've been there for 11 years. I make copies everyday all day long. The 3 women that worked there before me all had breast cancer. one died, she was only 42. I'm about to lose my mind. No one seems to understand how I feel. (family & friends)",
