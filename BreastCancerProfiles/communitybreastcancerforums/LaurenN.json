Surgery (removal of lump) showed benign lump there and also other breast at that time.....it was hard in that area always ...even after all that time scar tissue in that spot. Scar tissue is tough stuff. PS. My diagnostic mammo /ultra was originally Aug 6....due to opening I got in today....so relieved....but of course they don't tell you anything....this was for a couple of areas totally different than what I mentioned above..now have to wait until Aug 13 for doctor appointment as they send her any results....and she is on vacation next week so can't hear anything any sooner.",
