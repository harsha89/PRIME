I was assured by the radiology department that it was \u201cjust scar tissue\u201d due to my previous breast reduction years ago. I use to be an oncology nurse and knew spiculated rarely was good, i declined there first recommendation to wait 6 months and repeat mammo And US. Breast biopsy was done on 12/20 was called on 12/26 confirming what I already knew. I was scheduled and had surgery 1/8, unfortunately one of the margins were not clean. I had another surgery on 1/22 which cleared all margins. Oncotype came back at a 12, genetics negative. left breast stage 2A ILC. One node showed isolated cancer cells but was considered negative. I am schedule for a radiation consult 1/8. Although I have a strong Oncology background i still find myself researching everything, wondering if i should have had a mastectomy, is not doing chemo ok. I do trust my oncologist but can\u2019t stop my anxiety at times.

The last 7 will be boosts. I am doing the breath hold since I am being radiated on my left side. I was told to use pure aloe for the first 2 weeks then pure aloe mixed with aquaphor for the last 4 weeks. My breast is already red and fatigue has been horrible since the 2nd treatment although I am not sure if that is mostly due to the 100 mile round trip.",
