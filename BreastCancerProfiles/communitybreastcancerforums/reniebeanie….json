They saw 3 2cm masses, and performed a biopsy that came back with secretory-like findings. Originally, her doctor said it was stage 1, grade 2 and triple neg. He said she had a very good outlook and wouldn't need chemo or radiation, only a lumpectomy. Then he came back and said she would need chemo, and came back again 2 weeks later saying she wouldn't. She just had a double mastectomy 2 days ago. After the surgery, her surgeon came out and said they got all of the cancer and that her outlook with secretory was good. The pathology report just came back today saying that she had 2 tumors in the left breast. One was 0.6 cm and the other was 6 cm. The report says the pathologist found DCIS, cribriform and micro papillary, and secretory types. It also says she is stage 3, and her doctor says she will need radiation or chemo. What I don't understand is how 5 months ago there was nothing on a mammogram, she only had 2 cm masses, was stage 1, and wasn't going to need chemo. Now she has a 6 cm mass, is stage 3 and probably needs chemo. How could they have missed a 6 cm mass? How did it take her doctors 5 months to figure out what was wrong with her? I feel like they have no idea what they are doing, and I need to find her a doctor that has treated invasive secretory carcinoma before. I'll take her anywhere. I don't care if we have to travel to the other side of the country. Any suggestions?",
