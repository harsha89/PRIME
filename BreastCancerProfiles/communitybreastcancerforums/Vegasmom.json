Suepen, just wanted to say TCH my hair started to really fall out on day 17 after my first chemo treatment. The majority of it was gone within 3 days.  Every treatment it just continued to fall out more.  Don't hold onto it, cuz  I did, what little hair that was left will fall out after chemo, when the new starts growing in.    ",
