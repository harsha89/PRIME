      "Content": "saleboat wrote: I saw the lymphedema PT today-- she called my case 'mild' and used the phrase 'pitting edema' which I understand puts me at a Stage I lymphedema. I really don't want to freak out about this, but she seemed so somber when discussing the things I will do-- I'm to see her twice a week, she's going to teach me how to wrap my arm, and I need to get a glove to go with my compression sleeve. I am SOOOOOOOOO mad at myself. I've been trying to get in shape, and I was working out with a trainer, feeling great...now this. I feel like I coulda shoulda done something to prevent this. I hate this friggin' disease...ever feel like you just have a monkey on your back? Jen DX 4/15/05 3C ER+ PR+ HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "saleboat wrote: Ugh! I overdid it at the gym, and now my right arm is slightly swollen. I have an appt to see a lymphedema specialist next week, but I'm hoping it will reverse itself on its own...does that ever happen? I can't stand this!!! Is it possible to get a case of lymphedema, manage it through therapy and then never have to deal with it again (except by prevention and being careful)? The swelling is slight, I'm going to guess in the 5 cm range. This is so frustrating, but the therapist said she could fix it...I hope she's right!
