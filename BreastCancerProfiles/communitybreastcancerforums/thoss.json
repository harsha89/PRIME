I saw my family doctor immediately who booked me for a mammogram and an ultrasound. What it feels like: seems round (defined borders), very hard, flat, smooth, stuck to the tissue it's on, deep in the breast (in the aureola) at 1pm, no bigger than a lentil. No pain. No changes of any sort to the breast. There is no history of breast cancer in my family. I do not have any children, but have been pregnant once. No birth control pills ever taken. No hormonal therapy etc. My periods have always been regular. The mammogram and ultrasound were both clear and no calcifications or changes were detected in the surrounding tissues. My family doctor still wants to be sure and has scheduled me to see a surgeon this Tuesday. Needless to say, I am worried! I would so appreciate your thoughts or any shared experiences with this type of lump. Thank you! Log in to post a reply",

The thing that worries me the most is the fact that it doesn't move (and trust me I have been obssessively feeling it often enough to know that it is, in fact, \"stuck\" to/on the tissue). I have been googling the topic (although I know i shouldn't) and I came across a website in which a breast surgeon stated something to the effect of: \"we are able to see changes to the breast way before a mass is palpable\". This gives me an iota of peace. I will definitely keep you updated and please do the same. In the meantime, I wish you ALL the best of luck!",
