My hair has come in real nice.. but I have a new look its still short but I have alot of curls !! I am working with it ... Its different.. but I was wondering does the curl last will my hair change again ? If this has happened to you can you tell me your story. My color came back with alot of gray.. At this point I will leave my hair short the hot flashes are real bad sometime I look like I just got out of the shower. would like to hear from you. Nanner",
