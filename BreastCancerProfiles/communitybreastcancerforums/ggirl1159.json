It is in the same spot and is the same size on both sides. They have been there for a few years now I think. I've recently found out that my mother has had a few biopsys for lumps and has another one tommorow. She has much larger breats than myself (I'm only a B cup) and found her first at around age 30- I'm only in my early 20's. Does this sound like some normal anatomy and I'm blowing this out of proportion because of my mom? Thanks for any advice Log in to post a reply",
