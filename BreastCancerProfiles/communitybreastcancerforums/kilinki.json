Thank you so much for all your amazing stores, words of wisdom and motivation.  You have no idea how much you help people with your posts. I too joined the April group last week.  My first TC was on Wednesday, 16 April.  I am now 9 days post chemo and can honestly say my side effects were minimal.  How blessed am I?!?!  YAY!!! The anti-nausea and anti-histamine drugs that were administered to me before the chemo totally knocked me out.  I was in such a fog the whole time and slept through the actual chemo. I am trying the Elasto-Gel cold caps to preserve my hair.  The only time I woke up was every 30 to 40 minutes when my hubby and the chemo nurse had to change my caps.  Other than that I slept.  The caps are not as uncomfortable or bad as I was preparing myself for.  My session lasted just under 4 hours.  When I got home I was still very drowsy and slept for another 2 hours.  That night I was even able to cook supper for my husband and I and got to enjoy the meal too. On Thursday I felt a little light-headed and tired, but still managed to get the house ready for my mom's arrival on Friday. The only other side efffect that I'm experiencing is the furry, yuk, metalic mouth.  Gross! I decided to use the Annique vitamins (www.annique.co.za) while on chemo.  I have read numerous success stories of other chemo (and particularly breast cancer) patients who used them with great success.  Maybe that is the reason for my side effects being so easy to deal with. At the moment the only thing stressing me out is an appointment with a surgeon next week to discuss having a port installed.  I had Lymphoma at 16 and went through CHOP chemotherapy.  Thanks to that my veins are completely damaged.  They got the IV in after the 3rd attempt last week.  I don't mind the pricking but the chemo nurses seem to mind.  I was also told that there will be problems if the chemo leaks into my tissue so they need to keep a close eye on me.  And the port is considered the \"safer\" option.  I'm still not convinced that a port is really necessary.  I only have 5 chemos to go... Living one day at a time, enjoying the little moments, spending extra special time with my baby boy and husband and keeping a positive attitude is definitely seeing me through this journey... Good-luck to all of you starting chemo in the next few days and to those who have your next treatments coming up! Much love from South Africa, x",
