I have also feel some nauseous and some headache/dizziness. The doctor says these symptom are not supposed to link with BC radiation, but it started exactly after my radiation and I know for sure it is an associated effects in my case.  Hope we all can get through the radiation process successfully. ",

I was found bilateral breast cancer ( left DCIS/IDC and right DCIS) in May/June 2018, and had the bilateral lumpectomy on July 23. Fortunately the cut tissues had clean margins and on both side the sentinel lymph nodes were negative. On August 7th I saw my RO and he decided a plan of 3 weeks whole breast radiation and one week boost for tumor area (the accelerated plan). The radiation will be on both breasts. On August 8th I have the CT scan and the markings done. The radiation therapy will start on next Monday Aug 13th. I am looking forward to have this done and wanted to get my life back to normal again. Thanks for the folks who post in this forum. I got both information and courage from others. And I will share my experience as well.  Winnie",

I am 68 years old and still work full timely, and in general in good health (other than those bilateral breast Cancer ;-)). A routine mammogram screening initially found the cancer. I do not feel any thing unusual. No lump felt. I was diagnosed DCIS on my right breast in early May, 1.7CM. ER+/PR+. And before the scheduled June 1st lumpectomy, the MRI/biopsy revealed the left breast of IDC , 0.6CM, Stage 1, ER+/PR+/HER -. The Surgeon postponed the surgery and ordered me genetic /DRCA test which turned out all negative. I have a bilateral lumpectomy surgery scheduled on 07/23/2018. The decision to pick which way to go ( lumpectomy +radiation, or mastectomy +implant reconstruction) was a difficult process- and I eventually decide to go lumpectomy plus radiation. Hopefully I have made the right decision. Being diagnosed as a cancer patient was a shocking to me. And I have gone through the stages of scared, worried, feel uncertainty, ,... many emotions. But during the process of testing I came into encountered so many different doctors and medical professionals., I was always being treated warmly and professionally. I am gradually becoming calm and starting accept the reality and I have cancer and I have to actively work with doctors to fight it. I am glad that I have found this forum. Other cancer survivors' posts definitely help my fight with my cancer. Thank you all! ",
