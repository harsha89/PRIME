I'm 38, no cancer but BRCA1 positive. A lot of cancer in my family. I chose to have my ovaries, tubes and breasts removed at 37. That was my decision and feel great about it. You need to find your way to peaceful thinking. The worst thing is stress. A naturopath that I have seen and that was against my decison told me that stress is the best cancer trigger. So in my case, keeping my breasts was so stressful and source of anxiety that I was better off them. What a relief I felt when I woke up. And I did the right thing because in my right breast there were 4 lesions, one was precancerous. Good luck in your reflexion!",

My risks were 90% BC and 65% OC because I have BRCA1, because of the family history and because I smoked for 20 years and was sedentary. I was pretty much doomed. The decision was easy.  Like others, I suggest you talk to a genetic counselor...that will help you make the decision.",

No matter the kind of cancer, your genetic and family background are big components in your risks factors. I think you should be tested if you are worried. Good luck!",

Science has evolve and now we know about BRCA1 and 2 but there are hundreds of mutations that we carry around. Every illness has its genetic components, are we going to stop having babies?!?!?! NO. I would suggest that you have your child as soon as you can though....the longer you are exposed to hormones the higher your risks to get hormonal sensitive cancer.  I'm 37, no cancer but BRCA1 positive. I decided to have my breasts and ovaries removed. I should have done it at 28. 10 years before the yougest case of cancer in my family which was my aunt who died of lung cancer at 38.
