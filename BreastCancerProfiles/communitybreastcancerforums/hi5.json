What a bummer!!! I'd had bilat with reconstruction and didn't expect to have to have rads.  Because of deep incisions and probably the rads my bc boob does not look that great e even reconstructed...has a creasing affect.  Anyone else out there had the same. Also I was borderline for needing chemo...onc sent specimen back for 2nd report but because I was borderline he decided I didn't need chemo.  Go figure. ",
