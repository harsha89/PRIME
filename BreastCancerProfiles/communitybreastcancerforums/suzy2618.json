      "Content": "suzy2618 wrote: Please someone help me. I am so anxious, I can't eat or sleep. 3 weeks ago I woke up with a swollen breast and redness that covered almost half of my right breast. I had horrible pain and it felt extremely warm. I went to the ER right away and they did an u/s and blood work and just diagnosed me with mastitis. WBC was high. They sent me home on two antibiotics and an antibiotic cream. I am 31 years old, my daughters are 9 and 5 year old so I am Not breastfeeding. Symptoms didn't get better so 3 days later I go see my OB and he sent me for another ultrasound at a diagnostic center because the one at the ER was basic. I go for the u/s and everything normal, the radiologist laughed at me and said you don't have IBC I am 100%. I begged him for an MRI or a Biopsy and he said no. So The next day I go to the hospital and requested to get admitted. They admitted me and had me 24 hrs there with IV antibiotics. At this point WBC was normal but CRP high, the next day CRP was re checked and went to normal.Redness went away. I go back to my OB because it was still swollen, he sent me to a breast specialist. I went to the specialist and she squeezed my nipple and a bit of water blood came out (very small amount) she sent if for cytology and said maybe they won't be able to see anything because it was such a small amount. She sends me for a mammogram and MRI she said her suspicion of IBC was very low but the def something was going on with my breast. SO a week after i go to my appt and the appt was cancelled without letting me know because the Radiologist thought it wasn't a good idea to do an MRI when I still have inflammation which can lead to a false positive and uneccessary biopsy. I cried my eyes out to the dr, i begged her to please do the mri and she completely refused. She said the citology came back negative. SHe agreen on the mammogram so I had it done but results were normal. SHe said she would do an mri in 4-6 weeks! TO call the first day of my period! So now i have to wait and i am desperate. The redness is gone, breast isnt as swollen but I get this random sharp/stabbing pain. Also my areola puckers like if I Was cold when i raise my right arm and the nipple flattens a bit. WHen my arm is down it goes away and my nipple goes back to normal. I honestly think I have inflammatory breast cancer. I don't know what else to do for the doctor to do an mri. WHEn I asked her to do a biopsy she said a biopsy of what there is nothing to do a biopsy from. DId anyone have similar symptoms as me? please help me . I do have a small tiny bruise looking spot it has not gotten darker or bigger. Log in to post a reply",

Funny thing I am in the US and was dismissed by ER doctors, my own OB/Gyn that has been my doctor since I was 18 (31) now- he delivered both of my girls, I was dismissed by a breast specialist and a radiologist. I did have a punch biopsy done but had to beg and argue and called Patients Advocate to finally get it (they have a 25% false negative by the way. Finally I found a breast specialist and NP that showed concerned and sent me for an MRI and after that a guided biopsy. Some doctors think they know it all. They don't know it all, they aren't perfect, they are't God. Keep being your own advocate if you feel something isn't right. Better safe than sorry.",
