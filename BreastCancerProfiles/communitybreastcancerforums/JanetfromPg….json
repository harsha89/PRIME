I am in week 2 and have had radiation side effects from day 1 unfortunately.  My nipple and surrounding area are pink and warm to touch from the beginning with some swelling (like I had from the surgery).  Currently, I have tenderness at the surgery site and pink and warm all over with some pulling and shooting pains.",

I have seen a lot of comments about soy.  My oncologist says that it is okay to take some soy which will help with hot flashes???  I started taking an herb called Breast Health when I was diagnosed which has soy in it.  I'm not taking it or anything else during radiation but he said that I could take it with tamoxofin to help with side effects and will start taking IP-6 & Inositol along with tamoxofin.  Studies show that the two work synergistically. ",

I go for my pancreas testing on the lesion on Friday.  I surely want to know what this is so I can either figure out a new treatment plan or not have to worry and focus solely on radiation and then the dreaded tamoxofin. Hope everyone is doing well!!  Bubbaloo, been thinking of you. ",

As for the comment, I did a little investigating and it is not someone on this thread.  She also sent me another message today and told me I was a big baby!  LOL  I won't say who it is but apparently my comment about being embarrassed about not being allowed to shave under my arm during radiation got her in a tizzy since I should be \"grateful that I have hair to shave.\"  I meant no disrespect but I never connected that chemo makes you lose the hair under your arms.  Today, she said that I was telling people that it was okay to take soy and that soy is what got most women having cancer.   Going Tuesday for the pancreas surgeon so we'll see.  Supposed to start radiation on Thursday.  Thanks for your support girls!  I appreciate it as I'm ready for the bridge. ",
