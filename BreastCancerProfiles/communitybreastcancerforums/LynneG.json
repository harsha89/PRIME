I've heard that it really helps. I didn't learn about it until recently, and don't know if it would help me now or not.",

Recently my GP diagonosed me with condochondritis - which is the connecting tissue of the ribs to the sternum inflamed. It felt like my rib was coming unhinged just below my bra. Only treatment is to try not to move the area. No heavy lifting or excersizing with weights, etc. It is better with comparitive inactivity. I was doing a lot of yoga - downward dog and push up type movements.",
