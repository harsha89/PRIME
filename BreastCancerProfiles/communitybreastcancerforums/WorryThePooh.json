For some reason I believed I would never get breast cancer, no family history and a doctor once told me my breast tissue was least likely to get breast cancer. So my diagnosis of IDC last week has left me in complete shock. I am very fortunate to be having the lumpectomy already tomorrow, but feel absolutely terrified. Trying to focus on the fact that the good thing is the cancer will be removed, but then I don't know if there's any spread. Apparently they do a dye test first, no idea what involves or if it is painful. I suppose I shouldn't be focusing on all these small details, but anyway...oh dear rambling on here.
