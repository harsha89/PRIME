All of a sudden, whenever I inhaled I had pain. It was like the kind of pain you get when you are swimming or in the water for a long time. It lasted about a day & a half. Then, about 6 weeks later, about 2 weeks after I finished treatment, the same thing happened again. I went to my primary doctor, who recommended that I go to the emergency room. I went & they gave me a cat scan & blood test & cardio test & nothing came up (fortunately). I haven't had the problem recur since. I finished my radiation on 2/28/14. My radiologist couldn't provide any insight. You might want to ask your Drs. Now at least you know you are not alone in having side effects. Hope this eases your fears a little.",
