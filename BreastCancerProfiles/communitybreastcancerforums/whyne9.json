Im too afraid to go to the doctor as I have been through some recent trauma and feel that I cannot trust anyone right now. Im so confused and dont know what to do. I need to talk to someone and tell them exactly why I am unable to go to see anyone about this. I havent been able to sleep as a result of this. Is there anyone out there who is able to talk to me or put me in touch with someone that I can talk to about my \"situation\"? Im really desperate. I would appreciate it. Log in to post a reply",
