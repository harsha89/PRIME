I have dense breast had had discharge in the past that turned out to be nothing they said. I noticed that I had it again and that the color went from a yellow to green and now dark red and brown. My primary care physician found a lump near nipple along with swelling& some redness. Going for a mammogram and ultrasound today at the same place that did the previous testing almost three years ago. I lost my 22 year old son almost two years ago suffered from major depression and never had a repeat mammogram!! I'm SCARED as well as full of anxiety that it's been so long since I had a mammogram, especially since they'd put the marker in after seeing a suspicious areas. I should mention I also had a biopsy done which was negative that was done following the insertion of the marker and testing almost three years ago. If anyone has any advice please write back as I am so worred. Thank you all in advance Log in to post a reply",
