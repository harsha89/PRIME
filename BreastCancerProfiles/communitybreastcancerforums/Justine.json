However, it seems my GP was not happy with the appearance of the lump this time and she ordered a mammogram instead, and a referral to the breast specialists at the local hospital. I went along for the mammo last Tuesday, still convinced it was just a cyst and began to feel a little concerned when I was asked to go from there to have an ultrasound. When I entered the ultrasound room, the radiologist was silently studying the mammo images and his look of concern slightly increased my anxiety. He performed the ultrasound then told me that there were several areas of concern and that he would like to perform a biopsy right there and then. By this time I was feeling quite distressed and looking for reassurance but he did not seem interested in giving me any - he was too busy preparing his instruments and instructing the nurse. I was given local anaesthetic - but not enough, I think - and he made an incision with a scalpel and withdrew 6 pieces of tissue using a mamotome. I had this procedure done 2 years ago and it was nothing like as painful as this time! I think he went in much deeper than last time - it felt like he was hitting my chest wall. I was then taken to see a consultant and given a cup of tea while she told me that the lump (3cm) was 'probably not a cyst', that there was another suspicious solid mass and that there was 'something behind it that is cause for concern'. I tried to seek reassurance by making hopeful comments about 80% of lumps being benign but she was not having it - she just kept saying, 'I am not saying it is impossible for it to be benign - I am saying that we have grounds for concern.' I am going back in two days (an 8-day wait in total) and meantime I am keeping myself busy and trying to remain optimistic. My family and friends oscillate between being dismissive and reacting quite badly to the situation so I feel there is no one who can really understand how I am feeling at the moment. I know you can't really give me any answers here but I appreciate being able to write about it!",

I realise too that what I feel at the moment (amongst other very mixed feelings) is a sense of gratitude that all the tests were done on one day rather than having the whole thing drag out over a month, as happened the last time. I am grateful, too, that the doctors didn't just jump to the simple quick-fix of draining my cyst without doing any further exploration. (Actually, during the biopsy, the radiologist did try to drain the cyst but nothing was aspirated - apparently not too good a sign.) If this does turn out to be something more than cysts then I am beginning to feel now that I will cope. I suffer from chronic anxiety and panic attacks but I have every faith that my GP will not let me go through all this without some sort of medication. I will just treat it as one more of life's hurdles and look forward to being able to tick it off as 'done' on my 'to do' list. If, on the other hand, I get a good result on Wednesday, I am going to see this whole experience as an epiphany and resolve to change all those bits in my life that need changing! I have already started clearing out old clutter and getting my accounts in order - this waiting is really rather good for the housework if not for the psyche!",
