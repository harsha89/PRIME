This has been  quite a wake up call for me regarding Susan Love.  When I was initially dx'ed,  there was another very MAJOR trauma going on in my life, which  severely limited my ability to do lots of research for the first month before treatment.  I spoke with several women who had been treated for BC about 15 years ago, all of whom enthusiastically recommended her book to me.  Several women, including medical professionals, warned me to 'stay away from those internet boards.' Consequently, I based a lot of my  initial decisions on her book.(though I did consult medical sites like NCI, medical journals  and something in UK) I only ventured onto this board in June, and have found it to be an incredibly rich resource, not only for information, but for support and validation of my experience during this journey.  Treasure trove is a very apt description, thank you Athena for putting it so eloquently. That's not to say we should believe everything posted here without question or a healthy dose of skepticism. We have to verify and reverify every bit of information  we  use to guide us in our decision making, whether it comes from Susan Love, our own doctors  or a website.  I also appreciate the women who jump in to point out errors when someone has posted some misinformation. I believe for the most part this is not done maliciously. I  feel the more I read here, the more my eyes are opened.  Thanks to all who contribute.",

I noticed that your diagnosis stated Stage one, but your tumor size is over 2 cm.  That would be stage 2.  In that case, radiation is certainly warranted.  There are web sites posted earlier that deal with recurrence rates based on size of margins. You need to discuss your concerns with your rad onc and medical oncologist for the best explanation of risks and benefits. I had 25 rounds of radiation on the right side, and had no significant problems with it, other than a bit of skin burning and tiredness around the three week point.  Many women sail through rads.  Are you in a support group?  There you would meet other women going through rads who could give you some idea what to expect, though everyone is different in how they react. I found rads comforting in that they reduced my risk or recurrence by 50% and gave me more piece of mind.  Good luck !",

Then he just walked out the door! I was too stunned to protest and felt blindsided.  After asking a few questions of the receptionist, I learned there is a new 'Survivorship Program' women are being transitioned into who are no longer in active treatment at the teaching hospital where I receive treatment. I also learned a friend of mine, who is  2 years into being Stage 4 is also seeing the nurse practioner instead of her onco at the same place. From my reading of these boards, it seems most women here see their onco's for a full five years after diagnosis.I was initially told that is what I would be doing too. I was always careful to have my questions ready and organized so our visits could be efficient. My oncologist was terrific with me during treatment and really went to bat for me, getting me Zometa when it wasn't as commonly used as it is today anong other things.  I really hesitate to leave  his care or the teaching hospital, since they are very well-respected, but I also feel cancer is a very serious disease that needs a real MD monitoring it. I am fine with an NP for many things, but this just makes me uneasy.  I think this is a general policy decision at this hospital, to free the onco's for women in active treatment, also a cost cutting measure.

This research (on BC.org) says there is a 20ish% chance of recurrence for highly dense breasts.\" Did your oncologist base your recurrence risk on your Oncotype score? If so, I  the oncotype recurrence rate refers to your risk of distant metastisis (outside the breast, to other organs). The research in the article is talking ablout local recurrence. (in the breast) The article states, \"Mammographic density did not appear correlated with metastasis to distant sites.\" So you may have a higher risk of local recurrence, but the 94% risk of distant recurrence would be the same.  Best to confirm with your oncologist.

I found that having someone take copious notes really helped.  I wrote out all my questions beforehand and gave them to the doctor before the meeting so they could be looked over.  I even had someone record the sessions and I found it very helpful to listen to them again at home.  You don't always 'hear' everything when you are under stress. A second opinion to confirm diagnosis and treatment plan  is always a good idea. I am wishing you all the best.",

My stats: Stage one, lupectomy, re-excision, rads, Arimidex, and  Zometa twice a year. I live in the Bay Area and have also spent a lot of time in Boston. Agree they are two great places. Somebody a while back mentioned having something done on Friday the 13th. Well,  my first surgery was Fri the 13th, my post op mamogram on the next Friday the 13th and my appt with my new PCP is on...Friday 13!  Hope it went well for you.",

I was informed by three oncologists, my surgeon and research I have done that the Oncotype test is very useful for postmenopausal women making a decision on chemotherapy. In  younger women who are premenopausal, some oncologists may disregard a low oncotype score because the feeling is the woman has more time to develop a recurrence.  None of this is written in stone, however, because grade and type of cancer, as well as  patient preference is often taken into account. There are several threads on BCO  on this topic. You can also google Oncotype Dx and either read their site or call the company directly. *New* ~OncoDX~ Roll Call~*New* NEW Oncotype Dx Roll Call Thread London-Virginia:  Have  any studies come out in the UK refuting the validity of the Oncotype test for postmenopausal women?  If so, I'd be interested in reading them.  Thanks.  Wezee:  You are a wonderful sister!  After your sister's final  pathology report comes in, they will know for sure whether her nodes were involved or not.  If your sister is borderline for chemo, they will probably order the ONCOTYPE test to help determine whether she will have chemo or not.   ",

It doesn't really indicate how long a period that was since it probably varied. The other group got the Zometa immediately.  When I started Zometa, I was told to start at the same time I began the arometese inhibitor.  Ask your oncologist.  I don't think one year out is too late. ",

However, I agonized over my decision and my onc said he would give me chemo if I  really wanted it. I finally chose no chemo, but I am stage 1 and over 60 years old.  I am sorry you are going through this.  Please let us know what the second opinion was.    ",
