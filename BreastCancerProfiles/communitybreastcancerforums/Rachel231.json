Basically found a lump in my armpit on Sunday night. I put it down to maybe a blocked gland but decided to get it checked out wasnt too worried but ill like to check these things out with the doctor. So went to the doctors he confirmed I was correct it was a blocked gland nothing to worry about but while I was there he decided to do a breast examination to double check to my horror he did actually find another lump that was suspisious and he wants me to get checked out.........I had a bit of a breakdown tears everything I got so scared. Im being sent for another breast exam, ultrasound and then diagnosis I guess. My question really is will a biopsy be done, will I be given the diagnosis or what it is on the day basically what is the whole process. Im really scared I cant get into my head \"its probably nothing\" because thats what I thought in the first place and I was completely wrong. :( Any advice would be a great help.Â  Log in to post a reply",
