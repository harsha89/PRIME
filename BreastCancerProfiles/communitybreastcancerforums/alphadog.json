I began searching because of my bleeding from my stereotactic core biopsy on Tuesday.....anxiously waiting for the results. I too had a lot of bleeding after the biopsy and the nurse had to compress for a long time. I was holding up other patients so they admitted me in a patient room for an LPN to further compress. Finally after ice and compression I was sent on my way w/out the last image taken to conclude the markers were placed in the right area. This morning I finally went back to the surgeon and they put two stitches in. At times it was a little blood and other times if I lifted my arm it was like I cut an artery and squirted out like water from a balloon. I've been searching and searching to see if anyone else has ever experienced this and to put my mind at ease that this isn't a bad sign. The nurse explained that when they do the biopsy the needle can pass through many veins. Normally they collapse and that's the end of it but if they don't it can collect blood. I have a dr. appt Tuesday but was hoping to hear my results before the weekend. Thanks for any replies!",
