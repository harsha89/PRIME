      "Content": "linzdbry wrote: Hello Ladies, I have my MRI guided core needle biopsy on Wednesday.  FREAKING OUT!  Have you flipping seen the size of that mf-ing needle?  I'm 31 and have a family history of bc.  I felt something back in June.  I went to the Dr in July who couldn't feel it but because my panic induced mother happened to get to town to take my son with her at the exact moment I was walking back to my appointment and just happened to find a way to stay- my doctor ordered a mammo and ultrasound....nothing showed up.  So, I put of going back to the follow up appt.  I eventually did-2 months later- and he still couldn't feel the spot.  But, he believed me (and had promised my mom he'd take care of me) and sent me for an MRI.  A mammo and MRI are planned for me from here on out alternating every other year because of the ridiculous amount of family history.  I emailed my doctor the morning of the MRI asking if it was really needed and he responded that it is totally up to me.  But he'd like to at least get a base line image.  I went. I hated it. I had a panic attack seconds after they put the dye stuff in and had to have it shut off for about 15 seconds.  H.A.T.E.D. IT!  (I'm getting valium this time!).  I left and felt totally overwhelmed.  I wanted off this stupid band wagon asap.  Then I got a letter a week later.  On a f*cking Saturday!  There was a suspicious area found. damn it.  I emailed my dr and found out there is a 1.9cm area on my right breast.  That's all I knew. I had another ultrasound.  The lady couldn't find it (I didn't like her. She was rude and annoyed with my questions.) She did however say that the MRI images she saw before my ultrasound had shown a good blood flow/supply to the 1.9cm area. What the hell does that mean?! Doesn't seem good.  Then she wished me a good day. yeah ok lady.  The MRI radiologist, my doctor and his nurse were all off for the week following.  Let's talk about the weekend letter I got after the 2nd ultrasound, \"It is imperative you call your doctor of the results of your ultrasound.\"  Seriously?! on a Saturday, again?  when that mean ultrasound lady already told me she couldn't find anything and no one with answers was around to answer my questions?! Did that b*itch lie to me? That was the ONLY question I had going through my head. She found something I know it. and she didn't want to say so.  I'm past that now. I trust her again. Got a call last Tuesday that I would be having an MRI guided biopsy.  The first thing I asked for were meds.  Lots of meds. GIVE ME DRUGS!  I hated that stupid MRI the first time. I want to jump ship and go back to a month ago when I was fine not knowing.  I'm having dreams of relatives who died of different cancers telling me yes it's cancer that I have but I'll be fine. Dear lord I need more sleep.  I'm told I will know the results of the biopsy the same day or the next.  Will this biopsy hurt like a mother trucker?  Have you seen the size of the needle?  For all you Dr google consultants out there, look it up. It's NOT awesome. It's like an Edward Scissor Hand's finger.  And, it's going to be shoved into my boob! The MRI tech who was with me for the last MRI said the spot is deep....great.  These are details I don't need or want to know.  Not yet anyways.  The tech is awesome, she gave me her personal number to call if I need to be talked down from freak out ledge and she rearranged her day off so she will be at my biopsy talking me through it. lol. Isn't she great?!  I'm a single mom (very single with little to no help from anyone((my mom moves back in a week however and there will be help!)) and I'm in college again.  I have plenty of distractions....until 10pm,  Then the net becomes my bff- the friend who stabs you in the back not the fun friend. Anywhos, someone, anyone, tell me how bad this biopsy with the needle from hell will hurt.  And how long it will hurt, and and and..... Log in to post a reply",
