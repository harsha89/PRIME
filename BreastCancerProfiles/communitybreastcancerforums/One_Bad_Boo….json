A photographer friend took these pictures of me during radiation in November.                 This is a picture of me I took on March 6   I used a chemical process to straighten my hair before chemo, but now I'm going to try a natural and embrace my chemo curls. I've been using Design Essentials Natural Twist & Setting lotion to help maintain my curls. This product works well with ethnic/African American hair types. This weekend I stumbled across a product called Deva Curl (The Kit for All Curl Kind) that is designed for ALL curly hair types. I'm really loving this product and Sephora carries it. Thanks to hotflashes from Tamoxifen, I'm ready to retire my wigs.",

My breast area is sore when I reach or stretch too far so I need to work on improving that. The water aerobics have been wonderful! I still have joint aches and pains in my legs and feet. The increased activity has helped so I'm going to keep at it. Traveled to Orlando for work training and took a few extra days to myself. Swam with a dolphin named Thelma and cried afterwards. I get emotional these days over the weirdest things. I can check that off my bucket list! I'm a HUGE Prince fan so I flew to Oakland to see him perform then danced until my body hurt at the after party (he made an appearance!). Got back to my hotel at 4am and flew back to Seattle by 8am. I'm doing a walk for a local non-profit in May (Wings of Karen) that funds the researchers that work where I received my treatment (Seattle Cancer Care Alliance). Next week I'm volunteering at a breast screening event for uninsured or medically underserved women. It's at the place that found my cancer during my mammogram. April 6 I'm going to be a \"survivor\" model for a fundraiser and auction to fund Wings of Karen. I'm seeing a Christian counselor who is also a survivor and she is helping me sort my way through my new normal. A woman I met during a breast cancer awareness event with the Seattle Sounders soccer team passed away while I was in Orlando. I'm really struggling with her passing. The question of \"why am I here and she's not\" keeps haunting me. With the help of my counselor I'll sort through that too. I'm so glad to read how everyone else is doing!",

RO sent me away with aquaphor and aleve. During chemo they really supported me when I talked about the side effects. A certain leafy substance is legal in my state so I'm using that to deal with the annoyance of rads and help me sleep. I'm working through it still. I'm wearing a white men's tank under a zip up hoodie so I can apply my ointments during the day and not irritate the area. The aquaphor is staining my good clothes so I feel like a slob at work. LOL Complete side note: Five coworkers have now come to me and said they think there is an issue with our building since there are four of us going through cancer (two BC, one lung, one throat). I can't get people to understand there's no relation to the four of us going through this right now. The lung cancer employee won't stop smoking but know one wants to discuss that. The throat cancer is more likely a result of HPV but I won't tell people that to protect him. My BC and the 2nd BC was just a luck of the draw. I'm just frustrated and annoyed by them all. *sigh*",

I had to take Oxycodone left over from lumpectomy to sleep. My oncologist just put me on Flexeril (muscle relaxer) and will reduce the Taxotere at chemo #2. So far the Flexeril seems to be helping. Medical and recreational marijuana is legal in my state. I've never smoked before but I tried it because the pain was getting intolerable. It seems to have helped me relax my body at night but for sure I notice a difference with using Flexeril",

I started Nov 4 and physically this is the best I've felt since my ending chemo but I'm swinging from anger to sadness. I've been on Paxil since my April diagnosis but this week it feels like it's not helping. I've been holding on to the card of a counselor who is a BC survivor and I'm on the fence about contacting her. A lot of what you all said is what I'm emotionally feeling. Was not expecting to feel this way",
