I have just completed 7 of 29 treatments and after the second treatment I could already feel some pain in the area. The area that seems to be sensitive to the radiation is under my right arm in the area where I lost a lot of lymph nodes during surgery. I get treated in three different places. The first treatment goes for about a minute and I can feel it (although I thought I imagined it). I am surprised because everything I read and was told, I probably would not have any reaction or side effects until around the 5th week. Now I am wondering what kind of pain and damage I'm in for after only 7 treatments! Thanks again for the education. I have a few questions for my oncologist on Wednesday.",
