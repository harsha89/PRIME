My doctor will not schedule surgery until they biopsy the other area but it cannot be seen by ultrasound to biopsy it.  I am now waiting for a date to have an \"operation\" to do a biopsy via MRI.  If this other area is cancer I lost my chance for lumpectomy.  Has anyone had this type of an MRI before and what do they do?  Beth Beth Dx 1/28/2009, IDC, <1cm, Stage I, Grade 1, 0/0 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
