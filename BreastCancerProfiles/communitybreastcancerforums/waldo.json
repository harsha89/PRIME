I am waiting to hear about chemo. You may want to check this link and I think there are some numbers you can call- best of luck!!! www.cancerandcareers.org/caree... ",

In addition, I am doing 2 stage reconstruction.   I am 3 weeks post op BMX and still don't have an oncotype.  I just want to be able to look back and be able to say that I did everything I could to prevent a recurrance. ",

I have not heard about Dr. Wu but I heard about a group Dr. Fitzgerald in Red Bank that are also supposed to be good.  Dr. Topmeyer is supposed to be one of the best and she only does breast cancer.  I am going for second and third opinions because I think this is the most important part of the treatment. It can get confusing if you hear all differing opinions but especially with a lumpectomygrade 3 and 2.1 cm, I would have chemo in a heartbeat.  Are you also going to have rad?",

We all have opinions and we are all coming from a different vantage point.  I had surgery 2 weeks ago and I am planning to see 3 docs- 3 opinions and I have a smaller less aggressive tumor and I am 16 years older than you I feel chemo is like insurance and I tend to want to be aggressive- I am seeing Dr. Fang (in Dr. Salwitz practice), Dr. Deborah Toppmeyer (in New Brunswick from the Cancer institute) and Dr. Peter Yi (in Princeton). All 3 are top NJ Docs.  I reallize that there is risks with chemo, but to me the potential benefits outweigh the risks. I opted for a Bilateral mastectomy and my so called healthy breast had LCIS. It was a good call on my part to be aggressive.  It is your choice but it's easier to be aggressive now while you are younger than later when you are older.  In the meantime, I would recommend you meet with either Dr. Toppmeyer or Dr. Yi,",

Which oncologist did you see?  I am in the process of setting up appointments with 3 different oncologists to hear what each has to say. ",

I still feel like I want it and will push the oncologist to order it for me.  This is the area of medicine where there is science but in the \"gray areas\" much is left to opinion and choice. But in the final analysis of things, we are the ones that ultimately have to live with the decision we make so its so important for us to make that decision based on the information we have at hand and knowing that we did all we could while weighing the risks versus the benefits.  It is so hard to make so many decisons at such a vulnerable time.  The more you verbalize the soomer you will know what you really want to do. ",

With Chemo it is risks versus benefits and these have to be weighed carefully with breast cancer and all that is known and uknown. In addition grade 1 and 3 are different and Yunlee is 37.  We don't have information about margins from surgery and I don't remeber mention of a node biopsy.  Ultimately it is her call and I believe her instinct tells her chemo is indicated and the right thing for her  otherwise she wouldn't have posted here nor gone for another opinion. Always listen to the experts and follow your instincts.  Way to go Yun Lee!!!",
