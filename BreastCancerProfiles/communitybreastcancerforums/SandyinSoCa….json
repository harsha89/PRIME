I made my decision because I did read stories such as yours and also had the opportunity to speak with women who'd gone ahead with bilateral mastectomy, as drastic as it seemed.   Your message is so very important and brought me to tears.  You'll be in my prayers.",

One way to check out a surgeon is to look up their name in the local court system to see if they've been sued for malpractice.  Even if you don't pull up anything, that doesn't mean he doesn't have any unhappy patients---as it's very difficult to get a malpractice case filed, since they are normally on contingency and attorneys are very careful when their own money is at stake.  If you do find lawsuits, at the very least you should ask the doctor what happened and let him explain.   It's awful to feel the need to check them out like this, but if you cannot get referrals from a bunch of happy patients, you need to find out as much as you can about a doctor whatever way you can.",

I guess the main thing that helped me start considering the bilateral mastectomy was the option of skin-sparing mastectomy with immediate DIEP reconstruction.   Dr. DellaCroce in New Orleans does DIEP in a way that leaves very minimal scarring, and he is revising my surgery done in L.A. so I will have the benefit of that too. ",

      "Content": "Aug 15, 2009 03:22AM SandyinSoCal wrote: Okay, the meeting was really interesting and we all learned a lot!  I'll try to answer the questions to the best of my ability, and when the video of the meeting is available, I'll let you know.  For now, this is the test of how well I paid attention.  There was supposed to be a handout, but that was apparently canceled.  (And do you know how difficult it is to keep 15 women from chatting during a lecture???  I did my best to pay close attention....) Who are candidates for this surgery? Dr. Massey feels that candidates will be those whose lifestyle is being significantly negatively impacted, like requiring three hours of therapy per day.   Of course there are other criteria, but basically, this is surgery and the long term SEs are not yet known.  It has been done for about 15 years so far. Must women with LE have tried standard treatment (Complete Decongestive Therapy) and have found it unworkable to qualify?  I believe so--she wants to see that a woman has tried standard therapies first, because management may not be enough of an imposition on the woman's lifestyle to risk surgery.  How about women who have had LE for many years? Yes, they can have it done.  Women with Stage III LE?     ?? I don't know enough about LE to answer that. Women newly diagnosed who have not tried other therapies? See above, try traditional first. Women with bilateral arm LE?  Yes. Women with truncal LE? Hasn't been done yet.  People with leg, abdominal and/or genital LE?  Has been done.  We saw a photo of a male patient who'd been treated successfully. How will research subjects be selected?  Can contact the Center for that information. What criteria will be used, and how long will they be followed for effectiveness and possible side effects?  There are several criteria, and I ignored Marga's advice to creat a cheat sheet.  I recall these: Pain, heaviness, measurements, number of infections per year...if I remember correctly, approximately three were completely subjective and three were objective.  What possible side effects will you be specifically looking at?  This meeting was not about the Center's planned study.  It was all about the various methods of lymph node transfer in the past, and about this new procedure---how it is done and why the previous methods didn't work, at least not for very long, and how people are benefitting from it. What method(s) are used for measuring and recording limb size for this study?   Tape measure? Water displacement? Perometry? Bio-impedence? Limphoscintigraphy? Self-reporting?  At what intervals will measurements be taken? QOL-specific testing? What aftercare specific to lymphedema will be used? Manual lymph drainage? Bandaging? Compression garment use? Specific or directed exercises? None? What guidelines for limb care will be given, and how will they be delivered and tracked? My understanding is that one unofficial measure of the success of this procedure is whether the patient still uses a compression garment or wrapping after the surgery, despite being directed to continue.  If the patient ends up comfortable enough to discontinue, that would seem to be an indication that the surgery was successful. What variables of treatment will be considered and figured into the research? For instance, chemo and rads as previous treatment? Type of surgery? Node involvement? Current drugs (including tamox and the AIs)? Use of Avastin (bevacizumab) and other drugs that inhibit the regrowth of vascular tissue? Weight gain or loss? Diabetes or other conditions that affect vascular function? Age? Stage of bc? Number of nodes removed? What provisions will be made in the study for tracking and recording possible development of LE from donor site involvement: leg, abdominal, genital LE? They believe that transferring no more than 3-4 lymph nodes will prevent problems in the donor site.  Preferably three.   Other thoughts?  Present was a female police officer who'd had LE in her shooting arm, and it was preventing her from being able to do her job.  She just recently had the surgery, successfully, no side effects, full resolution of the LE.  She is thrilled with her outcome. Thanks, MomsDaughter! Really important subject for all of us. LindaLou53, I would think that the way to determine that the lymphatic system is not impaired would be by lack of symptoms, correct?    Dr. Jay Granzow stopped by and talked with us for a while.  He is the surgeon who did VLNTx on the woman I mentioned above.  He said that if abdominal surgery has not been done previously, the 3 nodes would be taken from the abdomen--not the inguinal area.   If this is being done in conjunction with breast reconstruction such as DIEP, the flap is cut with a blade because cautery or suturing would damage the lymph vessels.  The nodes present in the flap fatty tissue would be the ones that would be transferred.   I'm guessing that the differences between doing a regular DIEP and a DIEP combined with VLNTx would be that the flap would be cut with a blade, and along with the main blood supply for the flap, additional blood vessels would be connected near the nodes.   Apparently, if the cut lymphatic vessels are set in close proximity, they will somehow establish connections on their own, so only the blood vessels require surgical reconnection.   I'd really like to learn a lot more about this---it's really fascinating.     In a week or two, the video will be online and then we'll all get to see how well I am remembering the presentation!  ",
