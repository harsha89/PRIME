I received results today from a core needle biopsy after suspicious calcifications were found on my mammogram. The nurse called and said they found ADH and they would do my next mammogram in six months. I've been reading all I can find out about ADH and it seems many women have excisional biopsies and see specialist physicians. Has anyone else been told they have ADH but not been recommended to have an excisional biopsy? I read that with excisional biopsy 10-20% of ADH are \"upgraded\" to DCIS and am worried. thanks so much.",

I'd done research, so I know the prognosis is very good. Now I'm waiting for results of genetic testing and then my BS and MO will discuss the treatment plan. Thank-you so much for your encouragement! It helps so very much to be able to communicate with others going through this ordeal. I don't know what I would do without it. How was your appointment with your MO? I hope all is well. Dawn",
