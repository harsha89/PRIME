Asked how was everything said it went fine. Gave me pain medicine, put on my clothes and went home. I remember it like a dream didn't have a clear mind to worried. And it was a good thing I spent a whole week recovering untill I got to see the dr again. My margins were not cleared so would need radiation but if I handle weeks and weeks of worring I think I can handle radiation. Good luck",

Second I\u2019ve seen a lot of you asking is there a chance that even thought everything points to get a cancer. Ok felt a lump around January. Went to the DR and sent me to get an ultrasound in 2 weeks. I found the lump on my inner right breast and it felt big, hard like a part of my chest bone. I couldn\u2019t wait 2 weeks and got the ultrasound at a radiologist center where they do cheap mammograms and ultrasounds. Short story at the end of the ultrasound the radiologist told me to sit down. He said you need to RUN home and make an appointment with an oncologist for tomorrow!!!! OMG my world fell apart. I had a BIRADS 4 highly suspicious mass. When to see an oncologist the next day and told me that yes it look suspicious and needed a biopsy to be sure. Got into a breast cancer navigation program and got a core needle biopsy done. Results back in 5 days. I have a \u201cGranular Cell Tumor\u201d Granular cell tumors are tumors that start in primitive (early) nerve cells. They are rarely found in the breast. Most are found in the skin or the mouth, but they are uncommon even in those places. They are almost always benign. A granular cell tumor of the breast can most often be felt as a firm lump that you can move, but some may be attached to the skin or chest wall. They are usually about ½ to 1 inch across and are most often found on the upper, inner part of the breast. Granular cell tumors are sometimes thought to be cancer when they are found on a clinical breast exam because they are firm, especially if they are fixed in place. They may also look like cancer on a mammogram. A fine needle or core needle biopsy can tell them apart from cancers. This tumor is usually cured by removing it along with a small margin of normal breast tissue around it. Granular cell tumors are not linked to a higher risk of having breast cancer later in life. On July 2nd would have my 2nd appointment with the surgeon to have a lumpectomy. The surgeon has 21 years of experience and has never seen a tumor like this. (All the doctors, nurses etc also have never seen this tumor before). By looking at my ultrasound and mammogram everybody was almost sure that I had cancer and the aggressive kind.  I\u2019m so lucky to have been diagnosed with this. I will lose part of my breast but at the end thank God I will be fine. Hope that my story gives you hope and good luck to all of you.
