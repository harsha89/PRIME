Does anyone know if because of the chemo I would get nose bleeds? Everytime I blow my nose it is pink or red. Most of my nose hairs are gone but I dont know if this is why the nose bleeds. Start over the holiday weekend so I havent talk to doctors yet. Any thoughts on this would be appreciated. Candice Candice -Staying Positive!!! Doing Great!!

I have been going threw this all very fast. I stated this Feb 2011 with finding a lump. March told BC then May told it was stage IV met. This Friday I have a check CT scan done. I find myself thinking about what I want to do in my life, much of which is involiving my 6 year old daughter. I find that there is really very little I want to do for just me. These stupid mets are in my leg which makes it difficult to get around, the pain pills make me flighty and sometimes forgetful. My mother in law is here to help clean and sort and has been here for 12 days and is driving me and hubby crazy.  She goes on rants about what she did 25 years ago, like we care that she only drank coke cola and got headaches then. Yes she is cleanning but she also keeps hubby up late and it is giving him mygrain headaches. He has other things he would like to do but even tho she is here to help she is insisting on him helping her do things. I think it would be easier if he didnt have to deal with her. Again she did clean thurally. If I could move good I could get all the things done over time. But I cant move. I am thinking of writing my daughter notes for when she is older, regardless of if I am alive or not. Would it be better in print or saved on a USB drive? Ok I know I am ranting, and I am sorry. See my other post on happy thoughts I will bump it so it is near this post for a while. Or check out my posts. Candice Candice -Staying Positive!!! Doing Great!!
