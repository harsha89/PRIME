I have been through a lot, not only with cancer scares, but years of drugs and surgeries for infertility. Just remember you need to get through it to get the answers you need. The mammo techs are usually great at relieving your anxiety. Since you are not feeling well to begin with, I know it adds to your fears. You can do it, I know you can! IF they see something, then they will sonogram you. But again, I urge you to get an MRI if you can.",

One of my incisions is right around my nipple and is of course more sore than the other, which is straight out at 3 o'clock and about 2\" long. That is the \"suspicious\" one. Did I tell you all that the original spot that started this whole mess was a STITCH from my breast lift in 2004??? It felt like a little bb, they thought it was scar tissue, but took it out to be sure, and it was a stitch! But if not for that little stitch, I would have never had an MRI that led me here. So whatever Mayo Clinic finds, I would have never been the wiser, and if it is bad news, I definitely caught it early because of that little bugger. I am better today, probably because I cried last night very hard and for a very long time. You all have been so great and so helpful. THANK YOU. I will keep you posted.

My surgeon is Dr. Richard Brenner with Va Surgery Associates!! I will be at Fair Oaks Hospital. I have heard nothing but great things about the whole group, my primary loves them, my gyn referred me to them when I found the lump, and the nurse who did my pre-op raved. Actually I guess you said you are now going to a ps. I would be happy to have mine removed and reconstructed. I would love to stay in touch with you. My e-mail is haagmiller@mac.com. Any advice on where I turn if I get bad news? Did you go through chemo or rads? My gyno also retired 2 wks after he referred me, and now I don't have a gyno either. My husband hasn't been the greatest. He would rather watch football than help distract me this wkd. So I just went to Target and spent a bunch of money on unnecessary stuff, although I did find a bra. I hope to talk to you soon! Kim",

My biopsy was the day before Thanksgiving, so she said it will be a little longer - probably the beginning of this week. I called yesterday and the nurse called back around 3 and said typically results take 2-3 business days, so figure on a call later today or early Wed. Well, no call today so I expect a call tomorrow or I am going to raise hell. It's the way things go with me. In 2006 I had a mole taken off my leg and it took 3 wks to get the results because they finally had to send it to a professor at the University of Miami, apparently a highly respected pathologist. No one could make a decision what it was because it had all of the characteristics of melanoma, BUT it was perfectly round. I still had to have a wide excision and now have a lovely scar on my leg, but no melanoma. So they are still probably looking at my whacky cells under the scope and wondering what the hell they are...... I hope to have news tomorrow. I appreciate your comments and I appreciate this board.",

My treatment largely depends on the genetic results. I just found out my LCIS (if that is even what it is - the diagnosis has changed twice and gotten worse each time) is \"multi-focal\". So at the very least I need a re-excision or a possible mastectomy. Explaining this to people has been difficult. I guess when they hear you have breast cancer they expect you to have immediate removal of the monster and your hair to fall out right away.

I posted on the hormone therapy board about body aches because I wasn't sure if I had an infection or it was an SE of the tamoxifen. The body aches have been better, although whenever I say that, they seem to come back. My surgeon seemed adamant about the fact that I could not get an infection \"at this point\" and said that he had let me know that I would feel this way and that I was to stay inactive. All I can say is that he must have another patient with my same name or that looks just like me, cuz I remember no such conversation about staying inactive \"not even to gesture\" for this amount of time. When I told him he hadn't had that conversation with me, he apologized and once again told me to not use my left arm for 2 wks. Ladies, I have gone from working out with a trainer 3 times a wk, bicycling 4 times a week and walking, running and weight lifting ( I can/could chest press on a balance ball 25 lb dumbbells, one in each hand) to DOING NOTHING. And he tells me the amount of fluid I have and the way I feel leads him to believe I have been \"too active\". Maybe I underestimated the lumpectomy and the amount of tissue removed, but I am also not a wimp and I feel like a big baby. I hate being so inactive. But like everyone says, for right now I guess this is my \"new normal\". Anyway, yes, I am feeling better, but I am sick of sports bras and dressing to conceal my gigantic boob. We are going on spring break and I have no idea what to pack, but in the big picture I feel really, really lucky. Thank you again to all of you wonderful ladies for your comments and concern. I always know where to come when I need to. Kim p.s. I have been using cabbage leaves on my breast for relief of the fluid and pressure and I think it has worked. Any questions I would be glad to fill you in.....",

No one can know until the specimen is under a microscope exactly what it is, so don't concern yourself with cancer or grades right now.  There is no way to know at this point.  It makes me mad when medical professionals speak before they should.  And REMEMBER - 80% of biopsies come back benign!!  If the only thing they saw on the MRI was this mass to be biopsied, then yes, it would appear that is the only \"area of concern\" right now.  My best to you - please let us know what happens.  PM me if you want to ask more questions about the biopsy.

This protection is critical, since testing for a specific genetic mutation commonly associated with breast cancer can lead to early detection and treatment \u2013 saving countless lives. Now we have great news. More than 16,000 of you sent letters to your Senators in support of GINA, and it paid off! Thanks to your support, the Senate unanimously passed GINA last night (Thursday, April 25) and now the bill just needs approval from the House and the signature of the President \u2013 both of which are expected to happen quickly. GINA prohibits discrimination by health insurers and employers on the basis of genetic information. So now, thanks to GINA, women who would otherwise have avoided genetic testing because they feared discrimination \u2013 thus being denied information that could help them manage their health or their family's health \u2013 will have protections under federal law.  The passage of GINA is an important step that presents a great opportunity to promote personalized medicine and the use of genetic information in healthcare. This will lead to better research and development for new targeted drugs and treatments, which will save lives. GINA will become the law of the land.  And you helped make it possible. Thank you for your efforts, Diane Balma Susan G. Komen for the Cure Advocacy Alliance It sure looks to me like you have enough family history to be tested! Just my opinion.... Kimber",

I'm not sure I can handle seeing myself that way... I have said all along I do not want cancer to make this decision for me.  With a mother, sister, and aunt all having bc, and my sister at 46, I just feel like it is only a matter of time.  Why not do it while I am young and healthy??  I feel like I am on a fence and just need a nudge to fall to the preventative side.  Sounds very silly when you put it in writing and think about it as strictly preventative.  SO many women here have done it and have been happy.  I am so sick of monitoring and the stress of biopsies before every holiday season..... Sorry once again to vent....this is a big decision for me.  How long will I be laid up?  How long will I need help with my kids?  I RUN my household - my husband can't even stand for me to have a cold.  How long does the process take??? Thanks sisters, I am in a weird place right now.... Kimber  Strong family history, Prophylactic Bilateral Mastectomies 1/19/2010, Under \"reconstruction\" for 6 months.... DONE! HAPPY!

I tend to get sick from general and had no probs with MAC. Do you have some valium or something to take for your wire localization? It really is not that bad, but you are left in the mammo machine for quite a while and I found that my chest hurt in the middle in the following days, I presume from being pulled away for so long. Good luck and let us know how it goes! Kimber",
