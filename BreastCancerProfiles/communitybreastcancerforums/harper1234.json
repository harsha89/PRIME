    "Content": "harper1234 wrote: For 3 weeks I have been experiencing soreness and some pain in my left breast, with pain radiating into my shoulder and shoulder blade. The pain in my back is more bothersome than the breast pain. I'm sore up into my armpit also. No redness, no rash, no itching, no skin changes that I can detect. I also have noticed slight swelling in my arm pit area, upper arm, and breast. I went to my OB/GYN he ordered a mammo and ultrasound. Both were normal. Lymph node in my arm was around 2 cm. I was referred to a surgeon and he said he saw no signs of breast cancer but had no idea what was causing my pain. So I went for a second opinion and second surgeon did another ultrasound and said he sees nothing but can't say why I'm having pain and soreness. Maybe a pinched nerve or pulled muscle. I have very small breast and he said that because of that he seen no reason to do an MRI. He said he could see the difference in size but it wasn't that much of a difference. I'm 48 years old and have not had a period for at least a year. I'm just at a loss. Any ideas of what this may be would be greatly appreciated. It's just a nagging pain! I guess my next step is maybe an orthopedic dr?? Any suggestions?? Log in to post a reply",
