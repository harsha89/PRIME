I just kep hoping I'd be one of the few that'd get by with minimal hair loss and it doesn't look to be the case. I'm to afraid to as DH to shave I'm afraid it'll make it too real. Yes I'm in denial. michellej1980- I actually noticed those hairs coming off in abundance before major falling on head. That did bother me as much though bc I've always waxed so its a money saver lol. Although it does server to reinforce what our bodies are going through. Also I start my period today... It was right on time but I wasn't expecting to have it during chemo. Any thoughts?",

Today if even run my fingers through it I get clumps. I had cut my a few weeks ago from shoulders to a bob hoping it'd help. Also keeping it up in a loose clip so that I'm not tempted to touch. I think I've lost about 30% so far. Is there anything I can do???? Shampoos, herbs, meds, anything??? I'm afraid this will be just as bad as loosing my breast and not being able to finish recon until after chemo. I'm sorry I'm ranting but no one understands and I met with comments lik \"it's only hair it'll grow back\". NO **** it'll grow back but I want it now! I know I should vain but its so upsetting. A little side note..... This maybe TMI but land hair down there fell out really quick...no waxing is something I can definitely appreciate.",
