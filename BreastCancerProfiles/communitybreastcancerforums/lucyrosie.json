When I asked how come I couldn't feel it how could I have found it they showed me a dimple in my breast.  I would follow through and get a 2 nd opinion from a breast cancer expert just to be sure. One kind of cancer is like a spider web not a lump.  Do t worry . Be aggressive and make sure you are satisfied. Don't be afraid.  I am fine now and feel lucky I found it early ",

My sister's often had lumps and biopsy s and nothing ever came of them this was my first one at 51.  I pretended how I would feel if it came back cancer.  When it did I think I had prepared by pretending.  In the end I felt I was lucky that they found it.  I took the whole thing with the feeling that I am lucky to be alive now in this time when cancer can sometimes be treated like a chronic illness.   What is already is.  Knowing it didn't change it but gives us a chance to do our very best to deal with it, take some proactive actions and free us from fear of the unknowns.  I hope it is nothing for you. This forum is a great place to go to to express your fears.  All my love to you and good luck",
