I found the haze feeling lasted about 5 days, but it did end and I did feel more normal and could function. Maybe call your doctor (that is what they are there for) and check on you nausea meds. Maybe they can give you something else. Hang in there! Lauren",

This does not to be something we can do and the loss of control is one of the hardest things to accept . I had an absolute toddler meltdown at the infusion center today over a similar issue ( loss of control, change in plans....ugh). This is such a difficult process to deal with, I just hate it all! Guess we both have to keep the faith and get this mess over with! From what I can tell, we are about the same age as are our kids...maybe that's our problem, Ha! Lauren",
