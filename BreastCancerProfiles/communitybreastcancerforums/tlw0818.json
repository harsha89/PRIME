Hopefully once my operation date comes through this will subside?? GB1921, understand totally that fear...once you know it\u2019s there you just want it out! Quick question....can you request from your surgeon that they take a larger margin in the first place to save then having to possibly go back in again? The thought of that (for me) is greater than just losing the breast completely? ",

Had a phone call yesterday to ask if it was convenient...err YES! Really glad it's come through so quickly.....lots of emotions/anxieties creeping in again.. Still, only a week to wait this time! How quickly will I be up and around after the op? General anaesthetic normally wipes me out for a good 1-2wks..I\u2019ve been given exercises to do straight after the op...?",

It\u2019s just the waiting.....waiting for test results, waiting for diagnosis, now waiting for hospital date for operation. They\u2019ve said it will be within 2-3 wks, which I suppose is quick, but to me....feels like forever away? Just want the treatment started....then I can see an end to it all....mentally coming to terms with it all is the hardest I think. Have met my surgeon and he has explained what will be happening.....I will see him again on the morning of surgery. So sorry you are going through this too....Life is a shit sometimes huh?
