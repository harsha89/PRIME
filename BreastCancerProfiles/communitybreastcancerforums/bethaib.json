My onc said some rads docs say no, some say it's ok. I didn't want to deal with not knowing which one was giving me side effects if I had developed any, and I wanted to give myself some time to deal with rads before dealing with Tamox. So I waited till I finished rads. I stopped rads on a Friday and started Tamox on Sunday. Like everything else about BC, it is your decision after the docs have weighed in. What are you comfortable with?",

I kidded I felt like Madonna lol   I had my husband and sister waiting with me, so I spent my time talking to them. I don't believe cell phone use was permitted as I was in a holding area near the surgery room. But I am not sure what it would like for you. I would imagine you coulr read if you wanted. They would just keep the book with your clothes I would think. Not sure how much help this is... You should have been given a number you can call to contact someone with your questions? I know I called the biopsy place twice before mine. They were very nice, patient, and were happy to answer my questions.",

I am currently seeing a dermatologist for a mole on my face that is \"new\" Had tons of them for years, but this one has bleed and peeled. Took a section and had it biopsied. Benign thank goodness, but get any you are concerned about checked ASAP. Wouldn't you rather know there is nothing to worry about?",

She said they placed the rads to have the absolute least possible exposure to the lungs. We certainly don't breathe the same during every single treatment, I know they watch that as everyone is more nervous their first couple days. My rad doc said she would have adjusted my rads if my breathing continued as it was. So I would think it is feasible the rads could have something to do with what is going on with you now. Perhaps you should seek another opinion? Or maybe someone will answer that has dealt with this...",
