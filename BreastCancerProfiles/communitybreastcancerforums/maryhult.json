A/C and Taxol, I finished in Mar '07.  I had bi-lat mast/reconst  (expanders) in May.  I was not supposed to have rads but the path report said otherwise, it put the orig tumor at over 5cm.  I had my implant exchange July 30 and started rads 2 weeks later.  I have 4 left(yeah!!!!).  So far so good.  Normal reactions ie redness, slight swelling and breaking out.  I made sure throughout the whole process I massaged expanders with cocoa butter.  After implants you have to squeeze from the bottom up real hard and hold it there for a count of 10.  This helps to break up scar tissue.  I am using pure aloe gel now and that seems to be working fine.  I hope this will help you.  Good luck Mary Ann",

I had my implant exchange today and I am doing terrible. There is so much pain and my sternum is killing me. I can hardly breathe due to the bandage. Couple of questions..everything has been going great all along accept for today. I left the surgery center with no idea what I should/shouldn't do. I have no idea what to expect or if I should start stretching my arms. I go Friday for my rad simulation and I cant even lift my arm now. I start rads in 2 weeks. I have been excersing in preparation for it but what good will that do me now. My radiologist wants it Friday because she is going away on vacation and I truly like her. Its just the way things worked out. Although I have a lot of confidence in my ps surgeon I almost feel neglected. He even thought I was having saline when in fact I chose silicone. So if someone can give me some insight I would appreciate it. Thanks Mary Ann Log in to post a reply",
