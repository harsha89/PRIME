I felt like I was being weak today when I called the clinic and asked if the doc would prescribe something (he offered last week). He was happy to do it. I am getting more and more anxious as \"B\" Day approaches (I'm calling it B-day for Biopsy or Boob, whichever).  Anyway, I agree that you don't need to be calming other people down.  You need to worry about YOU.  Your friends and family should be pampering you and there for you whatever you need.  I had a problem with a very unsupportive close family member and have decided to stop saying anything about all of this. My friends are very supportive- they are my family. Do what's best for you, and good luck!",

      "Content": "Kadie wrote: I've been posting under Biopsy for Fibroadenoma but wanted to start a new link about the radiology report, since I finally received mine today.  The doctor didn't even review it with me. The radiologist, following the diagnostic US, did tell me both masses appeared to be fibroadenomas. Actually, he was convinced of one and not so certain of the other, saying the only way to know was to do a biopsy.  I picked up the written report today and discovered I was assigned a BIRAD-4.  I understand that means \"low to moderate probability (23-34%) of cancer\" based on what I read on reliable websites.   No doctors explained this to me.  The report described the one mass as having \"well circumscribed margins with hyperechoic foci internally suggestive of calcifications... somewhat atyptical for fibroadenoma lesion [because it] appears taller than wide.\"  To me, this means they're not really certain what I have is a fibroadenoma.  So I went from being slightly worried to being not at all worried (when radiologist and doctor, over the phone, mentioning the report seemed to indicate that it's a fibroadenoma just needing to be verified by biopsy) to being fairly concerned again.  I have the biopsy on the 15th, told I'd have results by the 22nd.

I'm just curious, because I'm scheduled for a core biopsy this Friday and am wondering if they call to say it's B9 or cancer.  I plan to pick up my reports, too, and didn't like the way it was handled after the US. The radiologist came to talk to me and show me 2 masses and explain one was a fibroadenoma, the other very like one too but only way to know for sure is to biopsy.  Then a week later, I picked up the report and read all the details and wondered why no one explains all the jargon to us.",
