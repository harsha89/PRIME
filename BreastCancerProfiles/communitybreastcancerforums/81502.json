I just called the American Society of Clinical Oncology (which is where this 'news' supposedly came from) to find out if this is true. ASCO is having their annual convention (ending today) and I have read thru virtually all of the topics discussed on their website and can't find one thing about the ineffectiveness of anthracyclines. Someone at ASCO is supposed to call me back and let me know where Brian Williams' information came from and I'll post whatever info I get.",
