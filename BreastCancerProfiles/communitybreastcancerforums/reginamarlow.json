They said I have a lump and need an ultrasound and mammogram. I can't seem to find any resources to help me get the necessary tests, I'm broke and have no medical insurance. I have a high risk of breast cancer in my family, from grandparents, to aunts to cousins who have had it. I am scared and worried and need to find out if there is a resource to help me get the tests I need! If anyone has any suggestions, please give it! Thank you! Log in to post a reply",
