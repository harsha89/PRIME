All I can add is this -- two weeks after my diagnosis of Stage IV, I came down with Shingles of the face. It was truly horrific. I have a pic and will try to find to share! It was not painful! But, I was taking strong pain meds for newly diagnosed pain mets. I would definitely recommend the vaccine. It took three months before I would leave my house. ",

I've posted a few times in other areas, but never here. I have mets to my bones and liver. My liver is progressing and I've done 7 different types of chemos. None are working so next steps are Clinical Trials, if any are available at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. My question: do any of you get extremely tired and need to sleep a lot? I am in between Docs so I'm feeling very nervous right now and would love to hear any suggestions! I certainly pray, read what's latest in news and read discussion boards as much as I can. But the side effects from this disease is making me go crazy! Bev",

I was diagnosed Stage IV in 9/2014 -- severe mets to bone, pelvis, rib, skull, and a few nodules to liver. It's the Liver that worries me but so good to read all of you survivors of Stage IV. I was diagnosed ER/PR+ HER- in 2007. I am now on Ibrance, which is new to me as of a few weeks ago. Bev",
