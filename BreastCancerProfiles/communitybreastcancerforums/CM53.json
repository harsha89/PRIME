Yikes ... I asked my oncologist what she would do if she was me and that's when she said she would. I met with my surgeon the very next morning due to superficial veins below the Breast extending into the abdomen, it freaked me out and the oncologist too (she recommended I see my surgeon right away so I did) turns out that it's a uncommon problem called Mondor's syndrome. I spoke with the surgeon about the Chemo and since I'm getting radiation and hormones therapy she felt that Chemo was not beneficial. You are absolutely right, I'm so glad I came across this site, don't feel so alone and everyone is so supportive",
