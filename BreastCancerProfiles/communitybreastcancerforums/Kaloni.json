I have been so busy with LIFE! Sue how are you doing? I hope your doing good. Well, As of today, it is 3 years being a Survivor. It is a long journey. But, we manage to keep going...For all you sweet   ladies still going through treatment. Always keep Positive. Keep God above with you always. And, remember my Breastcancer Motto: \"Hold on, and, Keep your Strength, Keep your  Faith, and, Keep your Hope.\" You too will get there. That light will start peaking through little by little each day. God Bless Love, Kaloni",

I work and work it seems. And, now, I am taking care of my other half. Mike had a collapse lung. Not good. He is better now, and at home. But, he still is in alot of pain. So, I have been giving him good care. Boy! He can be stubborn though. Well, I am off and running again. Just a little peep. I will do my best to keep more in touch with you lovely ladies. Bye now. God Bless You All, Love, Kaloni ",
