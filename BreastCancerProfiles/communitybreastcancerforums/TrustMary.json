I did that and then was told that they looked like they were shrinking and now come back yearly for mammos. Had one last May and it was normal (so thet said). My fault, I felt a lump under my arm but ignored it because I was convinced it was nothing as I did not feel anything in my breast and I felt confident I was fine do to the normal mammo. That was last summer. In December I felt lump in my left breast and immediately went to see breast surgeon. after ultrasound, he said it was breast cancer and then followed by needle biopsy and MRI. I had mastectomy two weeks ago and yesterday I had to go for CT scan and bone scan as 16 out of 20 lymph nodes were positive. I am a nervous wreck waiting for the results. Please pray for me.",

In January of 2011, I had left breast mastectomy. The removal of 20 lymph nodes of which 19 were positive for cancer. I underwent 8 rounds of chemo and 28 weeks of radiation. After finishing treatments, I started taking Arimidex and it has been working up until recently. Last November my tumor marker went up to 40. A repeat test was done in February and it went up another 15 points. My oncologist became alarmed and sent me for Pet/Cat scan which showed a small spot in my right hip joint. I had a bone biopsy and met with my oncologist yesterday who gave me the bad news that it came back positive . I am 66 yrs old. I have 6 children and 5 grandchildren. I still work and keep very active. I will be starting Aromasin daily. Xgeva shots once per month and Afinitor daily. I would appreciate it if any of you are on the same regiment, if you respond what side effects you might have or have had while taking these. I got very sick from chemo and I am worried that iIwill be having bad side effects. I am very upset over this new turn of events. I will be looking forward to your comments. Thank you and God bless you. Dx 12/19/2010, ILC, 6cm+, 20/22 nodes, ER+ Log in to post a reply",
