My last surgery for this year with my left breast removed Dec 4th with expander put in and chemo port installed ready for medicine on January 3rd! Still have my drain from surgery, it has finally started slowing down. Hope to have removed this Wed!! I will start 12 weeks of Taxol then Herceptin! Taxol once a week and Herceptin once every 3 weeks for 9 months! How did Taxol affect others? My oncologist said it was very mild and I should be just fine. I know chemo affects everyone differently but any info will be much appreciated! Merry Christmas! We all have lots to be thankful for!",
