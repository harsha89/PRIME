I am writing to hopefully ease some anxiety from those awaiting surgery this month. I went into the surgery knowing everything I needed to know but not more than that. Honestly, there were some scary parts: saying goodbye to family as they wheeled me to surgery, being alone in the operating room and waking up after anaesthesia. I was really nauseous when I woke up and was throwing up before I even realized anything. I was in a lot of pain but the morphine stepped in quickly and eased it. The first night is rough, your chest feels very heavy and it is painful to change positions and to get up. But it is so important to get up and move. I forced myself to get up and go to the bathroom and was so happy I did, because it helped me to heal quicker. The painkillers made me nauseous so as of the second day I was only taking Tylenol. I took it every 4 hours for the first two days, I never waited for the pain to hit first. I tried to walk around the house every few hours, so as never to get stiff. I didn't stress myself out with showers, I bought Huggies wipes and washclothes and my husband and my mom took turns giving me sponge baths. I will be honest sleeping was the worst cause it's hard to get really comfy but I found keeping pillows under my arms helped. The drains are a pain but you learn what works for you. For me I wore tank tops that were 3 sizes too big and I pinned the drains to the outside of them so they were never touching my skin. I wore my husbands button down sweaters or hoodies to cover them. By day six I went on my first outing to the hairdresser. Two weeks later I am doing well. I am still sore and uncomfortable but I'm not sure if that will go away as long as I have these expanders?? Anyways, I am not waiting to get back to normal, because normal was with my old breasts. I am just trying to do things I would've done before and not focus on the discomfort, cause I can't change that!!",

Prior to the surgery I spoke to a few people who had done it before but then decided I heard enough. Everyone has a different experience and I didn't want any other experiences to scare me or put the wrong ideas in my head. The important thing to know is that you will be OK. Be prepared that the first few days will be different than what you've experienced so far but you will be shocked to see how your body recovers and how quickly you will start to feel strong again. The best advice to prepare yourself is to enlist some help for the first few days and let them do things for you. Everything else will fall into place and you will heal :) If you have specific questions you can msg me.  RHGSR - You asked about exercise. I wanted to share, after my first AC I began going to pilates and discovered it was the BEST thing for me, it has saved me. I was feeling weak and useless and it gave me strength and confidence. I found a private pilates instructor that is trained in rehabilitation and has had cancer herself. Since January I have been seeing her 1-2 times per week. She is always able to gear the class around my strength that day. Sometimes we just do stretching other times a full workout. It is fantastic, wakes up all of my muscles and puts me back in control. It is a great way to work out while being gentle and kind to your body. The downside is its expensive but so so worth it. Seriously, it's amazing. ",

Last year I complained of rib pain and after bone and CT scan was told I had 2 rib fractures (but can't recall injuring them). Then about 10 months later I had another bone and CT scan and the spots were still there, slightly more intensified but the report came back saying it was fractures once again. My MO sent me for bone density scan and while the technician told me I was just bordering osteoporosis but nothing to worry about my MO told me I do have osteoporosis (I am only 33 btw) and that most likely explains the rib fractures. Now a few months later my ribs still, nothing excruciating but every time I feel it I just hope nothing was missed. Am I being too crazy?",

He said it didnt seem \"serious\" and could just be a gland, but that's also what he said about my original tumour. He said to just watch it and to go back in 4 months or sooner if it gets any bigger. It wasn't very reassuring but also not negative. Does this sound right? ",

However I was getting AC every 3 weeks so I miss that week before chemo where I felt really good. I find with Taxol since it's every week I don't have many of those days where I feel great because of my lack of energy.  Throughout this process I have also been organizing a gestational surrogacy pregnancy. My husband and I do not have children and were planning to start our family around the time I was diagnosed. So prior to chemo we froze our embryos. We have been lucky enough to find a wonderful gestational surrogacy. Our only roadblock now is genetic testing. I have the BRCA 2 gene and we are able to test our embryos prior to implanting them for the gene. It's pretty impressive what we can do these days. The only issue is that it is time consuming, it can take up to 12 weeks to prepare the testing. My surrogate is anxious to get started and so am I, but it is so worth it to do the testing, right? Opinions anyone?",

It was worse a month ago, got better, almost went away completely when I had an oophorectomy and now it seems to have come back but very dull. It is tender to the touch and hurts like a bruise. I think it might be from my tissue expander but I have had them over a year and haven't filled them in over 6 months, so why now? It is also on the side where I had my tumour. I am having a bone scan next week but I just want to be prepared. What does bone mets feel like? Is it a constant pain? Or does it go away and come back? ps.
