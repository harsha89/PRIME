My rad onc told me that people have hundreds of lymph nodes altogether, and there is no uniformity about how they are distributed. In your case they found something in the sentinel node and dissected five more to see if it had progressed further, which apparently it hadn't. Since you had a mastectomy, your doctor has concluded that radiation is not necessary.  It is possible that your six nodes were taken out automatically simply because they were located in the underarm breast tissue, in which case you didn't have a full axillary node dissection.  Look at the description of mastectomy on this site and you will see how this can happen.",

Since I don't know exactly which genes they test or what their individual signifcance is, I can't say.  They should be able to tell you more  What I meant by your score being influenced by how negative your score was is that the test reports HER2 status on a numerical scale from 7.5 to 13.0, with positive starting at 11.5. This leaves a possible range for negative scores from 7.5  up to 10.7, at which point a narrow strip of \"inconclusive\" scores begins. I would assume that if your negative score was 10.7, this would give you a higher overall recurrence score than a negative score of 7.5. I was told that the HER2 score comprises 47% of the total recurrence score, so a mere 2 points higher on the HER2 scale might translate to17 points higher on the hundred point scale that indicates risk of recurrence. I don't, of course, know exactly how the overall score is calculated, but I don't think they would report a range of socres for ER, PR, and HER2, which they do, if the range of scores had no bearing on the overall score. .",

This happens in only 4-5% of cases, but the stakes are very high. In Meg's case A makes more sense than it would in yours, given the fact that she is Stage III and triple negative. However, A is generally most effective against Her2+ tumors. I don't know of any evidence that AC is more potent than TC, and ACT or AC+T are just ways of fudging the issue--if you include both, no one can be sure which one (if either) is more effective. I believe a clinical trial is underway which compares them head to head. Both do have side effects, but if your onco monitors your treatment carefully you should get the right dose for your body weight. You are also ER+, which means that you can respond to hormonal systemic therapy, so chemo is not the only weapon in your arsenal. A second opinion might be a good idea.",

The blood counts were (as expected) somewhat low, but only the white blood count was notably low, and he didn't think it was low enough to worry about. He's still a bit disgruntled about my not doing chemo, and wants to see me again in three months, which is fne with me.. Will see my rad onc next week, and  will probably have the port out  shortly. I haven't experienced fatigue, exactly, but I have noticed that I don't have as much stamina as I had before I was DXd. Ii'm hoping this is only temporary.  My skin has almost returned to normal, and I've been on Femara for a month with no appreciable side effects.  My onc thinks that if I haven't had any yet I probably won't have any, though I've heard of some showing up later. I like the idea of a \"post\" thread.",

I did my simulatioin last Thursday and supposedly started treatments on Monday, but most of you seem to have had an easier time getting started than I had. Since I have arthritis in both shoulders, the arm position is uncomfortable for me.  I'm OK for about five minutes, and then the trouble starts. Well, the simulation took at least an hour, and they spent at least forty minutes of the first treatment session trying to adjust the marks. Because the simulation was so uncomfortable, I took some of the pain medication thay gave me for the surgeries, which I had never needed, before the second session, but it didn't help at all. In fact this session was worse than the simulation, to the point of being unbearable. Before the third session I took two Norcos--no nonsense this time. Again they kept fiddling with the marks for about forty minutes, but this time I merely got numb instead of feeling like I'd been crucified, so the Norco helped. Today, at last, they were satisfied, and we breezed through the session in fifteen minutes. But I'm planning to continue taking Norco until I'm sure I'm safe. They gave me some kind of gel for skin irritation, rather than a lotion. It dries quickly. They also provided a special deoderant. They recommend cornstarch for chafing and moisture, which seems to work very well. The mystery of why hospitals and treatment centers can't afford to provide gowns which fit human beings persists here, but today I had one that *almost* fit, so somewhere there must be some that are wearable.",

      "Content": "Feb 14, 2009 04:17PM - edited Feb 15, 2009 01:39PM by Seabee I am envious of most of you. I had one treatment which lasted less than half an hour.  The rest have been at least 30 or 40 minutes long.  When they aren't fiddling with my marks they are taking x-rays, and they take a lot of them. One technician  told me that they were having trouble fitting the fields to my breast, because of the way the onc had set the blocks, and that he had changed his settings to make the fit easier.  She also said they were trying to avoid hitting my lung, though they were hitting about a centimeter of it, which she said was \"normal.\" I told her I was glad they were being careful, but I hoped they could be careful a bit faster. I keep getting told that the treatments will get easier and faster, but I'm skeptical. And since they are constantly bustling around me doing something I can't see, I doubt that I can relax or think about something else, as some of you are doing. But at least the gown problem has been solved.  On Thursday I unfolded and rejected two of them, vowing that I would not wear anything too small. But the third, a relatively new one, actually fit! They offered to put it in a bag with my name on it, and I agreed, since by the end of treatment it will get a day's wear or less, and such a rare find shouldn't be underestimated. On Friday it took only 5 minutes to change into the gown. ",

The area under the breast is particularly sore and has a small break in the skin. The onc prescribed some cortisone and antibiotic creams which I'm trying out, starting last night. So far the cortisone cream seems to be the most helpful. Otherwise I have little to complain about. I haven't had an attack of fatigue since the middle of week 3. The simulation for the boosts was completed yesterday in record time, so I now have four additionanl rads graffiti. The simulation took extra time, and so required some minor rescheduloing, but that was no problem.  My only logistical problem so far has centered on the changing rooms. The appoitments are scheduled very close together, and the person treated after me insisted on using the same changing room I use, even lthough there are two of them and they are identical. Once she opened the door on me,  forcing me to figure out how to lock it. (It has a tricky latch.) At another time she sat and waited, looking put out, while I finished dressing, totally ignoring the other room, even though, as far as I could see, she hadn't stowed anything in the room I was in. Finally I got tired of dealing with her and moved to the other room myself. I can only hope that I finish treatments before she develops a sudden urge to switch rooms.",

I now have some dead skin under my treated breast which is turning white and peeling, leaving some raw, red patches exposed. My onco prescribed an antibiotic cream (silver sulfadiazine) to prevent infection. I apply the cream, and then cover the raw patches with a non-stick absorbant pad. The pad is pretty well held in place by the breast, but wearing a comfortable soft cotton bra also helps secure it. The antibiotic cream and the smooth surface of the pad allow the breast to move somewhat without being irritated. Tape is definitely out. Breast skin seems to be very thin--at least mine is. Tape can cause it to tear and bleed even when it is in normal condition. These non-stick patches are probably not as comfortable as a gel patch, but once in place they do much better than anything else I've tried.",

Yesterday I tried an experiment and mixed the Silvadine with an over-the-counter antibiotic cream that had an added pain killer. That seemed to help, as least in increasing my comfort level. The dead skin continues to slough off, but the whole area can still be covered with a 3x4 patch. My underarm area has started peeling a bit also, but so far no raw spots. It stays dryer. The boosts are no problem. In fact the boosted area looks better than the rest of the breast. And I have only ONE boost to go and I'm done! Forever, I hope, both with rads and with BC. The nurse told me today that I should try to keep the area dry, and I told her that at the moment the antibiotic cream and an absorbent pad was the best I could do. Evidently she's never had my type of breast. She said I could probably figure out when to stop using the cream and switch to more emphasis on keeping it dry. We'll see if she's right. Right now, my instinct and experience tell me that exposing the raw spots to air would hurt. What we have are basically second-degree burns, and the treatment is pretty much the same.",

You're right that all oncs don't agree, however.  Jeanne_D--It is true that women with node involvement have a somewhat worse prognosis. Since node involvement means that the cancer is either aggressive or has been there for a while, this is not surprising. It doesn't mean that the cancer can go anywhere. In some cases cancer spreads without ever showing up in the nodes, and in other cases when it is in the nodes, it doesn't spread. The purpose of the nodes is to trap foreign bodies, including cancer cells, not to give them an access route. The specific genetic makeup of the tumor is a more accurate indicator of how likely it is to spread than whether or not it shed some cells that were trapped in the nodes.",

You were diagnosed at a time when AC was the preferred aggressive treatment for breast cancer. By the time I was diagnosed in 2008, some studies were available which led me to refuse to do AC on the grounds that it wasn't very effective on my type of tumor, and furthermore had this possible very serious side effect. Since then, AC is recommended less often, mainly for highly aggressive tumors, but only after a lot of women were exposed to the risk of congestive heart failure unnecessarily.",

Most oncologists prefer to do one treatment at a time, so you would normally start tamox after finishing rads, though some people do them simultaneously. The downside of that is that you double the possibility of side effects. Surgeons do not agree on how big a margin needs to be. As Mandy indicates, a 2mm margin is often considered clear enough, but some surgeons feel more comfortable with bigger margins. If you don't trust your oncologist's judgment, you definitely need to consult another one.",

Your surgeon is right about the port, though. It is less risky to install one in the upper arm, which is where they put mine when they were assuming that I would have to do chemo. The breastcancer sites on the oncotype test need updating, since the test is now available to patients with 1-3 positive nodes. In my case it became a factor in a decision not to do chemo. One of the breastcancer sites also implies that if you seem to need chemo and do it, you will certainly be protected against recurrence, which overstates the benefit. At best, chemo will increase your odds of disease-free survival  for five years by a few percentage points. But with a recurrence score of 33, Grade 3, etc., it would certainly be advisable to do it.",

The NCCN guidelines are merely recommendations which establish a \"standard of practice\" within which oncos can operate safely. No one can sue a doctor for malpractice if s/he stays within those guidelines. That does not keep more daring doctors from experimenting, because NCCN has no enforcement power.

In the case of breast cancer, surgery is mostly essential, so the surgeon doesn't have to sell his or her service. Chemotherapy is often optional, and looking at the posts on this board I see a lot of people with low risk doing chemo anyhow, probably at the urging of an oncologist. Now I'm not saying that this is dishonest. Most people like to feel that their work benefits others, and people with a potentially deadly illness like to believe that some treatment or other will help them survive. In this situation your best defense is knowledge. You need to know exactly what the benefits and risks of your options are, get more than one opinion, and make your own informed decision.

Nevertheless, many people feel more comfortable if they think they have done everything possible to prevent recurrence. I respect their desire for peace of mind. However, it would not give me peace of mind to think that I had exposed myself to unnecessary risk.",

The Oncotype Dx test for node negatives consists of a recurrence score, based on a genomic assessment of your tumor. Low risk is under 18. Intermediate risk 18-30, high risk 30 or above. It also consists of three graphs. One shows the correlation between score and percentage of risk, the other two indicate the relative effectiveness of hormone therapy compared to combined therapy (chemo plus Tam).  These remain about the same if the recurrence score is 15 or less, but after that the incidence with hormone therapy alone starts to rise, while the incidence on combined therapy rises much less. At he end of ten years there is a thirty point difference if your recurrence score is 50.  The graphs give a much clearer picture of where you stand than the numerical score alone. Finally,  the test indicates how positive or negative your ER, PR,and HER2 status is.  I would encourage you and everyone to obtain copies of your medical records, including the Oncotype Dx test results.  They are yours, bought and paid for, and for the most part they are easy to understand and much more informative than anything you can get from a conversation with your oncologist. The oncologist is an expert, but he also has his or her attention divided among a dozen or so patients. You have more time and incentive to look out for yourself than he has, which is why the American Cancer Society encourages patients to be proactive and take a major role in managing their treatment. This may be a headache, but it is also a necessary form of self-preservation. If your oncologist presents you with options and gives you a choice, I would say you have a good oncologist, because this is a rapidly evolving field in which there are few absolutes. If you are interested in the range of regimens that oncologists have to choose from, check out the NCCN website at http://www.nccn.org.  There you will find AC+T, TAC, and the latest arrival, TC, along with many others. You will also find practice guidelines which indicate how differnt types of breast cancer can be treated, when a genomic test becomes a useful part of decision-making, etc. Ferni,  On the issue of ILC, which I have, see http://www.news-medical.net/print_article.asp?id=7087 and http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/17/8/1228 The full text of the latter indicates that \"all . . .chemotherapy was anthrocycline based.\"  I assure you that given my circumstances I have no intention of coming anywhere near an anthrocyline, much less of letting someone infuse it in my veins. TC seems to be the best possibility for lobular, but I don't know of any studies where its efficacy for this particular subtype has been demonstrated. It's a shot in the dark, but probably better than AC, as far as I can determine from the limited informaiton available. I can't see any reason why your Dx score would be high, unless your ILC is pleomorphic. (You might find that out from your pathology report.) I called Genomic Health and asked what the scores were mainly based on, and was told that HER2 status (47%) and hormone receptivity were major factors. If your HER2 is negative and your ER positive, you could reasonably ask them what the high recurrance score was based on. I assume my low score was based on negative HER2 and high ER, but from all diagnostic indications yours should be lower than mine. I didn't have a choice about axillary dissection. My surgeon followed the standard practice of proceding with it if any cancer AT ALL is found in the sentinel nodes. As a result I lost 20 additional nodes which had no cancer in them. This was the worst part of the operation, but the only side effect I have is a little numbness in the underarm area. I repidly regained range of motion in my arm and had no lymphedema, which is probably a much more typical outcome. At least I have some reason to hope that the lymphatic involvement was limited.",

It is a problem that is pervasive in breast cancer treatment, especially in connection with chemotherapy. Just the other day I came across an article titled \"Chemotherapy criticised by Australian oncologists\" in which this same distinction between absolute and relative benefit was emphasized.  According to these Australian oncologists, not only patients but other oncologists are often unclear about this distinction, and if you mistake relative benefit for absolute benefit, you tend to overestimate the value of chemo in preventing relapse and insuring survival. You can find the article by entering the headline in your browser. It is on the cancerfighter.wordpress.com site and dated 8/29/2008. I don't have the entire URL on my printout. My impression is that chemo is a huge industry that thrives on the anxiety of people who have been diagnosed with breast cancer, particularly their fear of recurrence and spread. Drug companies profit from these drugs. Some oncologists administer the drugs themselves and therefore profit directly from them, as well as collecting an infusion fee. A basic 4x course of chemo costs around  $18,000.  More elaborate regimens cost much more. Since patients would rather believe that chemo will increase their chances of survival by 7% ranther than by a negligible 1 or 2%, they are unlikely to question the more attractive prospects suggested by relative benefit figures. This is partly why I suggested to Moody that she look at the St. Luke's study of patient noncompliance with adjuvant therapy. The 61 patients who failed to complete chemo or rads showed \"no significant effect on 5-year local and distant disease-free survival rates.\" However, for the 294 who didn't complete hormone therapy, \" Noncompliance with tamoxifen was associated with decreased 5-year local and distant disease-free survivals (87% versus 96%, 76% versus 87%, respectively.\"  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18809051",

Not everyone (including phlebotomists) are qualified to access ports, and some people who are qualified don't want to be bothered. Ports can be used for blood draws as well as infusions, and they do minimize the damage done to veins by chemo. The arm location has cosmetic advantages, as others have mentioned, but it also rules out taking your blood pressure on the upper arm where the port is located, so there are drawbacks.

Chemo is acceptable if it will help you, but it does not help everyone, and it would not have helped me. If you test as high risk, that's another matter. In that case the Oncotype Dx test can help you accept the necessity of doing chemo.. As my Dx suggests, just having a few positive nodes will not prevent you from being low risk. That's a a theraputic distinction which genomic testing tends to discredit. On the test a crucial distinction exists between 3 or fewer positive nodes and 4 or more, rather than between 0 and 1..",

I'm not doing chemo because my Onco DX score was 16, and because the graph indicated that for node-positive patients that meant zero benefit from chemo. I have the port because I had agreed to do TC before we got the results of Onco DX, which changed the equation considerably. However, I also have deep veins that are hard to locate, so I'm keeping the port for awhile in hopes of avoiding more wear and tear on the small veins in my hand. In standard treatment node positive automatiacally means chemo, but one advantage of the Onco DX test is that it relies on tumor genetics rather than on whether or not some stray cells have made their way to the lymph nodes--which is where they'll probably wind up whether the tumor is aggressive or not. As you can see from my sig, my carciinoma is lobular rather than ductal,;which may be part of the reason for my low Onco 'DX score. Lobular tends to be less aggressive and more resistant to chemo,than ductal, but is usually ER+, so I'm relying on rads and hormonal therapy to finish the.job. Moody--You can add my score to fill a gap.  The recurrence risk is10%.",

And there is nothing wrong scientifically with reasoning back from outcome to causes.or contributing factors, especially if the results have predictive validity. It's done all the time. But it is true that other factors influence treatment decisions, and lymphatic invasion is one of them. Oncotype is not intended to be the sole basis for these decisions, and it wasn't in my case.  It just confirmed what I had already inferred from other evidence. I rejected my first oncologist's proposal of AC, partly because its effectiveness on classic lobular is doubtful, and partlly because of its cardiac toxicity. I'm sure oncologists give what is considiered a safe dose and montor patients closely, but people vary in susceptibiliaty, and no one can guarantee what will happen down the road. TC is effective and does not present a cardiac risk, so I was willing to try it. ",

I don't know what the exact dates of first, second, and third generation regimens are, but that seems rather recent for second generation. Correct me if I'm wrong. And this is the first time I've seen this regimen referred to as DC, though I have seen Taxotere referred to as D in other combinations. The T in AC+T can be either Taxol or Taxotere, depending on the context, since both have been used to follow AC. Here, if D is Taxotere, T is presumably Taxol. A is always Adriamycin, but AC is much more common than CA. I spent a few minutes puzzling over that list of regimens, and admire your ingenuity in sorting it out. Moody--I agree that a 92% chance of no recurrence is impressive, especially if backed up by a healthy mean streak.   As for tamoxifin, like chemo it doesn't necessarily work with lobular, and probably not with some other tumor subtypes, but statistically it does reduce recurrence. The trick is geting on the right side of the statistics. It's too bad that cancer can only be treated by risky methods which do damage themselves. In fact, it sucks. Surely we can do better than this.",

AC + T was a standard regimen for a number of years, and it does work on HER+ patients and some other aggressive tumors, so there was a tendency to think that it was good for everyone. Then, too, In general doctors are  reluctant to stop prescribing something which seems to benefit their patients, and they may tend to dismiss research which calls a method they have used with some success into question. Practice, in other words, naturally tends to lag behind research. I encountered resistance from an oncologist when I rejected his proposal of AC + T and sugtested TC instead.  His response was that  A would only damage a heart that was already weak (not  true), that chemo was generally beneficial (not true), and that the Oncotype Dx test was a diversion for \"women who wanted to know their recurrence score.\" Needless to say, I chose to work with another oncologist. The Oncotype Dx test.is a good way to determine your level of risk, and whehter you would benefit more from chemo or from hormone therapy. The test was originally intended for node-negative patients only, but it now offers note-positive assessment also. It is not,covered by all insurance, but it should be, because in the long run, by determining who actually NEEDS chemo, it should prove cost effective. I'm curious as to how cebula's oncologist knows that her ER+ is only 10%. The Oncotype Dx test describes ER in terms of a numerical scale ranging from 3.7 to 12.5.  My score was 10.9. Any score of 6.5 or above is positive.",

I've found that listening to the recording helps me pick up details that I missed in conversation, or confirms my hazy memory of exactly what was said.. If that node was closest to your tumor, which I'm guessing it was since it was found in breast tissue, then IT was the sentinel node. And the node or nodes closest to the tumor are the likeliest place for shed cells to go--unless there is vascular invasion.What did your path reports say about that? The DX test for node positive cancer tends to suggest that the most crucial distinction is not between no nodes and one node, but between three or less and four or more. With four or more there's a significant jump in rate of recurrence..",

I did rads, and am doing Femara  (so far with NO side effects--this is the easiest part of the treatment to date, and I wouldn't advise skipping it, since your low risk oncotype score assumes tamox or some other hormonal treatment), In your case it sounds as if chemo is doing more harm then good, which is what your Oncotype score would indicate..",

I have noticed that a certain rivalry exists between radiation oncologists and medical oncologists. Each would like to think that his specialty is best. My radiation oncologist is the most talkative of the three specialists, and he told me he thought my decision not to do chemo was correct. He said that for years oncologists have been recommending chemo when they knew that many women with positive nodes didn't need it, and that the science behind the Oncotype test was far more extensive than the science behind any given chemotherapy regimen. In any case, I doubt that your doctors will argue with you.  They are your employees, not your boss. Your med onc may have opted for an aggressive approach to protect himself from a possible malpractice suit (The \"We did everything possible\" defense.), and has stayed safely within NCCN and ASCO guidelines, but what may work for the majority will not work for everyone, and you have good reason to think that it is not working for you. Chemo has a record of working much better for Her2 positives than for Her2 negatives, particularly anthracycline-based chemo. The taxanes seem to work better for negatives, but no guarantee there either, You didn't say whether your tumor was ductal or lobular, but lobular also tends to be less responsive to chemo, which is part of the reason for my doubts about its value for me.",

Renrei--If you're like me, some of what your doctor says in those meetings always gets blurred on recollection. That's why I take a little digital recorder with me, and I'm kicking myself for forgetting to turn it on when I had my first session with the rads onco, but he was so amusing that I forgot about it. I'm not questioning the basic advice your 2nd onc gave you. Onco DX is not enough by itself, and it does apply only to ER+ (so far), though they have recently decided that it can apply to node positve (especially if other evidence points in the same direction). Based on what I've been reading, I'd follow his recommendation about TC. I think it's too early days in chemotherapy research to consider any regimen a gold standard, and AC is not all that effective on HER2-. Good regimens will be replaced by better ones, just as the Onco DX will improve or be replaced by a better test as we learn more about BC. Snowbird--I think TC is worth a try. It seems to be effective on some ILC, and definitely on HER2-, and it is generally well tolerated. Moody--I know that you like to get things over with, and hormonal takes patience, but I think it may be worth the effort.",

I couldn't agree more with everything you say. I had people congratulate me for taking an active role in deciding on my own treatment, and I also had people express concern about my refusal to follow my first oncologist's advice. Some people assume that established practice is necessarily best for everyone, but in a rapidly developing field like chemotherapy there are few absolutes. Even health professionals have trouble keeping  up with developments in the field. The only solution is to be your own advocate and get as informed as possible about BC diagnosis and treatment. This is not an ideal situation, but it's better than being pushed into inappropriate, unnecessary, and risky treatments.

In fact it attacks ALL rapidly dividing cells, which is why your blood counts go down and you lose your hair--those cells divide rapidly also, and the chemo doesn't know a hair-growing cell from a cancer cell. The oncotype test is a more detailed assessment of the nature of a tumor than the observations the lab technician includes in your path report. While no test is infallible, the oncotype test is highly reliable. And there is also quite a bit of research indicating that chemo is relativley ineffective on \"indolent\" (slow growing) tumors, and it does involve some substantial risks. If you forego chemo now and have ithe cancer come back, you will of course use it later. But if you use it now and have a recurrence, you can't use the same regimen again because it would be too toxic. All treatments of cancer have their drawbacks, so it's a matter of trying to identify the treatment plan that will work best for you and do the least harm. You're doing the right thing by asking guestions, and the answers should help you make the best decision you can make.",

Chemo tends to be most effective on more aggressive tumors, and since yours is Stage III and grade 3, it would seem an appropriate treatment for you. NAZsusan's situation is quite differentt. It is debatable that she is node positive, and even if she were node positive, chemo would not necessarily be beneficial.",
