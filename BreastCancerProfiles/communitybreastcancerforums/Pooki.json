They said everything looked good, but they can't take the drain out because my output is too high. I have been consistently outputting 78-112 ccs of liquid in a 24 hour period now for a full week. Is that normal? When I left the hospital, I had significantly more liquid, but it was going down a little every day. Now I have just stopped here. I have a four hour flight on Saturday and had hoped that the drain could be removed tomorrow, but it isn't looking like that will happen. I also received my final pathology report on Monday, and after they explained everything to me, when I got home I started looking through the report more carefully and discovered that the results didn't list any info about ER/PR/HER profile at all. They had a note referring to my first biopsy results that listed me as ER+/PR+/HER2-. They also did a Mammaprint on the biopsy sample, which I thought they needed to use a piece of the tumor for accurate results. It seems like they are just relying on the biopsy results for the hormone profile, which I am freaked out about because it's kind of key when determining my treatment. When I called and asked for clarification on this, they just kept referring me to the biopsy results as my final pathology for my hormone profile. This just doesn't seem right to me. This is all so confusing and I feel like I have to chase down answers, after waiting 2 months to get to what I thought would be the final results. Has anyone else had this happen with their final pathology? Dx 8/9/2018, IDC, Right, 2cm, Stage IB, Grade 2, 2/20 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- (IHC) Log in to post a reply",

We thought it might be from the breast biopsy since I had two decent sized hematomas from that procedure, but the MRI results led my surgical oncologist to order an ultrasound and biopsy of my right axilla.

That is so awesome! :) Yes, this whole process has been very grueling - more than I thought it would be. I've always been super calm and collected and approached things logically, but this has really tested me! Even with getting some answers now, final pathology is still going to be king because they don't have all the answers yet. I'm glad you were able to dodge chemo. I'm sure that was quite a relief! Chemo is going to be an option for me, since they believe I have three lymph nodes that have the cancer. But both the breast surgeon and medical oncologist told me yesterday, that it is best for me to do chemo before surgery, since they would have to remove all the lymph nodes in my axilla if I did surgery first. So far I am considered to be Stage IIA. Up next will be a CT Scan, Bone Scan, EKG and Ultrasound of my Heart. And I know I will be on this board A LOT while waiting for the results!",

They did a breast needle core biopsy, which came back positive for IDC, ER+/PR+, HER2-. Doctor ordered an MRI and three swollen lymph nodes were found in my right axilla. Went and did a needle core biopsy on one of the swollen lymph nodes last week, and the results came back as follows: Review of the H&E section shows a core needle biopsy segment of blood clot, skeletal muscle, and fibrous tissue, the latter showing involvement by invasive ductal carcinoma. ER+/PR+, HER2- Right axilla, core biopsy: IDC, Intermediate grade, involving soft tissue. Comment: No lymph node tissue is present. My surgical oncologist is concerned about the \"involvement of soft tissue\" and there being \"no lymph node tissue present\" and has stopped talking about me getting a lumpectomy and wants to send me to a medical oncologist to start chemotherapy first. Has anyone else had an lymph node biopsy with results like this? When I first met w/ the doctor, she said that this was an early stage cancer, totally curable, and now she said best case scenario I am Stage IIA, worst case, Stage IV. I can't believe this.... She also ordered testing to see if I carried any breast cancer genes (Mom was diagnosed at 48) and that came back negative. I am just a mess....I know not having answers in the beginning is normal, and part of the process...It's just been really hard emotionally.
