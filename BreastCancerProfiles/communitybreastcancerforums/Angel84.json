My mother started with chemo on 21st December and now 10th of January they've found she has a lot of bacteries in urine, probably urinary tract infection. Did anyone had something similar? My concern is that they will postpone her chemotherapy (FAC) and it was scheduled on 28 cycle period and also, she heard that some1 said that chemo doesn;t have effect when you have this type of infection? Can some1 who has more info tell me more?",

I would appreciate if you could tell me if you know what are the consequences of prolonged time between chemo cycles. My mother had first chemo 27 days ago, she is scheduled in 2 days, but her ESR (sedimentation rate) is high, and she had frequent urination, tested negative for UTC so it's maybe cystitis or smth else. Do you know if that will prolong chemo for sure if leukocytes are normal and what if chemo is given in 28+ days after first? Will it have any affect or she would need to start again with cycles? She also has a little bit higher creatinine...if normal is up to 96, she has 102...Did you have similar thing? Thank you!",

My mother was supposed to get her 4th chemotherapy tomorrow on her 25th day, her blood work was excellent but, she found little blood in urine so she did the test and found that she has UTI. she won't know which one until tomorrow. She's being very upset, crying all day, since she thinks that it will delay her therapy for at least 7 days. Do you know if there is a possibility that she receives chemo with UTI, and if they delay her chemo past 28 days, will any of this have effect or she would have to begin new cycles?",
