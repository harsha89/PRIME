I am a senior at Paul Smith's college and this is to complete my senior thesis for graduation. I am doing a simply study on the diets of chemotherapy patients. My end result is to hopefully create a sort of meal plan based on the likes and dislikes of patiens, as well as their nutritional need. This thesis was inspired by my dear aunt who is currently undergoing chemotherapy (and has been for three years now) for colon cancer, as well as my godfather who sadly passed away due to stomach cancer. if anyone is able and willing to fill out this survey I would greatly appriciate it, it will only take a few minutes! If not I completely understand and appriciate your time. Thank you all. Below is the link for the survey. Again, thank you for your time! www.surveymonkey.com/s/RLZMW9W Log in to post a reply",
