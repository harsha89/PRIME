    "Content": "Oxnardpackers wrote: Hi there, I just got my PET Scan results today.  They were okay but there were a couple of items that the report addressed.  They found new small lymph nodes in my neck in the supraclavicular region the largest of which is 9mm.  My oncologist felt my neck and did not feel any swollen lymph nodes.  She said we will watch this but I should not worry about this because it could be a result of a virus.  Of course I am concern and nervous about this.  Has anybody had similar results like this before and they are okay.  How accurate are these scans and have people had results where it look suspicious and it was nothing. Also will this roller coaster ride ever get better? Thanks for all your help. Dx 1/28/2010, DCIS, 3cm, Stage IIA, Grade 2, 0/0 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
