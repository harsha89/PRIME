Some are distinct tumors of approx 1 cm diameter, but some of it is diffuse. She had an MRI and biopsy before starting treatment with xeloda. After 3 cycles of xeloda, the tumor markers are down to less than half of what they started at, liver enzymes are at normal range and the MRI shows the cancer is shrinking. But, at the end of the first cycle she developed ascites (no cancer cells in the fluid) due to portal hypertension. This has gotten progressively worse, as the cancer gets \"better\". Her Oncologist has not seen this before. This seems the opposite of what should be happening. The radiologist who interprets the MRI says there is narrowing of small hepatic veins, scar tissue developing. It's rare, but there are reported cases of sinusoidal obstructive syndrome with chemo, but with xeloda its even rarer. Our Onc seems puzzled, and that scares me, as he may make a wrong treatment decision. My wife is currently taking 2 weeks off xeloda to see if this partially resolves. What to do? If she continues the chemo and this venal occlusion / sos / portal hypertension gets worse, not only is it debilitating, but it could be lethal in and of itself. We are trying to find a more experienced cancer center to assist. We might try John Hopkins, Memorial Sloan Kettering and MD Anderson, if they are willing to assist in a second opinion. Any suggestions on how to go about doing this?

While the Doc's can't be certain of the exact cause, her extensive liver metastasis certainly played a major role in it. It seemed like the treatment with xeloda brought it on. It got to the point where she was getting draining of 5 liters of fluid in less than a week. She was so swollen she had trouble eating and breathing. All she could so is sit, and sit uncomfortably. She got a drain installed so we could drain it at home. They put her on diuretics and a heparin based blood thinner (subcutaneious daily injections). Eventually the ascites went away. We thank God for that miracle of healing. She stopped the diuretics, its still stayed away. It's been 10 months now and it hasn't come back. The Doc's don't think the blood thinner played any role in reducing it, as they say it can't dissolve clots, but it may prevent or slow it coming back. Her precancer diagnostic mri showed partial blockage of a hepatic vein. It's still partially blocked. The way I understand it, the liver filters return blood flow from the small intestines. If the blood vessels in the liver become blocked, they call that Bud Chiari syndrome. That blockage causes increased pressure, because the blood can't flow. The increased pressure causes blood to become backed up, it causes ascites, esophageal varices (varicose veins in the throat) and a swollen spleen. When the pressure goes back down, even to a small degree, you can get a large reduction in the ascites. The diuretics treat the symptoms to some degrees, as do drainages. Neither are a treatment of the cause.",

As for the curcumin, its more the worry that it might interfere with drug metabolism, than fear the curcumin itself would be harmful to ER+ patients. A knowledgeable researcher (I mentioned above) in the breast cancer field in fact recommends curcumin and says that its propensity to interfere with aromatase inhibitors is purely theoretical, and not actual. I am sure that if he thought the curcumin itself would be harmful to ER+ patients he would not recommend it. If anyone has found anything suggesting otherwise, I would like to hear about it.",

That is really recent and relevant information, especially considering it considers human patients and their (tamoxifen) drug metabolism as affected by curcumin. Really gives one pause for consideration to taking curcumin along with any drug that relies on cyp3A, cyp2c9 or perhaps cyp2d6 (as is used for tamoxifen metabolism). Hopefully the fenbendazole doesn't actually need curcumin to work on cancer. I can't access the published article, but found some commentary on it at a site called Beyond Conventional Cancer Therapies. The reduction in endoxifen levels was mild, 8 and 12 percent for curcumin and curcumin plus piperine. https://bcct.ngo/search-therapies/search-therapy-summaries/curcumin : Curcumin is generally regarded as safe by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Epidemiological evidence and several clinical trials confirm the safety of curcumin up to 12 grams per day over several months.51 However, compounds in curcumin can bind to iron and reduce iron's availability, a concern to people with anemia or iron-storage problems. Iron levels may need to be monitored with curcumin supplement use.52 Preliminary clinical evidence shows that cucrumin may slightly reduce the effectiveness of tamoxifen. In a study of breast cancer patients, researchers in the Netherlands gave tamoxifen with or without curcumin 1200 mg three times a day. The group taking tamoxifen in combination with curcumin had about an 8 percent decrease in endoxifen levels. If the curcumin was compounded with piperine (often done to substantially improve curcumin absorption), endoxifen levels were further decreased by 12 percent.53 Read more about this study and implications for use during tamoxifen treatment in the Commentary section below. Dr. Lise Alschuler cautions that curcumin should not be taken with some drugs (cyclophosphaide, anastrozole, exemestane, letrozole or erlotinib, or therapeutic doses of warfarin),54 and the TRC Natural Medicines database lists several interactions with chemotherapy drugs, diabetes medications and other drugs that lower blood sugar, estrogens, drugs that slow blood clotting, and other drugs. Medical supervision is recommended at doses higher than those typically found in foods. Dr. Weil and Alina Health provide these cautions:55 ",

My tolerance for risk is lower, when the chance of benefit is lower. As well, if a treatment is working, I am loath to risk interfering with it. There is a very smart guy, a researcher and writer named Constantine Kaniklidis, who wrote that curcumin's ability to interfere with letrozole, was purely hypothetical, and in practice it would not interfere with it. If that's true, then it may also hold true for ibrance. But, as I said, I have a low tolerance for risk where the reward is not great. My wife used to take curcumin, but only during her time off cancer drugs. As well, the form of curcumin she was taking, theracumin, has much greater absorption into the blood stream, and might interfere more strongly than any other form of curcumin. Goldie, that looks like an excellent vitamin E supplement. Maybe everyone should eat some walnuts as well, as they are a source of vitamin E, and as mentioned by someone about a month ago, some research showed eating a couple of ounces of walnuts a day downregulated genetic markers in breast cancer tumors in women.",

My wife and I have given up on that. Fear of liability on the part of Doctors for the consequences of any unapproved treatment alone would have them tell you not to do it. Yes, you are working without a net, so to speak, but if anything goes wrong I feel most oncologists will blame it on the alternative or complementary treatment. As well, they may hold it against you, and if you want to go into any clinical trial, I fear they may reject you on that basis. You will be perceived by your Oncologist as untrustworthy, unreliable and a danger to your self. We have medical people in our family and I have given up on talking to them about these issues. They base opinions on the most uninformed assumptions, old nonsense they were told in school and make snap opinions to condemn ideas. As far as I am concerned, I do my absolute best to ascertain known drug interactions, potential drug interactions, toxicity, estrogenicity, cytochrome enzyme inhibitions and base the decision on risk + cost vs likelihood of reward.",

It is quite likely (based on research of impact of the various forms) that the protective action of vitamin E, and its anti-cancer abilities, stem from other isomers (forms) than alpha tocopherol. In fact, taking alpha tocopherol alone may be bad, as it throws off the balance of these 8 isomers. Look for a natural source that include tocotrienols.",

      "Content": "Oct 14, 2017 09:57PM - edited Oct 14, 2017 10:06PM by Husband11 Bluebird, here's my thoughts on doing both xeloda and ibrance at the same time. The conventional wisdom assumes a monoculture of the cancer. IE, that all cells are identical and thus one treatment at a time. Xeloda is an anti mitotic. It works by interfering with the normal processes that produce cell division, in some respects by substituting a faulty building block, and killing the rapidly dividing cell. If one assumes the anti hormonal treatment (plus ibrance) halts or slows the targeted cancer cell's division process, the xeloda should be ineffective and needless. But that assumes all the cells respond to the anti hormonal and cease to divide (or cease to divide rapidly). If only some of the cells are put into dormancy by the antihormonal and ibrance, but other cells continue to divide rapidly, I can't see why the xeloda wouldn't fight the war on two different fronts, with two distinctly different enemies. But, I'm no Doctor. It's certainly not worth doing if one of the treatments alone is working, but that isn't the case here. Nor would it be wise to subject a patient to potentially double the side effects, without benefit. But in your case..., it might be worth it. Especially if you can manage the side effects. Here's an article discussing combining hormonal therapy with chemo plus anti her2 drugs, where the patient is both hormone receptor positive and her2 positive. They concluded that it was beneficial. It's not exactly the same, but its similar to what you are proposing. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC38603...  Here's an old article from 1985 (maybe out of date, but still raises important questions) that summarizes my thoughts on why they typically are not combined: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0... Both chemotherapeutic agents and hormones are effective in breast cancer treatment. Their mechanism of action seems to be conflicting: while cytotoxic drugs are active on cycling cells, hormones prolong the G0 phase. Therefore, the concurrent use of hormones and chemotherapy could decrease their expected clinical activity. On the contrary, a review of the literature suggests that there could be some synergistic action with combined therapy. The problem is therefore to assess the efficacy of simultaneous vs sequential administration of hormones and chemotherapy. In advanced disease the general conclusion could be that simultaneous administration of combined therapy: (1) increases, although the difference is not statistically significant, the response rate both in pre and postmenopausal patients; and (2) the most important end point, total survival, is not statistically improved by simultaneous vs sequential administration. In addition, in the adjuvant setting combined treatment appears superior to chemotherapy only in postmenopausal, receptor-positive patients. No definite conclusion is today available in premenopause.

      "Content": "Jun 22, 2016 09:52AM - edited Jun 22, 2016 09:53AM by Husband11 I posted a \"rant\" on facebook, telling of the bumbling and stumbling system that lead up to my wife's first, late, diagnosis, and the present treatment dilemma she faces of what appears to be sinusoidal obstructive syndrome in her liver, that only showed up after starting chemo, worsened with each of the 3 cycles, and now the Onc simply wishes to proceed with a fourth cycle. I am worried the treatment will kill her before the disease. They seem to have conveniently forgotten the order in which this occurred, an outwardly appearing healthy woman starts chemo and despite the cancer getting \"better\", confirmed by both MRI and tumor markers, her liver is becoming more and more damaged. The nurse blamed it on my wife taking an extra week off, despite it having been given the Onc's blessing (as relayed through HER), and not even occurred yet. Frightening ignorance. And she is our interface with the Oncologist. An old friend who is a Doctor saw the post, and has intervened. He has pulled some strings to get my wife's case brought up tomorrow during the case files discussion, with hope that input from other oncologists will lead to more careful consideration of the problem. We prayed, and I believe our prayers are being answered. As well, tomorrow my wife goes for having a permanent tap installed to allow more frequent draining of her ascites.",

Assuming the drain is any good, that's a record low amount for 6 days accumulation. We made a chart of her drainage history, divided by days between drainage, and it definately goes up and down. It's highest accumulation per day, 0.8 litres/day just after her xeloda cycle has ended. It goes down to as low as 0.27 per day at the early days of the beginning of her next cycle. That seems to correlate with time off xeloda. She is just finishing up 2 weeks off xeloda, and her accumuation is down to 0.17 per day, but she also just started on diuretics, so that has to be factored in. In any event, time off does bring relief. Let's hope it is fully reversable at some point in the near future.",

The Doctor thinks its entirely due to the diuretics, but I am optimistic that a fluid accumulation that has gone down from 5 liters to 100ml (50x change) is due to more than just the diuretics. The Doctor has as of yesterday, put Bev on blood thinners, a daily injection, to try to improve blood flow through her liver. And, he is talking about having a shunt installed. I'm skeptical that is needed. From what I read, a TIPS procedure should be a last resort, when nothing else works. It seems to me the problem is either nearly fully resolved, or treated with the diuretics. I hope they think this through fully before proceeding. I think he is acting based on her status a month ago, and not right now. As someone advised, trust your intuition. And our intuition is questioning this.",

But, that test isn't accurate at all, as my wife had ascites and they did that procedure over and over again and claimed it was gas. They even did an x ray and said it was constipation and gas. Ultimately, by using an ultrasound device they were instantly able to say it was fluid. If it's fluid, it will be accompanied by weight gain. Now that may be really hard to distinguish as you previously fasted. My wife ended up going to an emergency room, they used an ultrasound wand, and saw the layer of fluid. So, I would say that is the best way to diagnose its cause.",

Hard to imagine that when she dies of say a heart attack, her death is going to be entered on some registry of former breast cancer patients and be counted as a survivor.  I wonder where they get their data from?  To me, all these stats are very rough measures, unless you are talking about a particular study that followed x number of women for x number of years for death or recurrance.  The good news is that the studies of those sorts I've seen of stage 2/3, present quite favorable data compared to the 22% we just roughly calculated for overall death vs reported diagnosis.",

If the cancer is hormone receptor positive, then consider endocrine based therapies such as aromatase inhibitors, selective estrogen receptor modulators or downgraders, ibrance and other cdk 4/6 inhibitors. Also, some oral chemo's such as xeloda carry less side effects than IV chemos. If your life is not immediately at threat, then you can decide if it is worth the risk of trying less disruptive therapies first. One of the ladies on here, Bestbird, put together a very comprehensive stage IV treatment guide. It covers most if not all the main stream options. It is worth reviewing. I believe you need to email her to request a copy. See this post for the details: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/8/topics/... ",

They give approximate dimensions for it and call it enlarged. Increased size equals more hoarding of platelets, is all that I know of. If your spleen isn't enlarged, then I would say its purely a platelet production issue. I believe platelets are formed in the bone marrow. My wife tried papaya leaf extract, as it has helped people with low platelets in certain circumstances, but it did nothing for her. No point her continuing to take it if it did no good, and I fear that it has potential to interfere with drugs that are working.",

Her liver mets were multiple and diffuse. It caused both a near total blockage of one of the hepatic arteries, and probably some increased internal resistance to blood flow. That resulted in hepatic hypertension, which both caused ascites and damage and distention of various veins, such as umbilical, tracheal, and permanently enlarged her spleen. They put her on a combination of two oral diuretics, which were supposed to counter out each other's side effects, and also on an injection blood thinner. The blood thinner we suspect caused significant thinning of her hair, which recovered after she quit the blood thinner. She also had a line installed so we could drain the ascites at home. At her worst, we were draining nearly a gallon of fluid out in a week. Eventually the xeloda she was on shrank her tumors and the ascites ended. Took many months. Her spleen remains enlarged, and she once had a significant bleed from an esophageal blood vessel that broke. So, in summary, the things that she did were: 1) Blood thinner (if you go on a blood thinner, consider researching one that doesn't cause hair loss, such as fondaparinux.); 2) Diuretics; 3) Line to drain ascites at home; 4) success through successful response to the chemo drug.",

While it was at its worst, they put her on blood thinners and diuretics. Not sure if that helped, but eventually as the ascites went away, she quit both, and it continued to resolve itself. The idea behind the blood thinners was based on the speculation that the cause of her obstruction through her liver was blood clots. That, however is speculative. It was more a suggestion as a preventative measure from it getting worse, than actually treating it, as they don't believe the drug can break up clots. The ascites is often caused by / accompanied with portal hypertension, which means the liver is clogged up for blood flowing through. Precise cause, unknown, although clearly related to the cancer. Some cancers do increase blood clotting factors. The heart pushes blood through your small intestine and then from there it drains through your liver. If the flow through the liver is impaired, the blood and fluid accumulate, shed fluid, and distend the blood vessels and connected organs such as spleen, umbilical and esophagus veins. My wife had her esophagus scoped because the veins can become varicose and bleed. So watch for tarry stools. If the ascites needs draining more often than you wish to visit the hospital, you can have a port installed and drain it at home. The port can be removed when the ascites resolves. If the ascites gets really severe, get an ultrasound to look at the veins and blood flow. If they are very varicose, consider booking a scoping of your esophagus to look for varices that might bleed, and can be banded, as a preventative treatment.",

An interesting thing in the animal kingdom is that animals with extremely powerful immune systems, like rats, are extremely prone to cancer.  Inert substances that would not cause cancer in humans, cause cancer in rats.  Rats have such a strong immune system that you can perform surgery on them without having any regard to sterile technique.  They can easily fight off ordinary bacteria, even when its introduced into their deep tissue.  Yet if you insert a piece of inert plastic into its body during surgery, the rat's immune system forms a tumor like structure around it, and attempts to isolate it from the body.  It can eventually form a cancerous tumor.  On the subject of autoimmune disease,  the immune system is very specific to the agents it deems foreign.  The problem with autoimmune diseases is more along the lines of why the body sees its own tissue, very specific tissue,as foreign.  I don't think there's any evidence that people with autoimmune disease fight off infections more strongly than the average person.  Its just that their system is for some reason targeting its own tissue.  There is a stage in embryonic development where the fetus has no immune system.  The immune system develops in a manner that it accepts whatever is present at that time as neutral and non-invasive.  Thereafter, new, foreign invading substances that were not present at that time are attacked by the immune system.  Antigens develop against those foreign invaders.  The problem with cancer is that for the most part, it slips \"under the radar\" of our immune system, healthy or otherwise because it is our own tissue, or at least not foreign enough to stimulate a strong response against it.",

The diffuse nature of the metastasis in her liver gives her liver a permanently cirrhosis like appearance, and while the MRI's have confirmed some shrinkage, the imaging isn't likely to change for the better, even though the cancer is knocked back. Her tumor markers went from 300-400 prior to treatment, down to 20-40 range on xeloda, and are now down to 10 and 17 on ibrance / letrozole. For her, the tumor markers may be more accurate than the imaging, unless the imaging shows growth, as the imaging will always shows a swiss cheese like liver that they say image wise, doesn't even look like cancer, it looks like cirrhosis. So, be hopefull. This combination can work well on liver mets.",

Lately I've been reading about broccoli extracts and their potential for benefit to cancer patients. There is a clinical trial on right now where they have been able to reverse HR positive resistance to anti hormonal therapy by using sulforadex, a patented delivery system for sulforaphane, a compound found in broccoli. A phase 2b trial in underway, and results are expected to be reported in mid 2018.",

They point out that they see some fluid. Nothing like she had before though. She had a drain installed, and one time we drained 4-5 liters in less than a week. It took some time, but eventually it stopped, and they removed the drain. If they are going to drain it using a needle, they use ultrasound to find the exact spot to put it into the pocket of fluid. They were good in explaining it to us while it was being done. They compare sides, see which pocket of fluid is the deepest, and go into only one side. They say its too risky to do both sides for some reason.",

That's fairly low for two days (approx 0.2L/day). I will keep track of the volume to see if it rises again as she gets into another xeloda cycle. She is starting xeloda again today. Doc says she can do two weeks on and then two weeks off. That's rather unorthodox, but as long as it works thats all that matters. Unfortunately at the Oncology rounds on Thursday where he brought up Bev's case, the ascites that came on only after starting chemo, no one had any new suggestions. We were rather disappointed.

It's been going down fairly steadily now for over a month. I am in disbelief that the diuretics alone could account for such a drastic change, 5L going down to virtually nothing.

One can only guess as to the reason the drug brought it on, but there was rapid kill off of cancer cells. She had a lot of cancer throughout her liver. Some in discrete tumors, some scattered like buckshot. It may have been an immune reaction to the dying cells. It posed a significant risk to her health. At first they thought it was gas, but it was fluid accumulation in her belly. The xrays they did, were useless and lead them to believe she was constipated. The tapping on her belly, led them astray as well. That fluid is a symptom of hepatic hypertension caused by blockage. Another symptom, and life threatening, is the hypertension causes blood vessels in the area and espophagus to stretch and swell. There is risk of internal bleeding. They put her on blood thinners and a diuretic. Eventually she got a drainage port installed, but by then, the fluid accumulation had slowed. Now it has stopped. Xeloda has worked exceptionally well on her liver mets, but she went through a real tough spell after starting treatment. The treatment posed more risk than the disease, in the short term. They can watch liver function through enzyme levels, but those didn't rise alarmingly. Her bilirubin numbers did however reflect problems with the liver draining, in her case. It might be different for others. She also experienced steady weight gain as fluid accumulated.",

I am only bringing this up because it seems you have an open mind towards complementary and alternative medicine. Have you read anything about maitake D extract? It's a medicinal mushroom extract that is proven to enhance the immune system. Best of all, it can be taken along with conventional treatment and doesn't appear to interfere with it. There is a lot of research showing it impacts cancer cells in the test tube and in mice. There is solid research showing it enhances the immune system of human breast cancer patients. There are japanese patient studies that show it helped many cancer patients, from improving quality of life to even some cases of it apparently working against cancer. I've studied it for many years, and there are few contraindications, and the optimal dosage for enhancing the immune system has been scientifically shown in a North American clinical trial to be 6 mg/kg body weight daily. My wife has been on it for years, and it really boosted her neutrophil count before she restarted chemo, so I know it does something positive for her (in that respect at least). Perhaps you might want to read up about it. Not knocking cbd oil, but maitake has a lot more research behind it. And its probably less costly than cbd oil. Here's an article showing it works against breast cancer in mice: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC50551... Here's a post I made about it with many other articles: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/79/topics... Here's a good recent article from 2017: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27892708 D-Fraction is protein-bound β-1,6 and β-1,3 glucans (proteoglucan) extracted from the edible and medicinal mushroom Grifola frondosa (Maitake). The antitumoral effect of D-Fractions increasing evidence showed that D-Fraction directly affects the viability of canine and human tumor cells, independent of the immune system. Previously, we have reported that D-Fraction modulates the expression of genes associated with cell proliferation, cell death, migration, invasion, and metastasis in MCF7 human breast cancer cells. Therefore, the purpose of the current study is to investigate if this modulation of gene expression by Maitake D-Fraction really modulates tumor progression. In the present work, we demonstrate for the first time that Maitake D-Fraction is able to act directly on mammary tumor cells, modulating different cellular processes involved in the development and progression of cancer. We demonstrate that D-Fraction decreases cell viability, increases cell adhesion, and reduces the migration and invasion of mammary tumor cells, generating a less aggressive cell behavior. In concordance with these results, we also demonstrate that D-Fraction decreases tumor burden and the number of lung metastases in a murine model of breast cancer.",

She buys Mushroom wisdom 4x extract. With the 4x, its 3.7 mg/drop. They make a standard version as well, but then you have to take 4 times as much. Optimal dosage for boosting the immune system is 5-6 mg/kg of body weight daily, split into two doses. So, if you weigh 55kg, you need 37 drops, twice a day to get 5 mg/kg of body weight. If you can't afford to consume it at that rate, then just follow the instructions on the bottle for a lower dosage. Response is dose dependent, but studies show that if you take too much, it has a negative effect compared to the lower dosage, and may even cause suppression at really high dosages (like 10mg/kg body weight). Don't combine the 6 mg/kg with any other mushroom therapy, as that would exceed the optimal dosage. A Japanese clinical study was done with most patients receiving 125 mg extract per day, plus 4 grams of whole mushroom. Some people got amazing results, but that kind of evidence is anecdotal, and therefor not 100% reliable. Interestingly, breast cancer patients got the best results. They graded benefit based on a number of factors, not just cancer regression, so that inflates the figures somewhat. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12126464 That's an abstract. I have read the whole paper, and it gives the doses and regimes the patients went on. Typical was 125 mg per day (so, less than half the scientifically tested \"optimal dosage\" ) plus some whole mushroom power. Whole maitake is cheap. I buy it dried, grind it in a blend tec blender and put a heaping tablespoon in a cup of water and slow boil it in the microwave, to maximize extraction. ",

Zhang Y1, Sun D2, Meng Q3, Guo W1, Chen Q1, Zhang Y1. Grifola frondosa, a type of food and medical fungus, has been shown to exhibit various pharmacological activities, including anticancer effects. As the most typical cancer diagnosed among female patients, breast cancer remains a huge concern threatening human health globally. In the present study, the anti-breast cancer effects of Grifola frondosa polysaccharides (GFPs) and the underlying mechanisms were investigated in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, as well as in nude mice bearing MCF-7 tumor xenografts. GFPs exerted cytotoxic effects on the cells, as indicated by a decrease in cell viability, and an increase in the apoptototic rate, lactate dehydrogenase release and reactive oxygen species accumulation, inducing mitochondrial dysfunction. The increased expression of Bax, cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-8, and the reduced levels of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-extra large (Bcl\u2011xL) were observed in the cells incubated with GFPs and in the tumor tissues of the mice treated with GFPs. Moreover, the GFPs significantly suppressed the phosphorylation of AKT/glycogen synthase kinase-3β and extracellular signal-regulated kinases in a time-dependent manner. Finally, the inhibition of MCF-7 tumor xenograft growth further confirmed the anti-breast cancer effects of GFPs. All these findings revealed that GFPs induced human breast cancer cell apoptosis via the mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic pathway, and provide experimental evidence to support the use of Grifola frondosa as a potential treatment for breast cancer.",

I think they prefer primovist here for liver mets. I asked about PET scans for her liver, and the Oncologist said it wasn't as good in her opinion as an MRI. My wife gets the occasional CT scan, but that's for lungs and other organs. The MRI of her liver covers the liver, some blood vessels such as umbilical and esophageal, and also shows her spleen. It also shows some ascites. Following her cancer recession from Xeloda, several new small unknowns showed up on the MRI, they would be either new cancer growth, or nodules of regrowth of the liver tissue regenerating. Months later upon repeating the MRI, it was no longer there, so they don't believe it was cancer, that it was in fact regrowth of liver tissue. At this time, her MRI's show an image that is just like before, more of a psuedo scerosis, than classical cancer. In fact the radiologist called her oncologist to ask if a biopsy had ever been done, because it didn't look like cancer to him. In fact, it never really did look like cancer, more like wide spread cerosis. But, we know from the biopsy that it is cancer. So that's my experience with MRI's.",

Asparaginase which blocks its internal production has been used for treatment of lymphomas since the 1970's and is also used as a veterinary medicine for the same purpose. Seems more likely something like asparginase will play a role in treatment, if the research is applicable to humans. Hard to imagine what they fed those poor mice to deprive them of asparagine, and what the health consequences would be for a human. Nevertheless, they are putting together a phase 2 clinical trial to test the hypothesis that a diet low in asparagine will lower the levels in the human body. Got to be a pretty crappy diet if it excludes milk, eggs, meat, fish, soy, grains and starches.",

It gives it a pseudo cerrosis look, in other words it looks like cerrosis, not cancer, even though biopsy proves its cancer. So, xeloda can work rather rapidly. Not sure its as rapid as say abraxane, but still rapidly. Personally, I have this uneducated view that you don't want it to work too rapidly in the liver, as dieing cancer cells have to be reabsorbed by the body, and in my wife's case lead to a temporary state of blockage and subsequent ascites. It might have been better if she took a lower dose and spread the healing out over time, but then again I am no Doctor.",

It seems like the response to treatment is triggering the congestion of her liver. It is only getting worse, as the cancer gets smaller. She might take up the onc's offer to take two weeks off xeloda and see what happens. There seems to be a slight trend between her cycles of xeloda and the rate of fluid accumulation. I fear that the xeloda, or some interaction between the cancer (dieing off) and xeloda is producing this venal occlusive disorder. They are puzzing over her latest MRI, and talking about narrowing of small veins, blood clots, scarring, pretty much everything and the kitchen sink, which makes me wonder if they really can pinpoint what is happening or if they are just guessing.

TAKE-HOME MESSAGE After a 36-month follow-up period, early initiation of ZOL provided significant benefits in bone health and improved DFS in postmenopausal women receiving adjuvant AI therapy for early hormone-receptor positive breast cancer. SUMMARY OncologySTAT Editorial Team Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) have greater efficacy than tamoxifen as adjuvant endocrine therapy for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer. Bisphosphonates such as zoledronic acid (ZOL) have been demonstrated to prevent bone loss and reduce the risk of fracture associated with AIs, and have also been demonstrated to improve cancer outcomes. Eidtmann et al reported the results of a 36-month follow-up of the Zometa-Femara Adjuvant Synergy Trial (ZO-Fast). Patients for whom ZOL treatment was initiated immediately after randomization (immediate ZOL group) experienced improved bone health and disease-free survival (DFS) compared with those for whom ZOL treatment was delayed (delayed ZOL group). In this open-label multicenter randomized trial, patients were postmenopausal women or women who were recently menopausal because of chemotherapy or ovarian suppression for hormone-receptor positive early breast cancer. Baseline lumbar spine (LS) and total hip bone mineral density (BMD) T-scores were required to be > -2.0. Patients were randomly assigned to receive immediate or delayed ZOL treatment. All patients received oral daily letrozole for 5 years and daily calcium and vitamin D supplements. In the immediate ZOL group, ZOL was provided beginning immediately after randomization. In the delayed ZOL group, ZOL was provided if the patient's T-score became < -2.0 after a nontraumatic bone fracture or if an asymptomatic fracture was detected by spinal x-ray. A total of 1065 patients were randomly assigned in the original ZO-Fast trial. Baseline and 36-month BMD data were available for 314 patients in the immediate ZOL group and 319 in the delayed ZOL group. From baseline to 36 months, LS BMD increased by 4.39% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.69%-5.11%) in the immediate ZOL group, and decreased by 4.9% (95% CI, -5.54% to -4.25%) in the delayed ZOL group (least squares mean difference between groups, 92.9%; 95% CI, 8.37%-10.20%; P < .0001). Slightly smaller but still significant changes were observed for total hip BMD (P < .0001). More patients in the immediate ZOL group than in the delayed ZOL group with baseline lumbar T-scores between -2.0 and -1.0 transitioned to normal BMD (P < .001), and more patients in the delayed ZOL group than in the immediate ZOL group developed severe osteopenia/osteoporosis (P < .001). However, similar proportions of patients in the immediate and delayed ZOL groups experienced fractures (5.0% vs 6.0%; P = .502). A total of 506 of 532 immediate ZOL patients and 489 of532 delayed ZOL patients were disease free and alive, corresponding to an absolute difference of 3.2% between the two groups and a relative reduction of 41% in the risk of having a DFS event (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.588; 95% CI, 0.361-0.959; P = .0314). Compared with the delayed ZOL group, the immediate ZOL group had fewer local (0.4% vs 1.9%) and distant (3.8% vs 5.6%) recurrences, and fewer immediate than delayed ZOL patients developed bone metastases (1.7% vs 3.2%). Adverse events were similar between groups. Influenza-like symptoms were more common in the immediate than in the delayed ZOL group. Renal failure or impairment was less common in the immediate than in the delayed ZOL group (0.2% vs 0.6%). Osteonecrosis of the jaw occurred in 2 patients in the immediate ZOL group. The results of this analysis showed that early initiation of ZOL provided significant benefits in bone health and improved DFS in postmenopausal women receiving adjuvant AI therapy for early hormone-receptor positive breast cancer.

      "Content": "Feb 2, 2017 08:28AM - edited Feb 2, 2017 08:51AM by Husband11 My wife also had ascites that stemmed from her liver mets. In her case, the liver mets were causing obstruction of the blood flow through her liver, and the obstruction resulted in what they call hepatic hypertension (high blood pressure in a specific part of her system). The high blood pressure caused her to develop varisces (swollen veins) in her belly and esophagus, and also caused the ascites. The put her in both blood thinners and diuretics as part of the treatment of ascites and its cause. They drained her many times, as much as 5 liters in a week. They eventually installed a line so we could drain her at home. As the xeloda (an oral anti cancer drug) worked, but it took many months, the ascites eventually tapered off and and stopped. The line has now been removed, and she isn't accumulating fluid any more. Hopefully the treatment your wife receives will reverse her condition as well. Ask your Doc if its caused by hepatic hypertension. If so, you will want to keep an eye out for signs of internal bleeding as esophageal veins can bleed under increased pressure. They can do a scoping of her espophagus to look at them. The can also do an utrasound of her belly to see of veins are distended and measure blood flow rate. Not sure if the diuretics helped my wife, but that was something they tried. They are keeping her on blood thinners to prevent the clots from reoccuring, although that isn't an exact diagnosis of the cause, just an attempt at preventing it from coming back or getting worse as she has near total blockage of one of her hepatic arteries.",
