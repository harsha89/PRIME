I still have shooting pain and discomfort in that breast But I have a \"lump\" that is hard and unnerves me greatly. The surgeon says it is scar tissue. It is under the skin and below incision site an inch. How can this be scar tissue please??? Actually it is located at the bottom of the breast. I have had breast checks and mammogram that is fine. I still worry. Does anyone else have this problem?",
