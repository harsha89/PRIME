    "Content": "Juniper81 wrote: After I felt a hard spot in my right breast. I had mammo, ultrasound, and finally a byposy which showed DCIS. I was told most likely a lumpectomy and then sent for an MRI. MRI showed the DCIS pretty busy in my right and showed \"dots\" on the left. I was then told mastectomy on the right and because of the spots of major concerns on the left dual mastectomy. I walked out of the surgeons office numb. A day later it's all sinking in, do I do both? Do I get MRI biopsy for the left? Do I get implants? I am 36 with 5 and 1 year old kids and I am messed up. I am scared but do not want to rush into it. Not to mentioned 3 weeks ago my mother passed away. I am also already a ovarian cancer survivor over 8 years ago. Thank you for any advice or support. Log in to post a reply",
