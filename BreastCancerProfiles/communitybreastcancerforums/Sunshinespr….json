I am struggling with LE now and need my right arm/hand to write and type, etc for work, let alone life in general. I just recently started therapy as my upper arm has really swollen a lot and my hand and fingers are swelling lately also. They have used the arm and chest pump on me prior to wrapping to try to decongest and bring the size down so that I will then be able to get a sleeve. Found out my measurements suggest that I will need a custom sleeve (expensive). Hoping my insurance will cover it but, not too confident in that. Do the sleeves help a lot? I was told I will have to wear a sleeve pretty much the rest of my life. How cumbersome does this become? Or, do we just acclimate and get used to it? I was terrified of the possibility of lymphedema and now having it, hate it. I have been very positive thru the whole cancer diagnoses (two primarys at same time), chemo, mastectomy, lobectomy, radiation, pneumonitis from radiation and chemo, pneumonia, now LE. So many side effects from so many drugs, some lasting with CIPN, on Lyrica possibly forever to combat the pain. That causes hair thinning and weight gain on top of the prednisone I have been on for almost six months. (Sorry, venting......because family, friends and coworkers truly have NO idea.) Have to have ovaries removed next week due to inability to take tamoxifen and my estrogen/progesterone positive diagnoses. I will have my second mastectomy this fall due to high cancer risk in family. Just want to look forward to something....something good! I know, I am still here and that is good but, want to feel good about myself again. That\"s a daily struggle for me right now. Anyway, just looking for some good news that this will get easier. Hope everyone is doing well.",

I had a Radical Mastectomy April 28, 2015 and a Lobectomy on June 10. Two primary cancers at once. I am currently a Uniboober, too. I am also a large sized D on my left side and she misses her sister! lol I feel lopsided and am still pretty new to this so dressing is a horrible feat for me most days. I have also gained weight thru all this (20+ lbs) and am now on Lyrica for Chemo Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (hands and feet). The Lyrica is not helping me lose any weight either! ugh. Anyway, I have a strong history of cancer in my immediate family. Both of my sons have had childhood cancer. They are taking Lefty next spring. I am having a hysterectomy this fall. Before we knew about the lung cancer, the plan was clear. I was to have both breasts removed due to high risk and begin the recon stage. After the dx of lung cancer, too....plans changed. Drs just wanted to get me thru the two cancers. My LAST RADIATION is TODAY! Yippee!!!! It has done a number on my skin. I too have truncal Lymphedema and a little in my right arm. Anyway.....the plan had been to do the Tram Flap surgery but, now......I just don't know anymore. I have begun to hate the breast that's left. I hate to say that. But, it causes so many issues for me because she needs to be contained and most things I wear to contain the one side hurt the other side. I have not worn anything on the non-boob side. I don't care if anyone stares. I do get those stares but, I am quite content to uniboob around town. I work directly with the public all the time but, am more conscious of the one boob not being properly supported. lol Does anyone have any good ideas for this? Everywhere I look, I see NO bras that are comfortable enough and snug enough to support a uni. I appreciate any and all advice. You all are fantastic women. Stay strong for yourself and each other. God bless you all. ",

      "Content": "Aug 1, 2016 10:14AM - edited Aug 1, 2016 10:14AM by Sunshinesprite Hello everyone. Well, I was just in the ER Saturday for really bad pain in upper right abdomen. It had been going on since the evening before and was constant and severe. At ER, they found my liver enzymes which have been elevated since chemo had jumped quite a bit from last month. I already know I have Hepatic Steatosis (Fatty liver). Found this after chemo. Prior to chemo, was normal. Do not drink. But, until now, the levels were in the 40's and 50's. Now, 144 and 171. Just in past month. Nothing in diet has changed except my new hormone blocker, Femara. I was on Tamoxifen for a while, had issues. Was on Arimidex, had issues. This med seemed to be working until this. They feel it would be really rare if it is the med. I have read that gall bladder issues and gall stones can raise your liver enzymes. Anyone have any experience with this? Thank you all.  Dawn  ",

My younger son was diagnosed with ERMS Embryonal Rhabdomyosarcoma at age 6. He is here and 11 today. A month before his last scan (November 2014), I was diagnosed with Stage III, Grade 3 IDC. A few months later, and well into treatments for the breast cancer, I was diagnosed with Lung Cancer. I had a Radical Mastectomy on April 28th (my younger son's birthday) and a Lobectomy on June 10. All I can say is stay strong. Thank God your family are fighters. :) May God bless you all. ",
