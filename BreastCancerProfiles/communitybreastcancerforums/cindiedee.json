Sometimes you just have to give them more info than they have - I could have just paid the $312 but I knew I had already paid out $1100 on the PBM/Recon and had reached my max - so be sure and check it all out if they say you owe something towards the test.",

If there is a board for IBC, you can post all your info on that one - I haven't had IBC and only know a little about it. In the OR, they frequently do a frozen section - looking for BC - but they cannot be positive without the entire pathology. (My sister had a lumpectomy, they did the frozen section and came out and said \"all clear and no cancer\" - she went back to doc for a checkup about 10 days later and they sat her down and told her she had BC - so the frozen section may not be correct. The stages of BC are 1 through 4. I can't tell you what each one is specifically but I do know if your or anyone's cancer is Stage 4, that is the worst - usually means the cancer has already spread to other places in the body. I can only imagine how frightened you are this week - I will pray the week goes by very quickly for you and that you get some kind of answers. Many hugs, Cindie",

With the needle biopsy, they can't always get what they need to determine BC - what kind, what stage, etc - and I am a HUGE believer of \"the only good lump is the one in the jar\" - get the excisional biopsy and the lump will be just cut out totally - that way the entire thing can be biopsied. And you no longer have that lump. If it is IBC then you/they will know and a treatment plan can be formed - whether it includes surgery/chemo/rads - at least you will have a plan.

Let me tell you - I have had the worst nightmares the past 3 nights - every single night - I will bet I haven't slept 2 hours any night this week - just had nightmares - that they told me I was positive for BOTH BRCA 1 and BRCA 2, that DH and I were sitting with the GC and she was telling him I was going to die from this and I was crying - just awful stuff - the past 3 days it is ALL I have thought of. Well the phone rang this afternoon (and we have caller ID) and DH says \"it's the cancer center\" and I just KNEW it was THE call. It was like I was paralyzed and couldn't breathe - after 4 rings I finally answered the phone but I could barely speak. Then the GC says \"we are all shocked up here because of your pedigreed but you are NEGATIVE\"!!!!!!!!!!!!! I absolutely could not breathe at all at that point. Finally I asked her a couple of questions (\"are you POSTIVE that I am NEGAtIVE\" etc) and hung up and started bawling - which DH was sure meant I was positive - OMG - I am so lucky today and thank you God. I immediately emailed my son (he was at work) and told him. If y'all remember, my daughter is HORRIFIED that I did PBM/recon and told me she NEVER wanted to know my BRCA testings status - so then I wondered if I should tell her or not. Well God answered that question for me - 5 minutes later my granddaughter called and we chatted about her day - 20 minutes later my daughter got on the phone and just hearing her voice started me bawling! So I told her I had a gift for her and I told her - she acted like it was no big deal - kind of like \"well I don't have to worry about that then\" and she changed the subject and started chatting! I have been bawling on and off the rest of the afternoon - with my family history, I just can't believe I am in the lucky 50% - thank you God! Hugs to all, Cindie Log in to post a reply",

That being said, for your daughter's sake, I hope you do the test - if you are negative, then your daughter cannot have the BRCA1 or 2 mutated gene.  If you are positive, then your daughter has a 50/50 chance of also having the mutated gene.  Keep in mind one thing - every single doc I have seen about this has said that BRCA 1 and 2 are the only BC genes currentlly known to increase risk - but that there are probably another 100 BC genes out there that science just hasn't found and identified yet.  I am what is called an \"uninformed negative\" - meaning no one else in my family has (or will) test - but my great grandma and my mom both died from BC and my sister had BC 3 times before she had a double mastectomy at age 39.  Because of my family history and I also had so many biopsies and lumps removed, I decided to have a PBM with SGAP reconstruction - and I sleep so much better at night knowing I have done all that I can to reduce my risk and to \"get it(BC)\" \"before it gets me\".  I had already had a complete hysterectomy many years ago, so at least I didn't have to do that at the same time. My heart goes out to you being the first family \"history\" - and for your daughter having to go through all this at such a young age. Hugs and Blessings, Cindie",
