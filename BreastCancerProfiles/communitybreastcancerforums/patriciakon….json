My Lymphedema Specialist bought one of these for me to try.(size XL: I am 5'9\", 185 lbs, age 75) They are on sale right now, as are several similar \"shapewear\" camos. I have truncal lymphedema, and the compression below the bra line is so important. I ordered 5 different shirts (including a larger one of these) for $88.00 total on Amazon (We have Prime). I think I could sleep in the XXL! It is so hard to find helpful garments that we can just buy outright, without the hassle of going through insurance.",
