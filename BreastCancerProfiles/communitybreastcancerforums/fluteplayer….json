This helped immensely. If you've ever given birth to a child, use your breathing and calming skills to help relax...it really does help. I did not have any problems; even receiving the local anesthetic was not problematic. Since I had two tumors in the left quadrant of my breast, I had two wires inserted in close proximity to each other. The staff taped them down for me, as my surgery was not scheduled until much later in the day. As for pain following the lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy, I experienced pain - there is no way I would have been able to go back to work the following day - I had mine done on a Thursday and ended up going back about 10 days later - emotionally, I was pretty exhausted and think that had more to do with the later return than anything. I just went through a re-exisicion 2 days ago. Best of luck to you - stay calm and trust that you are stronger than you ever imagined! Hugs and Blessings",

After much investigation and prayer, I have decided to undergo four rounds of TC, to start some time in September. I need to do whatever possible to make sure every ugly cell is not given a chance to come back...Reading through each of your posts has been helpful and I'm grateful you can share your experiences. krcll: I, too, am a musician (can you guess by my user name my instrument?). I do not play for a living, but can certainly empathize with your concerns...as I understand it, the pathology done during surgery is a \"gross\" look at the tissue/nodes, etc. and gives a pretty good picture of what's going on, but further pathology is done to give the complete picture. So, I don't think it's unusual that something came up on the final pathology. Mine showed a need for reexcision as the margins were only at .1 cm and we needed 1 cm margins. Hang in there.       This journey has caused many feelings of  being ticked off that this is happening and I also experienced extreme fatigue after my first surgery on 08/06. Now, I don't sleep, worrying about side effects of chemo. So, each of your experiences helps me to know what to expect. Someone above mentioned that they like to have all the information possible - that is me exactly. I don't deal well with the unknown. Peace to each of you this day.",

I still can't believe this is happening sometimes; even though I have the huge ugly scars from the lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy. My heart aches for those women out here who have to face far greater challenges than me...I am blown away by how many women are affected by this.  Please know that you are not alone and to continue \"talk therapy\" and drug therapies...hopefully, you will find some comfort and peace along the way. This venue has also been most helpful; I waited for over a month to join after my dx; wish I would have jumped aboard far more quickly.  Keep us posted and know that you have many \"sisters\" in this vein pulling for you! Hugs!",
