    "Content": "CarolinaGirl34 wrote: I finished 20 treatments of radiation the first week of March. About 5 weeks ago my breast became very warm and swollen. A few nights later when I layed down in bed I was in excruciating pain. Went to see my oncologist and my surgeon, a CT scan was done and didn't reveal anything except fluid buildup which was drained. Went back this week and had more fluid drained. Still having terrible pain when trying to turn from side to side in bed. Has anyone else had similar complications Log in to post a reply",
