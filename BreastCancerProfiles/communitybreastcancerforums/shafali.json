Did 2 cycles of Herceptin with Taxotere, followed by 6 cycles of Herceptin with Navelbine. Now am doing 4 cycles of just Herceptin. Then a PET scan and then we shall see. Each time it rears its ugly head, just fight it with whatever works. The side effects do sometime seem as bad as the disease .......... Hope you are feeling better. Love Bubble    ",

ER+, PR+, Her2neu+++, Surgery, chemo and radiation folloed by Tamoxifen for 3 years and Arimidex for 6 months. Mets was caught in the annual scans in April 2007. It is in one area on the spine. Removing it wasn't even an option that we discussed.   I was put on further hormonal treatment (Aromasin) and a bone strengthener called Bonronate which is like Zometa but in tablet form - It's not commonly used in US but is quite common in Europe (and is made by the same pharma company which makes Herceptin). But since both, my doc and I, wanted to be really aggressive we decided to move to chemo + Herceptin and continue with Bondronate. I started this treatment in Aug 2007 and the pain disappeared after the very first dose. I finish the course in April and then am planning on having a PET scan to check on things and plan the next course of action with my Oncologist. I too feel that since the problem is in one area alone, the chances of getting rid of it are that much better. Did you have any blood test for tumour markers? Also is your doc planning to do a PET scan to confirm the diagnosis. Couple of things that I have read about on the net and some stuff which other women on these sites have told me: - No one dies of just bone mets - It is the easiest to manage and treat - Most of the docs now consider it a chronic disease like diabetes and so on - All the statistics on the net should be ignored as each person is different and I read of many women living with mets (not just bone mets) for 15 / 20 years and more.  - Also all the statistics are for the older treatments - they don't really reflect the success of the newer treatments I am glad that you are getting a second opinion on things - it helps so much. Hope you are doing better. Let me know what treatment you are planning to take. Hugs Bubble",
