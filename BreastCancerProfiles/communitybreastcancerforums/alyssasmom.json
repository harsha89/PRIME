      "Content": "alyssasmom wrote: I went back today for my second mammo because of having some benign density's and calcifications. They did a mammo and ultrasound. Dr came in and said there doesn't seem to be anything to be concerned about, no tumers but she said the calcifications in the right breast were like a small cluster. Also, in both breast were a small benign mass. She said because of the sizes of the masses and that they were in (both breast)does that make any sense?? that she wasn't to concerned but beings this was my first mammo they have nothing to compare it to she has to give me these options.... wait 6 months and recheck Biopsy have them removed she made the comment that she has seen a LOT of mammo's and she doesn't think I have anything to be concerned about. But I am so scared and don't know what to do. Couple questions if anyone could answer.... Do you think the masses didn't show up on the first mammo? If they told me they were benign, why do they do biopsy's? Anyone give me some info on the biopsy's. She said one would be done on my back with ultrasound and the other 2 for the masses would be done on my stomach???? Are the biopsy's pretty bad? Pain? how long does it take? I'm so confused and scared, I guess I am the biggest baby when it comes to pain lol A family member had ovarion cancer and she has a call in to her Dr. right now to ask his opinion who is a specialist so I may go to him for a second opinion. To top it all off I suffer with Anxiety and this is making it so much harder for me Log in to post a reply",
