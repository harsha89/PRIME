I know I have a 3 x 1.5cm spiculated mass 5cm from the nipple in the 8 o clock position. I have been seen by OBGYN - radiologist - surgical oncologist who wants me to come in Monday for core biopsy - portacath placement - lymph node dissection. I was told based on ultrasound (3) and mammo that he was certain it was cancer.Â  My sister is a radiologist by trade who has worked closely in breast cancer imaging for 20 years. She suggested this course of treatment without PETs, MRIs, ultrasound guided biopsy, genetic testing etc was antiquated. Any advice? I don't even know what questions to ask. Thanks for a point in the right direction!",
