What a day.  What a MONTH actually -- as I have been dodging medical bullets left and right it seems (thyroid biopsy last week, which is full of nodules - but benign, thankfully..  and 2 masses on my liver, also benign - but I need to have them removed asap).  I'm feeling that \"how long can my luck hold out\" feeling, to say the least.  :)  It's comforting to read that the biopsy's not too bad..  my thyroid biopsy was not pleasant, but at least I'm somewhat prepared.  Please keep us posted on what you find out....  fingers crossed.",

Any time something on your body is not right - whether it's a funny looking mole or a strange rash - see a doctor.  That's what they're for - even if it turns out to be nothing. I have a 19 y.o. daughter - and I would tell her what I'm going to tell you:  See a doctor.  You're right - you're young, no history of bc in your family, and most likely fit and healthy.  So any lump that appears on your breast (or anywhere) should be looked at by a physician - now.  Please don't wait. Don't be scared either -- imagine your relief when you find out that it's just a cyst or an infection... and you will be proud of yourself for taking control over YOUR health.  You have a long wonderful life ahead of you, so get this taken care of, and then you can get back to life as usual.  Ok? Go get it checked.  :)",
