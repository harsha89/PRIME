My last infusion is tomorrow-even though I'm thrilled to be at the last one, I'm terrified of the se possibilities. Last cycle was pretty awful. I'm heading for surgery (not sure of specific plans yet) next followed by radiation. Please know that you're posts are important to people who are not always sharing their thoughts. Good luck to all!

The info you share is really helpful. I follow you guys closely for all of your terrific info and support. Welcome helpfulyogi! Everyone reacts differently so it is hard to say how much support you will need on infusion days. I only had one so far and could have driven myself. The experience is pretty overwhelming so having someone with you is really helpful. Bcrohde- glad you're feeling better! AngelaKS glad to hear you're feeling a bit better too! Have a good night everyone!",

Fortunately, I had spoken to anesthesia folks in advance and they had a few options waiting for me. Arm stiffness and pain is worse than any chest discomfort. I'll post again soon. Glad to be home before the predicted snow storm. Luck to anyone with upcoming surgery!",
