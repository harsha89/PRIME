I was relieved to learn that both sides were cancer-free, and I congratulated the surgeon that neither incision hurt.  She was a bit concerned about the \"swelling\", i.e. lumpiness around each node/underarm, and said it was fluid.   She volunteered to aspirate them, but I elected not to since the fluid will recede and it does not hurt.  Time will heal and I am so relieved not to have had pain, numbness, or cancer in nodes. Hope that helps those of you who are also a bit swollen.   If it doesn't hurt.... no need to worry! s Sue",

But, it was the right side; my dominant side, that had residual lymphadema.  I had discomfort down my right arm and swelling in my right hand. The Lymphadema physical therapist helped a great deal with their special massage, and provided sleeves and gloves for me to use post-double masectomy, which came after chemotherapy.  It turns out that after the masectomies and the removal of my chemo port, all of the swelling in my right hand went away.  You may want to ask your doctor about a recommendation for therapists in your area who specifically treat Lymphadema.  Or, check out the Lymphadema thread on this board. \"Binny\" is our resident expert!  (Don't worry, lymphadema is not as terrifying as it sounds. Mine is all gone now, and yours will be too, soon!) Sue",

I'm 56 now, but when I was about 35 I had to take Lupron after having one ovary removed because of severe endometriosis.  The ovary removal wasn't so bad, but the Lupron injections made me feel like I thought an 80 year old woman must've felt; every bone and muscle ached!  I was supposed to do Lupron for 6 months - it was still experimental and cost a fortune back then.  Anyway, I only tolerated about 3 or 4 months and gave up.  My periods came back and in my mid 40s I started an early menopause (only had 1 half functioning ovary by then, anyway), and it was much easier to get into \"gradual\" menopause than the Lupron injections.  Now that I'm TN, the estrogen removal isn't that much of a concern.    I guess we're all different, but I for one, would elect ovary removal over Lupron.  But, maybe they've made it more tolerable now, too.  Good luck!

I'm 56, exactly - just turned it an hour ago!  No kids, kinda separated from a husband who's relatively detached from me anyway, parents gone, blah blah blah.  Sometimes I feel pretty lonely, and a bit scared.  But, those feelings fortunately, are fleeting, because I try not to dwell on them and remind myself to keep focusing on more positive things.   Since the New Year, I've been making small positive changes in my life to improve my health and keep this beast (bc) from coming back.  I've lost 25 lbs. and quit smoking (most of the time!  ...but, I don't beat myself about it when I fall of the smoking wagaon, otherwise, I'd just quit quitting, and I don't want to do that). Anyway, I guess I'm really trying to live one day at a time and it must be working because I'm calmer about things (For example, I haven't worked in 6 months but, I'm not yet freaking out. I know that the universe will eventually provide!) Years ago, after my father died, I went on an anti-depressant because I couldn't stop crying just a little everyday. I know it's supposed to take weeks for them to start working but I swear the very first day I took my first pill, I didn't cry.  I no longer use them, but... I think that it might help you to try them. I think I was on zoloft.  My onc tried to get me to go back on them with the bc diagnosis, and I did thru chemo. But, I'm off now and doing OK. Don't look at it as something you'd always need to take - just something that can help you through the rough spots.   And, keep reaching out to everyone on this board.  They're all wonderful!!!  Personally, there have been many days when reading Kona's posts have either brought a smile to my face, or literally kept me going.  She's one of the treasures here, who has a great knack for putting things in perspective, often in a very funny;/humorous way!   Anyway.... hang in there JudyAnn!  Things will get better!  I definitely think you should do your chemo.  It's not as bad as the tv and movies make it out to be. And, like Kona says... it gives you more hope of a healthier/happier tomorrow, when you'll no longer need to be focused entirely on getting well.   Please let us know how you're doing, and feel free to PM me if you'd like to talk.  Sue",

(Constipated, yes!). And with chemo, they give you so much anti-nausea medication, that the only reason to get nauseous anymore is not taking it.   That's what happened to me on my last treatment. I didn't take my anti-nausea meds (because I figured I didn't really need it) and 2 or 3 days after the chemo, I threw up; the first time on my last treatment, merely because I didn't take the meds. So, don't worry about getting nauseous. I hate it too, and it didn't happen. We're all different. The most important thing you can do for yourself is keep a positive attitude and know that you can get through this. Yes, it's definitely something to get through. And there will be days you'll want nothing but your life back.  But, you'll get through it and you'll be fine.  And yes, you'll get your life back!  Best of luck to you.  We're all in this together... sue",

Does s/he think the biopsy is critical/necessary, or is s/he satisfied with watching it carefully via mammo and/or ultrasound?   I would certainly try to speak to the doctor yourself, until you feel more comfortable about the process; and how you can be certain that the new lumps are not bc, without biopsy.  If s/he feels that a biopsy is the best thing to do, perhaps s/he can convince your mother to go ahead with the procedure.  On a positive note, remember that a very small percentage (I can't remember the exact figure) are cancer. So don't be consumed with fear.

Perhaps it has to do with air circulation and the fact that the material the pads are made of are designed to keep moisture in.  I always had to encourage my mom to drink plenty of water too - which would also help prevent UTIs.  Every time I brought her to the ER for one thing or another, she was always dyhdrated. I may be over-generalizing, but I think the WWII generation grew up without drinking much water.   Hope you find a doctor who will get to the bottom of it, soon!  Sue",

But I wanted to chime in to let you know that I'm 55 and last week had Stage 2 DIEP revisions. I had an appt. with my PS today and we're both thrilled with the results. I told her that even without such a good cosmetic outcome, I think DIEP is/was the way to go - and she agrees. So, I wish you luck on your DIEP adventure.  It's definitely worth the extra research and trouble! Sue",

And, they found a 7mm ER positive in my right.  So....while it's not great news, I'm glad they found them both at the same time and now I know what I have to do. I'm in chemo now, and in Jan. I will have bilateral mast. and reconstruction. Then, hopefully, I'll get my life back and all will be well.  But, I'm grateful that they were both found now so that I don't have to go through this again.  Good luck to you!  Hoping the other one's a cyst or b9, too. If not, you'll be fine... anyway. And glad they found it! sue p.s.  What I found with all the waiting is... go ahead and take the valium! :)",

Got lymphedema mildly on right - not on left. Anyway, my PS sent me to a lymphadema specialist who is also a physical therapist so we've been working on a lot of muscle issues and stretching. The cording seemed to go away after about 2 - 3 weeks of stretching and massaging, but I still have a bit of lymphadema swelling on my hand. Sorry I don't have better answers, but others who know more about lymphedema will be around soon. I just wanted you to know that the cording may very well be a result of the SNB... but it goes away fairly quickly with a little attention.  Good luck! sue",

I saw your post and since I had bilat with DIEP in Jan '09, I thought I might be able to help a little.  First off, if none of the surgical sites hurt at all, you're doing good!  Your pain meds are probably working fine too. But, your pain meds may be causing the heart burn. I have no idea about the aching lower back, other than those skimpy hospital mattresses?   I was in the hospital for 7 days, 4 of which were in intensive care.  I wasn't really walking around much for the first 4 days, since they were concerned that I might have to go back to the OR to repair the left side.  Anyway, it all worked out. But, I think you should ask your doctors or nurses when you should be walking, and how much.  As for the pain, keep hounding them about that too.   The swelling can last quite a while though.  I'm three months out and still have some swelling on my right side. I remember during the 4th week post op thinking that I was healing very slowly because I was still very swollen. It turns out I had mild truncal lymphadema. It's almost all gone now. Don't worry - it takes time, but eventually you'll feel very much like your old self again!  Good luck! Sue",

      "Content": "Mar 3, 2010 09:12AM - edited Mar 3, 2010 09:14AM by 2z54 Hi 3k, Just a word of caution, and personal tale... When diagnosed in 7/08, I worked for one of the America's best employers, a high tech company that starts with \"G\".  (The company that hired me had been bought out by them).   Well, I worked through chemo but went on disability leave afterward for surgery.  When I returned from surgery I had the boss from hell. At the original company I had had an agreement to work from home 2 days a week.  It was a long commute, so because of my mild lymphadema, I requested an extra laptop to keep at home.  My boss rolled her eyes like that was a huge request, reserved primarily for executives. But, I got it.   Within 2 months I also started getting warning reviews.  In one review, it was mentioned that I was not \"focused\".  I sent HR an article about chemo brain that I found on this website, to help them understand other cancer patients that might be in their employ.  I finally responded to my last warning, which was actually a Performance Improvement Plan with a letter of discrimination to HR (I was 55 and a cancer survivor).  To make a long story short, I believe that my high tech company wasn't too interested in nurturing aged cancer survivors, and in fact, were on a mission to rid themselves of me.  I finally hired a lawyer who got me some severance, although I believe I could have eventually won a discrimination suit.  But, it would have taken years and I just wanted \"out\" of the daily micromanagement and harrassment. Long story short again; HR is not our friend.  They are paid to protect the company.  If I were you, I would stay under HRs radar. The company knows you have cancer; they will always know whether it's in your review or not.  Best to play it safe and be satisfied with whatever promotions come or do not come.  Bringing more attention to yourself only makes you vulnerable, and sometimes companies want to rid themselves of problem children.  Best of luck to you!

So, I took that month between chemo and surgery off to try to get in shape, i.e. exercise, eat well, etc.  At the point I decided to take \"pre-surgery\" time off, we asked for a total of 3 months, and it was granted - and pretty standard.  (I should add that I had worked from home during chemo from Sept. thru Dec. 1)  My disability leave started Dec. 1 and I was supposed to be back at work on March 1, or so.  However, I didn't heal as quickly or as well as we hoped - probably because of the chemo first and my age (54), and we requested another 2 months at the end of Feb.  The extra 2 months were granted and I returned to work on May 3 or so.  I was lucky to have company-issued disability insurance.  Many years ago I had my own business and didn't have disability coverage. It really came in handy! Sue",

Today I had my BRAC tests, because..... every woman on my father's side has died of breast cancer or had masectomy (2 aunts in early 70s and grandmother - not sure what age of masectomy).  The geneticist told me I have a 65% chance of having the mutation.  I'm almost positive I do, and because I already have one 3.5 cm trip neg. in left breast and a very small (7mm trip positive) in right breast... I'll do the masectomies.  The question now is what about the ovaries?  I'm 54 and already in menopause.  I'm not looking forward to estrogen therapy for the small lump, but I guess I'll do whatever they tell me to do.   If you can get the test... it sounds like a good idea.  For me, it will confirm the decision to have the bilateral, help me to decide about the ovaries, and give my niece more information than I ever had when I was growing up.
