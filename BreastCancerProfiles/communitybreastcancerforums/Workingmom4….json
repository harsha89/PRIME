SailingWind - My tattoos are extremely small also, I had trouble seeing them as well.  The techs doing my treatment today jokingly said that the tech who gave me my tattoos was very generous by making them so small, they were having a hard time seeing them too. So far, so good...  Only noticeable change I had was that my skin was radiating like I'd been in the sun too long.",
