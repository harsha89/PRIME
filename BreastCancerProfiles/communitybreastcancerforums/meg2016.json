The best advice I got from her was: 1) Practice the script ahead of time. Literally rehearse it and if you need to, read it (or at least have bullet points written out.) Its emotional and hard to get through without crying, this will help. 2) Anticipate their questions and answer them before they ask (and even if they don't ask they are likely wondering) which include: `- Who will take care of us while you are sick? - Will you die? - Will you lose your hair? - Can I get it (like a cold) or will I get it when I am older? - Who are people I can talk to about this if I have questions or am scared but don't feel like I can talk to you? (it helps if you have a list of other family members you've told or family friends, even a school counselor or a teacher.) - Be honest, but you don't need to provide too much detail right up front. The detail can unfold as you find out. Its ok to say we don't know everything right now, but we will share it when we know it. I dreaded the conversation with my kids but it was such a relief when I had it and honestly, they suspect something is up, they are super perceptive, so sooner than later would be my advice.",

Because of my breast density, my cancer never really showed up on the mammogram even after the diagnostic ultrasound when they knew where to look. All of this is not to be scary, just to say I would push for additional screening if I were you. It will give you peace of mind if nothing else. I wish I had pushed harder for additional screenings earlier. With all the family risk, that should qualify you for an MRI- have you asked for that as an option? I asked about ultrasound as a screening tool and they said they normally refer dense breast patients for an MRI. You are smart to be proactive about this!",

My husband jokes that it is Cancer Disney because it seems everyone is so friendly. My experience at Brigham and Women's for surgery was outstanding. At both DF and B&W through every phase the nurses, techs, etc all seem to follow a very standard protocol of introducing themselves, telling you what their role is, checking on you within a certain time-frame to make sure you are still ok, etc. I started this process at a large, teaching hospital in a large city (but not Dana Farber ) and they were struggling to get all my needed scans, etc done within the same week. Dealing with them was a lot of work. At DF, they scheduled them all for the same day! So I travel a distance to go there, but it is worth the hassle of travel for the ease of treatment there for sure. I have also never felt rushed in an appointment, this has been true for my MO, BS, PS, and RO, even infusion nurses, etc. I am trying to think of the negative... Boston traffic, I guess? I really can't come up with much else. Occasionally I get a little lost trying to find a new place (like if I am having a test done at a different place than I have been before,) But that is also true at home. At Brigham and Women's, the pre-op area and recovery area could use some improvement, it was just curtained areas but you aren't there very long (my understanding is that they were doing construction and so they were using another area temporarily.) But my room itself was private and very nice. I was at the Faulkner facility (there are a few B&W locations.) I left my initial oncologist very early for a second opinion and DF required many scans to be redone. And some (including my pathology) had different results, so that was interesting. But as I have considered coming back to my local oncologist, I keep going back to DF. And no question, if you are interested in trials, they have a large number going on and the trial nurses are also terrific.",

If you find the Tissue Expander thread you will find lots of others that have had the same. In my case, even if I had natural tissue reconstruction they wanted to wait until after radiation and I needed expanders placed to stretch the skin. So in either case I would have had the same initial surgery. The expanders are not fun, and they have to expand you quickly so as to not delay radiation. That was a month or six weeks of having pain, muscle spasms, having to sleep at an incline, etc. But now (I am three months post BMX and three months pre-exchange) I'm glad I did it. The expanders are just part of my day to day, I barely notice them. I will be glad for the exchange, but its very manageable to have them in. The hardest part for me has been not being able to exercise my pectorals as much (because the expanders are under your pecs, they typically don't want you to build pec muscles and push on the expanders until after your exhcange.) I did a lot of yoga/pilates before and now I have to modify it to not use pecs as heavily. Also, no underwire bras and also they want me wearing a bra at all times. The expanders are hard, and you can even bump them into things because they stick out quite a bit. Hugging people makes me feel like I am ramming them with a brick. :) I can't speak to the final result yet since I am not there, but right now cosmetically I am quite happy with how my skin has stretched despite radiation trying to contract it and overall even after radiation things look good.

My mom had already been tested, so I already knew that I was unlikely to have the gene but was tested anyway and it was negative. Similar to Mom_of_twins I believe mine also has an inherited component, but perhaps it isn't a specific gene, maybe we are high hormone producers or something of that nature. But if I could have done something to prevent this, like perhaps going on Tamoxofin after I was done having kids, it would have been worth it. And in cases like mine with a strong family history, some prevention is being offered and I hope one day there will more available for my kids. Genetic testing is a very personal choice- if you are considering it you might want to talk to a genetic counselor, they can help you understand the possible results and what they may mean for you and your daughters. I was also in school when my mother was diagnosed and at the time (I was 19) I didn't understand the possible implications for me, I was just worried about my mom's health. She didn't have genetic testing done when she was originally diagnosed and I didn't even think about it. After I had daughters then I wanted to know and asked her to see if she could get genetic testing done, which she did some years ago. And despite my mom and my negative genetic test, my daughters will still be high risk and due to my younger diagnosis will probably start screenings in their 20's. So I do think regardless of the testing results, its important to think about what risk may be for your daughters and let them know so they can plan. Also, I encourage you to just keep really good records. It was actually quite helpful for me to have my mom's medical records to be able to see whether I had the same type as hers, have her genetic test results, etc. A lot has changed since she had it, but a lot hasn't. This also helped with the genetic counseling discussion. Sorry I don't have a specific recommendation because I think its such an individual decision. Me personally, I like ALL the information, so I wanted to know. I know everyone is different though with how much information they want, and whether they want it all at once. BC brings with it such information overload. Genetic testing is an easy blood test and can be done any time. So if you decide you don't want to do it now but do it down the road, thats also an option. There were a lot of changes between when my mom did it several years ago and when I did in the number of things they could detect, so its constantly evolving.",

This is supported by recent studies we discussed, so I am in agreement for now. I am going to try to ovarian suppression drug with the AI for awhile. If it seems like I am tolerating the side effects, it might be easier to go ahead and do the oopherectomy than to continue to get a monthly shot for 5-10 years. My oncologist did say sometimes insurance doesn't want to pay for surgery unless you have genetic tests to indicate ovarian cancer risk (and I don't.) But she believes this is why it isn't more common among the non-BRCA but high-risk population. It seems crazy to me that insurance companies are willing to pay for a monthly shot which is given at a clinic for years, and not a one-time outpatient surgery. But she also said they are having some success with the making the case that if women choose oopherectomy it is a valid alternative and convincing insurers to cover it. reflect I have a 12-year old daughter, so not quite to that age yet, but she also doesn't talk about it much. Its hard to know how they are processing, if they are talking to anyone, etc. Glad you have a counselor, hopefully that will help. I just keep hoping the fact that at this age they are mostly self-absorbed will keep her mind off of worrying about me.",

Mine is left side, so I am really only worried about lungs, and even then I am not super worried. What is interesting to me with this trial is straightaway they make sure your insurance will pay for Proton. So they are going to bill you for it either way. Lots of people apparently are kicked out at that point from even participating. So its a chicken and egg problem- they can't prove its effective to then get insurance to pay for it because insurance won't pay for it to prove its effective. Ugh.",

I think I have three prescriptions, a little unsure where to start and why I would want to switch, etc. I didn't need any of them during Taxol (which is good news) but am prepared to use them when I need them!",

So I went from thinking I was a stage II to now a stage III due to the lymph nodes because my tumors are quite small. Mine are very aggressive, so even though I am highly ER/PR+, the hope was that the grade 3 would respond well to chemo. We could feel it working and surgery resulted in clean margins (I had one very near chest wall) so that is good I guess. I meet with my oncologist to talk next steps this Friday, so its great to hear about these trials as options. I am getting ready to begin radiation and hormone therapy as well.

My RCB is 3.69- they call that a 3, but to me thats looking a lot like a 4. I could feel dramatic shrinkage in the cancer bed in my breast during chemo, and MRI scans showed shrinkage, so that makes me think things were quite bad when I began treatment. So I probably should just clean out the 401K and start traveling now. Bali, here we come! Actually, I am kind of doing that, have two bucket list trips planned for next year, one just after radiation and planning one for summer. I will say, being on the more extreme end of this disease makes some things easier for me than others with a less advanced diagnosis. For example, maybe I am having side effects on Aromasin/Lupron, I do have some joint pain but I am just not too focused on it. And long-term there are side effects. But I have to be around for years before I can worry too much about osteoporosis or damage from radiation, etc. The longer term side effects just don't keep me up at night. Its the shorter term recurrence or spread that take up all my worry energy. I am also really struggling with what truly is evidence-based best diet for us. I have read Mediterranean, low sugar, carb, etc. Low inflammation diet makes logical sense. But also very interesting in the data on Ketogneic. I have a friend with a different cancer in a study on Ketogenic- its a hard diet to maintain. But if it works... if anyone has any studies they have stumbled across in their time with Dr. Google, would love to read more.",

You want your hand resting on the ball so there is space between your body and the ball and then you roll the ball away from your body, leaning toward it, stretching out that side. Do it on both sides or alternate sides if you have two balls. The same starting position but rolling forward toward in front of your body and back also helped.",

So the thought is that the HER2 parts shrunk away during chemo, the rest was shrinking but not as quickly. And more chemo may just continue to have the same effect. I have been having zero menopausal symptoms during chemo. So she feels that the best action is to try to get the estrogen out of the equation asap. I will also continue Herceptin. I still have radiation to go, so while on radiation, I will try the ovarian suppression and AI and see how it goes. But I'd love to continue to see what others are doing.

I am leaning in that direction, have to get through radiation first, so it will be next year before I can get it done. My oncologist does not really discuss my personal odds- she will talk about stats when we are discussing studies, risk reduction from a particular treatment, etc.And if there are things that have similar percentages, she will take them to the tumor board for discussion for my case. But she does not give me an overall percentage for recurrence for me. We did discuss it briefly, but between two types of chemo, herceptin, radiation and now the ovarian suppression, there are a lot of variables in play, so its hard to pin down the math even if she were willing. She likes to say we have thrown everything and the kitchen sink at this- so my odds are as good as they can possibly be. I also feel like my surgeon was excellent and I do believe surgical skill comes into play with recurrence risk as well. So I am trying to be ok with just knowing that everything in the arsenal was used. And yet I don't feel like I have been over-treated at any point. The other day my daughter asked me about her friend's mother, who had all the same treatments I am having, yet her cancer came back and how do we know mine won't as well? It was all I could do to not just cry at that moment and agree with her and say \" that thought scares me every day\" -instead I told her that we are doing every single thing we can but we never know 100%. And then realized later I basically said the same thing my oncologist says to me. The part that my husband is struggling more with is the lack of scans. I expected that since I have been on these forums and know that once you complete treatment, you pretty much just sit around and wait for symptoms. By the time this cancer had symptoms, it was very far along as far as lymph node spread, etc. so thats not comforting. Although even if my oncologist agreed to frequent scans, I am not sure what scan I would want that would even make me feel at ease.",

I don't know enough about skin involvement to say anything about that specific scenario since I didn't have that in my case, but it sounds like just getting the second opinion at this point would help you with a path forward that you feel comfortable with. Mom- I did appreciate that article a LOT. I have read so much about RCB that is so vague but its actually even scarier, this put some numbers to it, which while scary at least feel like facts. (And good to know that Hormone treatment, etc still make a difference in my case.) It's odd to me that from about 2007-2013 RCB seems to have been a hot topic and well studied, now it seems to have dropped off the radar a bit... yet still is being used by some on pathology. I just wonder how its being used today, plan to ask at my next MO appt. I didn't come up when we reviewed my path report, but I noticed it myself. Even though these articles can be scary, this information I have found helpful in advocating for myself. If you have read the studies and have data, it definitely helps to back up any requests I might have for treatment options or even just information. I tend to find that MO's only give the information they sense you want, if its scarier they don't provide unless asked. I like to have all the information, but I know not everyone is that way. And I totally agree- there is a lot more than this RCB score (and by the way, didn't seem like this study touched on radiation or ovary suppression, etc. which seems to leave out a piece of the stats puzzle.) Reflect- The ketogenic diet is a more extreme version of Adkins, but yes, definitely similar. But even more carb restrictive. My understanding is that it can be dangerous if you are not working with a dietitian. I hear of it used much more in other types of cancer. My nutritionist at DF has said she has no evidence that it is recommended for breast cancer (of course, that means it hasn't been studied or that the results aren't in yet.) But I know a lot of people using integrative medicine that are going in that direction, my integrative medicine nutritionist asked me if I wanted to consider it. So I have been researching, just can't find much. There was no way I could have managed it on top of chemo anyway, but now that I believe my cancer was not so responsive to chemo, I am definitely exploring other avenues. I also can't lose much weight on Radiation, so need to be careful with diet at the moment and just maintain, so for now just exploring things in my google sessions.",

My top advice: 1) Once you go home, set an alarm to have someone give you pain meds at night on the schedule for when they will wear off for the first couple of nights. Have someone keep a chart of when you took things, lots of pills between pain meds, antibiotics, probiotics, stool softeners, etc etc. ina ddition to your drain outputs. 2) After a couple days when you want to try to pare down the pain meds, alternate the strong stuff wtih Tylenol (assuming its ok with whatever they give you). The Tylenol took the edge off when the pain meds wore off and allowed me to get further stretches between taking them and gradually wean onto just tylenol. 3) Keep up the stool softeners! Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate. 4) Don't leave the hospital until you feel 100% confident with (a) being able to get in and out of bed and and to bathroom, etc. (b) the exercises you need to do when you get home and how to do them (c) how to clean your drains and measure output and (c) have your pain under control. 5) Have a good way to sleep almost sitting up when you get home, i.e. in a recliner or on lots of pillows and a wedge in the bed. Have a pillow or other cushion for the seatbelt when riding in the car on the way home. 6) Get a good Netflix show to watch or similar and just rest. The pain meds may make you feel like you can do more than you should, so just take it easy! I'm happy to answer any questions! Good luck!",

Then I can go back to worrying about recurrence. :) Hope everyone is doing well!",

I do think in my case if I hadn't done chemo and this cancer did come back, I would always beat myself up for not trying chemo. Especially as a parent. I had multi-focal disease so while I still had a high residual cancer burden after surgery, I wonder what it was before chemo? So I try to make peace with the fact that I made each decision of treatment with the information I had at the time and ultimately threw everything medically at this that I possibly could.",

This part is hard- waiting for results and a treatment plan and can be scary. For me it got easier once I knew the plan for moving forward. You should find lots of support here! You may want to ask where you are being seen if they have a social worker. Where I go they were able to provide a lot of resources for talking to my kids (and even a care bag for each of them with age-appropriate material, etc.)",
