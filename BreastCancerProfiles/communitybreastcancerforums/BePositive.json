That is the option that I am to do although I have not met with the plastic surgeon yet. I had a mastectomy and the clear margin was very small, not to mention 4 positive lymph nodes and lymphovascular invasion. Radiation to the chest wall (i.e. where the breat used to be) will kill any cancer cells that may have been left behind. BePositive",
