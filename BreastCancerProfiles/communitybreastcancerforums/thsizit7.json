I was fine in just a few min. They gave me more steroids and Zantac in IV, waited about 20 min and I took the rest of the bag with no problem. From now on I will have to double up on the steroids the day before, morning of, and in the drip before chemo to tolerate it. I was afraid they would not give it to me again and change to something else, but they said the double steroids would take care of it. I want to take that combo of drugs, PHT because of the huge success rate. I can deal with steroids, it doesn't make me jittery just lots of energy...I think I will have a very clean house during this ordeal !!! I've had no problems with my port. Don't even realize it is there now. I go back next Tue to let my surgeon check it. Don't know if I will make it to my 2nd round before hair starts to come out... this morning when I combed through it strands of hair came out from the root! I can pull a strand here and there and it will just pop out...kind of freaky!!! If it continues like this I will call my hairdresser and up the date to get it shaved... I refuse to watch it fall out! I'm just taking one day at a time and will deal with whatever it brings. I get my strength and positive spirit from God. He deserves all the praise and glory! My husband is the absolute best, he goes to all Dr apps, anything associated with my situation, sees to my every need. I could not ask for a better caregiver. He is my soulmate. My family and friends are very supportive and this makes a huge difference, I am truly blessed. Hope everyone has a fabulous weekend and Mothers Day! Life is Good.   ",

I think that is the norm with this group. But I am truly blessed that my stepson is an Oncologist! He can't technically treat me, but he set me up with a dr in his group, she is wonderful, and so is he, of course my stepson had input on any decisions made, so I just call him instead of her if I have questions and she is fine with that!

I really will be bouncing off the walls after all the steroids tomorrow, but I guess that's a good thing, because a quick visit from my sister and brother, this Thur and Fri, who live in different states, is fast turning into a family reunion!!!

My situation: I am 63 yrs old, have always been healthy as a horse, had my yearly mammogram in Feb and BAM...went for follow-up, and US, radiologist came in looked at screen, said he needed to do a biopsy, did it, and I left knowing I had cancer. I worked in US for 14 years so I knew what it looked like on screen. Got my results a week later and it was positive. I am blessed to have a stepson who is an oncologist. He got me in with a surgeon the next day. We scheduled a lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy in 5 days. Had lumpectomy, the sentinel node was positive for cancer so he removed all the soft tissue under my arm. He also removed a couple of other suspicious looking areas in breast. Path report showed the tumor margins clear, one of 10 nodes removed positive, the suspicious areas turned out to be DCIS. I have HER2 and all my hormone receptors were positive. We decided to do chemo first, then do bilateral mastectomy, while remaining on Herceptin for a year then probably Femara for five years I had a PET Scan the next week and it showed no signs of cancer in bone or liver, but the internal mammary lymph node appeared to be lit up. So because of that my treatment plan was changed to add Perjeta. I have my first of six treatments of TPH on April 28th, two days from now, and will receive them at 3 wk intervals. I am very anxious, I think the anticipation, not knowing how my body will react, is the hardest thing for me right now. It's really scary to me to think about having \"poison\" injected in my body that could potentially damage my healthy organs!!! ...after chemo I will have another PET Scan to look at that IM node. It's possible I may have to have radiation, depending on what PET Scan shows at that time. God has blessed me with a happy, always positive, personality that is sometimes annoying to certain people. I have been asked many times in my life (sometimes begrudgingly) \"how can you be so happy all the time\" ? I have come to realize that it is a gift from God. My hope is that I can hang on to this positivity throughout this Cancer Journey. I am hoping that since I have always been so healthy otherwise that it will help me through the potential side effects??? Any input on that??? My Oncologist is a female and I love her! I told her up front that I wanted to know everything, no soft peddling, I can deal with facts. She answered all my \"girly\" questions without my even having to ask! She told me my hair is going to come out after the 2nd treatment, and wrote a prescription for a hair prosthesis and told me where to go to get the best custom wig, and to go there when I left her office, order it, so it would be ready when I need it. I have ordered it and will pick it up tomorrow. She was very thorough and informative and wrote prescriptions for nausea, sleep, etc. I have already talked to my hair dresser and set up a date to shave my head. I refuse to watch my hair fall out! I am already a hat girl, so I have plenty of hats, and I am trying to get creative with scarf tying. I have a wonderful husband who is very supportive, and I am blessed to be retired. I know that God is with me and he will see me through this. When I look back over my life, I think he has been preparing me for this diagnosis for a very long time. Sorry for being so long winded... I look forward to being a part of this group...learning, helping each other...together we can do this! I can see the light at the end of the tunnel...",

I still have all the \"pound puppies and kitties\" from when my girls were little, I went and pulled out a pound kitty that looks like my cat \"MR Kitty\" and it works purrfectly (sorry : ))) ) I have had no issues with my power port at all so far, put in a week ago today, it's healing nicely and hasn't interfered with my sleep. This is day 13 post 1/6, I still have had no side effects at all. I feel great, perfectly normal, my energy level is still up, I feel great! I thank the lord for every day that I feel good, because I don't know if this will last. God never promised that life would be easy, just that he would be with us and help us through when it's not. I did keep ice chips in my mouth throughout the chemo, except when I had the reaction to Taxotere of course. One day I did have a sore on my tounge like what we always called a \"lie bump\" when I was a kid, but it was gone the next day. Don't know if it was related to chemo or just random. My oncologist put me on Valacyclovir daily because I have a place that breaks out on my hip (a type of herpes) when I am stressed. She said I didn't need to have to deal with it possibly breaking out while taking chemo, this could be helping keep away any mouth sores??? She also gave me Temazepam to take at night because she said a good nights sleep would be very important. I am a person who doesn't take anything unless it's absolutely necessary and I didn't want to take the sleeping pill... but it works, so I do, I sleep like a baby every night and wake up feeling great! She also did not start me out with the Neulasta shot, she wanted to wait and see if I would need it. My wig is in, I have an appt Thursday to get it cut into the style I want and the first fitting. The wig chick said until my hair was completly gone it would't fit right, that she would need to wait and do the final fitting around my ears then. My hair is not falling out, but more hair than usual comes out when I comb through it every day. Can't even imagine what I will look like bald!!! It won't be a pretty site...but I might enjoy not having to wash and dry my hair every day, once I get used to it! I have always envied men who look good bald, low maintenance! LOL Thank God I am already a hat girl, I have tons of hats, so no one will think anything about seeing me wearing one, it's already the norm.

I've been on Perjeta, Herceptin, and Anastrozole (added in Nov) since last August and have travelled around this country and Canada, been on 3 cruises, without any problems. My last Pet Scan showed some progression, so hence the Kadcyla. Have any of you been out of the country while taking this? I also have a trip planned next week to Gatlinburg for several days. My oncologist has always encouraged me to travel as much as possible, as long as I feel like it...I haven't let it slow me down yet! Reading how well some of you have done with this is very encouraging, I'm just kinda freaking out not knowing how I will react to this new drug! I had a reaction to Taxotere with my initial round of chemo, but was able to tolerate it with double steroids and pre-meds. The potential liver problems with this new drug have me the most worried, and the potential heart damage too of course, but I already get echocardiograms done on a regular basis, so far so good with that. Thanks so much for letting me vent my worries and frustrations, I'll let you know how I do with it.

You have a right to a copy of everything you have had done, reports, films, treatments etc. my Drs give them to me without having to ask, but if not, ASK! Take them to another oncologist and get a second opinion. Your life could depend on it! HER2 is a very aggressive cancer! You CAN be walking around with stage IV cancer and not know it! I have two friends who have died recently, both pictures of health!!! One went to the Dr thinking he had IBS because he had eaten some popcorn...he had stage IV pancreatic cancer and was dead 3 wks later! The other had been having constipation problems and went to Dr she had stage IV colon cancer that had spread to liver, lungs, pancreas, she died two months later! I hate to be so blunt and morbid...but this is a serious matter! I have another friend who was a picture of health, never been sick in her life! She was having stomach problems, went to Dr, she had a huge tumor in her abdomen that had attached to almost every organ in her body! They removed it and part of all of the organs it was attached to, she lives with a colostomy, now, and will take chemo the rest of her life, but she is doing great, looks great, they travel everywhere! That was 4 years ago! She is 58 now! I'm telling you all of this hoping you will get a second or even third opinion if that is what it takes. most people who take chemo or radiation feel much worse than before they were diagnosed, I think it's pretty much the norm! But it can prolong your life, time left on this earth to enjoy your family and friends. My theme from day one has been: \"I can see the light at the end of the tunnel\" I was so aggravated when they said I had to take chemo...I didn't want to have poison injected into my body that could damage my healthy cells...I have never been sick, I too am a picture of health! But I am a believer in God, and I truly believe that God is with me and he will see me through this. I have come to look at chemo as my ally, not my enemy. This will pass and I will be healthy again, I just have to go through some tough times to get there! Stand up for your rights, ask questions, demand explanations if necessary, pray and ask God to give you the strength and courage to get through this. this is YOUR life! Sending prayers up for you!",

This is a totally new feeling for me, I have always had tons of energy. Any suggestions on dealing with this? Would vitamin B shots help? Also, I have a few other questions... I am now having some joint and muscle pain, the bicep muscle in my dominate arm is very sore and tender to touch, has anyone else experienced this? I practically live outside in the sun and I do use sunscreen, but I have developed an itchy place on my arm, not really a rash, just itchy! I've been using cortisone cream, it helps but doesn't stop the itching...Any suggestions?

I do think the biopsy of R hilar lymph node changed my options...but I'm glad they did it. As my local oncologist, Specialist at MDA, and my breast surgeon all said...BMX and Rads would not change my situation...I would still have cancer, so why put myself through all of that. I trust them, and they believe they can manage it with chemo. So we will see. Congrats on your hair growth, you obviously have good hair for it to grow to the length you said it was! I hope you realize how fortunate you are! I find it so interesting that your hair changes from blonde to gray according to your nutrition! I've never heard of that... will have to google it when I get time!  Shutterbug - Sounds like your are another one blessed with good hair! Mine has always been fine and thin, and I couldn't stand it... but I would love to have my pitiful little hair back, I will never complain about it again! I never lost my nails either, but they were pretty sad looking by the end of Taxotere! They were very brittle and turning brown, but never lifted. I do take Biotin and Selenium and had for years before DX but while on the harsh stuff, Dr told me not to take any supplements, other than Centrum silver. I am back taking them now, and getting my nails done again. I had been getting solar nails for years and I missed them terribly while on the harsh stuff! Now I can throw on a blonde wig or hat (or both), my red lipstick, and with my toes and nails done, I feel like ME again!  sueopp - You are so right for reminding me that Perjeta and Herceptin don't rob us of our hair! That alone is a lot to be thankful for! I have adapted pretty well, but I do worry when I look in the mirror and see that it hasn't grown much...just wanted to know if anyone else had the same issue. I like your reference to this as \"Adventures in Cancer Land\"! LOL and Yes, we must keep on dancing! One of my motto's before all of this was \"I'm not going to let anything rain on MY parade\"...and that still stands...not even cancer! I haven't let it slow me down yet!  ccristee - Sounds like we are in the same boat...glad to know I'm not alone. I read an article yesterday about of all things, \"Castor Oil\" being good for re-growing hair after hair loss! I had always heard about taking it to clean out \"the other end\"!!! So, I hopped in my car and went to the local Dollar General and bought a bottle! The article said to massage a few drops into your scalp daily. Hey, I will try most anything once I massaged it in last night, it IS pretty oily, so I put a towel over my pillow... we will see what happens in the coming weeks! I have been a hat girl for about 20 years and I already had tons of them, so it comes natural for me to wear them! God knew I would need them one day, He truly is amazing! Just buy you some cute ones (if you don\"t already have some) and make a fashion statement! The little fedora's and floppy hats are actually in right now!  Praying that the future holds only good things for all of us, and thanks again for your replies, I feel better to know I'm not the only one! ",

My husband BG is full of mischief, so he and another gentleman sitting close by got Mr Peebles wound up, the whole waiting room was rolling in the floor laughing. A little later when Bobby was going to get ice chips for me, he ran into the other gentleman who said hey! Come to my car I have something for you...he handed him a handmade doll with a note pinned to it's hand. He said give the one with green hair to your wife and here is one for you too, it was a \"Dammit Doll\"üòÇüòÇüòÇ I will try to attach a picture that will explain.

I was diagnosed in March, 2015 as stage II grade 3 ER+PR+HER2+ breast cancer, I ¬†had a lumpectomy and axillary lymph node removal and surgeon found DCIS also. Pet scan showed an internal mammory node lit up and a suspicious area in right Hilar region but they thought it was inflammation, and thought if it was anything the chemo would take care of it. Well, after chemo, the follow-up Pet scan showed IM node and RH node still slightly lit up. So I was told the next step was mastectomy, then radiation. My stepson is an oncologists and he pushed for me to have an EBUS Bronc of the node in R hilar region just to see if it was cancer. The Dr who was to do it didn't want to attempt it because it was so small and in a hard to reach area, he said there was only a 20% chance he could even get to it. But thank the Lord he was able to reach it and obtained a biopsy that showed breast cancer cells. So that changed everything! I am now stage IV, incurable... no mastectomy, no radiation.¬† I then went to MD Anderson (My stepson's suggestion) and they are telling me they hope to manage this like any others chronic illness, such as diabetes!

I just thought it would grow faster than that??? and it came back exactly like it was before...fine and thin, and same color. I have kept it blonde for the last 40 years (I am 64 now).
