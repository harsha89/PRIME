I was diagnosed with GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) some years back and have had panic attacks off and on since I was 16 (I'm 42 now). My anxiety is definitely up right now as I'm awaiting results from a stereotactic biopsy I had done yesterday. I was glad I did think to take lorazepam (generic Ativan) before my appointment yesterday as that definitely helped. I agree that mindfulness and doing meditation do really help, for me it helps \"reset\" me by forcing me to take a break from all that I'm worrying about. Reading a book or playing a musical instrument can do that for me, too, as it forces much of your cognitive attention to fixate on something other than the worry/worries. Thanks to all for sharing their experiences and tips when it comes to dealing with anxiety, I know it's often not easy to talk about! Also, thanks to for posting the article. I'm always curious to learn more about what parts of the brain are involved in anxiety, etc.",

I don't have a surgery date set yet--I ended up having to reschedule my doctor appointment yesterday--but that turned out to be okay as I'll now be meeting with a doctor that I've heard is an improvement of who I HAD been scheduled to meet with. This whole process for me has been a bit of a clusterf**k, as paper copies of test results weren't mailed to me when I was told they would be, my case was left \"open\" as while I was on a 2.5 week vacation it had been decided I should have an MRI before meeting with the surgeon but nobody communicated this to me, I wasn't called with my MRI results yesterday when I was told I would be because the NP's computer crashed and apparently that's the only way they can track what's going on, etc. I've had to make a LOT of phone calls. The most ridiculous one is the fact that I only learned I'd need an MRI after I'd called the clinic when I hadn't received test results back. Even though I was on vacation, there was no attempt made to contact me about needing additional diagnostics. Even a simple voicemail telling me to call them would have sufficed, as I was on the East coast and I did have my phone and calendar with me. Very frustrating! Where I go because my situation isn't dire, I fall into the category of receiving a very piecemeal approach to dealing with patients. The only good thing about the clinic messing up so much is I now will be working with an actual nurse who can help coordinate my care and do a MUCH better job of keeping me informed and explaining what the process is. All that aside--thanks for sharing your experience and thoughts! I was thinking the same about the MRI and that a more definitive answer will come from the excisional biopsy. Keep your fingers crossed for me!",

Even though it was posted 6 years ago, it still gave me comfort to read this and to know I'm not alone in what I'm feeling right now. My story is I had a stereotactic biopsy back in early August 2017 after going in about a lump in my right breast. The lump turned out to just be a cyst, but they saw architectural distortion in my left breast and had me schedule first an ultrasound-guided biopsy (didn't really work) and then a stereotactic biopsy. They found ADH, CCC (Columnar Cell Change), radial scar/complex sclerosing lesion. My partner and I had already planned a 2.5 week vacation long before any of this happened so I was able to put this out of my mind while we were gone but now that I'm back, my stress has come back ten-fold. I'm scheduled to have a breast MRI this coming Monday and then will meet with the doctor on Wednesday to go over the MRI results. It's really scaring me that I have no idea what they'll find for sure and I'm worried they'll find DCIS or possibly even ICD. I know I'll feel better come Wednesday when I'll be called with the MRI results before going in to see the doctor. In the meantime, I feel like I'm having to put my life on hold and ti's really stressful!",

Now the next step will be for me to have an excisional biopsy of the area with ADH and columnar cell atypia. I have an appointment with the doctor next week to talk about this and then schedule the surgery. From what I've read, it sounds like there's only a very, very,slim slim chance that they could possibly find any DCIS after they take out the ADH area because the MRI is a MUCH more sensitive test than mammography. I'm going with the 'they likely won't find anything' thought for now, but has anybody had an MRI show no DCIS but after the excisional biopsy, some DCIS was found, and/or is this possible? Also, I don't know if there's a threshold of size for DCIS where it would need to be a certain size for an MRI to detect it. Just want to be aware of ANY or ALL possibilities, and it's not that I think that a slim chance would turn out to be my situation. I'm not that special. ",

      "Content": "Sep 22, 2017 03:35PM - edited Sep 22, 2017 03:36PM by gwen4444 Hi everyone! I have an update--I met with the breast surgeon Tuesday of this week and she's GREAT. While what all happened at the breast center clinic really frustrated me, the fact that one of the most important people in this whole process is really good definitely relieved some of my stress! That's thanks in no small part to the nurse at the breast center clinic who stepped forward to help me and who got me the appointment with her. I'm scheduled for an excisional biopsy on October 26. I'm okay with the date being further out as there are some events and other happenings coming up that I wanted to not be sore/recovering during. Plus more time gives me an opportunity to take care of some of what I've had to put on hold while waiting to see what the plan would be. The surgeon told me she's not expecting to see any cancer or DCIS, but as ADH is a marker for it and could be hiding it, they want to biopsy it to be sure for peace of mind. I'm in full agreement with that! One thing I wasn't expecting--I had been thinking from what I'd read that I'd have a wire-guided excisional biopsy but they'll be using a radioactive seed instead. I'm okay with that, sounds much better than having a wire poking out of my breast! I'll get the seed put in the afternoon before at the breast center clinic, with surgery at the hospital the following morning. Another thing I'm happy about is I only have to go back to the breast center clinic one more time at least for now, to have the seed put in. I was able to make my follow-up appointment at the clinic right next to the hospital. I had my appointment with the surgeon at that same location and everybody was REALLY nice, even the receptionists/check-in people seemed more low-key. Having been a receptionist myself, that can say a lot about the general atmosphere of a place. Anyway, it feels GREAT to FINALLY have a plan in place. The plan post-biopsy is still up in the air, of course, but I'll see what that is when we get there.",

Not knowing what the future holds may make you fearful for your health. With time, every woman develops her own way of coping with atypical hyperplasia and her increased risk of breast cancer. Until you find your way of coping, consider trying to: Understand your individual risk of breast cancer. Breast cancer risk statistics can be overwhelming and frightening. Breast cancer risk statistics are developed by following thousands of women and can give you an idea of your prognosis, but the statistics can't tell you about your own risk of breast cancer. Ask your doctor to explain your individual risk of breast cancer. Once you understand your personal risk of breast cancer, you can feel more comfortable making decisions about your treatment. Go to all of your follow-up appointments. If you've been diagnosed with atypical hyperplasia, your doctor may recommend more frequent breast cancer screening exams and tests. You may find yourself distracted with worry before each exam because you're afraid that your doctor will find breast cancer. Don't let your fear stop you from going to your appointments. Instead, accept that fear is normal and find ways to cope. Relax, write your feelings in a journal or spend time with a close friend who can lift your spirits. Maintain your health. Make healthy lifestyle choices to keep yourself healthy. For instance, maintain a healthy weight, eat a healthy diet full of fruits and vegetables, get enough sleep so that you wake feeling rested, and limit the amount of alcohol you drink, if you choose to drink alcohol. You can't control whether or not you get breast cancer, but you can keep healthy so that you're well enough for breast cancer treatment, should you need it. Talk with other women in your situation. Talk to other women who have been diagnosed with atypical hyperplasia. Ask your doctor about support groups in your community. Another option is online message boards. Breast cancer organizations, such as, offer message boards for women with a high risk of breast cancer to connect with each other.\" ------ Me again--I've been reading through all the posts on here and everyone's posts have been REALLY helpful. I have GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) so I'm already hard-wired to worry about things. I usually do better in situations where there's actually something real to worry about, but because I'm in limbo-land for now as I won't have the MRI until next week, I've got the \"best of both worlds,\" in that I'm worrying both about what I know is true and also about the unknown. Sigh. So glad this thread exists!!",
