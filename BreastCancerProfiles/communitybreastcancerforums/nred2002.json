They adjusted these (I also get the lowest possible dose of decadron) and by also being proactive with Colace and Smooth Move tea (I start these the day before the infusion and take day of and after), things are going much better. My first infusion nurse also gave me her \"three w's\" --water, walking and washing--and these have also helped. I have had only minimal side effects so far (begin Cycle 4 this Thursday). My blood counts took a hit the first couple of doses, but seem to have bounced back--on the low end of normal, but still normal.
