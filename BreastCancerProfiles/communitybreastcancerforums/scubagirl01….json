I want to send holiday greetings and thanks to each of you on this very special Christmas day. I will have a bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction on January 11th and I will post more about my journeyiin a few days after my son, who is dealing with his own cancer diagnosis, returns to his home. I hope you all are surrounded by supportive family and friends at this time. Peace to all! ",
