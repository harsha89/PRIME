Here, we report the case of a 23-year-old woman who presented with a palpable mass in the right breast. The mass had persisted for 4 years and had been causing pain for 1 month at the time of the patient's presentation. We examined the mass by means of mammography and sonography. Sonographic examination revealed a well-circumscribed solid, avascular mass suggestive of an epidermal inclusion cyst. Excision was performed at the patient's request. Histopathologic examination of the mass after excision confirmed the diagnosis of epidermal inclusion cyst and its localization within the breast parenchyma. To our knowledge, reports on epidermal inclusion cysts within the breast parenchyma are rare.",

C - good luck to you, too! I wonder what the surgeon will do tomorrow night.  I am going to him on good recommendations even though he does not participate in my insurance plan.  If worse comes to worse and I need further treatments that will be expensive, I will have to reevaluate.  I have not had an MRI yet.  I was looking through my old medical records from my retired ob-gyn and cannot believe that I FORGOT that I had a lump I felt once before but no one else felt.  It is the same lump in the 2 o'clock position on the left breast!!!  Now, however, everyone can feel it and there is a dimple on the skin - I'm very scared that it is the same one - has been there since 1995 - and was ignored by previous bs. ",

Oh, and as to the Lane Bryant wired bras - I hear you, sister!  I had awful soreness from that (I'm only a 42D) so now I buy their wireless ones and they are pretty good at holding things up! :-)",

Best of luck to you.",
