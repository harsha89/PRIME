    "Content": "mommy2 wrote: I had an MRI 6 months ago for a suspicious spot on my right breast.  The MRI did not see the same spot that the ultrasound showed.  However, it did show something on my left breast. 6mmX10mm. Slight enhancement Classification-0  Repeat MRI in 6 months. Last week, I went back for my 6 month follow-up and had an ultrasound.  The doctor told me that there were changes and I needed a Mammtone biopsy.He said that we need to be aggressive. (My sister was just diagnosed with Stage 4 9 months ago)  He does not do these biopsies but another dr in the practice would do it.  Today, I went in for my biopsy and the techs had a hard time finding the Nodule.  They called in the radiologist.  He did the ultrasound then called in the dr too. They told me that it may actually be 3 ducts coming together.  According to him,the radiologist was able to dice and slice the MRI- Something techs don't do.He had thought that I already had my 6 month follow-up MRI.  He thinks it may be benign but does not want to do a biopsy until I have an MRI.  He said if I have the biopsy,they cannot do another MRI for a year.  They gave me all my records to bring to my MRI appt.  When I got home, I looked them over. My my last Ultrasound report said::  Bi Rad- 4 Most probable Malignancy.  I'm so confused and of course upset. I don't know what to think.  My MRI is not scheudled until Monday. One week Malignant the next week maybe benign?  Anyone else have anything similar happen to them? Log in to post a reply",
