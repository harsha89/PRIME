It helps to have ppl like you who are willing to share and answer my many questions. I'm learning so much about cancer....  maybe too much.  I need to avoid reading on the internet about ppl who had cancer and sadly lost their fight.  I kept crying and not able to sleep. (I'm still recovering from my mastectomy I had Oct. 5th.)",

Also, can I still drive while receiving chemo treatments or do I need to wait until my treatments are done? Sorry for asking a lot of dumb questions.",

I'm scheduled to receive Doxorubicin or \"Red Devil\" and Cyclophosphamide (cytoxan or neosar).  I've been so scared after reading the side effects of both drugs - dizziness, blurred vision (is it from tears?), vomiting, nausea, cardiac side effects, etc.  Does the side effect remain throughout the chemo treatment or does it go away after a couple of days?  If any of you experienced dizziness, did you do anything to stablize the dizziness or did it go away?  If you have any helpful information, I'll appreciate it.  Thank you!
