I think it is the fact that we are in there with the machines, even though they monitor us it is a bit more solo. i find now that there is a routine I am much more relaxed, just now starting to get some redness, they gave me a script for a cream called xclair. What potions have you found handy?",

They gave me a cream called Xclair, it was very soothing. I also had to take pain meds, it took about a week after they quit rediating that area and then I started to notice my skin to calm down. It is very painful and I went into chemo mode, minimized what I did around the house, got help whereever I could, just for those couple of days. I hope this note finds you celebrating the end of rads!",
