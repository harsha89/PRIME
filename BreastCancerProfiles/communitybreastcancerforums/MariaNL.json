I asked the onc about the tingling, she told me it is a se of taxol and to start taking B6. I am to let them know if that does not help when I go Weds. and then they may adjust my dose. I've been taking it for 4 days now with no change. MY DH had his shoulder surgery this Thursday, they removed a good size bone spur, he is healing nicely some pain but handling it well. My DD is healing well from her surgery. It feels like all I do anymore is travel the Denver metro area from one doctor to the next. Hopefully this time next year we will all be healed and healthy. We went to see Cirque Du Soleil on Wed. night what an amazing show, if any one ever gets the chance go and see one of their productions, they never disapoint.

He loves performing and it is his true passion. We had quite the weather here today, they had to plow some neighborhoods because of all the hail. Weird for September.

Jo6202 is right you will be stronger and so will your bond with your kids. My 21 year old daughter asked the other day what she needs to do to change her last name to my maiden name. They grow up and realize what you did by yourself for them and the bond is unbreakable, I used to say my ex would be sorry one day for not being there but that doesn't mean anything anymore because I know I have something with my kids he will never get to know. The last couple of days have not been fun. First my husband was told they will be closing down his dept at work and moving it to Tennessee, and there is no way we would move there. So stressed about insurance, can't be without it right now. Went to my RO today, thought I was just having a consultation but they did my simulation as well. I was very emotional all day, so tired of being poked, prodded and scanned. I will be having 33 sessions starting October 29th. He was pretty sure that he does not want me to have any surgery before rads, I asked him to get with my PS to see exactly why he feels the need to start before. Nihahi, love your beautiful pictures.

Traii so glad you are healing well Benny love that you are rescuing the chicken, just don't go and get yourself arrested. Movie I'm having a tooth issue as well, not painfully yet but feels weird. Will they let me see a dentist while in Chemo? So yesterday my DD had her shoulder surgery, it went well there was more damage then he thought but looks like in 6 months she will be good to go. So while I'm waiting for her to get out of surgery my DH calls and is really dizzy and sick at work, I can't leave my DD so work calls the ambulance and they bring him to the same hospital I'm at, lucky for us it was the closest to his work. Talk about a stressed out day I'm going between the 2 departments like a mad woman. Looks like DH has vertigo they gave him some meds hopefully it will take care of it. He went to his PC today and she thinks the same. Needless to say I'm ready for the weekend, DH and I are headed to the hills for a couple days. I hope everyone has an lovely weekend",

Try not to add to it by getting online, turn here and other threads for help. I didn't have a choice of which to have, on my right side but did have a choice to have them take the left as well. I chose not to have both taken. It was what I felt in my heart was right for me. Take a deep breath and search within. As the other ladies said keep big pockets available for us. Liefie, so glad you had a good trip and made it home finally. I love SF such a cool place to visit and great places to eat. Dakota, I hope you are doing ok, you have been awfully quiet. My friends daughter is still in the hospital, her stomach started to bleed so they had her in icu. She is doing better today. The sun finally came out today, so hopefully rebuilding can begin. Over 1000 houses destroyed and 1700 damaged. Hundreds of roads and bridges torn apart. Still over 200 people unaccounted for. From rain it's mind boggling. I hope everyone is getting along well.",

I'm not enjoying it at all, my skin is broken out with small blisters and it itches so bad. I also feel tired all the time yuck. I just want it all to be over. Sorry to be a downer but I'm having a hard time feeling upbeat lately.  A couple days after Carla passed a good friend of mine passed from bladder cancer, he found out the same time I was dx. I think it really woke me up to the fact that it can come back or never go away. This terrifies me for all of us. I think of you all, all the time and hope you all are staying strong",
