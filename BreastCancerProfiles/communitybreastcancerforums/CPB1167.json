My MO said that is not the number she hoped for, and that chemo is the appropriate treatment. I have an appt with her tomorrow to discuss, I really like her and feel that I am in good hands in regards to whatever she feels is the best course of treatment. I feel kind of numb I guess, I knew chemo was a possibility but now that it has been given, my brain is swirling. I guess I keep thinking, they removed the breast, I had no node involvement and clear margins do I really need chemo? Cant I just take Tamoxifen or something like that? I believe she said I would do 4 rounds of TC. I think she said with only taking Tamoxifen I have an 18% of recurrence. I am 51 yrs old. I'm sure after I talk to my MO tomorrow I will feel more confident that the chemo is the right course, but I just wonder how many people choose not to do chemo against what their doctor's say..? I will let you know after my appt if I will be joining you on this September thread. Thanks for letting me get this out.",

I feel so vain talking about this part of my cancer journey - I am healthy should be my main focus....I have always gotten blonde highlights and whenever I look in the mirror now I don\u2019t know this person staring back at me. I\u2019m 51, and trying to embrace my gray....not working so well. The texture is so different, someone described their hair as \u201cthe pelt of a dead rodent\u201d, thats pretty much how I feel. My oncologist said to wait 6 mos before coloring and to use vegetable dye. I cannot find anything like this. I have seenthe Naturetint brand and am curious if anyone used this brand and is it really vegetable based? Thanks.",

I dont think any of this seems real at this point, maybe I am still in shock as I have had clear mammograms every year including last September having the u/s mammo. I have a consult with a breast surgeon on Monday, I'm just curious what questions I may be asked, what info I need to bring, in general what happens at the appointment.

There are 2 masses so the surgeon recommends mastectomy which I am in full agreement of. I feel very confident with my doctor, I know I will be in good hands with him. I had genetics testing yesterday and an MRI today to verify no cancer in right breast so anxiously awaiting those results. Next week I have a consult with reconstructive surgeon - I am trying to familiarize myself with reconstructive options at this point. I'm just going day by day, appt to appt....deep breaths.....",
