Since there was no rash I just ignored it. Eventually it went away. Soon after though, the same breast began to hurt. At first, it hurt all over, but now its just one area. It feels somewhat like a bruise, but no change in appearance. It wasn't until I noticed brown discharge while changing clothes that I began to worry. I was able to express more out. I only did that once because it freaked me out. I also have small lump or something at the top of the breast. My gyn sent me to get a mammogram and ultrasound. The mammogram came back normal. The ultrasound came back with some findings. My doctor said we could just wait 6 months and check again since likely benign. The findings are: At the 9 to 10 o'clock position, 6cm from the nipple, there is a oval hypoechoic 5 x 4 mm heterogeneous solid appearing mass with central increased echoes potentially an intramammary lymph node. At the 9 to 10 o'clock position also 6 cm from the nipple there is a cystic 8 x 4 mm and an adjacent 8 mm circumscribed solid appearing mass with internal heterogeneous signal but no vascularity. These masses are most likely benign but will need follow-up. I'm wondering if I should push for further testing. I'm worried. Log in to post a reply",
