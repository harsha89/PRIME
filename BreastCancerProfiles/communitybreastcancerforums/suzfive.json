I then took 1/4 of a tablet which took the edge off and I was able to function. After a while you may get used to the 1/4 and may need to go up to the 1/2 or take the 1/2 at night to help you sleep. I am glad you are getting some good drugs - panic attacks are no fun. I am so sorry that you need them - cancer sucks. Love and hugs, Suz",

She was originally diagnosed in 1965 and at that time they did not tell you anything other than you had bc. Her mets were not diagnosed until 1989 - long story. I was diagnosed in 2005. I immediately contacted the hospital where she was treated and was told they only keep medical records for 10 years. This was in Michigan - not sure if this is the case in all states. I have a file with all my pathology reports so that in the future if anyone else in the family is diagnosed and I am not around they will have that information. I did have the BRCA test and was negative. The death certificate might only list cause of death as metastatic cancer.",
