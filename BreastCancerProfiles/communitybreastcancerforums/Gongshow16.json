Every ache or pain has me thinking cancer!! I know I have to learn to live with it but it's not going to be easy. I'm finding it hard to make plans for the future- so used to making everything fit around surgery/chemo/ rad schedule ... Anybody have advice for me??

No two plans are exactly the same. There are so many variables that have to be taken into account it's mindboggling! Do what I did and at your next appointment and ask to have your treatment plan explained to you- ask to see it too. The changes in radiation treatment over the last 5-10 years really is amazing. Not long ago everyone just got the same type of treatment and hoped for the best. We have come such a long way in being more proactive and specific when treating this awful disease. Keep asking questions until you get the answers you need. Getting ready for my first full week of radiation! Anyone who's taking/ going to take tamoxifen : did you start while still doing radiation?

The Aloe is cold but really cools the skin. It goes on quite watery but you have to let it soak in for about 20 minutes. I put the glaxol on a little while after the aloe.  Good luck everyone.

I just did these while doing my crunches- 2 birds 1 stone!! My arm was stiff and heavy during rads- happened early on- but the stretches really helped and after a week or so of finishing- it's much better. Salty girl: you can do it!
