If anything I have learned to have things clearly wrote down or bring someone with me in the future.  The biopsy is at the breast clinic, not with a surgeon. The appointment on the 12th is to get the results and for a surgery consultation. The nurse at the clinic wrote surgery on the paperwork for the appointment for some reason. I am getting nervous- the nurse I talked to today couldn't figure out why I am going to the surgeon to get the results.  The radiologist notes just recommended it. She said it may have to do with the size and my family history of breast cancer. Then they called back because to reschedule the appointment for later in the day on the 12th because it was set before result would even be in. All the confusion on top of having to wait is awful. ",

They immediately had me do a ultrasound after my mammogram and said I have a growth in my left breast as well as a cyst in my right (they said the cyst was clearly liquid and was not concerning at all.) I am scheduled for a core biopsy on the 10th and have an appointment with a surgeon on the 12th to get results and for removal (I guess if it is benign.)  The doctor said he thought it was probably a fibroadenoma and listed off four other possibilities that i cannot remember, some benign and one cancerous . After the test and multiple technicians and then the doctor coming into the room to look at the ultrasound i was not able to focus on anything. I am just wondering should I be going to a surgeon to get my result and have surgery right away? I feel like I didn't ask any questions about it because I wasn't thinking straight. Also, I have been reading about different options for removal. Has anyone had any experience with cryoablation?   Log in to post a reply",

I wish I could say my experience went as well as yours. The doctor and techs were very helpful and nice but I still have pain if I raise my arm. They did place a marker when I had mine done. I am meeting with a surgeon to possibly have it frozen - cryoablation. I had to do some searching to find a surgeon in the area that does the procedure, but it seems to be a far better option than surgery to me. It is less invasive, about the same as the biopsy.  Might be something worth looking into if you need to have it removed in the future.",
