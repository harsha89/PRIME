They certainly sugar coat it at the doctors office (compared to some of the issues I read here). I realize everyone is different, but I would rather be prepared than blindsided. Any suggestions on what to do to get ready. I saw where someone put creams on week in advance to help hydrate breast area - sounds like a great idea to me. My sister made some 100% aloe cream from her gigantic plant - so I have this and the aquaphor the Doc suggested to use during tx. Also have goat milk soap and some sensitive skin Dove (suggested by Dr.). Hope everyone has a great day!",

My arm is having some issues and I have to wear my \"sleeve\" when I do exercises or it does swell a bit. I thought since only two lymph nodes were removed I wouldn't have any issues\u2026.but just being careful to pay attention. Keep up the good work! We will all be stronger inside and out after this :-) ",

Rads finished 12/31/14 and not too bad, skin looked good, a bit red, with dark skin under the arm and breast. Seemed to heal fine, skin went back to \"normal\" and ROM was good. Now my breast and underarm are very sore and ROM is decreased. There is pain without movement also. My skin also seems to be getting darker again - I can see the outline of radiation clearly (it was faded away)\u2026 Is there infection that can be caused by radiation??",
