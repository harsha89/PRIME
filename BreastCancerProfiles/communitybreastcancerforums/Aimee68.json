I had a PET scan( which lit up in that area), so they removed it and biopsied it. ( I guess it was the size of a ping-pong ball). The pathology report came back as benign reactive. They don't know why this occured. 4-6 weeks after the surgery, I started to develop some slight swelling and Orange peel-like skin on the same breast. It itches on occasion. I have had two breast surgeons/specialists tell me that this is a complication of the lymph node removal I am still VERY worried thaough.",

About 4-6 weeks later I developed slight swelling and orange peel like/enlarged pores on under side of breast and around areola. Â It is very itchy at times, and I have pain in armpit and breast. These symptoms have occurred intermittently over the past few months. I have had three breast surgeons tell me that it is breast lymphedema. I am not so sure.",
