We did MRI and petscan, and during massectomy did biopsy sentinel nodes. It all sounds reasonable (I should specify that husband is doctor so at home advice too...) we also did and you should do the DNA testing, which in my case was positive (BRAC2) because of that, although only left breast had cancer we did double mastectomy. We will also do ovarectomy and utersctomy (not sure how to spell) Take it one day at a time, each step brings you closer to recovery. I know easier said than done, but you are not alone. I found a lot of comfort reading other women's posts and answers. Take care.",
