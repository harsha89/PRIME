I wasnt super worried and I had an annual exam scheduled so I waited. That has been rescheduled and our lives a little disheveled so I forgot about it but now, I have an almost constant ache although sometimes it goes away. I know all of these symptoms could and likely are something benign. Now, however, despite not feeling a lump, the affected breast is a different size and shape. It\u2019s lower by about .75 inch and I still don\u2019t feel a lump. I could excuse everything else to probably something else. What else could a change in shape be? I\u2019m 38 and I go in for both a mammogram and doc visit on 11/3, but it\u2019s just my gyn. Log in to post a reply",
