I was searching on the same issue with my 11year old daughter, she has a swollen gland or something under her breast, she says that it hurts and it also becomes really reddish around the area. She has not yet begun puberty, could this be it? I have another daughter of 15 year old, her breasts developed well, but for the last year, the left side breast has not grown to near the other ones size? Should I be worried?",
