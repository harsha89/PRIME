I've set up an appt with a rheumatologist but I'm wondering if anyone else is experiencing this and what you might have tried. Glucosamine? Vitamins? Help :( Steiner, how are you doing?",

I am wondering a few things and hoping you ladies might have some advice for me -  I have very thin veins and although the nurses have been able to find a vein for iv they have now eliminated 2 veins for further infusions.  They are discussing a Picc Line and am wondering if anyone has one or has any thoughts? Also I feel not just dizzy during the day but sort of a heaviness in my head.  I did not have this feeling at all with round 1 and wonder if anyone else has had this side effect and what you all did about it?  I am sorry that so many of us are going through this.  I hope you are all feeling better from your treatments and side effects and enjoying a good day today.",

I take Claritin everyday for allergies so I'm not sure what it would have been like without it.  I would certainly encourage the Claritin as it can't hurt and it might help.  I am day 8 after round 2 and am finally feeling less of the chemo fog.  This was a tough week but I am remembering that the side effects are temporary and the cure is for a lifetime.  Stay positive ladies!  ",

And at 49, a wonderful husband and 3 children later, it's not about the beautiful boobs anymore... I had a very, very narrow clean margin after my mastectomy so the doctors felt radiation was in order for cleaning that up.  My sentinel node was also positive but I personally did not want to go through another surgery to remove additional nodes. There are risks involved in all that we do.   You've been through this before.  Talk with your doctors, ask all your questions, make sure you are comfortable with your decision.  It is a very personal decision in the end.

Just checking in and saw Bren58 post on bananas...I have been putting a banana in the blender with some frozen strawberries and Kefir (probiotic yogurt).  It makes a nice shake and takes out the texture.  Maybe you would enjoy this too. I had TC#3 on Friday.  The chemo fog set in quickly and that overall queasy feeling is back.  I am also waking up every 2 hours at night.  Any thoughts on how to get a better nights rest or is this just par for the course and sleep will return when chemo is done???  Being tired all of the time is terrible and makes working from home a bigger drag...",

Sandra60- that is interesting about your steroids.  That 1 should work as well as 2.  I think I will ask my MO about that as those steroids are rough.  They do keep us wired and restless at night and it would be awesome to be half as wired and half as restless if that's possible :) It sounds like everyone is doing really well for the most part and that is great news.  I agree that it has been a blessing to be able to share info and get info these past months as we pushed through the chemo protocol.   Wishing everyone continued restful days and nights.",

We do need to grieve and that is part of this journey, but then we need to move on and heal.  I agree we cannot always grieve with our family we sometimes need to grieve all alone.  I wonder if the steroids, chemo and lowered immunity has pushed us to a place where we are more down on ourselves and life then we would otherwise be.  I am definitely a half-full kind of lady but even I have had those very dark moments and it's scary. I have my last round (TC 4) next week...I am home today with a sick 11 year old and am doing my best to take care of him and disinfect everything he touches.  Need to stay healthy to stay on chemo schedule.  That is my mantra.

Like you Sandra, I had very minimal side effects from the rads. Nothing a little aquaphor, calendula, aloe and hydrocortisone couldn't handle :P  It surprised me though how the skin holds up for so long and then suddenly it becomes angry... Nicole,  I started Tamoxifen about 6 weeks ago and it is going well with minimal SE.  The first couple of weeks I experienced pain in my thighs (like I was tackled in a game of football from both sides) but that went away and other than hot flashes, no other SE's have appeared. I hope your experience is similar. I think about you gals often.  Sending everyone ((hugs)).",

I was a pilates lover and pretty fit before my diagnosis but I haven't worked out other than a yoga class here and there since October.   So that leaves walking and it was 26 degrees here yesterday, so that eliminated walking for the day...   Let's stay focused on losing the cancer and then losing the weight.  One thing at a time, right?  I am told that rads are not as tough on the body so maybe I will be able to workout more once chemo is finished and the weather is warmer.   I am very excited that my last TC is this Friday - Woo hoo!!!  and I am hopeful that the SE's aren't too bad.  It would be nice to finish strong.   I hope you all are well and your SE's are treating you well today.",

For the chest area I really like Calendula Cream (by California Baby)  during the day (not at all greasy) and Aquaphor at night (very greasy) but works really well.  The hair thing, yeah, that truly stinks. The weather is getting warmer and my hair is growing in really slowly too.  I am super bummed about that.   I was hoping for my 50th birthday in July to have a cute Halle Berry haircut :(   Wow, this was a long post.  Wishing you all a great day today.  ",
