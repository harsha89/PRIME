I do think it is unprofessional that my surgeon knew 9 years ago what it was, but the rads doc didn't. It contributes to my lack of confidence in crisis specialists, because they tend to only deal with the patient situation at the time of treatment, which is why so often they are in denial about anything and everything else at the time they sit on the tumor board to make such limited recommendations in the blind. I still don't have a clear understanding of how rads works in terms of why the rads necrosis so gradually spreads (and probably will continue to spread for me). Or why it only affected the lower half, unless the lower half had a different circulation than the upper half. Another experience that was interesting to me was when, as part of my personal preference for increasing my vitamin D, I spent as much time without much clothing on in whatever Alaskan sunshine I could get right from the time of diagnosis, including sunlight on bare breasts. One day I looked down at the lumpectomy breast and was amazed to see a distinct pattern on the breast of red spots in scattered shapes in a circular pattern. I realized (from having seen numeruos patient mammograms over time) that what I was seeing was the surgical clips. The red skin spots faded pretty quickly. The next time I saw my surgeon and we went over my mammogram, I saw the identical pattern of clips. So I told him what I'd seen. He didn't accept it, but I have no doubt about what it was myself.

      "Content": "Mar 1, 2012 12:36PM - edited Mar 1, 2012 12:39PM by AlaskaAngel Thanks, Spinnerpom. That is exceptionally well-written and empathic! I've been curious about a problem from my rads experience, with a question that wasn't discussed in the article and that is probably not all that common. I had IMRT rads to the left lumpectomy breast in 2002 with boost. Eventually the lower 1/6 of the breast turned hard and painful to touch, even though there is nothing to \"see\" that is different (because unlike what we consider \"burns\", rads works differently and exposes the tissue under the skin to treatment). Over time the area that was painful and hard spread upward as well. It is called \"radiation necrosis\" (basically, as gross as this sounds, melted fat, leaving hard tissue behind). My understanding is/was that the action of the rads exposure is not static and that it continued to \"expose\" over time, but that idea conflicts with what was said in the OP above. I'm not really sure. All I know is that the hardened painful portion of the breast went from being just the very bottom half over the years to being the entire bottom half over the years. It makes it difficult to tell whether or not there is any recurrence, in comparison to whatever is hardening the lower breast and making it so painful to the touch. A year after I completed treatment I spent the money to travel back in the Lower 48 to the radiology center where I had been treated, to be seen by the radiologist who had prescribed my treatment originally. It just happens that person was also the chief of the brand new rads center at the time I had been treated. The radiologist told me it was unknown what the hardened area was, and preferred to recommend an MRI. The rads doc admitted to being less familiar with reading ultrasounds personally, which was fine by me. But my breast surgeon was located 2 states distant in Seattle. So by my request, the rads doc ordered the MRI to be done in Seattle for my surgeon to review. I traveled to Seattle. My surgeon told me that he suspected it was \"radiation necrosis\". The MRI was done, and an accumulation of fluid indicated he was correct. The accumulated fluid was fatty fluid (oil). The MRI results were provided to my rads doc. I do not know why it happened, nor do I understand at all why my rads doc didn't mention what it might be. I have no solution for it. My surgeon drained the accumulated fluid. It is still painful. As a final note, I did and do think my rads doc was a caring person with good intentions. I remain puzzled by it all, however. AlaskaAngel",

Yet I also think that cancer centers are only slowly starting to spend any resources on those who are fortunate enough to last after going through it, but have issues due to the treatment. Thanks,Outfield, for additional insight into my question. I want you to know I didn't miss your response. I just want to provide some perspective to those who are wondering what happens as more time goes by..... the stuff that rads docs don't talk about, and don't seem to know. I agree that it takes lots of time to heal.... \"healing from what is a massive radiation injury can take quite a long time too.  There are all sorts of structural changes as a result of those reactive chemicals, and recovery from those can go on for 12-18 months.  Sometimes in that process of healing, things end up seeming worse than at the time of the injury.  Tissues stiffen.  Inflammatory cells turn dead material into liquid.\" .... BUT.... I am ten years out now and the spread of the hardening of the breast and painful area is continuing. In my own situation it has resulted in tightening that is pulling on the arm and shoulder, and even though I only had one benign sentinel node removed at surgery, and I did PT to keep frozen shoulder from being complete, my left arm clear down to the hand is having problems. I honestly don't know if this is common. But I also think long-term survivors do have issues from rads that are ongoing. So.... I'm reluctant to assure anyone that they aren't common, either.  Because of the damage, In the past year I finally have had to give up my only source of income that is based on being able to use that arm. I went from being full-time to part-time to get by with it, and now can't continue. I think in this discussion there still is not a clear answer as to just what rads does or how it works, because I would have expected it to heal at some point and stop advancing, and not continue to have more effects. I don't hear the answer to that in our discussion. P.S. A side note - I had Adriamycin and Cytoxan with 5-FU at age 51 and have a fairly good EF (I do take CoQ10), and my bc was left-sided, for those with heart concern questions to consider. A.A.",

Cancer cells are just cells that are abnormal and all humans have some of them at any given time. The immune system either works to keep them from taking over, or not. Some of us have more cancer cells than others do, mostly because our immune system doesn't manage to keep up with getting rid of the cancer cells fast enough. That is why things like proper exercise, proper diet, not smoking, etc. help to avoid recurrence. AlaskaAngel",

      "Content": "Dec 5, 2008 11:50AM - edited Dec 5, 2008 11:52AM by AlaskaAngel Hello. I am 6 years out from chemo. In general, more breast cancer patients gain weight than lose weight with treatment. If there were health care providers among the oncs and PCPs and nurses and technicians that are employed in providing treatments, maybe then patients would be given a better description of what goes on physiologically and psychologically and how to best deal with it. But I think you will find, as I did, that there are almost no health care providers among those you encounter who have actually had breast cancer AND been treated with chemotherapy and rads. Remarkable, but true. As you go through it, ask each provider and see for yourself. So here is one single breast cancer survivors perspective for you to consider. Chemopause and chemotherapy with steroids means in general undergoing the following changes: 1. The hormones that support tissue maintenance like estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone will be less from now on. Steroids can cause additional muscle breakdown, and increased appetite. The muscle breakdown results in actual muscle weakness, which makes it harder to effectively exercise, which means the same amount of exercise you did in the past is going to be harder to accomplish. Once a person gains a good chunk of weight, they are also clumsier. They are more susceptible to injury. For example, after treatment when I increased my exercise to what would have been customary for me before treatment, my knees swelled up to the point that I had to stop entirely to let them heal. No one from the \"treatment team\" is there to tell you any of these things or help you work through them. All the cheerleading to get you through treatment is over when you have had your last toxic therapy, and you are on your own. Increased weight gain puts women at higher risk for recurrence, so that leaves you in charge of cheerleading. Health care providers do not yet acknowledge to themselves or to patients that by causing weight gain during treatment, they are also at the same time predisposing patients to a greater likelihood of recurrence. Your permanently lower testosterone levels also reduce the ability to rebuild muscle tissue. At the same time that your muscles are not working as well as they used to be, your metabolism has slowed down permanently. This means that after treatment if you have gained weight or even stayed the same weight, you will have to get used to eating about 200 to 400 calories less per day that you have been eating for years. Also, the weight that is gained now tends to accumulate at the lower abdomen. Like the person who posted earlier who did FEC, I had CAF x 6 and gained over 20 pounds. Over the last 6 years I have managed to lose about 3 1/2 pounds per year. This is nothing to laugh at, because all of the above physiological changes due to hormonal changes and the use of steroids makes it much harder to make any progress. However, even though not a single health care provider I've had in the last 6 years has ever raised the issue of the importance of not being overweight as a way of avoiding recurrence, I know enough on my own that I continue to work at it. I saw a naturopath at the cancer center and my insurance paid for it, but he also did not deal with weight gain at all. I saw a nutritionist at the cancer center. My insurance didn't pay for any part of that visit. (That in itself says a lot about how much the medical world still needs to learn about prevention and cancer and treatment and rehabilitation.) But the nutritionist was very tuned in and extremely helpful. It was a really difficult visit for both of us, because it is hard to acknowledge that dieting and exercising work differently now for me and it IS much harder for me now than it was prior to treatment. I am now back to being barely within what is normal BMI for my height. (You can check yours by googling \"BMI\", and a calculator will come up for you to enter your height and current weight, so you can compare it to what is normal.) Try not to gain the weight in the first place. But whether you do or not, hopefully you might understand the reasons why things are different for those who truly become completely menopausal hormonally through chemopause in order to prevent recurrence. Best wishes, AlaskaAngel",

For example, people overwhelmingly tend to lean toward believing that the most godawful treatments must be better than the less awful ones, and that the worse they are, the more tough they must be on cancer. At the same time, only about 20% of early stage bc patients benefit from chemotherapy. In part that is because the majority diagnosed are hormone receptor positive, and they don't benefit as much from chemotherapy as hormone receptor negative patients do. But by golly, it is hard to get panicked hormone receptor positive patients to grasp that truth. When it comes to imaging, people also tend overwhelmingly to believe that the more expensive imaging must be \"better\" than the less expensive imaging. Not so. It is just one additional trick in the bag of tricks the radiologist has. It has its limitations just like mammograms and ultrasounds do. But that is why they start with the least expensive types of exam and then work up from there. And that is also why we don't just have MRI's for everyone, without mammos or ultrasounds. Each type provides different kinds of information. In your case I personally don't support a 6-month wait-and-see. At a minimum I would want repeat imaging of some kind and another physical exam at least 3 months sooner, and even though it seems to be unheard of commonly and is unsupported by the medical profession, I would want my physician to start having markers done, to establish a baseline if possible. (It isn't always possible, but to me it still is worth a try rather than going blind for 6 months. Jeez.)",

Diminishing density of the breast would reduce the \"support\" tissues in the breast, making the breasts more fatty (and clear) and less firm.

      "Content": "Sep 23, 2013 05:06AM - edited Sep 23, 2013 05:08AM by AlaskaAngel Hi A, Dense breasts, fibrous breasts -- think of it as being the structure that most of the breast tissue is supported by. The problem is that in mammograms, the structure shows on the image as being white, and cancer does too. The more structure there is that is supporting the breast, the harder it is to see any cancer, since they are both the same color. This is where usually in addition an ultrasound would be done. An ultrasound detects things like liquid-filled versus solid (and cancers are solid). They should be at the very least doing both another mammogram AND an ultrasound. The inverted or retracted nipple is of concern because as cancers grow, they displace other tissue and sometimes that means the distortion includes the nipple area. If your mammo AND ultrasound are still suspicious, likely you will need to have a biopsy and there are several types: FNA (fine needle aspiration, which is a tinier needle but can miss some cancer tissue because it is finer), core needle (which is a thicker needle), and other types that take more tissue. I would want to see a breast surgeon if possible if I were you. If you are very rural in Alaska that may be why you are being sent to the closest surgeon, a general surgeon, rather than a breast surgeon. If you want, you can send me a personal message through this site with any questions. P.S. Forgot to insert this answer to one of your questions: Diagnostic vs screening mammograms: AlaskaAngel",

I had Premara BC/BS and had my surgery in Seattle because my surgeon was so bad here, and it won't hurt for you to inquire. I'm glad your exams came back negative. But because it is hard to catch cancers early in patients with dense breasts, especially with prior questionable lumps or nipple problems, be quick to have repeat exams, even though they are a hassle I know.",

Those are the tools commonly used and the combination generally is reliable. But it can happen. Sometimes cancers can show up later as well, such as within months, that weren't seen when the studies were done. However, unless they see enough to concern them or there are concerning signs or symptoms, no further studies will usually be recommended. I don't want to be a wet blanket.

If the calcifications are shaped in a certain way, and if there are many of them concentrated in an area, that indicates that a cancer is \"more likely\".  They then do an ultrasound as well. An ultrasound tells whether the breast tissue has a solid lump or a fluid lump in that area, and whether or not the tissues around the lump have become pulled out of their usual shape by it. Sometimes they find additional areas to look at that maybe didn't have a lot of calcifications but still don't look normal on the ultrasound. A solid lump is more likely to be a cancer. A fluid lump is more likely to be a fibroadenoma and not cancerous. But they cannot tell for certain. That is why, if they think it might be, it also has to be biopsied by taking a piece of that lump out either by needle or by cutting it out, to put it under a microscope to see what the cells actually look like.

It is a very important drug that is used in situations where it is felt that the first-line antibiotics would not work as well, so I'm not saying it isn't helpful and important for some. What I am saying is that there are a significant number of people who have serious reactions to it as well. Because of a citizens outcry about these cases going unacknowledged by the medical profession, eventually the FDA was convinced it was important enough to add the black box to the written insert provided with the drug.

While I'm here...  I am happy to see more studies that are focused on ways to analyze who recurs and who does not, with the goal of better knowledge about who can avoid some treatments and who cannot. A trial that I think would fit the area you are interested in for genetic analysis is the NCT00897299. Identifying Genes That Predict Recurrence in Women with Breast Cancer Treated with Chemotherapy.... which seems to be a study of the kind I was talking about.... and yet.... it isn't, quite. Here's the actual language and focus: \" \"RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors predict whether cancer will come back after treatment. PURPOSE: This laboratory study is identifying genes that may help predict recurrence in women with breast cancer treated with chemotherapy.\"   and   \"OBJECTIVES: So.... I know it sounds like the result would, by coincidence, provide the information I am asking for... but to me the result is less definitive of the result I am looking for. I am asking them to use patients like me who have proven characteristics for nonrecurrence over \"x\" number of years.... characteristics that had a definite outcome, not a speculated risk that assumably is not certain for any particular individual. I'm asking that they nail down what characteristics absolutely provide no recurrence for \"x\" number of years through actual people who have actually not recurred. My question is a different question, one that would at least let some people definitely benefit. A.A.",

My thought upon reading your posts was simplistic in a way, but I am of the belief that not all answers have to be complicated even in a scientific environment. Sometimes a simple observation is intelligent. A recent study indicated that breast density is especially relevant in regard to whether or not a patient is benefitting from the use of tamoxifen. I can say that observation of breast density was true in my case. So keep this concept in mind, even in considering whether or not you personally would benefit from tamoxifen. My breast density after completion of CAFx6 and IMRT rads of 7 weeks was still very dense. After just 3 months of tamoxifen, my mammos were very clear and not at all dense, and they have remained that way ever since, despite my dropping off tamoxifen after only 1 year at full dose and 3/4 year at half-dose. At the time I noted the difference but no one else saw what it meant. I cannot prove it but I think I was one of those patients for whom tamoxifen works extremely well right off the bat. (My tumor was 95% ER+, but the recent study didn't mention whether or not they were smart enough to analyze the degree of ER positivity as part of that trial about breast density with tamoxifen.) What I wonder too is whether those who benefit right away like I did, stand to have adverse effects if they continue it TOO long.... but at any rate... Since some of you are going to be seeing experts soon about it, maybe you might ask them specifically about the recent study and whether or not they have gotten up some willingness to USE breast density as a way of measuring whether or not to initiate tamoxifen, and whether or not there is willingness to USE the degree of breast density to MONITOR as you go along on the drug, to see whether you can drop off of it sooner. Perhaps you could share their responses with us to keep us current. Just my 10 cents. A.A.",

It is well known that the vast majority of breast cancer patients are diagnosed after age 60.  It may be that there just isn't the capability to add another category of information in the signature. I do think, however, that the lack of that information as a rule is actually very problematic in that because most people who post do not indicate their age and/or menpausal status, the vast majority of breast cancer patients (those over age 60) aren't able to distinguish meaningful information about treatment for their situation and end up confused about it, and generally overtreated as a result.

I found out about my HER2 positive status somewhere around 1-2 years AFTER dx, and it was ONLY because I questioned it. The HER2 trials were coming to a close at the time I was diagnosed, so oncs were well aware that they were looking promising. The MO I had was considered top of the line....  and never once mentioned the possibility of trastuzumab or the trial, which I would have been eligible for at the time....and I had specificcally ASKED to participate in clinical trials... yeesh.... I'm just thankful that, as things turned out, I didn't need trastuzumab, and didn't end up costing myself and the world the extra cost for it.",

For some who have access to the top cancer care institutions, their own experience tends to make them believe that is how cancer care IS, and and they believe that is how it is \"done\" for all patients. It would be nice if everyone had that kind of access. But the reality is that plenty of cases are reviewed by local small tumor boards, even with no mention to the patient about the review of the case by any tumor board. I also don't think it is so shockingly terrible to be willing to question or comment adversely about the status quo, since that is often the basis for raising awareness of the variations in patient care, and for improvement of the status quo.

What has come to be the standardized process is to have a \"tumor board\" with a composition heavily favoring those whose job it is to do the cutting, radiating, and chemical treatments available to review the pathology, with the oncologist generally in charge of it. That isn't to say that they aren't focused on what they think is best for the patient, because they are. It is just to acknowledge that their expertise is cutting, radiating, and chemical use and they are much less educated in other types of medical knowledge. Knowledge about cancer is expanding in other areas of expertise, and maybe in a few decades there will be progress and  we might see other specializations finally having more authority in treatment recommendations than we've had thus far with the standardized make-up of tumor boards that has been static in place for so long. When the recommendations seem so limited and so harsh at times, that explains at least some of the mysterious reasons for it that aren't obvious when the entity is just called something so officially created and authorized as the words \"tumor board\". One tends to think that they are more well-rounded in their expertise than they really are. This was something I wasn't aware of at the time my tumor was reviewed 12 years ago, and its the same today as it was then.",

VR, Our history is similar in that my DH and I were healthy and \"invulnerable\" until we hit our 50's and 60's... then.... WHAM.... WHAM... we are at the point where we are reluctantly giving up some of the activities we have enjoyed because even with effort we are simply not as able to continue to do them without taking a lot more risk. I have always wondered and wished that research would spend at least a little time looking at those who do NOT recur, like me, to ferrit out why we haven't recurred, so that the information could be applied to more people who happen to have whatever test characteristics are meaningful from that kind of study so that they could be confident in foregoing some treatments. I was under the age of 55 at time of diagnosis as a HR+ HER2+++ patient and even today, 10 years later, the recommendation for those like me diagnosed now have not changed. Yet I did not do extensive treatment beyond chemotherapy and radiation and toda all tests are normal range and stable other than a slightly high alk-phos that has always been slightly high. mepic, for whatever reason, I have never ever felt concern about recurrence, but have felt terrorized by treatment. I take it for granted that each of us has no garantee that we will live any particular length of life, and I know that someday mine will end. I can only do what I think is best to get that far.

Generalizing about the use of OncotypeDx conveys the impression that it can be used by all to consider whether chemotherapy would be helpful, or whether tamoxifen is helpful. For example, we know that for about 1/3 of those who are HER2 positive, the addition of tamoxifen increases the risk of recurrence. Using the results of OncotypeDx for HER2 positive patients for the purpose of deciding whether chemotherapy is helpful for that group with the idea that HER2 is aggressive so therefore chemo is important, fails to recognize that by requiring the use of tamoxifen, for 1/3 of those patients the addition of tamoxifen can defeat the usefulness of chemotherapy.",

The only bread I eat now is the LaBrea whole grain bread, which is shipped to the grocery store and baked fresh. I am wondering if it comes close in content to what you bake? I slice it very thin and have 2 slices a day toasted, with olive oil and garlic..... But back to the main topic of this thread.... I am 61 now (also with no children) and have worked in several careers over my lifetime, and have enjoyed all of them. For the last decade or so I've been self-employed, working from my home. Last year, because of the steadily worsening radiation fibrosis that is tightening up the lumpectomy breast and pulling on the arm, and because that shoulder and arm have become weaker and weaker despite PT.... I reluctantly terminated the work I was doing independently and shifted to P/T call-when- needed work as an employee. That got me through the summer very well, but the arm and shoulder continued to weaken so I finally gave that up too. Other than the paycheck (!) I haven't missed working. My spouse retired a few years before I did. Last year a dog adopted us, the first dog we've had since my diagnosis. All 3 of us are very young senior citizens. We are housebound quite often in winter, and live a more relaxed lifestyle. We have to travel at least yearly to get some of the medical care we need now, and are often gone a month or more for that. This year it has been unusually snowy here, but I love the peaceful beauty of it, and our new partner sees to it that we don't stay stuck in our chairs all day. I got a copy of the series about exercise for those over 50 and am giving it a go. I had been jumping rope for exercise -- something I've done all my life for exercise, along with hiking -- but pretty much had to give that up, as my knees were very sore from it. We are far enough from town that it isn't practical for us to spend the money for gas and time in a gym or at the community pool on a regular basis, but my retired sibling lives in the Lower 48 only a block away from her community pool, so she enjoys making that part of her routine. I can honestly say that I am never bored.... I hope you find your own pleasures and delights as your circumstances allow.",

The initial path report often doesn't include all of the info because some of the tests like HER2/neu take longer to complete. So keep asking for that info if you dont' have it. Also, in comparing different people's situations, age at time of dx makes a difference; also, the majority of women diagnosed with bc are diagnosed when they are over the age of 50.",

I prefer having the CA 15-3 done, because even though it isn't accurate for some of us, it just gives me one more piece of information to base my decisions on about my risk level and whether or not to go ahead with further testing if I am on the fence about the risks of further exposure to radiation, for example.

I say \"wasn't\" because I am 10 years out now. My hair has been long to midback for about 5 years, which is what it was \"b.c.\" I keep it that way because I've only been to a hairdresser twice in my 61 years and don't want to deal with the frequent cuts, and it is easy to just wash and brush for me. I hesitated to post on this thread originally because it is about those who are doing mx and/or reconstruction, and I had lumpectomy x 1 side.  And yet.... I went ahead and posted because there doesn't seem to be any thread for the issue of gender loss when it comes to ovarian ablation. I think in part it is confusing for me because I don't feel like my boobs ever were or are all that related to my sexuality or gender, whereas the loss of hormonal influence is like watching my shadow walk along the sidewalk without any part of me in front of it.

      "Content": "Apr 6, 2012 12:53PM - edited Apr 6, 2012 12:54PM by AlaskaAngel I keep trying to get a grasp of what the difference between sex and gender is, and I'm not getting it. To me they are the same thing.... I think it would clarify things if we knew each other's ages and whether each of us has only recently gone through treatment, or is truly completely menopausal or not. I see a lot of posts by women who assume they are postmenopausal once they haven't had periods for a while, and the technical medical definition is 12 months without a period, but there is very little evidence to support that as being true postmenopause. It hasn't been adequately studied, and they have found that some women who retain their ovaries have significant hormonal influence as far out as a decade after they have stopped having periods. Everyone worries about physical appearance to some degree. My nose is bigger than I'd like, and the chemotherapy has affected the appearance of my bone structure of course and my teeth over time. The only other issue related to appearance is in regard to weight, which was never a serious problem until menopause and slowing of metabolism to a crawl. Even then, and even though it took 6 years to shed the weight I'd never had before that was gained from being sick and stuck doing treatment for so long, I was able to shed it. As the metabolism slowed even more, it all came back even with the more extensive exercise and strict dieting. I look feminine despite the weight, but I feel totally without gender and nonsexual, like a 5-year-old, and it is completely foreign territory for me. I tend to wear pretty overalls a lot because I am self-employed and work at home, and they are comfortable. I wear eyeliner and touch up my eyebrows because they disappeared with treatment, but I wear no other makeup. I wear feminine earrings and rings and a necklace. My husband and I have been married for 39 years, 40 this fall. It is like living with a brother not a spouse. In answer to your question, Outfield, no. Psychologically, since some of my work is in the medical field, it has been very traumatic that the very people who provide some measure for me of what sex and gender might be, including my PCP, act as if the loss to me is of no consequence at all.... as if I never had any gender or sex to begin with anyway.

What I don't \"get\" is the importance that is being put on feeling the power of being either feminine or masculine despite treatment. It sounds like it is important to have that sense of empowerment, and that it has nothing to do with sexuality per se. I'm not sure what the focus here is. I have no sense of gender and no sense of sexuality now. It isn't like I don't understand or appreciate female assertiveness/power or male assertiveness/power.

But your male friend is more accurate than not, and that is what I have tried to describe. A bc pal of mine with a dx similar to mine chose to do Herceptin without chemo, and she is only 4 years younger than I am and has had no loss of her sense of gender. She was already menopausal at time of dx, whereas I was premenopausal. A major difference between us is that she has not lost any of the \"impetus\" (which I believe is hormonally based) that drives her in ALL aspects of her life -- not just sexuality or gender. I think that there is a tendency for medical providers to think of hormonal levels as only affecting sexuality, when they actually affect all aspects of sensuality. The loss of total sensuality is what is so difficult to describe. It does affect gender and sexuality, but it is global, and not limited to just those specific areas of concern.

I am \"hoping\" to obtain the Scream Cream to see what it offers. But.... The Problem is not that simple. My DH too still wants some, but has not pressured me for it.

I had a BIRADS 4 that my surgeon would not biopsy and at that time it was 0.6 cm. By mammogram and ultrasound 6 months later, it was 1.0 cm and was cancerous, which resulted in a recommendation that I have chemotherapy. It CAN make a significant difference. If you have additional trouble getting more definite analysis or imaging of this, one test that provides a rough indication for possible bc would be to ask to have a CA 27.29 or a CA 15-3 lab test done. It is not considered reliable, but it may provide some information to indicate whether there is a suspicioius level of inflammation.

I wonder how many of the responses so far are from people who are not yet truly chemopausal or who perhaps didn't have any chemotherapy.  With chemopause and passage of time the effects of gender loss are more pronounced (and more devastating). When we consider that over 50% of those diagnosed with breast cancer are over age 60 at time of diagnosis, the majority of those diagnosed who do undergo chemopause have a significantly different gender experience than those who remain somewhat less than truly postmenopausal.

I wonder if this is due to our highly estrogenized, synthetic exposure today....  Anyway, aging generally results in appearing more and more androgenous physically with time, although each of us can dress it up to suit our individual inclination, or not. My impression is that many if not most people who have gone through treatment tend to take stock within a year of completing treatment, and assume \"that's it, this is how it is going to be\". If they still have some libido, they tend to post as though they have survived the storm and so that must be the \"norm\" among most breast cancer patients. But around 2/3 of all breast cancer patients are 55 or older at time of diagnosis, and most of those who post that they still enjoy some libido are under age 55 (which is only 1/3 of the patients dx'd with bc). I completed chemo and rads without loss of libido or any vaginal issues at age 52. Within 2 weeks of starting tamoxifen, vaginal dryness was painful and I had no libido, still at age 52. I used the e-string for 2 years and although it did nada for libido at least sex was less painful. So then I used \"creativity\" and explored new ways of touching, being more playful, etc. etc. with determination, but with no pleasure other than accommodating my spouse. It does get worse with time. I feel androgynous and asexual. I understand the importance of exploring new challenges and continue to do that. Achieving them provides no sense of accomplishment in that there is nothing to attach the achievement TO. A.A. P.S. My mother and one grandmother both had bc in their lifetime, but neither one did chemotherapy, and neither of them died of bc.",

What is so remarkable to me is that people trained in medical theory who understand and accept that hormones drive sexuality, and who even understand that excess hormones can drive aggressive behavior, are so completely determinedly blind to the understanding that the lack of hormones has a similar effect on the thought processes and behavior.

Please help to encourage her to continue to ask questions so that she can make sense out of the confusion of it all. Konakat, thanks for providing some helpful links. There are lots of questions to think about with each new diagnosis. Studies on the net are very difficult to analyze with accuracy, partly because by the time information is available from them, usually they are read without considering how much has changed in what is known now versus when the study was started. As I said earlier, the more advanced the cancer is, the more important having therapy is. Some of the reasons chemotherapy can end up not working, or even worse, causing cancer recurrence aren't obvious in the studies. For example, some of the studies include dose-dense treatment and some don't. Dose-dense almost always includes the use of non-chemo products such as blood production boosters. For some these products work well, and for some they don't; they are now under greater recommended restriction for use with therapy, as a cause for growth of cancer. This problem exists as well for those with higher stages of diagnosis, not just those who are stage 1. If we are going to speak to someone who is newly diagnosed, I hope we can be fair enough to explain this problem well enough that if their doctor is recommending dose-dense chemo and doesn't mention this issue, then as a patient that person would know they might need to understand more than just \"do the chemo, it isn't so bad, chemo saves lives\". There is just too much pressure to cave in to fear, and consider chemo the only logical choice, without being given the support to get a good understanding for making the best possible choice. In addition, because stage 0 to I cancer patients have lower rates of recurrence, the question arises as to whether chemotherapy actually makes much sense for them at all. We know that a fairly small percentage in this group will recur. We also know that among that group, there is a smaller group who, despite doing all the initial treatment with chemo and radiation and all the support drugs, promptly recur anyway. They truly lost the lottery. You and I may be fortunate enough that we aren't one of them but no one can truthfully say that doing chemo helped them. As well, others who are stage 0-1 sometimes recur after the first year, or two, or three. Did the chemotherapy delay their recurrence, or was that just an uninterrupted period of cancer growth regardless of treatment until there were clearer indications the cancer was always there? In most cases no one can say for sure. How are these numbers counted..? Are they counted as favoring chemotherapy because of the delay in documenting recurrence? When recurrence happens for a person who has never had chemotherapy, it happens not at the time of what was known and what treatments were available at diagnosis, but at a time when more has been learned and newer, better options are available to them, including other chemotherapies, and better information about the previously used support drugs for treatments. When recurrence happens for a person who has chosen the \"biggest guns\" available at the time of diagnosis, it can mean they are eliminated from participating in current clinical trials testing newer therapies because their previous therapy would distort the data. Given that for stage 0-1 we are talking about a much lower rate of recurrence to begin with, does it really make good sense to continue to support the belief that \"throwing the book at it\" right away makes genuine sense for this group? The reason I ask is because times have changed and a much higher percentage of all patients are being diagnosed as early stage. AlaskaAngel",

As a stage 1c, my concern was never about the risks of cancer but about the risks of treatment. It is a very different question and experience for those who are diagnosed at higher stages, in terms of fears and hopes and the greater need for encouragement. Part of the question involved here is that some of the readers of the two threads about perspective are those who are in the process of treatment, while others are in the process of making the decisions about treatment. I do agree with you in that once someone has made the decision, whatever they have decided, the most important support for them is encouraging them and getting them through it. For those who have not yet made the decision, both of the threads discussing perspectives about treatment provide the most support by providing as much objective truth as possible.  The problem is that the readers include people from both groups. Hillck, Correct. One shouldn't use the 20-30% statistic about second-line treatment to make the automatic assumption that first-line treatment would have the same result. I may not have clearly explained well enough when I presented that information (although I do think I did make that distinction) but it is a similar comparison in that it gives people some basis for understanding the success rate for at least one kind of chemo administration. I was using it to demonstrate that if it is possible to find the success rate for second-line treatment, logically we should also be provided the information as to the success rate for first-line treatment..... but.... so far, it seems that information is not readily available. The only time I've ever seen it was in the discussion I saw online among reputable oncs, and at that time it was mentioned as 17%. Given that the controversy seems to be rather significant among the people who are actually asked to make the choice about whether or not to do treatment, it is quite odd and seems quite unethical that no one here seems to have been given the information to answer that question, in order to help them decide based on the truth, whether to do treatment with chemotherapy or not. Yet claims about effectiveness or lack of it are made all through the discussion. I would think that if first-line chemotherapy does provide significant benefit on the whole and not just based on individual characteristics or experiences, those who provide chemotherapy would quite certain to be right up front with that kind of support information. But apparently that information is not easily available. A.A.",

I'm almost halfway there... but then, I'm also 60 now and don't expect to live forever.  It is terrific to have genuine clear opinions about treatment here for anyone who is thinking about how to best deal with cancer, to help them get a feel for it outside of what doctors tell them, especially when they get variable recommendations from physician consultations. So, how do I look at what others have posted?  Objectively speaking, most are posting within the first few years after doing treatment, so I know that they have not yet experienced full long-term effects yet, and hopefully they are honest enough to acknowledge that I have had that extra time that they haven't. I don't know how many were younger at time of diagnosis but the younger they were at time of diagnosis, the less full postmenopausal effect and added aging from treatment that they likely are experiencing. At the same time, I too have to recognize that HER2 positivity seems to end up with most of the HER2 population being younger than I was at time of diagnosis, which then makes the danger greater for them than it was for me. And all of the recent responses, with the exception of susieq58, and one stage 1 who was not recommended to do chemotherapy, have been from those at higher stages so we are in agreement about treatment, since I believe that adding chemotherapy makes more sense for higher stages (for those who are not compromised by other significant diseases).

Cooka, your dx shows higher risk than mine, as you are HR negative. The person who started this thread would prefer that all responses here be limited to posts only from those who do not regret it, which gives the impression no one would rather not have done chemotherapy.  As one of the more experienced stage 1 breast cancer patients, who often receive conflicting recommendations about chemotherapy from their medical providers, I feel stage 1 patients deserve a place in this discussion that allows them to acquire other patient perspectives.  Their situation clearly is different than the situation of higher stage patients BECAUSE medical providers are NOT universally in agreement based on the evidence thus far in making recommendations for their treatment. In addition, as noted previously, thus far with the exception of a few trials that are just now being offered, there has been no scientific investigation to demonstrate one way or the other whether chemotherapy in addition to trastuzumab is helpful or harmful. The original trials for the most part excluded stage 1 breast cancer patients.  Therefore, all the added risks of chemotherapy and all of its support drugs and periodic imaging with radiation tests for those stage 1's considering trastuzumab have not been adequately scientifically justified for HER2 positive stage 1 patients. In addition, even after many decades, we are unable to tell for certain in advance just which breast cancer patients benefit from it and that includes all stages. So far, no one has been able to provide the information on what the percentage of success (no recurrence) is for the group of all breast cancer patients over time posttreatment, so we don't have clear knowledge of who or how many are being helped by use of chemotherapy -- yet it continues to be the standard by which any other treatment must be compared, regardless of how effective or ineffective it may be in terms of the many OR the few. Some people prefer not to look very closely at what their options are, and prefer only encouragement for EVERYONE to complete treatment with chemotherapy, which is in itself known to be carcinogenic. I'm not one of those people. AlaskaAngel",

Long sentences ARE a problem! Using a thread title that says nothing at all about the limited expectation of the thread is not being straightforward, and outlining that expectation along the way doesn't change that. Those who have received treatment in the last 5 years have had far more access to information than was available at the time I was treated, so I should keep that in mind. I and my counterparts were lucky at the time to have the 3rd ed of Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book, with no online support whatsoever. I remember having to order a copy of the NCCN's breast cancer guidelines, just to see what they were. At my original surgeon's office in Alaska there was not a single flyer for breast cancer patients. I remember telling my onc multiple times that as a HER2 positive I wanted very much to particpiate in a clinical trial, to at least do what I could to contribute to progress. The idiot (and I don't say that lightly) at the very least could have told me to get online and have given me the site clinicaltrials.gov, since he failed entirely to tell me about the then-active clinical trials for trastuzumab. As a patient who was from small town Alaska and who asked him about the cancer center's video that I'd seen a flyer for, he didn't even tell me where the cancer center education department was so that I could check it out. Were ALL oncs like that? I had no reason to think they wouldn't be. Not a good start for this absolutely chemophobic stage 1. Thanks, A.A.",

We all want to believe that there will be a magic answer for our own cancer that will beat the odds. For the most part, research has been focused on testing a variety of very toxic synthetic treatments with the illogical notion that somehow, even without matching those treatments with our own individual genetic heritage or our lifestyle practices that can create havoc (pollution, abuse of substances including too much of foods that are bad for us), chemotherapy will blast the cancer to smithereens. It just ain't so. But it is entirely natural to want doctors to be able to do that for us. Modern society tends to think that anything can be bought if we just have enough money to pay for it. Rarely they stumble on one that actually works fairly well, like Gleevec. For the most part, however, chemotherapy is truly a shot in the dark. That is hard to explain in a way that people who are desperate to survive will understand or accept. As so many have posted in this thread, there are many more survivors (chemotherapy or not) than the interpretation about the numbers from that study seem to be telling you. The reason for that has a good side and a bad side. As odd as it is, the good news is that most people who do chemotherapy for breast cancer get no benefit from it at all and have to deal with all of its other effects. Why is that the good news? Because most people with breast cancer would live many years without ever recurring regardless of the treatment they choose beyond surgery, especially now that most are being diagnosed at a much earlier stage of the disease. This is a very controversial topic and always creates a lot of debate. Each one of us wants to be in the number that does not recur. Chemotherapy has a pretty low success rate for a few in either preventing recurrence altogether or delaying death. Some choose it because they feel they will be one of that limited group who does genuinely get that limited benefit, and for the most part there is no way to tell who will get it. Studies define groups among us who are more likely than other groups among us to get the most benefit, and doctors then recommend treatment for us based on what group we happen to fit into best by the characteristics of our tumors. There is as yet no way to tell for sure which individual person will get any benefit or how much benefit that individual will get from treatment. Each person has a different tolerance level for taking risks. Some will be more inclined to believe that doing very toxic therapy poses the least risk and the most benefit, and others will be more inclined to think it poses the most risk and the least benefit. The small percentage who actually do benefit from toxic therapy are that small group who win the lottery. The rest of us are just playing the lottery without any benefit and an unknown amount of harm. The problem with playing the lottery and hoping to be at best one of the small group that actually does get some benefit is that the scientific interpretation of study results fails to include a solid analysis of just which patients have recurrence or death due to the toxic therapy, or even due to the various drugs used in support of the toxic therapy, or to a combination of both. As the others have said in their posts, the perception that the group that survives more than 5 years is as limited as 2-3% is way off the mark so I hope that cheers you (and others) up. The rule of thumb is that the more advanced the cancer is by the time it is found, the lower the survival likelihood. At the same time, because of our individual genetic composition and our lifestyles and comorbidities, sometimes even the tiniest tumor can turn out to be one that benefits from the therapy. There are no garantees. So far unfortunately research has come up mostly with toxic therapies because more natural ones can't be patented and don't make money to pay for the research. Breast cancer is an ENDOCRINE disease and we need more research into the ENDOCRINE basis for each individual's cancer so that doctors can tell which part of that person's endocrine system is malfunctioning and how to best \"fix\" it if at all possible. There is good evidence that diet plays a major role for that, and especially that balancing types of fats eaten may be one of the keys, along with reducing the toxic substances that we eat (the pesticides, herbicides, hormones, antibiotics, and plastics residues with hormonal components that we are artificially introducing into the food chain). Another key would be consistent adequate exercise. Those are things that are hard to get people to do. They would often rather get through the challenges of toxic treatment in the hope that they won't have to permanently improve their eating habits and exercise habits. Hope this helps, AlaskaAngel",

Given that: The standard regimens for initial treatment for some years now have been TCH, AC+TH, AC+T, (and for non-USA primarily, FEC or CAF plus H for some). For some the C has been carboplatin and for some the C has been cyclophosphamide. Aside from those standard chemotherapies, there is targeted trastuzumab and lapatinib (although those too work for an unpredictable subgroup of those who are HER2 positive, so it isn't actually yet truly \"targeted\"). and Because of the wide diversity of all our individual characteristics, in some distant lifetime there is hope for the possibility of other targeted therapies. It is understandable that there is a strong inclination to encourage others to gamble on being lucky enough to win the chemo lottery, and to keep doing the same standard treatments listed above. It takes courage to forego that standard treatment in order to seek to develop something better, just as it also takes courage to go forward with the unknowns of the chemo lottery. Hopefully that is understood. Favoring a focus on that same basic set of options means that we as patients are going to avoid the potential for improving the status quo, and that we in effect fully support maintaining the current volume of recurrences/mets. Here is my question. For those who are glad they did or are doing one of those therapies that have been standard treatment for some time now, do you favor continuing the status quo for the volume of recurrences that occur with those therapies? If not, how does encouraging others to do the same therapies do anything but support continuing the same volume of recurrences/mets for those who lose the chemo lottery? AlaskaAngel",

I thought all threads were open to polite and informative discussion, including opinions that differed based on personal experience.

I'm wondering how any trials for treatments that stand to be better than chemo would ever get the patient participation to motivate doctors to seek it and financiers to pay to prove it, since patients are so completely convinced that the best protection is by doing treatment with chemotherapy, and the current medical/pharmacologic practice has so little financial reason to pursue it -- knowing that patients are so enthusiastic about making sure they do chemotherapy to be \"on the safe side\". ?

Some find comfort in doing whatever is standard treatment, and get it over with and hope for the best, and some feel that treatment that hasn't changed or improved much in decades and still can't be predictable for the individual patient isn't comforting at all. There should be lots of discussion pro and con for people to be able to make a choice that they feel is best for them. Some people want lots of reassurance and promises and encouragement regardless of the facts pro and con, and then get mad if it doesn't pan out. Others make up their minds to do standard treatment after consideration and just need encouragement to get through the long succession of treatment. It is logically hard for me to accept the black-and-white thinking of chemotherapy based on occasional expensive large clinical trials that after decades still isn't predictable for the individual patient, and often only offers temporary effect. To provide the broadest range of thought about ALL possibilities, I want to mention that one might want to review and consider the option of metronomic chemotherapy. When I was considering treatment, I did have a consult with the Cancer Treatment Centers of America and metronomic chemotherapy was being offered there. Has anyone seen any major cancer center make the effort to run a clinical trial to determine whether or not metronomic chemotherapy with trastuzumab is a preferable option in regard to early stage HER2 positive bc? If the question isn't even being considered then we are back to the black-and-white standard therapy that hasn't improved much for decades.

One of my frustrations is that the farther out from treatment one is as a NED, the fewer trials I am eligible for.  (I've participated in 2 trials, and dropped out of another one before starting it after qualifying.) It is similar to the basis by which trastuzumab trials were done. As long as they excluded the largest group of breast cancer patients -- those who were early stage (due to earlier detection/mammography, etc.) the results looked much better, because only those patients who were more likely to recur were allowed to participate, and that made the results more dramatic.  But that also ended up creating a false impression about how effective it might be for early stage bc patients and left them having to endure chemotherapy whether or not chemotherapy helps.

I listed as many as I could find of those trials on page 15 of the thread When Do Most Recurrences for HER2 Happen? on the forum for HER2/neu positive patients. I can't agree with your statements here, since science continues for the most part to falsely imply that chemotherapy drug regimens are logically the \"standard\" for comparison. Scientifically speaking, chemotherapy is just one more variable like any other due to its poor track record in general, and even more so in that there is no way to predict what chemotherapy regimen or drug will work for any particular person. In addition, it would be really helpful if oncologists would provide what the percentage success rate is for the application of chemotherapies to breast cancer patients as a whole group. From what I understand, the chemotherapy regimen is verifiably useful 20% or less of the time that it is used -- in part because some patients never needed it and in part because the chemo didn't match the patient's cancer characteristics. Please don't rely on that information; take the time to ask your oncologist. It would be very interesting to know what all of those here find out, with documentation. My personal basis for making that statement is from an online discussion among oncologists around 2006 or 2007, but perhaps someone can further determine what the percentage is currently. As I understood it, that 20% or less includes those for whom chemo did not continue to provide success. The minimal record of success is a rather unscientific way to choose a \"standard\" to compare everything else against, or to fail to investigate other treatments used alone for a decade or more at a time.

Some certainly will believe \"chemo saved them\" anyway. But NOT all can just do surgery, which is the less good news. In other stages the number who would never need anything more than surgery is less, but still present. There are those hidden HER2' positives who happen to be like me, who never need trastuzumab at all, so that is also a reason for hope no matter what they decide to do. Some of them will certainly believe that trastuzumab \"saved them\" anyway. But NOT all can safely leave trastuzumab out, which is the less good news about that. LtotheK, The only problems I see with 1-5 are that: Chemotherapy has been used as THE way to achieve ovarian ablation for so many of the studies, rather than carefully using less toxic methods for that in making comparisons (along with the additional treatments of radiation, other hormonal treatment, etc.) and 5.  Because of the underrepresentation of stage 1's in the HER2 trials, it will be a long, long time before Adjuvant will be able to figure in exactly what effect trastuzumab used along with menopausal achievement by means other than chemotherapy does in comparison to chemotherapy + trastuzumab. Hi Apple: I posted my dx in several responses but it is long and has to be typed in each time to get the clearest description of it, so sometimes to keep the posts shorter I leave it out. P.S. Also, Blondiex46 is the other shoe. None of us here know whether or not we will still eventually recur, whatever treatment we choose.",

On the one hand there is the concern for the very young newbies, who have a difficult rate and speed of recurrence and mets that is so hard to effectively address, and then there is the frustration with the lack of sigificant progress in reducing recurrence/mets for all groups. I appreciate the differing viewpoints. When it comes to chemotherapy pro or con, the status quo is clearly not scientifically based when it comes to early stage breast cancer. The system of testing therapies against metastatic patients first and then making chemotherapy the standard for other treatments to be compared to it doesn't allow true scientific consideration of the chemotherapy itself as being simply one out of many variables. For early stage breast cancer, chemotherapy continues to be required as a standard practice regardless of whether there is true justification for it. It continues to be required even though it is known to be a carcinogen, and as such, is capable and likely to be causing a certain amount of cancer in the group that is especially unlikely to need chemotherapy in the first place. It continues to be officially promoted as a \"protective\" solution for this group despite the failure to research each and very variable equally in the treatment specifically in behalf of this group. So when it comes to being protective of ALL newbies--including young newbies--who are early stage, that is a genuine concern, not an imaginary one. AlaskaAngel",

Will it be any of you? Who should be that person? As it stands, doctors will not recommend any such drug for that very first patient, because any kind of new drug always has to be done in conjunction with chemotherapy as the standard of care, so that everyone can say the chemotherapy was what made the difference, and so that everyone will continue to believe that we all must do chemotherapy no matter what, to be \"safe\".... literally a \"no-brainer\". When my onc asked if I wanted to do trastuzumab and advised me not to, I took some risk and won that lottery. Ditto for the AI's, and for not doing 5 years of tamoxifen. All of which \"can't be done\", because everyone is convinced it is just too risky. My \"guess\" is that most if not all of those here found my signature almost impossible. But the truth is that the majority of stage 1's don't need anything but surgery to avoid recurrence. And it is particularly interesting to be a live person who is recurrence-free as a HER2+++ who never did trastuzumab because in a time when it is automatically given to everyone, the belief becomes more and more solid that it is not possible for anyone who is HER2+++ to not have recurrence without it -- even though it is known that trastuzumab only works for about half of those who get it, doesn't work for some like me at all, and stops working for many. That is the power of positive thinking. And yet, most breast cancer patients do not perform daily exercise to lower their risk factor! A.A.",

As long as no one ever proves that chemotherapy as a carcinogenic sometimes actually causes breast cancer, the assumption is that it doesn't. So, if you are looking at statistics that list secondary cancers but don't ever list any column titled \"breast cancer caused by chemotherapy\" to tallly for that possibility, and that only list possibilities such as later leukemia, etc. you won't \"have\" any \"proof\". Try to find any indication in Adjuvant Online, for example. (Hint: Look at the numbers of those who completed all recommended treatment and recurred anyway -- and who wonder why.) Cooka, The few studies that are being done with trastuzumab alone for limited groups are going to apply only to those limited groups. The longer it takes, the longer it takes for the data to be considered \"5 years out\" for them, or \"10 years out\" for them, to get to the point where then another baby step is taken. Meanwhile, the wealthy countries continue to use massive overtreatment, while those in less prosperous countries can't afford to give those at highest risk reasonable treatment, and somehow we justify those numbers of dead people, as if one woman in Chicago USA is any more important than one in the Congo. ",

I do think those who turn down chemo are still a minority mostly because it is hard to figure out why so many choose chemo when the numbers are strongly in their favor to avoid it. Saying this out loud in a public forum is not popular. Any of us can recur at any time.
