Thanks for the replies.  I am new to this site so I wasnt sure if when you read my inquiry that my diagnosis information was indicated for those that were reading.  Stage 4 Lobular 2/11 with bone mets in hips, ribs, spine and pelvic. Currently on Femara & Faslodex.  My oncologist is aware of my feeling tired and  I was just seen by my family practice doctor on Tuesday of this week and let him know that I was extremely tired and of the kidney pain.  We have sorta figured out what that could be coming from now.  In 2012 I had 3 large kidney stones in the right kidney.  They lazer removed them but was not able to get all of the left over fragments in the top part of the kidney.  When I had the lower abdomen CT scan completed my doctor was able to see some small fragments in the kidney.  He feels with the dye/contrast and iron infusion could possibly cause the fragments to be on the move and pass.  I am taking pain meds and I do feel better now.  I am still tired but feeling better.   I think it was just the combo of treatments within a window of time.  I hope to be returning to work sometime next week.  That is really the hard part of this journey trying to live a somewhat normal life and fighting a disease at the same time.  Working 8 hours a day seems impossible some days.  Thanks again for your replies and have a great sunny day on your side of the street - Deb ",
