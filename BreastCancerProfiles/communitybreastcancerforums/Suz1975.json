They're thinking Chemo at the moment but obviously I won't be sure until the results come back. Can I ask, how long was the recovery period for your double mastectomy? My surgeon recommended to do them as separate operations if I chose to have them removed... I was considering it but am concerned about how long I'll be out of action for.",

I have no idea what the pathology report means, but I have a 2.7cm x 11mm lump and prominent axillary nodes. My  nipple is slightly Inverted, I have pain in both breasts, and have a small hole in my nipple that won't heal, hence why I'm thinking Pagets. My aunty was diagnosed with HER2 positive BC aged around 42. I wish I knew more but I've heard on these posts to be patient, I'm doing my best. I'm recently divorced and don't get on well with my ex, we have a 6 year old and a 2 year old that mostly stay with me. I'm already tired, so not sure how I'm going to cope with whatever treatment I need, whilst looking after my kids. I'm not good at asking for help, but I guess I'll have to learn huh. I'm still reeling form the news, it feels really surreal.

My appointment with the Breast Centre is tomorrow, I just wish I knew what to expect. I'd like to know exactly what I'm dealing with, and am worried they'll just refer me for more tests, which means more waiting. It's hell on my nervous system, thinking the worst.... I'm actually hoping it's HER+ as it seems to respond well to chemo. All I can do is speculate right now and it's driving me crazy. But otherwise I'm ok. I'm in NSW, near Newcastle.",

I considered a Mastectomy but will wait to decide as the recovery time is too much with two small kids. So here we go... I'm patiently waiting to find out more after Surgery.

I'm already down one nipple and one cup size on the right, I'm not ready to cut more off me yet. I think im getting to the anger part.... cancers a bitch but I'm angry at the way the whole process steers us first to surgery then oncology, it's like a process line at the beginning... the surgeon cuts then I get to talk to someone who knows about cancer.... doesn't seem logical to me...",
