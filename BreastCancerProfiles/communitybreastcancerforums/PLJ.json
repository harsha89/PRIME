I was told that the Oncotype scores have not been validated to correspond with IHC staining because they measure different things. You can read about the formula to understand what is measured but their results have only been studied to correlate with RS. Because they measure very different aspects of a tumour, along with the fact that tumours are heterogeneous, you can't seek to make a connection. Just like different slices will perhaps stain differently, thereby yielding various % staining, the intracellular mRNA evaluated in Oncotype dx may yield a different result to pathology report. Again, because the means of recording a score is unique to Oncotype Dx, there is no scale to translate this number to correspond with pathology. Apples and oranges. Kam170: It is my understanding that if both IHC and Oncotype come back with positive scores for a particular receptor, then the receptor should be functioning. However, if one is positive and the other negative, then it is questionable whether the receptor would actually function as it should.",

Several conversations and pages of questions answered later, I was satisfied! :) When ER is highly +, along with a low mitotic rate (or ki67), you get your biggest bang out of hormonal therapy and chemo is typically a less efficient means of cell death. Of course other things like nodal status, grade, size, histology, Her2 and LVI are also taken into consideration when contemplating the big chemo question. It is my understanding that the ER, PR and ki67 scores are given considerable weight in the Oncotype Dx formula. Had my Oncotype Dx PR come back -, I'll bet my RS score would have pushed me into the intermediate range and chemo would have been recommended. It would be nice if Genomic gave a complete print out for all of the genes evaluated. It is frustrating to have some of your personal health information kept in secrecy.",

I sought 2 consults and ended up with 4 MO opinions: unanimous No chemo. I was 40 at dx and hope to have many more years ahead. It is true that chemo is not well suited to slowly dividing cells. Check your path report for mitotic rate or ki-67 and get a couple of MO consults. Chemo provides a 30% absolute risk reduction so your relative reduction based on 8% recurrence would be an additional 2.4%. I was told the risk of doing chemo was 3%, which includes 1% risk of death upon infusion. Weigh your personal benefit/risk with an MO who you trust, make the decision and never question yourself. Take the path of least regret: how would you feel if you didn't do chemo and the cancer came back? What if you did chemo and it came back anyway? What if you did chemo and suffered serious side effects from the treatment? Deciding treatment is very difficult. If you are premenopausal and decide no chemo, there are other treatments that can significantly reduce your risks and have fewer side effects. Google ABCSG-12 Dr. Gnant's clinical trial and take a copy to your MO. This may be another option for you to consider. Best wishes and hugs! PLJ",

I have since learned that it all depends upon how much nerve damage you have post BMX. I have *full* sensation where the drains exited and it was pretty painful. If you touch the skin beside the drain exit and have great sensation, then I would take something prior to removal. It felt like she was ripping open my skin. (The second one was kind of 'stuck' so it took longer.)",

However, mitosis was 1, mixed mucinous carcinoma (so size was actually smaller than 1 cm because of some mucin), no LVI, clear node (only 1...gulp) and all positive prognostics. Oncotype came back at 16 and all 4 MOs with whom I spoke (1 was family), said very strongly that the se's of chemo outweighed the benefits for me, with there being a 1% risk of death from the chemo upon infusion not to mention the other potential serious side effects. I finally settled for Tamox, ovarian suppression along with 6x Zometa as per ABCSG-12 protocol. Was this the correct decision? I'll let you know in about 22-24 years, when my risk for recurrence drops to 0. The flip side is how would I feel if I had ignored their opinions and insisted on chemo then had severe se's, heart failure, leukemia...but no recurrence? It is all so very confusing and I wish it was an easy decision. Like someone else said, decision to do BMX was *so* much easier...just take'em off! I wish you well and peace of mind as you make your decision. Once you have accepted a treatment plan, never look back!",

In fact, each one of them used scare tactics and said they would not prescribe it for me as the risks outweighed the benefits. I hope they are right. Like everyone else, I could only move forward with the information at hand and hope for the best. Whether that means chemo or not, be at peace with your decision. So you see, chemo is not automatically recommended for all early stagers. As for ER+ posing a threat for eternity, my MO told me that 95% of ER+ recurrences are caught by year 10 and by year 22, recurrence risk drops to 0.",
