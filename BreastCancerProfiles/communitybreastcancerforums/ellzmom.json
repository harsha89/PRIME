Mom's symptoms were vomiting, headaches, loss of memory and balance. To make matters worse, she was given too much Decadron (4mg every 12 hours) which caused delirium and insomnia ( steroid psychosis) for three days. This wore off but Mom's still in the hospital (16 straight days) and back on 2mg of Decadron once a day in the morning, which is alleviating some of the head pressure, we're told. Currently mom is extremely weak, bedridden and not talking, unless asked a question. She also sleeps well and seems to have awareness of her surrounding. Since she's only able to lie on her sides due to head pains when on her back, her radiologist said mom would need anesthesia in order to remain motionless for total brain radiation treatments. Also, the resident Doc in her care has all but pronounced her dead and wants to literally (it seems) kick her out with no radiation, and to a hospice. At first the radiologist agreed to begin the 10-day cycle of radiation but recently changed her mind, concurring with the resident Doc that radiation will not be beneficial since she only has \u2018months to live'; the radiologist was obviously influenced by the resident Doc. Should we demand radiation treatment or get mom to another hospital? We just wanna give mom a fighting chance.",

This is my first post and I apologize for the long length but I promise to be more succinct in future updates.   I'll continue with updates for as long as this site is available :) From what I'm able to glean thus far, this is one awesome site and I'm glad I found it. I'm here for my 67yo mom. Here are the facts, history and my questions for any of your advice or support: -2005 mammo was clear but in 2006 a small mass was spotted with no action by the Doc who reassured mom that all was well. -The 5/2007 mammo revealed same lt breast nodule, slightly larger, which was biopsied/ultrasound and verified malignant in 6/2007. - In 7/2007 the initial and official dx was Stage 1, Grade 3, ER-/PR- and HER2 Equivocal (FISH) at age 65. (IDC, with necrosis and febrosis, PT1c, DC in Situ) -First PET scan in 8/2007 confirmed left breast cancer with zero spreading, followed by surgery to clean margins and a partial mastectomy vs opting for full mastmy. -First chemo round was 8 weeks (don't recall name) followed by 6 weeks radiation. -Herceptin was started before the end of the 8-week regimen.  After radiation and while on Herceptin, mom experienced shortness of breath during a brisk walk which turned out to be a left pleural effusion.  Initial draining revealed a positive liquid test (thoracentesis) for malignant pleural effusion. -Second round of chemo (Navelbine) started for six months in attempts to resolve the malignant pleural effusion.  (I say in \u2018attempts' because the Onc expressed shock that Herceptin had not controlled the spreading.)  Onc also considered using Tykerb but chose Navelbine. -Second PET scan confirmed metastatic involvement of the pleura with tiny nodules in pleural sac. There was also no evidence of disease (NED) in left breast. -Pleural effusion recurred shortly after being on Navelbine, leading to a chemical pleurodesis (tube was inserted thru left side near under arm for draining, followed by chemical and suction).  According to mom, this was the most painful of all her health issues/experiences/procedures) -Navelbine/Herceptin continued until the end of the sixth month, and then a PET scan (third) was ordered.  All the while mom is living normally with not much discomfort, even able to maintain a regular and moderate exercise program. -The third PET scan revealed no improvement.  Navelbine did not work.  In fact the official report stated, \"In comparison with a previous PET/CT, there has been progression of metastatic disease in the pleura of the left lung and new hypermetabolic foci in the left lung base.\"   Again, there was also no evidence of disease (NED) in left breast. -The Onc (Oncologist) said not to worry, all will be well, and immediately started Mom on her third round of chemo, namely, Tykerb w/Xeloda, with a planned PET scan after 4 months (3 months to go). Now time for some questions, some of which may not matter at this point (questions are in not particular order): 1) What is mom's current diagnosis? Is it what's on the last PET scan? My take would be, \"malignant pleural effusion from breast-to-pleura spreading.\" 2) Did Onc make mistake continuing with Navelbine after the pleural fluid reaccumulated? 3) Would full mastectomy of left or both breasts have stopped/controlled breakaway cells? 4) Did spreading of cells happen during surgery to clear margins? Is this possible? 5)  At what point did pleura become infected when spreading wasn't detected at first PET scan? 6) Was Mom's case (Grade3) so aggressive that 8wks+6wk radiation+herceptin did not control spreading to left pleural sac? 7) Why does Onc wait until six month or four months before ordering PET scan? Are there no other methods to track or detect the efficacy of these medications???? 8) Does Chemical Pleurodesis ever heal????????? It has been about six months (since 10/2008) since the surgery and Mom is still has intermittent major under-arm discomfort/pain.  Is this scar tissue? 9) Should Onc be jettisoned for another?  How about a second opinion at this point? Anyway, Mom's two year battle continues and she's surviving it all mostly through faith in Jesus Christ.
