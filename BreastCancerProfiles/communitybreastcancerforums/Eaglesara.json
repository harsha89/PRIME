Just saw my surgeon today and reconstruction last week.  Choosing a BMX with the hopes of never having to be in this position again.  Not nervous, feeling confident and almost excited to have this part over and done with.  My chemo was over in February - it really sucked the life out of me, still dealing with some side effects but enjoying some \"normalcy\" in my daily life.  I will follow with 5-6 weeks of radiation (depending on pathology) and reconstruction in the Fall.  I am giving this one year and then I want to move on with life.",
