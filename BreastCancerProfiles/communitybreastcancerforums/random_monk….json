Indeed I was reading through the reports from different trials and note that they are usually follow up since 10-15 years ago. Unfortunately there just isn't enough data on the new technology that gives us the confident to go for it.",

Almost every single of them gave us the impression that they were hard-selling the treatment without knowing what they were selling. Separately we also booked an appointment with another radiation oncology to seek for second opinion. Indeed, we just have find that someone that gives us confidence. So far, we were told that she has 2% of increased chance of lung cancer, 2% more for heart problem in return for 5-10% improvement 10 years OS. The statistics does not differentiate the number of nodes which I am not entirely convinced after much googling as I found most of them do. Hopefully the second opinion gives us the much needed faith on the treatment. Thank you everyone for sharing their experience on radiotherapy. We will also ask more about their radiation device",
