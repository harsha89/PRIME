I still have never had an MRI or a 3d mammogram. I am having a 6 month post lumpectomy mamma on my right breast in May. That is all and I am concerned because I feel like I should have more extensive screenings. I asked about my left breast and they said \"oh you will just get your annual order from your ob gyn for that\" uh really? because I came here to this acclaimed NCCN cancer center to get the best care. I just don't understand the path forward with all of this. It seems like their concensus is to be reactive and not proactive.",

I don\u2019t the exact degree of my density , I feel like the reports said the patient has heterogenous dense tissue or something like that. My surgeon told me 50% of people under 50 have dense tissue so it is not really rare. Prior to my diagnosis I had 3 years of standard mammograms and no findings. Not even calcifications , so this came out of nowhere. I did read in Dr Susan Loves Breast Book that tamoxifen reduces density almost immediately so I am hoping that will also aid with future diagnostics.",

My BS , the head of breat surgery at an NCCN accreditedcancer centertold me he used to do MRIs on about 80% of his cases and now he does them on about 20% due to the number of unnecessary and more complex surgeries that resulted from inaccurate mri results. I will ask again about mri in May at my next appt.",
