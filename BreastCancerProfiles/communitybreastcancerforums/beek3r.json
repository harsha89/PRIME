I have just seen my doctor due to many occurring symptoms that i possibly have cancer and he has informed me i was too young to have cancer. I really would like to get a second opinion but I'm not sure how to go about it or if i even should. My symptoms are as follows: Both of my breast are red. The pours on my breast have enlarged massively, like an orange. I have dimpling on both breasts. I have scaly itchy skin all over both. There is a lump on my underarm (which i forgot to mention to the doctor). So i tried my best to point these things out to my doctor whom seems confused on what i was trying to explain. He said the dimpling was due to my weight...... so that is confusing me, since I'm over weight my breast are pitting? That makes no sense to me. I guess I'm really just looking to see if anyone else has experienced these symptoms and had it be nothing. Log in to post a reply",

I spoke with a friend who had IBC which is why I decided to see other people's opinions. Right now I'm pretty much just going to wait it out and see what happens. Thanks ðŸ˜Š",
