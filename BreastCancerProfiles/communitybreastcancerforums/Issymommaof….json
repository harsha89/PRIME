No focal area having morphologic or dynamic enhancement features suspicious for malignancy. No abnormal skin, nipple, or chest wall enhancement. No adenopathy within right axilla or along the internal mammary chain. LEFT BREAST: Mild background parenchymal enhancement. No focal area having morphologic or dynamic enhancement features suspicious for malignancy. Particularly, there is no abnormality in the upper outer quadrant. No abnormal skin, nipple, or chest wall enhancement. No adenopathy within left axilla or along the internal mammary chain. SO- Yay! But, what the hell am I feeling in my breast? Hopefully if/when the BS's office calls, I can get a clearer understanding. very glad they didn't see anything, but I would love to know why I can feel this, my husband can feel this, my doctor can feel this, but it doesn't show up on imaging.",
