While my tumor was definitely shrinking by the feel of it (we didn't do imaging during or after chemo and it wasn't palpable at all after 4AC and 4Taxol), I still had most of the tumor left in my pathology and 5 positive nodes. I know ER+/PR+ don't often have a pCR, so I wasn't expecting it to completely go away, but I was hoping for at least some reduction. I had clear but close margins. I remember sitting in the office at the beginning of this whole ordeal saying 'I want it out, now.' and my nurse navigator talked me into chemo. If I could go back, I probably would have asked for surgery first...maybe? I don't really know.",

I am going to respond with a large emphasis on the fact that this is a breast cancer community board, so while it is likely that what you are experiencing is not cancer, you may get a filtered view by coming here and I wouldn't want to worry you unnecessarily. The ladies that have experienced something like this and found out it was not cancer are not likely still lingering on these boards to answer your question. I had finished breastfeeding for about 4 months when I found my lump and went to the breast center almost immediately (no family history either). They told me it was likely due to breastfeeding - did mammo and US, told me I had dense breasts, it was probably benign and come back in 6 months. I don't have the details of my original US report. I waited 4 to come back, was turned away again, and then, 8 months after I found the lump, I was diagnosed with Stage III cancer. Given my experience, I would push for a biopsy, especially if it grows over the next few months. If it stays the same, gets smaller/softer, etc, then I would not worry.",

It has not gotten better and recently, I feel like it has gotten worse. About 9 months after completing chemo (6 mo after rads finished) I started to get what I think are ocular migraines.These are triggered by light (I think) and also seem to happen when my eye is 'blurriest.' I've had two MRI's in the past year (June and January). I don't understand the reports (below) and when my MO saw it he said \"not sure what it is but it's not cancer.\" Good, but, umm, okay. Any one know what to think of this report and if all these things linked are something I should worry about, or chalk it up to post cancer treatment fun? Thanks. MRI 1 - June 2018 Findings: Age-appropriate craniofacial structures. The orbits, skull base and pituitary fossa are within normal limits. Normal intracranial anatomy with no evidence of extra-axial fluid collection, mass lesions, midline shift, hydrocephalus or brain herniation. A few tiny scattered foci of increased T2 signal are noted in the deep white matter of the left hemisphere. No evidence of acute ischemia or parenchymal hemorrhage.

Brain: Stable scattered approximately 5 punctate T2 hyperintense foci in the deep white matter of the left hemisphere are nonspecific. Brain parenchyma is otherwise within normal limits in signal and volume for age. No suspicious enhancement. Vessels: No abnormal intravascular signal to suggest thrombosis. Bones: No suspicious lesion in the calvarium or skull base. Other: Extracranial soft tissues are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: 1. No suspicious mass or enhancement. 2.

I think it will also take them a while to determine this, and I don't *think* there is any preliminary data, which suggests they are not seeing trends yet (this makes sense because recurrence can take time). I can give you my experience: I am on Exemestane, Prolia (every 6 months), Lupron (to shut down my ovaries), Vitamin D and the Ibrance. My side effects have been manageable and I don't regret entering the trial for side effects. Yes, I have hot flashes and I'm tired (also have two young children and work full time). I expected my menopause symptoms to be worse because I am young as well and have not found that to be so. And I get occasional joint stiffness and headaches and constipation when I'm not hydrated enough. None of my side effects are severe enough to consider dropping any of my medications. I know it's a hard decision, even after I thought I wanted in and wanted the Ibrance so badly, I had a period of time where I thought I might regret it. Who knows how it will turn out! It makes the decision making even more frustrating that you have a limited period of time to make it as well. Good luck, and let us know what you decide!",

It's not the fatigue I felt during radiation or chemo - I'm hoping it doesn't get to that point. @anna-33, I have had some dizziness and headaches, but I thought that might be from the Aromasin - are you on Aromasin?

I pushed for extra chemo and went to Hopkins for a second opinion, and everyone says with hormone positive, that your hormone therapy is more likely to be effective. So I'm on hormone therapy. I did the CTC test (on my own, bc my provider could not do it), but mine came back negative (prior to starting AI). I know the ctDNA test is more sensitive, and I plan on doing that one in about 6 months. I might suggest trying the hormone therapy and repeating the test in 3-6 months? Also, I agree with WC3 that you should discuss with an oncologist and possibly seek a second opinion. Good luck and let us know what you decide.",
