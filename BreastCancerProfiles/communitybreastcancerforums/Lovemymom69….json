She's had a pretty rough time very little moments of good news. Was told there is many may options for treatment. She was on let letrozole then ibrance and now these shots (can't recall the name) 2 shots in the bottom. All which has failed the NP said Xeloda or comfort care which has me baffled and upset because this doesn't sound like loads of options to me and her brain Mets is stable and all other areas are fairly stable or very small. I asked about the keytruda option and was told that isn't an option for er+pr+her2- breast cancer patients. I asked about other immune building options along with treatment and she acted like there wasn't any. I see your cancer is same as my mom's any advice?",
