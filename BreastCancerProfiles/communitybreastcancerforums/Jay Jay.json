Those 12 weeks will be followed by 40 weeks of once a week treatment of Herceptin. Total 64 weeks in all. I have a feeling my follow-up will be the rest of my life. They gave me 7 to 10 days before I'm bald. Two days ago I did a preemptive cut of 8 inches all over my head. So I'm close to bald already. After breast cancer in 2005 I grew my hair to donate to Pantene. In 2005 I only needed 7 weeks of radiation. If I can figure out how, I'll post a photo of the side effects",
