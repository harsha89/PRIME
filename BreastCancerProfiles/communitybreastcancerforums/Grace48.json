Thank you for your help",

Had a small Stage 1 18 years ago and had right mastectomy so I had no radiation or chemo.  Don't know the grade of that one.  I had no reconstruction at that time but will have it now.  Oncologist has suggested raditation or radiation implant.  We have also discussed my having mastectomy on the left breast which avoids radiation, etc.  And possibly having reconstruction at the same time.  I also have the option of skipping radiation entirely and just going for the reconstruction and see what happens in the left breast following up with mammograms.  WHEW...so I keep confusing myself and trying to figure out how I will feel with each option.  RIght now I think my two favorite options are just passing on the radiation and going for the reconstruction on the right side and follow up mammograms on the left or just doing the mastectomy and reconstruction.  Any experience with the radiation implant will be helpful.  Thanks so much Log in to post a reply",
