AllI could think was, \"please God let me live for 14 years to see my children out of high school\". I was stage 1 also. I'm here to tell you that I am doing GREAT now. I had targeted therapy (herceptin/perjeta for HER2+ BC) in the fall, double mastectomy on Dec. 14, and then chemo from January through April. Now I'm 2 months past chemo and my life is almost back to normal. I still have fear sometimes, but it is not like at first. The first month or so is the hardest thing I've ever done. The anxiety was so much worse than the surgery or the chemo. Also, at my doctor's suggestion I started on an anti-depressant. I think it really helped. I take Effexor once a day. You can do it. You will get better. You will get back to your old life. But it is very scary at the beginning. It's very hard for others to understand. But we understand.",

I talked to the 4 year old a lot about how I would not be able to pick her up for a very long time. I only laid down with her to get her to sleep, but I think I could have slept in the bed with her after 1-2 weeks. I used a lot of extra pillows though. It would be more uncomfortable with the drains but I think you could still do it. I had my drains for 2 weeks. Also, bathing my kids was difficult with all the reaching and moving my arms. I have been teaching them to do it themselves. I basically just stand in the bathroom and tell them \"wash your legs, now wash your arms\", etc. Then I only have to be involved for a quick hair wash, but I'm still there with them. Also, my 4 year old was VERY curious about my drains. She called them \"pipes\"! I was sure to include her and show her all my scars. I think it made it less scary to see it and talk about it calmly rather than keeping it all a secret. As I've said a million times now, having cancer at a young age (I was diagnosed at 39) SUCKS, but makes getting through it all easier. I have recovered very quickly from everything so far. Good luck!",

I did ballet for a long time, a little bit of ballroom, and have enjoyed tap for the past few years as a hobby and exercise. I am only 2 months past my double mastectomy and my range of motion is TOTALLY recovered. The tissue expanders are still a little uncomfortable but I know that is temporary. Also, I don't want to jump yet b/c of the expanders. My strength isn't there yet, but I've just now been given the all clear from my PS to start lifting some. I have been to PT twice and it was great and I will go at least one more time. She started me slowly and worked on my stiff side (side of disease and lymph node removal). I have always been a naturally flexible person, so I think that helped. Also, it sucks to have cancer so young (39 at diagnosis), but the good news is that I heal quickly so far. I think you can optimistic that you'll get back there!",

I'm in pretty good shape and am naturally very flexible, so my range of motion came back easily. But my surgeon is VERY conservative, so he didn't want me lifting more than 5 pounds for nearly 2 months. And he was very strict about which stretches I could do. The PT was great in helping me learn other things I could do and how to do them safely. Also, the PT was helpful in understanding lymphedema and she will be my contact if I ever think I have it. I'm very glad I went.",
