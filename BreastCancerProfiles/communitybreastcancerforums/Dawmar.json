Woke up this morning with a slight belly ache and again a severe headache. Some very mild joint pains in the hands but I am chalking that up to my arthritis. We will see how the rest of my day goes.

Last Thursday was by far my toughest day, it was 8 days from my 1st treatment. I had sore hips, and felt a little pain in the tail bone. Well as the day went on the pain traveled up my spine to the point where I could not sit nor stand still. I had to walk and walk and walk for about 45 mins straight in the office until the pain subsided somewhat to even try to drive home. Has anyone experienced this pain? My pain tolerance is very high but that was tough. Round 2 was today. I hope I have this constipation thing under control this time around.",

The MO and my PC are trying to push to have it done tomorrow morning, so that they don\u2019t delay treatment. I really don\u2019t mind a delay ; ). I have short hair now but want to get a pixie cut which I have scheduled for next week. Not sure I can deal with clumps of hair falling out. Although I have come to terms with eventually having temporary baldness. As I read everyone\u2019s comments my main concern or worries will be the side affect. \u201c The fear of the unknown\u201d. Because everyones experience is different. So my younger sister is getting married in June and I am the Maid of Honor, I told her I will be bald maid of honor and she said the make up artist will make me beautiful.
