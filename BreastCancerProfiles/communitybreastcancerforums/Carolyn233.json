Beesie:  My doc did tell me that I have about a 20% chance of getting cancer.  I know that leaves 80% of not, but it seems all I can think of is the 20%!  She said with the mastectomy it would be down to 1 - 2%.  She did tell me about a study that was done at the Mayo and I think it was 1500 women with Atypical hyperplasia that got masectomies and around 4 ended up getting breast cancer.  I could be off on my numbers but it was quite a significant percentage.  I'm very tempted to go to a Mayo doctor because it isn't too far from where I live. Thanks for the help.  I have a big decision to make.",

I have Atypical Hyperplacia, which they explained to me was pre-cancerous cells. My doctor said I have three options:  do nothing, take Tamoxifen or have a masectomy.  She said I would have to be on the Tamox for about five years, but I talked to someone who said that doctors are now recommending that you stay on for ten years.  Am I crazy to be leaning towards the surgery just to get it over with? I don't think I could deal with medication for ten years!  Just wondering what other people think..... Log in to post a reply",

The last one stayed in over 3 weeks and became infected and extremely painful. I don't mean to scare you, but that was my experience.",

I then had an ultrasound, a breast gamma imaging test and then an MRI. I had an excisional biopsy on 6/20 and they took out two lumps about 2 1/2 cm each, which thank goodness were b9.  I don't think you're being paranoid at all!   It's the doctors job to do a thorough exam, even if you're hard to examine! Just my opinion..... ",

My doc was able to make one incision and get both lumps as opposed to two incisions. It's still a tad tender mostly when I'm running, though.  Good luck.  Hope it all works out well. Carolyn",

Please keep in touch and let us know how everything goes.",
