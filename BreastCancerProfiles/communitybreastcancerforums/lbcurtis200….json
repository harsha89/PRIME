I have read some horror stories on here and some good ones.  I really don't know what to expect.  I know that I would prefer not to have the port, but if there are alot of treatments, then maybe it would be better.  There are so many maybes that it can drive one to want a drink. I am looking for all the info that I can get.  I am afraid of going to the doctor and not knowing what to ask.  I am afraid of not knowing the right questions or not getting all the info because I didn't ask.  So all advise, questions and info is welcome.  There is a major learning curve here since I have never done this before.  Sure hope to never do it again.",

Everyone at work is telling me to just be strong and have faith, but I keep saying to myself.  They aren't the ones that has had 3 surgeries and has the battle wounds to go with it.  They aren't the ones that has to have these chemicals pumped into them and watch their bodies change.  It is hard to keep a positive outlook all the time.  You go to work with a smile on, but inside your mind is racing with questions and the ultimate \"why me\".  Sorry....got to caught up in feeling sorry for myself.  All better now.  I will keep reading and checking back here.  It is good to have people to talk to that are going through the same things.  Hang in there girls, we will make it through this together. Has anyone had or heard of the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene test?  I am trying to see if it is something that is routine or something that you have to request.  What exactly does it tell you and the doctors?  I also started reading a little last night about the \"Triple negative\".  Does anyone have info or know of threads that deal with that.  I know I am triple negative, but what exactly does that mean?  Is it good or bad?",

Hang tough...we can make it.",

Well it is off to bed to get some of that much needed rest.  Then off to the doctor's office first thing in the morning.  Hugs to all!!",
