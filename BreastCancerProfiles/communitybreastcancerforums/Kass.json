      "Content": "Kass wrote: I received my us and diagnostic mammogram report.. Ill-defined 1 cm nodule density is demonstrated deep within the right breast. It appears to be smooth. No malignant calcifications or other nodules to be seen. Probably benign, repeat mammogram in 5 months. Birads cat. 3... The mammo report says 9x5 solid nodule with some increased blood flow seen in the retroareplar of r. Breast. Underlying malignancy doubted, but 5 month follow up recommended. I scheduled a surgical consult next week, at my request. No one has given me any info at all. Just a quick phone call from the ob/gyn nurse..... Am I overreacting by wanting a consult and a biopsy? I don't like waiting so long. No other history of bc in family, just dense breasts....I'm scared of the ill defined part and the increased blood flow.... can any one help me figure this out? Thanks!
