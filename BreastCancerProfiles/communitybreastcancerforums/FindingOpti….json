My RO wanted a decision from the MO regarding chemo before they began the radiation, but my MO appointment wasn't for another week so radiation waited. I would say you want to time the MO appointment to be soon after the Oncotype results are expected to be available and after the pathology from the surgery is available, perhaps 3 weeks after surgery.",
