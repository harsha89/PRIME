I have an appointment with the surgeon on May 17th, but have no idea what I am reading on the report, and my doctor has since retired with nobody taking over her practice. I want to be able to know what to ask the surgeon when I see her, but I can't compile anything without understanding what this report says. I am relieved that there was no cancer found (this was the only part I understood from the report) and thankful, because I am going through this completely alone. They biopsied 3 different spots on one breast with a total of 15 samples taken. The report reads: Microscopic Description A and B: Sections show multiple core biopsies of breast tissue. The specimen contains portions of possible fibroadenomatous lesion with hypocellular myxiod stroma. The lesion contains cystically dilated glands and areas of apocrine change. Microcalcification are identified within small apocrine cysts. Overall, the lesion may represent a complex fibroadenoma however sclerosing adenosis is not identified within the possible fibroepithelial lesion in this specimen. C: Sections show core biospies of breast tissue. The ends of three tissue cores show fibrosis and inflammation with a detached fragment of apocrine epithelium, suggestive of portions of an apocrine cyst. I will mention that I have to see the surgeon because I have an ever present lump that never goes away, even after the biopsy butchered the reoccurring massive cyst. Thanks in advance for any help understanding what kinds of things I should ask, and what this report tells me. Nancy Log in to post a reply",
