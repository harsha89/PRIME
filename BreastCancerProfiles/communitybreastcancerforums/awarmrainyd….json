The two tumors that they saw from last time have minimal changes (yay!) but they didn't find the other tumor at all and are now talking about a lymph node. Do tumors just disappear? I have an MRI scheduled for the 15th with and without contrast so that will hopefully answer any questions and put my mind at ease. I have not asked about seeing a genetic counselor, I've never really thought about that before. I just may ask my surgeon about that when we follow up on the MRI. If the MRI comes out okay I believe my next step (I'll probably do this either way) will be to see my gyn about the birth control I'm on. I've been on a high dose (Sprintec) since a miscarriage in 2010 and I've been finding more and more info about it's health implications, including increasing breast cancer risk by up to 20%. Considering my history with breast tumors already I'd like to get far, far away from this pill. Thanks again for your great advice! awarmrainyday",
