Just a tip. I also have my imaginary energy bucket (I read this in a previous thread and works for me ) that has to get me through the 4 to 5 months so I need to use my energy very wisely.  ",

For me the hair loss will be a sign that the chemotherapy is doing it's thing, but I intend to cut before it does shed, some of the wonderful ladies in the March group showed there new hair cuts , which has given me great reassurance.",
