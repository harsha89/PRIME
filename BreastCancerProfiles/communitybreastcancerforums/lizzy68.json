OMG is all I keep thinking.... I didn't feel my lumps or anything my OB didn't either. I had my 1st mammogram and then ultrasound I was VERY happy my Dr. removed both lumps instead of  just taking a piece... He used the words SUSPICIOUS so I knew... Now I find out what type and all on 12-31-08  Finding out early is so important, do you feel comfortable waiting??? I know I didn't and there is NO cancer in my family!!! I'm the first... So you have to do what your comfortable with... Please keep us posted. Lizzy",
