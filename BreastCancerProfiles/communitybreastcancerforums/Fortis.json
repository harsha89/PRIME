Windlass- trust me when I tell you that everyone has their moments of strength and their moments of desperation. It is a heck of a ride and all you can do is try to hold on as best you can and remember the sun will shine again. So, I had my LMX on February 1st which puts me 1 week out. Had a lot of pain with the drain for some reason, in hospital for extra 2 days. (so glad I did not reconstruct at this time) Drain removed yesterday and that pain is better, but today I tried without pain killers and it was a tough go. Now I have fluid buildup that I can feel sloshing around, so guess we shall see what surgeon says at next visit. 2 sentinel nodes biopsied negative (YEAAAA), but at full pathology the DCIS diagnosis changed over to IDC as they found 3 small (3mm to 5mm) tumors very close to chest wall (less than 1 mm).Sounds like radiation and/or chemo may be in my future. :) I haven't met with oncologist(s) yet, so just trying to understand my pathology report on my own. It is stating that the tumor grade is 1, with Scarff-Bloom-Richardson Score of 5. It is confusing as my Tubular Differentiation is 3, Mitotic Rate is 1, Nuclear Grade is 2 and if you add those together it is a \"6\"....so not sure of the \"5\" rating...maybe someone out there knows if the cancer-free SNB is the reason? ER+, PR-, (still waiting for Her2 results) Anyhow, I'm certainly having a lot more pain and discomfort than I thought I would (being the tough female I am), but just trying to keep taking it a day at a time and being thankful for the good things like my son coming home from college for the weekend to give me support and smiles.",
