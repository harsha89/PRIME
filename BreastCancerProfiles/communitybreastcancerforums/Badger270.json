      "Content": "Badger270 wrote: For the last couple weeks I've noticed a red patch on my left breast near the nipple and toward where my breasts touch when in a bra. It's light but gets darker when my shirt or bra rubs it a lot goes white when pressed and goes away completely for days at a time. It also shows up on my right but only once or twice a week. I've been concerned with it and am making a doctors appointment but I'm just wondering does this sound like ibc? I don't know if it helps any but over the last few months I have been having issues with my skin breaking out in rashes from a detergent allergy which is what I'm hoping is causing the redness on my breasts.
