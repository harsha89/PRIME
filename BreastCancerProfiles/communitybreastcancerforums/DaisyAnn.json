Someone had stolen her new implants! Evidently implants are a hot black-market item.",

      "Content": "May 9, 2009 10:00PM - edited May 9, 2009 10:03PM by DaisyAnn LAnna, I showered two days after my bilateral mastectomy with the help of my husband in the shower and a hand-held shower nozzle.  As others have said, \"Best shower of my life.\"  The BC told me the following morning the preliminary findings were negative for lymph node involvement.  This was confirmed about a week to ten days later in the final pathology report.  My BC/PS team required me to see a physical therapist prior to surgery. The physical therapist explained how to prepare for the surgery and what to do and not to do after surgery.  I was told not to move my elbows more than three or four inches away from my sides until the drains were removed.  I could bend my arms at the elbow to brush my teeth etc. but not much more than that.  I was told if I did move my arms more than that my drains would need to stay in longer.  Wishing you the very best, Daisy",
