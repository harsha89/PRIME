I just finsihed A/C 2 fridays ago and this pain just started a few days ago.  I start Taxoil this friday and from what I'm reading I'm not too excited about that now.  I was looking forward to it as it's the last leg of my chemo journey but it sounds like the foot problems and peeling are just getting started. I'd like to thank you for this thread as it did relieve my mind to know it is the chemo and not some other problem starting to rare it's ugly head. Thanks again Vicky",
