Hugs to all those have TX's today.  I know we keep saying this is doable and somethings we just don't want to do...but this will reap such benefits that it is a no brainer!  Keep it up ladies..you can do this and in 10-15 years from now we will look back on it like labor and say it really wasn't that bad! Has anyone actually shaved their head bald (like with a razor)?  I had mine shaved to 1 inch.  Then without any guard on the clippers.  The stubbles keep getting caught in my scarf and hat and would give me chills down my back.  I'd like to actually shave it bald and didn't know if anyone has taken this route.  Can't believe I actually want to get rid of what is left! We had a terrible weekend here.  I went to Walmart to buy 4 sympathy cards in one day!  My husband's cousin past away Sat. and then friends of our lost their fathers.  When it rains, it pours. It puts my situation into perspective though...things can always be worse! Take care...hugs to all, Chris",

It sounds like everyone is getting through this just fine.  Sorry to hear about those that have had some bumps in the road...construction crew is on the way to take care of them! Are there many out there that have had lumpectomies?  I have read on this board and another that a lot of people have had single and double mastectomies.  I am having chemo first and then surgery.  The doc said this would shrink the tumor so I could do a lumpectomy without being too invasive.  Am I missing something?  I don't want to be too conservative.  What are the added benefits of a double mastectomy vs. lumpectomy?  Not trying to pry...just feel like maybe I don't have all the info I need to make an informed decision. Its been a week since TX #2 (AC).  I still don't feel like eating...push myself to eat crackers and toast.  I drink, of all things, Hawaiian Punch.  It's the only thing that tastes good and I usually hate how sweet it is!  Calling Onc nurse today to see if I can take something different.  All in all, I can't complain.  I just hate feeling down and out for so long.

I am on Armidex now before I have surgery 7/7.  Anyone have info on this?  I've heard sleep problems and bone/joint/muscle pain.  I thought I was over that when I finished the Taxol.  Any better time to take it or supplements to counteract SE's.  I was taking Ambien CR during my chemo days to help sleep but hate to take it regularly.  Anyone taking Efflexor (sp.).  I hear that helps with sleep and hot flashes. Now, onto the hair.  I've been taking Biotin.  I've read Nioxin follicle booster helps.  Is this the same as Rogaine??  My DS gets married in October and would love to go without a head wrap or wig...even if I only have a pixie cut.

As for my surgery, I have one huge incision from my arm pit to my nipple and then all around it.  He does oncoplastic surgery so my breast was \"reconfigured\" and my nipple moved over to stay centered.  He said this way I will still point straight!!  I have all staples that look awful...just scary!

Had first Taxol on Tuesday.  Neulasta Wed.  Took Claritan before shot and 2 days after.  Had some achiness on Wed. and Thurs.  More hit Thurs evening and all day Friday.  Took Motirn during the day and Thur/Fri night took a Percocet.  This is so much easier than the AC.  I have no naussea and can take a pain pill to ward off the bone/muscle pains.  Hands and feet continue to feel like they've been burnt.  I just use a lot of cream on them to keep them from drying out.

Welcome Kellyless.  Where are you with your treatments?  We are on the same schedule...I have 2nd taxol on Monday.

Deb:  I am sorry to hear that you have to return for more chemo.  You are a very strong woman with a great outlook and will do just fine.  I too had chemo first.  It did not shrink the entire tumor (so I thought chemo was a waste of time), but it made it look like swiss cheese.  The path report said there was a lot of dead tissue throughout.  You attacked your whole system first, so you got some added protection.  I had one positive node prior to surgery...that's all we knew about.  The nodes came back negative while on the table, but my BS did not feel comfortable leaving them.  I had a full dissection.  The path report came back with micromets in 2 nodes, however since I had chemo first, there is not way to tell if I had more than that at the beginning.  My PS did not feel comfortable leaving the nodes.  He said there are 2 new studies on how many nodes should be taken during surgery.  The report came up with opposite results....so he took mine. I had AC x 4 then Taxol x 4 DD.  The A will not take long.  You will get your usual premeds, steroids, anti nausea, etc.  The A goes in by hand, the nurse uses 2 big syringes to inject it into your IV tubing.  You will pee red for a little while.  I got sick on my first 3 treatments.  I finally got Emend in my premeds and then took 1 pill for the next 2 days.  I did not get sick at all on the last treatment.  Push for what works for you!! I go for rad simulation and markings tomorrow.  My arm is still very sore and hard to hold over my head for any length of time.  I'm going to take percocet before I go to relax....don't want to reschedule!! I met 3 fellow breast cancer gals on the ship.  One is 21 years out..no recurrance, and other is getting her third AC tomorrow.  It was so nice to sit and talk with others that have been through this.  I guess I was meant to be on that ship! You are all in my thoughts and prayers.  Take care, Chris",

Also,  did anyone out there get staples instead of stitches?  My two friends both had stitches from the same sugeon.  I have cut from under my arm to my nipple and then all the way around it covered with staples.  I would think they would leave a bigger scar than stitches....",

Wendy, Taxol is much easier than AC.  It never upset my stomach so I could take pills to combat any bone pain.  I got Neulasta shot after each TX so that also added to the pain.  I would take 3-4 Motrin during the day if it got rough and then a Percocet at night...that took away pain and helped me sleep.  I would wake up paiin free and not start Motrin again until early afternoon.  I had TX on Monday's and the pain came Wed. evenings.  By Saturday I was getting back to normal...only a few days and doable!!!  I continued with the Claritin on day of shot and then 2 days after...that really helped even when on AC. You may get a tingling or numbness in feet and fingers.  It is not painful, just annoying (especially at nght).  I've taken a sleep aid (1/2 of one) for about 3 weeks now.  It gets my mind off my feet...if not, I tend to kick things to make sure they are still there!! Hope this helps! Hair, Hair, Hair, I started biotin 5,000mcg a day.  It was listed to promote hair regrowth.  Only $6.50 for a bottle of 120 and you only take one a day....pretty cheap.  Now I am looking into Nioxin.  Those trying it, do you do Stage 1 or 2 kit, or just the hair follicle booster.  The kits cleans and folate the skin and then prepare for booster.  Not sure if the price difference is worth it???  Where is the cheapest place to purchase, any suggestions?  Have a great day ladies.  It seems our train is starting to take some detours...surgery, radiation, and new TX's.  Our train offers direct communication to all no matter where we end up...that is so great!!

Deb:  You really need to have someone check your whole file.  The point of doing neoajunctive therapy is to shrink the tumor and attack you system first.  The onc should have been able to tell that the chemo was not affecting your tumor and switched drugs midstream.  I don't think he was following through very well.  AND having 2 completely different path reports scares me.  You need another opinion to sort things out.  I agree that you have a lawsuit here.  Someone was not doing there job very well and the only one that suffered is you.  Unfortunately sometimes a lawsuit is the only way to make them open their eyes that they need to do a better job. Raymon:  Sorry to hear about your husband.  Hang in there.  I know the more I had to take care of my family the less I felt like a patient.  Check on drugs fees...manufacturers, heart association, etc.  You can usually find some assistance.

I am so confused...again!  She said if I wanted mast. they could have reconstruction done at same time.  I don't mind implants.  Would they do TE's then?  Anyone have info on skin sparing mast. so they can just put an implant at time of surgery?  Not sure if they will even want more chemo after surgery :( Sorry this was so long.  I just feel like I went through all this S**T for nothing.

Glad to hear everyone seems to be moving along.  Sorry to hear of health issues with family members.  It seems like once you are touched with cancer, the more it seems to show up with family and friends.  I hate how many friends I have talked to that are experiencing this now or one of their family members.  IT REALLY SUCKS!!!   My dad recently completed 40 radiation treatments for prostate cancer.  His good friend passed away last weekend of prostate cancer so he is thinking the worst.

Had a haircut yesterday.  Not sure if I like it.  I got it shorter on the sides and back until the top gets some more length.  I think the back is too short, but hopefully it will fill in soon. Counting down days until NYC trip!  I keep watching what the rates are going for on Priceline.  I've stayed at the Hyatt at Grand Central and the Millenium at Ground Zero.  One is close to the action and the other is close to Battery Park, Ells Island Ferry, and Little Italy (great food). Take care all... Chris",

I do two sit up type machines, one machine for lower back...and then the #%*% eliptical machine.  It is much better on my knees, ankles, and feet than the treadmill. I don't where a sleeve at all yet.  So far, so good.  I do feel swelling under my armpit, but I can manipulate it to reduce it.  I go see PT in 2 weeks for check up, but she said exercise is OK, just need to increase gradually. My heart rate sucks too...resting heart rate too high.  I only have to be on eliptical for 5 minutes and I am past the 80% target heart rate.  I was hoping it would rebound faster than it is. I have carpal tunnel surgery on the 20th.  Put this off forever because I hate anesthesia...guess what...they don't put you under anymore.  They use a nerve block and you are just given a  mild sedative.  Now that I had my nodes removed in L arm, they have to put my IV in my leg when operating on my R hand.  When they do the L  hand, I can have IV in R arm, but no nerve block in  L arm so I will have to be put under for that one.  So much for putting this off...just more of a headache now!  I guess I will be taking lots of antibiotics to help reduce my risk of lymphodema.  If I can put off the L hand for a while longer, I  probably will.

Here are instructions of how I post pictures from photobucket. You need to create an account with photobucket. I have circled in red, things to look for. You will need to have both websites up BC.org and photobucket Upload the pictures from your computer to photobucket. After the picture is uploaded to photobucket, when you move your mouse over the picture, you get different options. Left click on the HTML code, it will highlight, you want to right click and \"copy\". Then go to bc.org and click on the little green tree, paste what you copied into the spot that says Image URL and then click insert. Usually, you get a double picture and some type, erase the type, right click on one of the pictures, and cut it out. You can then preview to see if that is how you want it, or submit it.",

I have a bone scan on Monday...some pain in my right hip, but I think it is arthritis...doc wants a baseline bone scan anyway! Take care, Chris",

I am still seeing PT for cording.  Seems like she breaks it up and then it just comes back.  I get some swelling in my arm, but it does go down when I message it.

I have given up Facebook, Farmville, and most chats for awhile.  I realized how much time I was spending on the computer instead of out enjoying my life and my family!  I had to cut WAY back!!  I still read every now and then to keep up to date.  I don't post often.  I am thinking about each of you and wishing you all the best! Busy cleaning house, painting, camping, working summer school, and vacations.  I am enjoying every minute of it!  Have my 3 month check up next week...praying all continues to the good!

It sounds like the 5-HTP is a good start....low serotonin can be an indicator for depression.  Depression saps the energy right out of a person. Low iron/red blood count also saps the energy! I'm not sure if any of this corresponds to the breast cancer, but getting one \"fixed\"  certainly helps with dealing with the other.  Take care....and KEEP TALKING to your docs! Chris",

Thanks for the prayers for the family...I know they are doing good things! I have been bothered with minor swelling in my arm.  Wearing a sleeve during the day (sometimes) and when exercising.  Doesn't feel bad...just gets me nervous. Dayla...how are you making out with your arm? Take care everyone....Monday is peeking around the corner! Chris",

Had a dual b.day party and house warming party at my son's new home tonight.  It was nice, but sooooo hot.  Then awful thunderstorms hit at the end.  Time to go anyway!!

I am also keeping my hair short right now.  Tried growing it out and got sick of the inbetween stage.  My hair was growing horizontally...sticking straight out from my ears!  This isn't the look I want forever, but I like it for now.  Maybe as time goes on the curls will give up!

Great wedding pics Beth! Rachel..I don't see Arthur's pics on facebook, but it sounds unanimous...he is a cutie!! Going in for Mammo and appoint. with breast surgeon.  I didn't see my onc in Dec. like scheduled.  My blood work was great.  I had just seen my family doc and then the BS in January. I didn't see the need....but boy did that stir things up!  My onc sent me a letter saying that I really needed to be followed and he wasn't responsible if the cancer came back if I didn't follow through!  As if he is responsible if I don't cancel appointments.  I have never felt confident with him.  I believe I will be switching after talking to BS tomorrow.  So much drama!!  I'll keep you posted...

Hope all are doing well.  I haven't seen my little Sophia in almost 2 weeks!  I have had a terrible cold that has gone to my chest and left me with a nasty cough.  I don't want to expose her to anything so I stay away...I miss her!! I guess I need to boost my immune system to protect myself from all the germ carrying first graders!!   Take care everyone.......",

My rad onc also only give aquaphor.  I get rads in the AM.  I use the aquaphor at night, but not sure when to use it the next day...not before treatment and not sure how long to wait after before putting it on.  I think I will try the aloe so it is not so greasy. Take care, Chris",

My rad onc, surgeon, and onc doc all looked at the swelling under my armpit and said it was swelling and would go down.  The PT said it should have gone away by now and is probably LE starting.  She said she would work it out...advised pain meds before visit!! I am scheduled for 7:15 am all week....so off to bed! Chris",

It is a hard decision.  I think in our minds we feel that not having breasts means not having breast cancer..it gives us piece of mind.   It comes down to a personal choice and what you feel most comfortable with.  Take care ladies...Planet fitness has now taken my rads time slot!",
