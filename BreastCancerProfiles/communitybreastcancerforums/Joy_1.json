I had really achy tenderness for almost the whole year, and my doctor told me it was normal and scar tissue was forming. for the last couple of months it had really eased off and I was thinking \"ah, maybe it does stop.\" Then last week I started having pain again. Not the scar on the outside, on my skin, but inside my breast where the deep scar tissue is. I really was sad to have it come back, but it helps to know that all of you are out there experiencing something similar and getting through it. I see my onc next month and am going to ask him if everything is normal. It's sort of exhausting to hurt all the time, isn't it?",
