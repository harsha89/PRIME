I've been talking to different people who have gone through it and there's a range of experiences. They are consistent about telling me to take the meds for side effects. They also say that there are good days and bad days, and that you learn your patterns after the first treatments and can medicate yourself better. I found it helpful to visit the conversations of the women who have been doing the chemo for awhile already. I start TAC every 3 weeks x 6 on 4/8. I'm anxious to get going and get it over with. Welcome Steph Rose - I sending you positive energy for your IVF and I'm really happy that they have the know how to do that. Your diagnosis is almost a perfect match to mine, except you're younger by about 15 years. I still haven't figured out how that thing was pretending to be a small tumor in my tiny boob.",

I have similar path. but had a larger tumor and 1 less node. I hope you are pleased with your new oncologist. Having confidence in & good communication with your doctors makes a huge difference. I had 2 rounds of surgery. 3 rounds of surgery does not sound fun at all. I know that feeling of dread, that each time you go in there's some new piece of bad news and your stage jumps higher. I was joking that I always want to get the highest score on things, but it's not funny. Mine finally stopped at IIIa. My second round of surgery showed no additional nodes-I hope the same happens for you. But I know that nothing is more reassuring than having the procedure done & over with. My next decision is how to have the chemo done. I was given options of getting AC every 2 weeks x4 then T every 2 weeks x4 or having TAC every 3 weeks x6. Which will be the best balance of torture and function? I got the impression that the every 3 weeks leaves you more functional in between but I'd like to hear from people who have been through it. Good luck to you on Friday!",

Of course, having cancer isn't exactly a soothing, calming experience on it's own. I'd call your onc and ask for something to help with sleep. I too heard the Ativan is good for that. I noticed I didn't get a prescription for that with my other antidotes. I'm going to see how I do, but my guess is I'll be making that call as well. I'm hoping maybe I'll have enough energy from the Decadron to paint my daughter's room the first night though-I like to make myself think that somehow there are some advantages to going through this. After that, I'll get the sleep drugs. Kalyla - you're not nuts, you're planning ahead.",

Your fortitude, honesty and humor are inspiring. Thank you for sharing your experiences, it's helping others also. I've learned that I can't know what to expect from chemo, just that there are alot of unpleasant possibilities ahead, and that the good hair will be pretty much history for the time being. I also need to learn about abbreviations used in online chatting. I'll start chemo soon & I want to ask for your thoughts on getting the AC every 2 weeks x4 followed by taxotere every 2 weeks x4 versus getting all 3 at once every 3 weeks x6. I'm sure there are positives and negatives about each option. Any comments you have would be helpful.",

I've got IDC, Stage IIIa hoping to juggle being a single Mom and working part time with chemo.. I have a helpful ex and lots of support though, so I'll get through. I'm leaning toward the every 3 week regimen to get that week of feeling a little better. But it sounds like the other, every 2 weeks, might be as good. There sure are alot of things that can go wrong - y'all are a strong bunch of women. Kimberly - I'm going to stock up on the meds you recommended. Thank you. Kathy L - I know the feeling - I'll tell you not to feel guilty & don't think you should, but I think Moms are just wired that way. I can tell you adore the \"little monsters.\" I'm amazed you're doing all that you are. My kids are preteens, \"medium monsters\", and less physically taxing than the little ones. I just hope I'll be able to cart them around to their activites and watch their games and such. Thanks again - D326",

Thank you for your help and good wishes. Kathy L - Thanks for visiting the April group-I'm sure that was helpful for everyone just starting. I don't know how you stay so organized with all you have going on. Preschoolers are a major handful even when you're feeling energetic, but they are incredibly cute. Kimberly - Thanks for the tips on what to have on hand. I added yours to the ones from \"chemo class\" and now have a lovely little basket full of antidotes, including the $320 per chemo Emend. I debated getting that after I saw the cost but I'm more fearful of nausea than any other side effect and supposedly insurance will help with the next round. CarolC - wow - how about a little more stress! I wish you the best with your ordeal and that it leads to a better situation.",
