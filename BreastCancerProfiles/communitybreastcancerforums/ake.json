I think I was just reacting to how she felt when she was diagnosed and remembering how I felt then. I don't feel any of those things now...I'm confident, feel strong, feel beautiful. But, watching the movie is kinda like seeing it all over again and I'm sad for the me that went through all that last year and I'm amazed that I got through it and I'm in awe that I could keep a positive attitude. So, it's not that I feel those things now...I think I'm just proud and sad for that 28-year-old Amy who went through breast cancer. I think it's still hard to accept that self...that part of me.",

Ok, so on the section \"Moving Beyond Cancer\" there was a list of foods that fight cancer, that have the highest amount of antioxidants. It's pretty much my entire diet. But, I'm stressed now because I heard that you shouldn't eat a lot of stuff with antioxidants during chemo because you don't necessarily want your cells protected (which is what antioxidants do). So, of course, now I figure I've kept my chemo from being as effective. Seriously, how does one keep everything straight? Can someone tell me to cool it and that I'm being neurotic?",

He and my friend, Beth (BethNY on these boards) were asked by two surgeons in NY to help develop a website specifically focused on breast reconstruction. THey have chat rooms and a discussion board and everything....photos, insurance info, etc. I'm so proud of my hubby for making this website and for Beth for now being the executive director of it. Check out: www.breastreconstruction.org :)",
