Yesterday I felt great (maybe the lingering effect of the steriod). Today I have some muscle aches, sore throat, slight tingling of the fingertips and my scalp is a bit tender.  The only kink on the day of my treatment was my low white blood cell count; no idea why it would be low. Yesterday I had to go back for a Neulasta injection. No real bone pain today. Was surprised by the recommendation to take Claritin before and after the shot.    All of that said, I really can't complain. Is there something waiting to sneak up on my and kick my butt? Do the SEs build with each treatment? vtEllen: I've not had any trouble with nausea. Had Aloxi (sp?) in my pre-med drip and was sent home with scripts for Compasine and Zofran. As a precaution, I've taken the Compasine the past 3 days but have had no nausea at all! I hope the same is true for you! ",

I spoke with a friend of mine who is a clinical pharmacist and has spend his entire career (20+ years) working with oncology/chemo meds and regimens. While he did say that everyone's experience is unique, he suggested that SEs from a 4x TC regimen are very tolerable, that issues with nausea are slim with this protocol, and the biggest challenges are with fatigue and blood count. When I read through some of the posts here, it seems that many are having far greater challenges. My first treatment is Tuesday. The fear of the unknown - how the SEs will effect me - is weighing heavy on my mind. I'm not sleeping well, have a lot of anxiety. How were you up to and after your first treatment. Does getting through the first experience make it easier to go forward? Thanks for your help! -Maryanne",

I am planning to work and am fortunate enough to have the flexibility to work from home on days when I'm too tired to go into the office.  Regarding blood count, my friend the pharmacist mentioned Neulasta on Day 2 but I don't remember my MO specifically mentioning is as part of the meds.   What about aches, pains, flu-like symptons? Any experience with these side effects?   I'm glad to hear good stories about the SEs and am so glad to hear that so many dealing with this disease are doing well. Thanks! ",

A girlfriend of mine who has been through this (unfortunately) suggested that I sleep in a hairnet to minimize hair loss overnight, use a wide-toothed comb and skip my daily washings. Whether or not it helps me hold on until Wednesday remains to be seen, but I'll try anything! I thought hard about just letting it fall out on it's own versus the pre-emptive head shave - I decided that I'm probably not strong enough to see it fall out. Either way it's not easy! I think tomorrow I'm wearing a baseball cap to work - OY! Madismommy79 - me, too! And I hope you get there as well.  Thanks. lstreett - Be sure to have something to eat before your treatment. You'll want to keep your blood sugar normal.  I had breakfast before heading to the hospital for my 1st treatment. In spite of that, my CBC showed low blood sugar and my MO sent me to the hospital snack bar for orange juice and a snack before my infusion.",

No nausea or fatigue to speak of, however, every day seems to bring about something new. I'm mostly dealing with skin rashes on legs, backs of my hands and fingers, arms, shoulders and I had terrible throat and mouth issues. Mouth sores and raw throat were painful - thankfully a call to my MO resulted in a prescription for \"Magic Mouthwash.\" It's terrible going down, but provided overnight relief! Yesterday (Day 12), my hair officially started falling out. I have 2 wigs ready and an appointment on Wednesday this week to have it all shaved off. I'm hoping I can hold on to most of it enough to make it through the next 4 days. Terrified of this part, of course.   My golden retriever provided some comic relief the other day though.  She saw the wigs on their stands on the dresser and immediately went in to guard dog mode with growling and barking. Poor thing probably thought there were 2 strangers in the room! Thankfully a supervised sniff of both wigs settled her down. I don't have any children and can only imagine how difficult it is to take your children on this journey with you and want to keep them safe and protected. I am an ony child - telling my mother was the hardest part for me and I struggled over it for days before finally talking to her. While I understand that it is different with kids based on their ages, sometimes we take for granted how strong those who love us really are.  I have read posts here from so many brave women and find so much of what is shared to be encouraging. Thanks to all. ",
