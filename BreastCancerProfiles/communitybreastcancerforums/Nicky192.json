Grandmother and 90% of my aunts had breast cancer! men also had cancer of some form (Lung/stomach/throat) Anyways......about a month ago I had a very painful breast ~ found a lump that was about the size of a plum. Went to the dr ~ he didn't do an examination ~ but instantly set me up for a Mammogram.  I asked if it could be mastitis ~ he said \"NO, not the right symptoms.\" But that lump did disappear  ~ or so I thought!  The results from the mamo, (not exact) \"no leasions, but abnormal cyst\"  Dr office called to tell me that ~ and requested I get an ultra sound done.  Today the u/s was done ~ tech told me the cyst measured 2.2cm (didn't give exact measurements) ~ now I wait! Not sure of next steps ~ I assume if anything possibly a biopsy/lumpectomy? The breast changed when I got that lump~ I now have a red, somewhat raised patch about the size of a quarter.  This is found  on the \"inside\" of the breast ~ below the nipple. The u/s tech was on the outside ~ closer to the under arm but still on the breast ~ so not sure whats what! Thinking if u/s comes back ok to do the blood work for BRCA1 and BRCA2 Log in to post a reply",
