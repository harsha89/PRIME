People are human and no one not even the best Doc in the world has a crystal ball into you. Focus on the 10 and 20 year survival stories. My own aunt was a 20 yearstage III survior abd breast cancer was not even what did her in, she died of diabetes related issues! So think positive and dont dwell on numbers faith is your best friend now. I'm in the middle of my ACT actually on the T for 12 weeks only 8 to go. Im scared too but try my hardest not to dwell or think negative. Karen",

If you could tell your story in more disscussion and chat rooms (everyone you can) I know people hear absolutely NEED to hear its possible to overcome the odds. Too many people feel the odds are impossible to beat and it is consuming their life. I hope to be just like you in my journey! Thanks for sharing.",
