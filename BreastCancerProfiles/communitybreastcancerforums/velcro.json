    "Content": "Mar 9, 2008 04:53PM velcro wrote: I have been experiencing tingling and a strange sense of movement in my torso, leg and arm.  It started three weeks into radiation and everyone felt it was unrelated to the treatment.  It is now four months since my last radiation session and the sensations have increased.  I feel likethe left side of my body is shaking and \"nervous.\"  I have been to a neurologist and had CAT scans, MRI and EEG as well as blood work.  Everything comes back fine but my l left side still feels as though there is an electrical current running through.  I am back to the radiation oncologist this week for yet another appointment to see if there are any answers. I am also having trouble finding information and everything I read indicates that I would not have this reaction so quickly. I am sorry to hear about your frustration.  Hang in!",
