I try not to wear any sort of bra and use a cami with shelf bra when needed. I'm a D so it's not the best arrangement but I don't like the rubbing against the skin where the rads are hitting. Does calendula help take some of the heat out? Whats the purpose behind it? Sita, I am left side as well. Breath hold is especially helpful for us to pull the heart down and out of the way. If they didn't teach you how to do it ask. I take a super deep breath and hold it while the machine runs then let it out and repeat for the next one. It doesn't spare your heart completely but does lessen how much gets hit. I hope this helps.",

Hopefully they will be good at monitoring your skin but it sounds like you're doing everything you can to prepare. I asked my rad team about the bolus again. In regular medicine a bolus is a delivery system for medicine. What the term means at SCCA is a little different. She told me that radiation likes to penetrate to a certain depth, by laying the bolus over me it \"tricks\" the radiation into staying more surface. So it's laid on me during my first two zaps and then taken off when they do my collar bone area. As an example, if radiation would normally penetrate two inches with the bolus it penetrates 1/3 of that distance.",

I've also heard any SE are cumulative and depending on many factors, such as activity level and skin readiness, some women hardly have a problem or often not until the end or even after. Here is to hoping we all come through with flying colors. Carolyn, I would ask your RO but I've gone through some of the other posts in the rads section here and there are some really good suggestions. I think personally I will try to use as much chemical free as possible like aloe or coconut oil. My sister in law went through rads a couple years ago and what felt great for her (very light skinned) was to use a cold pack or small bag of veggies as soon after as possible to draw the heat out. Probably will try that too.",

How it works here is you go to a simulation where they take X-rays both holding your breath and not to see the positioning of the heart, some people's hearts are already sort of out of the way. They but GPS transponders on your chest and take latitude, longitude, and lateral measurements at each treatment to precisely fix the beam of radiation and lessen the risk of any collateral damage. Pretty nifty really. They're also using a bollus (sp?) to maximize the radiation on 2/3 areas targeted.",

You should ask your rad techs about breath hold, mine do the markings during one before they start so they know when I am correctly matched up and they can start the beam. Mine is dose dense too though, maybe yours isn't and that's why they weren't as concerned?",

Stress does hinder our immune systems from working effectively.

I've done genetic testing for BRCA 1 & 2, also the lessor known link that hits Askenhazi Jewish and Native American women, and additionally participated in a study that looks at 25 more possible genes and ALL of them came back negative. This tells me my BC is more environmental than genetic but I still think there has to be a bit of both...a perfect storm for it to grow.",
