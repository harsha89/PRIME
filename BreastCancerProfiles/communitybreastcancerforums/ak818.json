I am now 24 days out and am just beginning to feel normal again. It takes awhile for the soreness to completely go away. I am still sore under my arm, but it is getting better every day. Movment helps with the soreness. Hopefully by now you are feeling much better. I wish you the best of luck!!! Take care!!!",

Your Sentinel Node biopsy, if done with your lumpectomy will be more sore, as your incision will be under your arm. MRI is not a big deal. Mine was an open MRI,  which is not claustrophobic at all.  The worst part for me was not being able to move. I had an IV in my arm the whole time, which wasn't that bad, just a little uncomfortable. I wish you the best of luck. My best advice is to just take one day at a time and surround yourself with support!!!!",
