This morning i also started having an ache in/near the underarm above the lump/affected breast. I checked the lump again, just to see if it disappeared (wishful thinking lol) and I was extra thorough and payed attention to the shape this time. It feels like a rather large dense part way in, with a part attached that comes out towards the surface thats hard and oblong. So not a round lump like i usually read about. Not sure what that means. I wish i had a fast forward button lol trying to keep preoccupied but still very nervous!! Hope you're all having a good day. ❤",

My breasts have always been very soft and no pain whatsoever besides during pregnancy. So these new symptoms and lump are naturally concerning. I probably will request imaging of some sort. Hoping its just issues due to hormones or something :)",

For a few months I've been experiencing a sharp quick burning pain mostly in my left breast, sometimes it travels from left to right and disappears. Also been having a small rash. I've dismissed it until a few days ago until I did a self exam and found a lump about the size of a nickel in the left side. The lump itself is not painful. I have an appointment in two days, guess I'm just anxious and needed someone to talk to. Any experiences to share to ease my mind? Lol Andrea, Mother of two wonderful toddlers ❤ Log in to post a reply",
