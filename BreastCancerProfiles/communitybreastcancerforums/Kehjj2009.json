My father died of Bladder cancer almost 3 years ago.  His mother, my grandmother, died of Lukeymia, but had breast cancer.  5 out of 6 of her sisters had breast cancer, and her mother died of breast cancer.  (so thats a grandmother, 5 great aunts and a great grandmother who have all had breast cancer)  I want to get tested for the BRCA but am unsure how to go about it.  I live in NY and have BCBS.  Who do i talk to?  Based on my \"family history\" do you think ill qualify for the test?  Thank you so, so much.

Do i just call one, or does my dr have to refer me?  (my ins doesnt require referls but i thought maybe the genetics counselor may)  Thanks!",
