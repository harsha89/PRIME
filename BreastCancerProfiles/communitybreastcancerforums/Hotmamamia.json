I went to the Dr. yesterday and he also told me I was doing too much.  It is hard to just lay around when you feel good.  He is not authorizing me to go back to work until the drain comes out...but I am tired of no activity, I walked 2.5 miles yesterday - I guess that was too much activity because you are moving your arms when you walk.  I can tell you that it is better to have the drain in than suffer the consequences.  When I had my sentinel node biopsy, I did not have a drain and I was miserable.  It was fine at first, but as soon as I went back to work, the fluid started collecting and I had severe swelling and pain under my arm and all the way down to my hand.  It looked like I had a baseball under my arm!!  I had to have it aspirated 3 times before I had my mastectomy.  Hang in there.  Slow down if possible.    Best to you!",
