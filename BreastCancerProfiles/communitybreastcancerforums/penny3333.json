I didn't want to do chemo at all, it killed my dad and I didn't want that to happen to me. My oncologist said my tumor was very aggressive (it was a 53 on the KI67 scale). So, I said ok. My first hair cut, I donated it for a wig. I thought I would be able to wait until a few weeks after I started chemo before I'd have to shave my head. It was less than a week after my first AC that it started coming out in clumps. After one shower I looked like a warewolf, so I had it shaved. In less than a week I was totally bald. It's growing back now and I look like a poodle having a bad hair day. The one thing I learned through all of this is appreciation for every day of life. I am greatful that I have the chance to complain about the way I look and what it did to my hair. What I pray for is enough time to grow it back to the length it was and hope that one day it will look as good as it did. The decision is yours, you will have support from your loved ones, no matter what you decide. Make sure you are doing the best for your chances of survival. Who knows, maybe one day there will actually be a cure. The longer we're around, the better chance we'll have of finding it! Best wishes!",

I had a MUGA scan before I started which he said was 85%. They did another one before I started my Taxol/Herceptin which showed 68%. So it did do something to my heart, but it's still in normal range, so I guess it's ok. You need to know what the benefits to you will be, what your recurrance rate will be with/without it, and get a second opinion if necessary to help you make up your mind. I talked to my surgeon and radiation oncologist, then made up my mind. Best wishes!",

I was affraid the 4th cycle would have killed me. My blood pressure had dropped to 73/54 after the 3rd AC and I didn't think I'd make it through the 4th. My onc was petrified saying there was no data on 3 cycles verses 4 of AC. I told him it wouldn't make any difference if I was dead. I am praying 3 cycles was enough. I had my chemo in Decatur, Alabama. I go to have my port flushed in a week, so I could ask them if there is any documentation on it.",

My oncologist isn't helping my pain from the Arimidex and the left overs from chemo. I tried accupuncture, but that didn't help, so I'm going to ask him to send me to a pain center to see if they can help. Have your mom make her doctor do a bone scan, to make sure. Mine came back cancer free, at least that's how they read it. If the scan is good, he can send her to a neurologist.",

Thankfully, my SNB came back negative, so I only lost 3 nodes. They still told me not to wear jewelry, have injections, blood pressure taken, or ivs put into my right arm which is where the nodes came out of. I don't know if it was to scare me or if there really is a chance of lymphodema with the loss of so few nodes.",
