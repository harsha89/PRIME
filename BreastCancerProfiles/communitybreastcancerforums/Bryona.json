I hate that you are going through this, but you will make it through. zennurse, I'm sending extra positive thoughts your way and wishing you the best of luck today. I know it's scary to hear \"highly suspicious,\" but remember that they haven't given you a diagnosis yet because they still don't know. What is highly suspicious is still sometimes nothing. Having said that, I was actually grateful my radiologist told me my mass was highly suspicious. Because my biopsy was the day before Thanksgiving, I waited almost a week for my results, and while it was scary, at the same time I had almost a week to really adjust to the idea of what it might be before I knew for sure what it was. For me, that made things easier. Hold onto the hope that this is not malignant, but also know that you have the strength to face whatever comes. Bear74, I'm so sorry you're going through this. This awful, scary waiting time can really wear you down. I'm not an expert, but I can tell you one thing for sure: You should not apologize for venting here. No matter who started the thread, this is a place to get support from other people who know what you're going through. Even when the situation is scary, we can all find comfort in not being alone, and in being allowed to be afraid. If you're still having trouble with anxiety and not being able to sleep, you might want to talk to your doctor about some sleep aids. Your body needs rest, and your mind, too. Exhaustion only makes the waiting and worrying that much worse. Also, if you aren't already, give yourself a break from worrying by finding other things to do, especially something that requires you to focus. It might help. Ebby26, try to remember that most breast lumps are benign. I'm so glad you've paid attention and followed your gut on this, because your gut is right about the importance of having this checked out, but that doesn't mean your gut is right about it being something dangerous. And you're absolutely right. You can do this! ((((hugs))))",

Right now, I say your best bet is a few deep, calming breaths. You won't know what's going on until you have the tests done, and guessing and worrying now isn't going to change whatever the outcome will be. It's only natural to worry--I'm not suggesting that you stop, because I know as well as anyone else how impossible that is--but the more you can focus on other things, the more quickly the time will pass. And, the more quickly the time passes, the more quickly you get to the day when you DO have results and you DO know what is happening. And remember, while preparing for the worst may be unavoidable, don't let it send you out into Dr. Google's office looking for 47 possible terrifying diagnoses that probably don't apply to you. I know Dr. Google's office is extremely responsive and quick to get you in for an appointment, but he doesn't really listen very well so you just can't trust his answers!

A core needle biopsy is common and should provide the basic information for clinical staging. But I'm not sure I understand your pathology report. Does it say anything about infiltrating or invasive ductal carcinoma, or does it only say ductal carcinoma in situ? If it only mentions DCIS, that is excellent news for you! It would also explain why you aren't getting more information on grade. DCIS (as I understand it) is graded entirely based on nuclear grade, which would make your DCIS grade 2. Also, I want to repeat what fredntan said a few days ago: You should definitely have a breast MRI. If your breast tissue was too dense for them to recognize the original mass, they should surely use a more sensitive test to check for other lesions.",

Even without the C word, you suddenly find yourself with a massive situation to deal with, loads of unknowns, endless scheduling... Anyone would be stressed! But your docs are right: once you have a plan, it gets so much easier. For me, I felt better once surgery was scheduled. I didn't even have to wait until the lump was out; just having a direction and a tentative path made things so much more bearable. Also, don't be shy about taking some of those lovely little happy pills on occasion to help you deal with all of this. My PCP offered me anti-anxiety and anti-depression meds, but I said I didn't need them. I felt okay during the day, but I was in denial about how little slip I was getting and how much worse that was making me feel. Then, my surgeon gave me Ativan to help me through my PET/CT and MRI (I'm claustrophobic, and those tubes feel really small!). He gave me a few extras, too, and I finally gave in and took one when I couldn't sleep. It made such a difference! My brain finally stopped spinning, and even my dreams were peaceful. I felt so much better the next day for finally having rested. I've only needed them a few times, but they've made things much easier. And, considering how crappy all of this is, I think we all deserve for things to be made easier whenever possible. Hang in there. (((hugs)))",

It has a down side, because it's so sensitive it can find all kinds of stuff that isn't actually cancer but that docs will feel the need to biopsy, but I lean to the \"better safe than sorry\" side. It seems weird to me that your doc would make a guess about HR and HER2 status based on age. I was 42 at dx (3 days before my birthday--whoopee!), and I have two friends who were diagnosed at ages 35 and 40; all three of us are triple positives. A core needle biopsy should have enough to give the doc a clue, so my guess is that she has already seen that in the core biopsy but wants to wait to tell you for sure until they finish pathology on lumpie. There can be changes between clinical dx (from core biopsy, ultrasound, etc.) and pathological dx (after surgery), so maybe she's just waiting until she knows for sure.",

I still figured it was one of those better-safe-than-sorry things, but then she said, \"I can't tell you it's cancer until the pathology comes back... but I'm telling you it's cancer.\" And when she was done with the biopsy, she walked me right over to the office of the breast surgeon and set me up with an appointment the day my pathology was due back. As Beesie and KTGR have said, it is possible for the doctor to be wrong, but Beesie's right: It's unlikely. I had my biopsy the day before Thanksgiving, so I had 5 days to brace myself before I got my official dx. As stressful as it was, in the end I was glad I had that time. That little bit of possibility helped me to not freak out, and when I did get the actual diagnosis, I was ready. Well, as ready as anyone can be, I suppose. I'm hoping and praying you're one of the lucky ones. If you aren't, though, just remember that this is a great place for finding information and support.

As for your questions about how long treatment will take, some of the things that will influence your treatment time are: As for the question about reoccurence, yes, having bc does increase your chance of reoccurence, especially on the same side as your original. But how much of an increase you have depends on everything I mentioned above and on the presence of LVI and lymph noded involvement. Once you have the full pathology report, you'll know much more.

Keep that up; this whole thing would have been much, much worse without my chemo sisters. A lot of you have mentioned constipation. I started out on 500 mg of collace twice a day -- which is a ton! -- but still had trouble for theyou first 5 daysmonths of the first round of AC. Rounds 2-4, I added a dose of Miralax every morning days 1-4 and had no more troubles. The key is to figure out how long you need to medicate and how much, and then to start the meds right away, before the constipation starts. I started the collace as soon as I cot home from my treatment. Good luck! Heather214, I found days 3-5 on AC to be extremely difficult; work would have been impossible. If that happens for you, don't blame yourself. Don't beat yourself up when chemo knocks you down. When you need rest, rest. You won't do your daughter any favors if you spend two weeks recovering from overdoing it for those 2-3 days. Be kind to yourself. Also, in regards to your coworkers, a lot of people say, \"I want to help,\" and then wait for you to tell them what to do. Of course, it's difficult to tell them (requires you to do the planning and decision-making, which can be tough during chemo, and it made me feel guilty and uncomfortable because I'm usually so independent), but most people don't realize that. Give them the benefit of the doubt, and tell them what you need. Meals? Yard work? Housework? Give them suggestions, and be sure to ask that one of them be the organizer and make a calendar. I'm betting -- and hoping --for that they didn't mean to fall by the wayside, and that they'll be back on track with a little nudge in the right direction. Hang in there, ladies. You can do this.",
