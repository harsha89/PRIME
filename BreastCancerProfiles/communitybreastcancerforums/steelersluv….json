I was not a candidate for DEIP, but they do it in that office.  You can find their info on the Magee page under the Breast Cancer Program (left side of page under Specialty Services), then Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons toward the bottom of the page in the \"Our Experts\" link (I can't get a link to post).  Dr. Gimble is in the same office as Dr. DeLaCruz.  ",

I can tell you I feel tons better since it has gone down. I still haven't found the perfect sleeping set-up yet.  I spent 3 weeks in the recliner and now try the bed with a large mountain of pillows all over the place!",

I had full node dissection as opposed to just SNB, but I would guess it could happen with a SNB as well.  My SNB side is just about normal. You should consider asking for a referral to a lymphadema physical therapy specialist if you have concerns to get it checked out. ",

My muscle is tight, so they only put 40cc in mine at a time, and I don't feel bad at all.  I won't see the MO until the 12th, but they have told me to expect chemo and a port due to the one node and lousey veins.  They also expect the MO to request a PET scan, so it is nice to hear Digital Cowgirl got through it well.  How long did it take?  I also got a physical therapy referral to the lymphedema specialist to try to work on the stiffness and swelling on the left side.  Figures that I can't feel most of my arm on that side, but the port area is the one area that isn't numb!  I'm still happy to be moving along in the process now.",

Being a back sleeper will definitely help you.  I did wake up from surgery with a catheter.  They removed it very early the next morning.  I asked to have it out the first evening, but they suggested waiting because with all the IV's, needing to go to the rest room frequently could be an issue.  It's also difficult to go when you first get it out sometimes. ",

She felt the failure rate was decreased this way. I got a minor incision infection because my counts were still down, but didn't have significant complications.  However, after rads, the scar tissue increased to the point of ultimately causing a frozen shoulder (the worst was the lymph node area, but around the implant too).  I've been working with my LE therapist for several months to try to break up the scar tissue, but have had only slight progress.  The scar tissue causes a good bit of pain, and the therapist thinks I may ultimately need to reduce the size of the implant and have some of the scar tissue removed.  The non-radiated side is great, but would also need reduced for symmetry.  I've had a lot of surgery in the past 2 years, so I'm riding out the therapy for a bit and consulting the PS this summer. I guess the radiation is just very hard on the healthy tissues. By having exchange before rads, the skin does seem to heal better after surgery, but the overall tissue damage is still an issue. ",
