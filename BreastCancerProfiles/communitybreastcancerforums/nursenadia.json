Its the hair on the chin I could have done with out. Pre treatments I had lots of very fine hair no curls now I have lots of dry curlyish hair go figure ! I no longer look KGB like. I've been called sir but that's OK I'm getting \"curls\" I'll show them. I never could stand stuff on my head so I opted out of the wig and used a bandanna when in public.

No alcohol cause it drys up skin. Fragrance free cause some fragrances can irritate. I've heard that using the actual aloe Vera leaf is good to use ( don't use if already allergic) and its natural",

So delays and two more simulations later its finaly started. While getting \"measured\" I kept hearing \"inf\" thought I was a fairy princess from lord of the rings. My friend also getting rad treatments kept hearing \"sup\" and wondered if they were going to get soup. I finally put my nurses cap and figured it out inf=inferior and sup= superior. My friend and I had a good laugh. No princess for me and \"no soup \" for her. Now my treatments and planning were taking at least 45 min I was getting cold with both \"arms in the air \" and shaking making  treatments hard for tech's to do blankets didn't help. So I bought a pair of knee high socks at Walmart cut the toe part off and used them as sleeves. That did it ,no more shaking. And I'm warm. Also 45 min not moving made my heels sore and numb a few times so I bought a small dish drying mat to put under my heals. That worked too. Hope some of this may help someone.  Hope this is the right place to post",
