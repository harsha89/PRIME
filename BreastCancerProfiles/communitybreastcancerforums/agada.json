The docs found my cancer by mistake when I was taken to the ER with chest pains. They did a CT scan and found small enlarged lymph nodes and suggested a follow up on them, which I did. That was when they found the DCIS.  I am not saying you have cancer, but if you have an infected lymph node you might as well take care of it and a sore breast can be refered pain.  Its worth treating just to get rid of the pain.

Also, sometimes things come back inconclusive due to interfering substances and not gettting enough cells to work with. This can also extend the time it takes for you to get your results back.....or the lab has a back log of specimens. Agada",
