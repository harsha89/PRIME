For the last 7 years they have come back normal except this last one.  On Monday morning I received a call 2 days after my test to come back  for further testing which is on December 29th. I am very small breasts and have not felt any lumps.  I was told that it showed Focal Assymetical Density on my left upper breast.  Last year this area was clear on my Mammogram. I recently had my Mirena IUD removed after a year of use as I had terrible side effects. One of the warnings on this is increase risk of Breast Cancer. I am a little worried! Log in to post a reply",

I have been doing a lot of reading and a little confused. Many saying they found a lump and some have not but still diagnosed with BC. Is BC most often a lump or is a mass common also?
