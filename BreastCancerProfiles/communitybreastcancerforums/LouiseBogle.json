I have treatment about once a month, I write off 7-10 days and then fill my time with as much tennis and as little housework as I can! A few coffee mornings, trips to garden centres, family duties etc and I'm flat out b4 kids get in at 14.30. Then it's homework and after school activities. I wonder how I ever managed to fit work in. I would love my old job but it's just not feasible with the amount of time I need for hospital appointments and for getting over chemo symptoms. I don't spend all my time thinking about cancer and personally I love playing tennis, going to yoga etc..if you decided to give up work my advice would be to work at not working. It takes time (and I loved my job) but you can find a new routine and enjoy it too. Good luck with whatever choice you make x",

Sometimes I want to know the full details and other times I don't, I watch him trying to interpret me while I do the same with him (my hubbie looks on watching me watching him watching me!). Yesterday for example I got a bad scan result with progression in the liver, almost as I was walking out the door, and only when I asked about other organs did I find out that I had a small area of fluid in one lung sac. Does this mean I have pleural effusion? I start a new chemo, myocet which is doxirubicon in the next week or so. Help what does this mean?! Will I be ok? Despite the scans I am strong and do some form of physical activity most days and still don't think I look like I'm ill.

God I sound like a really depressing character! I live a relatively normal life (aside from almost weekly hospital appointments) and so far being sick, hasn't got me out of ironing, cooking, cleaning or any other domestic duties! I was a sales director for a large media company but I quit when I was diagnosed and I'm really glad I did. Money is tight but the lack of stress and time to indulge in tennis, yoga and baking more than compensates.

Last week I read the most amazing article in the Irish Times. It's got nothing to do with breast cancer but the themes in the article are relevant to all of us. It is about a young film maker called Simon Fitzmaurice who was diagnosed with motor neurone diesese. As I read it, tears rolled down my cheeks, but it is hugely inspirational and incredibly positive. It has generated quite a response here in Ireland . To me, it's the writers strong understanding of himself, his emotions and the power of the spiritual side of well being, that makes it such essential reading. I'd you go to www.irishtimes.com and search for either Simon Fitzmaurice or Motor neurone. The headline for the article is 'that's the thing about your death, it pulls in all you loved ones'. It was published on 5th December. Hope you can find it x Dx 12/7/2010, ER+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I have been living with bone mets for almost 24 months and liver mets for 13. Ive just started my 3rd chemo and apart from some side effects from the chemo, I've definitely been living for the past two years! My son is only 10 but I think age is irrelevant, we all want to love and be loved. You never stop being a mum so I'm sure your mum will point you in the right direction. As much as you want to do things for your mum I guarantee she is still going to be watching out for you!

Well he made his last year, she made hers two weeks ago. Everyone said she looked fab and that I did too. Friends I haven't seen in a few months came by and couldn't believe I looked as well as I did (that sounds so vain, I'm not like that at all!) Bit of a Cinderella moment when I removed the hair piece, took off the carefully applied make-up, realised the nails were chipped and the fake tan was coming off in patches but only my poor family had to c that transformation!! I suppose I'm just saying between one year and the next, I had my ups and downs but I made it and most of the time I was well and happy. Our oncologists are heading to Chicago this week so hopefully they will come pack with armfuls of treatments and plans to keep us all in good shape so we can do all the things we want with our families. Enjoy the pure loveliness of your 4 year old, I have an almost 9 year old who thinks she's 19, everything's for babies and wants me to buy her cool clothes because I know nothing about fashion!
