I have been on weekly taxol for my mets for over 2 years. It has kept me stable all this time while being fairly easy to tolerate as far as chemos go. Good luckand check out the weekly taxol for stage 4 thread it's full of great info Edited to add I am starting a trial next week for an oral form of taxol called or or oraxel. From what I hear from others it is easier to tolerate than the Iv version.",

There are a lot of capsules to swollow though for the 3 days of each week you take the treatment. I am on a significantly larger dose of the oral than I was on the IV and have far fewer issues.

Perhaps your Onc could look into that for you. Although it's for different reasons I hate steroids to. While I was on the IV version of taxol once I had a few infusions under my belt my Onc agreed to start dropping my Dex dose till I was on none. Apparently it isn't uncommon to drop the Dex with taxol once you've proved you aren't going to have an allergic reaction. Good Luck Shazza",

I'm with you Amy and Steelrose on the first progression. Hopefully I'm still stable and my current bone pain is just old age. but I lost a good friend to this shitty disease a couple of weeks ago, then 2 girls from my support group passed away within 2 days of each other, then there's been bad news for several others. It all just adds to my nerves. The sooner it's all over and I can get back to normal life the better.",
