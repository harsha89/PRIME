They provide handmade quilts to Chemo patients. One of my neighbors is involved with them and ordered 1 for me, it is great about the size of a single bed it comes in a quilted bag with a pocket to hold book, water bottle etc. They have a website and there is no charge for them . The website is:: www.victoriasquiltscanada.com Just did google search and there is a Victoria's quilts in the US as well.",

I take 5 steroids 12 hours beforehand and another 5 6 hours before Chemo,  they give me Benadryl and zanax premeds by IV, I also get a Zofran and a maxaran (both anti nausea drugs) then the Taxol - entire infusion time is about 2 hours.  I do get restless leg syndrome with the Benadryl but have food keeping my feet firmly on the floor or standing and walking around eases it. Infusion 1 - only SE was numb toes, constipation Infusion 2 -  SE's - numb feet, 1 day of mild nausea, constipation. extremely dry skin Infusion 3 - SE's - neuropathy to feet and hands, mild nausea, tingling of scalp and hair starting to shed, constipation, dry skin Infusion 4 - SE's - neuropathy hands and feet, slight headache and hair falling out in clumps, joint pain, fatigue, constipation, very dry skin Infusion 5 - SE's - neuropathy hands and feet, hair loss slowing down, joint pain, constipation, all over feeing like I am coming down with the flu. dry skin Infusion 6 = SE's - acid reflux, neuropathy hands and feet,  HAIR STABLE AND NO LONGER FALLING OUT, joint pain, slight headache, mild nausea, 2 days of not feeling great, dry skin Infusion 7 - acid reflux, neuropathy hands and feet, nausea, joint pain, headache,  fatigue, dry skin All my side effects have been mild to moderate and quite manageable I have noticed that  when I started the first few infusions that I was amped up on Steriods for a few days before I crashed and the SE appeared, but now they usually kick in by day 2 after infusion and now last 2 to 3 days instead of 1. I have had no nail issues,  I did cut them quite short beforehand and they are quite brittle but that is it.  I did not ice nor does anyone at the Cancer Center I go to. Eyebrows and Eyelashes - have had no loss of them whatsoever  wishing everyone well Charlene     ",

      "Content": "Charlene1 wrote: I am so angry, I feel my body has betrayed me I am 60 years old In October 2015 I was diagnosed with throat cancer ( squamous cell carcinoma) after meeting with my oncologist and radiologist I was told a treatment plan of 3 Chemo and 35 radiation was advised, my oncologist also told me that we only had one chance to get this and he gave that chance 40% . because of the type of cancer and where it was located surgery was not an option. I started my treatments in Late November 1015. I had to be hospitalized as by treatment time I was down to 82 lbs and had to be feed through a feeding tube they inserted in my stomach. I completed my treatment at the end of January 2016. It was a long road to recovery and finally in June of this year I was starting to feel myself again and had gained some weight and was up to 104 lbs. Petscan in June revealed the throat cancer was gone!!! but revealed a tiny speck in my left breast \u2013 physical examination by 3 doctors could not detect any lump or changes in breast tissue. A mammogram was ordered and biopsy performed , it is standard here that an appointment be made with the surgeon same day as biopsy is done and surgeon will discuss results of biopsy. My appointment was for 2 weeks later. I did worry a bit, but was reassured that it probably was a cyst or such and if it was cancer I would hear from the surgeon before my appointment. So off I went to the appointment with the surgeon 2 weeks after the biopsy 99% sure it came back clean. I was wrong Biopsy came back positive for Invasive Ductal carcinoma 7.6 mm in size ER and PR positive HER2NEU \u2013 negative Treatment plan is Lumpectomy, sentinel node biopsy and Radiation plus hormone therapy since it is so small a small wire has to be placed in the breast to guide the surgeon. Has anyone else had this wire placed? My surgeon uses the TNM method for staging which is Tumor, Nodes and metastatics the tumor has been graded at stage 1 and the nodes and metastatics will be graded once the Lumpectomy is done. I am waiting on a surgery date which will be in late August or early September. I meet with the oncologist and radiologist next Thursday. Right now I am so angry and frustrated I was just returning to normal after the throat cancer and now this. Both cancers are unrelated. I know I am luckier than most as it was caught so early, but I am so sick of being sick and not looking forward to another round of radiation as it made me so sick the last time. I beat the last one which was a lot more serious and life threatening and I know I will beat this one as well. Thank you for listening as I vent. diagnosed 10/15 throat cancer treatment 3 chemo 35 radiation, June 2015 PET scan revealed throat cancer was gone, but pin prick spot showed up in left breast, and so another journey begins Dx 6/28/2016, IDC, Left, <1cm, Stage IB, Grade 3, 1/4 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Surgery 8/24/2016 Lumpectomy: Left Chemotherapy 10/5/2016 Taxol (paclitaxel) Radiation Therapy Whole-breast: Breast, Lymph nodes Radiation Therapy Whole-breast: Breast, Lymph nodes Hormonal Therapy Log in to post a reply",

The trips everyday for treatment are going to be a huge pain, last year during my radiation I was already hospitalized so it was a quick wheelchair trip down to the radiation dept. but I am home this time and it is a hour and 1/2 trip to the hospital so I am sure between the drive and the treatment I will be pretty tired out towards the end.

I had some taste issues and still have some but it has improved drastically from what it was, Ask your radiologist what type of cream or lotion he recommends for check the Rads forum here for some good advice on what works best. I was very sick at the time I had mine so some of my side effects were due to where the cancer was in my throat. You will be fitted for a mask that will cover your head, neck and shoulders, they wet it and fit it to your head, neck and upper shoulders then it dries hard - they then mark the mask as to where the beams are to hit, so no tattoo this time. The mask is skin tight so it is very important to maintain your weight also I use to take an ativan about 1/2 hour before treatment so I didn;t panic when they put the mask on. All in all it was not as bad as I thought it would be and it killed all the cancer that was in my throat and lymph nodes. Hope this helps Charlene  ",
