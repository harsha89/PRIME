I am doing a DIEP flap and can't do that until 6 months post rads. So I figured I should do something to maintain any level of fitness. I was very surprised how hard it was to get to my yoga class today. Usually I love to workout and love the high so I was so surprised today I was making all sorts of excuses to myself to not go. I felt good after and have improved some from last week but it is still emotionally hard.",
