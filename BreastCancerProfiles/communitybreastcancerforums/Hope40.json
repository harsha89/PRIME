I am scared as hell.  I feel like I can't breath.  I have imagined every scenario of what the results could be.  I keep running into people who have lost a loved one to breast cancer.  I hear their stories and its like I walk around thinking, when is my time coming.  I keep thinking I will look over my shoulder and see the damn grim reaper.  So yes I am being a bit dramatic but this PET scan has me scared.  Finishing treatment has me scared.  I don't know if I like not doing treatments.  At least I am doing something.  I have no idea why I got breast cancer.  What did I do to get it, and what the hell if I do it again?  I am so just not coping well.  I need some good cheer, and some hope!  Anyone out there with scarring and nodes where they had radiation that turned out ok?

My oncologist  gave me something for anxiety and it has helped. Just going to try and stay busy. Thank you all for your support, it has helped immensely having someone to tell how I really feel about things. It isn't always easy confiding in family and friends because I don't want to upset them. It's hard for them to understand what it is like. They mean well and love me unconditionally and I'm grateful for that. Now getting through the next couple days.. I will let you know how it turns out.",

I know all of you feel the same, and there isn't anything I have said that you all don't understand.  I guess I just need to know that at some point I can feel hope again.  I want to find peace and optimism.  I want to wake up and go through the day and not be scared.  Is that possible?

Somedays it's all I can focus on and I get sad. The days I stay busy I almost can forget that my body won't ever be the same. I am wondering if any if you have had any success with neuropathy pain. Mine seems worse at night when I go to bed. Some weeks worse than others. I take ibuprofin and it helps some but so far nothing else seems to do much. I am not on Tomoxifin I was only Her2 so I had Herceptin for one year. My body has been through so much I don't know what is a concern and what's just \"new normal\". I am taking my kids to Disneyland next week and I'm excited and I'm glad to do something fun. I am approaching two years and it still feels like yesterday I was told I had cancer. It's a hard time and I'm so thankful I have all of you to talk to and share with, it means a lot",
