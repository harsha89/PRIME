I donated the wigs and wig stands at my local cancer support center, they were so happy :) I feel much better now, giving away the \"security blanket\" will help me find a new normal hair-wise I think. seq24 yes, my hair started growing around taxol #7 (should be right around the first photo above), all the photos without dates on them were taken weekly after noticing a stubble. The first one with a date is 1 week PFC and so on. My hair didn't thin or fall out once it started growing but my brows and lashes did. They've grown back now though, seemingly overnight.Do you still have your lashes and brows?",

I started after my final chemo, not sure how much it helped with the hair but my nails are doing great! I also use the curly girl method, i.e. sulfate free shampoo and conditioner in case I do get chemo curls. Logang thanks! Merry Christmas to you too!",

Others on this board have reported thinning every 3 months for a while if I remember correctly. Apparently lashes and brows renew every 3 months, so when they all come in at once after chemo they will also renew at the same time. This should normalise at some point later on.",

I want to thank all ladies (and the few gentlemen) for posting pictures, kind words and encouragement. With my chemo, surgery and most of rads behind me, I am joining you ladies because I wanted to give newcomers to this thread a timeline of my hair growth. I'm not going to lie, seeing my bald head every day was nerve wrecking\u2026 What helped me was reading about all of you going through this, seeing your progress over the years and helping each other stay positive. Thank you all!   My hair started growing 7 weeks into Taxol! Top came in later for me. 9/29 was the first week PFC. I am now 12 weeks PFC and have started going topless. It's cold but oh so great....only had 2 sliiiiight trims to even it out.  ",
