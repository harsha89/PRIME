I am in Fort Worth TX and if I am correct there is a place San Antonio doing the trail.  I feel like I shiould do it but at the same time I am worried that it wont work and maybe I should do the current tx to hopefully shrink my tumors some.",

I don't know if this is similar to the trial you are talking about.  It had very little side effects and did boost my Tcells.  However, about 8 months off the trial I did have a reccurence.....I was the first in my group.  I would still do it again though.",

I don't tell my husband as much as I use to, he tunes me out most of the time and the stuff he listens to he just forgets later on. lol.  I have a 14 yr old and 5 yr old. I don't talk too much to them about it.  They have other worries with school and such but I do keep them informed when there are changes.  When I do talk to my friends about it I try to keep it short and sweet. I like Fitzs idea about emailing DH updates.  I might try this out, that way DH can't say \"I didn't tell me, I don't remember you telling me\".",
