Egregious - I've not tried miaderm - my doctor recommended regenecare with lidocaine and it's not worked as well as I'd hoped. :( With only two left, I'm not sure if I should try to find miaderm or not although they say that the skin can get worse after treatment stops. I'm really hoping that does not happen to me! Do you get miaderm via rx or just over the counter? Suzyshackle - I've heard Vega One is a really good brand of protein shake! Salamandra - uh oh on the lanolin! I have told my doctor and he said great, use it! I hope it's not the cause of any issues for me. Maybe I'll stop using or research some more. Definitely no fragrance, they told me that too. Sorry you are so tired. For me, I was tired at first but I think I've gotten used to it as I have more energy now than in the beginning. I love what you said about if you can't be a slacker with breast cancer, when can you be!? I also debated on taking time off. My job is stressful and I just didn't think I could handle both at the same time so I have taken 4 weeks off. I go back next Thursday. I felt guilty for it, still sort of do, but I am really glad I did. I only took one week off after my lumpectomy and that wasn't long enough. Trying to learn to be better to myself. CHB87-I have not experienced chills - I hope it gets better for you. I have found I have more energy now than when I first began treatments so hopefully you might find the same! Prissy - I'm new here too. This is my 2nd post but I wish I'd found it earlier. Best wishes for you - i'm glad your path report came back good, mine did too and it helped my worry tremendously! Good luck with your appt. It was surreal for me but now it's just old hat! Kerlyn - it's amazing you are more patient now - good job! :) Joytxs - for itching I've been using Aveeno 1% hydrocortisone. It's helped although it just keeps coming back! Faceforward - love your story, thank you so much for sharing. HPFull - I took 4 weeks off during radiation - I go back next week. I worked the first week of radiation and have 5 days without it before I go back. It is amazing that many of us feel guilty for taking time off. I knew I could push through and work but I also knew that my health was my most important priority to me and I would not be able to focus on it as much while working. I am so glad I took time off although I do still feel a bit guilty. It's crazy. Love what Salamandra said - if we can't put ourselves first after being diagnosed with breast cancer, when can we!? Heather - I think you will be able to work out but you may have to scale back what you do...just do what feels good to you!",

My skin is still raw and hurting but each day it will get better. I found a little round lump, about the size of a marble in my armpit yesterday and am a little worried about it. I wonder if it could be swelling or something related to the lymph nodes being removed? ðŸ˜³ Dani-I hear you about the armpit! Dang, mine hurts so bad, I\u2019m so over it! Hang in there. Deedee-did you think of something to do to celebrate when you finish? I\u2019m sorry you had a bad day, I had one of those too where I just broke down. I felt terrible but it passed. Yesterday was a pretty good day. Today I\u2019m hurting some but hope it gets better. The whole pain thing with this has been surprising to me too, my skin has not liked itnone bit! I thought my biggest problem would be fatigue I\u2019d take the fatigue over the skin issues for sure. Hang in there! CHB87-did you ask about the machine making noise? That does seem odd!! Wishing you all a good day ",

Hopefully my dx shows up below correctly! I wasn\u2019t sure if my cancer is stage 1A or 1B as the doctor just said stage 1. Anyway-I have 4 more days of radiation left. Yay! Just the boost so not the entire breast-my tumor was on the left side of my left breast so it\u2019s focused there for these last few treatments. My biggest issue has been skin issues. The pain on my nipple has been almost unbearable. The dr gave me a rx for Tylenol 3 last week and that has helped. I was hoping the boost would miss my nipple but unfortunately it hits it. I have tried eucrin, aloe, Buddha butter, a rx with lidocaine and CBD salve. Nothing has helped the pain much except I recently got lanolin, which is what breastfeeding moms use, and that seems to to help. I\u2019m really trying to focus on being positive and get past this week and next and hopefully my skin will be heading back to normal but I\u2019ve been told that it may get worse for a few weeks after treatment. I\u2019m worried about that for sure! Looking forward to connecting with everyone",

My doc gave me the option of a longer period-33 days or a shorter, more intense time of 21 days. He said he\u2019s found those doing 21 days seem to do a bit better with SEs. I am still having skin issues, unfortunately and wonder if I had done the longer but less intense period if it would have been better. I\u2019m hoping yesterday maybe was the peak of it and it will start getting better now vs worse. I know it can be bad for a couple weeeks after it\u2019s done but I\u2019m trying to make mind over matter work! Sometimes it does but sometimes not so much. :) I am going back to work on Thursday either way I think the distraction will help. It\u2019s been surreal to think of myself as a cancer patient as well. I feel so lucky to have caught this early and not have had to do chemo that it doesn\u2019t really feel like I do have cancer. Actually now that radiation is over, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m considered as having cancer anymore per my onc so that is great!! Now onto Tamoxifen-hopefully the SE\u2019s are minimal as I truly hope to never ever have to do this again ",
