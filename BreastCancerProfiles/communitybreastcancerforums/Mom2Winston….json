My nipples and areola are the same color as before the surgery but in a different position, more sideways than forward facing. They do seem to want to be erect all the time but I have very small nipples so I don't think that will be too much of an issue. I'm glad to be able to keep them. I didn't have to do the Nitrobid.",

For me, since I had small breasts and the tumor was pretty big, I elected to do the mastectomy with immediate implant placement reconstruction. My mom had DCIS and she did the lumpectomy followed by radiation and hormone therapy. I may be too soon out of my surgery, but having implants in has not been a fun ride. The pain is not unbearable, I am only taking a couple of advils a day, but there is a lot of chest tightness and no matter how good your plastic surgeon is, the implants just don't feel and look like your natural boobs. And there could be further surgeries down the road. If I had bigger breasts, and no thyroid nodules( so wanted to avoid radiation so they don't turn cancerous) , I would have probably elected to do a lumpectomy instead. Recovery wold be much faster and you don't have to deal with implants and the problems that go with them. Of course, you could choose not to do implants after a mastectomy as well.",
