One day, a pink ribbon will only belong on a little girl's head, and not a safety pin. One day, cancer will just be another astrological sign, and not a devastating disease. I wish one day was TODAY.\" by Naz Banoo P. Love to all. Every time you feel lost, alienated, or cut off from life, or from the world, every time you feel despair, anger, or instability, practice going home.  Mindful breathing is the vehicle that you use to go back to your true home. Thich Nhat Hanh Dx 5/18/2009, 3cm, Stage IV, mets, ER+/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
