Now I have to go back to surgery to get my lymph nodes removed more and get a port. I am trying to be positive but this was a blow of disappointment. Thank you all for support! Lisa",

They took my lymph nodes and I got my port placed. My arm pit is killing me. Hopefully it will feel better soon. I keep trying to move my arm to avoid lymphedema. I will start my 8 chemo treatments every other week for 16 weeks October 3 and then do 6 weeks of radiation totalling 33 treatments. My PET scan did confirm I have other effected nodes prior to going to surgery so I will know how many next week. I also have to get a CT of my liver because they think I have a hemangioma but want to confirm. It never ends. It is like a roller coaster ride.",

I had fevers for a few days that landed me in the emergency room Monday for a work up but was thankfully ok. This experience has been an emotional and physical roller coaster unlike any surgery I had in the past. Still waiting to hear about oncotype but they said my lymph nodes are clear! My plastic surgeon said she might have to do more surgery because she doesn't like how purple my reconstruction looks. Not sure what that means but will know more by the end of next week. Any one have a clue what she means but too dark? Trying to take one day at a time. I am glad everyone is doing well.",

When I went for diagnostic mammogram they said it was still hard to see because of dense breast. I then had MRI and I have 2.4 cm IDC mass. I am having double mastectomy August 24. I am ER positive PR negative and after additional testing I am HER negative from ultrasound biopsy. So that can change results at surgery? It will be interesting to see if they find anything else or lymph node involvement. That and oncotype will be the deciding factor if chemo is needed. I hate waiting for answers. Ugh",
