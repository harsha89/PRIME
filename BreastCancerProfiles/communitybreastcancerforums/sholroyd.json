Liezel, Tina, how's things? Speak soon - I am off up the wooden hill now (our saying here for going to bed).

I have had a barrage of tests this week.  CT scan, bloods to make sure I am up for this planned reconstruction op on Thursday.  Susan my urine sample showed up that I am a passive smoker - they would not do the op if I was still smoking.  I just about reached the weight they advised me to 82 kgsm (phew) - all so very hard.   I have also had my \u2018normal' checks and all my bloods are fine, I am due for a bone density scan but nor until July for mammogram - I only get one every 2 years - any value in getting one done privately do you think?   I am not being seen again for 12 month. Susan - how go things? Well I have taken a sleeping tablet tonight so my spelling is probably awful and my words may well not make sense.  I am so bogged down with work qt the moment I really need a good night's sleep so I can get up early and get on.  I am getting quit excited now at the prospect of a new boobie. Nicole - good news but great that you asked for 3 months check and not 6.  Speak soon Sandra from the UK",

Peg, when I log on I always get your very first post - you said \"..and I don't have an Oncologist yet....\" - 3 long years ago - we have all come through so much. Tina - how's things?? A friend brought a friend of hers to 'view' my finished product as she was considering reconstruction - I bared all and had to smile when I saw my friend's face - her jaw had dropped and I politely told her to 'shut her mouth' - she couldn't believe what she was seeing - I mean the good job my surgeon had made :-).  I was concerned for her friend though as she was a grade 3 with 13 lymph nodes affected - she was diagnosed about 2½ years ago but is doing really well. Well my life is back to being busy, busy.  We have two Spanish boys staying with us - they have been here two weeks (of 3 weeks) and they are fabulous and fun to have around - very respectful and they seem happy with us.  They are 19 and 20 have asked if they can cook us a meal on Tuesday - should be interesting.

Susan, your life sounds awful at the moment watching and helping with your sister's treatment - my kid has come back home too, she has asked if she can come home for about 6 months - she is renting her house out with a view to getting some money together to travel - like you we are not doing so bad at \u2018adjusting' but I (and am sure my daughter does too) bite my lip and count to ten - just how she does the washing drives me mad.  I have our yearly Spanish student coming to stay on 22 July for 3 weeks so I am going to have a really busy household again  - hope I am not worn out and manage to enjoy the situation. Leanne, I feel having my boob (or something very similar - LoL) back will help me move on - that's the plan. Tina, make it a pleasure to look at your boobies - give them a 3-year celebration pamper session - however you see fit ??!!!??? Anyway, I have just taken a sleeping tablet so am probably typing all rubbish now - night night, sleep tight from Sandra in the UK - here's to hoping I can at least bend down to put some washing in the machine or pick up aything I drop.

I am really very busy again now - said I never would, but I have !!  Still doing my 21 hours admin job, have added a little bit of teaching around it.  I am busy with a charity event that my friend and I are planning - we are having party up our back garden on 29 September - guests are being asked to come clothed in clothing from a charity shop (costing no more than £20) - a long term cancer survivor is going to judge the 'best value' outfit - we are putting up gazebos, having a chocolate fountain, pims dispenser, curry, jacket potatoes, holding an auction (decided a raffle was boring) etc etc - I am at the stage of thinking \"why did I decide to do this\" - it will be good fun and hopefully raise a lot of money for cancer research. So, I have been missing from the board for good reasons - and as you Susan the change threw me somewhat. Speak soon. Sandra from the UK",

I have had a barrage of tests this week.  CT scan, bloods to make sure I am up for this planned reconstruction op on Thursday.  Susan my urine sample showed up that I am a passive smoker - they would not do the op if I was still smoking.  I just about reached the weight they advised me to 82 kg (phew) - all so very hard.   I have also had my \u2018normal' checks and all my bloods are fine, I am due for a bone density scan but nor until July for mammogram - I only get one every 2 years - any value in getting one done privately do you think?   I am not being seen again for 12 month. Susan - how go things? Well I have taken a sleeping tablet tonight so my spelling is probably awful and my words may well not make sense.  I am so bogged down with work qt the moment I really need a good night's sleep so I can get up early and get on.  I am getting quit excited now at the prospect of a new boobie.

Peg, so were the stories worth waiting and worrying for??!!   I am sure you are really enjoying having your daughter back in the fold. It is my 3-year surgery date on Monday, which also happens to be my DH birthday.  No-one has mentioned 'it' yet, I am sure my husband will as he can hardly forget it on his birthday.  We have 2 Spanish boys staying with us at the moment, arrived on Thursday evening; they are proving very nice and respectful of our home and us - they will be with us for 3 week.  We had a young lady last year and it was very pleasurable, think having 2 will be easier as they have each other to go out and about with, although there are other Spanish staying in our village - so far, so good. I have healed well from DEEP flap surgery - still pleased with results, not back at work yet but have to see Doctor on Monday to see whether she wishes to extend my sick leave or send my back to slaughter! Susan, I continue to think often of you and your family too, as I do all of you.  Tina, how's things with you?  I do wish we would hear from our early day sisters.

If you still log in Janet, would love to hear from you. Now then Peg, will you be one of those ladies with their leg up on one chair with their top hats on (and very little else)? seriously though I am sorry you have also been hit by the recession - we have too - very annoying. Susan, I hope you are starting to feel a little more upbeat - I was getting myself in a tizz over my mammo result - all ok thankfully. I have a note that is Maxine's birthday - Happy birthday Maxine if you still log on. Speak soon. Sandra from the UK xx",

I have just come back from 3 days in London with daughter and 2 grandsons - had a good time and only got wet once (on the open top bus tour) - did Lion King, Changing of the Guard, eat at Rainforest Café - I PUT ON 4LBS!!!! (almost 2 stone though now).   I thought of you Susan when we passed Somerset House.

Calico sorry you are still having a lot of worry but know I am thinking of you.   Your daughter has done so well, with you firmly behind her all the time. I am feeling great at the moment - this 'time of the year' tests have all come back good and I just feel so on a high - I am spending money like mad at the moment - hence I have talked husband into going to London for New Year - I have now booked, same hotel I stayed in when I met you Susan - Strand Palace - very good price.  We are going to see Les Miserables and I want to be in Trafalgar square at midnight (must be mad).  This time will be good for us. Haven't got round to the horse-riding yet - perhaps I will go to Janet's farm??!! I sponsored Peg today and then went on to pay for a piece of furniture with the same credit card - the fraud squad thought something was going on cos of the US sponsorship and stopped my card - I had to sort it out before I could pay for my furniture ;-)  Oh well, who promised life would be easy.

The ladies night went well - lots of fun - lots of hard work - worth it though - another one for the memory box.

Tina, I feel things will be OK for Naomi, really I do - can understand your worry for her though.  I can't get my head round all those miles you do on the bike - well done you - how's the weight loss doing? Susan, I am sorry you are getting dragged down with this dam recession - you are doing very clever stuff, what is this new programming language you are learning?  I tried this once, way above my head!    Glad your daughter is happy and well - I also feel my son and daughter come to visit the washing machine, oh and the fridge! Calico, I can relate to sleep problems - never seem to have got my sleep pattern back - very frustrating at times - I am one who can't manage so well on little sleep. The one post that seemed positive was from you Nicole, hopefully things will continue to improve for you and this new drug will kick ass some.   Thinking of you often.  Hi Leanne, how's it going? Well I am trying to get into the Christmas mood - the thought of writing Christmas cards and wrapping presents (once bought!!) is not filling me with Christmas cheer!  Looking forward to New Year in London with hubby.",
