She was initially put on zoledronic acid,Femara&leupride as she was premenopausal. After a month this treatment was discontinued as she still had menstrual cycle.She was then put on zoledronic acid&Tamoxifen till today. PETscan taken on 30/7 showed mixed response compared to one taken on 1st may with reduction in some area & new formation in some other areas. She was given30 grey radiation in spine,pelvic bone&humeral head between 9&18 August. Another PET Scan taken on 30 sept,also showed mixed response with addition lesion on liver,although small with SUV of 4.5.it also showed breast cancer SUV reduction from 5-7.5 initially to 4.9 A doctor has advised oophrectomy & new hormone therapy which will be administered once/twice a month. Another doctor has adviced chemotherapy as he feels if liver is damaged further,chemo will not be possible. My wife is mostly a symptomatic & moves freely except some pain in the back& rib.she has not undergone surgery for disease so far. If chemo,then is there any less harsher new treatment? Need advice.
