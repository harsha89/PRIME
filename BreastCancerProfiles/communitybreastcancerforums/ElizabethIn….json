You had said that \"Dr. Ahn isn't under a specific plan, but of course the insurance company pays for the surgery, if that makes sense. The only thing I had to pay for, besides the hospital deductible, is the Brava itself.\" Does that mean that Dr. Ahn doesn't balance bill for the surgeries and fat grafting, or make you pay the remainder of her charge that your insurance does not cover? (Meaning she accepts what the insurance pays her as her full payment, and does not require you to make up the difference out of pocket.) I have BCBS, and she is not a preferred doctor, but I do have coverage with other doctors.",
