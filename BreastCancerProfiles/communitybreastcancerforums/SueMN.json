Have not scheduled the biopsy yet because surgeon wants MRI because of lumpy and dense breasts. My brain knows it is good to be thorough but it felt awful to hear that there are more tests and potentially more needle biopsies in my future before they even do the biggger biopsy. Feel like my frustration, annoyance and fear are out of proportion to this new development but am having trouble not feeling emotionally exhausted. And just when I had started feeling like I was handling it all well. Am trying not to jump ahead of the data and this site is definitely helping. Hoping we all get through this quickly and with good outcomes.",
