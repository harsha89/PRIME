I was amazed. I had a huge chunk taken out with three tumors. After the second lumpectomy there was a definite indentation along the surgery line, but it was not really noticeable. Get a second opinion, I traveled almost two hours away to have my surgery done as there was no dedicated breast surgeon available where I lived.",

Moth is absolutely correct. I work out lifting weights among other things three times a week for an hour each time. When I was going through chemo I tried to go as often as I physically could. The people at my small gym helped lift me up and after I exercised I always felt so much better. As far as you and your risk, I think it would depend on more of your families history not just your mom. Sometimes these things are just random. They did tell me that being overweight contributes to your risk. So if you are worried that would be one thing that you can control.",
