You have to find someone you are comfortable w/since this will be an ongoing experience. The surgeon should not be upset if you seek a 2nd opinion and if she is, you made the right decision to find someone else. Good Luck with you tx.",

After I finished antibiotics (for sinus infection), I had my appt w/ genetic counselor and Med onc, both said pain was normal and listened to heart and lungs and felt around the area. Rads eneded April 15, pain started near the middle to end of May, and needless to say I still have moderate to severe pain. This friday I see a gyno surgeon who specializes in fertility to dicuss ooph/ hyster due to positive BRCA2 results, I will again ask him to check it out.

There is also alot of cancer on my father's side of the family. In reading the literature givne to me today, I discovered another gene mutation(from FORCE facing Our Risk of Cancer Empowered). In reading the posts I noticed many were - for BRCA, however there is something known as Cowden Syndrome(it is inherited and caused by PTEN gene mutation). It links some unrelated cancer's together. BC, thyroid, uterine, pancreatic,polyps, lipomas(fatty lumps),fibrcystic breast changes. Families that have these cancers and test -BRCA should maybe be tested for PTEN mutation. This information can be found FORCE Volume 4 Issue 2 Spring 2008. Or you can go online to www.facingourrisk.org, or you can call 866-288-RISK. They are located in Tampa FL and have been around for 10years. I did a little research and found their website to be confusing(but I am computer illiterate) I just received this information today, so have not had much time to really look at the website. I hope this helps somebody, anybody!!!!!!",

Just as a spouse is not entittled to their spouses medical info. This is a very difficult time for your mom and she may want to spare you the details. When I first starting going thru all this I did not tell my sister, my MIL or anyone but my DH. I was scared. I did not want to scare my sister who is over 3000 miles away in Ca, she has alot on her plate. So maybe you should not be upset with your mom, it could have been an oversite as well. When I first started seeing the BS and all the onc I shut my DH out, I was so angry that I just wanted to handle everything myself. I did not want others to suffer my pain. I hope my experience will help you to understand your mom's a bit better. Do not feel left out, she may be trying to spare you the worries since a live in a different state. If you want ot have genetic testing done, you can. Go to your family dr. and tell him your family history and ask for a referral to consult w/ a genetic counselor. They will determine based on the info if you qualify for gene test. Good luck , do not be angry with your mom, this is difficult for her. I understand not knowing is difficult for you, call your mom daily and be supportive.",

I just skimmed throught the posts and let me just say this, nobody is allowed to complain about their football team untill they break the LIONS record for losing the most consecutive reg season games!!!! Born and raised in Detroit, moved to Tampa( at least they have one Superbowl win) but they have never been a good team. Work has been very stressful this year, I am already counting down to the end of the year. 22 days down and 165 to go. I should be counting down to the next 4 day week.",

Cathi, she lives on Bay Pines Blvd. Even though she divorced my dad and he since pasted away, we still keep in touch. She and my dad had three children. Her oldest son was killed in a car accident on Sept 22, 2006. My 39th birthday. He was born just days after I graduated from from HS. My stepmom is only 4 years older than I am, but we had a good relationship. She is even a friend on facebook. I use to eat at that Ya Ya's when I worked at the eckerd now CVS. Our Eckerd's are now Rite Aids up here in the Poconos. Have a great Saturday, the sun is shining all is good. Son has an appt for his ADHD today,yes a doctor's office that has regular Sat appt. works out great during the school year. Hopefully once he finishes puberty and his hormones are better managed he will be able to stop adhd meds.",

Bayfront  All Children's Hosp is great, and if your DD does not like that one, Tampa has St. Joseph's All Children's Hospital. I think a Level 2 US is hen the tech finds every major bone and measures them, they will probably look more closely at the spine. they also now have 3D and 4D US, where you can actually see what your child looks like. Prayers for your DD and he unborn child. BTW I have been to both Hosp and both are great. My son had surgery when he was 10mths at St Joe's. I was living in New Port Nowhere at the time. While working at Eckerd(which is no more) I was always involved in the Children's MIracle Network Telethon",
