I think I might like like there for two week healing vacations!  I will think of it as being at a spa.  Lots of hand and foot massages with thick creams!

I am starting xeloda on February 13th too.    I have to take an hour long class on xeloda before they dispense the pills.  The main thing she said to look out for was pain in my hands or feet and to call her immediately if I experience any. Now I am concerned about nausea. Will have to research that a bit more.  What did you take for it?  Any premedication to prevent it or just for breakthrough nausea....like ativan or compazine? This is such a fantastic site.  You are all so wonderful!  My oncologist is recommending I go back on Arimidex too--even though I am ER-neg. She said it kept the cancer away for two years and has seen that happen in other women who are negative. I was weakly positive for estrogen in 2004 14%.",

In my case, the pleural effusions were caused by my mediport failing.... It sounds like your sister is doing well.  She is lucky to have you as an advocate and for support. Best of luck to your sister.  We are all here for you and her.",
