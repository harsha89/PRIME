It gets real frustrating in the begining trying to get everything just right but please try. There are a couple post here about wrapping, maybe that will help. As far as the Jovi Pak you need to be seen by a fitter and she needs to take certain measurements and then complete the paper work and send the information to the manufacturer. My insurance company pays 90 % for my sleeves. I don't know the time frame for a Jovi Pak by my Reid Sleeve took 4 weeks to get and my Tribute took two weeks to get. I also have custom daytime sleeves as well and I need measurements from the fitter to be done for these as well and they take about 2 weeks to get. Unforunately with all the sleeves and such it's not a matter of small, medium, or large.  It's an individual thing. Hope this helps some. Maybe Binney or NPAT will be by soon and add more.",

I did and she showed me how to wrap with foam, did MLD, set me up using the pump with them, also did MLD. After about 3 months she measured me for a daytime and night time sleeves. She also set me up with the fitter where I would be getting my sleeves and future sleeves as well. At this point I had more reduction in my arm. So since I had the basics down and that I knew what I was doing so there really was no need for me to coming. She said the reason for coming was for me to learn how to take care of my arm. So from the first PT to the hospital PT I was going to PT for almost a year, although I took a break for a couple months over the summer. I did/do go back from time to time for various reasons and just to stay in contact. I did not see total reduction of my arm and some of us don't. A month is not very long for them to be asking you.",

The first time was for 9 months in which I wrapped day and night. I do get some reduction but not much and most of it comes from when I wear my reid sleeve. I massage daily and keep my arm moisturized. Wrap or wear a reid sleeve to bed, and wear my juzo sleeve during the day, and take the neccesary precautions. My arm which is my dominant right arm is still much larger then the other side - beetween the wrist and elbow. Even though is is bigger I can get it soft. I have been to two different lymphedema places, the first place for the first 9 months and then at the hospital out patient for another 3 months. The hospital is who fitted me for a reid sleeve and juzo sleeve. But they also released me once they knew I had the massage routine down. I had gone back to the first place several times either for what I consided a check-up a couple of times and then for ROM and fascia release after different phases of reconstruction. Each time they would also help with my arm too. I can't live in PT going all the time. I do the best I can and try to be very careful. I have had no further complications a side from an occassional achy arm in which I elevate and baby it when it gets this way. But my arm is stil much larger and I often read where many of you have had significant or complete reduction of your arms. I want to know your secrets. Please anyone?

I do notice when my arm is not as full I do not see as deep of a pattern. But a fuller arm or freshly washed sleeve I see more of a pattern. Now my first day sleeve (medi-mondi) seemed too tight and too short. When ordering and measuring the fitter asked about trying an oblique fitted sleeve with the silcone band inside instead of the top. Well the sleeve ended up being too tight and seemed to slide down my arm. So we remeasure (measurements pretty consistant/stable) and order the new sleeve adding one centimeter to the length, going back with the normal fit (I think) and having the silicone band on the top of the sleeve. Well I was happy with the longer sleeve but the fitter insisted it is too long. But she told me to wear the sleeve and wash each night for about five days. The first few days every thing was going well and I loved the fit and the lower arm where my LE is at was maintaing a consist size by the end of the day, yea me - lol. But about day four the sleeve is bunching or gathering on the outter part of my upper arm mostly near the silicone band. It's a slight bunch or puckering and I feel as if I have to keep pulling the sleeve up per say. I was doing a lot of moving and organizing but don't think this should have mattered. So I just spoke to my fitter and we are going to send this one back to adjust the length by the one centimeter but leave the fit and band the same. I am a little nervous about this because the bunching is slight but the length seems good. Okay so I look at pictures on line at how day sleeves should and should not look. The above sleeve looked like the way the sleeve should fit when my arm was straight, although with a slight bend I do get some lines per say. However the more I wore the sleeve I had the bunching or puckering. Now my problems with the sleeve are only on the outter region of my sleeve with the bunching or puckering. I do not have problems per say with LE in my upper arm. I also have larger biceps then those in the pictures so I need a sleeve the goes just below the axilla (about a finger width) and not higher or lower, sort of in between the picture of the proper fit and the too short fit. This sleeve was fitting this way at first. Does any one else have this sort of problem and what have you done to help this. Oh and do sleeves shrink? My fitter tells me she is told no but she thinks they do a little. TIA. Log in to post a reply",

If we are then would the medical establishments who refuse to treat our lymphedema as such actually be discriminating against us? I guess what I am getting to is things like fitting for blood draws in areas other then our at risk limbs w/o a fight or lots of pre-planning and such. I ask because I have a check up with my oncologist in May. I do believe he will want a blood draw done. But the techs will not do this from any place but the arm/hand. I will not longer allow this to be done any place but my foot or in that area after a flare up last October during a pre-surgical physical. So of course I am going to be calling my oncologist's nurse to check and have a lab slip faxed to me to have it done in an actual lab. It just at times, seems like it's never ending in advocating for ourselves for something we are entitled to regardless.

I am measured and fitted for new daytime sleeves every 4 to 6 month or sooner if there is a fitting concern. The night time sleeves typically have a long life and can be altered by the manufacture during the life time of use. These are not typically replaced as often as the night sleeve is. bingbing - I thought the night sleeve was close to two years as well. So I guess it does sound like my night sleeve should probally be replaced soon. Debbie do you wear your swell spots under your day time sleeve as well? I wonder if this would help having the padding day and night. I just do not want to return to the bulky dough boy look of all the bulky padding and the half hour wrapping schedule.",

I can't believe this sleeve has made that much difference in that little bit of time. By the way not that it makes a difference I also got my new daytime sleeve as well.

She said I should make sure I have the nice little pattern on my arm in the morning, which I do. If the sleeve is working really well and I am getting arm reduction so soon or even if it just needs an adjustment they want me to go back to my fitter to be measured again and then to send my sleeve out to be altered. I did get 2 CD's in the mail today with a warranty card to send back. For some reason they were not included when my sleeve was sent to the fitter. My fitter ordered two outter sleeves for convenience. I think I am going to wash it this week and see how it fits after washing it as well. I just bought a can of tennis balls for the dryer. I hope this sleeve is working because it is so much easier then the reid and circaid and of course less time consuming then wrapping. Here we go to a fitter who has to be a durable medical something or another. Most PT's here don't do the measuring for garments. But then again some PT's think wrapping is the key.

I am sorry you had to got through all of this but I was sort of secretly thinking of trying a different product as well. I have heard of Jovi Pak but not the other one you mention - TelestoMedtech.  Think I am going to do a search on this one too. Seems like our sleeves are not holding up in the same area. Humm sounds like a manufaturing concern.  I say this as I realize I did not check my sleeve and will probally just wrap tonight too. You know you mention your insurance company, it maybe worth letting both the insurance company and Solaris that given they have not delivered a product that is usuable to you that maybe the insurance company should with hold payment or actually bill them back for the sleeve you have yet to wear. Thanks again Binney.",

See I am one of the people who after a year of PT with two separate practices with trained PT's did not have total or near total reduction of the swelling. I did have some and my arm is stable for me. So there is not much time during the course of a day or night I am not wearing my day time sleeve, wrapping in my short stretch bandages, or wear my night sleeve with the outer sleeve over it. I am measured and fitted for new daytime sleeves every 4 to 6 month or sooner if there is a fitting concern. The night time sleeves typically have a long life and can be altered by the manufacture during the life time of use. These are not typically replaced as often as the night sleeve is. bingbing - I thought the night sleeve was close to two years as well. So I guess it does sound like my night sleeve should probally be replaced soon. Debbie do you wear your swell spots under your day time sleeve as well? I wonder if this would help having the padding day and night. I just do not want to return to the bulky dough boy look of all the bulky padding and the half hour wrapping schedule.",

That's sort of good because many of us needing the traditional custom sleeves need it because we may not see complete reduction of our lymphedema so we need something a little more durable.  We have a new normal of our arm so to speak. The bad part is the measuring, cost (if insurance doesn't cover it), waiting to get it and then the fact that it can be so darn hot to wear in the warmer months. Although much better then the banadges. My insurance company has not said anything about my custom day or night sleeves. I have had Juzo custom day time sleeves and did not like them at all. Now I have an Elvarex by Jobst and it is much better. I currently have a Solaris Tribute night sleeve as well sleeve. Much more comfortable and easier to use then the two previous Reid sleeves and the Circaid night sleeve. My insurance company has been good about everything so far. I do need to use a DME. I like mine but there are times where I think I need to find another just to make sure. Even though my night sleeve is more convenient I still will wrap on occasion. But I have to get those bandages just so or I find I am rewrapping in the middle of the night. Not a good thing at all.",

I told him one arm is compromised and I have to protect the other arm. That was when he was insistant about the BP. But I find this very interesting because I went to an urgent care place this weekend because I ended up with an offical case of the flu. The very young looking nurse comes in with her blood pressure machine on wheels and I told her no. I told her I had lymphedema and she could not use my arms. She looked puzzled so I briefly told her is she needs a BP it would need to be done on my thigh or ankle, but I would need to lie down and have my legs elevated for about 5 minutes. She was still puzzled but ask me to lie down and said she would be back. She did return and then asked me how she was supposed to take my blood pressure on my ankle. I told her just like on my arm. She had no problem at all and the reading seemed pretty close for me. Now this young looking nurse learned something from me a patient she may not even see again. She did not give me a hard time at all. Maybe this nurse should educate the doctor I am about to leave. I think maybe I should carry a handout or something. Oh my husband and mil both have decided to leave the practice as well. Seems the doctor gets a little po'd if you seek treatment with a specialist for other conditions. My mil, fil, sil, and husband all are diabetic. The doctor was upset with my inlaws when they informed him that they were going to arranging their care with a specialist. Too bad because my husband did too. I think my doctor does need an education for sure. He no longer makes hospital rounds but I am sure he needs to be educated as to why he will be loosing patients. I think the letter to the insurance company is a good ideal.

This was a remake because the first one had an internal silicone band (making it shorter) and an obilique cut which had the silicone band on the top of the arm but not the in the axilla area. That sleeve was too tight and too short. My clothes kept puling in further down. We did a remake (remeasured as well) to this sleeve shown. I asked for the additional length (one centimeter) because we were not sure about where the band would be place (sewn in the top or attached to the top). When the sleeve came in my fitter did say she thought it was too long. But since it felt better (thent he previous one) she agreed to let me wear and wash it and then call her back after five days to let her know that how it was fitting. I called her today and she was more then happy to have me return it to her so we can get it resized. I am going to call her back again tomorrow to see if we can't remeasure again since the sleeve is going back. I did print the pictures so my fitter will have those to send back with the sleeve as well. I am going to start a new thread to see if others will post pictures on how their sleeves fit too. I have been wearing sleeves for almost 9 years now and I have never had this much problem getting them to fit. This is a new fitter and she seems to be good, although does like to try to sell other items, but I am not buying - lol.",

My insurance company will pay for one night sleeve each year, well after deductible and co pays.. I just had my tribute altered. I never took advantage of the free alteration in the past and my sleeve was loose and was not working as well as it should have. It feels odd since just getting it back. Feels snugger, they also altered my outer sleeve as well. The first night I had to take it off half way through the night. The next night I was fine. I don't know what happened last night but I woke up with sausage fingers, my arm ached and I had a pocket of fluid around my elbow. My sleeve goes from hand to axilla (no fingers - just thumb) and until last night it has never been a problem. I am hoping it was just to over exertion and the heat and humidity yesterday.",

I didn't know if I want reconstruction so at first so I waited. After my pathology report I decided to have a prophylatric mastectomy on the other side after completing chemo. A year later I made the choice to do bilateral LAT flaps with an expander. My LE did not get any worse. After more then a year at trying to get my new breast mounds at least into two actual breast mounds I changed PS's and started over again. This time with a DIEP Flap. I am happy to say I am finally done with reconstruction. This time around still my LE stayed stable as well. Through out my surgeries and chemo I was back and forth for sessons of PT, not the entire time but a few different times to help with the LE, range of motion, or the tightness of the scars. I do need to wear a bra and found a couple wonderful bras that I wear. Eventually I may have the choice of wearing a bra or not. However right now I am in the process of massaging scars and such and a bra feels better during the day. It keeps my new breast contained per say so it reduces the weight of them on my healing scars. My only regret was not finding my current PS sooner. There are no guarantees with LE and surgery of any kind. So I would say there is no right or wrong answer. It's a personal choice. Good luck with your decisons.",

I still have lymphedema (yes right hand and dominant hand). Now I am as careful as I can be with the other side (prophylactic mastectomy with SNB - 3 nodes). I am also careful with my LE side as well and try to follow a routine. I am now concerend about the other side and decided to see PT because she has that sides measurements from when I first started. I don't have the swelling in the other side just a weid feeling, the feeling of fullness, and sometimes achiness. But then it goes away and all is fine. But I want to make sure. Binney I have read the position papers but I sort of am not sure who came across the information and how.

I already have LE in my right arm which happened with in days after surgery. The left arm is fine, for now. I say this because in October I had what I thought could be the start of LE. I had some blood work and BP done using this arm. Well I knew I could be taking a risk but didn't really want to believe it. Any way within a few hours my arm started to ache, I also noticed some swelling. Was I imagining it this? No After 5 years of dealing with LE I would like to think I know when I see something not typical for me. I did MLD and elevated my arm. Then I called my PT and made an appointment to have things checked out. Thankfully no signs where present. Anyway I have managed to have BP done else where (ankle/thigh) at other providers offices. I have managed to have an IV done in my foot/ankle for surgery. So today I go to the doctor (GP) because I had a few elevated blood levels in Ocotber when I had blood done during a pre-surgical physical. So I return a few months later like my doctor asked me. I purposely did not fast because I knew he would pressure me and I wanted to use the lab that will do blood draws using my foot. We had a coversation with him remarking that a simple rubber band (the tounequet) would not cause a problem. I told him I didn't think so until the last time and then explained to him. He tried to brush it off. He then asked about BP and I told him my thigh or ankle can and have been used. He said there is no proof they are true numbers. Maybe or maybe not, but if it regularly done then we would see what's normal for me. I made it very clear that I already have limitations on my right arm and did not want to pose a risk for the left arm. Of course when he writes the lab slip I had to ask him to note from foot. He did so reluctantly. It is just so frustrating to feel like I need to fight him each time I go in. I think it may be time to start checking for a new doctor, one who will be willing to work with me. Log in to post a reply",

Sleeves (Mediven Mondi Day Sleeve and Solaris Tribute Night Sleeve) came in and seemed to fit upon trying them on. But after wearing them for about three days (washing the day sleeve daily). Something just didn't seem right. The day sleeve slipped and bunched at the elbow. It also does not seem to come high enough on my arm. The night sleeve seems loose in the hand and upper arm. So the fitter remeasured and ordered me a new day sleeve, adjusting the length by one cm. As well as a different type band. I hope this works. One cm just does not seem to be much. The night sleeve is odd as it seems as there is no affect or pattern on my hand but there is a pattern on my thumb. There is a pattern on my lower arm and it is gradual and fades as it goes up my arm. Now I wash the night sleeve weekly but after about the third day the pattern is less noticeable on the lower arm and almost non existent on the upper arm. The fitter tells me there should be no pattern on my hand or thumb. She told me not to have the sleeve snug against the web of my thumb and had me put on my sleeve to show me how it should be worn. I did this last night and it didn't make any difference. It's been a long time since I had a good fitting set of sleeves so I am doubting myself and the fit of the sleeves. I know Solaris will make the night sleeve right but I just do not want to go through another year of this. Can others comment and share the fitting of their sleeves please. TIA.

My last sleeve was too short and too tight so we had it remade and my fitter was not sure how the band would be (sew into the top and be part of the sleeve or onto and be in addition to the sleeve because we were chaging from an oblique fit to a standard fit). Turns out it was sewn onto so that silicone band plus the one centimeter addition resulted in the sleeve being too big and bunching. The sleeve seems almost perfect below the elbow where 80% of my swelling is. See I can't be a simple measurement and can't wear my sleeve all the way to axilla because of a some what thicker axilla area (well compared to most) due to my first attempt at reconstruction being not so good and my lat muscle and scaring still in that region. Good news is I had the reconstruction undone and redone, this time DIEP. It's much better but like I said the lat muscle and the additional scar tissue is still in the general region so a sleeve needs to be a happy medium, not too low but not all the way up to the axilla region. My (new) fitter is very receptive into making things right and I have faith as I have learned that my fitter has other (happy) patients on the MB. I love the learning and looking out for one another on this MB.",

See I don't need a sleeve or gauntlet. With a well fitting sleeve I have no problem with my hand or fingers. My PT also told me my forearm is longer then most people so she has to add a measurement when she does her measuring.

Now I just got my 4th sleeve since December 2012. First one was too short and the silicone was only partial. Second one was way too long and I posted pictures of it on this thread. The next one came in and was too short again. So I decided to check with a different location/fitter with the current company. They had the local sleeve rep from Medi and a second one come in from out of state to check the sleeve and measure my arm. Well it was too short, so they measured my arm several times in a couple different ways. I was given a business card by the local rep and told to call any time there is a concern. So I picked up my new sleeve today and we will see how things go as it fit like a glove at first but I am a little concerned about the length and the elbow region. I wore the sleeve for several hours and took it off and it is irritated and red in the elbow region. The redness is going away gradually and it is most likely because I have been wearing older stretched out sleeves and this is a new sleeve. So hoping for the best and will ease into wearing the new sleeve a little longer each day.",

I stopped at her office today to get the visit notes from a visit last week which did indicate I had \"lymphedema\" and wore a sleeve. Not sure if this would be enough because there is no code in the office visit. I am also not sure why the fitter needs to know all of my medical history and my recent office visit. Seems like an invasion of privacy to me. I could have been discussing private matters that have to do with the after affects of breast cancer and nothing to do with lymphedema.  I do have a call into the PA at the breast surgeon but her office is not good with this sort of thing so that's why I go to my oncologist. I have an appointment with my primary care doctor Monday for something else so I am not sure he would even want to get involved. My next step would be the PT but they don't believe in sleeves, they expect patients to wrap iindefinately and w/o foam or padding. Which I truely believe did more harm then good for me. The second PT is out patient at the hospital. I guess I could call them but by the time I get an appointment my measurements would be off. I wish it was just about a form looking for a signature but that is not good enough. I have made two trips to the fitter now, the new fitter is an hour one way. I just don't where else to turn.",

I needed to have a blood draw and the iv stopped allowing blood flow. I told the nurses and the doctor right there no they could not stick me any other place but my foot. The doctor told the nurse so do it. She said it's been a long time and she would need him to write the orders. He stopped and did the blood draw right there. Yes the doctor did the blood draw in the hospital right in my room. He went a little further then my foot above my ankle but in the front. Ouch! He said if moore blood is needed then have them draw a little lower so it won't be so painful. But doctors can and should take over in a situation like this. Breast cancer and the complcations that are involved with it are part of the disibility act and we are protected so I wonder if refusing to accomadate us for this would be discrimination? Something to think about.  Be careful with MRI's or CT's with contrast. A larger needle is often needed for the contrast so be prepared for a little more discomfort then the norm when inserting it int he foot/hand.",

Right now I have decided to wrap a few night a week to see if I can work on some swelling around my elbow. Might be adding foam or a swell spot too. The book mentioned has a lot if information in it. I got this several years back. I think they may have updated portions of it. Does anyone know if it addresses the issue of those of us at risk or with LE on both sides? Okay now please don't gasp at this. But I have found when shaving my legs in the shower if I turn the shower head to the relaxing massage I am moving around enough to actually get the back portion of my MLD. It probally should not be used in place of MLD on a regular basis but hey every few days it works well with not too much pressure.  Dating the banadages so we know when to replace them is a great ideal. I started doing this a few years back. By the way if you are using a night sleeve it never hurts to have a set of current bandages on hand.  I try (but have been a little too lax) to wrap when I need to wash the night sleeve. This way the night sleeve can dry overnight and I can keep current with my wrapping skills. This also tends to soften my arm even more so. By the way when I stop at traffic lights or wait my turn at the bank or yes fast food place I also tend to clear the neck and under arm areas and sometimes even the groin area - hey no one can see me and I don't care if they could - lol. If it works for me then that's what counts. Some days I do this several times a day for an extra benefit. Oh and with the warmer weather here I drink a lot more decaf iced tea. When drinking coke it's also decaf when possible as well. I have heard/read that caffeine in large amounts is not good for LE. I wish we didn't have so much humidity. But it's par for the course here in Maryland. So I try to keep one of the red plastic slippie things in my car with me. See sometimes I need to remove my sleeve when out and about and need to do a mini MLD on my arm also. But the humidity makes it hard to put my sleeve back on and the slippie makes this easier. Don't forget to touch base with your therapist every now and then as well. Especially if insurance covers it you can never go wrong with a couple sessions of formal MLD. Not to mention they are a source of information. Jennifer",

We are going to check the sleeve, check my arm and remeasure my arm. Although I am not sure how the arm will be as I am working hard trying to resolve the issues caused by the altered sleeve. I am no longer using the altered sleeve. I am wearing my previous sleeve which is about 2 years old and was loose but last night felt so good on my arm. Unfortunately I am having a hard time wearing my day sleeves now. I did notice they sewed a seam binding strip on the outside of the sleeve and the Solaris Trade mark is missing on the upper arm of the sleeve. So it looks like it was adjusted too much. I was working with a lady at Solaris and think I will let her know what happened as well.",

If I would have known this was needed (been wearing sleeves for 8.5 years now) I would have asked for this when seeing her. She is a wonderful surgeon but her office is clueless on things like this. Why it has to be this complicated is beyond me.",

Come to find out only the measurements were done and after a week of thinking the sleeves were being made they were not. Seems the new fitter wants the doctor to change his notes indicating lymphedema, and not edema. However the doctor is using the diagnosis code for lymphedema and will not change the notes. Nither will budge so the fitter will not order the sleeves. I am so upset over this because the previous fitter messed up the lastest remake of my night sleeve and is telling me they can no longer make my sleeves. Apparently they don't have the ability to please me. Guess wanting sleeves that fit makes me a problem patient. So I went back to the new fitter for my night sleeve measurements today and need to get this sleeve form the new fitter as well. So my appointment with the doctor is in January and my arm will not make it any longer with out new sleeves. I just don't know why this s so complicated. It is so upsetting and I don't know what to do. Any suggestions? Log in to post a reply",

The claim has not even been sent because they wanted the additional information from the doctor and what he sent does not seem to be enough for them. I talked to the insurance company twice now and both times they said they do not need the additional information. The RX from the doctor with the diagnosis code is enough. The fitter says this is their company policy. The previous two fitters developed this policy a few years ago as well however they excepted what the doctor sent and there was no hold up. The fitter did now say they would have the day sleeve made because the doctors notes would now work for those. But they will not make the night sleeve with those notes unless I leave my credit card with them. They are worried about the doctors notes and the fact I already had a night sleeve made and returned/claim being voided. Telling me my insurance company will not pay for my night sleeve until December because it will be a year from that time and I am only allowed to have one night sleeve a year and all this mess started last December. Once again the insurance company said no this is wrong. Even if the night sleeve was not returned the insurance company does not limit the number of sleeves (day or night) that I can get each year. Of course in the beginning of the year we have deductible to meet and the first set of sleeves can do this with no problem. But after that it is just a copay. I did get a call from the PA at the breast surgeon. She left a message telling me she thinks she can help. So I am hoping to talk to her today. The insurance company has offered to do a conference call with the fitter to get this all cleared up. It may come to this. Although not sure if the fitter will because they are telling me that my insurance company is just telling me what I want to hear. However my insurance company has never not covered any sleeve. Never denied any claim associated with my diagnosis or any thing associated with it. So this is where I hang in limbo. I do know any paper work needed I will have faxed to me and then I will fax it to the fitter. Something tells me this is the best route for the future.",

So my fitter measured my arm and we discovered there were changes in my arm that did warrant the sleeve to be altered. I got it back three days ago and well night one I made it half was through the night and had to take it off. The next night I was fine and made it most of the night. Last night I made it all night but woke up with sausage fingers, a sore arm and some fluids pockets around my elbow. I managed to get the the fluids to move through massage. Then put my day sleep on. Made the mistake of napping on the couch today with my day sleeve on and woke up again to sausage fingers - pretty pain full. Any way I am not sure if it is the sleeve alterations or perhaps over use and hot weather with high humidity as we set up and celebrated our daughter's engagement this weekend. I did not lift any thing too heavy. But the days and nights were long. Rest was not the best. Then the weather. The sleeve is snug and the outer jacket (which was also altered) makes it a little more snug. I can still move my arm fine. But can't do as much as I am used to doing, like holding my phone or pad to read before bed. I have to admit this sleeve feels more snug then any Tribute night sleeve that I have ever had. Any one else had a sleeve altered? I don't know if I should be worried, give it a little more time or call the fitter back and see what she says. Log in to post a reply",
