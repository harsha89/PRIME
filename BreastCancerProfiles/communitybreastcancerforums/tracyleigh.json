      "Content": "Jan 14, 2013 08:13AM - edited Jan 14, 2013 08:15AM by tracyleigh Hey, all.  My participation here has been so sparse that I almost didn't write, but I have some thoughts on a few things mentioned and figured that, if it might be helpful to anyone, then I should contribute. I was dealing with prolonged nausea too and talked to my MO's awesome nurse about it last week.  She said that nausea shouldn't be an issue past a few days out from tx, so beyond that, it's likely heartburn/indigestion.  She suggested that I start doing Pepcid 2xday instead of the 1xday that I was doing, and it totally did the trick.  (The chemo drugs kinda scrape the inside of your stomach raw - it's lined with the fast-growing cells that chemo targets - so it gets aggravated easily until it can bounce back.)  Also, for tx day and the couple of days after, I found that it's imperative to never really get hungry, but to keep something on my stomach all the time. duckiedee, I also dealt with constipation a lot after my first tx.  I finally started taking dulcosate sodium as my nurse suggested around day 4, but because I hadn't been on top of it, it took several days of taking the medicine, eating a lot of fiber and drinking a lot of water to get back to normal.  It was miserable.  The second time around, I did dulcosate sodium, 2 pills twice a day, starting the morning of tx, and everything was perfect. Finally, Nicole503, my hair \"down there\" was the first to go. The hair on my head soon followed.  I was looking forward to losing the hair on my legs, but had to shave it to make it finally go away.  And I don't think it's TMI - we're all dealing with it, so we may as well talk about it! Final AC tx on Wednesday!!  Now that everything tastes the way it should, my challenge is to NOT spend these last couple of feel-good days eating constantly and badly...",

MTJulie, I hope treatment goes smoothly for you today.  I can't help but chuckle just a little at your clever choices of Dexter and Nurse Jackie while you're there.",

SherylB, thank you for the Prilosec tip!  I'll absolutely ask about it.  The heartburn lasts a little longer each round; I'll have tx on Wednesday and am still dealing with it from the last round. Beckster, my nurse said that a mouth rinse of about a teaspoon of baking soda in 4-6 oz. of water would help with the taste and white tongue issue.  I sure hope so; I really dread that this next week. kslansky, you're two days ahead of me on exactly the same schedule (I'll do 12 weeks of Taxol).  Can't wait to get #4 behind me on Wednesday.  Hope the joy of being done with AC will make any tough moments over the next few days a lot easier!",

Nicole, it has been a lot; the last six weeks have included diagnosis (11/16), Thanksgiving, testst,tests,tests, Christmas, and 3 rounds of chemo.  Besides that, I'm only 39, and there is very little cancer in my family and no breast or uterine cancer.  Completely blindsided.  YOU'VE had a whirlwind of a couple of months, too!  Looks like you've just started chemo - I hope you're off to a smooth start.  I LOVE hearing about your post-workday dismantling - I wonder if we'll miss being able to pull off the hair hat when all of this is behind us... Jenjenl, I hope the Claritin works for you.  That ache is horrible; Zyrtec starting the day of the shot has done OK for me (Benadryl gave me a horrible drug hangover/haze) with Tylenol/Motrin addressing any leftover ache pretty well.  Neulasta will be a thing of the past with Taxol for me.  You too?",

Bren58, I was advised to chew ice chips while the Adriamycin is being administered to eliminate or reduce mouth sores, and it's worked like a charm (it reduces the intake of the drug there, thus reducing or eliminating its effect).  I see that that drug is not part of your cocktail, but might it work for you? PeggySull, you're just ahead of me on the same scheduel - last AC tomorrow  and Taxol starting 1/30.  So glad you asked for question recommendations.  Soteria205, what would be the expected damage to nails on Taxol? Judaday, I'm so sorry you've had such a tough time this round.  It's especially frustrating to spend precious feel-good days on being sick.",

Paula, those no-taste days are rotten for sure.  When I have them, I worry I'm eating too much in my quest for flavor (plus I sometimes have a hard time distinguishing nausea from hunger), and when they're done, I worry I'm eating too much because I'm so glad to enjoy food again.   I hope #3 goes well for you!",
