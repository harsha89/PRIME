It says it's for women over 40 who may have decreased levels of estrogen. (thanks to tamoxifen that's me) It has caffeine in it.  If I can find it in the stores I will give it a try.",

I had activity in between my 8th and 9th rib during my bone scan.  It turned out to be nothing.  I had surgery when I was 18 months old to remove a tumour in the same location.  The dr said it was probably from that.  Having said that your sled accident is definetly a possibility. My thoughts are with you (and all the other women who share their feelings...thank you)",
