I had done the MRI and biopsy but the results are not yet in. The waiting is just too tiring. I have strong faith in God and I believe that anything bad or good that happens is from God. We all know that He knows what is in our hearts and He will help us through as we take the long journey as we battle this breast cancer.",

I was dx with DCIS after u/s and mammogram.I went to the breast surgeon. She requires MRI to make sure. I did the MRI and biopsy yesterday results must e next week. I am scheduled for CT scan. I think this is pretty scary not knowing what to expect. I also have hyperthyroidism seen by endocrinologist gave me medicines. i also have swelling on my right neck follicular adenoma. I am 53 yrs. old have 2 grown up kids with their own families and a 13yr old boy. I was devastated at first but i have some good support and prayers from loved ones, friends and friends i just had met on this site.Knowing i am not alone, gives me comfort and strength that there is God who listens to our prayers.i'll be posting the results on my post soon as i got them. And i want to hear from this great guys who have the same dx as mine who had battled it through. My prayers to all of us who have been afflicted with this breast cancer.",
