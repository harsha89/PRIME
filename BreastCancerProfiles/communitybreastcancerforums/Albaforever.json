Its hard, painless, a weird shape and fixed in place. I say weird because its not round. I ignored it to begin with but after a week it was still there, so i went to the docs expecting to be told either, i was imagining things or it was nothing to worry about.. Well how wrong was i !! There is a lump and it is worth worrying about.. The doc said she cant tell what it is tho it could be a fibroadenoma, tho they are usually painfull, round and moveable. I should say i had a partial Hysterectomy 2 years ago so have no periods.. Iv been referred to a one stop clinic where all tests are done in one appt and the results are given out on the day, this appt is on the 23rd of May and am becoming more and more worried about it. Everything iv read tells me it isnt a fibroadenoma BUT i would really like to speak to someone who has had one and can explain what there like.. Please help me... Log in to post a reply",
