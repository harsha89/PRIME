      "Content": "Feb 2, 2010 03:26AM fighting4mykids wrote: Hi here.  congrats on finishing one stage of your chemo.   I found Taxol to be much easier to allow me to function. The a/c gave me a run for my money and really I lost days after each treatment. With Taxol I did have major body pain, but at least I was up and around and with it.  I either took pain killers (low dose) or tylenol. Like other posters, I did not get the pains until day 2 after treatment. I was also doing neulsta shots (to boost my white blood cell counts quicker) which gives you extra body pains as well.  The Taxol pains lasted anywhere from 3-5 days once they kicked in and with each treatment they got longer and a bit more intense but I would much rather take Taxol over A/C.  Hands down.  The first 2 infusions they gave me benadryl to hopefully offset any allergic reaction. The 1st benadryl does was a megadose which knocked me for a loop and then the 2nd they reduced the amount because I tolerated the 1st taxol good and then by the 3rd, no more bendryl.  My hair started sprouting while I was on Taxol as well. I thought it was my imagination at first but literally the week after I finished taxol I had a fuzz over my head (but then my eyebrows fell out as well as my eyelashes).",

I had just delivered a set of twins when I started chemo.  Once I finihsed chemo and started flushing all the toxic drugs out of my system, I started losing someof the chemo weight. I thought chemo always made people lose weight but i was surprised by the opposite affect for me. Do you get weighed each time you go to chemo?  I would ask your onco. about this. most likely you should start drinking those protein shakes to ensure you are getting what you need. ",

I am 36 and no family history so if this hit me once, it could hit me again so I opted for the bilateral. I had the surgery on 8/28 and feeling pretty good.  The pain is barely noticeable and I just got my drains out today and got the approval to lift my arms above my head.  Good luck. It's your body and your decision. You will get many opinions from many people wherever you go but ultimately you are the only one that can make this decision.",
