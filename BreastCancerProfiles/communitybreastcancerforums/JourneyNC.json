I had, what they called, an Anxiety Reaction on my 2nd chemo on 7/7/09. It started in the middle of my chest what I thought was nauseau. This turned extreme when I could not BREATHE!  My nose was closing and my chest tight. Luckily, being in an open infusion room, the nurses attended to me immedately as well as my Hema Onc who would only schedule an appointment with his patients on the days he is present. They gave me Atavan and Benedryl. This calmed me down. They continued with Cytoxan and then treated me again with the Taxotere without any problems. My onc. indicated many go through this after their second treatment. What I did differently was not want the Atavan. Now, this will be the regimen..Nausau drip, Steroid, Atavan and Benedryl, Cytoxan then Taxotere last. Since we all have to be our own advocates to our treatments, I Wish you the Best Treatments for here forward.",
