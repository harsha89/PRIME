I was diagnosed in Feb. 2014 with Stage 4 MBC after being in \"remission\" for almost 5 years. I have been fighting ever since. I have 2 Clinical Trials, 2 Gamma Knifes and 1 Hormone Therapy treatment under my belt. This week I get my third Gamma Knife and start another Chemo. So happy I found this site! :)  ",
