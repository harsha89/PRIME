Anyways I went to a friend who is a retired surgeon and asked him - he examined me and found a lump on my L breast and also noticed a slight indentation when I raise my arms, lean forward or put my hands on my hips and flex my chest muscles.  This indentation is only visible on the L breast. He said that I should go for an MRI which I did and the results are confusing for me.  They have given me a birads2 score - then they talk about an area in my L breast which didnt enhance with the dye they gave me at the MRI so they think that is it a fibroadenoma.  They said there were also several tiny masses on my R breas and that glandular tissue was quite prominent. Now, should I have biopsy's done just to confirm these results or are these MRI readings always right?  Also, with this funny indent could that be caused by a fibroadenoma?  I dont know whether to stop worrying - I dont know who else to turn to.  I would ask my surgeon friend but he has just left for an extended vacation and wont be back for 4 months. Any suggestions? Many thanks Log in to post a reply",
