They found a tiny 4mm spot on her left breast, did an ultrasound and decided to have it biopsied. The doctors seemed sure it was just scar tissue. She's not too worried but I am. She's never had any surgery on her breasts before. Is it likely to just have a spot of random scar tissue in your breast? Everything I'm reading says it usually happens after surgery. She's breastfed 3 children, her last stopping a year ago. Any info anyone may have regarding a similar situation would be very appreciated. She doesn't get results til next week and I'm on edge Thank you in advance. Log in to post a reply",

Unfortunately I can't get any of the report(s) because she claims she doesn't have them, she doesn't know the BIRADS or anything. This is her first mammo, she's 37 so don't think she's familiar with the processes. She's being extremely nonchalant about the whole thing because she said the doctor seemed adamant that it was scar tissue but wanted to be safe. She didn't mention radial scar just simply scar tissue. They did a needle biopsy, not sur whther core or fine. She didn't know. Thank again for your advice.",
