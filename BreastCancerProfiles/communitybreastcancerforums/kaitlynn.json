I feel a lot better about all of this then I did yesterday. I was able to eat today, and get some sleep. I have a therapist appointment on the 12th so I can talk about all of this. It doesn't help matters much that I am schizoaffective. That's like having schizophrenia, and bipolar all at once. SUCKS. I take a butt load of meds as it is. I don't want to take anymore. I'm just hoping it's some other hormone problem. Thanks for listening guys Log in to post a reply",

She came back, and said they found something. She showed me the spot on the exray. It's a small spot. She said .. Ok, now you are going to ultra sound. Went to ultra sound. She looked, and looked, and looked, and couldn't find anything. SHe said well it's plain as day on the Mamo. Before I went to utra sound I just said, \"Whatever it is God I'm still going to love you\". The ultrasound specialist said she was sorry she couldn't have been of more help. I told her that was ok. I asked what do I do now? She just said that my doctor would be in contact with me in a few days. I'm not freaked out, or scared like I was. I feel really good. I know that God is going to take care of me no matter what. So I guess I get to hurry up and wait. *grins* So, I'll be in touch. Log in to post a reply",

I had been wanting to watch it all week but everytime I went to go get it .. It was taken. Well today was my day! LOL Awsome movie. If you haven't seen it. It's a must see. It shows first hand how faith, and obediance in God works .. It was so touching. I almost cried thru the whole thing. But I kept sucking it up. ehehhe This man in this movie just basically gave it all to God and said no matter what that he would still praise him. It was just simply amazing. And that's all I'm gonna say about it other than if you need to tease up your faith this is a must see.",
