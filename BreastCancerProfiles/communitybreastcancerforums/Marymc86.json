I had a scab form over my nipple after radiation. I picked it off and it came back. I was also concerned it might be Pagets. My RO gave me Triamcinolone cream and I used it for a month and went back. It was better. Also had mammogram with good results. She did not think it was cancer. Neither did my MO. But both of them asked me if I had discharge and I did not. If I had, I feel like they would have sent me for a biopsy at Dermatologist. I was told Pagets moves fast, so, if you see changes, call your doctor and insist they see you again. Good luck. I know the fear you are feeling, but the Dermatologist is the next step.  ",

It took a week to get my biopsy results and then my Primary Care Physician delivered the news over the phone, which I was fine with that. I had invasive plus DCIS I had a lump in my right breast from age 22. At 24, I had my first mammogram and ultrasound, no biopsy then. They said it was a fibroadenoma and benign. Now I wonder if it was cancer that stayed dormant for 30 years? Anyway, I had a lumpectomy last March. My surgeon recommended lumpectomy and said that lumpectomy plus radiation is as effective as mastectomy. That is some food for thought. Whatever you decide, take it one step at a time. If you don\u2019t feel comfortable with one doctor, ask for another opinion. BTW, my surgeon asked if I wanted a second opinion. I said no. I thought she was great. And, the surgery was a breeze. The biopsy was the worst part of my entire treatment. And I had breast reduction surgery between lumpectomy and radiation. It\u2019s all so overwhelming in the beginning. And I agree with others, the waiting is hard. Things move slow when you want them to go fast. Keep us posted. This is where I lived (breastcancer. .Org) in the beginning. So much information and so many supportive people going through the same thing. Keep us posted.",

I also want to say to those who have been crying on the table...I was an emotional wreck on the first day. The last day I was smiling and happy. It's been a long 7 months for me, too. 2 surgeries, but no chemo. I had signed on as a new Realtor and had just begun training when I was diagnosed. Financial stress, job stress, medical stress. I finally just backed off from work and concentrated on cancer and getting through radiation. Thankfully, my supervisor and coworkers understood. Take care of yourselves. It will get better soon. As I say that, I'm headed to slather on my aloe and vitamin E cream. Keep doing it after rads, too.",

I've been using it for about 3 days and noticed the growth, scab or whatever is already coming back. Gotta tell ya, I'm a little unnerved by it. She wants to see me back in a month after diagnostic mammogram. Radiation is easy? That cording is weird. I had it, too. Keep stretching. I feel really tight in the armpit and shoulder area if I don't keep the tissue moving.",

You were the first one I saw on these boards that had a higher oncotype and refused chemo. Your posts have played a part in influencing my decisions. I appreciate your input. I've also read where you have said if you could go back you might not do the AI either. In the post on this thread, you said you wish you had known \"the real side effects of AIs \". Can you tell us what you mean by the real side effects? The reason I don't want to take AI s is joint pain and bone loss. I don't want to take Tamoxifen because of increased risk of stroke. I had terrible joint pain in my 30s for some unknown reason. I'm not suffering with that now, but I certainly don't want to take a drug to cause me to feel like that again. And, I don't wish to become disabled from bone loss and pain from arthritis. I made that point clear to my MO. Then, she explored the idea of tamoxifen. She tested me to see if I was post menopausal. 2 tests. Estradiol was finished. FSH still in play. So, tamoxifen was a possibility since I had not finished menopause. My family has a high incidence of strokes. I told her no to the tamoxifen if it could possibly cause a stroke. I don't wish to have a stroke. Once that happens, I'm pretty much in a nursing home. No thank you. So, my fear of being permanently disabled and unable to care for myself FAR outweighs my fear of dying from cancer. So, my MO and other doctors heard me and I did the surgery and radiation and that's all. If it comes back, I might decide otherwise, not sure.",

I'm also considering skipping out on Tamoxifen, too. I'm doing radiation now and, so far, it's going well. Halfway through it. I'll have to tackle the drug therapy issue next. I suppose I'll cave and try it, but I really don't want to. I hope I don't regret skipping chemo later. I've had moments when I thought I was crazy, but I think I can live with my decision even if it does recur. So many stories of people who did opt for chemo and still had a recurrence. I think I would have done it if I had been HER2+ . ",

I also am not taking Tamoxifen, which was also highly recommended. My MO resigned right at the critical decision point for me. Just my luck. Since then, August, I've seen the \"substitute \" MO and this week, I see ANOTHER substitute MO. They said the decision to do chemo in the intermediate oncotype range, 19-30, is based on age. I was told 50 and under chemo is recommended. My MO put me in the younger range even though I was past 50 because I was not completely through menopause, which was news to me, and because I'm otherwise active and healthy. I'd usually be thrilled to be put in the young group, but I didn't want chemo. It scares me. What if it makes other body systems worse? I've worked hard at being healthy, I don't want to kill the good to maybe prevent more bad. And the maybe is the key word there. I'm at peace with choosing no chemo. Sometimes I feel like I should be taking tamoxifen, but again, it's all a maybe. You have to choose what you think is right, be at peace with it and live your life. I am having a diagnostic mammogram this week. Scared to get the results. I don't think we will ever feel like it's just routine anymore.",
