The burned skin around my nipple and areola 'shed' a couple weeks ago.  I have a nice new layer of pink skin on my nipple, but what remains is a thin ring of the darker/burned skin around the very outside ring of  my areola.  That one area doesn't seem to want to peel.   In the scheme of things, this is probably no big deal...but how long before this also peels?  It's a bit freaky looking~ Am I stuck with this?
