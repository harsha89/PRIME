I had two lumpectomies and they didn't get clear margins either time so I ended up needing a mastectomy anyway. (I ended up getting bilateral, for symmetry, with immediate direct-to-implant reconstruction.) If you are going for lumpectomies, do those first. See if they get clear margins and if any other treatment is deemed necessary (e.g. if you need radiation, which can affect the remaining tissue and skin). Worry about reconstruction later, once you're cancer free. The first step is to get rid of the cancer. On the other hand, you could get a mastectomy and immediate reconstruction at the same time.",

My genetic testing was clear but my maternal grandmother had breast cancer in her old age. Ultimately I opted for a double mastectomy and sentinel node biopsy (with immediate, direct-to-implant reconstruction) -- mainly for reasons of symmetry and my lack of confidence in the imaging of my dense breasts -- and am so glad I did. The key takeaways from the pathology report were (1) sentinel node was clear; (2) DCIS was present on 9 out of 45 slides (one-fifth) of the tissue samples from my left breast (which had never shown up on the pre-surgical MRI, nor multiple mammograms and ultrasounds), and (3) while DCIS was not found in my right breast, lobular carcinoma in situ and atypical ductal hyperplasia -- areas of abnormal cell growth that increase a person's likelihood of developing invasive breast cancer later in life -- were present in my right breast as well as my left. Multiple intraductal papillomas were present in both breasts as well, which are also markers for increased risk of breast cancer. So I feel very good about my decision to have a bilateral mastectomy. While it wasn't an easy decision, it was the right one for me. Knowing that I am cancer-free is priceless and DH is super-relieved as well. I had dense breasts and regular mammogram and ultrasound imaging was never a very successful diagnostic tool for me. Now my BS says I just need an MRI every 3-5 years. They weighed the tissue they removed -- 530 ccs on each side -- and put in implants that were almost exactly the same size -- 550 CCs. It is nice to be about as symmetrical as I was before and about the same size (just a little perkier) -- because my clothes fit about the same. I did immediate direct-to-implant reconstruction (no tissue expanders!) with smooth round silicone implants placed above the pectoral muscle, using AlloDerm. I was up and walking around the next day and was able to raise my arms above my head immediately after waking up from the anesthesia. The recovery was not bad at all, honestly (the drains were the worst part). I was fortunate not to need pain meds once I was discharged from the hospital -- just Tylenol. Good luck with whatever you decide!",

If the clots migrate to the lungs it can be dangerous. I know because I experienced shortness of breath (which I misinterpreted as asthma symptoms) and went to the doctor. After testing my blood oxygen level she immediately sent me for a CT scan which showed massive blood clots (pulmonary emboli) in both lungs. They transferred me to the emergency room and while waiting to be admitted to a hospital bed I coded and had to be resuscitated twice. They ended up bringing in a specialist -- an interventional radiologist -- who pulled out the clots from my lungs using a corkscrew-like device which was inserted through my pelvis. I was unconscious for five days and released from the hospital after a week. In my case it turned out that I had a genetic mutation that I was unaware of which predisposed me to blood clots, in addition to having recently flown on a lengthy international trip and having been on birth control pills for many years. Bottom line: Insist on testing until they get to the bottom of it -- I was lucky because my doctor took it seriously!",
