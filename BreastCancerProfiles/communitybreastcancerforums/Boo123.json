      "Content": "Boo123 wrote: Hello everyone,  Here in the UK a popular celebrity has this week been outed through the media with headlines that she is  \"battling lung cancer.\"  Personally, I find that when folk talk about my \"battle\" / \"fight\" with cancer when talking to me, that I do not like this approach. My view, from initial diagnosis and then recent progression to stage IV, is that I am a patient being treated for a serious, chronic and life-threatening illness. But I do not feel that I am fighting anything / in a battle with my own body / being brave / being inspirational. I am doing none of these things. I am having the best treatment available for a physical illness that I did not chose to develop within my body. From my initial 2011 diagnosis, I have always seen myself as a patient being treated by a fantastic medical team who are doing their best to help me and give me quality of life at the same time. I put my trust in these experts, my treatment, ongoing research and science. I believe that science will do for me what science can do. I retain a positive attitude, am optimistic and upbeat. I just don't like these fighting / battling descriptors, that is all. I feel that these words may in fact help to perpetuate the scary / aggressive perception of cancer, and work to continue the fear that surrounds the use of the C word itself. I am just wondering how folk feel when being told they are battling with / fighting MBC? Without in any way wishing to undermine the position of, or upset other people who do feel comfortable with the warrior / battle / fight language that seems to surround this disease, (and I do understand that for many people this approach will be both positive and helpful) I was wondering if there are any other people out there who also shy away from the fighting language and prefer to be thought of as a patient? I am posting this question because I am genuinely interested - maybe it is just me that curls up at these fighting words and the overall language culture of coming out fighting is the accepted way to go. I hope to receive some constructive comments and thoughts - I've thought carefully about whether to even post this topic as I don't want to cause upset or distress to anyone, and am respectful that everyone's way of handling this illness is their own right way. Thanks for sharing your thoughts. Boo Log in to post a reply",

To be quit honest I don't have the energy for even a minor argument, let alone a fight with anything. I am exhausted from chemo and still have  more to come, then surgery, then lots more chemo planned. I know my lovely onc is at my back and the plan is aggressive with NED the end goal. But like you I see myself as going through treatment. I am not in a battle with myself. How could I battle anything? What are my weapons? The choice of chemo rests with the experts here in the UK, and they work to very clear guidelines. Rolling with the punches is a good expression and if its OK with you I am going to take it and use it when being questioned by folk about my treatment.  Thank you to all of you for sharing your thinking and for such wonderful support.  Hey ho from the West of England, where today it was bright and sunny.

Do they aspire to this status? I sincerely hope not.  I know that folk not in our position must at times find it difficult to find the right words to say, I remain unoffended and I am appreciative of this and would never ever dream of saying how awkward the whole battle language is to me to a third party, as I would not want to offend anyone as I do get such a lot of kind and well-meaning support. But I sooooo hate it inside when I am told that I am brave. if only they knew the truth! I am not at all brave. I may put on a confident front but inside I am jelly. I am a cautious person by nature, and not a natural risk-taker. So brave is not a word I would ever use about myself. I am doing this treatment because I have no choice, and because treatment is available and so far chemo seems to be working. That's not brave. That's sensible! So I was just dipping my toe in here on this board to see if anyone else privately finds the fighting vocabulary uncomfortable. I agree with you, that for whatever reason, my body became sick and now treatment is being deployed to hopefully get me to NED. I do wonder if because the public perception of the whole cancer world is still so misunderstood and scary, that the fighting words help to permeate that big scary C-word myth. I also understand about the invasion concept - I had malaria once and then indeed my treatment was an out an out assault upon the invading parasite. I still did not think of it as a war though - I guess my default position must be to see myself as a patient.   Hey ho. Boo.",

I tired to express my feelings on this issue to a close friend recently and could tell that she did not understand me at all, and was even slightly affronted, seeing my rejection of fighting talk as both negative and hurtful to her as she was only trying to be positive and supportive, etc. So I have learned not to share feelings on some issues to do with MBC with friends / family for fear of unintentionally upsetting people, the result of such self-censorship can be isolating. Sad. I have lurked around these boards for a long while, but rarely posted before now. I am so glad that I did. What a supportive community. Thank you all so much. It means a lot. Boo",

Each time it has been closely looked at and I got told it is not a met,  sometimes the brain just generates these bright areas for no reason and they can go away. Mine was about the size of the head of a drawing pin, shining away in the middle of my brain like a little light bulb, I saw the scan. I had no symptoms associated with mets to that area and indeed a scan two years later showed it to be gone. The neurologist called it a UBO - Unidentifiable Bright Object. He says it happens to folk more than we know. They come, they shine on scans, they go. Kind of weird. So just keep an open mind about the bright spot shown on the CT scan and stay in a positive space - hard to do, I know, but it may not be bad news. Keeping my fingers crossed that you mother has a UBO! ",

I have been a vegetarian for most of my life, but after diagnosis i was worried I might have undermined my own immune system through a highly stressful lifestyle and not eating enough protein. So I added fish back in - well, basically sustainably caught organic salmon because that is pretty much all I can cope with. but I have upped the volume of seeds and pulses, big pan of chick peas on the stove as I write. I cook up a huge bag and freeze them in a bag in the freezer laid flat, then, like frozen peas, I can just grab a handful to throw into anything. I have made every form of hummus known to woman! I love my as much as possible organic, whole foods diet - and am drawn to eating healthily and avoiding white processed flours, sugars and processed foods instinctively. Eating like this didn't stop me becoming a stage IV patient, but it does give me a lot of pleasure as it suits me. It also chimes with all of the advice from the Penny Bhron Cancer Centre here in the UK, where a healthy eating approach using whole foods and avoiding processed foods is advocated. i try and eat at least a few things known to boost the immune system every day - kale, any cruciferous vegetable, brightly coloured fruits, turmeric etc. The approach is pretty much the same as the anti-cancer diet book Mrs M writes about, which is a fantastic resource. . The thinking is that a strong immune system is more able to pounce on any rogue cell that might be showing signs of kicking off, and eliminate the cancer cells naturally. I went on a course that showed a short film clip of white blood cells (the immune system) surrounding and gobbling up some cervical cancer cells. it was fascinating. The image has stuck in my head and I will eat anything that will help my own white blood cells behave like the ones in the film clip! W So I just had a search on youtube and found the clip...have a watch...it is so motivating...White cells work together like a pack of dolphins, surrounding the cancer cells (yellow arrow) then moving in on it and just wiping it out.then shuffling off to the next bad cell and jumping on it..I want this kind of pro-active white cell behaviour going on in my own body, and this is something that we can help happen through a good diet, exercise and positivity, reducing stress. I am having trouble posting the you tube link, it does not seem to be showing on my screen. If you cant see it, then search on you tube for  Hope you all find this interesting. Boo  ",

Finally I'm taking letrozole at the same time as the xeloda chemo so a double whammy attack. I'm pretty tired and my hands and feet are a bit pink, but the main SE for me from xeloda is mild nausea and loss of appetite, griping gut pains and needing to be near a bathroom for those just gotta get there quickly moments\u2026oh joy. Still, I am not complaining as my mantra for chemo is always \"it is only temporary\" and anyway, I want to underline the plan to get me a one stretch in remission.   I'm really trying to eat healthily and exercise, not so easy on billious days but I do what I can when I can. So that's where I am at and that's my plan. Anyone else taking letrozole or another AI while doing a chemo?  Best wishes, Boo",

I then had a liver resection for two liver mets at the end of August 2014. Been on letrozole ever since and so far so good, clear scans show that I remain NED. The liver resection was a major surgery but i was very well looked after, and was home from hospital after six days. A huge scar and a slow recovery period but no complications. I consider myself to be very lucky to have had the surgery and am thankful that my medical team were prepared to put me forward for it and the surgeon agreed to do it. In fact they did a pre-surgery laparoscopy in order to check that there was noting else too small for a ct scan to show up lurking anywhere else on my liver. I've no idea what the future holds but for now am very happy to be NED. If your onc has put you forward for surgery, and your surgeon agrees to do it, then grab the opportunity! Good luck. let us know what is arranged. Boo.",

Since then I have been on letrozole, just switched to tamoxifen as my tumour markers are not behaving - with a Pet scan last December giving me a lot of confidence that i'm still NED, 18 months later. Having just one area of mets in one organ is called oligiometastatic, which is a good position within the serious context of mets. My onc is treating me as curative because of this, so aggressive chemo then surgery. The surgery is a big one, and the first few days in hospital were tough, but nurses are wonderful people and I was well cared for and I was amazed at how I quickly recovered, became mobile and was soon walking about. I had to take it easy for a few months after. My oncologist says my liver has regrown and shows on scans as healthy just a bit of an odd shape. Psychologically having the surgery remove the nectrotic tumours really helped my mental recovery, I am really glad that I had the surgery and if needs must, I would do it again. Hope this helps. Happy to answer any questions via a PM. Boo",

Past four weeks I have been experiencing a growing problem when I try to eat - no acid reflux but a huge blocked feeling at the top of my stomach, eventually it goes away and I can eat but I feel full quickly and the whole feeling is super unpleasant. I rang my onc today, who immediately said he wanted to look into it and had ordered a CT scan for Friday. If its good news, i.e. no cancer to be seen on scan, then he is going to treat me to an endoscopy (by way of a reward ha ha ) to see what is going on. Cant't say I like the idea of an endoscopy very much, but I know I would rather have a shy little hiatus hernia than another liver met pressing on the stomach valve area. If it's not one thing, it's another. Anyone had anything similar? Stupid cancer. Boo. ",

My veins are so messed up and hard through so much chemo that they are not good - the Dr thought she had the cannula for the contrast in properly, but when they tried to run it just before the CT scan, the contrast fluid escaped into my arm. Felt like the biggest most painful bee sting ever, sudden pain moving quickly over a wide area of my upper arm. Of course the radiographer and Dr rushed into the room and stopped the machine and pulled me out immediately, but it was very scary and a bit upsetting. The contrast settled into a large bulge the size of a large egg in the skin above my inner elbow...ice was applied immediately, the staff were lovely and very kind. They did find a new vein and got the scan done eventually, but I was left with a bulge that is only slowly absorbing into me. I'm OK now, but the lesson I have learned form this is to speak up a bit more when Drs try to put a cannula into the area in my inner elbow, it is just not suitable for this kind of thing any more. Anyway, I have a meeting with my lovely oncologist on Thursday morning to get the results of the scan and blood tests. Please cross fingers for me that all stays NED. Stupid cancer. Boo ",
