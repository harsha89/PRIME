Still trying to figure out how to keep it in place so I can move my arm. We did not use the bolus today. (yes it is suppose to trick the radiation into thinking it is skin so the full force of the rays are applied to the skin) I have one more rad tomorrow without the bolus and then 12 boosts for a total ofÂ  38 treatments. I was told the skin is usually about a week to 10 days behind reacting to the radiation which is why it continues to get red when we are done. I am having trouble with my medical leave. Well not the leave exactly but they want to cut off my medical benefits. I could pay the COBRA but that is twice as much as my income. Don't know how they figure you can still pay your bills! Will have to go back to work with only a week break after rad. Am not looking forward to it but what can you do.",

DX again with BC this time with 1 node involved. Triple neg both times. Did chemo again last yr. This time only 8 months between but have a reoccurrane in the inner mammary gland. did chemo a third time earlier this year (Apr) and just had my first week of rad. So far the skin is doing ok. Using Eucerin and was told to get Pro Shield (not rx but pharmacist had to order it) for at night.",

Most of them at my center are young males but they have all been professional and polite so I don't feel uncomfortable with them. I'm sure they see all sorts of things but they are always pleasant. Only one nurse so far in the chemo room has been a downer. (You know you can always pick them out!) Have had 12 tx so far out of 38. Have had a little redness but not bad yet. Spent the weekend with my sisters so feel all pumped up and ready to take on more. Stay strong and we'll all make it through this together.",

I hope you can find somewhere to stay in Rochester. I had to chuckle when I was catching up on the posts as there seems to be a lot of us on either side of 50 and having arthritis pain. If it's not one thing it's another. Good luck with your treatments.",
