Sorry I've been a no show.  I was on vacation for 2 weeks and then since coming back have been crazy busy trying to catch up after being gone and then also trying to get ready for surgery.  As for the surgery, right before I left for vacation, they postponed it until the 22cd.  At first I was upset - I just want to get it over with but now I'm glad for the extra time to get all my \"ducks\" in order. Justegan - your comment about the drains confirms my suspicion.... when I had my MX 2 years ago, the drain removal about killed me - it was awful.  I never felt anything so painful.  I nearly passed out and almost threw up. I have a really high pain tolerance too!  I REALLY dread that part of this process. I wondered why I found the drain removal so painful and my theory has been it was because I had no fat in that area and the tissue was building around the drain. Hope everyone is doing well.  I look forward to getting to know you all! Kim",

Patty, we are on the same schedule.  What time do you have your treatments?  I have mine at 10:30EST and I have to say that after only 2 times I am already tired of driving to the cancer center.  It is about an hour round trip.  I am not having any boosts - what are those?  I have heard many others talking about having them. Donna, I hate the anticipation of the side effects as well.  Even though I am only at day 3, I have tried not to even look at the area and to just not think about it.  I only recently started sleeping well since my mx (I'm a stomach and rt side sleeper) so I dread not being able to sleep on my rt side and stomach again.  I tend to burn easy when in the sun so I wonder if that is another thing against me!

I had to chuckle when I got my tatts - I always thought I'd like to get a tattoo but those little dots they gave me for rads hurt like the dickens!  Cured me of wanting a tattoo!  Good luck with your radiation!  I hope it goes well for you.",

The burning that started under may arm last week is better and I am now peeling.  I am still red, swollen and sore beneath the skin but definitely it is getting better!  I am even able to start thinking about putting a bra and prosthesis on (although I will probably still wait a few days). Trish - sorry to hear that you had to deal with more cancer but glad you were able to get it taken care of.  How is you fatigue? Somnething I want to share with you all concerning skin cancer..... I went for my yearly skin check today (I had bad burns as I kid and my parents have both had pre-melanomas and basal cell carcinomas removed so I get checked every couple of years).  My dermatologist said that the radiated areas of our chests are now at a greater risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma.  Not necessarily soon but possibly years from now.  So, make sure you regularly check that area, especially years from now.    She also now wants to see me every year instead of every couple of years.  Another skin cancer item I want to share (this wasn't confirmed with my dermatologist so yo may want to check with your own docs)....in my newspaper about a month ago there was an article by a dermatologist that indicated that women with BC have a 1.4 to 2.7 times increased risk of developing melonoma and if you have had a melanoma you have a 1.4 times increased risk of developing BC.  Apparently there has been some research indicating a genetic link between the two.  The author of the paper didn't cite her sources so I don't know if the research is sound but thought I'd pass it on since the topic has come up. Julie - my surgeon had me get a bone scan before my surgery.  While I am sure they were looking for mets, they also wanted a baseline so that they would have something to compare possible future scans to.  The only follow up test that I will be getting are of course mammos on the good breast, blood tests for tumor markers and I will get another chest xray in Novemeber.  They won't be doing other scans unless my blood work or some other symptom pops up.  Ask whether you  should have a bone scan so that you have a baseline in the event, God forbid, that you start having bone pain down the road.  As for the nausea - I had a little bit during the last 5 tx's.  It stopped when the treatment stopped. Sonia - the China Study sounds interesting.  I guess I will have to add that to my reading list.  It seems most of the anti-cancer diet info I read promotes less meat and more veggies so they all have that in common.  That is a good thing since it means they must be \"on to something\". Have a good night!  Kim",

It is another cold rainy one here and if this keeps up I am going to become depressed - I can't stand cold, dreary, rainy weather (I'm so homesick for SC and all the wonderful sunshine).   I did manage to walk yesterday in the rain but the rest of my day was shot as I was chilled to the bone and just didn't feel good. Julie - Your surgeon sounds great!  Glad she is taking your concerns seriously and is someone you can go to with your worries. Trayce - Sorry you are still having to wait for results.  How frustrating!  Sending you hugs and hoping you get your call (with good news) today. Donna - Love the dog reunion!  I bet it was fun.  I have 2 greyhounds (retired racers) and I have heard of greyhound owners getting sibs and parents together.  They claim that the dogs seem to recognize each other.  The book I was reading (finished it last night) was Breast Cancer and Me by Lois Olmstead.  Overall it wasn't very good.  Several weeks ago I heard this woman speak at a church function and she was sooooo funny!  I didn't realize she had had BC until she mentioned it briefly.  Since she was so funny I thought her book would be good.  Personally I really came to dislike her as she told about her journey through BC because she seemed so upbeat and \"everything is great\", etc.  I couldn't relate to her at all.   Finally, in one of the last chapters she opened up about her struggles and seemed more \"real\".  Sonia - I occasionally get that deep down itch (it was very bad during tx) and I have shooting pains that seem to come and go.  Last week I kept getting them in one place but they have stopped now.  I also get a sunburned feeling in several places but my skin looks fine.  Weird. Am I the only one not having a follow up with my rad onc?  I saw him Aug.23 (during tx) and had my last tx Aug. 25.  I won't see him until January/February.  I just think it is odd that no one is checking me post rads (like maybe a 1 month follow up to make sure I am healing okay or whatever).  So far I am okay and my skin looks good so I don't really need to see the rad onc but after all the damage they inflicted you'd think they'd follow up soon after being finished.  Oh well. I go in to see my med onc today for a one month \"T\" check.  I got my blood results in the mail and my Alk Phos is flagged as \"low\".  It dropped quite a bit since last May (and my reading in May was significantly lower than my reading from the year before).  I am kind of freaked about what this means.  Overall I seem to be tolerating the \"T\" okay.  I am very happy about that. Sounds like everyone is taking or has taken some interesting /fun trips - India, London, France, Hawaii, etc.  I may have to stow away in one of your suitcases! Have a good day everyone and I hope you are having better weather than we are! Kim",

Sonia - I think our cognitive issues are the result of both Tamoxifen AND stress.  I certainly feel out of it and apparently I really am......my youngest plays soccer and on game days families are to bring a snack for the team.  Well, guess who forgot the snack on Saturday?!  Yup, it was our turn and I had no idea because I had never transferred the info to our calendar.  Then yesterday I get a postcard in the mail from my son's orthodontist saying \"we missed you at your appt.\"  His appt. was Monday but it wasn't on the calendar.  Now I am worried about what I have forgotten to put on the calendar!  Before BC I NEVER forgot to put things on the calendar.  It is so frustrating and I truly am worried about what I am forgetting to do.  I used to be so organized and now I just can't seem to get it together.  I too just feel overwhelmed much of the time. I can't \"get it all done anymore\". Julie - sorry your mom is not doing well.  It sounds like you have a great surgeon who is taking good care of you.  Glad someone will be looking at your arm.  I think the lymphedema thing can be difficult to dx and not all docs really know enough about it.  I was told that, while rare, it IS possible to get lymphedema even if you only had a couple of nodes taken.   I still have swelling on my chest and underarm that I wonder about. Chicago - thanks for sharing the article.  Someone on this forum once said they felt like a survivor in that they survived their cancer treatments.  I do feel that way but I do not feel like I have survived cancer because I don't know if I have or not.  As for all the BC awareness - I am sick of it too.  There is no getting away from it.  I live with it everyday, everytime I see my flat chest or take my pill. Trayce - thinking about you and wondering how you are doing. Hugs, Kim",

Thanks for the support.  I am feeling somewhat better - mostly because I have decided to just ignore this whole tooth thing for now.  I am not in any pain.  If the dentist hadn't done the panoramic xray we wouldn't know anything was going on.  He did the xray cause he likes to do one every 3 -4 years.  I could deal with having a root canal, it is the fact that he said it probably can't be done and that I'll need some kind of surgery or extraction.  That is what has me freaked out.  I'd like to just leave it alone but I do worry about some kind of low lying infection messing with my immune system. I wish I there was a good support group here.  I currently live in central PA and there just isn't much here.  I miss being near a big city (I used to live 30 minutes outside of Charlotte, NC - that is home and I miss it and all it has to offer).  I will tell you my support group story another time.  I was in tears at the time but now I have to laugh because the dynamics of the group was so typical of the social dynamics of this area (can we say unfriendly?!). Julie - sorry to hear you have lymphedema but I'm glad you now know what is wrong and can get help with it.  140 tulip bulbs - your yard will be beautiful in the spring!  Good luck with the \"pill\".

My cousin gave me a aloe plant when I was there the week before last but it is dying (she repotted it and I think may have damaged the roots).  I thought it would be great to use during the rads.  I will have to look up how to make my own gel (Pagowens, I think, mentioned that she did that.  I didn't know that was possible so thanks for the idea.).  Maybe I can make some before the whole plant dies.  MagPag - I know what you mean about deoderant.  I was told to stop using it because it would be irritating but what am I supposed to do in 100 degree temps?!  My kids had a big swim meet yesterday (all day) and I was really worried smelling bad! Rocknesmom - I had a mx too (but no chemo). Patty - I envy your 10 minute drive.  That is great you have something so close to home.  Sonia - I know what you mean about friends \"losing interest\".  I also feel bad because I think I may have hurt a few of my friends feelings because I have had a tough time keeping up with emails/phone calls. Have a great evening everyone!  Hugs, Kim ",

I'm sorry that I can't remember this, but who besides Julie are still having rads and when will you be done (I think Julie is finshed mid-Sept). It must be a bit frustrating to see everyone finishing when you have more to go.  We will stick around here for you and help you through until the end of your rads! Donna - I hope you enjoy your Donny and Marie concert!  I had a crush on Donny and did get to see the Osmond Brothers in concert (at the Ohio State Fair) when I was around 10 too, Karen - my poor parents!  We were sitting so far from the stage that they looked like little specs.  I also remember seeing girls being carried out because they had fainted -LOL!  I'm experiencing that loss of innocence/freedom/whatever it is as well.  I am definitely in touch with my mortality now and find it very hard to think about the more distant future.  My DH will talk about \"when the kids graduate\" or \"when we retire\" (10 years until the youngest graduates from college and longer still to retirement) and I find I can't plan that far away - I need to live NOW, not wait until some future time.  It is weird.  Anyway, we are all together in these strange, new feelings and I'm sure we'll figure it out.  It will just take time.  Brenda, I think there is an emotional fatigue that comes with all of this and like you, I find I want to just put my head in the sand and forget or pretend it isn't real.  We will get through this ladies!!!! Thank you all for being there! Chicago1018 - I'll be joining your September \"T\" thread.  I got my rx today and can start when I'm ready (as in, the onc expects me to start within the week - yikes!).  To any of you ladies not taking \"T\" but taking one of the other hormonal therapies, please join us!  Our SE's will have some differences but also some similarities.  Have a great evening!  Hugs, Kim",

Julie - how are you doing?  How is you mom?  Is the infection getting any better? Eileen - you  mentioned your hair falling out - are you on \"T\"?  Thinning hair was one of the common SE's noted on the paper that came with my bottle. Sonia - I can't believe what that clerk said to you!  I would have been speechless.  I agree that you should post it on the \"Dumb things people have said to you\" thread. Glad to hear you had a nice visit with your kids! I read the book Anticancer right after my surgery.  It was a great book and I just recently started to review it so I can start making some of the changes he suggested. I liked that he had good backup for what he wrote and it wasn't a wierd \"diet\" book but things that make perfect sense.  So much of what he wrote I have heard about but now I have all that info in one place.  I would highly recommend it if you haven't read it (although it seems most of you have). Sonia - I will be looking for the Crazy Sexy Cancer Tips book  and I would love to hear about any other book suggestions.  Right after my dx someone loaned me a book called Thanks for the Mammogram that made me laugh out loud in places and another one called Reconstructing Natalie (this was a fictional story about a young women with BC.  It was fun to read, nothing heavy, just fun for the most part.) Spendygirl - there is a Septempber \"T\" thread.  Last I looked it was getting a bit buried so you may have to scroll down a bit to find it. Spendygirl, Sonia, Karen - I too worry about the cancer coming back. I have had some really rough nights worrying about a recurrance and about mets especially because my case was \"complicated\" as I have been told by my docs and because the \"ball\" was dropped and I was initially told my margins were clean when in fact they weren't.  This resulted in my rads starting much later than they should have.  So, despite the fact that I am done, I have found it very difficult to celebrate being cancer free because I feel like there is still some rogue cancer in me somewhere.  I am at high risk for a recurrance.  Right after my surgery I felt incredible relief and that my cancer was gone.  It is those darn messy margins that stress me.  I have to learn to live with it.  I think the best things we can do are take our antihormonal meds, go to our follow up appts, eat right, excercise and have as much fun as possible.  Actually I have read in several places how important exercise is in regards to keeping cancer at bay.  Speaking of which, I need to get out and walk before it gets too hot.  Have a great day and hang in there!  We will all be okay!

Linda - I had a unimx too so I know what you mean about being obvious when you go braless.  I got frustrated many times during the summer because I was lopsided (would've been easier if I'd had a bilat mx).  Fortunately I am a small B cup so I can hide it easier than if I was bigger.  I did also discover that some of my nicer summer tops hid things pretty well, I just had to wear the same outfits over and over when I went out.  At home I just wear big baggy shirts.  That was a great story about the angel/woman you met.  I believe that God puts certain people in our paths when we need them.

One of my tumors was ILC and it doesn't form a lump so I think it is difficult to feel .   My rad onc gave me a huge lecture on the importance of checking my chest regularly.  I just don't have confidence that I will feel anything until it is big.  I wonder if an MRI could be done of the flat side.  I'd almost be willing to pay for it myself just for the peace of mind.  I am also unhappy that my healthy breast only gets a once a year mammo. I like your idea of doing the Race for the Cure or the Avon 3 Day.   I have been thinking of doing something similar.  I really need to make exercise a habit and I thought focusing on something like that would help me be motivated as well as focus my BC energies.  I have been doing well at walking almost  everyday  this summer and in the last 3 weeks have really increased my walking distances.  I would like to start running again (ran when I was younger and my DH runs) but it would take some serious motivation that I haven't found yet. Julie - glad your heart is okay.  I am sorry that sleep is still a problem.  I wish I had something to offer that might help.  I did get a relaxation cd and loaded it on my iPod and I use it when I can't sleep.  It has been very helpful and I always fall asleep when I use it.  Have you tried something like that?  Are you still getting acupuncture?  I haven't figured out the cost of all of this yet nor have I seen an EOB from the rad onc  yet.  I imagine the washing of that gown daily is going to get expensive, lol!  I actually thought about bringing my own robe in. Tracye - sorry you are having to have a uterine biopsy.  I had to go through that last winter, before the BC dx.  The biopsy procedure really wasn't bad.  I was told to take 3 Ibuprofin  an hour before the procedure.  Yeah, the waiting game stinks.  Most likely it isn't anything.  My med onc said my periods would probably get weird and it is \"normal\" .  It is good they are checking you out though.

Also, I totally agree that we shouldn't have to wait over the weekend for results when they have the before hand. Anyway, I will be thinking of you this weekend and I pray that you can keep busy and will get good news on Monday! Sending a big cyberhug!  Kim",

Sonia - your trip sounds really interesting.  I am sorry you are feeling stressed about it.  Brenda is right, this stupid cancer robs us of so much!  I do understand how you feel about not being able to eat right, exercise, etc.  I have had similar feelings recently - went to a Halloween party and ate lots of junk, had 1 drink (my first since my dx), didn't get much exercise that week due to things going on and my juicer broke so no juice.  I really started feeling like everything was hopeless and the cancer was just having a heyday in my body due to all of that.  Logically I knew I didn't make sense but I still was upset.  Anyway, I hope you have a wonderful trip and that it distracts you so you can leave all this cancer stuff at home.  On another topic, you mentioned feeling achy and I read on another thread (think it was a \"T\" thread) that some ladies found taking vit.D helped with the achiness they were feeling. Brenda - I still have to get my flu shot so no one has said anything about the pneu. Shot.  The surprises just keep coming! Sending hugs to you all! Kim",

Sorry to hear about the nipple reconstruction.  I don't know much about reconstruction so I'm a bit confused.  Am I correct in that you had TE's for your reconstruction and were hoping to be able to make a nipple which I guess would involve some how manipulating the skin.  Since that won't work, he now wants to basically start over and do the lat flap (when I was considering reconstruction that is what I thought I'd have done)?  After all you have to go through with the TE's I'd hate to start the whole process over.  The lat flaps is major surgery.   If you do fat grafting, will that be jhust for the nipple?  I hope you can figure an easier way to get the nipples.  I can't believe it has almost been a year too.  Karen and I noticed that there is now a July Rads 2011 group.  We are all doing well.  Several of the ladies had some rocky moments over the winter with haivng to have more scans, etc.  Fortunately all seems to be okay.  The next hurdle we all seemed to face was gettting past our one year anniversaries and follow up appointments. We are all trying to find our new normal and figure out how to get on with life without feeling scared. So glad to hear from you!  Take care!  Kim",

      "Content": "Dec 14, 2010 05:23AM - edited Aug 20, 2013 03:24AM by Houndmommy I can't believe what I did yesterday evening - I totally went ballistic to my DH and DS.  I have been married 24 years and have never yelled at my DH that way.  It was like I was having an out of body experience almost.  Is it the \"T\" or is it all my pent up frustration and changes I've had to deal with?  Here is what happened.  Like most people, I carry a cell phone and I turn the ringers, etc. off when I go to appts. (several weeks ago I forgot to do this during a doctor appt and my phone rang - I was soooo embarrassed!).  The problem I have is that I forget to turn the ringer back on after the appt. This has all been happening a lot recently and twice my DH and DS have tried to call me to tell me I needed to pickup DS from practice that was either cancelled or over early and both times while I was just a few momments drive from my DS, my DH had to drive 30 minutes one way to get him.  I have felt terrible about this both times it has happened.  The bottom line is that I can't remember anything anymore and I can't seem to get my head above water no matter how hard I push and work.  And NO ONE in my family understands how frustrating this is to me and that I need them to pick up the slack for me.  I don't know why but I just can't get it together and I feel like my days are several hours shorter than they used to be.  I feel like I am just messing up constantly.  No matter how many lists, calendars, etc. I use I can't get things right.  I used to be a very together person.  So when I \"lost it\" last night it was because I was so frustrated with myself.  I walked in the door and my DH said, jokingly, \"I should get you a cell phone so I can reach you when I need to.\" and I went ballistic.  I apologized but I feel terrible about it and scared that it will happen again.  I hope this isn't a new SE of \"T\" as I am tolerating it okay.  I do wonder if my inability to get it together and remember anything is the \"T\", the cancer or both.  I also think part of the problem is that I am trying to take better care of myself and that takes a lot of time.  The reason I didn't exercise pre-BC as much as I should have was because it took too much time.  It is easier to eat a can of soup for lunch than make a salad - that takes time. Plus, all of these doctor appts!  I found out 2 weeks ago that I have mild truncal LE so I have been seeing a therapist and she is over an hour away round trip.  I am supposed to be doing all of this massage stuff everyday but I can't get it worked in.   I don't have time for all of this!  This afternoon I am off to my Gyn for my yearly check.  I am curious as to what she will say about my already enlarged uterus (this was discovered last December ).  Am I losing my mind?!

On a humorous note - when the doc asked how \"T\" was going for me I told her about my \"episode\" last evening and said that I was scared it would happen again.  She said, \"your family is scared too.  They called and gave me a heads up about what happened.\"  I guess some people might have been offended by her comment but it made me laugh.  AND, I remembered to turn my phone back on after the doc appt. !!!!!

I have got to get the \"Picking up the Pieces\" book. Sonia - how are you feeling today?  I hope you don't get any surprises with your MRI.  Do be prepared for things to show though.  ONe of the problems with using MRI's is that you get a lot of false positives.  When I was first dx'd they did an MRI right away to check for anything the mammo missed.  I ended up having 2 things biopsied in my non-cancer breast, both things were nothing.  I also had 2 more biopsies in my cancer breast - these were in a different quadrant than my original biopsies (they were trying to determine whether I could get a lumpectomy).  Those 2 spots were not anything either.  It did show my already dx'd cancers and 2 more suspicious areas in that same quadrant which did turn out to be cancer.  So, it showed a lot of suspicious places that were not anything at all.  Can you tell me what you have found about Tamoxifen and lobular cancer?  I had lobular as well and I hadn't heard that \"T\" wasn't as helpful.  I am 47 and I really hate the thought of shutting my ovaries down just yet.  But, I also don't want to revisit this cancer thing either.  Also, my doctor this morning said that the endometrial cancer risk with \"T\" is more of an issue for post-menopausal women.  If you are still getting periods you are shedding the lining which is good and you are still making progesterone which is protective (of course my cancer was pr+ so I'm not feeling very protected by that progesterone!).  I will be interested in whether your breasts seem less dense when you get your mammo.  That was one thing I thought might be a positive thing aboujt \"T\".  I hope you have a wonderful vacation!  Thank you all for being there!  Kim",

Hugs!  Kim",

Sounds like I'm not alone with my brain fog.  Hopefully it will pass - I'd like to have some clear moments before I start Tamoxifen as I am fearful that is going to play with my head as well! Julie - sorry you are having such a hard time sleeping as well as having tooth and sinus issues.   I hope they can fix your tooth sooner than the 16th! Linda - I'm thinking about you. Have a good weekend!  Kim",

Sonia - yes, I think it is self-preservation with our families.  My DH doesn't say much but I know the last 4 months have taken a toll on him.  I try very hard not to talk about my cancer with him even though sometimes I feel like it is the only thing I have to talk about.  I guess I try to protect him from worrying about the future but at the same time sometimes I really want to say the things that scare me out loud. Oh well, for today I am enjoying the fact that I don't have to go anywhere!  I am going to try to do a little cleaning - my house is falling apart!

Julie - Loved your question about only x-raying one testicle if it were a man!  I may ask my doctor that question.  I think that would really throw him for a loop!  Actually I don't think it is our docs as much as our insurance companies.  That said, if the doc is willing to take the time to write the insurance company as to why they should pay, I think we could get it covered.  I spoke to my insurance company last week about whether a prophylactic mx would be covered and it all depends on whether the doc can convince the insurance that it is necessary.  Boy, was I mad!  A mx is a lot cheaper than rads and chemo if I should get BC in my other breast. Julie -  In your post above, are you asking about metastasis?  If so, a very simple answer, is that it is when a cancerous breast cell gets into your blood or lymph system and then takes up residence in another area like your bones.  Keep in mind that not all cancerous cells are able to take up residence other places, many just die off/our immune system kills them/etc.  It sounds like you have a fun trip planned.  I hope you are able to rest, relax and reconnect! With October approaching I am noticing more and more BC awareness \"stuff\".  I am not sure how well I am going to handle it.  I don't like being reminded about BC everywhere I turn.  I have managed to keep it out of my head quite a bit but I am finding it more difficult as it is on tv, in the newspaper, in the grocery store, mall, etc.  It is wierd how I feel. Hope you all are having a good weekend! Hugs, Kim",

Tomorrow I go for a breast self-exam class at my Cancer Center.  I hope it gives me more confidence in my abilities to \"feel\" something.

Trayce - sorry your procedure was so painful.  I had one last February and it wasn't bad but for some reason my cervix was open enough that they didn't have to dilate me.  When do you get your results?  I'll be thinking of you! Karen - glad you had a good day on Saturday.  Thanks for the info on rib pain - I will look it up. Sonia - I can relate .  I hope you had a good weekend. Donna - I asked about my shooting pains on Friday but now I'm not sure that I emphasized it was my rib - Ugh!  Anyway, she did say the pains were \"normal\" and that they could last 6 months to a year.  She said they were nerves that had been irritated by surgery and rads.  I am glad to know that you asked about the rib pain since I am not sure that I asked the right question.  Glad you were able to get the biopsy right away.  I would not have wanted to wait.  I'll be thinking of you! Brenda - the breast exam class was really good.  I learned a lot and feel a bit better about knowing how to examine myself.  Now I just have to remember to do the exam each month!  I told the nurse that they should offer the class to all women.  They had \"breasts\" (they looked a bit like my silicone breast form) that had lumps in them and they had us do a breast exam on them .  If your cancer centers offer such a thing, go.  It is worth the time. Chey - I think it is good that you will be seeing a rad onc.  Even though your surgeon was happy with the margins, it is good to get another opinion.  I bet you won't need rads.  I think most women with mastectomies, clear margins, smaller tumors and no nodes don't need it.  But again, it is good to have a doc look at your specific case. I am reading a book about a woman who had BC and in the chapter where she discusses her feelings after treatment I felt like I was reading posts from you guys.  She experienced so many of the same things we are all feeling.  The following statement (she was crying to her DH) hit home....\"Nobody tells you how to deal with life after cancer!  I don't even know who I am anymore.   I'm not the same person.  How can I ever be the same person again after all this?\"  She also talks about being so tired physically and emotionally.  Several of you talked about lymphedema in several posts and I was wondering - those of you who had a MX and just one or two sentinel nodes taken, were you told that you were at a greater risk for lymphedema  because you had an MX (you lose a lot of lymph nodes when they remove the breast)?  I am a little confused now so I will have to go read the Lymphedema Forum.  At the breast exam class the nurse told me that even though I just had 2 SN removed, I was at a greater risk because of the MX.  I was never told this before.  Well, I need to try to get myself out the door for a walk on this cold, rainy day.  Hope you all have a good day!  Kim",

Wow, it has been awhile.  I have been dropping in and reading but haven't had time to post.  I\u2018ve been thinking of you all though.   I too was quite shaken and in tears when I heard about Elizabeth Edwards. Karen - I meant to post this earlier when you mentioned that you were concerned about the density of your breasts and the fact that the mammos, etc. missed things.  I too have dense breasts (okay, now it is only one dense breast).  My mammo only saw 2 tumors and then the other 2 were found after my mx.  One of the tumors that WASN'T  seen on the mammo was a 3.6cm DCIS.  I have small breasts - how was something that big not seen?!  Anyway, I mention this because I know how you feel about the docs not being able to see the problems.  I am still considering a prophalactic mx of my other breast because of this.   I did decide to wait until my next mammo though because I heard that Tamoxifen decreases breast density and I am wondering if the docs will be able to see things on my mammo easier now.  Are you taking Tamoxifen?  I can't remember.  I am sorry you are having to play the waiting game.  That stinks! Trayce - it has been good to hear from you.  I hope your recovery continues to go well.  My chest is still very sore in places and I find it very frustrating that it still hurts!  Wow, a year for rad issues to go away!  I was told recently that it takes 6 months for us to heal externally from surgery and another 6 months to heal internally.  I know this isn't what any of us wants to hear !  We all just want to feel good again! Good luck with your decision to go back to work.  Sonia - I'm glad you had a good trip.  It must have been great to see all that you got to see.    Sorry you have the MRI follow up hanging over your head.   You asked if we thought you should have a mammo too - I was under the impression that the MRI's see things the mammos miss so it sounds like by having an MRI you are getting looked at thoroughly.   I would prefer to have MRI's to mammos (since my mammo missed half of my tumors).  I will be thinking of you on the 13th.  Hang in there.

Julie - hope you are having a nice time away and that your sinus infection didn't ruin your fun!  Glad to hear the counselor has been helping you.

Brenda - Okay, I admit that I too look at the obits and anytime I see the death of a woman under the age of 70 I look to see if she had BC.  I will look into the book you mentioned. Off to bed.  Have to be up early (again ) for a swim meet - Ugh! I think about you all a lot.  Take care!  Kim",

My radiation was going to be staring 7 weeks post surgery (I ultimatley started 9 weeks post surgery).  I was soooo upset - many sleepless night and lots of tears.  It is frustrating when the doctors drop the ball on our care. At this point you should have someone order the test.  It may not take 3 weeks to get it back.  If it comes back as no chemo then you can start rads right away.  You will be at the 6 week mark though so I wonder if you should ask if they can do the rads set up for you so that if your oncotype is low you can start rads right away and will not have lost anytime.  If your oncotype vomes back high then you start chemo right away.  I don't know when they normally start chemop but your are still within a 6 week window.  Keep in mind some ladies don't start chemo right away due to surgical issues, reconstruction issues, etc. and the same can be said for rads. Good luck! Hugs, Kim",

Thanks for the support!  It is soooo helpful.  I felt pretty bad today - both tired from lack of sleep and depressed.  Had a tough time keeping the tears at bay.  I feel a bit better this evening.  I have had about 2 weeks of sleep difficulties but last night was the worst.   I hope tonight is better.  I'm not sure why I am having such a difficult time.  If it continues I may have to see the doctor for some help.  No doubt  much of my depression/inability to cope is due to being tired.  Julie - I feel for you and your lack of sleep.  That is one of the things I worry about with the \"pill from hell\" (love that name!).  I just don't function well emotionally without good sleep. Sonia - I loved your post.  I will keep telling myself that I DON\"T HAVE BC ANYMORE!  I also applaud you for letting the doc know of your frustration!  Way to go!!!  Also - you aren't old!!!  Unfortunately I can relate to the itchy! LOL! Julie - it is okay to have a pity party and I think this is a good place to have it - we understand.  You have been through A LOT of life changing things all at once. Eileen and Waltersren - you are in the home stretch!  Congrats!  I already have off and on leg cramp issues and take magnesium but I am going to have to be more diligent with  it.  I think it is a good idea to start before you take the \"pill from hell\".  Donna - you can get magnesium with epsom salt baths.  Not sure how much/how often.  I have also read about an epsom salt cream that does the same thing.  Thanks for pointing out that we will start taking Tamoxifen in the fall so at least we won't be dealing with the full heat of summer to go with our hot flashes and night sweats. Karen - After tomorrow I have 8 tx left we'll finish the same week.  Mine are full treatments though - no boosts for me.  Chicago1018 - I have heard good things about accupuncture helping hot flashes - nice that you have that option.  I am going to try to find an accupuncturist around here.  I just think it is great that you have the integrative med. option (I know I keep saying that but I sooooo wish more places offered that). Wish we could all meet for coffee somewhere.  I'd love to have a local support group with you ladies. Many hugs!  Kim",

Twenty-one down and only 7 to go!!!!  My skin is holding up well.  I think one thing that has helped me is the fact that I haven't worn a bra since starting.  I am smaller breasted so my other boob is comfortable going braless and I am a SAHM.  While I try to dress nice when I am out and about, I don't have to be all dressed up and worry about clients and coworkers.  I do occassionaly get stares because with most things I wear, it can be obvious that I only have one boob.  Anyway, today someone gave me some hand-me-down camis with prosthesis pockets and when I tried them on - OUCH!  My skin is very sensitive right now.  I didn't realize just how sore I am until I tried putting something tight on (ie. the band on the shelf bra of the cami).   So, my hat is off to you ladies having to wear bras ,etc. for work and support.  That is no doubt adding to your discomfort. I'm starting to feel more tired but still no exhaustion like some of you are experiencing.  I think the worst for me is this stupid brain fog - it is driving me crazy!  It is probably worse because I am more tired.  I just feel totally out of it. Karenlen - most of my discomfort is under the skin like you are experiencing.  I feel sore like I did after surgery.  I was told this is normal (no surprise there, lol!) and due to the swelling and inflammation caused by the rads.  I am so glad yo got some things to help you.  It is soooo frustrating to be ignored by our doctors! Linda - Sory to hear your throat is a problem again. Spendygirl - I had those sharp pains early in treatment but they have disappeared over the last couple of weeks.  Hopefully yours will too. Marita15 - Thanks for the Tamoxifen tip!  I will ask my onc about that when I get my rx next week.  Sonia - my rad onc told me that I should expect the SE's to continue to get worse for 1-2 weeks after my last tx and then it will be another  3-4 weeks of healing.  Jeez, that puts me at the end of Sept before I recover from this radiation experience!  And by then I will be taking the \"pill from hell\" so I may never get to feel better!  On a lighter note, I had to chuckle thinking of the doctor running the opposite direction when he saw you! Julie - I am so sorry you are having such sleep issues and so many hot flashes.  I've read several places on BCO that some people have quite a bit of success reducing their hot flashes with accupuncture.  Maybe you should check into that. Have a good evening ladies!  Hugs, KIm",

Julie - I cried all the way to the \"spa\" today too!  Fortunately I got there a little early and had some time to sit in the car and pull myself together.  I hope the accupucture works for you.  Please let us know how it goes.  Karen mentioned Gabapentin and I have read about it being helpful on other threads so keep that in mind if the accupuncture doesn't help. Some people also find antidepressants can help as well. So speaking of sleeping....A couple of you mentioned Ativan which reminded me that my family doc gave me a script for Lorazepam (which I think is the same thing as Ativan) when I was first dx's back in April.  I filled the script but never needed to take it.  So, I'm thinking now might be the time to take it but I can't remember if it is okay to just take on an as needed basis.  So if I need it to help me sleep for a few nights, can I then just stop and then take it again if I have issues again later on?  I hate taking meds of any kind (another reason 5 years of \"T\" is going to be a challenge) so I tend to be very conservative about them and also don't know much about them. Off to bed and hopefully some sleep.  Wishing you all a good nights sleep! Kim",

Patty - how many tx do you have left?  We will certainly hang around til everyone is finished.  Julie has a way to go yet too so you aren't alone.  Also, I notice that some of the older radiation threads pop up and I assume it is members of that group checking in with each other.  We can do the same. Julie - Congrats on getting a better nights sleep!  I will be anxious to hear if the accupuncture helps.  Will you need more than one treatment or should one take care of things?  Also, if you have to smoke then one a day is certainly so much better than a pack !  Keep up the good work!  I have never smoked but I would imagine the stress of all you have been through would make it harder to stop so I think the fact that you only smoke one is great. Susan - I think it is great that you have been able to use your time off with this dreaded disease for some good.  I know my perspective and thoughts on things have changed.  I want to have more fun and be less uptight about silly things like keeping my house clean! Spendygirl - glad you have found some relief from you wounds.  I guess that is the advantage to not having a breast during this process - my chest is flat so everything gets plenty of air!  I am itchy though!  I too hope that our little group can stay in touch.  I would be happy to start a September tamoxifen/antihormonal thread (I know not everyone is taking \"T\" ) or we can jump on the August thread.  Let me know what you all think. Have a good night everyone!  I'm going to slather on the emu oil, take my benedryl and head to bed. Hugs, Kim",

Okay, so DH says to me this evening, \"how did it feel not to have to go to radiation?\"  I said \"I still had to make the drive and go to the same building to see the med onc so it really didn't feel any different.\"  He says, \"No, I mean how does it feel not to have the toxic effects of the radiation.\" Uhhh?!  Sometimes he just doesn't listen!  I have told him that you feel nothing getting the rads and that the negative effects would continue for about a week after I was done and THEN things would start to clear up. It took nearly 5 weeks  before I had a drastic skin change.

On Wednesday night I noticed that a 3 x 3 area under my arm is REALLY red and hurts a lot.  It is definitely burned.  Feels like a really bad sunburn.  So when they tell you your skin continues to change for a week after rads, they weren't kidding! It is still painfully burned.  The other wierd thing is that I occassionally get these itchy feelings in the rad area but scratching them doesn't do any good.  It is like the itch is deep under the skin. It is only happening in a couple of areas on my chest and it is sooo annoying.  Also, how long until the sweeling goes down?   I am now 10 days out from my last tx - I hope things start getting better soon! For any of you that had a mx and rads, I have a question.  After my mx I was very numb in the chest and underarm area which is \"normal\" but I did notice that the numbness began to subside a bit with time in some areas.  The rads caused all the numbness to come back - I feel the way I did after surgery.  Does anyone know if the numbness will lessen like it did before or did the rads make it permanent? Sonia - I have found myself with a similar attitude about the future.  It is important to do things NOW, sieze the moment!  I have a real hard time thinking too far down the road. Julie - I am so sorry to hear about your friend. Donna - Congrats on getting that first pill down!  I took mine a few minutes ago - scary! I hope everyone is having a restful and weekend.  School and sports start Tuesday for us in this household so summer is almost over.  It certainly has been a strange one and I look forward to Fall and getting my life back to its new \"normal.

I have missed all of you!  Last week was something else!  I felt terrible - don't know if it is SE's from rads, Tamoxifen or a combination of both.  I am guessing that is a combination of the both on top of the stress of school and activities starting again.  I still don't have my \"get up and go\" back.   My skin is looking better.  Still some swelling, redness and soreness but less than last week.  My skin doesn't hurt, it is just flaky so I'm still slathering on the cream but not as much as before.   I haven't worn a bra yet but I think I could do it without issue now.  Spendygirl and Sonia - Not long after my surgery I thought seriously about getting a tattoo (I've wanted to get one for a number of years) when this was over and then I got my rad tattoos - they hurt!! So then I rethought the whole tattoo thing. LOL!  I also have no idea where to go to get one either.  But if you lived near me I would go with you and maybe actually do it!  Let us know what you decide to get! Julie - Happy Birthday!  I hope it has been a good day!  I laughed so hard when I read your story about the rad onc and you asking if \"normal\" was the only word he knew!  Too funny!  I think  it is good that your med onc is having you wait to start the \"pill\".  I started 1 1/2 weeks post rads and as I said earlier, I don't know if what I am experiencing is related to \"T\" or rads.  Any news on your chest xray? Patty and Marilyn - Congrats on being done!!!!!  Julie, are you the last one to finish?  Will everyone really be done tomorrow?!  Hugs to all of you!  I couldn't have gotten through the rads part of the journey without you.  Thanks for making it easier to get through!

Tracye - my last rad was almost 4 weeks ago (wow!  I can't believe it has been that long already.) and I have started having sharp pains ocassionally and am very tender under my arm.  As for the path report....I spent many a day and night in July and August researching my report (which was a mess as far as I was concerned.  It was so poorly written that I was scared the lab had messed up.  Every doc I saw told me how complicated my report/situation was.).  Anyway, that report has caused me more stress and tears and depression.  I am trying to stay away from it. Karen - Sorry you have had such a rough time lately.  I am appalled at your ER experience. I am sure you needed to have a \"good cry\".  I also think it is \"normal\" and healthy to hit that point during recovery (I am waiting...).  I recently spoke to a 2 year BC survivor and she said when her tx was finally over and the kids went back to school and life slowed down a bit that she spent a week crying almost non-stop. So, I'm thinking this is part of the healing process. Pat - you said something that I found very helpful.  You said that it will take at least as long to heal and recover as the treatment took.  I think that is great insight.  I have become very frustrated at the fact that I still don't have my energy back.  I am trying to be more patient.  My journey began in late April and ended 4 months later so I need to give myself at least until January.  It is helpful for me to have that perspective.  Thank you! I continue to think about you all a lot.  You are a blessing to me. Hugs, Kim    ",

Boy, that word \"normal\" will never be the same for us, will it?  Every time I hear it or say it, I notice the word and have a little chuckle.  It is kind of like an inside joke.  Yes, Julie, it does seem like a four letter word. Tracye, I had a MX but I still worry about a recurrence since my margins weren't clear and since there is still breast tissue there.  Unfortunately I don't think there is any getting around the concern for any of us.  I am hugely worried about my other breast and very frustrated that it won't be followed closely.  I get very angry if I think about it too much.  These insurance companies are stupid sometimes! Karen, sorry you are getting sick so much.  Colds are miserable.  Everything we have been through really takes a toll on our immune systems. Good question about what to call ourselves.  I am out and about more and am seeing people I haven't seen since dx'd and they ask me questions I don't really know how to answer.  They don't understand that BC isn't \"cured\".  One woman I spoke with last night had bladder cancer last year.  She had surgery, they got all the cancer and now it is over for her.  She wasn't getting it that I can't say I'm \"cured\".  I think that we are supposed to consider ourselves survivors now but like you all I don't feel like I survivor.   Like Pat said, we survived treatment but we don't really know if we have survived BC.  I like your \"Cancer Lifestyle\" and \"Cancer Lifer\" terms.   The other thing I struggle with, when I am at a doctor giving a health history (have been a few times recently for things unrelated to cancer) is whether to say \"I HAVE cancer\" or that \"I HAD cancer\".  I guess I will ask the onc these questions when I see here next.  I will see my surgeon for my first real follow up in November - I'll be getting a chest  xray and blood work then  - I wonder if I will feel like the cancer is gone after those tests (assuming they are fine).   I am going to lunch with a group I belong to this afternoon and I dread the questions. Have a nice day and hang in there! Kim",

I just have to laugh!).  Anyone else have a rash?  Mine look like little pimples.  Oaky, on to the gown rant...why can't they provide something that covers better?  If I were doing this in the winter I'd take my own robe or I'd freeze to death!  We change and then sit in a waiting room with other patients, men and women in a similar state of undress - embarrassing!  I wish I had thought of it earlier in the treatment and I probably would have gotten a summer robe to wear. Spendygirl - those stabbing pains I said I had early in treatment but went away?  Well I spoke too soon.  They started again today.  Just a few for a couple of hours after my treatment. Karen - I can't remember anything either!  Half the time I can't find the words I need  during a conversation.  My kids just laugh at me. Julie - let us know how the accupuncture goes.  I hope it works for you!  I have had a few minor heart palps and I think they have just been anxiety related.

Brenda - good luck on your return to work as well!  I read Anticancer during my recovery from surgery.  It is an excellent book and I recommend everyone read it.  It is well written and seems to be backed up well with solid research.  It really pulled together so much I have heard about over the years about our health and environment.  Wonderful news that you don't have to take \"T\" but I know what you mean about worrying about the fact that you aren't taking it.  I felt that way when I found out I didn't have to have chemo.  It was such a relief but frightening at the same time.  We want to feel like we have done everything possible to kill all the cancer cells. Marita - thanks for your positive post and for the reminder about splitting the \"T\" pill.  Good to know we have some options if SE's are bad.  I will be asking my onc about splitting the pills when I see her this week.  Oh, and your dream - how funny!!! Linda - congrats on being done!  I hope you have been feeling better and that your throat issues are gone for good! Karen - thanks for pointing out that info on drug interactions with \"T\".  That is one BIG list - is there anything that doesn't interact with it?!  How sad to be on it the whole time only to find out later that you were taking a drug that intereferes!  Well, off to bed (and benedryl), Good night!  Kim",

Is anyone noticing that their radiated area is getting more sore and tight as time goes on?  My range of motion is actually decreasing (guess I should start all those stretching exercises again).

Julie - how did your heart scan go?  Is everything okay? LovesCranes - I am a SAHM too.  My boys are 12 (6th grade) and 15 (9th grade).  I really haven't given this whole prognosis question much thought.   I never asked and no one ever told me anything - ignorance can be bliss!  It seems most things are in percentages and those stats just don't mean much to me anymore.  Statistically I shouldn't have BC.  I have heard that there are milestones that decrease the likelihood of it returning.  The 2 year mark and the  5 year mark are significant but there are just no guarantees.  It is that uncertainty we have to live with.  I try to remind myself that no one has a guarantee on how long they will live - anyone could be in a car accident tomorrow.  I think those of us who have been through cancer have just been given a glimpse of our mortality that others don't get.  When you are healthy it is easy to think we will live a long time.  I have a question - how often is your doc doing a mammo/scan of your healthy breast?  I thought I would have a mammo of my healthy breast at the 6 month mark but apparently my doc isn't doing that.  I was just curious as to what other docs were doing and am trying to decide if I should insist on something (personally I'd like an MRI since mammos don't show everything in my dense breast).

This afternoon I had a woman say something that I did find annoying.  I was at a luncheon and for some reason I mentioned that I spent the summer undergoing tx for BC.  THe woman next to me goes on to say that she had both of her breasts REMOVED about 15 years ago.  As I was about to ask if she had a family history she goes on to tell me that she had very large breasts and that she had a cyst removed and at the same time had a breast REDUCTION.  Sorry, but a reduction just isn't the same as having your entire breast cut off.  I guess I am more sensitive than I thought because that comment p****ed me off.  Oh well.

Sonia - sorry to hear your itchiness is still bad. Is there anything you can put on it to help?   Mine pretty much went away, I just feel bruised/sore all over the chest area again.   It is my unclear margins that worry me quite a bit as well.  I feel like a recurrance just waiting to happen.  I know the radiation should have taken care of anything remaining but it is hard not to feel worried.    I am learning that  I am emotionally fragile.  I just can't handle what I used to take in stride.   I think that we all could use a long stretch of time where everything is just boring - no drama, no problems.  Here's hoping that 2011 will bring us lots of uneventfulness (unless it is a happy event!) and no extra doctor appointments!  I am sick of doctors.

Sonia - sorry \"T\" is causing you such problems.  I would encourage you to ask your doc about how much benefit you are really getting from it.  It seems like when I read other threads about it that there isn't much benefit.  I am kind of baffled by that.  Also, if you go to the alternatives thread, some women seem to be having success managing their hormones with other things. Patty - I too have been worried that I \"T\" isn't working as my SE's are not bad.  I definitely have hot flashes but they are very manageable and don't occur often.  I have been on \"T\" for 2 months and have had my period, on time, both months.   I feel like we can't win on this drug - if we have SE's we are miserable and if we don't have SE's we have to worry that it doesn't work for us.  Somewhere I read that some women call it \"damoxifen\".  Good luck with your decision.  It isn't an easy one. I am finding myself more frustrated and angry lately.  I should probably go for counseling as I have found myslef mad at tv personalites, LOL!  Several days ago I was watching the cooking channel and found myself really angry at the Barefoot Contessa and Paula Dean.  The Contessa was making chocolate truffles, etc. and I felt so angry that she could eat all of that and I can't (or at least I shouldn't and when I cheat I feel guilty).  Paula Dean was making all kinds of unhealthy things too.  I guess all of my dietary changes are getting to me.  I just want to not have to think about everything I put in my mouth and not feel guilty because I ate a cracker.  Guess I should stop watching the cooking channel!

Emotionally I have no idea where I am.  Right after Thanksgiving I felt great but the stress of Christmas pulled me back down and I'm having trouble digging out.  I'm not depressed, just blah (of course the cold, dreary weather here in PA doesn't help).  I feel like I just go through the motions. I like the door analogy too. Not helping is the fact that I have pretty significant jaw pain which I want to believe is the result of a lot of dental work I had last year that has caused my bite to be off but of course I am terrified it is bone mets.  I haven't gone back to the dentist yet because I just don't have time.  I swear, when I was dx'd with BC someone made my days 20 hours long instead of 24.  I just can't seem to get it all done!  Oh well, I'd better get back to all I have to do.....  Have a good day!",

On a different topic - Karen, my vision seems to have worsened since starting \"T\" too.  How long does it take cataracts to form?  I saw my eye doc in Sept. and my eyes were fine other than needing a new prescription (slight change so I didn't do it).  I can't imagine cataracts forming that fast!   I hope you get another eye appoint. soon. Sonia - have you asked your doc about the ILC/Tamoxifen issues that surfaced in the fall?  I saw my med onc Tuesday and asked her about it.  She wasn't familiar with the study and then gave me her reason that I shouldn't be concerned.  I felt better until I realized (on the drive home) that her reason made no sense in my case!  She said that the oncotype test indicated that my tumor would respond to \"T\".  That is all well and good BUT the oncotype test only tested ONE of my 4 tumors (the biggest) and it was NOT the ILC!  So her reason not to worry doesn't work for me - Ugh! Have a good evening everyone! ",

Great site!  I was dx'd in April 2010 and I have 2 boys (14 and 11).  My biggest worry has been about my kids.  So far they seem to be handling it well. My 14 yo is a typical teenager and is too caught up in himself to  be concerned about me (that is okay with me - I don't want him to worry although it would be nice if he'd be a bit more sensitive to the situation) and my 11 yo doesn't say much so I worry that he is holding it all in.  He will be going to a camp next week and I found out one of the other kids there has a mom going through the same thing so maybe he will talk to her. I will help where I can but I am still early in this journey so still have a lot to learn.  I think it is great that you have created this site so we moms won't feel so alone.  Kim",

I do need radiation because my margins were close.  I am thinking of getting a 2cd opinion on pathology - would have \"stuff\" sent to Johns Hopkins but 1) I don't want to deal with this anymore - I'm tired and probably depressed. 2) Will my slides and stuff get lost? 3) I meet with the radiologist Thursday.  What if I start radiation before I get the 2cd opinion back - I don't want to put off treatment any longer.

How much does radiation help decrease the odds of recurrance? Have a good day! Kim Unimx 5/17/10 - IDC, ILC, DCIS, LCIS found. Oncotype DX 14. All tumors are ER/PR+ and HER2-.

I would be curious to know what your rad onc says about the delay. Hugs, Kim",
