I guess i'm not surprised this has been one thing after another. Boy what a journey! I hope to chat with all of you and make some friends who know what i'm going through.

My daughter is 13 and son is 8 will be 9 in june. They're a handful and now the teen years are kicking in. lol I love reading the stories with the teen girls and everything they try. We are all guilty at some point in those years of trying anything to get away with it! haha! Have a great weekend everyone! HUGS AND KISSES! Suebee",

I've been waiting on the third onco test to be ran to get a number and guess what? no number! It came out inconclusive again!!!!!! Three times, who'd thought?! I'm speaking with my onc. tomorrow to see if there's any other way other than chemo. I doubt it but there's always hope. Anyone had a oopher.? I was just wondering that may be an option. My husbands friend sister had one and they say its age her 10 yrs.? I am soo uneducated about all of this? I guess we'll have to see tom. I have returned to work and it's been alright. I just feel i'm in a different world now. anyone else? I just really don't care about the place anymore and i've been there 15 yrs.. It used to be my life, litterally! Now i just go to see my customers. Is that bad? I've told some that i may do chemo and they've said i'm a beautiful person regardless of hair. How come i can't think that way? Or else they just want a good haircut? lol Anyways won't keep you all, hope everyone is well, and you're in my prayers! HUGS AND KISSES! Suebee",

CANCER SUCKS, TOTALLY! Haven't had to see a doctor in a while which actually feels weird but will go back next month for check ups. I just have one question? Did anyone go back to work and hate it? I have been loyal and committed to this salon for 16 yrs. and managed it for 12. I stepped down after i was dx from management and continued to  work as a stylist went back part time and dread going through the door. I dont know what it is? anyone else out there? Now i'm debating on switching salons? Anyways trying to catch up on all the posts. Talk to you guys soon. Take care. Youre in my thoughts and prayers!   HUGS AND KISSES! Suebee ",

My son turned 9 this past Tues. and had a championship baseball game on Wed. ( they won!!! ) Planned a big party for him this weekend, so had a sleepover last night and 8 boys over to swim today. Of course good Ohio weather we had a tornado warning and ended up in the basement for about an hour. haha. It cleared up enough for them to be able to swim awhile. All was good. Anyways just wanted to let you know I have chosen not to have the expanders moved and replaced, but to go ahead with the implants. No matter what size i'll end up. So surgery is tomorrow and after the implants are placed i'll have my ovaries removed. So i guess i'm in for a big day tomorrow? Just wanted to check in and try to catch up on some threads. Hope everyone is well and i will check in soon, those boys wore me out, gonna try to get some rest. HUGS AND KISSES! Suebee",

Hopefully all is well?  Well where to begin? I had my 4th surgery 3 or 4 weeks ago, went well ,and still recoupping. Went to see my ps a week ago and found out i have yet another surgery. The implants he put in are to small. I have rippling and some scar tissue sticking out and a dog ear on my left breast. I heard he was the best around now i'm starting to wonder?  I guess you gotta do things a few times to get it right? My husband does not want me to have surgery again but i should have it done right. There gonna be with me forever. Had an oophorectomy also and the hot flashes and night sweats are miserable! Taking celexa and tamox. They make me sick to my stomach! I'm just depressed! I don't think the surgeries were half as bad as i'm feeling now! Not sure if it's becuz i have time to let everything sink in or not. where as before i had to worry about what comes next? THIS JUST SUCKS! All in all my family and friends have been godsents to me. I shouldn't complain others have it worse off. I just don't understand why? why anyone has to go through any of this? UGHHH!  Well i hope you all are taking care i will check in soon and more often. its just been really hard! HUGS AND KISSES! suebee ",
