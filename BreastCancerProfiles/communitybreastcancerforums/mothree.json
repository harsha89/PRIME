      "Content": "mothree wrote: I posted a little bit about my story following some other posts, but probably should have started my own. Months ago, I felt a sharp pain behind my right nipple. It woke me up from my sleep. I sort of monitored it and it never came back, until a few weeks ago. My dr. noticed some thickening on that right side, but no hard lumps. I do have dense breasts with those oval type fibroids or cysts, whatever they are. Anyway, went in for my mammogram and ultrasound today and they took extra pictures w/another set to magnify it. The dr. came in and said that there was some calcification on that right side that was also there back in 2013, although, I was never told that in 2013, just that my images were normal then. When he saw them today, he said to have them checked again in 6 months. He also said that I have one simple cyst and a spot that looked solid. I don't recall him calling the other one a cyst exactly. He said he was unsure, but that it didn't really have the characteristics of a cancerous spot, however, he said I needed a biopsy. #1, I'm extremely worried about the calcification that I never knew about. Shouldn't they have told me, or is calcification normal? They never said to have it monitored or anything back in 2013. #2, I'm concerned because of the sharp pain I get once and awhile that is definitely not normal for me. How many others have sharp stabbing pain in a specific area and have it be benign? And shouldn't I get the calcification checked during my biopsy of the one solid spot, rather than wait 6 months? I'm not comfortable waiting. #3, The dr. didn't seem 100% sure of what he saw. I thought cysts, even complex ones would be easy to diagnose on either an ultrasound or mammogram, especially w/all the pictures they took. When I asked him what the difference was between the solid spot he saw and one that would be cancerous, he said that mine was oval and more light in color, not a black spot on the image, for instance. I'm hoping he's just being cautious by saying I need a biopsy, but in the back of my mind, I can't help but think the worst. My biopsy in on the 10th and I've already had a bad stomachache all day from worrying. Not sure how I'm going to cope. my anxiety is off the charts. So sorry for this long post. Hoping for anyone who can share a similar story with a good outcome to keep me thinking positive. No bad outcomes, please. Thank you! Log in to post a reply",

It's very hard for me to control my anxiety level in situations like this, but the more I read other posts on here, the more I see I'm not alone. I was able to pull up my report online during the night and two of my questions were sort of answered. It looks like the calcifications haven't changed since 2013, so I think that's good. And the radiologist did state that his findings could represent a cyst containing debris or possible fibroadenoma. So I'm going to take that as a possible sign that he's not initially thinking cancer. I know he was sort of saying that, but honestly, most of what he was saying is a blur. Again, I know anything is possible, but I'll take thinking positive over negative any day. Yes, I can see why people wouldn't stick around. Would love to hear from others who have similar symptoms as mine though and is also in the waiting stages. The waiting is definitely the hardest. As a side note, being adopted makes it tough too. What I do know about my birth family is that most have not lived all that long, but I haven't been able to confirm if BC runs in the family. Seems like mostly stomach related issues. Recently heard that my birth mother may have passed away and she was early 60's, but haven't been able to confirm if it's true and if so how. I've always been so on top of my health due to not knowing, and even got a baseline mammogram when I was 35 (I'm 47 now). But I also worry over pros and cons of getting yearly mammograms, and now they are recommending I get another one in 6 months for the calcifications. Stress is horrible for our health, and that's all I do lately. I'll report back after my biopsy for anyone interested or possibly dealing with the same symptoms. Thanks again, Ariom! ",

I know I've read that we should lower caffeine intake, red meat and sodium. Not sure we can totally get rid of it, but I think dietary changes can help somewhat. I haven't been on the Evening Primrose long enough to know if they help. Sorry.",

I'm in my 40's now, and it almost seems like the pain on that side has gotten worse certain times of the month. I'll go a couple months where it's not so bad, and then I'll have one pretty painful one where the tissue is definitely more swollen. I was diagnosed with fibrocystic/dense breasts years ago. I would maybe get a second opinion to ease your mind. You may have to get the baseline mammogram at a younger age so that they can monitor changes better, but that's obviously up to your dr. Sounds like you're doing the right things w/coffee and supplements. Hope you get some answers!",

I assume the solid looking one means complex? He didn't really call it a cyst, but solid. Dr. did say that the image was light in color vs. dark or black which could indicate benign, as well as oval in shape vs. irregular, but he still recommended a biopsy. I'm stressed beyond belief. If I were in your shoes, I'd ask for a biopsy now or at least a second opinion, but then again, I'm horrible at waiting. I have to know now. Better safe than sorry. On the flip side, things change over 6 months too. Maybe the 2nd opinion is the way to go. I hope all turns out to be nothing.",

I have read that having them can increase our chances, but not sure if that is due to them turning cancerous, or mistaking one for the other. I have also read that they are more common in woman under 30 but I'm over 40 and was just diagnosed with one. Take care!",
