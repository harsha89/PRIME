I send you a BIG HUG. I lost my precious mother on the same day I had my mastectomy, Sept.14,2010. She was in the waiting room and the surgeon gave her the good news that he had gotten all of my cancer and then after waking up in my hospital room my husband was the only one standing at the foot of my bed and he told me that my mother was happy and doing fine after hearing the news that my cancer was gone, and then about 45 minutes later she had a stroke and a blood clot in the brain.I had to be having a bad dream and had not woke up yet. It was not a dream. My mother and I were very close.She was my best friend. She loved life. She was going to be there for me after my surgery and help me get through this long journey. I keep asking WHY? I always thought things happened for a reason. I thought if something bad happens that later something good would come from it. I am still struggling with all of this and it helps sometimes to share my story  with  others who have lost someone dear to them.I do understand how you feel. Talking about it does help and and whenever you feel the need to cry just let it out no matter where you are. It is good to let those feelings out. I will keep you in my prayers.",

I guess next week I will be trying to find a PT that does the myofacial release. I am having a bad day with the pain. I agree to try to keep this thread going. I know sometimes when I am having a bad day I don't feel like posting, but I drop in and read some of the same post just to remind me I am not the only one with this horrible pain so maybe we can just pop in and post \"bad day\" or \"good day\" or do the bump thing. I hope that does not sound a little crazy. Ya'll have any other ideas?",

Then time went by and I woke one morning I woke up and it looked like my nipple had been cut but it did not hurt so I thought it was a skin problem. Time went by and there was a crusty discharge and sometimes it would get inflamed. I did research and learned a lot about paget's. It started Oct.2009 and I went to my primary doctor and asked her if this could paget's and she was not familiar with it. The pain got worse and my nipple stayed very red and inflamed. I went to other doctors and finally they did a biopsy August 23, 2010. There needs to be more awareness about Paget's because it is treated like a skin problem and so it is hard to diagnose so I had to keep pushing and trying to get answers. I am sorry to babble on. Try to stay positive and I hope you get a good report. Please let me know and whatever happens there is a lot of good support on this site. I did not know about this site until afterwards so it was then I had to reach out and ask questions and the women here were so helpful. Still babbling, I'm sorry. You will be in my prayers.",

I thought it was because of my implants being too big.The pain got so bad I had to do something so I asked my PS if I could go smaller and he tells me that I could go bigger but not smaller. That made no sense to me. I had been through a revision which did not help. My pain was getting worse and 24/7. I went for a second opinion with another PS and he said I could go with smaller implants and some fat grafting. I went from 500cc to 300cc on August 1,2012. I felt so much better and I went to Vinnie Myers at NOLA May 15th and had my nipples tattooed. I felt whole again and was getting my life back, then BAM!!! about a month ago I started having some mild discomfort with tightness. Now within the last 2 weeks my pain is getting worse, back to the way it was with my first implants. Tightness, pain in my scar area and the pain and bulk feeling under my arms. I thought I did everything right this time but I guess not.Will this ever end? It will be 1 year August 1st.",

I woke up one morning and it looked like my nipple had been cut and it was red but did not hurt. I did not really think anything about it until it started to discharge. I did some research about Paget's because I remembered a email that was passed around back in 2001 where a woman had this problem and it was treated as a skin problem but it did not get better and she also posted some pictures as it got worse. She went for a mammogram and it was clean. Later she had a biopsy and it came back as Paget's. My story was just like her story. I went to my primary doctor and asked her if this could be Paget's and she sent me to a breast surgeon and he treated it like a skin problem and told me it was not Paget's. I went back to him 2 more times and then my nipple started throbbing so I went to my GYN and he said it was time for a biopsy. I let the same breast surgeon do the biopsy because he was good but he was not real familiar with Paget's because it is rare and it came back as Paget's.It was caught early but I did have to have a double mastectomy but no treatments. I am not sure about the other pain you are having.My situation was I felt something was wrong and having the right information I knew I had to keep pushing forward to find out what was going on. If you don't feel like you get the right information from one doctor there is nothing wrong in going for a second opinion. This site is a place to get good infromation and know the right questions to ask your doctor. I wished I would have found this sitebefore I had my mastectomy but that has passed and that is a whole other story. I hope things go good with your doctor visit and you do not have cancer.",

That was in 2010 and and I am still struggling and having problems. I also wanted to tell you that if you go on Facebook, there is a support group for this topic as well and it is called Post Breast Therapy Pain Syndrome, I think we need to get all the support we can because no one else understands. This BCO  is a great site and I have gotten so much from it and I wished I would have know about it before I had my mastectomy. I am sorry that you lost your mother and also sorry about your sister. I do think things happen for a reason and so yes we have to stay strong and be there for others when we can.",

I joined about 6 months ago and there were only about 30 members and now there are 229, ladies from other countries also.  Enerva, I have also battled back and forth with bras. It seemed in early stages that a compression bra help. After going to a physical therapist I was able to stop wearing one I wear the coobie bra similar to the ahhahh bra but the band on the coobie is not as wide and the straps are thinner. I guess it depends on how much support you need. I am now going through a stage where I almost can't stand for anything to touch my chest or my upper back. I had first therapeutic massage Thursday so I am hoping this will help with some of my pain. It has been so frustrating having to deal with this horrible pain and trying to find the best treatment. ",
