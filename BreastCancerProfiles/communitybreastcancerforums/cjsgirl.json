Here is my (albeit short) history: Early February I had a normal yearly exam and the doctor was concerned about a lump on the right side of my rightÂ breast. At 35, I had never had a mammogram and she recommended I go ahead and have one. The mammogram definitely showed possible microcalcification and very dense breast tissue in one area. I then had an ultrasound, which led to the discovery of an additional lump UNDER my breast. One week later I had a needle aspiration on both--the first lump (right side of right breast) was diagnosed as a cyst. However, the lower lump was inconclusive and there was concern of blood in the extraction. The following week I had a stereotactic biopsy which was confirmed as Atypical Lobular Hyperplasia. A full excisional biopsy was performed 1.5 weeks later. It has been a month and the incision has healed nicely. I was scared of the initial ALH diagnosis, thinking that \"precancer\" would simply remain a black cloud hanging over me. But I found that I could move forward and stay positive, knowing I would keep an eye on it and have regular checkups. Unfortunately, for the last few days I've been experiencing pain under my left arm and on the left side of my left breast. I honestly thought this was due to sore muscles (recently started with a trainer at the gym and I've been SO sore). But last night I felt a small lump there. I called the doctor this morning and am having another mammogram today. I'm grateful they are quickly getting me in, but I am concerned about a few things: a) woudn't you think this should have been detected a month ago on the mammogram? They did BOTH breasts. Is it really possible for a lump to grow that quickly if it wasn't there a month ago? b) What are the odds this is simply a cyst or is it more likely to be ALH confirmed in BOTH breasts?? I know I need to just chill and wait on the mammogram results today...but I do not want to go through this all again. Yes, I am grateful I do not have a cancer diagnosis, but ALH is serious and if these lumps keep \"popping up\" then I am wondering how many biopsies will I need???!!! Should I get a second opinion? They have not yet referred me to a Breast Specialist--my doctor/hospital is part of Baylor and they do everything there. I am just confused and scared and a little suspicious I guess. By the way...no family history of breast cancer. Thanks for listening!! Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Diagnosis: 3/16/11 ALH of right breast (0) nodes Log in to post a reply",
