I was DX'd last Nov. 2010 with  breast cancer. I had a bilateral mastectomy on 12/3/10. I had 2 tumors removed from my right breast at 1.5cm.and 1.7 cm. I was Stage 3c with IDC, Grade 3, ISC high pos.,28 aux. LN were removed with 14 pos., ER and PR both low pos. I started chemo on 1/5/11. Taxotere, Carboplatin, Herceptin. It was to be every 3 weeks, but I was hit with too many side effects. I have glaucoma, and the taxotere and steroids  also affected my eye pressure. My Dr. decided to go every week after that and changed from Taxotere to Taxol as less harmful to my eyes. I just finished my course of treatment 5/15.  I meet with my oncologist tomorrow  to discuss radiation- daily for 5 weeks with 3 angles of my right underarm - tho with 28 gone I only have a few LN left. This is where I am stressing myself over after talking to my URO/GYN (had a 2 mo. intense bladder lining and urinary infection due to chemo. My oncologist gave me 2 weeks of Herceptin (no chemo) to give the 2nd round of antibiotics a chance to work.)  My URO/GYN had me get the book \"How Drs. Think\" as he has reservations on my radiation. Then my primary Dr. told me I should not do it. She said she's seen 3rd degree burns aggravated by the arm movement, and wet blisters that often lead to open wounds.I did more web research and found this possible with LN radiation . HELP!!! Has anyone had this type of LN radiation?? I would really appreciate any personal feedback. I read the HER2 book,  even got the movie,, and signed up on the Genetch Herceptin site, but finding more personal info on my big decision now is hard to come by.Thank you to anyone who responds! ",
