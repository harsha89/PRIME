      "Content": "HappyOwl wrote: I am new to this community, but my surgery was just over a year ago (bilateral mastectomy). Finished all treatments in December 2014. I still have regular itching/tingling near my scar areas and under my arm where lymph nodes were removed. I've tried benadryl and every type of lotion/cream/etc including prescription strength cortisone cream. One small under arm area is now red and almost feels like a small bump......which is most likely worse because I keep scratching and clawing at myself. I had silicone implants put in at the time of my mastectomy so I did not have tissue expanders. Parts of the scar area also itch and tingle almost non-stop. Has anyone else had experience like this?

Well meaning people expect that I should be perfectly fine and \"back to normal\" since everything is done, but in no way have I defined a \"new normal\" yet. Some days are better than others; being busy helps, but not a day goes back that I am not reminded about my cancer and the anxiety about recurrances. Intellectually, I believe I will be fine and I know there is new research being done every day, but emotionally it's another story. Thanks for the support everyone! ",
