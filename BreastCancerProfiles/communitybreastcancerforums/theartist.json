    "Content": "theartist wrote: At my last follow up visit visit to my rad onco, I was told that my lymphedema was gone!  I was dx with it after chemo and mx before starting rads for 7 weeks.  I was told it was \"mild to moderate\" in rt arm and hand, and did 6 weeks of PT.  I did my self massage twice daily and was told to wear sleeve and gauntlet 24/7 (except when sleeping) \"for the rest of my life\".  I am 46 and never fully believed this compression sleeve death sentence, and prayed for healing.  After wearing the sleeve and handpiece faithfully for over a year, it seemed to me that my hand would swell more while I had it on, so I would take it off for a bit, and the swelling seemed to go down.  I was also told to be careful of heavy lifting.  But my personal trainer husband convinced me to start lifting light weights when exercising.   I took the sleeve and gauntlet off for good in Oct '09.   I continue to do the massage, but haven't had to put the sleeve back on yet, except occasionally when lifting weights.  My doc measured me at last visit and said I was only 1 cm larger on affected arm, but that was pretty normal since it's my dominant hand.  Any thoughts and feedback would be appreciated.
