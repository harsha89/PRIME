I was recently hospitalized because of severe pain from progression. I had some radiation done on the back of the head so I could lay down without pain. Worked like a charm!! Now I have a, what I am calling \"lopsided unicorn horn\", \"devil horn\", growing out of my forehead near my hairline. Onc does not know what it is so hoping the upcoming scans will help figure out what it is!! Oh this cancertrain, please let me off!!!!!!!",

My treatment started with hormone therapy and I quickly went through 3 different kinds. I did a course of A/C treatment and the cancer progressed within 10 mths. I am lucky to still have my primary tumor, which has been biopsied again. My cancer has become endocrine resistant.I am starting paclitaxel next week. I feel lucky in some ways but also feel that I am going through treatments quickly. I guess I am hoping to know...I need to know, from all of you ladies, am I in a good spot? What are your opinions on my outlook, prognosis?! Any guidance would be much appreciated. I am driving myself crazy with googling and Docs always give the same answers,wait and see, but given the massive experience within this group, I was hoping for a little more! Thank you all in advance! Fight on lifers!!!
