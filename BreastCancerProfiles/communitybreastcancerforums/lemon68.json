I was also 43 at the time, adopted but have since been tested BRCA negative. 43 is not too young to get BC, there are women on the boards in their 20s-30s. HUGS to you, think it though. I decided after B9 results I wanted the calcifications out, and my BS was more than happy to do it, thank God. Hope you are one of the lucky ones.",

I felt confident this would end this horrible cycle. My end result is in my signature. But I am one of the LUCKY ones, 2 mm ILC thats so tiny, Stage 1. I was devastated but I know how lucky I am and going that extra step saved me from a worse DX later in life. I am also 44. Go with what your gut tells you to do, it is your body, only you can decide. Remember 90% find nothing else, if I could have been in the 90% i would have been celebrating. This has been a long, hard road but to not know is worse than knowing.

I am 44 my poor husband, its been very hard for him. They love us and never want to see us go through all this puts us though. All that is going through your mind is normal, I have had a hard time accepting this but as time as passed I KNOW I am going to be here to see my grandkids, I am not going to let this dang disease win. I have become very aggressive and a great advocate for ME. I have insisted on additional tests to help put my mind at ease. Has it helped? For about a minute.. wish I could tell you I am fine but I dont think we are ever completly fine again. All the what ifs are scary. You have proven you know your body better than anyone else. They should have done more for you as you were so pro active on your breast health. I wish I could help you and take away what you are feeling, breaks my heart to read your post because I know all of us here know the feeling you are in right now. Know that you have come to the right place. The women here have helped me so much. Read and educate yourself as much as possible. Share, cry, scream do whatever you need to do both in life and here. Its not fair and we were just giving a bad deal. Everyone says once you have all the facts and treatment plans you will feel better. I am not there yet, spend alot of time waiting..its sucks. Hang in there and know we are all here for you. Much love-lemon",

Following day I was up and around with no problems. It looked worse that it was. If you work outside the home I would take off a day or two at the most, everyone is different but I didnt find this to be as bad as I imagined.

He just said \"mama it will be okay, I will take care of you\" he is not strong but as he is taller than me and hugged me I knew he meant it and I did the right thing because I needed him. My other son is 13 and has no idea, he asked the other night if all the doctor stuff was over and if he should be worried. I told him I would let him know if he should worry. I was diagnosed on Friday late afternoon. This has forced me to hold it togethor as they were here and I wasnt going to let them see me fall apart and know. I had a meeting today with doc and was nervous and crying my son was here so I shared, the right time came and I knew. The right time will come for my younger son but I think I will know when. I hope that your visit here is short and that your news is better than were you mind is going. I feel for you I know how you feel.

As far as quality of life I don't understand anyone saying its better with a lumpectomy. Its what you choose for your body. No one else just YOU. It sounds like from your most recent post you have made your choice. I know when you do you feel it in your heart its the right one. All the best to you, I think you \"roll\" quite well and will be beautiful no matter your choice.",

Well, I did see the RO this morning and he said what I had was not the worst he had seen and if I didnt do it today I had to come back tomorrow. I didnt want to come back so I sucked it up and did it. Its not any worse now than yesterday. Its HOT and peeling, and the little blisters are up my underarm now. I took a tubesock of my DHs and ran it under cold water and put it under my boob. My boobs are pretty large (swollen too) and it holds it there perfectly. The only thing RO would give was the aquaphor ( does not help) and Smooth and Clear, it comes in a little packet, thicker than Aquaphor and a greasy mess. I like my all natural Aveeno, its soothes. I am miserable but know after the next few days I will start to heal. Chiefs Fan- I am with you, the itch is about enough to put my right over the edge. I am so sorry for you but I am right next to you feeling your itch and pain. I have new itchies places, my old itchies are now sore as the skin just flaked away, I see new pink skin in its place. Try Benedryl cream instead of the hydrocortisone, the hydro make me burn ( no pun intended) the Benedryl will not. ((HUGS)) I hope you get some relief.

I noticed yesterday my inner arm is now numb down to my elbow, very swollen and tingly. I am sure just one more SE of the rads. as I sit here now I have a cold tube sock wrapped around my boob so the underneath doesnt rub against skin. Its not skin to skin as there is no skin there.

If we could come up with some type of \"Boob Basket\" that is soft soothing and hydrating we would all be millionaires.

They were not willing to let it go. The RO said they dont have stats on only doing 15.  I think they felt I was already getting off easy.

I am on the table for 8 minutes. Dont feel a thing. Get some tanks or camis to wear. I wore a bra as long as I could, I then switched to a cotton Hanes sportsbra, now I am in a tank/cami which I hate but the band under the breast was rubbing me raw. Go to Walmart and get a few cheap ones as the creams/ointments is going to ruin them. I am doing 16 days, double dose each day.

Cancer Brain Fog What Causes It and What You Can Do About It by Pamela Joyce Shapiro, PhD  Cancer survivors face a number of physical, mental, and psychosocial challenges that diminish quality of life and alter one\u2019s sense of self. Brain changes that affect a person\u2019s cognitive identity \u2013 the thinking, capable, intelligent self \u2013 can be especially troubling. What is cancer brain fog? Following a cancer diagnosis, many survivors experience a sense of cognitive loss \u2013 the feeling that one\u2019s mental abilities are slower and less acute than before \u2013 as if the brain is in a fog. Problems with memory and concentration are the most common cognitive complaints, and some people report difficulties following directions, finding the right words, or performing simple calculations. Complex tasks, like planning or organizing activities, can be especially challenging for survivors with cognitive symptoms, and multitasking may seem impossible. Although cancer-related cognitive changes are sometimes called chemo brain or chemo fog, these terms are misleading. Symptoms of cognitive loss often occur before cancer treatment begins and can affect people who are treated with surgery, radiation, and hormonal therapy, as well as those who undergo a course of chemotherapy or immunotherapy. Many survivors experience a sense of cognitive loss, as if the brain is in a fog. http://copingmag.com/cwc/index.php/feature_article/cancer_brain_fog/ We are all in this togethor.",

My rads is whole breast, but I only had a 2mm ILC tumor, I did have DCIS and LCIS also. Just dont get why mine seems so strong for such a little tumor. I did not do chemo but I don't think that has anything to do with it. My underarm is very red and brown and extends to my back. I know we have breast tissue into our underarm. Does anyone know if the rads kills the lymphnodes in our axillary area? I imagine no or the breast would be able to repair itself from the rads.. making me wonder...",

The lymphedema is something I am watching for. I have seen some ask about deodorant during rads. I have not worn any for about 2 1/2 weeks on that side, I dont think I am sweating at all just have not needed it. I also was going to shave there tonight and realize there is no need.. if thats a perk I will take it! From my SNB incision down is smooth like a babys butt! Anyone else?",

I see the RO I am fairly sure I will not get my final zaps tomorrow. My skin has officially decided to open up underneath my breast, its painful as hell. And my nipple, aerola are peeling away revealing tender pink flesh. I also now have little tiny blisters in my underarm area extending to my back. Also shooting sharp pains, I assume these are nerves being irritated? Well they are irritating me now. Nice eh? Once again my gut feeling was wrong. I was not afraid of radiation, chemo yes but this no. I thought it would be easy. Its not easy and it sucks. I do not want to be insensitive to anyone that didnt get a choice to keep their breasts so dont get me wrong in some sick twisted way I do know how lucky I am. I do not feel lucky with this mound on my body tonight. Going to try to get the Tenderwets or mepilex as recommended here, thank you. Now dont let me scare anyone who is just starting or hasnt yet. We all react differently. I am olive skin and tan so there is proof that has nothing to do with it. I have sensitive skin and at times have hives and am prone to unexplained rashes. I just dont want anyone to feel any anxiety because I am having these issues. This too shall pass. HUGS to you all.",

I had no idea there even was a shingles shot. I hope you dont continue to cook for too long. My RO said 7-10 days and I just got worse as the days passed but then also healed as soon as the heating stopped. Hope the same for you, I remember a few weeks ago you were really getting miserable, hate to say it but I was at the same time and in someway it helped to know I wasnt alone. Take it easy on yourself and do things for you and rest if you need to. Sending healing thoughts to you, you have been though too much already. Amy, congrats on only 1 more time!! You have done so well, me and my tamoxifen are waiting for you so take your time!! please!! Riverflows- I have not worn deodorant since my SNB in January and havent needed to. Summer is coming so that may change. There was no way and still isnt I could apply anything as I had open wounds from rads. Good thing is I have baby soft skin coming in and no hair!

It calmed me down and did make me tired. I am not taking it regulary for that reason but if I get worked up in the evening I take a half and like others knowing it is there makes me feel better too. I like you am on here reading and looking things up constantly. I didnt know anything about this horrible disease and now I feel more confident in knowing what I need to ask and what I need to know. I think there may be a thread about fertility somewhere on this site if you do a search. You are too young, I feel too young at 44 but even if I was 54 or 64 I would still feel too young. Cancer sure isnt bias. Its not fair to any of us. I keep tracing my steps to what could have caused this but I dont think we will even figure it out. I do work with someone that had BC 12 yrs ago. She said it was the most horrific time in her life, just horrible but now 12 yrs later she thinks she was chosen so she could help others, and she thinks it was a blessing. I dont know if I will even feel that was bcuz now I feel sad, mad, unstable (LOL) and numb at times. I am grateful to have these boards to read about strength and bravery of these woman. Most I am sure never new they had it until they needed it, hope the same happens for me.",

She can speak for herself but I take exception to you both thinking something of her that is not so.  I know first hand its so hard. We all make choices and no one should judge us but sometimes others do lend advice, the boards are full of advice. Some we take some we don't, we all have enough to gripe about that is for sure without coming at each other. I do notice when I am told the 'right' way or 'wrong' way I sometimes feel a bit attacked but truly it is just another woman giving her advice in hopes to help.

But I had BRCA testing( took almost 3 weeks) done so that delayed the rads for me until 3/18. So for me time between Lumpectomy and rads was 3 months, seemed like forever. After SNB I was sent to a medical oncologist and radiation oncologist on 2/15. Has that been set up for you? I would image if your not having a SNB and your healed fully you would start fairly quickly. Hope this is helpful as far as timing.",

Thank you for sharing what happens after the rads are over, I had no idea I would keep cooking so to speak. I did know that on Friday I seemed okay and by yesterday afternoon I was a hot, burning mess. I dont even want to look at it today. This is real, although the past 5 months for me seems very surreal, like this just couldnt be happening. Thank you for reminding me that it isnt just going to go away after the last day of rads. I do know that I will walk away from this a different person that walking in. I will be forever changed but mostly for the better I hope.

Thank you for shining that light, I can see you down there waiting for me.. tears, there is nothing like someone that really understands... XO Co-ed room at my place too. It didnt bother me, so many have seen them I just stopped caring about it. We had little changing room with piles of gowns and blankets. I put a blanket over my shoulders at first mostly because it was so cold but after my zaps I didnt use it to walk back though. There was one man Ed, my buddy he has lymphoma and he kept his clothes on, I too would have felt a bit uncomfortable if he was pantsless. Can you ask for a blanket, I am sure they have them? Or put on 1 gown front ways and another backwards. I think they forget since its not them we do have our dignity. I also wore my work out pants. I had 2 techs girls and twice a week about a 30 yr old guy, that did make me uncomfortable I found myself joking alot with him, I am sure because I was uncomfortable.

April, Monday is your day, I know all your sisters here will be anxious to get your updates. I think you are going to be just fine since it is targeted in the area of your C and not whole breast. Did you get any statistics on doing this type vs whole breast? My MO had told me about a balloon device inserted for the 5 day, is that what you have? For some reason I keep thinking that was something they implanted and you didnt have to go daily. My grandfather had bladder cancer and was implanted with seeds, after he passed away they actually asked for them back! My mom doesnt think they ever got them. XO",

No bra yet but I keep trying. Lots of peeling happening, hoping when its over my new skin will be baby bottom soft. This is all tolerable compared so I am good. laurascott- I got my RX for tami too.. didnt pick it up yet. I wanted 30 days to do nothing, but honestly I am just not sure I go back and forth on taking it. Peg- I am a diet Pepsi drinker. I asked my MO on last visit and he said drink your diet pepsi. I know its not healthy but he said my diet pepsi did not cause my BC. I limit myself to 1-2 a day but I have never drank a cup of coffee and I enjoy it. I used to drink alot more. My MO says everything in moderation. I also asked about red meat same answer. He said the worst thing about the red meat isnt the hormones which I was concerned about he said the charring/burning from a grill is bad for everyone, interesting. I also asked about broccoli and it being a good food to fight cancer. He said I would have to eat a pick up truck of it daily to make a difference, again moderation.",

      "Content": "Apr 5, 2013 06:50PM lemon68 wrote: Look at this, some good news!! And April your test is in here too!! I put the GOOD news in bold and April your test is bold also. Thursday 6 December 2012 Cancer Research UK Press Release A lower total dose of radiotherapy, delivered in fewer, larger treatments, is as safe and effective at treating early breast cancer as the international standard dose, according to the 10-year follow-up results of a major Cancer Research UK trial presented at the 2012 CTRC-AACR San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium today (Thursday). Nearly 4,500 women across the UK have taken part in the START trials, which were co-ordinated by the Clinical Trials and Statistics Unit at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and funded by Cancer Research UK, the Medical Research Council and the Department of Health. The initial five-year results showed it was just as effective and safe to give women a lower total dose of radiotherapy in fewer, larger treatments than the 25-dose international standard. The new treatment routine also offered important benefits for women, including fewer trips to hospital, as well as cost savings for the health service. As a result, the shorter treatment course of 15 treatments was adopted in the UK in 2008, but the longer course is still used in many other countries. This latest 10-year follow-up, funded by Cancer Research UK, confirms these benefits and shows that very few women (around six per cent) experience a relapse of cancer within the same breast, regardless of whether or not they have a shorter course of radiotherapy after surgery. Chief investigator Professor John Yarnold, professor of clinical oncology at The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) and honorary consultant at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, said: \u201cWe have shown conclusively that less can be more in breast cancer radiotherapy. Three weeks of radiotherapy is as good as five weeks \u2013 as well as being more convenient and less tiring for patients and cheaper for the health service. \u201cThe risk of breast cancer recurring continues beyond five years, and side-effects of radiotherapy can often develop many years after treatment, so these long-term results provide a very important reassurance that the shorter treatment course is definitely the best option for patients. Some doctors may have been hesitant to change their practice on the basis of five-year results, but these long-term findings should convert those sceptics.\u201d The same team is now setting out to investigate whether even fewer doses of radiotherapy could be just as effective, as part of a new Phase III randomised controlled trial of 4,000 women called FAST-FORWARD. The trial will compare the new standard 15-dose course of radiotherapy treatment, delivered over three weeks, with an even shorter five-dose course, delivered over one week. Jo Haviland, a senior statistician at the ICR, added: \u201cThe START trial has had a huge impact on changing the standard of care for women with breast cancer in the UK, and increasingly around the world. Recruitment is already underway for the new FAST-FORWARD trial we are co-ordinating, to see if we can further improve treatment and spare both women and the health system the burden of extra treatments.\u201d Kate Law, Cancer Research UK\u2019s director of clinical research, said: \u201cWhat\u2019s really exciting is that, as a result of this trial, women are already benefiting from the added physical and emotional wellbeing of needing fewer hospital visits for their treatment. Minimising the long-term side effects of treatment is becoming increasingly important as cancer patients live longer. We hope that women around the world will now be able to benefit from this improved standard of care.\u201d",

I thought I might be going crazy as I could feel the heat and burn moving, he said I am not crazy it is now in the tail of the breast tissue under my arm and its exiting out my back. Has anyone heard this before? I cannot raise my arm as the burn now extends to my back and is raw. He said I am having a severe reaction and hopes within the next few days I feel some relief. They did wound treatment and it felt good. One thing is certain I will be scarred from this. My SNB scar and surrounding area is black and charred and it looks like I have other incision scars where the skin is ripping. I did have a seromona that was drained before I began rads. I am very swollen in that area, almost like rolls of baby fat. I am not going to get graphic about the actual breast but I dont recognize it as mine right now.Mentally I feel better today, I think I am getting used to hurting. I just wanted to say that days 1-14 I was pretty good. It wasnt until after #14 I almost overnight got bad, #15 was horrible and #16 put me right over the edge. I didnt want to do 15 or 16 but I felt forced to finish. Keep a close eye on things because for me during the TX was not bad, its after that I am suffering. I am sick of seeing myself post whining here, this is it for me on  this thread. I only post today in hopes I can help someone else. I am a regular poster on Team ILC Warriors, stop by its a great group with wonderful women and information. Thanks all of you and good luck to you with the rads. xo",

It may be nothing but at least you will have a baseline mammogram to go by for changes as you age. I started at age 30 and I was so happy to have those mammograms as it made it easier to track breast changes. BC usually does not hurt but on the boards you will see everyone is different and some had pain or tenderness. There are also many other reasons you could be having this awareness that have nothing to do with BC. Your doing the right thing, I hope everything comes out clear and you never have to come here again! But if you do you are not alone. All the best to you~",

I am at a stage I am glad I am at, I think I am just numb to the hurt and trying to accept. Everyone says the beginning is the worse time, I beleive them. As I get more information on this slow moving train I feel a bit better. A million questions and scenes go through my mind constantly but I try to base thoughts on facts not the unknowns.
