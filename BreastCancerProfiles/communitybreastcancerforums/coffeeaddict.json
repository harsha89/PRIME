Is it true that in order for women or men to be covered via state programs (referring to under or uninsured folks) such as Medicaid, that they have to be screened at said programs locations? What happens if you have a screening via a regular insurance (work or privately purchased)...they find something....and during that time the person loses health insurance coverage? Does that mean that the state won't cover them because the issue wasn't found in their screening process? Does that mean they now go for diagnostic screening via one of those programs? Curious - specifically for MN and WI. I am seeing conflicting info concerning MN - that you can apply for assistance if diagnosed elsewhere and other info that you need to be diagnosed via their screening. But, as mentioned above, what if that scenario happens? Does that mean you just don't get help and possibly die because someone else did the screening? Thank you for any information.
