The lump is about 3 cm and seems to sit atop another larger oblong lump. My breasts are very dense and I have lots of lumpy tissue, this one is hard and smooth and does not move. I am almost 48 and I've had and paid for the \"2nd mammogram\" many times so for the past four years I had blown off mammogram screening as part of my yearly GYN physical. Since I tossed the referral my doctor gave me in November, I had to call to get another one. She had me come in and she felt the lump also. No lymph node swelling and she did not feel it at Nov exam so maybe nothing...Mom bc at age 62, Maternal G.Mother spleen cancer age 79. Great Aunt BC all survivors. Scheduled for Mammogram + Ultrasound this Wednesday. My daughter graduates college in two weeks and I don't want to worry her so I'm posting where she wont see it. I will be praying with you for excellent news!",
