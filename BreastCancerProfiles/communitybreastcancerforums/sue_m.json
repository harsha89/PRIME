I wish I had known about this forum when I was first diagnosed because it is very intimidating to get your diagnosis and then have to start reading all this stuff. Especially when you are Stage III. Certainly at first, none of it sounds as though the word \u201cpositive\u201d could even belong on the same page, but as time goes on we get better at interpreting all these new facts and figures, and putting it all in perspective. This month is the 4th anniversary of when I discovered my lump so I identify with where you are today. Once treatment starts, life sort of moves along day by day and things seem less overwhelming. You\u2019ve come to the right place,",

On a CT scan that was done about 8 weeks after the mastectomy and prior to starting chemo, something showed up in the axilla, so the onc wanted to go after more nodes. I expected the lymph node procedure to be easier than the mastectomy since it was day surgery. It was easier. I kept a rolled up towel against my side to keep my arm from pressing on it and I had no pain to speak of. They gave me a prescription for Vicodin but I didn\u2019t need it. However, several days later I got an infection. Before the mastectomy, the surgeon had warned about the possibility of a seroma, but once the mastectomy was done I had pushed this out of my mind, so the whole infection thing came as a surprise. This kind of experience is the in the minority. Sometimes these things come up but we get through them. You\u2019re right\u2014it\u2019s one day at a time! I feel that it was 100% worth it to go after the extra nodes. Good luck,",

I was diagnosed IIA at first and then changed to IIIA a couple of months after my mastectomy, after closer examination and removal of more lymph nodes. From what I understand, the main purpose of staging is to help the doctors determine the treatment plan, but the extra effect is that it scares us. I think at the outset it is helpful to know what we\u2019re up against, i.e. how aggressive it is, and it gets less scary after a while as we get more familiar with all this stuff. (The education we didn\u2019t sign up for.) Reading the posts here helps a lot. Best,",
