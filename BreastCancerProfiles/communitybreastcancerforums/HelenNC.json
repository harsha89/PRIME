First, I asked my onc the same question about some not losing their hair with chemo. She said they had all tried another type chemo where patients did not lose it & then when the follow was done, their cure rate was not as high as it is for this type. So we'll lose our hair for sure. I start my first chemo treatment on Tuesday. As with any surgery you have, it's the anesthsia (spelling??) that takes long to get out of your system. It the reason you feel sluggish & sleepy. I think it's best to save your questions for your onc. I did. I also had a meeting with the chemo team, where I got most of my questions answered. Good Luck!",

After my first treatment, I was so darn sick w/bone pain & fatigue. As of today, I have no side effects except a mild heartburn. Has anyone had a delayed reaction like this? What is going on with me? I don't want to seem ungrateful, but how can I not be feeling the SE's? My onc told me to switch to tylenol for the bone pain & apparently it's working. Anyone else ever have a good week after chemo?",

Then in 2 wks when my hair starts falling out, I'll come back in & she'll shave it. Well, she made me short all right. It has no style at all & is mostly shaved with spikes on top! It looks awful! Now I have to wear a wig or hat to my first chemo treatment!",

Koman also supplies a free wig. They said to give them my closet wig salon & they called them, gave them a dollar amount & I came home with a beautiful wig.  Another foundation, crickettsanswerforcancer.org is a wonderful organization started by a mother who lost her grown daughter to BC. She has offered my 3 websites to visit to choose a wig. I choose Paula Young Wigs. They have a special right now...buy one get one free on certain wigs. So I am getting 2 free wigs for the price of one....for free!  Also franceluxe.com will donate a beautiful headcovering for cancer patients. They sent mine & it's beautiful. And heavenlyhats.com",
