I know you have been in expanders for nearly an eon just like me.  And I know you are a super athelete who does mountain climbing and cycle spinning and probably bungy jumping and parachuting for all I know.  So, I know you just could not keep yourself from taking a nice, big stretch when there are still stitches healing in there.  Anne. I think you just need to do what you tell everyone else whose ever had surgery, TAKE IT EASY FOR THE FIRST FEW WEEKS!  Unless you feel a real electric zing with this pain, then I'd be more inclined to think this is a very aggravated stitch area that needs to be left alone.  Stopping the cycle of pain is correct as I know you know.  So, if it is nerve pain, stopping that cycle with a drug meant to stop it is what you need.  And do no more stretching until you are healed.  You girls who have all this amazing physical ability really need to be kept in check don't you?!  Now take it easy, take something to stop the cycle of pain and do nothing for about a month and whatever else you would tell any other patient to do!  It's a good thing I'm not some marathoner type or I'd probably have done the same thing because I am getting impatient with all this too. OK, that's all for the lecture.  Now, I want to say I hope you start feeling better real soon and congratulations on being out of expanders! Hanna",

Ah, but there is a great difference in the tech who gets certified in a 6 week program versus the well educated and experienced BSRN.  The strange thing is how so many people keep referring to them all as \"nurse\".  There are techs, CNAs, practical nurses, 2 year nurse RN's with years of experience, 4/5 year BSRN program grads, Nurse Practitioners, and Nurses with doctorates!  Yet, when someone calls out \"nurse!\" people often think they are getting someone with years of experience, training and education under the belt when in fact, they may have just gotten a certificate in 6 weeks.  We can never be sure.  The 6 week certificate people may actually be great - if they have a natural gift or much experience.  It's all in their ability and the woman you essentially 'dismissed' from your care needed to learn she must contain her ego and learn from people who have mastered the techniques required for the position.  Having kids taught me not to be intimidated by a person wearing scrubs, latex gloves and holding a loaded syringe!  If I'm not feeling good about a person's technique - I call a halt to it and get up and go.  Just a few days ago, I had to remove my son from an inept phlebotomist.  I just said I was taking him because I love him and respect him.  Done.  They looked at me like they had never heard THAT one before!! LOL.  So yes, you did the right thing for you, for her and for any other people that may come along before she has tempered her ego and begun to learn from those who practice these procedures with skill. You did the right thing and just stop feeling shakey about it!  I know you never want to hurt anyone's feelings, but this woman is not blessed with your sense of caring!  You are feeling like you hurt her feelings, but I can assure you - you did not!  Hopefully, she will have an ephiphany and realize she needs to observe and take guidance from those who can help her learn before she damages another person in her care.  Just speak privately with your usual more experienced nurse about that other one and say you really do not want that other one performing procedures on you and would rather a more experienced person provide your care at this time. OK? <3 Hanna ",

Your tongue is getting better.  You began with the sore throat after the T/A tx.  I believe your sore throat is a by-product of the tx to kill off the bad cells and the soft tissues are being affected by it.  I would bet your doctor is sending you for a throat check just because.  Has your onco prescribed any pain meds to help along with something to keep constipation away?  You need some pain meds to help you through and I still think benedryl might be helpful to you because you said they have to infuse you so slowly. Why not try a good dose of benedryl and a pain meds, anti-anxiety meds, anti-constipation stuff, and have some Italian Ice to numb your throat sores. Since your tongue is getting better, I bet your throat will too. I'm sorry your having all this crap to deal with.  I'm beginning to think everyone should go to Watson's onco for the Antonio Banderas extra special tx.",

Bone scans should pick something up if there was something, in fact they even pick up arthritis.  I'm no doctor, but having talked to lots of doctors, I would think you don't have bone mets. Don't worry, getting the night fears is so normal and so unwanted.  Take care and sleep well. Tell those fears to get lost.    ",

I laid on my stomach for this but some people curl on their side.   The doctor numbed the spot and I didn't feel anything. They numb you up first!  The thought of a spinal tap scared me BUT getting the spinal tap DID NOT hurt!  So don't worry OK?  You will get a little novocaine to numb you first and that is like a finger stick.  Your back is less sensitive than you think it would be for novocaine shots. Now, you MUST LAY FLAT for a good while afterward because you can get a headache if you sit up too soon. So lay down.   Your doctors and nurses will tell you how soon to sit up.  I was told to lay down for 24 hours.  The people who get up too soon are the ones who get a headache.  So do as your doctors and nurses tell you OK Deb from Kentucky?  Good luck sweetie!  You will do fine!

      "Content": "Feb 26, 2008 02:17AM - edited Feb 26, 2008 02:29AM by Hanna Dear Mom2acat, Tender is so right about this.  Gallstones can get stuck in a tube that empties into the small intestine I believe. I'm not sure but I think other tubes can also be blocked by gallstones too.  If one got stuck in there - the pain is just awful and does radiate around to your back from the upper right quadrant of your abdomen.  Gallstones and gallbladder trouble can cause problems in the general epigastric region too which is right there in the upper middle of your tummy right below the middle of your ribs. I've had a stone stuck in a tube before and it was very, very painful.  An ultrasound - just like Tender spoke of - can reveal gallstones too.  Now, you could also have sludge that creates symptoms too.   The liquid diet is good for now, and not eating any fatty foods at all.  When I had a stone stuck in a small tube, I was told to heat filtered water and add a bit of lemon juice to drink.  Also, decaffinated green tea.  Low sodium beef broth didn't bother me either.  Sipping on filtered water through the day too.  I also had to take the pain meds I never needed for post surgery to get me through the gallbladder inflammation.  I never realized just how painful things such as kidney stones and gallstones could be. The stone eventually left the tube because with the no-fat, no fowl or chicken broth, no ice cream diet - just the decaf tea, warm water w/lemon juice and beef broth, and mashed potatoes made with water only helped me through.  Tender, do you know if sludge would also be visible on an ultrasound, or is it just the stones? The ultrasound is quite good at revealing these gallstones, but I'm not positive about sludge which can also cause gallbladder trouble. Do you know? Feel better soon Mom2acat!   I needed to edit here because Tender did say ultrasound could pick up on sludge - which under the circumstances is good to know.  ",

This may not be relevant to what's wigging you out, but I was a little wigged out too when I was told after surgery that the Alloderm they put in me was donated human tissue.  I didn't know this ahead of time. Cadaver skin!  I started thinking about the person who this skin came from.  I wondered if it was a man or a woman (I now believe it was from a man because since it was put in I hate to cook, grocery shop and despise doing dishes and have gone carryout).  Anyhow, I have honestly grown to appreciate that my Alloderm person was an organ donor - otherwise I'm sure an implant would fall through my skin and land on the floor without it.  I never could donate blood because my blood pressure was always below some range it needed to be - but lots of my family members do and they are really nice, healthy people.  I'm positive they scrutinize blood donors these days.  The days when any drug addict who needed $25 donating blood are long gone.  I feel it's safe now but it's just my opinion.  Hanna ",

From where I sit, I see the written word has taken off like gangbusters again.  It is a renewal of the appreciation of words written.  Add to that the fact in a forum like this, we can reach out as far as we want, keep as much to ourselves as we need to, share as much of ourselves as we want to - and voila - a place for us to be.  I've seen there are some who eventually do trickle away for one reason or another.  Then there are those who have lost their lives to this disease.  Having joined only since December, I did not have the opportunity to communicate with some of them.  But in this short time, there were some who I did write to and their loss has caused me to grieve.  This forum has made me think of the Pony Express.  People would wait eagerly for written communication from their family, friends, and loved ones when out in the midwest with no telephones.  They waited for news.  I think how hard those ponies ran across our country to deliver letters and messages from one place to another.  I think how sore the riders must have gotten.  All because the written word - passed from one person to another - does matter. I think \"unsubscribing\" is such a cool way of putting a spin on this.  We can feel almost addicted to this forum!  How is so and so.  What is new on the boards.  Reading the humor of some women.  Sympathizing about the trials of another. Sharing support for others who have called out through cyberspace for advice or just to share their day.  It can be a little frustrating to know you are not doing some things you'd hope you would get done because you were here communicating on this forum.  I have.  Oh, I won't go into everything else I could have gotten done while reading up here, but believe me, I do think I need to turn my head away and \"get things done\" on a more frequent basis.   I've come to the conclusion that you are right - BC.org IS like the Hotel California.   What an astute observation!  You check in, make friendships - then it is your choice whether to move away, or stay, or come and go.   I think of myself as an undone project right now and expect to stick around longer.  Plus, I just have come to care about the girls here.  I don't think I'll make a conscious decision to leave here and never return.  More likely, I could see myself just posting less frequently.  Gradually letting go of the astral cord of connection.  But, I do think I will always keep my account.  Could this be seen as an addiction?   Possibly, but if so - it's not one that needs rehab!

Take care, Hanna  ",
