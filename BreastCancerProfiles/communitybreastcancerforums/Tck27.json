He has two one inch spots in his bones and a few small (millimeter) spots in his lungs. He has two cysts on his liver (they think they are cysts) and a cyst on his scrotum which, he will be seeing a neurologist for. The cancer isn't aggressive and is slow moving. What concerns me is that the doctor told him \"you're not going anywhere right now, you will be here for at least a year\" That's not super encouraging. Any advice?",

He went in a few weeks ago to get it checked out and biopsied. Turned out both the lump and first receiving lymph node tested positive for cancer cells. He was supposed to go in for a mastectomy and twenty lymph node removals but, the MRI CT SCAN showed two spots in his bones and apparently what they think are two cysts in his liver. We have no family history. I was diagnosed with stage 1b melanoma last year. Because of this they stressed genetic testing. Anyways, his cells tested estrogen positive along with progesterone. So, it was a highly hormonally induced cause. Instead of the surgery, he will begin hormonal therapy soon. In addition, he will receive more blood tests to figure out how aggressive it is. How did hormonal therapy work for y\u2019all? How long does he have? All I can find are statistics regarding 5 year survival but, nothing more. They plan to use the tumor on his left breast as a marker to measure the effectiveness of the therapy. Do you suggest he have the cysts removed? Thank you so much! God bless y\u2019all Log in to post a reply",

His markers showed a slight increase but, they're going to give the hormone therapy another two weeks. If it doesn't work, he will be doing a low grade chemo aparrently. In addition, he's in a very stressful home life. My mom isn't the nicest so, I'm worried that will affect his fight also. I'm hoping that the hormonal treatment proves to be successful. Do yall have any suggestions or advice? How long do I have left with my father? I'm terrified to lose him. Thank you!",

She has a lot of issues and he doesn't think leaving her at this time would be good for him mentally. I live out of state at the moment and the soonest I can return is next fall. So, I'm doing my best to see him every other month or so if Ican.  Are you familiar with any alternative, endocrine, or clinical treatments?",

My dad just had it done. They are concerned we may be BRCA positive due to my diagnosis of Melanoma because, Melanoma is linked to BRCA. As far as my genetic composition is concerned, I have no idea yet what will come about my genetic tests. My dad hasn't received his genetic results yet so, we do not know if he is BRCA positive. We have no family history of BC so, the BRCA gene came out of nowhere if we do indeed have it.  Thank you for your reply",

He did say how the tone of voice from his doctors seemed different from when they originally thought he had stage 2 or 3 BC. He is aware that it is not a curable disease but, they've told him it can definitely be treatable and manageable. His doctor shared how his mother lived for 25 years after her diagnosis. He also has a cyst on his scrotum apparently. So, I know he's concerned about that also.  He returns do his onc on Wednesday and I'll be sure to keep ya'll updated. Thank you so much! Sidenote: I am 26 years old and they found a lump in my left breast last year. I went in for an ultrasound by a breast surgeon this January and was told all was normal. It's gotten slightly bigger since then. Any advice? I am awaiting to hear news regarding my father's genetic testing. Melanoma is linked to the BRCA gene and I was diagnosed with that in 2017. 1.5 years cancer free thus far! ",
