On March 17, at age 40, I was diagnosed with ILC (Stage 1a, grade ii) in my left breast, inner quadrant. 6 months prior to that, LCIS in my left breast, outer quadrant. 1 month prior to that, 2 pulmonary embolisms in my left lung (no causal factors). I had an MRI after the ILC dx, but nothing further has been done. The MRI did show another suspicious mass in the 12 o'clock region that is about 5mm. The surgeon said we could biopsy it, do a lumpectomy on the other mass and possibly this one depending on what they found. She also said if it were her, she'd have a mastectomy - of both - because with LCIS it's common to have it show up in the other breast eventually. And LCIS will - usually later than sooner - become ILC. So I opted to have the mastectomy/reconstruction so I wouldn't have the fear/anxiety of \"what now?\" with each mammogram/ultrasound/MRI I get. So now we are 2 weeks out. Of course I'm nervous, scared, angry, anxious, etc. When the mastectomy is performed, they will also remove lymph nodes and test those as well. So while I'm at a stage 1a now, that could all change. Right now, I won't have to have any radiation or chemo, but again...the surgery could change all of that. People keep asking how I'm feeling/doing, to which I say fine. Not much gets to me (my husband jokes that I'm a \"type z\") and I usually just roll with whatever comes at me. In a way though, I feel guilty for not feeling the way people think I should be feeling. I hope that makes sense. It still feels odd to say \"I have breast cancer\", but through it all, nothing I've been told actually surprised me. It still doesn't feel \"real\" though.

I had my preop with the plastic surgeon, and have been on the verge of tears all day since. I don't think the cancer itself, or the surgeries are what has me down. I'm a go getter - and do not ask for help unless it's absolutely necessary. My husband travels for work and has since our now 13 year old was 2. It's my norm. I do everything to maintain and run our family. Being out of commission for several weeks doesn't sit well with me. I know I have to take it easy, but I also know my personality...and once I'm home from the hospital, I'm going to struggle to rest. I'm sure I won't have my normal energy level at first, but I don't know if I can be \"still\" for 3-4 weeks as being suggested to me. My clue that today wasn't going well....when I started to tear up because my starbucks app wasn't working for 1/2 price frappacino day! :0",

My OBGYN said something after I had the clots and beforehand sent me for my baseline mammogram. He said \"we known for some cancers that can cause blood clots, but we don't know of all the cancers that can cause blood clots.\" That has stuck with me through all of this. I came off the Xarelto in February. I know I'm making the right decision but sometimes it feels extreme. Especially when I tell someone I have stage 1 bc and I'm having a DMX. I've gotten several, \"stage 1? Really? And you're having a DMX?\" From what I know, chemo isn't much of an option with ILC and we don't know if it's in my nodes yet. I can do rads, but there are no guarantees. My cancer is ER+/PR+ but tamoxifen isn't an option because of my history of blood clots. So where does that really leave me? I guess at times I feel like I'm jumping the gun. But at the same time, from what I had learned when the LCIS was found in my left breast last Fall, it was never a matter of \"if\" I would get cancer, but \"when\". I think the \"when\" just came a lot sooner than anyone expected. And if I remember correctly LCIS is also more likely to develop bilaterally. So while my right one seems to be behaving now, I don't want anything to rear its ugly head later",

I had my preop with my BS today, and she was able to answer a lot of my questions. One thing I've been concerned about is them finding cancer in my lymph nodes. She said they would know that before I come out of surgery. That put me at ease knowing I won't have to wait a week or more for those results. I honestly feel like I'm about to have a baby...not literally, but all the preparation. Having my hospital bag ready to go, my house clean, my laundry done, people lined up to bring food and take care of my kids...yep, pretty much everything I did when I had my 2 girls. It's totally crazy.",
