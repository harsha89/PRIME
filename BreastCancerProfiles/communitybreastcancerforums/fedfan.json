I have just finished my 2nd round of Taxol. I have also had a Neulasta shot 24 hours after each treatment. I too have had ringing ear problems, although I have described it as crickets...like the sound around dusk in the trees on a summer evening. Sometimes I can't tell if it's the crickets or in my head. I figured this was a side effect of the chemo. My brother-in-law who is a neurologist said that the chemo could have that kind of effect. I never thought about the Neulasta shot as being the cause. Whatever is causing it, I am looking forward to it being gone when I finish chemo in June. Â ",
