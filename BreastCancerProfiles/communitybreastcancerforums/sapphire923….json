My BMX with free TRAM reconstruction is scheduled for July 15th.  Had all pre-op testing 2 days ago and met with PS today for photo shots. Waiting seem to be the hardest part since the diagnosis. Although I don't feel any different (no pain, lump etc.) than before the diagnosis just the word cancer has scared me and I have been sitting here wondering where is it spreading now. I don't know what to expect but I am determined to get my life back after the surgery and get back to work.  I hope everything goes ok on the 15th and I will be able to get back to normal.  Thanks again for all your support.  Wish the best to all of you ladies out there.  Geetha (sapphire923)",

BMX with Tram flap recon took 15 hours because the veins were too congested and took too much time to connect them.Today is the fourth day and I am already walking. Feeling good so far and may be going home tomorrow. Acording to the BS the frozen SNB was negative but they still want to wait for path report. I stopped taking morphine Friday afternoon and no pain meds needed after day 3 (just 1 oxicodene at night) have been spending most of the hours in the recliner and nights in the bed.All the 6 drains are still there. Hope atleast some of these will come out if I come home tomorrow. Hope all who went before me are doing ok and good luck and speedy recovery to all the ladies out there. Thanks a lot for your support.  Geetha (sapphire923)",

My BMX with Tram Flap recon on the 15th feels like a dream, the whole thing was a piece of cake and not as bad as I expected it to be.  I had a wonderful group of doctors and nurses. After the surgery I was kept in so called \"step down unit\" which is one level lower than ICU so they can keep an eye on the blood flow,temperature etc on the new breast since they did the micro surgery to connect all the blood vessels to the new flap. Came home on the 20th with 6 drains which was really painful and hanging all over. All drains were removed when I went to the followup appointment last Friday (23rd). I expected the worst of pain after the 15 hour surgery but it has been a breeze.  No pain in my abdomen just one big scar end to end. Breasts are very sore and tight. Under arm where the SNB was done is very sore.  I was not able to shower for 10 days and was tough getting through hot days of summer stinking all over. Finally took shower on Saturday.  I still have the compression garment on the stomach and soft front velcro bra. Most of my pain and discomfort is under my arm where the SNB was done and tightness and pulling and tugging in the new breasts. My range of motion is about 75%. Becomes very sore across the chest/breast and tight when I use my hand a lot (like typing on the computer). Right breast looks and feels good. The left looks good but has couple of hard areas, mostly on the side going towards the under arm.  Hope it is not a problem. I will know more tomorrow when I see the PS.  After the tram flap the stomach is pretty flat and looks good. Haven't started driving yet.  youngmomof3: We both had exact same surgery. How many drains did you have? My body looks good.  Breasts look bigger than before, may be there is still some swelling. I like the way my body looks now, with flat stomach and all. Hope you are doing well.  Best wishes for a speedy recovery. Ducki: Hope your drains are out and feeling better. My drains were painful and very uncomfortable. I am glad they are finally out. Orchidgal: I am glad you are on this side now.  Sounds like you had the same good experience I had. Hope you are feeling better. Hope everyone is recovering and feeling better.  My best wishes and prayers to all. Thanks again for all your support and to Orchidgal for moderating this little forum of ours.  Geetha (Sapphire923). ",

Orchidgal:  I am glad you have frineds and neighbours to help you.  I am alone too.  I lost my husband to cancer 13 years ago.  My daughters and good friends will be helping me out for the first couple of weeks.  Since the DX it has been crazy being alone at home and going to work and trying to keep a straight face and get the work done.  Thank you for starting the July MX forum.  I feel like I have gained whole lot of friends/sisters and talking to all of you seem to help. Please do let us know how you are doing.",

      "Content": "Jul 4, 2010 08:20PM - edited Jul 4, 2010 08:27PM by sapphire923 Scrablelady, Shawn(rosesrx), Thankyou for your feedback and support. Scrablelady: My BS said not to worry and it wouldn't make a difference whether she did the surgery today or 6 months from now. Easy for her to say.  Evevry little lump I feel or every little pull or tightness in the breast scares me.  I am like you, like to get all the information possible. 11 more days to go for the surgery.  Goodluck on the 8th.  Wish you a fast and easy recovery. Shawn:Biopsy on my right nodes came out negative, thank God.  I decided to go with the recon immediately because I don't want to deal with the pain and missery twice. I am looking forward to waking up with two new girls and hopefully a nice tummy tuck.  I am hoping they won't find cancer anywhere else when they go in. Is any of the July ladies getting the SNB shots?  From what I have read in this forum sounds like just the shots are very painful.  I have to get the SNB shots on the 14th, the day before my surgery.  Hope it is it not as bad as everyone says. My prayers are with all the July ladies for a fast and easy recovery.",
