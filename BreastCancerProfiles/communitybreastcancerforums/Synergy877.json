    "Content": "Synergy877 wrote: Back in December, I found a lump approximately the size of a BB.  I waited a couple of cycles and finally went to the doc in February.  We also noticed an enlarged lymph node right beside my breast.  I had a digital mammogram and ultrasound at the hospital (a week later), and the radiologist immediatly came back with the good news that it was simply a cyst.  Is it normal for the cyst to still remain 7 months later (along with the enlarged lymph node) or should I request some type of biopsy?  I'm 37 years old with no family history of cancer.  The doctor said that between that and the test results, I have nothing to worry about.
