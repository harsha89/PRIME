But, then in these families you tend to have other issues too, be it heart issues, senility, etc. My husband's family members just seem to die of old age, but maybe given how much dysfunction and drama is in that family (we live far away) their trade-off is a lot of stressful years?  Have you ever thought about testing? Even your brother's melanoma and grandfather's pancreatic cancer can be signs of a mutation.  Anyway, I wanted to comment as you talked about how your OB/GYN thought a MX was a \"bit drastic\"....as I despise when people say that. I have only had a couple people say this to me and I look at them like they have three heads, because of COURSE it is \"drastic\". It is a surgical procedure that amputates what are (hopefully) healthy breasts to reduce risk. It is like they think that I have not considered the surgery thoroughly or just think of it as a minor nip & tuck. Ha, if only they knew! I did not really get into it with either of those that said this, as they are more the type who believe that disease can be prevented and cured by tinctures and mushrooms (and seem to forget that I am a very healthy, active person overall...just like my mother, grandmother, etc), and because well, honestly I do have a lot of support from family, friends, and my medical providers, so a few naysayers who do not have the same experiences or family history I do are not a big deal. Also, my impression is they aren't really that interested to hear my experience anyway...they have already made their judgment.",

There are other potential genetic mutations, some known, and some not. There are also families like mine where the reason is NOT known (we are BRCA-), and it may be the result of a combination of genetic variants/polygenic factors, but it is clear there is a hereditary pattern. It can be a little frustrating to not have a clear answer as to WHAT the issue is in my family, and I tried searching for a while, but I have accepted the uncertainty of it and that we may never know...or maybe one day we will. I have my suspicions. But either way, I can only go with what I do know now. I know I have been assessed with a 40% risk from 3 seperate genetics experts. I know that in my family the breast cancer hits in a woman's 40s. I know in my family the cancers are sneaky and aggressive. And deadly. I know that while I am a risk taker in some things, I am NOT a risk taker when it comes to the breast cancer that strikes my family. I know that screening to \"catch it early\" failed my mother and grandmother. I know that an awareness of my risk has impacted my life and life decisions ALL through my life. I know that screening causes me anxiety. I know that I cannot do that high risk screening for, oh, 40-50 (3-4 different screenings a year!) years or until I am too sick and old for surgery anyway. I know that a PBMX does not remove all risk, but I know it removes enough risk to bring me some peace that I did all I could and won't have what ifs. I know that I am booked for a PBMX on April 24th, 2014 and my family, friends, and medical providers are overwhelmingly supportive. Even if I don't know WHAT genetics are at play, I know in my family there is a genetic risk...or we are INCREDIBLY unfortunate to have such a terrible number of sporadic cancers (or to always be in the 1 in the 1 in 8!). I can remember being in various public places...the gym, the supermarket line, and thinking....there are 20 women around me. On average, a little over 2 of us would get breast cancer (I know not necessarily 2 in THAT line, but I am playing averages here!) and I always thought right away...\"I wonder who the second woman in this line would be?\" as I ALWAYS felt I was one of them. That plays with your head over the years! I can't tell you what is right for you. Everyone has their own risk comfort, and there are different clinical guidelines (for example, I know some surgeons won't consider 25% assessed risk as \"high risk\", here where I am the guidelines do say 25% is high risk BUT a PBMX is more on a case-by-case basis, not \"automatically\" recommended as it might be for a higher risk). Anyway, I agree with LRD...your mom's doctor is wrong to speak in absolutes. It is very likely he is making sweeping generalizations based on assumptions or rather superficial genetics knowledge, but he certainly does not sound like a genetics expert!",

I know my own breast and plastic surgeons were surprised how informed I was (they appreciated my \"realistic goals\", ha) but they did still seek to discuss the risks of infection, necrosis, loss of implant, that I would lose sensation, and so on to ensure I really understood what I was choosing to do and what risks came with that choice. It still surprises me how many women don't seem to realize that a mastectomy means the loss of sensation (and for many who derive it from breast stimulation, a bit part of their sexual pleasure). So, there is a lack of information there from the doctors, but also a lack of self-guided research.  I am a bit of a natural Negative Nelly though...I tend to have this curiousity that drives me to research all the potential negatives as well as positives of anything I do...you should have seen me when I took up scuba diving and was reading all sorts of dive accident analysis reports and telling my husband about all the ways things can go horribly wrong underwater for us both...but for me this actually helps me feel more prepared when things do go wrong. I looove diving and was not discouraged at all by that knowledge. It just made me aware and cautious. But, I know not everyone is like that and some people do need to focus almost only on the positive to jump in the water, or on the surgery table, or wherever else. Many of the women here on these forums in particular are dealing with a diagnosis and I can't put myself in their shoes so rarely comment on those with a cancer diagnosis making the choice, though I do feel an uncomfortable twinge when I see someone with an invasive cancer say that they are going to get an MX to prevent mets or something...because if that is the purpose, well I fear they are not properly informed and may be trading in something they would not if they were better informed. I step out a little more when it is someone without a diagnosis, though. I do feel quite horrified when I see someone look at getting a PBMX when everything seems to indicate they are at rather average risk, and think of it as a straightforward surgery, with the bonus of perkier boobs or a tummy tuck, or whatever else! I feel just on edge when someone IS high risk but thinks that a PBMX guarantees them a future without fear of breast cancer...it is surprising how much I see that actually.  PBMX can be the right choice for some, but it does have its limitations and definitely has its risks. I agree the AJ effect was around long before AJ made her decision public.",

My mother had her MX/PMX during treatment in her late 40s..8 years ago... and had (has) a hard time with it...she never pursued PBMX and even now is not sure she would choose differently. Her boobs do not \"define\" her but their loss was still hard for her. There are physical and sexual losses, ongoing pain issues, a sense they are not \"hers\" (despite being her own tissue), change to what she knew as her body. My breasts certainly do not define me either (yikes, I should hope no woman chalks who she is up to her breasts!) but they ARE a part of me, so I can understand that it might not be a the path taken for women of all ages. I do not like idea that women choose not to do this as their breasts \"define\" them...that is simplistic and I don't really think that IS the case for most if not all. As for partners...my husband is incredibly supportive. He gets a bit teary thinking about me going through all that, though has been beside me since Day One and always willing to listen and ask questions.

Later did testing via a research program where I was found to have a few variants/single nucleotide polymophisms (SNPs) that have been \"linked\" to higher breast cancer risk and may work in a cumulative way but there is still little known about their impact and no clincal guidelines, so I continue on as \"uninformed\" . ",

Masses that appear irregular, ill-defined, or random shaped, are usually highly suspicious for malignancy, which would explain why you were assigned a BIRAD 5 by the radiologist. This does not mean for certain your mass IS malignant, but the chance is higher. The size is well, just the size. Both benign and malignant conditions can come in all sizes, though generally speaking a smaller malignancy increases chances there is no node involvement and you are at an earlier stage at diagnosis. Here is a good summary of mass, shape, etc on mammography findings and how the characteristics may lead a radiologist to suspect it being likely benign, or suspicious for malignancy: http://www.breast-cancer.ca/screening/mammographic-mass-characteristics.htm",

The deletion is a moderate-penetrance gene that increases lifetime risk 2-3x (to lifetime risk of 20-30%) in certain populations (Northern and Eastern European). In this group, those who carry the mutation and actually also have a family history of breast cancer have a lifetime closer to 37% so obviously how it has affected your own family is important. OP, you are correct it is quite rare in the general population, but it is good you are getting tested against your mom's results, as if you do carry it then especially given your mother's cancer you are at higher risk.

I had one nurse practitioner tell me once, when I was in my early 20s, my breasts were \"the most granular\" she had ever felt. I hoped at time her sample amount was small as I was like, uh, what does that mean!? Another surgeon later on told me mine were \"very lumpy\". I had larger, discernible, and more tender lumps show up a few times over my 20s and early 30s.  It is not common to remove benign lumps unless they are causing a lot of pain and discomfort. I am surprised your surgeon said they like to just remove them. I would have been in surgery several times before I hit 30! Surgeries cause, for one, scarring that can make imaging difficult later. Second, it can cause cosmetic deformities. I never had any of my lumps removed. When I had my surgery, all my pathology was benign....definitely many hormonal/fibrocystic changes but all benign. Breast cancer at your age is not common, the average risk of breast cancer in your 20s is less than 1%. Many of those who do get it have genetic risks, and so on, but not everyone does.  Benign changes do explain most lumps that women your age get. So, it is not unusual your medical providers are operating on that assumption.  That being said, it is clearly not impossible. I know how horrible it feels to have your concerns dismissed outright due to age. I have a strong family history of pre-menopausal breast cancer and had that happen more than once. I think it's good you are going to try to go to a breast centre for another opinion. They can either confirm your current recommendations or recommend another one, like a biopsy or follow-up. Even if benign, they can provide education on what you can expect with fibrocystic breasts. ",

Yes, there are stages where it is more likely to treat it effectively with more simple treatment, and one can live the rest of her life without a recurrence, but even those with early stage cancers can end up with chemo, surgical complications, radiation complications, mets, not to mention side effects, emotional impact, and so on. Certainly, if I *were* to be diagnosed I would prefer it be in early stages versus late stages/mets, but I would be luckiest if I did not get cancer at all. And, as SpecialK noted, Angelina does not have cancer. She is BRCA1+, so she had her PBMX and will be having her ooph as risk-reduction surgeries. WIthout them, she is at very high risk of both cancers (up to 87% for breast, something like 60+% for ovarian, depending on the mutation and her family history). Neither reduce her risk of breast or ovarian cancer 100% though, she still remains at a risk that can be higher than many in the \"average population\" as it is impossible to remove all possible tissues, and she also remains at higher risk of certain other cancers, such as peritoneal cancer which has very high mortality. Her mother died of ovarian, her aunt last year of breast cancer. Apparently both BRCA1 & 2 run in her family, which also means some family members are at higher risk of other cancers, like pancreatic... which has dismal survival times. Do you understand that people like Angelina Jolie who make those choices are VERY aware of what cancer..and cancer treatments... can do (often to many family members) and are trying to prevent that from happening to themselves or their families? I have seen what it did to my mother (at 48 a Stage III dx (6+cm, 19+ nodes) had a very difficult surgery and recovery, chemo, radiation, and now going on 7-8 years of chemoprevention...and we wait and hope everyday it is enough to hold a recurrence back...annual mammograms NEVER saw it), my grandmother (two primaries - one in her 40s, one in her early 50s, died of mets at 59 when I was very young), my great grandmother who I never met...she died during exploratory surgery with extensive mets, my other great grandmother who also died before I was born of bc/colon cancer. I am getting a nipple-sparing PBMX with immediate recon...so I am fortunate to have that option for cosmetics (but was prepared to lose nipples as well) but I have NO idea what my recovery will be like, what complications I will have, whether I will have ongoing pain, whether I will STILL get breast cancer anyway in the tissue they can't remove. I am walking into an unknown there. I am a very active person, and I have NO idea how this may impact me or my lifestyle. But I am doing it because I do not want to repeat my family history. It is very sad to me that so many members of my family were gone so soon, never known by the younger ones. I chose not to have children (in part because of my family history but also for other reasons..but just to show what an influence this has), but I still do have nieces and nephews, and want to know them and them to know me.  I don't consider my choice *brave*, but I sure do rail at the idea of being \"lucky\" that my *best* option if I want to really reduce my hereditary risk is amputating my breasts. I hope one day the options are much better than that. I would think Angelina would probably say something pretty similar, and I am sure she worries about HER bio kids and what hereditary risk they have inherited and what choices they may have or may not have in the future.",

      "Content": "Nov 18, 2013 07:51AM - edited Nov 18, 2013 08:01AM by DiveCat Lots of gene mutations still have not been well researched, and do not have clinically actionable guidelines. Those that do are rather limited (BRCA1 & 2, CHEK2, PTEN, etc). There really are only 6 or so that have clinical guidelines based on research. Many others still fall in that \"unknown\" category and/or are thought to be of low or moderate penetrance. There is ongoing research in these areas, but it does have a lot of catching up to do to develop the kind of knowledge that there is about BRCA1 & 2. A lot of focus really for many years has been on finding that \"BRCA3\" which I think they have determined likely is NOT there, but there may be other genetic mutations at play so research has shifted a bit to these \"others\" in more recent years. Recently the University of Washington also discovered additional BRCA1 & 2 mutations that were NOT picked up in other commercial testing...so yes, this stuff is a bit of a moving target! This can lead to some difficulties in whether or not to test for these other genes (given the absence of any guidelines for them), and how to interpret any results in terms of risk. Likely, they will look more at your family history at this point in the absence of clinically actionable guidelines, but you should talk to a genetics expert about that. It is also not fully known how other genes one may inherit may reduce the impact of mutations. For example, further research has even indicated some with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations may have protective factors from OTHER gene variations...which may explain why in some families with BRCA1/2 mutations there is a low (or seemingly absent) history of cancer. This may also be the case for you. Further, research at first tends to be limited to certain population groups, but as research goes on they often find similar mutations in other populations, though interestingly those populations may not always show the same related risk of cancer or disease that the previous population did (sometimes due to other protective genes at play, etc). I do not have a BRCA1/2 mutation, or known mutations in the other clinically actionable genes. I do have several risk variants on various SNPs (FGFR2, PALB2, etc) that are thought to confer a lower-moderate risk but non are clinically actionable on their own. What my genetic counselor(s) and medical providers do is look really at my family history which does show a high risk, and just assume for the time being there are polygenic factors or a yet-undiscovered mutation (whether in BRCA or elsewhere). They don't pay too much attention to the risk variants except to say they might be part of the polygenic factors...and to keep records of them because who knows what future research may tell me about them! Decisions are made based on my family and personal history, rather than my genetic makeup, at this point. Have you talked to a genetics expert about your result? Do they have any recommendations for you? I don't know why your doctors necessarily find it \"strange\"....we all have DNA that is subject to all sorts of variations and there is a LOT to be discovered yet! I would not give much thought as to whether the gene mutation could have come from necessarily...it is pretty clear when you go back far enough in one's genetic history there can be all sorts of genetic backgrounds, or contributions that were not \"known\" to more recent generations. My ancestry is primarily Northern European (English, Welsh, Irish, Icelandic), but my maternal DNA actually shows the presence of French, German, etc as well. I can trace my tree back a few generations, but not indefinitely, and do not know where these other lines came into play. What I can say is that people still moved around a lot even a few generations back, and not everyone can be certain of the parentage of EVERYONE in their family when you go back.",

      "Content": "Nov 22, 2013 02:01PM - edited Nov 22, 2013 02:11PM by DiveCat There is a difference between an uninformed negative, and a true negative. A true negative only can happen if there is an identifiable mutation in your family. Those who are affected by cancer carry a known deletrious/harmful mutation. If you for example were then negative for that mutation, you are more than likely to be at average risk. You are a true negative. This does not mean you are immune from a sporadic cancer, but that your cancer will not be a result of the genetic mutation in your family. There are families where a true negative person does still develop cancer. Remember that about 12% of women in North America will develop breast cancer, and around 90% of breast cancer IS sporadic (meaning no family hx of breast cancer) so sporadic cases can still exist in families with a mutation. An uninformed negative is either someone who has tested negative but has no way of knowing if there is a mutation in their family (no one who has been affected is willing to or iis alive to test) or is someone who comes from a family where affected family members have tested negative. It is known that BRCA 1 and 2 do not explain ALL hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, but they do explain about 90% of it. The other 10ish% is still an \"unknown\". It may be other BRCA1 or 2 mutations that have not yet been discovered. It may be mutations in CHEK2, STK11, and so on....or it may be a result of polygenic factors (many variants or unknown mutations working together). Being one of these people does NOT mean that your risk can be assumed to be \"average\", and your risk will be assessed based on your family history and personal factors. I am an uninformed negative in a family with a very strong cancer history, and my risk assessments have been around 40% (I have had 2 or 3 of them now) making me high risk according to clinical guidelines. This risk assessment is based on family history, personal history, breast cancer risk models, and various studies out there. Of course, this risk assessment is given to me by genetics experts, not my own self-assessment. One study by Dr. Narod for example (a Canadian study), that my Canadian genetic experts relied on, found that women in BRCA-negative families with 2 close relatives with dx under 50, or 3 close relatives of any age, had about a 40% risk.  So, a genetic test is very telling in a couple different scenarios: 1. You have affected relatives with a known harmful mutation; you test either negative to be a true negative, or positive to know you carry the mutation that causes cancer in your family (and most likely other families). 2. You do not have affected relatives available to test; you test positive for a mutation KNOWN through testing of other families to increase risk (meaning you do not show up with a variant of uncertain significance, etc). For example, no one in your family may have tested, but you do test positive for BRCA1 185delAG, which is one of the three main founder mutations. If you do not have affected relatives who have tested/can test and you test negative, the results will not be informative. Similarly, if your affected relatives HAVE tested negative, there is no point in you really testing (but see my disclaimer at end of this paragraph). Whatever is causing the hereditary cancer in your family is not yet known. Important disclaimer: it should be noted research is ALWAYS going on and new mutations are being discovered (in BRCA and in other genes) so it is important to know WHAT exactly your relatives tested for, and discuss whether new testing would be beneficial for them or you with a genetics expert based on new advances in research/testing. Ultimately, you kind of need to decide whether genetic testing is a benefit to you and whether or not it will affect your own decision making or care guidelines and what you would do if either a positive OR negative result, and how such results could be interpreted. It is really best to talk to a genetic counselor as you make these decisions, including about whether or not testing is a benefit to you or something you wish to do, and what testing is appropriate.",

These families are more likely to have more than one mutation in the family bloodline from the 3 founder mutations, which is why reflex testing for the three mutations is usually offered). There is a very good amount of research to show that those who are true negatives really are NOT at increased risk at all, unlike their BRCA+ relatives. They are at average risk. They may still develop sporadic cancer, but the guidelines are to screen them and so forth according to the \"average\" guidelines for the general population....not as high risk. I don't know any genetic counselor that would say a true negative remains at increased risk, this would run contrary to what the research has indicated.",

People don't die from breast cancer that remains in the breast (though yes, they may have complications from treatment). People die of breast cancer after it has metastatised to other parts of the body; typically with breast cancer that is most commonly to the bones, liver, lungs and brain but that is not a rule - mets can occur elsewhere. Even though it is in other parts of the body, it is still considered, and treated as, breast cancer because the cells are still breast cancer cells. Someone can have very aggressive treatment off the bat at original diagnos, and still have a recurrence. Others may opt out of recommended treatments after surgery, like AIs, and never have a recurrence. 20% to 30% of people initially diagnosed with early stage disease will develop metastatic breast cancer, though \"early stage\" does include everyone from Stage I to Stage III; so this is an average. A point to note: if you are diagnosed with a metastatic recurrence later, after your original diagnosis, you don't \"bump up\" to a higher stage, you are not \"reclassified\" to Stage IV, though on these forums women will often note they are Stage IV for the purposes of their signature and because that seems to be the common language of understanding. Your diagnosis is still considered your original diagnosis plus recurrence/mets (i.e. Stage II with recurrence to bones). Only about 5-10% are diagnosed at their original diagnosis with metastatic breast cancer and are thus \"truly\" Stage IV, the remainder are diagnosed with mets weeks, months, years, later.  Anyway, I have always liked this little xkcd comic and thought it was relevant to this topic; it obviously does not break it down into stages and specific prognosis' but the message I think is accurate (I included link in case it is too small to read:   http://xkcd.com/931/",

Just a suggestion! I am sorry your husband does not seem totally behind you...is he maybe worried about you? Just a couple cents though...the best outcome possible by any certain surgery depends on your body, your surgeon's skills, and a bit of luck. I am not a scrub nurse but I have looked at a lot of reconstructed breasts and I think results with expanders or direct-to-implant can both be very comparable, but the latter definitely needs a surgeon very experienced with doing one-steps and using Alloderm...and you need a suitable canvas to start with. I have truly seen some amazing results with the latter. I do not think any recon is as a rule better than any other, or guarantees better results over another, it really depends on many factors as what might give an individual the best outcome. By 3-steps...are you including nipple recon in there? ",

I have not heard so much of cervical or uterine cancer being related (not saying they aren't, just had not come across that before in my many looks at BRCA!), but certainly there is links to colorectal, pancreatic, ovarian, prostrate, etc. So yes, please see a genetic counselor (one familiar with cancer/BRCA genetics) as they DO look at these issues. My history is different...small family but my mother, maternal grandmother, and two maternal great-grandmothers (one also had colon) all are known to have had or died of breast cancer. I otherwise have a male-dominated family and no male breast cancer, etc. One case of prostate cancer in a younger person. No Jewish history that I know of, but I fit criteria for testing to get it covered by universal healthcare. Problem is they would prefer to test my affected relative (mother) first to give certainty to results (rather than risk being an uninformed negative and still having no answer). My mother is not interested so I am going to keep pushing for me, and eventually consider paying for it. I am still considered high risk at this point though (3-4x average risk) due to history, and only a \"true negative\" (if my mother was positive and I was negative) would take me down to average risk.",

How would they know they biopsied the area you are concerned with or not? If you are small breasted, a surgical biopsy could remove more tissue than a needle biopsy but then you risk a visible cosmetic difference in the breast, still without knowing the right area was biopsied. If a doctor is going to do harm to your body, then there must be a benefit that outweighs that harm. Be assured that a 6 week wait is not going to be a major difference to you physically, though mentally I can understand the strain. In the meantime, try not to borrow trouble. Fibrocystic changes are very common in women your age...this can include lumps, cysts (as the technician told you before...ultrasounds are very good at distinguishing between cysts and solid masses), pain, and tenderness, and your breasts may be undergoing further changes in laxity due to age, pregnancy, and breastfeeding/stopping breastfeeding. This can change that \"slope\" at the top of the breast and it may appear as a dent where the fuller part of your breast meets your pectoral muscle. Even benign lumps can change appearance of breast. Lymph nodes can be swollen for many reasons, like illness or infection, as well and 2 FNAs have been clear. Changes in the breast can be scary, but commonly it really is due to benign reasons. I have had fibrocystic breasts for years and while they almost continously cause some pain and tenderness, sometimes it is worse than others and I experience sharp stabbing pains for a while. It sounds like you have been well checked over before, and I am sure you will again. Hopefully all comes back benign again. ",

Do not rush, you do have some time. What recon is right for you is only something you can determine, along with your doctors. There is no right answer that applies to all! You can also have wonderful results with any method...failures with any method...or bad results with any method. You do not want to rush this! Your GC will review options, but actually planning your surgery will be done with a breast surgeon and plastic surgeon. You may need second and third opinions. Timeframes depend on what you choose, where you go, the schedules of the surgeons, your own schedule, your own health, where you are (wait times in some centres are longer than others) and so on. I met with my BS yesterday to start the process, and am waiting to meet with PS now. It will be 4-6 months before my own surgery, but universal healthcare can be a bit slower for non-urgent things and the two busy surgeons need to figure out when they can be in the same operating room at the same time. The timing works well for me anyway. I am doing implants, but still weighing TE to implant, or direct to implant. I have been offered nipple sparing, but am likely just doing skin sparing. If I do TEs....the process can be a year or so. If I do skin sparing direct to implant, it could be about half that. Or more. Or less. The book I told you about gives some general timeframes. Recovery varies. Some have little to no complications and recover quickly, others do not. There is no guarantee even with a PBMX you will not have complications. A young woman on FORCE recently posted that she had her PBMX this summer with TEs placed but her recon failed in September so they had to remove the TEs and she is trying to decide her next steps, she is currently flat. Of course, this is not the majority result, but if you have a wedding coming up you might want to weigh risks of dealing with an infection at a donor site, or losing an implant, or whatever else around that time.

It is most definitely NOT the recommended procedure for reconstruction with implants, whether you are going through the expansion process or doing direct-to-implant, for many reasons including the stress on the skin, thin tissues, the difficulty of monitoring lumps, higher risk of capsular contracture. If a surgeon offers to do an implant above the muscle in reconstruction I would be asking LOTS of questions about their actual experience in reconstruction, asking for lots of photos, and asking to speak to patients years out from their surgeries. Most, including the pioneer of the one-step surgery (Dr. Salzberg) do it UNDER the pectoral. I am having Direct-to-Implant and the implant is absolutely going under the muscle. The Alloderm is sewn in as a sling to support the implant from underneath where the muscle would otherwise be \"open\", it is not a substitute instead of going under the muscle. It also means the pocket required is formed immediately (with tissue expanders the pocket is formed over time).  It is not necessarily more or less painful to do one way over the other (as you can see reading threads of those with expanders). This depends a lot on pain tolerance, size of implant, nerves severed/intact, and so on. I am not sure chica what you mean by the risk of encapsulating is \"none\" with TEs...if you mean risk of capsular contracture is none because you do TEs, that is just not true. Any implant being placed means there is a potential of capsular contracture. It is however true that many surgeons, more so those less experienced in one step, prefer expanders as it does give more opportunity to tweak. But, those who are experienced and skilled with one-step can still do this either in 1 or 2 surgeries, while still saving the patient from the expansion process itself (they do revision later in second surgery, but there was no need to do expansion). In my mind, even if I need a revision at a second surgery....I avoided expanders, and I am not \"worse off\"! You are definitely correct that nipple sensation is not the goal with this surgery, and sensation is rare (some will retain surface sensation, but sexual sensation, etc is usually gone). It is really purely for cosmetic outcome, and many women also feel mentally reassured by seeing something that looks closer to their native breasts. Surgeons need to be very clear about this with their patients.",

HOWEVER, less than 1% of those who test negative on BRCA actually get a positive on BART. Those of Latin American, Carribean, etc descent are more likely to be positive on BART than those of European descent. I am one of those with a negative BRCA/BART result - and so I was left as an uninformed negative rather than a true negative as there are no know mutations in my family. Initially after testing negative I was left dealing with some uncertainty for a while and a real desire to find the one true answer for my family's cancer history. I did have other testing done and a few variations that have been linked as perhaps being lower to moderate penetrance variations in various genes (like BRCA2, PALB2, and a few others) did show up. At this point there is nothing \"clinically actionable\" or even decisive about risk for those variations, or combination of variations though so it is not like it clarified anything that way or there is much that can be done with it. Maybe it is just of interest for researchers at this point. However, for me it was enough at that point to say \"yup, given my family history it is possible that there are polygenic factors at play and these may or may not be some of them\" and accepting that I might not ever have a firm grasp of whether or not there is a 'significant' mutation going on. There may be, but it really might be the result of many smaller less significant variations to which I may never have a certain answer. My genetic counselor feels quite certain that my family history is likely the result of polygenic factors, and that is not something that at this point in time one can figure out if they are a \"true negative\" for or not. My family history also so far involves metastatic disease/recurrence in every case, most recently my mother, 8 years out of her diagnosis. I understand there can be genetic factors involved in that too, but quite frankly, it only drives home the point for me that counting on \"catching it early\" in my family has not worked out too well. For me high risk screening was not enough for me. I am hoping my surgery will increase chance of being the first woman in my maternal family to see my 60s in a long time (though I hope my mother beats me to it and can get a few good years in).",

I think we discussed this before but I was fortunate to have a very good recovery and have fairly good energy early on, but I have also heard from other women who took a lot longer so you are most definitely in the range of normal :) I have heard some say it takes about week to recover from anaesthesia alone for every hour you are under. Your body also uses lots of energy to heal! I can't remember, but if you were going into surgery already having done chemo, and so on, you may be even more \"zapped\" than usual before you begin so the surgery only adds to it. Eat well, get good quality rest, and I know it may not seem like it but moving a bit each day may actually help your energy as well (going for short walks, etc). Just enough to get blood flowing, not to tire yourself out! If it continues, perhaps ask your doc if they can check your iron levels and so on? Is it possible to return to work only part time (like mornings, or afternoons) for the first week or two? I did this when I first went back for the first week (only did half days) and I think it was a good thing to ease back into working. I am sorry that I can't recall what you do for work...now that I think about it you might be a teacher? I am not sure if that is doable to go back half time? ",

I am in Canada so things differ a bit, but I also had a PBMX with immediate reconstruction.  My BS and PS not only needed to co-ordinate their schedules with each other (which can be difficult as they not only have surgeries, but on-call times, conferences, and so on), but they also needed to arrange to find an open OR time (they wanted, as I recall, 5 hours of time). I consulted with two different BSs and PSs. The first ones took over a month to get me a date (and that date was something like 4-5 months ahead?). The other ones gave me a date within a few days after my consult with the PS, but in that case I had also waited almost 3 months to see the PS after the referral from the BS, and the BS was already on top of it and had his assistant look at dates ahead of time. Both he and the PS wanted to get me in as soon as they could because I had already done a lot of waiting! In that case, the surgery was scheduled for about 2 1/2 months from the date it was booked, which ended up being earlier than the date with the other surgeons. But, not only were these different surgeons, it was also a different hospital so availability of OR would have been different too.",

It often increases in a woman's 30s and 40s. Usually it is tied to the hormonal cycle, but not always. The catch-all phrase for this is \"fibrocystic condition\". It sucks...I have lots of odd pains and tenderness, and a few times it has been just awful, and it is all due to benign/fibrocystic issues to date. That is not to say cancer can never have pain associated with it. It certainly can and many women have experienced pain or tenderness with their cancers, but just to say that pain and tenderness do not automatically mean cancer. It is far, far more likely your pain and tenderness is associated with hormones/fibrocystic issues than cancer.",

Your previous exams may not have shown benign conditions like this unless you had certain imaging or biopsies. Not all fibrocystic conditions can be found by feel or even imaging alone. I am sorry to hear you do not feel like your doctors have given you answers to what happened before, but no, I would not recommend a mastectomy for fibrocystic breasts and benign conditions.",

I understand mx with immediate TEs or direct to implant generally takes 3-4ish hours assuming no additional complications. If you want to go bigger...you generally need TEs to stretch the tissue/skin and reduce risk of necrosis from too much stress on the tissue/skin. Direct to implant works best for smaller busted woman between A-C wanting to stay the same size or go smaller but some will do on D/DD if there is no ptosis, etc. If you want to be bigger you need to meet with your surgeon and clarify your expectations...you may not achieve that with direct to implant. It sounds like maybe there needs to be more communication on that front. As for incisions via IMF...this depends a lot on the circumstances, including surgeon preference and nipple placement. These IMF incisions used to be more common for nipple sparing, but they *can* leave a bit more tissue behind than newer nipple-sparing techniques (not always, but it is something to be aware of). I know, hard to believe newer techniques can have more visible scarring...but this is because the nipple is often being moved or having tissue biopsied & scraped. Does your surgeon intend to biopsy behind the nipple during surgery?",

As you may remember, I am not BRCA+, but am high risk. At LEAST generations of women before me, my direct ancestors, have all had BC, two of them pre-menopausal onset...all, now that my mother has just been diagnosed within last month with a recurrence, ending up with mets (I only found out this week, after my surgery). Though my official risk assessment for BC was 40%, I did not want to tempt the odds with that history. For others, like my sister, it is something they can live with. I could not. \"Catching it early\" has not proven to work so well in my family. One poster above said the PS goal with recon is to make you look awesome in clothes. Maybe every PS is different, but in my experience with myself and with many other women choosing PBMX, there is a desire by many surgeons, one that is often accomplished, in also making things look awesome without them. I have seen some fantastic looking recons. I may still have bruising, stitches, and healing tissues, but to be very honest, I am already very happy with how things even look naked. I actually think I might like their appearance much better than my originals even now, and is really did not mind the appearance of my breasts before. I am not personally that worried about loss of sensation as I had painful breasts before due to fibrocystic condition, so they had sort of lost their physical enjoyment. I have also been very lucky to have a very, very good recovery so far. I feel very good, at this point minimal to no pain, went off prescription painkillers within 3 days and onto OTC, and even the tightness is drastically reduced since drains came out yesterday, I am very mobile, have lots of energy, and am able to go for very long walks everyday, 4-6 miles (cleared by PS as long as I take an easy pace). I have even started doing some work from home in the last couple days (I tried to avoid it but, ah, I just could not!). I am relatively young (34), very athletic and fit/healthy before surgery. In fact, I feel so good I need to very consciously make sure I am still \"babying\" my arm movements and breasts. Just because I can does not mean I should! Of course recon is a personal decision, but I wanted to chime in with another positive (so far!) recon story.  I know PBMX did not completely eliminate my risk of BC, but I do know it did greatly reduce if and I feel a sense that at least I did for ME all I could. It is not the right choice for all, but for me it was, and I have not had one regret yet. Good luck in your surgery and recovery!",

      "Content": "Nov 21, 2013 06:41AM - edited Nov 21, 2013 07:06AM by DiveCat I think you need to ask your own BS what the plans are (if any) for a biopsy under the nipple during surgery. Some actually do NOT like to do this as it can increase risk of necrosis. Some also choose to core the nipple, others do not. Ask your BS exactly what tissue they intend to remove or not remove. NSM generally: I have talked about the issue of leaving the nipple with two breast surgeons, each of who was willing to provide me nipple-sparing if I wanted it, and who had provided it to many patients who did want it, but who both expressed their own discomfort with it even though I am planning a prophylactic surgery. Both did express it does leave some tissue in & behind the nipple/areola complex, and may not be my \"best bang for the buck\" if I want to avoid the ongoing intense screening and really reduce risk. Obviously even without nipple-sparing some tissue is left behind (as I think I stated before in one of your other posts, this is mostly in the upper quadrant at/near armpit) so one still has to watch for changes in their breasts but I guess it depends really on how much risk reduction you want. For someone like myself who has not had cancer, but is trying to prevent it, I prefer to remove as much as the possible offending tissue as possible but this is just my own personal choice based on my own comfort and my own feelings about my nipples and breats. I don't think that anyone who feels it is important to keep their nipple is in anyway wrong about that choice. There are various studies on PubMed about NSM in general, including what complications you may or may not expect in respect to the surgery/post-surgery itself. Here for example: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21847697. IMF: I don't think there are any very recent long term studies to show how much risk is increased by leaving the nipple, though I have seen stats of 2-4% in various places. You may want to look around on PubMed. In terms of IMF specifically, the one study I am familiar which followed over 600 women who were moderate to high risk based on family history (not BRCA+ or identified as BRCA+) who had PBMX, 90% of whom had subcutaneous/IMF incisions. 7 women in that study did develop cancer, and all had had the subcutaneous/IMF procedures...but of course 90% of the women in this study DID so that may also be the result of just the way the odds worked. This is the link to that study, note it is from 2008 however and followed the women for 14 years...so surgical techniques and knowledge have changed. It may be that they were more about maintaining cosmetics 20ish years ago, than about really reducing risk: http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199901143400201?HITS=10&hits=10&FIRSTINDEX=0&searchid=1011308833264_25014&stored_search=&journalcode=nejm&RESULTFORMAT=&maxtoshow=&fulltext=prophylactic+mastectomy& Here is a link to a study on IMF and what kind of post-complications were seen (though it does not look at the issue of risk reduction itself). While a few did have necrosis or debridement, none in this study (55 women) had total necrosis/loss of nipple: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23252505 IMF does leave the scar under the breast, which can certainly leave a nicer appearance, but I have heard of some women who do have issues with wearing bras after because of this, so just something to be aware of. I think the consensus is that it does lead to better cosmetic results, and for some women less of a \"loss\" in that they can still see their old nipples, so it really depends on your own personal comfort with leaving the nipple behind and what your reasons for wanting to retain the nipple are. At the end of the day it is going to really depend on you! I know many women who are very, very happy with their IMF incisions for PBMX.",

      "Content": "Mar 27, 2015 08:14AM - edited Mar 27, 2015 08:25AM by DiveCat Hi there, I am also an Uninformed BRCA Negative. I have had about 3-4 genetic counsellors assess my risk at 40% (not with Gail model due to my age at time being under 35 and as it is not really generally accurate for HBOC (Hereditary Breast & Ovarian Cancer) for many reasons. Mine is based on other models used for HBOC and studies of uninformed BRCA- families. Have you seen a genetic counsellor, or was is it your primary care provider or other who did the risk assessment? I encourage you to see a GC, not only for risk assessment, but as they can also review recommendations, make referrals, and so on. You may qualify for higher risk screening if you do not want surgery, or at least not yet. No one has to get prophylacric surgery if they aren't ready, BRCA+ or BRCA-. I would really encourage you to be very sure it is what you want before you go ahead, because even without recon there are risks and potential other concerns related to emotions, body image, loss of sensation, risk of ongoing pain, nerve damage, and lymphedema (a risk even with no nodes removed...low, but not absent) and so on. I don't say this to scare you away, just to say that it is important to be very sure in order to be prepared for those risks. You may be ready now, or you might not be yet, but you may be in a few months or years. It can be hard to not let the risk scare you into doing something, but remember it is a LIFETIME risk, nor a certainty. That means the risk is broken up over time....you have already outlived some of the risk. If you see a GC, they can provide an estimate of risk in smaller timeframes, i.e. 5 year risk, 10 year risk, which might help with your current decision making as well I also encourage you to check out FORCE, including the articles and message boards. Sure, lots of BRCA+ women but also many who are not BRCA+. BRCA mutations only account for about 25% of Heteditary breast cancers (which themselves only count for 10% of breast cancers) so you are not in the minority of those with risk of hereditary breast cancer. And BRCA+ lifetime risk for breast cancer ranges from 35% to 87% depending on mutation and family history, but someone with another hereditary risk or mutation can have a similar high risk, too, depending. So the decision for surgery is not just about being BRCA+ or not. While many do get surgery there on FORCE, not all do. I had a PBMX in April 2014, direct to implant reconstruction. I did just have an elective revision to switch implants. I have had very smooth surgeries and recoveries, no complications, and am very happy with my recon and that I did it, but it is always your choice, and there are women who opt out of recon with prophylactic surgeries. Again, check out FORCE. Also, check out the going Flat forums here. As farmerlucy said, if you do go flat you need to make sure your BS is going to leave you with the best cosmetics for going flat he can, not leave extra assuming you might want recon later. There are also recons that do NOT use implants (I only mention this as you said one of your reasons was not wanting implants) but rather use your own tissue. Research, talk to others, take your time, and you'll know what decision is right for you when you know it :)",

These will factor in more data than the GAIL model does. One major limitation with GAIL is that it only looks at first degree relatives, does not consider ovarian cancer, or affected male family members. Also importantly, GAIL does NOT calculate individual risk. Instead, it gives the average risk for a group of women with similar risk factors. Yes, I had a multi-gene panel myself that included BRCA as well as several others, based on my GC appointment and my family history. It is possible they may offer testing for some of these other mutations, but will likely still prefer to test an affected family member first, if possible to give more clarity to any results. The important thing to keep in mind is that only a handful of the mutations that they can test for have clinical guidelines/recommendations (i.e. such as CHEK2 1100delC which in studied ethnic groups (Northern and Eastern European) confers a lifetime risk of breast cancer of 37%), Most of them are still of uncertain risk, or based on limited studies, and don't have clinical recommendations, but I think the idea is that maybe as the database grows more information might be available.",

I am childfree myself but my reproductive organs still have a purpose, IMO, even if not for reproducing! A hysterectomy for example is a pretty major surgery and I think there usually must be pretty sound reason (like painful and bleeding fibroids) before even a surgeon would encourage going down that path.  Even those with a BRCA-mutation often \"just\" remove tubes and ovaries (the latter of which is still a big deal due to loss of hormone production) and leave uterus/cervix intact if no other issues with them as there are potential complications with a total hysterectomy as well as other \"side effects\" (some women lose orgasm, develop pelvic floor issues, or have thinning and drying of vaginal walls, etc). The great thing about removing precancerous cervical lesions is it really does work as prevention of cervical cancer. It is incredibly effective.mI had precancerous cells removed almost 16 years ago and have had clean paps ever since. Removing a cervix for treatable precancerous lesions is really not necessary and can cause more harm than good. If you do not want to be on the pill though, and do not want kids, have you considered sterilization? They can tie, cut, burn or remove tubes and leave ovaries and uterus/cervix intact.  Hopefully further imaging and testing comes back benign for you, but I really do recommend seeing a genetics counselor if you are concerned and, if necessary, getting under care of a proper high risk team who is knowledgable in this area.",

For example, in my province, there are clinical guidelines that start for those at moderate-high risk of 20-25%. Those guidelines state that those with BRCA1-2 should be consulted about preventative surgeries but those without can discuss preventative surgeries on a case by case basis. However, all qualify for higher screening guidelines. So it may depend a lot on where you live? You might find this link informative, if you scroll down it talks about risk studies with CHEK2 and how it varies amongst population and family history, which makes it difficult to pin down uniform clinical guidelines at this point... http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/genetics/breast-and-ovarian/HealthProfessional/page3 ",

In the US, uptake for a PBMX by BRCA1/2+ women, who have an average lifetime risk of BC in the 60% range (stats range from 35-87% depending on mutation and family hx), is 1/3...so majority opt out. I am not sure what it is for other hereditary high risk women, but I would not be surprised if it was even lower. I am going to say this gently as I can....most breast cancers are sporadic. So to get a PBMX as one family member has had BC, and in this case it sounds like an older second-degree member, is really an extreme overreaction. 80-90% of all breast cancers are sporadic. Having one family member, even two or whatever, is not automatically indicative of hereditary risk. Some factors can change this...early onset, Ashkenazi background, familial ovarian cancers...to indicate further testing might be a good idea but that your grandmother was diagnosed with BC does not make you automatically high risk. Of course, you do still have the average risk (and your true risk may be lower or higher) and so screening and avoiding certain risk factors (smoking, drinking, etc) remains important but no....I do not think a woman ought to get a PBMX if she is at average risk. Reading this forum skews things...breast cancer in young women does happen, but it is not that common. This is the average risk broken down over a woman's lifetime, from NCI: These probabilities are averages for the whole population. An individual woman\u2019s breast cancer risk may be higher or lower depending on a number of known factors (see Question 3) and on factors that are not yet fully understood. To calculate an individual woman\u2019s estimated risk, health professionals can use the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool. Keep in mind the average also includes high risk women too, so as BRCA1 mutations can lead to early onset cancer, those women are in there too. And no, a PBMX cannot prevent you from getting cancer despite it often being called preventative surgery. A surgeon cannot remove all breast tissue, which extends beyond your breast. It is thought to reduce your own risk by about 90%, but it does depend on the skill and caution of the surgeon, too. I do know of women who had breast cancer after a PBMX. It is also significant surgery with physical, emotional, and psychological components and with, like any surgery, risks for complications and reconstruction (if chosen) also brings with it additional surgery, potential complications, and so on. No one WANTS cancer. 1 in 2 men and 1 in 3 women will have a cancer diagnosis in their lifetime. Some people due to family history or genetics just know where it is more likely to come from and may or may not be able to do much about it. I hate to say this, but if you were to remove your breasts when it seems you have no high risk, how are you going to feel if the cancer strikes in another location anyway? I highly recommend you talk to someone professional about your anxiety, and you may also want to see if you can get in to see a genetic counselor to discuss your real risk, including if there is a risk due to your grandmother's cancer.",

In my opinion only including first degree relatives is a huge flaw that can underestimate risk.  It also does not consider age of onset. Another big flaw. It might be appropriate for those without family history, but not so much for those with. The modified Gail models do consider number of benign biopsies and whether ALH has been found. IBIS/Tyrer-Cuzick, BRCAPRO are better models for those with family history. You can download a copy of the IBIS calculator but again discuss your own risk with an expert. http://www.ems-trials.org/riskevaluator/",

I am glad they now treat it as a condition, not a disease as it isn't and I think referring to it as a disease scared too many women. I wish someone would tell the life insurance company who called me a couple weeks ago for my phone interview that it is a CONDITION that a majority of women have as they seem under the delusion it is still a disease or a \"high risk disease\"...! Yes, cancer can recur in a scar. This is because mastectomy does not remove all breast tissue. It just can't. So the primary cancer can recur in the scar or in the breast tissue that remains. This is usually a local recurrence, and is different than a NEW primary occurrence or mets. And yes, for cancers where lumpectomy is appropriate, it combined with radiation has very similar recurrence rates to mastectomy. There are cases where lx is not appropriate though. I am not surprised MX is less common there for DCIS (I imagine it is still on a case by case basis, like widespread DCIS or where a woman has a higher risk due to other atypia or a genetic mutation though). There are definitely cultural differences at play. This happens in terms of getting prophylactic mastectomies where one is BRCA1/2+ or has high family risk...uptake rates for preventative surgery can vary DRAMATICALLY across the world. I also think being properly informed has lots to do with it...not only about DCIS, but about the limits and risks of mastectomy. This can vary from doctor to doctor as well. I think it is great that you can get ultrasounds and MRIs there relatively \"easy\"...being MRI mad is not a bad thing in my view. Though MRIs do bring back more false positives they are much better at detecting cancers than mammogram..this is especially important in women with dense breast tissue as mammograms have real limitations there. It can be a real struggle for many women here (in both US and Canada) to get breast MRIs.  There are exceptions of course, but it is not routine standard of care. I can easily get mammograms, and I do, but I give a \"clear\" mammogram little weight since I have dense breasts and they may only be able to see a cancer in that case a minority of the time (estimates range between 25-50% of the time, last time I checked). Anyway, I am in Canada, not US, but I only get mammograms once a year and would not want more than that knowing the limitations and not wanting to add more radiation. As I am high risk, I do also qualify for MRI and ultrasound, but if I was not assessed as high risk I would have to \"rely\" on once a year mammograms which in my case could miss a cancer. I did have 2 mammograms last year, but one was as part of my workup for surgery. My mammograms (for last 8 years ) have all been digital mammograms, two views of each breast (one from top, one from side). I don't think this is unusual and the reason they flatten the breast is so the tissue spreads out and they can capture more tissue in the image. More views are only done if they spot something..then it becomes more diagnostic.   It is great to hear that you have trust in your medical team :)",

Obviously there is a big difference between being 50% dense and 90% dense as well. All density means is that you have a higher proportion of connective and fibrous tissue compared to fatty tissue, which is very common when hormones are still strongly at play. Density after menopause is a larger concern, in general, as most women by then have fattier breasts due to drops in hormones. All density means is that mammograms are not as good at reading the tissue...whcih is why your tech recommended ultrasounds. Mammograms are still part of it as they can see things ultrasounds can't. It sounds like your tech is making a good recommendation for you to address your density. You can also discuss possibility of MRI with your care team, as MRIs are better at imaging dense tissue (though...they do have a high rate of false positives, so be aware of that as well). Density HAS been linked to increased risk, but the studies of this as I recall were in post-menopausal women, and it is not known if the risk was as density was more favourable to cancer growth, or just meant cancer could hide from imaging longer. Still, for the average woman, density is not likely to increase her base risk significantly. As for the cyst...about 60% of pre-menopausal women have fibrocystic breasts. This can include cysts, fibroademas, pain, tenderness, and other benign fibrocystic changes. This in itself does not increase your risk of cancer. Cysts are benign, and do not increase your risk of cancer. Again, fibrocystic conditions are influenced by hormones and very common, especially in one's 30s and 40s. So, just know that the MAJORITY of women have dense breasts, fibrocystic breasts, and maybe even both combined, and the MAJORITY these of women are not at \"high risk\" of breast cancer. Only about 5-10% of breast cancer is what they call hereditary (whether due to BRCA or other genetic mutations or in that \"unknown reason\" category).This leaves 90-95% as sporadic without any or any significant family history. Many assume family history is the biggest risk factor but really, the biggest risk factors are being a woman, and increasing age. As for family history, the best advice I can offer you if you ARE concerned is to seek a genetic counselor. They can look at both your paternal and maternal family history, your personal health history, and determine your risk. Certain cancers aside from breast cancer can be linked to hereditary cancer syndromes so it is best that a counselor can assess your FULLY family history as you know it, including your mother's gastric cancer.  They can decide if genetic testing is possible or advisable, or not. I do know some certain stomach cancers for example are linked to certain genetic mutations, as an example a CDH1 mutation can cause a rare stomach cancer at an early age and also increase risk of invasive lobular cancer. A genetic counselor can also make screening recommendations based on their risk assessment. I do know they DO consider a lack of knowledge about family history due to adoption, but they likely will still need \"some\" idea before recommending all sorts of high risk screening, but it sounds like you do know some info about your mother at least.",

If you have minor asymmetry, rather than contour or padded cups (which do \"hide\" things, but you can end up with a collapsing cup on the smaller side as you should always fit to the larger side, or a complete lack of support as your smaller breast is just floating in the empty space) you might want to look at bras with stretchy lace cups or something. Are you looking for wire or wireless? I am more familiar with wired bras. For wired bras, the main thing is to find the proper sized wires for your breast tissue (they should rest on your ribcage right under your IMF, and when you scoop and swoop all your breast tissue should be within the wires...not under or escaping the wires) and then find a cup that can accommodate different breast sizes. Panache Andorra's are really good for this for example as they have a very stretchy lace in the cups that easily can accommodate slight asymmetry. As long as the wires fit around your breast tissue properly, then the lace is very good at stretching or shrinking to fit without leaving a empty space or giving you \"quadboob\". Panache is known for having rather firm wires though, which don't work for everyone. They are not inexpensive, but you can find them on sale, or order them to try on from herroom, etc, and try and then look for your size on ebay or something. For something a little less expensive, you can look at Wacoal Molded Halo or something which also has stretchy cups (many reviewers I have seen on various bra stores like them for asymmetry) and more flexible wires. Something like the Wacoal Awareness might also work for you, but it is rather full coverage bra which you may or may not be looking for. Are you absolutely sure you are in your proper band and cup size? I ask because 90% of women aren't, and if you are in say too big of a band (your band should be firm, and generally within 0-2\" of your snug ribcage measurement) you may also be having a hard time fitting asymmetrical breasts as your bra and cups are probably kind of floating over your breasts rather than actually supporting them so any asymmetry will likely be more apparent.

My job is \"mostly\" a desk job, but still involves activity, time on my feet, and can involve long days/high stress, etc. I could have managed at 3 weeks, but was still working back up to driving and thought the extra week would be good for me, physically and mentally. I did do some work from home starting a few days after surgery, but only what was really necessary. I was told not to drive until drains were out and I was off narcotics, but I found that driving involved too much at first, and I worried about being able to quickly respond without hurting anything, so I waited until 3 weeks and even than that initial drive down the block and back took some effort! It improved drastically after that. Overall I had a very, very good recovery and feel very fortunate not to have had any significant issues. My drains (I had 2) were out in a week, and I was walking 4-6 miles a day by Day 3 (I was very active before surgery though). Walking felt good for me, and was a mental boost. I went slow the first while (I was okay'ed by my PS to walk as long as I did not raise my heart rate up/break a sweat). I usually went alone, but sometimes someone accompanied me. I think walking is good as it can boost the circulation to the surgery sites. I did not notice increased drain output or anything (indeed, my drainage went down after Day 3 once I started walking). At about 2 weeks out, I was okayed to go to gym and use elliptical, spin bike, and could do some leg work, but no arm work until about 4-6 weeks out when I could gradually increase. Pain wise, once they had it under control in hospital (it took a little while to get there) I had very little issues. I was off the narcotics by choice by Day 3, and on over-the-counter Robax, Motrin, Tylenol. It was mostly just discomfort and tightness, including swelling, at that point. I did have lifting/reaching restrictions, and though I am sure some things I could manage, I did make sure to ask for help. I did not lift over 5 lbs for 4 weeks, did not reach for things above my head, etc. The first week or two my husband helped me wash my hair and such, but after that I could slowly do it though I still tried to keep elbows down initially. I was not allowed to vacuum for a while, about 3 months (but I did have recon, this may differ for you), but could sweep carefully starting about 2-3 weeks out. I could fold some laundry, but did not carry heavy loads of laundry around or lift laundry out of washer, etc. I could do some light meal preparation for myself soon after, but had to make sure things were in arms reach below shoulder height (including microwave!) and honestly, just for most part let others worry about it (I don't really cook when I don't have an excuse so that was not a huge change!). I am now over 4 months out and really have no residual issues at all, I honestly forget day to day I even had the surgery. I am back to my regular routine, including scuba diving and hauling heavy tanks, weights and such :) No physical therapy.  I don't feel any restrictions/issues. I do my own scar massage, etc. I did do stretches as time went on. I should note my surgery was prophylatic, so I did not have nodes removed and did not have to contend with the effect of other treatments on my recovery, energy levels, etc.",

There are certain types of cancers that if seen grouped in a family can signal hereditary cancer risks, like colon, ovarian, skin, and breast, but also just as you had breast cancer, a benign polyp, and a father with colon cancer (at a later age) does not mean you do carry a genetic mutation either. My counselors were not overly worried about my grandfather's colon cancer, or another relative's colon cancer, as both were diagnosed at a later age (one had also breast cancer many years earlier) and likely their cancers were more due to aging, but did still consider it in context of many other cancers in family (several breast cancers). There are no known genetic mutations in my family (and I tested negative for BRCA-mutations and other genes they tested for including the one associated with Lynch Syndrome). So at this point it just remains something to be aware of and to screen for. The great thing about colonoscopy (as unpleasant as it is) is that not only is it screening, it is preventative...like a 2 in 1...since precancerous polyps are removed during the procedure. If only every screening method could have such an advantage!",

The biggest risks for breast cancer are being a woman and aging, so breast cancer cases in later years are usually more indicative of sporadic, rather than hereditary, cancer (but not always).  On your side, given both were past age of 50...and your grandmother into her 80s, it is still very possible they were sporadic cases, rather than genetic, but not necessarily and hopefully you have had genetic counselling to review these issues before BRCA testing. If not, please get a referral. You should discuss these issues with your genetic counsellor. If there is no known BRCA gene mutation, breast cancer in a primary relative after menopause may increase base risk (which is not the same as the average risk)moderately, but not much...but a series of breast cancers that are, say, predominantly pre-menopausal, can point to other hereditary risks or mutations and higher risk. BRCA-mutations account for about 25% of hereditary cancers (which in themselves are about 10% of all breast cancers).",

You might be thinking of hereditary cancers, which include more than BRCA-related cancers but still only account for about 10% of breast cancers. 90% of breast cancers are sporadic. OP...has someone in your family tested positive for a mutation? What is your family history? You do not HAVE to get an ooph or take Tamoxifen if you have a mutation. There are various screening and preventative options, and it is ultimately always your decision. Many women choose screening only, or wait to get an ooph only once they are done having children if they do, for example. Some choose not to get an ooph as their family history does not show ovarian cancer, etc.  I can't advise you about having children, I am childfree and that is a personal decision but many women who are BRCA+ do choose to have children, knowing it is not certain they will inherit, and hoping options are better in the future, and knowing there are always risks of inheriting conditions...at least BRCA-mutations can be tested for. Having a mutation is not a guarantee of cancer, it just increases chances, but the truth is 2/3 men and 1/3 women will get cancer in their lifetimes anyway....at least you kind of know what to screen for with BRCA-mutations. ",

Only about 25% of hereditary breast cancer is due to a BRCA-mutation. If you come from a family with high rates of breast and/or ovarian cancer and none of those affected members are BRCA+, you may still be at high risk for hereditary breast cancer. BRCA-mutations do NOT explain all hereditary risk. There are other potential mutations, or maybe yet to he discovered mutations/genes. This is why it is very important to talk to a genetic counsellor or other genetics expert. I have seen way too many oncologists, OB/GYNs, family doctors either grossly overestimate OR underestimate risk. Having two primary relatives (like a mother and sister) with breast cancer is one of those factors that can \"flag\" cancer as hereditary, be it due to a BRCA mutation or otherwise.  For some of those who do not come from BRCA+ families but do have a strong family history (or just don't know as no one has been tested), being told \"not to worry until or if it happens\" can seem a little patronizing and dismissive. Especially as many of us have dealt with that in the medical community already because many non-genetics experts have little understanding of hereditary risk, or that it can exist without BRCA. And wait for what? Until I too get diagnosed with advanced cancer and face a future of metastatic disease like my loved ones?  My mother was originally told she was at lower than average risk (6%) by an oncologist, though her mother (who had two primaries) and two grandmothers both had breast cancer, all between 48-60. 2 of them died of it, one later died of colon cancer. My mum was diagnosed with Stage III ILC at 48, and now has metastatic breast cancer 8 years later. I will always wonder what the outcome may have been if she had been recommended for annual MRIs (her mammograms missed it) or been advised of her risk by a genetic counsellor and given options of Tamoxifen or surgery.  While no guarantee, it might have meant my mother would be in a very different position today.  I don't mean to sound prickly, but the only way someone can know whether or not to be concerned about their own risk if they have a stronger family history is to talk to a genetics counsellor/expert. They may indeed still qualify for high risk screening (like MRI) and preventative measures (like chemo prevention or surgery), qualify for genetic testing (BRCA or other genetic testing) and so on. Or maybe they will be assessed as average or moderate risk, and really can just not \"worry\", and instead follow the recommendations for the average risk population. ",

I have had a few breast specialists over the years, and all like to leave benign cysts and other lumps alone unless they are causing significant issue. Basically any surgery causes scar tissue, which complicates later imaging, which can lead to further biopsies and so on. So, if it is benign they like to leave it. As you are aware, it is very common to have these benign lumps and bumps, especially in your 30s and 40s. I know you had a hysterectomy, but are you on hormone replacement therapy or anything of that sort? As some have pointed out, reducing caffeine can help. Some have also found benefits from Evening Primrose, but be cautious of the contradictions and discuss with your doctor.  My own breast specialists hand out pamphlets on Evening Primrose as they have found their patients to get relief from use.  However, if you are on hormone replacement therapy I am not sure how that may play into it for you. I still think of course it is VERY good to be proactive and to get checked out when there are new changes. I hope everything turns out benign for you!",

I have had asymmetry from my very first mammogram at 27 but it is just benign fibrocystic changes which are very, very common in pre-menopausal women. Chances are very high your asymmetry is benign too but they need to be sure and to have it recorded for future imaging. 3% of asymmetry means only that....it does not mean they are all malignant findings! It IS vague and not a \"negative\" finding on its own. I understand the concern...I cone from a high risk family so I'd rather not have anything but a boring clean image, but as I said for me it has always been just (very common) fibrocystic changes. You said your mother, step-mother, and great-aunt had lung cancer & cancer in brain too...was this breast cancer mets (which is not same as lung or brain cancer)? If you are concerned about your risk due to your family history, you may want to consider talking to a genetic counselor to get a true understanding of your risk and look further at your family pattern to see if testing is a possible option. Remember that 75-85% of breast cancer is sporadic (not hereditary) so even though your mother & great-aunt (who is a third-degree relative) both had bc you may not be high risk yourself. Best to talk to a genetics expert though!",

My risk was estimated at a 40% lifetime risk. I had a prophylactic mastectomy and pathology came back clean (no cancer, only other hormonal changes). But, I am 34 and a lifetime risk is exactly that, a lifetime risk and it is not 100%. I may have never got breast cancer, I may have got it at 70, or in my 40s like my relatives, or in 2 years. And, quite frankly, as a mastectomy does not remove all risk, I still may get breast cancer (however, my risk has now been reduced significantly and my risk is now estimated to be below average). Being high risk is not a guarantee you will get cancer, and if you do get cancer there is no real way to determine \"when\" it would happen. It's a guesstimate at best (say for example you have a family history of early onset breast cancer, in one's 30's and 40's, you may be able to guesstimate that IF you did get cancer, you have a higher chance of also having early onset breast cancer, but again this is STILL not a guarantee you will get cancer, or that if you do you would get it at the same age as your relatives).",

High risk recommendations here start at 20-25%, but even then things like preventative surgeries at that 25% are more on a \"case by case basis\" rather than \"recommended\" as they might be for someone with an 80% lifetime risk. The higher risk of \"87%\" for breast cancer in BRCA+ women is actually based on the original studies which involved certain mutations, and certain families. Now they know that is not the case for all families/carriers (http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/BRCA): Breast cancer: About 12 percent of women in the general population will develop breast cancer sometime during their lives (4). By contrast, according to the most recent estimates, 55 to 65 percent of women who inherit a harmful BRCA1 mutation and around 45 percent of women who inherit a harmful BRCA2 mutation will develop breast cancer by age 70 years (5, 6). Ovarian cancer: About 1.4 percent of women in the general population will develop ovarian cancer sometime during their lives (4). By contrast, according to the most recent estimates, 39 percent of women who inherit a harmful BRCA1 mutation (5, 6) and 11 to 17 percent of women who inherit a harmful BRCA2 mutation will develop ovarian cancer by age 70 years (5, 6). It is important to note that these estimated percentages of lifetime risk are different from those available previously; the estimates have changed as more information has become available, and they may change again with additional research. No long-term general population studies have directly compared cancer risk in women who have and do not have a harmful BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. It is also important to note that other characteristics of a particular woman can make her risk higher or lower than the average risks. These characteristics include her family history of breast, ovarian, and, possibly, other cancers; the specific mutation(s) she has inherited; and other risk factors, such as her reproductive history. However, none of these other factors is as strong as the effect of carrying a harmful BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. The \"average risk\" covers the risk for ALL women in the population, so it is skewed by those who are high risk, and those who are very low risk. The individual \"base risk\" for most women is actually a lot lower than the average, like 3-4%. I think a lot of the differences between the three models in assessments is also greatly explained by the factors they consider. Using the Claus model for example, many women who come from families with male breast cancer, or ovarian cancer, or more than 2 relatives, would potentially be assessed as lower risk they they might really be (from the study you linked): The BRCAPRO model requires a family pedigree as the only input, including age of the individual, ages of relatives, age of onset for particular cancers, and ethnic heritage. This model is designed to predict who is a BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 gene mutation carrier and who is at the risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer. The BRCAPRO model is based on a Mendelian approach that assumes an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. In contrast, the Tyrer-Cuzick model includes family history and a number of other inputs: the individual's age, family history of breast and ovarian cancer, age at menarche, parity, age at first childbirth, age at menopause, use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT), Ashkenazi Jewish heritage, history of breast biopsy and atypical hyperplasia, lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), height, and body mass index. The model is a statistical model based on the Mayo Clinic Benign Breast Disease cohort, which is made up of 9,376 women, age 18 to 85 years, who had an open breast biopsy between 1967 and 1991. Finally, the Claus model includes the number of first- and second-degree relatives with breast cancer and the age of cancer onset. The Claus model was developed from the cancer and steroid hormone (CASH) population-based, case\u2013control study involving 4,730 patients with histologically documented breast cancer and 4,688 matched controls. This model is based on the premise that breast cancer risk is transmitted as an autosomal-dominant trait and bases the statistical calculation on the genetic relationships between the affected relatives and the woman in question. In terms of outcomes, the lifetime risk of breast cancer estimated by the Tyrer-Cuzick and Claus models includes the risk of both invasive breast cancer and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), where BRCAPRO predicts only the risk of invasive breast cancer. ..... The widely used version of the Claus model uses family history of only female breast cancer in up to 2 relatives. While a modification of the Claus model includes ovarian cancer, we did not use that model and instead used the model put forth in the ACS guidelines and used by the ACRIN 6666 clinical trial  I was assessed with both BRCAPRO and Tyrer-Cuzick and my results were quite comparable between them with the Tyrer-Cuzick being a bit higher. The Tyrer-Cuzick allows a lot more detailed input and I saw how those factors like parity affected the results and of course if it considers risk of non-invasive cancer that may also explain the higher result. My counselors also referred to Dr. Narod's studies of BRCA-negative families with multiple cases of breast cancer, which found around 40% risk for non-affected relatives. In my own family it is likely there are polygenic factors at play (and I have had other testing for research purposes which supports this likelihood...but there are no clinical guidelines in that case at this point and they just refer to family history). All that being said, I agree prediction is in its infancy. I just did not feel comfortable waiting for it to grow up!",

I really don't like when doctors skip that step....it is a very important part of the process as a negative result when there is no identified mutation in the family does not mean you are necessarily low risk, and there are other potential hereditary mutations aside from BRCA.",

For certain reconstructions, like some tissue flap surgeries, there may be even more surgeons in the room at the same time. It seems to be a bit different everywhere, but here I found breast surgeon I liked, consulted with him, and found out who he preferred to work with for PSs, and from those chose what PS I preferred and was referred. After my consult with PS the PS and BS talked more about my surgery and sorted out a date. Both went into OR with me. I also consulted with another breast surgeon and PS at one point, but just felt best about the team I ultimately chose. I also have known women who picked the PS first and worked back from there. Where I live you need a referral to a PS though, so I worked the other way around :) I recommend you pick up a copy of Kathy Steligo's Breast Reconstruction Guidebook, it is very informative about your options, the procedures, and what you can expect.  ",

All Along88, I am sorry you feel that Jolie's choice was about financial resources. Truth is, she had a very strong family history of BC and OC, and an Ashkenazi Jewish background, her relatives BRCA status was known to be positive, and so she was a candidate for testing in the US, as others would in that situation according to guidelines through their own insurance, etc. Not everyone qualifies for testing, because most cancer IS sporadic (90%) and even BRCA mutations are only responsible about 25% of hereditary cancers. Genetic testing would have been of little benefit for the majority of people who do get cancer. That is not a financial resource thing, but a practical criteria thing. She is BRCA1+ and therefore under guidelines also had access to preventative surgeries, high risk screening, and so on, as do other women....not just famous ones like AJ....do. I am in Canada, with universal healthcare, and she would have been a candidate for free testing here too just based on her family history and ancestry, even if it might have taken a while longer. I had genetic testing, though an am uninformed negative, due to my own family history.  I just had a PBMX last week due to my family history and risk assessment. I do not consider myself \"brave\", but I do recognize there is difficulty in making a decision to remove healthy breasts, and go through the risks, troubles and pain of mastectomy/reconstruction (and side effects) when the chance is there I also may never have got cancer. Most people in my life seem to realize that as well. I do not like being called brave, but I also do not appreciate my choice being ticked off as \"meh! who wouldn't do that...\" because really, many would not. And that is a very personal choice that they have the ight to. Even amongst BRCA+ women in the US, uptake for a PBMX is only about 30%. In Canada it is less than 25%. In other parts of the world it is more like 5%. I respect greatly that AJ went public about her choice, despite a LOT of backlash about it (comments about her just wanting a boob job, for example...HA! She is AJ, if she wanted a boob job, she would have had one! Like she did before! It is asinine to think a MX is anything like a boob job!). But, I also know others do not support it. And as I indicated, not everyone would do it even if they had foresight. My own mother who had a Stage III dx, a double MX, 8 rounds of chemo, 6 weeks of rads, now 8 years of anti-hormonals....would not go back in time and do a preventative MX. She still does not understand why I did it in many ways.  So yeah, making that decision knowing that there will be that kind of response is not an easy one. Never mind being so public about it.  I can absolutely understand why people are upset about Amy Robach's comments. On Stage IV forums, and elsewhere. I do not have cancer at all that I know of, and I find her comments rather frustrating and just more pink propaganda. She is a public figure, and there is a responsibility there to communicate accurate information, if you are choosing to communicate about a personal issue. She did not have to be public about her personal battle, but once she chose to be, I do think there is a responsibility there and she failed to meet it. The idea that it is \"toughness\" that beats cancer may be what she needs to personally cling to deal with her own diagnosis, but it is irresponsible to spread that message as a universal truth. Many, many tough men and women die of cancer every minute.",

No cognitive dissonance here. I also do not see how your use of the term applies to the posts here. You will note that I actually do not have cancer. I am (was) however at high risk for breast cancer due to genetics. What I am against is victim blaming and conspiracy theorists coming on here to raise false alarms. As for the chemtrails, please provide me minutes and details of those alleged meetings. The common term for those trail clouds is contrails (condensation trails), not chemtrails, so I would want to actually see discussions of CHEMtrails, and not just discussions on high air traffic, noise pollution from air traffic, visual pollution by contrails, and the like. The idea that the government is secretly releasing other substances into the environment through chemtrails is indeed nothing BUT conspiracy theory. I challenge you to provide any non-conspiracy theorist sources for otherwise.Maybe you should do your own due diligence before attacking others?",

It is good your doctor however is being proactive and recommending a baseline so that they have something to reference when you start regular screening. Fibrocystic condition can increase as you get into your 30s and 40s so it will be helpful to have the comparison if anything more concerning does appear. I had my first baseline at 26 or 27, but that was because of a strong family history of pre-menopausal/early onset breast cancer and they wanted me to start \"regular\" annual screening at 30.",

Chemtrail is NOT a common term outside of conspiracy theorists. And the comments about \"androgynous so-called males\"? No words that have not already been said. I am a Canadian woman but am going to borrow that lovely saying from my sisters much further South: \"bless your heart\". That is even too kind for someone expressing such sexist attitudes Breast cancer - and other cancers - predates airplanes, trains, cars, hormonal birth control, vaccines, hormone-injected meat, fluoridated water, plastics, x-Ray machines, and on and on. The biggest risk factors are being a woman and getting older. Period. 90% of breast cancers are sporadic, meaning there is no known genetic or hereditary cause. Certain things are supposed to increase risk, certain things to decrease risk, but nothing can eliminate risk. I've know lifelong vegans to get breast or other cancers, and decades of pack a day smokers and heavy drinkers to die cancer-free. ",

My mammograms read as having asymmetrical heterogeneous density, particularly focused in outer upper quadrant and behind nipple-areola and have the same \"disclaimer\" that lesions can be obscured in dense tissue (this is because dense tissue shows as white, as do lesions/cancers). I don't trust mammograms alone for me, but that is due to my own high risk/family history, but the density alone is not something I consider suspicious.That disclaimer can be a little unnerving, so I understand your reaction though! Your radiologist will use your past mammograms to compare with your new mammogram. If you do notice any lumps or something that do not show up on a mammogram, you may want to discuss possibility of a follow-up ultrasound or MRI with your radiologist. By the way, I always follow up and ask for a copy of the actual radiologists reporting letter to my primary care doctor, rather than just rely on the \"all clear\" notice. I keep these in my own personal files so I can see myself what they are reporting on and observing. I have seen a handful of times times where women saw their past reports later only to find out that a radiologist (or radiologists) had been watching a certain area for several mammograms, deeming it not needing immediate follow up/biopsy, before it was raised as an issue. This way if I do have concerns, I can go for a second opinion with my breast surgeon or whatever to discuss it further.",
