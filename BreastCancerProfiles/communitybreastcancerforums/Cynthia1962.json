What the hell is wrong with me?  I hate feeling like this.  Could the Arimidex be contributing to my emotional state?  I started it on the 11th, too.  If so, will the effects lessen or will I absolutely need an antidepressant?   Will an antidepressant help me stop crying?  I tried my valium, but it just helps with the anxiety. Any suggestions?  Thanks in advance.

It helps a lot to know that I will eventually get to another new normal. It just seems so hard to imagine at this point. I really appreciate the encouragement and advice. I'm glad to know there are options out there if I need help dealing with my dx. I plan to investigate the resources available to me as soon as I can. My husband has agreed to deal with the insurance companies regarding the crash and that has taken a lot off my shoulders. We are still discussing the option of getting a lawyer. We do agree that we definitely won't take any less than what the other guy's insurance owes us, especially since we aren't expecting more than what the accident actually cost us. Thanks so much everyone for your warm welcome and help! You're lifesavers!! Cynthia",

I get bone scans every 6 months. I think you need to ask your onc how she will determine if the Arimidex is working.  Her answer will help you decide if she's the onc for you.  Good luck and sorry you had to join us. ",

Iin my opinion, something is alternative because there is no evidence it works.  Once there is science-based evidence of effectiveness, it becomes medicine and ceases to be alternative. As for the FDA persecuting those who claim to have a cancer cure...is it \"persecution\" if the person claiming to have the cure is really just preying on desperate people for money?  If there isn't proof that it works, then it is illegal to say it \"cures\" cancer or anything else for that matter.  So, it isn't persecution when the FDA shuts them down.  It's enforcement of the law. ",

I have different \"states\", too.  I think they are: ignore, reality, optimism.  I can ignore my situation when I need to function on a day-to-day basis.  My children help me with this because they are so egocentric.  When they aren't around, I can use distractions to keep me in my \"ignore\" state.  Keeping busy by volunteering at their school, cleaning house, playing video games, reading, etc. help.  My \"reality\" state can go in one of two different directions.  There's the 'I need to prepare myself and my family for my eventual demise so I had better plan ahead and get busy' form, or the 'this totally sucks and is so unfair, why is this happening to me, am I going to die soon?' form.  I'm not fond of either form of the \"reality\" state.  Then, there's the \"optimism\" state which is my favorite.  I can acknowledge that I have cancer, but I feel it's going to be okay because a tx will come along that will help me live at least long enough to get my children old enough that I feel okay leaving them.  It's my favorite because I don't have to ignore my situation totally so it kind of feels more true.  And, it could come to pass.  No one really knows what the future holds.   I also have a couple of general coping mechanisms which I've had since my original dx. which are: there's always someone worse off than I and remember to take it day by day or even minute by minute, if necessary.  My latest coping mechanism is: \"It is what it is\".  It works for a lot of different situations and helps me to accept what is and deal with it with less emotion.  It reminds me that I don't need to judge everything to just put one foot in front of the other and move forward. Mary, I hope you can find something that helps you get up each morning, and look forward to your day. Sometimes, mine is as simple as my first cup of coffee in the morning.  Try to notice in your life whatever makes you happy or even content, no matter how small, or silly, and work to make that happen more often.  When I'm in a particularly awful \"reality\" state, I use \"Damn You, Autocorrect!\" because it never fails to make me laugh.  Hang in there, and best wishes for feeling better and finding a tx that works.  Cynthia",

I doubt I'll hurt that much if I hold my arm still.  Right? I'm going to try to catch up on all the posts here and see what I can learn.  Thanks for any help you can give me! Cynthia",

I can'twait to see it when I can take the bandage off tomorrow. I have had minimal pain.  I was so amazed when I could move my arm and even lift it some right after surgery.  It was so different than last time.  I took a Darvocet when I got home just to be safe, but I've only used Advil since then.  It just feels sore and kind of achy.  Not bad at all.  I'm so relieved.  I felt comfortable being home alone with the kids today and all went well.  Unlike yesterday, when they took advantage of Grandma and convinced her they were allowed to do things they aren't.  Then, my daughter caused the toilet to overflow, too.  My poor Mom!!! Thanks everyone for all your help and encouragement.  It was kind of emotional getting a port again, especially one I'll always have, but I just refused to think about it and focused on the benefit I'll get.  And, both my nurse and surgeon say my veins will improve now with less use.  So, that will be nice for blood draws since I go to a lab for those. It's great going into a new situation armed with all the knowledge and experience I get from you women here.  I mention you a lot to doctors and nurses because I get most of my info from here.  I love how we help each other out!  It's nice to not feel alone.

That one won't last.  Stupid veins.  They used to be so good.   The surgeon will try to get it in my \"good\" side, but I'm very petite and very thin, so there's not much room to move it around if my vein there has contracted too much from the last port.  He will try, though.  Thanks for being concerned.  I think I'm just over anxious because it's a new surgeon AND a new hospital.  And, the hospital is a smaller community hospital that is more laid back to the one I'm used to.  But, that's sort of good, too.  I'm a person to them and not a number.  Change is good, change is good....",

I was asleep the first time because it was put in when I had my lumpectomy.  I'm a little nervous about being awake this time.  But, I'm sure it's doable.  My surgeon decided which one to use and the placement, too.  She did a good job, but she didn't have a lot space to work with because I'm so petite. I'm told that the Navelbine is very caustic and if it leaks out of a vein, it will damage the surrounding tissue so a port is necessary to get it.  I didn't realize it was recommended for Gemzar, too.

I recently saw my gyn again for a consult on the Tamoxifen tx and how much I'll be screen.  You need to find yourself a caring and competent gyn to help you through this.  Good luck on your search for a surgeon.  If possible, try to get one that specializes in breast cancer or does a lot of those surgeries.   A good gyn should know of one and many practices also list their expertise on their websites. Wishing you all the best, Cynthia ",

At first, I told my daughter's educational coordinator at the charter school we homeschooled through, but no one else there.  She didn't really understand and eventually asked me what my prognosis was.  She was shocked when I told her.  Eventually, I met with a few other people at the school to go over some test results concerning some learning issues my dd was having and I vaguely shared what was going on and why we wouldn't be homeschooling next year.  I later learned that the secretary that sits outside the director's office heard what I said and asked my friend about it.  So, far, she's the only person that looks at me with pity.  Everyone else treats me as if nothing has changed.  I plan to eventually tell my kids' new teachers at the new school, but I'm gonna wait until it matters.  Right now, I'm doing great except for a few down days due to Aredia or Arimidex.  I'm never sure what causes what.   And, of course, my irl support group knows.  Other than that, I pretty much keep it to myself and life goes on.  Eventually, it'll be more obvious that I'm ill and then I'll share.  ",

Reflux can also make it seem as if you can't breathe, too.  So, maybe, this could the situation for you.  Try Pepcid or another med for reflux and see if it helps.  Also, I was told to take Claritin or Benedryl to help with the side effects of the Neupogen so I imagine they would help with Neulasta, too.  Good luck and congrats on finishing your first chemo!

I'm sure someone with more experience will answer your post.  I'm sorry I couldn't be more help.  Hang in there!",

Many doctors still do blood tests every three to six months. This may include a blood count (CBC) as well as CEA, CA 15-3, CA 27.29, and liver blood tests. Many patients and physicians assume that using these tests to find metastases early improves outcomes. Unfortunately, we have lots of data that this is not true. This also holds true for the routine use of bone scans, chest X-rays, and CAT scans. This doesn't mean that we as individuals won't think finding our mets earlier isn't beneficial to us in some way.  I'm glad mine was found early because it gives me more time to prepare myself and my family while I'm still feeling relatively well.  It just means that it may not make a difference in overall prognosis. ",

I hope it's a long time until you really need to discuss things with your daughter.  I hope we both get a chance to see them achieve some important milestones.  Hugs. Cynthia",

I'm going to ask my onc or gp if xrays would be a good idea.  It could just be the mets on my spine or the ones in the groin causing a reaction in the whole area.  After reading everyone's responses, it sounds as if it could be a lot of different things going on.  I guess that's just the way of mets.  Rose - I'm glad you're on your feet and doing better.  No worries!  I think it's good for me to consider all the possibilites because I'm a planner and I hate surprises.  I recently began paying attention to the people around me in public who are using assistance to walk so I have some idea of how it's done.   Thanks everyone for your help!",

I've been hoping the situation would improve, but it seems to be getting worse.  I keep telling myself that it's the cooler weather, or the fact that the Megace has given me severe constipation.  But, maybe, I'm just kidding myself.  I have no idea if the Megace is working or not, but I know my onc really wants to give it the chance to be effective.  I'm just so afraid of falling and breaking a bone and it's becoming very difficult to take care of my family when I can hardly walk or bend over (thank goodness for my claw).  What do you bone mets gals think?  Could the constipation be making it worse?  Is there anything I can do to help this situation?  I'm sitting on a heating pad right now, but it doesn't seem to be helping.  I tried Flexeril yesterday, but it didn't seem to help.

It's impossible to know how fast your mom's mets might progress, but it's a good sign that it's been so long since this recurrence.  Your mom has a lot of options especially since it sounds as if she is in good health otherwise. It's a good idea to write down your questions for the next time you see the onc and make sure you get the answers you want.  Best wishes to your family. Cynthia",

I told her I had bc, and that my drs were going to do everything they could to help me get better, but that I was going to be tired and sick and lose all my hair.  It gave her the opportunity to ask me questions and to tell me about her fears.  It also let me not have to be so strong in front of her because I felt like crying a lot and did.  I also bought a couple of books written for children of moms with bc and she would ask me to read them to her.  Sometimes, I couldn't get through them without crying, so my husband would take over. It was a year ago this month that I received my diagnosis, and I'm doing great.  My family and I made it through my treatments and it wasn't all bad and not nearly as horrid as I imagined it would be.  My children weren't traumatized and I think my daughter grew a lot from the experience.   Best wishes, Cynthia ",

As for possible meds for non-Stage 4's, I think it's just Tamoxifen, and the AI's.  Correct me if I'm wrong.  So, I don't know what women who can't take those do.  I'm glad you seem to have found a competent onc finally.",

I take or am given benedryl and advil/tylenol prior to the Aredia to help with side effects.  The first time I felt as if I had a  mild case of the flu in terms of achiness and fatigue. Now, I mostly feel tired for a couple of days and sometimes slightly achy.  Taking benedryl and advil helps. As for the Tamoxifen, side effects vary a lot from woman to woman.  I had hardly any, just mild hot flashes and some achiness.  It doesn't relate to it's effectiveness.  Good luck!",

Another thing I learned which I should have known, but didn't, is that doing things to lower one's risk isn't cummulative .  So, for instance, I breastfed two children for a total of 58 months, rarely drank liquor, didn't smoke, was a vegetarian, avoided known carcinogens, ate organic often, wasn't overweight, took supplements, etc., but these habits didn't combne to lower my risk to nothing.   Cynthia",
