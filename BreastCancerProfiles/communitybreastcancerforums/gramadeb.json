When he would call or come over he would always tell me he loved me and say \"we will get through this\". One thing I remember was when I lost my hair - he said \"remember Mom, this is only temporary.\" A simple statement like that really helped keep me looking forward. You are already doing a good thing for your mom by coming to this site. Encourage your mom to visit also. Don't be afraid to ask questions.

I now have all my brows but the new ones are so light you cannot see them so I still look weird if I don't use brow powder.

When your new hair starts growing it will be very soft. I found myself always touching it - felt so could to feel hair on my head again.  It may come in white or gray also.

The back got wavy very quickly but sides and top were just starting to wave. This past weekend, the wave became a more pronounced curl. I was working in the garden and it was very warm outside.When I came in the top of my head was very curly. Thought it was from the humidity and  it would go away after a shower - but it stayed. The sides are frizzy curly, back and top are more wavy and \"softer\" curling. It's like I have 2 different kinds of hair. When I went back to work on Tues after the long weekend my co-workers could not believe the change. Artsee - mine started with a few waves. I did have some wave in my hair before chemo - but not very much. Those of you waiting for curls - I hope you get a fun surprise and those little hairs start curling real soon! Take Care Deb",

A little tired but no other side effects the first week.  I hated the thought of chemo, but in the long run it will be worth the peace of mind. 1 down - 3 to go! Artsee - how long after chemo did your counts drop? I don't have blood work drawn until just before next chemo in 2 weeks. Deb",

Now this week it is just the opposite - everytime I eat I have to run to the bathroom! Do you feel up to walking or moving about? That helped me on my first round when I couldn't get things going and Senokot was causing me intense cramps. Deb",

Still impatiently waiting for a real hairline again. Right side of top is growing better than left side. Still very white color but starting to get darker strands - have a 5 o'clock shadow on sides and back. I look like a Q tip on top! I had thick, course, straight hair before chemo - would love to have curls. Your posts are encouraging - I have no patience to wait for my hair to grow back. I guess I will keep touching my soft, fine new hair - in a year I will probably be complaining of having a bad hair day! Deb",

I want to do whatever I can so I can see them grow up and be around for great grandchildren. Kim - I get frustrated when health care professionals think we know everything because we are nurses. I don't volunteer that information and find it is easier. When I had my biopsy I didn't tell them I was a nurse but they soon figured it out because of the questions I was asking.  That worked to my benefit because they knew I understood what was going on and the doc finally was up front and said she was pretty confident it was cancer - I appreciated the honesty. take care Deb",

Worked in various ICU's until 1986 when I became a flight nurse for a Level One Trauma Center. In 1994 started working in EMS Education and have been the manager for 10 years. I no longer do patient care so my schedule is pretty flexible. My director has been very supportive during chemo and radiation and was told to take as much time as I needed. I took the week of chemo off, then would work 2 etc. During radiation I worked except for a few Friday's when I was  too fatigued to do anything. I chose to work as much as I could - was a good distraction for me and helped me keep as much of a normal routine as possible. Take Care Deb",
