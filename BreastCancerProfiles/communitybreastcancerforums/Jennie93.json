My cancer was found on routine mammogram, there was no lump, just a sort of \"harder\", painful spot that everyone had been telling me for years was \"just a dense spot, nothing to worry about\". Since the mammogram didn't pick it up until it was pretty big, my onc. sent me to get a PET scan before surgery just to make sure it wasn't anywhere else. The only thing that showed up was a spot on the other breast. So I had to go in for another biopsy. This was a very different experience from the first one. The doc said it looked benign, took several samples instead of just one, and they injected a tiny \"clip\" as they call it, a little marker that will show up on future mammograms. When the results came back it was indeed a fibroadenoma. They told me these are totally benign and they don't do anything about them other than keep an eye on it and compare future mammos to these, to make sure there's no change. I asked about the \"clip\" and they said its a way of marking the spot to say \"we already biopsied this lump and it was benign\", so if the lump is noticed in the future (I never could feel it) they would know not to worry about it. I said, that makes sense, but what if that spot turns into cancer later and you have marked it as \"no concern\"? They said no worries, that just doesn't happen. Hope that helps set your mind at ease.",

The reality turned out to be very, very different, which came as a surprise since I never imagined it might turn out that way. The left side of my chest looks like it was scooped out and the skin is tight over the ribs which are sticking out (who knew they were so uneven?

For me, I could not tolerate tamoxifen, so switched to anastrazole, which actually has a worse reputation for joint pain, but for me it has been considerably better than the tamoxifen. Do I still have joint pain, yes, am I still gaining weight, yes, but both are much less than on tamoxifen. And without the issues of blood clots, uterine cancer, and so many medication interactions. I did have osteopenia already when starting the AI so that is a concern but we will just see how it goes. I figure I can always quit if it becomes intolerable.  ",

Something that most women could never do no matter how healthy. Well, this commercial said that one of the contestants was a BC survivor. All I could think was, HUH??? How is that even possible, did she not have any lymph nodes removed? I mean my LE lady said absolutely NO pushups, or anything else where all your weight is on your arms, NO heavy lifting, nothing overly strenuous, no repetitive movements, and so on. Did she not have chemo, radiation, and the evil tamoxifen or AIs? All those things wiped me out to the point where I don't think I will ever have a fraction of the strength I had before. Not to mention the crippling joint pain. It just blew me away that this could be possible...... And made me feel pretty inadequate..... Even though I know my experience is far more typical.......

The only negativity about the story from this corner is about the way the media has presented it as \"no big deal\". Well sure, it was no big deal for her - she didn't have cancer! She had small incisions and got to keep her skin/nipples intact. She didn't have any lymph nodes removed, which is the cause of 99% of the pain & impairment we have to deal with. Forever!!

It took a lot of trying to find something that didn't. A few sports bras fit all right, the Genie bra is not bad (but get 2-3 sizes bigger than the chart says you should), and the \"Cami Shaper\" fits pretty well if you want some light compression. I've seen many recommendations here for camisoles rather than bras, and with cooler weather coming that might be a good option. The mastectomy ones are awfully pricey, but sometimes you can find regular ones that have removable foam pads, and the pockets are usually big enough for foobs.  ",

I don't remember anything about the recovery room, the first thing I was aware of was when they slid me off the gurney onto the bed in my room.  I was sort of half awake and remember thinking \"I hope they don't expect me to be any help in this process\" but they had some kind of slippery sheet or something and they sort of roll you back and forth, slide you across, and there you are.  When I woke up all the way (not sure how long that was) my hubby was there and he gave me some ice water to sip.  That was wonderful since the drugs gave me the most awful dry mouth (something that has persisted somewhat even now, very strange).  You won't be able to reach it yourself for awhile. Practice a little bit ahead of time sitting up in bed with your arms crossed in front of you, using only your abs to pull yourself up.  We naturally tend to push ourselves up with our arms and you sure won't be able to do that for awhile after surgery. I don't think you will know anything about the lymph nodes for awhile.  I didn't even know how many they took out until the preliminary path results came back in about a week.  I had the sentinel lymph node thing, all the docs said beforehand that they felt totally normal and looked normal on the tests they did, but did it \"just to be sure\".  Well they ended up taking out 6, and 4 were positive.  So that was unexpected and disappointing. I didn't find this place until after my surgery, I sure wish I had, because I had no clue what to expect.  Not one of the docs or nurses warned me ahead of time what it would be like.  I just figured the incision would hurt, but it would heal, and then I'd be fine.  I wish I had known about the numbness, the pain and tightness in the armpit, the excruciatingly sensitive skin.  Would it have made it any less painful?  No, but I can cope so much better with things if I know what to expect ahead of time.  Now I'm just wondering if I will ever have full use of my arm again..... Also read the threads about lymphedema.... No one ever said a thing to me about that, never even heard of it until I found my way here, but it sounds pretty unpleasant and it makes sense to do anything you can to reduce the risk of that happening.  So far no problems there for me, but again, it sure would've been nice to be told ahead of time! ",

There is a seam that goes right over the thumb knuckle and is very painful. If I fold it back the thumb turns blue pretty fast.

Question is, I now have to go on a fairly long flight and there will be no access to any kind of medical advice where I'm going. Is it better to use the sleeve only, no gauntlet, while flying, or do without entirely? Or should I try getting a glove from someplace like lymphedivas? Better to experiment or no? Are they returnable if it doesn't fit? And if my arm does blow up, presume it is not wise to try to squeeze it into the sleeve at that point, correct? ",

She gave me exercises to do at home every day, said to stretch until I can feel the pull, but not to the point of pain. I have been doing these ever since (about 2 years now) and that's what has restored my ROM almost completely, and reduced the pain a good deal. But, the 2nd time I went, I got a different PT and she had the attitude that the cords could be massaged away, or broken up, or something. The LE lady had warned me never let anyone massage that arm, ever again. But this PT gal said she knew all about LE and acted like she knew what she was doing, and I stupidly believed her. Hindsight is 20-20 of course. But I should have stopped her the minute it became painful. Anyway, long story short, the next morning I woke up with a big puffy swelling right in front of the armpit, and now I get to live with that for the rest of my life. Oh, joy.  ",

It's not hard, they just have you take a deep breath and hold still while they zap you. It isn't long enough to be unpleasant, no worries. They did the original CT simulation both ways, with the breath holding and with normal breathing. I guess it's not always needed, but in my case they decided it gave a better angle or whatever. It pushes the heart out of the way a little more. Hope everyone is having a great weekend, resting and healing.",

Secondly because of the pain and cording in my armpit, I'm not able to get my arm into the position they need it to be in, so he sent me home with a brochure describing some exercises I'm supposed to do, for a week and a half, then come back and try again.  Frankly I don't see what good that's going to do.  And it upset me because all this time I've known that something was not right, that surely it wasn't normal to have this much pain this long, and all the drs just kept brushing me off, saying things like \"it just takes time\" and \"everyone is different\".  And they would not refer me to PT which maybe would have helped.  So I'm just a wee bit peeved right now, you could say.....

But what you said about the stretching exercises was interesting because I had a little \"aha moment\" today.  I suddenly realized that what the doc said, to \"reach until it hurts, then back off\" was not quite right.  That's what I've been doing all this time, and it hasn't improved one bit.  I realized that what I have to do is stretch until it hurts, and then a little bit more.  Which is hard.  But pushing it not just up to the point of pain, but a little bit past, is the only way to see some change, I believe. I have an appointment with a lymphedema specialist next week.  I'm hopeful that she can give me some good advice.  I understand that having radiation to the lymph nodes puts me at high risk for lymphedema, so I'm meeting with the specialist beforehand to talk about anything I can do to hopefully prevent it, or at least lower the risk.",

Now unfortunately after 7 weeks of rads the pain & tightness seem to be getting worse instead of better, and I have pain around the scar too which I never had before.

Well it did get smaller, very slowly and gradually, and changed from slightly pinkish to normal skin-colored. But it never went away completely. There's a small, like about a quarter-sized spot, that still has a little fluid there, even over 2 years out. It's tender but not downright painful, unless something presses on it. The docs just shrug and say no big deal, leave it be, nothing to worry about. But I wonder if some sort of massage or something might encourage it to go away. Anyone tried that?",

Honestly, I met with 4 different doctors beforehand, and even my own mother who had a mastectomy many years ago, none of them told me this. I was led to believe this surgery was no big deal, I would heal up and be fine and go back to my life like nothing happened. Can you believe my surgeon actually told me I'd be \"back to normal\" in \"about a month\"?? I just wish they had been truthful with me from the start. The fact is, if you have any lymph nodes removed then you are at risk for lymphedema for the rest of your life. Certain precautions and restrictions forever. And it seems very common for at least some pain and impairment to hang on for a very long time. I don't know why none of the docs said one word to me about these things, but I wish I had been told beforehand. I'm the kind of person that likes to know what to expect.",

You will find rads much easier than chemo, almost certainly.  The every day part was the hardest thing for me.  I had a super wonderful RO who told me exactly what to expect every step of the way.  Skin started getting pink about halfway through, but no discomfort until the last week.  One spot in armpit got blistered and raw.  The worst days were about 4-6 after the last full field zap.  So it does get worse for a little while after.  But they gave me some silver-something(?) cream which was very soothing and it healed up fast. Your RO will tell you what to use on your skin and when.  Some only want you to use certain things.  Others say whatever feels good.  Either way be sure to wash it all off before you go there each day.  Mine said to use pure aloe vera or a water-based cream (no oils or oil-based creams) but toward the end when it got ouchy then they gave me Aquaphor.  Don't buy anything yet.  I had seen lots of people recommend Miaderm on here, and looked it up on Amazon, very expensive stuff!  And as it turned out my RO gave me free samples of the stuff they like, anyway.  So wait and see. You will probably be told to drink lots of water, eat plenty of protein, and avoid any supplements during treatment (a basic multivitamin is ok but no antioxidants).  You will probably be more sleepy than usual.  That's about it.  You will do great!   :-) Bets4bama -  I don't think you can blame the rads for the eyelashes...  mine hung in there all through 4 months of chemo and then started falling out 6 weeks later!  Bummer!  Come to find out that is actually not uncommon.  But they grew back really fast.  About the time the bottom lashes were all gone, the new baby ones were already starting to appear.  ",

There is no way to know. But you mentioned you are doing chemo now, and the point of that is to kill any of those rogue cancer cells. 2) Generally speaking, radiation is not necessary after mastectomy, but that changes if they find positive lymph nodes.

Went to see RO, he thought it might be a fluid pocket or something (which could be drained, if that's what it was) so he sent me over to get it ultrasounded to find out what it was. It turned out to be a lymph node. Enlarged, but otherwise normal looking. Nothing to be done about it, it's just irritated from the rads, probably, and all we can do is wait for it to settle down. Sigh. I said, I thought they took out the lymph nodes from my armpit? He said, not all of them. Interesting.",

They gave me Silvadine too when the skin got raw and it was oh so soothing! It heals up quick. At one point my RO asked if I wanted a prescription for something for the itching - guessing that's the 2.5% cortisone? I said no because I was doing ok with the OTC cortisone cream and emu oil. He also said if it's keeping you awake, try some Benadryl at bedtime. It's an antihistamine so helps with itching, plus it tends to make you sleepy so you can sleep through it. One caveat though, depending on how far out from rads you are, you may have started on tamoxifen by now, and if you're taking that, then don't take Benadryl. But for those still in treatment, passing it on, maybe it will help.",

I fear the numbness may be permanent but the shooting pains are, I'm told, a sign of nerves trying to regenerate, so I think that will ease in time, it just takes awhile.",

So, I went back to the RO for CT \"simulation\" and as the lady tells me to strip from the waist up, in comes the assistant who is a very young, very cute guy.  She asks me if I mind, and all I can think of is Websister with the 2 Joes.  LOL!  I was pretty sure that all modesty had long since vanished but admit to a few twinges of embarassment when they were peering at my chest, drawing on it with sharpies, etc.  LOL! This whole BC thing has surely pushed me way out of my \"comfort zone\" in soooo many ways! I guess they enter all the pictures and measurements into the computer and it gives them a formula for the exact angle or whatever.  I go back in a few days and they will make any little adjustments needed, do the tattoos, and start the treatments.  I'm not looking forward to this rads thing at all.  But not because of the actual treatment, it's the tedious driving up there every day, ugh.  It's going to waste a huge chunk of my day and the thought of doing that for almost 7 weeks is just overwhelming.  But I know that somehow we manage to get through whatever we have to do, and as I kept saying all through chemo...  This too shall pass.",

I wish I had found this place before my surgery, better late than never! They have all been awesome. We need someone to talk to that gets it, to get through this thing. One thing I wish I had been told at the beginning - don't let anyone rush you or pressure you into any quick decisions. There really is no rush, take enough time to research your options and feel at peace with your choices. Liefie - we are all with you in spirit, hope you are feeling great today & will be back home very soon! Caitlin - sounds like you know exactly what things to ask the new RO, you will rock this too I'm sure! My MX was the left also, and they removed some of the chest muscle too (to get clean margins) and my RO had me hold my breath during the rads and it worked perfectly, he said the heart was completely out of the field. So don't be afraid, but ask about the breath-holding thing if they don't mention it. One week post rads and I feel great! Just one little spot still red, the rest has faded back to pink, really all quite do-able. Feel free as a bird without that long drive every day! Benny - we love & miss you, hope all is well and get that computer fixed soon so you can check in & tell us you are good. Everyone else - hope all have a wonderful day with no SEs, no bad weather, no cockroaches! LOL! :-)",

I need to ask for prayers, nothing major, just been having a little rough spot. Is it normal to have these emotional swings or should I blame it on the tamoxifen? (LOL) I was so happy at the end of rads, thinking all this was over now and I could get back to my life. But it hasn't worked out that way. The armpit pain & tightness never went away, well it all got worse all of a sudden and I'm thinking, seriously, why now? WTH?? Plus crazy mood swings, I start tearing up at the dumbest things, NOT like me at all!! I think maybe while we are still in active treatment, whenever we feel yucky we blame it on the treatment and figure it will get better eventually. But then when treatment is done and everyone around us thinks we should just magically be \"back to normal\", but then we still feel yucky -- and it hits like a ton of bricks that maybe it's never going to get better, that there is no going back to normal, that maybe the pain and impairment is something we have to get used to now. Which is tough to accept. Sorry to whine but this is the only safe place where I know I can vent. And I know you all understand, too.",

Omeprazole was a wonder drug for me, took that pain away in a matter of days. Because of my history of ulcers they had me take Ranitidine every day all through chemo and for a couple months after. I think it did help, so keep taking the meds, the tummy should settle down soon. Hope everything else is feeling better! Just realized I am 5 months PFC today. Wow!

Maybe they just want to be sure you aren't too low, beats me. Then they had me come back 3 months later, so 4 mo PFC, and they didn't even do any bloodwork then at all! I was surprised and a little disappointed, was curious to know if I was recovering, or how much. You'd think they would want to know. Been on tamoxifen about 3.5 weeks, can't say I've noticed any SEs other than I've gained 5 lbs in that time without anything else being different - who knows - it does scare me a little! My weight stayed the same all through chemo and rads, now this?? :-( But really my big problem now is the pain/tightness/cording in armpit from the lymph node removal. It's not getting better, have been to PT twice now, the 2nd time they massaged the area quite painfully and the next morning it was swollen and sore. I had never had any swelling there ever before! So now I'm freaking out about lymphedema, is that how it starts? I tell you what, if I knew then what I know now, I would have told the surgeon not to touch any lymph nodes!!! That is the source of all the issues I've had ever since surgery! The MX itself, no biggie. Chemo and rads, no fun but when it's over, it's over. But the pain, limited use of arm, and fear of lymphedema is FOREVER. Sorry for the whine, but I know you all understand, and I have no one else to vent to. Hugs to all!",

The day of my first chemo they showed me a short video, which talked about SEs that might occur and what to do about them, and they also gave me some brochures with more detailed info. They also gave me prescriptions for Compazine (for mild nausea) and Ativan (for more severe nausea, and it's also good for anxiety and insomnia). I used the Compazine and that always worked well for me, I never needed the Ativan. During each treatment they would first give me a big dose of Benadryl, then a bag of Decadron (steroid), both of which were to prevent allergic reactions to the drugs, and a dose of Zofran, to prevent nausea. Then came the chemo drugs, one at a time, very slowly. The whole process took 5-6 hours the first time and 3-4 hours the rest of the times. They gave me the Neulasta shot to bring home and inject it the next day. Then 3 weeks later when I went for the next dose, they would draw blood first and check to be sure my counts were all good enough to get the next round. Everything kept going down, down, down every time - except the white cells which the Neulasta kept high - but never so low that I had to postpone the chemo, or get a blood transfusion or anything like that. Pretty much everything they told me I already knew from reading here. I did take the Claritin the day of, and several days after, the Neulasta and I think it did help. It wasn't as bad as many have reported. The first one was the worst. 3-4 days of aches & pains. Not fun but bearable. My MO really had very few instructions for me. Said don't take vitamin E or anything with estrogen. Suggested I take Zantac for the duration, because chemo can be tough on the stomach. Said don't eat anything spicy, fried, or rich. Would probably regret it. I more-or-less followed that advice. Nothing really tasted good anyway. Only time will tell what SEs you will have, but everyone here is so wonderful, there's sure to be someone who had the same thing and can tell you what helped. I am eternally grateful to BCO and all my sisters here, it got me through. And I know you will get through it too. We are all in your pockets! :-)",

The interesting thing, to me, is that so many women on here have opted to remove both, and that was never even presented to me as an option.  The docs here have the attitude to leave the healthy one alone.  They even said that my chances of getting it in the other one was only minisculely elevated from someone who had never had BC in one side.  (Not sure I believe that.)  I didn't find this excellent support community until after my surgery.  I felt like they really rushed me into the surgery.  This is what you need, there are no other options, nothing to think about.  I don't even remember if my surgeon asked me ahead of time whether I would be considering reconstruction sometime down the road (I would have answered no).  I have no interest in having surgery to attach a fake boob, but now that I have only one, it is a little weird at times.  I'd almost rather have none, if I had been given the choice.",

She finally admitted that it doesn't mean a specific weight since everyone is different, it means \"something that you have to strain to lift\", in other words, more than what you are accustomed to. So I was comfortable going back to doing the things I had been doing before, which might seem \"heavy\" to some, but not if you have been doing it every day all your life. I was told to wear the sleeve if I'm going to be doing anything more strenuous than normal everyday activities, or going on an airplane. I have worn it all of once. Honestly it's so uncomfortable I feel like it might do more harm than good. I have not gotten up the nerve to fly anywhere yet. That's more scary to me than any kind of physical exertion.  Edited to add...... There are some things I no longer do. Like pushups (something I was able to do before, but due to losing a pec muscle on one side, can't really do anymore) or weightlifting with arms. I do exercise videos but concentrate mainly on the ones that work the legs and core.    ",

Yes this will be a not-much-fun Christmas for us all, but it's just one out of many and we will all celebrate together next year when this is all behind us and we feel good again.   :-)    The emotional roller coaster is so tough, I just try to take one day at a time and don't feel bad when you have \"down days\", just keep remembering \"this too shall pass\" and tomorrow will be better.  Hugs to all!",

That said, my experience has been that the LE experts didn't tell me anything I didn't already know from reading here, and were no help at all, honestly. It was free because we had reached our out-of-pocket max, I sure wouldn't pay for it. Some have said the opposite, though. I have mild truncal LE which has, so far, not spread to the arm, as far as I can tell anyway. I have tried everything to reduce it - MLD, dry brushing, compression, exercises, etc. and none of those things make any difference at all. It increases and decreases somewhat, on its own schedule, which is entirely random. It's often worse when I first get up in the morning, maybe I roll over to my side when sleeping and compress it, or maybe the lymph flows better when you are upright and moving around, who knows. As far as flying goes...... I recently flew for the first time since surgery, and after a ridiculously difficult decision I chose not to wear the sleeve/gauntlet, (and the arm was fine), I did wear a compression tee on the first flight but forgot it on the second - there was no change either way.

I have talked to the RO and been referred to the PT, they seem to think it can improve some at least. I think the main thing I have to work on (mentally) is letting go of my anger toward all those people who told me nothing about the troubles that lymph node removal causes, and that some of these changes are permanent. All of the docs I saw before my surgery talked about the MX, what it would be like, warned me about the drains, all that stuff, you all know. Even my own mother, who had a MX many years ago, said nothing about the lymph nodes thing. All those people led me to believe that it would heal up and I'd be back to my old self. And that is so not true! I'm reminded of my surgery every time I reach forward to wash my hands or any of the thousand everyday things we do. And even if the pain eases someday, the list of things we cannot do with that arm for fear of triggering lymphedema is long and forever! So, yeah, still trying to wrap my mind around the fact that we are changed by all this and there is no going back. And trying to let go and forgive all those people who should have told me this ahead of time, and didn't. I don't think I would have made it through without all of you.

And does something to help instead of patting you on the head and saying \"these things just take time\". Anyway he sent me for an ultrasound on the lump in the armpit, thought it might be a fluid pocket or something. It wasn't. And I'm very glad yours wasn't a blood clot!! But knowing what it's not, doesn't help too much in making it better, does it? So he insisted on PT and I made it through the first visit. She said it can get better, really, but will take some work and some pain. Gave me exercises to do every day, said come back in a week, see how it goes. No reason you couldn't start doing some stretching exercises yourself now, just very gently, and if you notice increased swelling then back off, too much. I hope you get in to see the LE specialist soon! They are super helpful.",

The aching-all-over part has actually been a bit less every time, but the nausea a bit worse every time.  The sore mouth was worst after #1, but the sore throat is worst after #4.  Had no issues with fingernails after #1 & #2, but the tenderness in the nailbeds started after #3 and got worse after #4. (even though I put my fingers in ice during the taxotere part during #3 & 4, but not #1 & 2.)  Twitching eyelid started after #2 and has been unchanged ever since.  Watering eyes started after #3, hot flashes after #4.  You just never know what's in store, I guess.  My hands get sore every time, but the numbness in the fingertips didn't start till after #2, and that does get worse each time.  The skin peeling off my fingers was moderate after #1, terrible after #2, but only mild after #3. Anyway, you just never know, so hang in there.  It seems like #2 has been much better than #1 for you, at least.  Maybe they will tweak your drugs/dosages again and next time will be a walk in the park.  (We can always hope!)   :-)",

Gained a ton of weight on tamoxifen and when it hit 30 lbs my rings were uncomfortably tight and not easily removed, so at that point they came off. The right one was half a size bigger so I was able to put that one on left side. It would feel too strange not wearing anything as I've been married for over 30 yrs. I am aware that it might have to be cut off some day if my hand swelled suddenly, but it's a risk I'm willing to take.  ",
