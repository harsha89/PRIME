Or the fact that my mind is still getting used the fact that my cancer returned like 7 months after the initial treatment was over. I have Triple Negative BC. I just found out last Friday that I have mets in liver, bones and lungs. I am hoping to live longer than the 6 month prognosis that was given if I don't do any treatment. I will post more as things develop. And I will be very interested in any advice! :) Sue",

I still can't eat pizza yet. :) I do have the red bumps and they are itchy. I try not to scratch too much, but they are all over my back, arms and getting to my legs. I look horrible!! No shorts for me! :) Anyway, does anyone have any creams or lotions that might help. I am using Lubriderm. I would take a Benadryl, but that would make me sleep. I am tired enough as it is! :) I looked up the milkweed balm, but that seems like it's more for pain. Sue",

THAT is what is keeping me feeling crappy. I have lost 15 pounds in 2 months. My mouth hurts, though no sores. My esophagus is swollen from throwing up so much. I feel like I have a huge lump in my throat. Any ideas? Maybe I am not taking my zofran correctly? Sue ",

Hopefully, that will show something more effective. I am going to talk to her about this. I am really miserable. I am not a whiny, weak person. I can handle a lot. I still have to care for my disabled adult children and run a household, but I just don't know if \"living\" like this is worth it. I quit work. I am on LTD. Thanks goodness I was smart enough to take out that policy! :) I am a teacher and we don't pay into SS, so no SSDI for me. I will try the salt and baking soda. It can't hurt!! :) I keep seeing the ad for Little Ceasar's Pizza on TV and I want to eat it sooo bad!! I can't though because of the sores. Anything acidic still hurts. Thanks for responding!! :) Sue",

My tummy feels better and I want to eat, but the sores in my mouth are awful. :( I can still only tolerate protein drinks and popsicles. I have lost even more weight! I got a script for \"magic mouthwash\" but that only numbs some of my mouth (the part that doesn't hurt!) for about 5 minutes. The only thing that seems to ease the pain is 600mg Motrin. I am due for round 3 in 2 weeks and I am thinking about telling the doc to just stop. I don't even know if the Doxcil working. I cannot do this anymore. I will take whatever time I have left and enjoy it! :) I haven't gotten the hand/foot issues, but I am sure that is coming. Thanks for listening to my whining, but I am really at witts end!! Sue",
