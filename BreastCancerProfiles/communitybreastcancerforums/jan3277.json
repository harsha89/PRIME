I STARTED BACK TO WORK MID-MAY.  I GOT THE EXPANDER OUT AND THE IMPLANT IN AT THE END OF SUMMER.  I AM GETTING THE LAST STAGE JANUARY 13,2009, THE NIPPLE.  AND I CAN'T WAIT.  I THINK IT WILL REALLY HELP ME MENTALLY.  AND MAKE ME FULL HOLE AGAIN.  IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FEEL FREE TO ASK.  EVERYONE IS TELLING YOU THEY UNDERSTAND, BUT UNTIL THEY HAVE BEEN THROUGH ALL THE STEPS, THEY DON'T.",
