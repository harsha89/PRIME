Both doctors suggested mastectomy, but one suggested nipple sparing version. Can anybody let me know the risk on that? Â Also, the plastic surgeon from UCLA showed me some pictures of the before and after pictures, they looked very bad with obvious asymetry. Very scary. Does anyone know good plastic surgeons around this area? I'm sure there're plenty but don't know where to look for: never thought I would look for one. Thanks!@!! Log in to post a reply",
