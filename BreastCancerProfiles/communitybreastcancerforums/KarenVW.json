My hair falling out was a trip.  I have very thick curly hair and at first I was just brushing out lots of hair, but not very noticeable.  Yesterday (Day 17) I took a shower and out of nowhere I got the biggest matted knot in my hair - worst than any dog or cat I've seen.  :)  I tried for an hour using oil, etc. to get it out, finally gave up and had to cut it out.  When I went back in the shower to wash my hair again, well out it came - not all of it, but enough that a wig or hat looks better.  Definitely what I would call \"A Bad Hair Day\".  Oh well, it will grow back . . .

I am gearing up for TC #3 tomorrow so back on the 'roids today.  Hard to believe I will then have only one more treatment left!!  Paulingmom, you can sign me up for the October rads group. I've been very interested in everyone's posts regarding the potential causes of breast cancer, especially the emotional aspects.  There is a book titled \"Awakening Intuition\" by Mona Lisa Schulz MD, and she talks about the ill health effects of not fully expressing your emotions.  In her book, she addresses emotions associated with each part of the body, and for the breasts, it is often related to putting the needs of others ahead of your own needs.  Many of us are probably terrific nurturers and caregivers, but raise your hand if you spend more time taking care of others and not enough time taking care of yourself (my hand is up).  Dr. Schulz also points out the connection between the breasts and nurturing. On a lighter note, I stumbled on a discussion thread called \"Let's conduct our own study on how we all got breast cancer \".  Check it out if you want a good laugh.   ",

(although I know there are no accidents).  I was surfing for info to relieve my anxiety about starting chemo this week and found this incredible group of women over 2 hours ago.  Since then, of course, I had to read all the previous posts.  Thanks for all the great info, laughs and tears.  For starters, I immediately copied the 'must have' list of items to buy pre-chemo, and e-mailed for my free wrap.  And I too love the Titanic and dessert quote.    I am a single mom with two terrific children, aged 15 and 14, and blessed with very caring family and friends. When I was first diagnosed, I was told I would likely need chemo, then after surgery was told I might not need it, then told by my oncologist I should do it given the grade 3 diagnosis.  I was given the choice between CMF and TC, and am planning to do TC x 4.  Thankfully my lumpectomy was relatively easy, but approaching chemo makes it all SO REAL.  OK, I admit, I am scared of the chemo, and actually rescheduled my chemo start date a week later because my head & heart just weren't in the game (and I know I need to be 100% committed).  So now my start date is 7/23 and I want to thank this group for changing my view of chemo from being a harmful poision to being 'magic juice' and 'scrubbing bubbles'.  Only you could make this happen.  :) I look forward to a getting to know all of you better!

PauldingMom - sorry to hear about your mother - I hope she will be joing us. It was fun seeing the insomniacs last night.  If I had known you were up I would have chimed in.  I am definitely wired on the steriods.  Perhaps we can start a late night steriod group  :) Today was a VERY bizarre day for me.  When I stepped on the scale in the onco's office my phone rang, and for some reason I answered.  It was my mother-in-law telling me my ex was in the ER trauma unit (we are friends).  He passed out while driving and hit someone head on. My first thought - is this God telling me to run out of here??  When I confirmed he was not going to die, I decided to go ahead with the chemo given I postponed starting last week, and then headed over to the hospital.  He is pretty banged up (collapsed lung, broken ribs, serated spleen, etc), but quite frankly lucky to be alive.  And of course, we are concerned about why he passed out.  The irony is he was supposed to take the kids on vacation this Saturday, so THANK GOD this didn't happen with the kids in the car. Overall my chemo went very well.  Not what I expected though.  I figured I would listen to my meditation tapes and go to sleep in the comfortable lounge chair.  Instead I met some amazing women and we gabbed and gabbed the entire time - all of us strung out on steriods.  I feel good - no side effects yet - drinking lots of water, sucked on ice chips during treatment, trying to eat lots of protein.

One of my biggest issues has been hot flashes.  They started the day after treatment and WOW!  I never had a hot flash before.  I feel like I'm overheating and it takes forever to cool down.  Happens at least 2-3 times a day.  Any one else having problems with hot flashes?  Any suggestions for how to manage them?
