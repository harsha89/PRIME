I called right after Mammogram & ultrasound and they told me to wait until she gets back and I should get letter soon explaining the results. Letter was general form letter with return in 3 mos in bold along with probably benign. Nothing in detail at all lime others have received.",

Any thoughts on what this could mean? Thanks. Log in to post a reply",
