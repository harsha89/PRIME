I have no idea what stage of cancer it is, or what my treatment will be. I am having another biopsy on Thursday this week to determine if there are no pre-canerous cells in some smaller lumps scattered throughout my breast. I have spoken to a friend of mine that is 12 months into her treatment, she has given me reason to believe that I will recieve better treatment at another hospital that is close by. The hospital I am attending at the moment are always being fined for not following guidelines and women are dying because of this. It has filled me with horror that I might become one of those women. My question is ... has anyone else asked to change hospitals for their surgery or follow up treatment, and if so what do I need to do to get the ball rolling? Time is of the essence here ladies as I don't want my treatment delayed because of this change. Thank you so much in advance Â x Log in to post a reply",
