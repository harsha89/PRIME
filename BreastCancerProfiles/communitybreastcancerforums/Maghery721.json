I was grateful to not have chemo during the summer months and am sorry you will have to deal with treatments during that time. Since you have been through AC already I think you are through the worst of it. I suffered the most on AC. I had 4 taxol treatments and only had to deal with minor neuropathy. I did not experience any nausea side effect on taxol. I was still experiencing hot flashes but they were beginning to subside. While I know everyone is different and may experience different effects, I just wanted to let you know my experience with taxol and hope you do not have any bad side effects. I've been on herceptin since December but have had no side effects from it. I will have to wear my wig through the summer as I don't think my hair will be at a length i will be comfortable with by then so that is going to suck - wig + summer = one nasty bitch (that would be me)! Good luck ladies with your treatments.",

I had a BMX with immediate implant reconstruction in February. I went home with 4 drains pinned to my shirt and also had a pain pump which was held in a small nylon bag that had a shoulder strap. When I went to my 1st PS post-op appt, he removed the pain pump, and then his nurse suggested putting my drains in the nylon bag and she proceeded to then tie the bag around my waist - it turned into a fanny pack. Genius! It was the perfect solution and I no longer had to fumble around with the safey pins. Wish I knew about it for my first few days post surgery, would have made things easier. Hope this suggestion is helpful to you. And good luck to you all on your surgeries.",

LOL. :-) I haven't read too many of the comments on this thread but certainly will to catch up and get to know everybody. I did see one post that caught my eye from J-Bug discussing implants and wanted to add my recent personal experience. J-Bug's comment was that she was surprised to hear that one of the posters on this thread had implants and didn't think implants were an option. I'm assuming J-Bug meant that she didn't think implants were an option to those with large tumors (please correct me if this assumption is wrong, or if the implant discussion resulted in a satisfactory answer). I am referencing the implant subject because I did have implant reconstruction and my tumor was 10.5 cm. I do not believe the option of implants is based on tumor size, in the large majority of cases. I believe one of the many criteria it is based on is whether the surgeon can perform breast skin sparing surgery to preserve enough skin (as well as basing it on what the surgeon sees when he operates - my surgeon said he planned to do the implants but it all depended on what he saw when he opened me up - I do not know the details of that though, and as long as there was enough of a clean margin between the tumor and the skin and he was comfortable enough to spare the breast skin). The other option for implants is to have tissue expanders implanted - usually done when there is not enough skin to place the implant during surgery. One reason that implants might not be offered may be for those who will have to have radiation. For years they have not recommended having an implant if you will have to undergo radiation because of the effect the rads will have on the implant. Lately they (PS and RO) have been coming around to the idea of allowing implants prior to radiation but providing patient with information about the risks and possible harm that can occur to the implant. I've read in a number of posts about the fact that radiated skin is difficult to work with and that if I waited I may have not been able to get implants. I wanted implants rather than the flap surgery b/c my PS said that the most he could do for me is to make me a size B breast. That was not acceptable for me b/c I was a DD for most of my life. However, I got the implants with the knowledge that if the implants failed and/or I was unhappy with them, I had the option of the flap surgery (I hope to avoid this since it would be another surgery for me and it would be a very long and intricate surgery). Please note that all of this info is just my personal experience and from things I have read (I'm not good at remembering statistics and things like that) and I would be the first to admit if something I write is wrong and I welcome any suggestions. Look forward to \"meeting\" you all! Best regards, Cathy",

I had it rough during the 4 AC treatments. Just so glad that chemo is over. Everything else has been a piece of cake. I would do 10 BMX surgeries before I would do chemo! I'm sorry to hear about your reconstruction limbo. It sucks to be stuck when all you want to do is finish up everything and put all of this stuff behind you. Good luck and I hope it works out for you soon.",
