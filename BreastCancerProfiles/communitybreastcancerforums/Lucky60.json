They are for someone with breast cancer on the left side only--the left glove goes up to the bicep (with elastic at top) the right just up to the wrist. They are not real tight, just custom fit leather to my arm and a little stretchy. They're to protect you from getting poked by roses and things. There is one small nick but it doesn't go all the way thru. They are plain light grey leather (soft inside) and were expensive at the time, so I'd like them to go to someone who can use them. I'll cover shipping in the U.S. also. For sizing, my hands are medium, I would say, 5'4\" tall and while I'm not overweight, my arms are a little muscular. Please send me a private message if you would like them.",
