I had scans last week, spent the last seven days in scanxiety before seeing my oncologist today. I had a feeling that the news would not be good...I was on Femara since diagnosis in September 2010, had mastectomy in June 2011 (to improve my QOL), and switched to Faslodex in November when last scan showed progression in my lung lesions. Well it didn't work. The lung lesions have increased in size (the largest is 1.5cm) but thankfully there are no new ones and it hasn't gone anywhere else. Although I didn't have any bad side effects from the Faslodex, my biggest disappointment is that I have wasted a great deal of $$ (I have a $2500 deductible) on a treatment for four months that did absolutely nothing. Now I have three options..1) Good ol' bottle of Tamoxifen (just finished reading a host of horror stories including deafness). 2) Try 3 weeks of Taxol. Or 3) a clinical trial with Aromasin and a new drug which is administered in a weekly infusion with the off chance that I would be one of the unlucky ones to get a placebo. I decided to give the Tamoxifen a try and will get scanned again in three months (which will coincidentally be around the one year anniversary of my mastectomy). I feel comfortable with my decision but of course would like some input.

I was trying to post a message during my infusion but between the benadryl and the temperamental keypad on my tablet, I was having a hard time. Lynn-even though the area around my port is bruised and sore, I didn't feel the stick at all. The nurse was very patient and explained everything. I used the Emla cream about an hour before. They told me that it is not uncommon to have discomfort for a few weeks until things heal, so that was reassuring. Maybe it's my imagination, but it actually feels better since it was used. And it was great not to have anything hanging out of my arm and I won't have a bruise. I hope this helps you find your \"happy place\". I understand how having the port makes it seem like chemo is something \"permanent\" but in reality it is. I'm glad I had mine placed and I hope you will be, too. Â Take care, Joanie",

It hurts to touch around the port itself and if I reach my arm across my chest or squish my chest in any way I get a sharp pain. I have also been awakened with it hurting - ipuprofen does help. I tolerate pain pretty well but I just didn't expect this much soreness, is this normal? Fortunately I see my oncologist tomorrow before my infusion so I will have her look at it. This will be my second round of three weekly Taxol and I am already scoping my arm for a good vein in case they can't use the port. Thanks for any advice, Joanie",

      "Content": "Jun 29, 2012 11:22AM - edited Jun 29, 2012 11:24AM by jlmacy Hi Lynn - it's your port buddy! Somehow I must have missed this post, your feelings about chemo are exactly like mine were. I, too have never felt sick, everyone tells me I \"look great\", no one can believe that I have Stage IV cancer. I was ready to give up before my last scan because in my heart I knew it would show more progression. I was wrestling with the thoughts of which was worse -dying or suffering through chemo. I didn't want to be a burden, I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to work or enjoy doing the things I love. I especially did not want to start chemo in the summer. Last summer was a wash out because of my mastectomy and susequent weeks of physical therapy. I want to tell you what happened that changed my mind, improved my attitude and got me in the right mind-set. I have been lucky to have gotten involved and friendly with a great group of people (the common denominator is the local pub). We have frequent cook outs and get togethers. There are a few of the women who have been especially kind and supportive to me with this cancer deal. Anyway, the day before my last scan, I sent them all an e-mail telling them how much I appreciated their kindness and what it meant to me. I didn't expect anything in return, but the response I got from each of them was overwhelming. Suddenly I knew my life was important, that I was loved and appreciated and I knew I couldn't give up. It was one of the greatest gifts I have been given. I don't know if this will help you get your \"glass full\" back but I hope it will somehow. You sound like you have a lot of inner strength, just keep telling that to yourself. BTW the port feel so much better today since it got tapped! You can get throught that, too! I'm not a hugger either so here's a high five!! Joanie",

After 3 months I had continued progression and had no choice but to go with chemo. I had 18 infusions of Taxol over 24 weeks (3 weeks on and 1 week off). My last one was November 2; I have had 3 scans since then and I am still stable and currently not undergoing any treatment. If I had it to do over again, I would have skipped the Tamoxifen and gone straight for the Taxol. Good luck with whatever decision you choose.
