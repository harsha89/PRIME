I found a lump but waited a long while to get it checked. I then had a mammo, US and a needle biopsy of the mass and results came back saying it was a seroma, this was back in October of 2018. Last week I saw a plastic surgeon to see about getting the mass and implants removed and he totally freaked me out saying that he didn't like the way that the mass looked and felt. I then went back to the radiologist that did my biopsy and he went ahead and did the lymph node biopsy last Wednesday the 22nd of May. I do have a strong family history. My maternal grandmother was diagnosed at 49 and died at 51.",
