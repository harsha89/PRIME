I'm a great believer and user of message boards.  But in the past they've almost always been regarding my dogs and their health.  Although I've made great friends on those boards and they are awaiting my results as well. Maybe one good thing that will come out of this will be my bf wanting to end the LD thing and realizing how much I mean to him!  Ha! Thank you again.  Is there any way on here to know where everyone is at?  To know if anyone is close to where I'm located (near Buffalo)?",

I live alone and my bf and I are in a ld relationship.  Closest family (sister) is 400 miles away so I just needed to know I'm not \"really\" alone!",
