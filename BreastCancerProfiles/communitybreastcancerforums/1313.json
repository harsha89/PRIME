She was on hormone pills which shrunk the tumor, but now it got bigger again. She also has some nodes in the underarm and neck that are affected. We saw a surgeon last week, she felt the nodes need to soften a bit before she would do surgery. They are starting her on Chemo this week. I am so scared for her. Will the Chemo damage her? I am an only child and don't have family close by. Anyone who can give some advise, I would appreciate it. Log in to post a reply",

She is starting on less powerful chemo, Tamolin I believe and then moving to the strong one that starts with an A. Can cause heart problems. It is comforting to know you have a similar journey as my Mom. I might have to work days when she has treatment. Do you need assistance as the treatments go on for an aide? I am so stressed.",
