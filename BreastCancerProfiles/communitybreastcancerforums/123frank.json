My wife who is 56 with no history of BC in her or her family was called back for a diagnostic mammo and ultrasound. She had the tests yesterday and was told by the radiologist that she needs a biopsy with fine needle aspiration. It appears that she has 2 cysts in her left breast. One is OK and the other requires the biopsy. The radiologist also told her that the troublesome cyst looked partially filled with liquid and may go away after it is aspirated. Why is the radiologist recommendingthis if it is only a cyst ? Are complex cysts different and require more diagnosis? Are they indicative of cancer or does the radiologist want to play it safe...Thanks, Very Nervous in NY. Log in to post a reply",
