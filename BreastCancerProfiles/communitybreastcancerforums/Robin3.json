My doctor said although my skin has held up  pretty well, now is when i would start to see anything go wrong. I do have a \"dark mark\" under my arm that i made him look at today. It's not breaking down or anything ...yet. He said if anything were to happen it would start to happen from now on. So I guess we are not out of the woods until we are done. I use aquaphor, aloe vera, emu oil and an aveeno cream. I try to lube up at least 3 times a day. From what I can see keeping it lubed will help but not necessarily prevent. I also have cornstarch powder for the creases for when i exercise. :-)  Halfway done with the regular treatments. I'll take it! :-)",

Period.   I ended up using a variety of products. LOL  I bought the emu oil off of Amazon (the yellow bottle with the picture of the emu on it) I used clear aloe vera gel that I got from stop and shop, i think it's called fruit of the earth. I used the aquaphor, I also used aveeno cream. I put hydrocortisone on my breast when it started to itch. (my dr said that was ok)  And I used cornstarch baby powder when working out so that the creams would stay on and it wouldn't get too aggravated. I'm happy to say that my skin held up really well. I got a dark area under my armpit. My breast got what looked like black freckles on it and it's really really tan. But as far as skin breaking down...not really..only a tiny bit at the end during the boosts.  I had 28 treatments and 8 boosts.  I was RELIGIOUS about putting some form of cream on 3+ times a day. I would put it on (the aloe vera) right in the room when i would get dressed from the radiation. I used the aquaphor at night and on the weekends. I used the emu oil all the time. I went through 2 bottles. I swear by that stuff.   I hope this helps. Good luck!",
