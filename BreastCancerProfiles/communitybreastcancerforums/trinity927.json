I've been perusing this thread for a while ... and, I have to tell you, you're a strong group of women!   I've seen it written several times that the chemo scares you more than the surgery ... I have to admit I'm definitely in agreement with that sentiment ... I'm scared out of my mind, and becoming depressed ... I had a bmx with TEs on October 3rd, and  will be starting chemo in November ... so, I'm not really part of your October group, so I hope you don't kick me out of here ... :)   But, I'm grateful to everyone who shared so much valuable information, so I know what to expect when I do start chemo in the next couple weeks ... Does anyone know if there is a November chemo thread? And, could someone please tell me the pros and cons of a port vs. IV for chemo treatments?   I'm getting conflicting info ... and, need to make a decision soon ... HUGS to ALL! Love~Peace~Joy Trinity",

I went to my chemo class yesterday ... starting chemo next Wednesday ... and, the nurse told me that I would have to give myself shots of Neupogen at home after each session ... I'm not quite sure I can give myself shots ... No one had mentioned this to me until yesterday ... after I got home, I started researching and found that Neulasta is often given instead of Neupogen ... one shot of Neulasta is needed versus many shots of Neupogen (as I understand) ... however, apparently, the Neulasta is much more expensive, and I'm not even sure if my insurance covers the costs of Neulasta ... And, I'm also confused about the side effects of each drug ... could anyone give me information about these 2 drugs (i.e. side effects, is one better than the other, the associated costs and do most insurance companies cover the cost of Neulasta?)   Any information regarding this would be much appreciated.  At this point in time, I'm having a hard time navigating through all this  ... at every turn, something \"new\" is being thrown at me!  I'm completely overwhelmed!  :( HUGS!

I just had a bmx (with TEs) on Monday, and I'm now worrying about losing my hair after just losing both my breasts ... I've been trying to read through the posts, but I'm getting a bit confused as to the best route to take ... I've also been trying to research this topic, and here's a list I've composed ... I would love to hear thoughts and/or comments ... it's truly overwhelming to me ... 1)  To promote hair growth: B vitamins, Folic Acid, Vitamin A, Vitamin C, VItamin E, Biotin 2)  Supplements that restore hair and leave it healthy: Calcium, Chromium, Potassium, Selenium, Silica, Zinc, Sulfur 3)  Nioxin Shampoo and Conditioner 4)  Hair Treatment for hair (at home): Combine 1 teaspoon of rosemary oil, lavender oil and basil oil with 1 tablespoon of burdock oil and aloe vera gel.  This is suppose to condition your hair, make it healthier and combat hair loss. 5)  Massage your scalp regularly to stimulate hair follicles. 6)  Cold Caps 7)  Monoxidil (Rogaine) Love~Peace~Joy Trinity",

I received the news I've been anxiously awaiting for yesterday ... the final path report states that all my nodes were \"negative\" ... and, my BS told me he took some \"extra\" chest wall muscle (he actually had a term for it I can't remember) because the tumor was close to my chest wall and it was  \"negative\" as well ... the tumor was 3.5 cm and very aggressive, so I feel extremely blessed that it stayed contained, and didn't spread into my lymph nodes ... very relieved ... I actually cried tears of joy ... And, it's a Stage lla ... sooo relieved to have heard that also ... :) Today I see my PS, and hopefully, I'll have the remaining 3 drains removed ... lol I'll catch up with everyone soon ... so much has happened since I left home ... :) Hope all is going well for this week's surgery gals ... keeping you in my thoughts and prayers!  Love~Peace~Joy Trinity",

I called my BS at JH and he told me that as long as I didn't have any signs of infection and that my output was to a minimum now, it wasn't necessary to have it replaced ... he just wanted me to see my primary care physician where I live today to have it looked at (which I did) ... he bandaged it and agreed that there no signs of infection and to just keep an eye on it ... so, everything is fine ... just a little painful and scary at the time ... I didn't like all those drains anyway ... now, I only have three!  Gamergirl - I'm so glad to see you on here posting again ... you've been an inspiration for so many of us ... you definitely have that fighter spirit!  You go girl! clc - Wow!  I'm so impressed that you were able to get on the computer today and give us an update, and what great news you had for us!  Woo hoo!  :) Survivor -  Hope all is well!  Please let us know how you're doing  when you're able ... sending you virtual hugs ... and, keeping you in my thoughts and prayers! For all you next week gals - please allow yourself to have some \"me\" time this weekend ... do something fun and relaxing ... I remember my son asking me if I wanted to watch a movie with him at the hotel (the night before my surgery) ... of course, I said, \"I'd love to\", so we watched \"Bridesmaids\" together ... and, the sound of him laughing was just priceless ... it touched me to the core of my being ...  It's definitely a time to be surrounded by your loved ones and share some quality time with them.   Love~Peace~Joy Trinity",

You asked questions about \"how to prepare for surgery\" ... there's a thread I used called \"shopping/packing/to-do list for surgery + recovery\" ... it's under the forum: surgery - before, during and after ... hope this helps ... it's truly overwhelming at times ... To the Garcia family - sending out healing thoughts and prayers ... I'm a strong believer in the power of prayer, and you have all of us praying for Shannon ...  Dukes_Up - thanks for asking about my drains ... I did have them removed on Wednesday ... this time I decided to let the nurse remove them, instead of my \"do-it-yourself\" version ... It wasn't painful, but a strange sensation having them removed ... I was also told to breath in and breath out, and when you breath out, the nurse pulls out the drain!  I also had a fill on the right side only ... I was a bit lopsided for a while   I've been told I have at least 2 more fills to go ... I need to catch up with all the posts, since I've been away for doctor appointments at JH ... Thinking of everyone!   I'll write more later ... Love~Peace~Joy Trinity",

      "Content": "Oct 25, 2011 04:07AM - edited Oct 25, 2011 04:11AM by trinity927 Hi to ALL! To everyone who has already had surgery and to those having surgery in the coming days and weeks, I'm sending out healing thoughts and prayers!  It's been a while since I've posted on this thread, and I haven't had a chance to read and catch up on all the new posts ... but, I've been thinking of everyone nevertheless ... HUGS TO ALL! I have received so much encouragement, support, and compassion from the BC community in the past couple months that I could not possibly repay the debt of gratitude I have accumulated; however, now it's time for me to attempt to \"pay it forward\" ... Claire (CLC) started a thread titled \"lymphedema after snb\", and she also has a recent post on this thread regarding the need to take precautions after surgery ... thank you Claire ... from my heart to yours ...  I just want to chime in with a huge ... LYMPHEDEMA ALERT!  This is for everyone that may not know about the risks of developing lymphedema (LE) after surgery.  Granted, I had heard the word \"lymphedema\", but admittedly, I didn't ask a  lot of questions regarding it or research it as I should have done.  And, what I did know about it, I simply didn't take it as seriously as I should have.  And, my doctors and nurses did not warn me, inform me, or educate me (before or after) surgery about the serious risks of developing LE after having a SNB.  So, this made me think it was relatively rare and that I had nothing to really worry about.  And, I was so focused on preparing for and getting through surgery that LE was not really on my mind at all. In any event, I was diagnosed with LE this past week, and was hospitalized for a few days.  There are certain precautionary measures you should take in order to prevent developing LE.  It's not curable and they can only treat the symptoms of LE with varying degrees of success .... my right arm is extremely swollen and painful ... it's actually so painful that it brings me to tears at times ... and, I don't want anyone else to suffer as I have if at all possible ... If I knew then what I know now, I would have done things differently and been more careful ... so, I'm pleading with everyone facing surgery and those who have already had surgery to advocate for yourself with your doctors to inform you on how to reduce the risks of developing LE after surgery ... also, do the research yourself so that you're well informed ... it seems that many doctors are not warning their patients of the potential risks as they should be ... so, please heed my warning and take it very seriously ... I now know there are many threads on this site regarding LE ... I just wish I had read all the available information that's out there before I had surgery  ... knowledge is sometimes the best defense! My doctors have now referred me to a \"lymphedema clinic\" for physical therapy and to be fitted for a compression sleeve ... and, I'm taking antibiotics due to cellulitis, that developed in conjunction with the LE ...  I'm sad, angry, disillusioned, and just want to cry ... I'm angry at my doctors for not informing me about LE ... and, I'm angry at myself for not researching everything better before surgery ... but, I'm trying my best to get past the anger part of it ...everything happens for a reason ... so, I'm now trying to turn this into something positive (it's just my way of coping with things ... finding the light in the darkness) ... and, perhaps the reason this happened to me (call it fate) is that I'm now sharing my story and experience with all you with the hope that it prevents other women from developing LE after surgery.   After all we've been through together this month, I feel like we're family, and I love and care about each and every one of you ...and, I don't want any of you to suffer unnecessarily! God bless everyone! Love~Peace~Joy Trinity",

I think he started the grieving process (thinking I wasn't going to live for long) ... but, after I explained to him that I had no plans of leaving this earthly plane anytime soon, he realized that I'm going to fight this and be here for years to come ... now, he's being very supportive ... it just really scared him that he was going to lose his mother  ... breaks my heart just thinking about what this diagnosis does to our families ... hugs to everyone!

I think I made a horrible mistake, and wanted someone's opinion as to what I can or should do ... my radiation oncologists told me that I did not need radiation therapy after surgery, although my tumor was \"close to my chest wall\", and \"vascular\" ... I am HER2 positive, and ER positive  ...  I was told that I needed chemo, herceptin, and Arimidex (for 5 years), which I'm currently taking.  However, my doctors told me that \"radiation therapy\" was not necessary.  And, I've currently been reading and researching about radiation therapy. It seems to me that I should have definitely had radiation therapy.  And, now I'm regretting that I didn't advocate for myself to receive it.  I had surgery in October 2011, so I'm assuming it's too late for me to have it done now.   Any thoughts and/or suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Hope all my sisters are doing well!  Does anyone know if GrandmaV has posted recently? Love~Peace~Joy Trinity",

I'm scheduled for surgery on October 3rd ... so, would you mind adding me to the list?  I'm having insurance issues also, so I'm hoping and praying the surgery goes forward as planned, since I'm HER2 positive, and my ki67 test results indicated an extremely aggressive cancer ...

I'm wondering if the surgery doesn't go forward on the 3rd if I should be started on chemo/herceptin before surgery?  Does anyone have any thoughts on this?  I would greatly appreciate any advice ...  I'm having a bmx with TEs (recon started at time of surgery), and DIEP surgery sometime thereafter ... As the time of my surgery approaches, I'm getting more and more anxious (and scared) ... my meltdown moments are happening more frequently ... :(    I can't seem to get to sleep tonight ... it's almost 2:30 AM, and I'm on here typing away ...

I had insurance issues hanging over my head a week prior to my surgery on the 3rd ... however, fortunately everything was finally resolved today ... you have a couple weeks prior to your surgery, so hopefully you'll get things resolved soon so that you can try to relax and take care of yourself and not have the stress of waiting for doctors to coordinate everything ... you certainly don't need the additional stress at this point ... so, I'm praying all goes well for you!  Hang in there, and please know that it's OK to vent ... I've certainly done my fair share of it ... lol ... it helps to express your feelings to women who are there for you no matter what ... it's truly been a safe haven for me  ... btw, I'm a bit confused as to why some women get the neoadjuvant chemo and some don't ... I asked my BS and he felt it wasn't necessary, even though I'm HER2 +++, and my Ki67 results are 60% ... it seems as though I should have had the chemo (and herceptin perhaps) prior to surgery, but I guess I just have to have faith in my doctors' decision .... can anyone shed some light on this topic?    I'm in the midst of a meltdown at the moment, so I apologize for rambling ... I'm just scared out of my mind ... four days and counting ... and, it's seeming all too real to me now ...  ",

I'm 3 days out from bmx with TEs ... home from the hospital ... recovery is going OK ... initial sentinel node biopsy came back \"negative\" and 2 additional nodes negative as well ... my doctors weren't expecting this outcome, since I have a very aggressive cancer (HER2, overexpresssion +3 and Ki67 at 60%) ... so, I'm being very cautious with my thinking until the final pathology report is back ... things have a way of changing at every turn (as we are all too aware of) ...  it feels as though I have 1,000 pounds sitting on my chest ... my PS told me that's how many women describe the feeling ... I think they might have overfilled the TEs a bit ... the most challenging part of this journey has been the emotional stuff that accompanies the surgery ... the first time I looked at myself in the mirror, I completely lost it ... breasts long gone ... admittedly, I've sank into a deep depression ... but, hopefully, things will start looking a little brighter down the road ...  Survivor and Gamergirl -  From my heart to yours ... a friend of mine sent me a card while I was in the hospital ... and, I wanted to share the message for both of you ... it really touched my heart ... so, this is for both of you ... \"Legends say that hummingbirds float free of time carrying our hopes for love, joy and celebration.  The hummingbird's delicate grace reminds us that life is rich, beauty is everywhere, every personal connection has meaning and that laughter is life's sweetest creation.\" We are all here for you!   We have all met each other at this crossroad in our lives, and have bonded with one another in a very special way that connects us all ... please remember you both have your sisters to lean on ...  My thoughts and prayers are with everyone! CLC - I'll be with you in spirit, along with your other surgery sisters tomorrow ... Love~Peace~Joy Trinity",
