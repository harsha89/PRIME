Once I finished radiation I started on Arimidex. I have had every side affect possible; weight gain, no energy, joint aches and pains and even shingles in my eye and head. Once I hit my bottom I was willing to try anything to re-claim my life. I found a natural supplement (that my doctor and surgeon approve) that has turned my life around. My weight has stabilized, I am sleeping 6 hours compared to the 12 this time last year. My joints don't ache. I have even started to train again for triathlons. If you have any or all of these symtoms email me and I will send you a sample. I can't tell you how much my life has turned around. I want everyone to feel as good as I do. Wishing you a healthy life full of energy and no more side affects. Jill in Denver",

If not, and you are open to a natural alternative email me or post a message and I will gladly send you a sample of a product I can't life without. I have more energy than before my surgery and feel better than my old self.",

Than I scheduled the last possible radiation of the day. After radiation I want home had dinner and want o bed. I had just started a new job so I had to keep as focussed on work as I could. Good luck, you will find what works for you.",
