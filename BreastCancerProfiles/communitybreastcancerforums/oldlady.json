I will talk to the breast surgeon at the followup regarding cosmetic recon.  He did say on Friday in my groggy post-op haze that if I needed a subsequent re-excision if the margins are still not clear, that it would be time for a mastectomy.  I was so on the fence between the lumpectomy and the mastectomy anyway but all the Tumor Board experts said I was an excellent candidate for lumpectomy so it seemed logical to go with the less-invasive procedure.  Now it seems as if I subjected myself to two unnecessary surgeries if I end up getting a mastectomy anyway. I guess I had barely adjusted to the way the lumpectomy results looked and now I have to readjust. ",

My diagnosis could be so much more serious.  Why then am I getting so upset over the stupid cosmetic stuff? I never was preoccupied with my frontal area before. I was happy I had cleavage. Obviously they served their official purpose when I nursed my 2 kids. But I never dressed to flaunt or minimize that area. They were just part of my body like any other part.  When I had my re-excision 2 days ago, I nearly had a heart attack from the image I saw in the mirror. At my 48 hour mark when I could finally take a shower today, it took me hours to bring myself look again as I didn't want to start bawling again.

Bad:  Neither a medical student nor a PA could get an IV line in successfully in either my hand or my lower arm.  They brought in the guy who does the infant and toddler veins. He had no problem in my wrist.  My arm is already turning blue.  2 mam-guided needles were used to mark the spot before I went into surgery.  I was expecting only one needle. For some reason I got a self-pity panic attack and started tearing up after the procedure when the rads were examining the films. I think it was the 3 inch needles sticking out of the site that just set me off. The wound looks huge and ugly.  They used surgical glue instead of stitches. Is that normal?  A lot more tissue is gone than I thought would be missing. I look like a delated tire. Neutral----I got to go home today which means I'm in my own bed and that is good. However, I was released when I was really groggy and really didn't feel ready.  I remember feeling annoyed like this when I had a kid in the driveby delivery era. I didn't like that at all. Really cute--My 4 y.o. niece asked my sister if the docs. had colored my skin all blue.  Apparently she overheard a conversation about the blue dye used for an SNB and she thought they were going to color on my chest.
