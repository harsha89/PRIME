What do you all take for pain?",

I too have a child and I plan to see her graduate high school in 2016! My cancer spread to the bone then to the liver and plura and lymph nodes.....I thought ok...i'm done...but NO!!  My tumor markers (CA 15-3) went from 1869 at their highest, to the lowest so far was 98.  They used to work so well for me.  They have been on the rise once again but I have to go by how I feel more than just a number.  Anyways, my last scan shows no sign of anything in my liver and everything is greatly improved.  But beware....It's only a matter of time before we come down from the high only to climb once again.  It's a helluva ride that I wish none of us had to endure, but that's how it's been for me.   I just try and \"live\" during those up times and do all I can do to be in the present cuz nobody knows how long any of us have....I look at it like I was given a gift to take the time to appreciate what's important to me...to nurture what I care about and not take \"life\" for granted!!  Best of luck to you....sending you strength and a seat belt for the ride ahead.  ((HUGS))",
