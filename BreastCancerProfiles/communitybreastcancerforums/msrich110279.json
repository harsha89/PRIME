After having a mamogram and an ultrasound (which were both negative), my second doctor said I have very dense, fiberous breasts and he recommended yearly MRIs. I had the MRI and the radiologist found an abnomality in my right breast between 12 and 1 oclock but he said he did not think it was cancerous and that I should have another MRI in 6 months. That all seemed good at first, but I'm still worried. The doctor who treated my mom initally told her that her cyst was not cancerous and then due to the agressive nature of her cancer, she died within six months. So six months seems like a long time to wait to find out if it needs to be looked into further. But I'm not sure what to do or who to talk to about getting a second opinion or reading of the MRI. I read a lot about how MRIs detect more cancers in young women than mamograms, but how MRIs also generate more false positives than mamograms. So I guess I should be happy they didn't tell me I do have cancer and I dont. But what if the radiologist was erring o the side of caution and told me he doesn't htink it's cancer when it could be. Is anyone else dealing with this? How should I go about getting a second opinion on the MRI results? Is there any other testing that can be doen or should I just wait the 6 months and see if another camparision MRI relveals anything else?  Log in to post a reply",
