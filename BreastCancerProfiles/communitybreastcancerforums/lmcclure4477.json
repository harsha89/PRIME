It is sore to the touch. It doesn't ache and only hurts when I move a certain way. If I bend over to touch my toes and stretch my arms all the way down it hurts. Doesn't ache, but feels like muscle pain. Since the pain is on my cancer side I am freaking out that the cancer spread to my bones. When I press on the spot that hurts there are bones, muscles, and joints there so I can't tell what is hurting! I also still have tissue expanders in so not sure if that is causing it. But like I said, it didn't hurt there until a month ago. It comes and goes. Usually hurts for 2-3 days and then goes away. Help! I am so scared!!! Log in to post a reply",

When I saw my breast surgeon I asked her what this was and she said it is cording and then referred me to a lymphedema physical therapist. I only saw her three times and we worked on stretching and she did massage. I had to stop because I had to have my exchange surgery. It has been two weeks and my plastic surgeon said I can resume physical therapy. Is there anything to do for cording besides stretching and massage? I want to make sure I explore all of my options. Also is your cording painful? My hurts, is tight and is causing swelling under my armpit. Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "lmcclure4477 wrote: I am a 35 year old female with a history of breast cancer in my family. My maternal grandma was diagnosed at 80 and my mother's first cousin was diagnosed at 40. Here is my story: I found a lump on my left breast at 2:00 position over a month ago. I noticed it because my daughter brushed up against me and I felt this horrible pain. I felt down and noticed a lump the size of a walnut. It seemed to come out of nowhere and was very painful. I was at the end of pumping milk and barely had any milk left. Of course I freaked out and immediately called my OB/GYN. He scheduled an ultrasound so I went and got it done immediately. After the ultrasound was over they told me the lump appeared to be normal and they wanted me to come back in 6 months. I asked what it was and they said they weren't sure but it looked like a clogged milk duct or cyst. Well this answer was not good enough for me because I had a clogged duct before and this was different. After 2 weeks of calling my dr constantly they referred me to a breast surgeon. They did an ultrasound and she said it looked normal because it was perfectly round. She said she would drain it but it wouldn't drain so she scheduled me for a needle biopsy. Went for the biopsy today and the lump didn't collapse so she said it was solid. She said she was surprised because it looked so cystic. She told me not to worry because most lumps are benign. So now the waiting game began and I am hoping the phone does not ring!! They only said they would call if the results are worrisome. My follow up appointment is January 4th. I am trying to be positive but it is so hard. I have a 6 and 2 year old and I don't want to be sick!! I guess my advice to others. Don't give up. You have to push to be seen and for answers. They assumed it was a cyst or clogged duct but it wasn't. I am praying it is a fibroadenoma. Log in to post a reply",

I have been doing stretching and going for physical therapy which has helped get rid of some of the cords but I still have one thick and painful cord in my armpit right next to my breast. Has anyone else experienced this and if so, how did you get rid of it. This pain constantly scares me because it is so close to my breast it sends on shooting pains in my armpit and breast. And then that freaks me out thinking the cancer is back. I guess I just need some reassurance. Log in to post a reply",
