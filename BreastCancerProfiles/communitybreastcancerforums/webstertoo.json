I found last week that I fell asleep in the afternoon for about 10 minutes.  I see just a little pink.  The breast was very hot after the first treatment and I saw changes around the nipple which the RO said wasn't there.  Changes still there  but no longer so warm. The only things my techs ever say to me is \"What's your birth date\" and \"Don't move\"  I've had no pain in my arm being over head but I wear a padded glove to protect the back of my hand (no fat there) and it works.  I hate the pulling and pushing, especially since they say nothing to me when they do it, except \"Don't move!\"  Off to another 15 minutes of fun.",
