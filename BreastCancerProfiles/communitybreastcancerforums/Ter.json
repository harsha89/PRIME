While prior to finally doing the kidney surgery, I had had a bad tooth ache in 2 lower teeth, ouch, and many other infections, which at the time I was put on some heavey antibiotics, I was at the point w/kidney, that if I ddidnt do something about it, id loose my kidney, so that antibiotic and me, well it was at the point all I could do was heave me guts out and of course my diarrhea, as I couldn't eat etc...so they changed antibiotic to keflex, then off to hosp...well didn't have chance to take it, as they had me on about 2 drip ones iny IV and 2 by mouth...well that's over, and now its 4AM Tuesday and im stil up, sorry for typos as I don't have my glasses on and all by myself as yesterday morning poor DH was so bad, we called the doc and he wanted him in the hosp for help, which he is there now, as a good friend of his took him, as he had packed a little bag as were not sure how long he will be there.... And now my tooth ache came back 10 fold to the point I cant even try to brush my teeth let alone move my tounge and sip water..I even used ambasol, yuck and it doesn't work, tried eating applesauce and plain white bread w/peanut butter as I know its got protein, as caloriess I don't care as past 2 wks ive dropped now more than 10 pounds, I just cant win, and ready to give up on all...and I cant even cry, as muy whole side of face and under the neck area of mouth is a B! Im calling dentist in morning if I wake up and ask if they will put me on Z pack as that's the only one that seems to work on me, not strong but it's a short regime, and it works, so I hope she does as suzie is coming here on Wed and wants me to have an appt w/dentist, and not sure if I will be ready for it..I know my body isn't, thank G*d its only down the road, and she can take me.... Just too many things going on here, and I hate to say it, but mom called today and she never calls, I call her the eveniings well I couldn't talk well and she's a sassy ole thing and she was asking all kinds of thibgs about dh and me and I really dobn ttell her everything , as I hate to worry her, but shes a mom and thinks she believes she has an MD at the end of her name lol..any way yea Im bitching as I tried to say something and it didn't come out quick enough as SOOO many things are going on here, our house is so cluttered and I don't care, and before I said a couple words she had an attitude and hung up ob me..no the phone line didn't get disconnected, as she would of called back...so after taking to my sis tonite, she said don't call her, as she upsets you too much and her age and with todays meds etc is very confusing to her, and I don't have the energy to try to explain...but she called tonite almost 9pm very late for her, and said \"well whats going on\"? dah, I let her know about Frank, and I hate it when someone \"thibkis\" they know so much more.. I then said I cant talk anymore, as I couldn't even had cared less, as yes im tryig so hard to take care of myself...I think im doing an aok job for just me......oh yea that antibiotic broke me out in a rash so bad between fingers toes legs etc, so I took a benedril..and just laying here tryig not to whollow in my own pitty. Im trying ladies but with no energy due to mouth and really weak.... I have started prayiing more, and and trying to recoop from hosp...as I have to get these piecees of sand out of my kidneym sounds easy? Nope, very hard, as drinking water is so hard and if I try to eat it causes the other end to act up , so my tush hurts...oy, what would I do without all you guys to vent on... BUT IM TRYING.. LOVE YOU ALL and your all so special to me. : ) TER",

What do you gals think? As I believe the more you know the better off you'll be...as right now I am writing my notes for another appt for Monday to see my reg internist for these lumps and pains under my arm and on my chest wall of my fist masct.....and I leave spaces between each ? for an answer, and then when i get home at some time I write them down in my doc's where I wrote the questions at, and the dr and date etc. What do you ladies think of this?

I had way too many, which was one thing, as I love cosmetics, well basically eye shadows, and my face looks great, but my body is like a dried old aligator.  Im going to try like Nivia, and other regular lotions you see on the drug store isle..No more fu fu places for me, as if I want to smell good, I'll take a shower and use the lotion/cream all over, and for a scent besides being clean, use like the Nieva, Eucerin. Im so new to this BCorg Im not sure where I would post my situation on skin cancer...also after a long battle with dr not telling me things on my BC and sending me in circles the BC spread and they ended up waiting 5 years til they did a FNA, thats when I was actually diag..when I told my doc in 99 I had a lump, and saw my doc every month due to other things like fibromyalgia. If you find something before I do, please let me know, hope I could be of a bit of help, and I also wanted to ask you those ?s re: skin cancer, as I need to go in and be biopsied on TONS of these things I have had for years, and my onc sent me to the dermatologist which is in the cancer center...but I have been so chicken I keep canceling my appts...as all I can think of is them using tiny cookie cutters and pushing them into my skin, then twisting them out...been thru so much everyone tells me, this should be easy...but Im so scarred.

But I was having infections under my R armpit, which my onc put me on antibiotic and said to do warm heat packs, 20 min on and then off, then on...NOW this infection had come back and so i just did the heat packs, which when I told him, he checked it out by feeling, and said I did right..NOW these pains under the arm again keep coming back more frequently, and the pains are getting worse...I do the heat, but w/weather is changing to hot, its mighty hot to do the heat packs, but Im doing them, as I have like the flu...just dont feel good, very tired, very cranky, bad sore throat for almost 2 months, its not real bad but its there and very uncomforable...and if I were to go to my reg doc each time I hurt or my onc I would feel like a real pest..yes i told you my onc wants to run more scans when i feel up to it...and i just don't feel like it, very run down and fatigued, stressed, and yea a cold like with congestion in chest. Been drinking lots of hot tea, and that feels soooo good going down my throat..and with my \"eating\" habits well ive been trying to eat almsot anything as the other day I was starving, and my diareahaa gets so out of control.  My mom said yeserday on phone has seen me keep loosing weight and said to eat what I can as even everything comes out, she said \"there is always \" something that stays inside, as im so weak. its 6AM now and I still havent slept yet tonite, trying to get the most of this computer before my box comes from HP to send it back for repairs..and now a good amt of computer problems are not doing what they are doing...and I know im going to be lost w/out it. if you answer to this, I'll ask Celia to check it out or Luanne if they check it out, so i can get some answers due to no comp.   as i really want some answers, and i wish someone would make them for me in Bc org land...as all i want to do is sleep.. oh yea the right arm pit hurts, and is it possible after all they took ,m to come back and grow back cancerous again? : ( thanks so much hugs Ter It's better to be effective than it is to be right.- Log in to post a reply",

Also sleeping all the time, yes the meds, and yes depression quite alot.  I just get so frustrated with so many things, as nothing that comes my way due to health, or legal or my hubby is ever good, i just feel like giving up on the whole thing....as I can stay in bed all day long especially since i have to take my pain meds, they knock me out, and then i feel guillty for doing nothing.....I feel like I dont have a life, and i do have my table out for scrapbooking...but Im so hard on myself that when I do have a bit of energy I make myself do paperwork, as I keep it accumalating..not good..like insurance, the check book and all that.  It was like day lite savings time to me tonite as dh took the comp at the side of bed and moved it in the living room, well needless to say my clock was like an hour later..and for 50 years you could call this one number at any given hour and a nice lady would say \"good morning, or afternoon or evening, at the beep the time will be ? Well about almost 2 months ago I called her to reset clocks just to make sure the house clocks were right and all she said \"im sorry, after all these years of telling you the time, we have decided to discontinue this time service\"....oh man that ticked me off...I bet anything that they will come up with a number that will show up on your phone bill of that nice time lady and charge you for it... ok nowi= im rambling.. nite and hugs Ter",
