I didn't like my breasts before, and am still going through the reconstruction process, but I am looking forward to the final results. Maybe because I didn't like my breasts before -having them removed really didn't hit me that hard emotionally?? Anywho, the expanders were very uncomfortable, and super hard. I had the exchange surgery in late September, and the silicone implants immediately felt better than the expanders. I was so relieved for that. I also had a skin sparing mastectomy, rather than a nipple sparing mastectomy. So I don't have nipples. Which is hard to wrap my head around when I look in the mirror. Once scar tissue has softened up I am going to have tattoos done, which I think will help with that mental connection. Good luck with whatever procedure you choose!",

Through all my conversations with doctors, I got the impression that if you are diagnosed before 40, that they treat it more aggressively, because you have a longer life span ahead of you where re-occurrence could happen, so they want to kill any random cancer cells that may be floating around in your body before they are able to develop into something bigger.",

I am 37, and when presented with the statistics and percentages of recurrence based on lumpectomy vs single mastectomy vs double mastectomy - I chose to go with the double mastectomy and reconstruction. I've hopefully got a lot of years ahead of me, and I wanted to do the most I could to reduce the chances of going through this again. I understand how hard this process must be for a single mom, but I do hope you decide to lean on your friends though. They may not know exactly what you are going through, but I bet they would still want to do anything they can to help.",
