(Among other more interesting activities!) I'll be thinking about you on the 10th, praying that your PET scan results are good! Lesley, Good to hear that you have at least one major surgery out of the way, and you are doing well.  I am considering the nipple tattoo also, but haven't actually made up my mind.  You'll have to let us know what you think when you have it done. Pam, My general surgeon did the tumor marker (or CA27.29) blood test after I was diagnosed, but before the mastectomy.  It was 48.4.  She was excited, because she said that it indicated that I had cancer, and if they gave it to me in the future, they could determine if the cancer came back, etc.  Well, my oncologist just groaned.....he said it is not an accurate indicator.  Sure enough, after the mastectomy, it was 50 something, and now after chemo it is 61.7. He says he feels obligated to continue to follow up once the test is done. I noticed later that on the lab slip, it says \"Assay results should not be interpreted as absolute evidence of the presence or absence of malignant disease\"! Betsy,  Thanks for the info on the tumor marker test, what your doctor says makes sense, it makes me feel better.  Hey, I did it, I went to work this week sans wig!  I was so nervous, I work in a school office, and felt like it was the first day of junior high and I was wearing something of my grandmothers or something!  (Oh my gosh, everyone is going to stare at me, make fun of me, etc., etc.) In fact some of the kids did quite a bit of staring, and I heard a couple of whispered comments (WOW, Mrs. Smith got a HAIRCUT!); but I also had a lot of people tell me that I was one of the few people they had ever seen that could pull off this look, and it looks great.  I'm not sure if they meant it or were just being nice, but it meant me feel better.  Linda ",

I found that a heating pad, and Capsacin cream helped. I have also scheduled an appt. for Acupuncture for the day following the chemo.  Has anyone out there tried it?  Funny how all of our side effects seem to vary, but the losing of the hair time-line seems to be pretty much the same for us all!

So today I had to go for another Pet Scan, and tomorrow it's a CT scan. I had some very small nodules in my lung in Jan., but both the surgeon and the oncologist thought they were nothing.  (Maybe scar tissue). Now they want to take another look at those, but wouldn't the chemo have taken care of it if it was cancer? I asked the onc that question, and he thought it should've too. He said he hates the tumor marker test, and never orders it, but because the surgeon had it done, he feels obligated to follow up on it.  Titan, I can relate to how you are feeling!  Sometimes I feel like just living my life and forgetting all of these tests!  As far as the pre-menopausal mammograms goes, I have always had very dense, large breasts, and even post-menopausal they always told me it was almost impossible to see anything in the mammogram........it always looked almost solid white.  But.....my cancer was found with a mammogram, so I am grateful for the technology too.  (So much for forgetting about all of these tests!)  My mom died of the exact same breast cancer that I have, and I am so thanful for how much medicine has advanced since then.  Hey, I do have some good news, my hair is moving right along, ALMOST able to go hat-free, no bald spots left.  My eyelashes are growing in too, though they are short, stubby, and growing in every-which-way!  I decided I had better check my arm pits, since I have gotten so used to not having to shave, and I found ONE super long hair....YIKES, guess I better keep an eye on that.

(Exactly how they will do that, I don't know!)  I was thinking about your story about leaving your key in your door........ tonight I went over to my daughter's house to take care of her dog while she is gone.  We live in a small town, and I am the school secretary, so know every kid in town, and most of the parents.  Well, I went with just a baseball cap on, and took that off when I was in her house.  She has one of those dead bolt locks that is really difficult to turn, you have to jiggle the key, make sure it is all the way in, etc.  So....here I am standing out on the porch, finally get the key to lock the door, and when I turn to leave, I realize I left my hat in her house!

Unfortunately I didn't save the paperwork, but it seems like it said that Latisse could darken eye color in brown eyes..... Mine are green, and I haven't seen any change.  Anyway, as far as results, my eyelashes are definitely longer than they have ever been, but I have lost some of them, and they are thinner.  I don't think if you stopped using it, your eyelashes would fall out again, I think they would just go back to their original length and thickness. I paid $236.00 for two packages at my plastic surgeon's office.  So far, it doesn't seem like I'm going to run out of the first bottle for awhile.........I'll just switch to an eyeliner brush if I run out of brushes. Just like I thought it was worth spending $$ for a wig, I thought it was worth a try to hang onto my eyelashes!  If they all fall out, I'll just quit using the Latisse, and use it when they start growing back in. Just my 2 cents worth!         Linda",

I'm wondering if the onc will go ahead with it? AmylsStrong, I also thought losing  hair to chemo would just mean bald!  I agree that this fuzzy head thing is much uglier....(If that is possible!)  I had thought about shaving it, but I hate to do anything more drastic, so guess I will just stick with the hats and wig. I love how everyone tells you that your hair will come in much thicker, a different color,it will grow back before you know it, etc., etc..  I'm sure it's just like being pregnant.  That nine months just flies right by when it is someone else!",

For those of you suffering with mouth sores,  I have had canker sores off and on my whole life.  I found some treatments that were helpful for me:  Mix equal amounts of Milk of Magnesia and Liquid Benadryl.  Swish 1 tsp. in your mouth for one minute and spit out.  Repeat every 4-6 hours.  If you have a couple of sores, you can dab with equal parts of water & peroxide, then follow it with Milk of Magnesia. I heard using wet black tea bags could help too. Hope everyone is SE free!  Three down, one more to go! Linda",

(I was lucky to make it through a full day of work and get a simple dinner cooked, that was ALL I have been able to do for months.) Now maybe I can do something enjoyable each day instead! Helen, I am so sorry that this is your second trip through this valley.  I have often said that if I get cancer again, I'm not sure I'll be able to face treatment a second time. That is the worst thing about this awful disease.......you can never be sure you are cured or that it won't re-occur. I take my hat off (well, maybe I shouldn't do that just yet!) to you.  Hope you have many sunny days this summer in Toronto to brighten your mood a lbit. Nadine, where in Idaho do you live?  I have family in Boise, Coeur d' Alene, and my dad just moved from Kooskia.  If it weren't for safety, I'd say ride the motorcycle without the helmet.  If the breeze feels that good blowing through your hair, just think of how good it would feel against your bare skin. Although I do wear a wig and hats,  I sport the bald look whenever possible! Linda",

I have not had the BRCA2 test.  Originally the pathologist said I was a candidate for genetic testing, but nothing has been said about it since. Lesley, How long do you have to wait after chemo to have your surgery?  I had a mastectomy with a tissue expander in Feb. at Renown.  I have to wait 6 weeks after chemo to have the tissue expander replaced with an implant (and reduction & lift on other side.) That will mean probably the end of July.  I finished chemo June 11th.  Hallelujah!!  How frequent are you chemo treatments? It sounds like you are doing a lot of travelling for treatment too.  At least now the weather is good so you don't have to worry about driving to Truckee in the snow & ice! We've driven 2,000 miles for treatment since Feb.  Maybe we could get together for lunch sometime...... Linda",

My last chemo was June 11, so it has taken awhile. Like Titan, my husband thinks my semi-bald head is sexy too. I am getting more and more brave about going without a hat or wig.  School starts on Monday, and I decided today to go down and get my office organized.  I decided to skip the head covering, and there were three teachers there organizing their classrooms.  I think they were kind of taken aback, but they were very gracious.  I have no bald spots left, my hair is pretty thick, but looks like a number 2 butch, and is salt & pepper.  (I have always colored it auburn.)  Anybody else still waiting on eyelashes and eyebrows??  I love the way the eyebrows are coming in especially thick where I need to pluck them! Titan, It has to be nerve wracking going through the whole biopsy, etc. thing all over again.  I'm praying that it will be benign.  I'm sure they are just being especially cautious because of your history. I think I need to go find my DH and take advantage of the increase in libido; Oh yeah, AFTER the wine and chocolate of course!",

As far as the Zometa goes, he didn't suggest it; I was just curious about it, because I know that it is used for Osteoporosis.  Because I have Osteopenia, I am concerned about the bone loss that is caused by AI's. My onc just suggested that I get a bone scan, and we keep an eye on any bone loss that may occur. I hope your SE's are finally starting to go away.  My last tx was 6/11, and it took about a month before I started feeling decent.  My sense of taste and smell is finally getting back to normal; this AM in the shower I realized that if I put the bar of soap right up to my nose, I could actually smell it! The muscle weakness in my legs is going away, and my Taxotere \"cankles\" almost resemble ankles again. I'm thinking by the time school starts on 8/24, I might be able to wear shoes again. (Flip Flops aren't exactly proper office attire!) To all........On the hair front; I will be so glad to get rid of the hats and wig.  I go \"topless\" at home, and in front of family and close friends, but put on a hat or my wig when I go out. I was so looking forward to my hair getting long enough to be able to go out with out a hat, but, after reading some of the posts on here, I am now paranoid that I will look like a dike when my hair gets to flat top or butch length!  Will it help to wear lots of make up and jewelry?? (LOL)  My sister says just make sure you don't go anywhere in a flannel shirt and jeans! I am refusing to check on my eyelashes on a regular basis.  I am reminded of the expression that \"A watched pot never boils\".  Sooo, if I don't look, maybe I'll wake up some morning with thick, black, long, eyelashes.  Chelev, I also tried the false eyelashes, and I wasn't sure whether to cry or laugh. I can't remember who it was that is having the tissue expander/implant exchange on the 10th, but hope it goes well for you....I had mine on July 22nd, and it went great.  Only took 3 pain pills (1/2 dose).  So, I wish you the same.  It feels so amazing to have soft breasts again, after the hard as a rock tissue expander! Hope we can all continue to keep in touch with our progress even after chemo.",

Dawn, so glad your surgery went well, and you're doing good in spite of the fainting spell. I am a fainter too, don't you hate it?  At least you were in the car where you couldn't fall, and with your husband.  I tend to keel over someplace very public, and crack my head or something equally dramatic.  It's so embarrassing!  Are they really going to let you take off the bra already?  I have to wear mine for six weeks, day and night.  Maybe it is more for the \"lift\" side than the implant.  Isn't it nice to have soft breasts again though? By the way, is that a wig or your \"pre\" hair?? I am so jealous everytime I see your pic & Chelev's too! Ah, to have thick DARK hair! Helen, I am going to be starting on Arimidex too.  I am just waiting for the results of my blood test before I start, and I am dreading it. Hopefully we will both do well, and not have SE's.  Isn't it amazing what total strangers will say??  One day I went to a thrift shop only wearing a hat, and a lady said to me, \"So, how are you feeling?\" She then went on to tell me about her friend who just finished chemo, etc.  I thought it was kind of nervy to just assume that I was having chemo. What if I had something else that caused me to lose my hair?  I've learned through the years to never assume anything, and (hopefully!) to think before I say anything.  By the way, what is DIEP? Titan,  You're right, it is funny the way we are willing to show our breasts to each other.  I NEVER would have done that before!  I think part of it is because we feel such comraderie (sp??) with each other, and I for one don't even feel like my breasts are really quite part of me anymore. Betsy,  Good luck with the rads..glad the first appt. went well!
