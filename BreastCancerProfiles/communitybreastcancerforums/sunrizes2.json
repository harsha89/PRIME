At least I know mine is not so bad.  I just don't 'get him' yet.  I.E., yesterday when I went for treatment I passed him in the hall and he said \"hi, how are ya?\"  I said in a whisper because thats all of the voice I had at the time (my voice come and goes all the time and I never know from one minute to the next if I'll even have a voice) anyway, I said \"Can you please look into this voice situation  and let me know what's going on with it when I see you in two weeks?\"  Now here is the frustrating part for me.  I inquired about this at least 6 months ago when it started to come and go and he said \"Gee, I don't know\" and said it each of the next 3 times I inquired.  So yesterday he said \"Oh, its the Avastin\"  I said, \"really?  is it?\" He said \"yes\" and then went into some scientific explanation about swelling of the esophageal ?***&^%$$ of which I didn't understand at all.  I just 'got it' that it is common and he's not worried.  BUT, my point is, he never followed up and told me prior to yesterday.

Plus even if there was another onc in the area I think they have to have special approval for these clinical trials.   But the example you gave is what I am taking about, he just kinda blows it off when I talk about problems with se's.  Like you I've learned so much from these boards, and have so much gratitude for you girls and the knowledge and experience you share.  Hopefully I'll be able to help some too.

Also, do you understand how radiation works?  How does it help with pain? What exactly does radiation do? I assumed it killed cancer cells but then it much kill good cells too so what does it do to the bone and surrounding area?  Like I said, I am scared, worried and its helpful to talk to someone who has been thru it.  Thanks a bunch Hugs & blessings , Linda",

Thanks in advance.  Just a little about me..Stage IV now with mets to bone (cervical and thoracic spine, ribs, clavical, hips) just had CAT and new areas in pelvic area.  I have severe pain in right hip/waist area and my Onc is sending me for MRI Friday.  He mentioned radiation which I have never had before.  I have been on Avastin and Arimidex for a year now plus Zometa.  I take Arimidex every night, Avastin every other week and Zometa every three months.  I am scared and worried about radiation. What can I expect as far as side effects?  Also, what does radiation do?  It must kill something but what?  I really need some input from you girls who know so much more than I.  Oh yeah, I also have a hard time with pain meds - haven't met one that didn't make me so nauseus it wasn't worth it - tried morphine last Friday and it didn't help the pain at all but did make me sick.  Thanks for your help Lots of hugs!!! lil ole me Dx 11/7/2007, ILC, 3cm, Stage IV, 0/25 nodes, mets, ER+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I still don't 'get' how radiation helps pain but I'm learning.  My CAT showed two new areas - both in the pelvic region.  MRI Friday and then I have to wait a week and a half to talk to Onc for results and whether or not he wants me to have rads.  Thanks again, Linda",
