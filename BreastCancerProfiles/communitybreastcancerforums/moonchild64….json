The technicians took a long piece of medical tape and lifted my breast up so the fold underneath was exposed, then taped it diagnonally across to the arm brace.    I do not know the particulars of why this worked, but it does.  Not sure if this is standard practice or not, but thought I'd share and possibly help others avoid some of the radiation SEs.

The nipple area was extra sensitive from the tape going over it and as the treatments continued, it did hurt to pull the tape off ~ I did not notice any 'protection' from the tape as far as tanning/burning... FYI -  Aloe Vera worked great for me. As far as other SEs, I did experience some fatigue the last few weeks, but tried to take a brisk walk at least 10-15 minutes after treatment as I was told that this would help with energy.  I am a single mom and being a couch potato is just not an option",

I was recently laid off from my job and really started noticing more pain after that - wondering if stress is a contributing factor and caused the flare up?
