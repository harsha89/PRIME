Did they just not see it because of where its located (i cant even feel a lump), also i was referred to a breast surgeon that i wont see for two more weeks, I did a little research on the internet and some of the things i found that seem to go along with my findings from the CC are NOT good also just some things i have been experiencing like recent (last 8 months or so)tingling of the nipple in my right breast which i thought was from the reduction ,, Im scared to death because I have heard so many stories of women that their doctors have told ohhh its no big deal we'll watch it ,,then 2-3 years later they find out they have stage 3 4 or 5 , I have been having mamos every year since the age of 33 (im now 41)without ANY question even after my reduction not even a \"blip\" It was reccomened by my GP due to not knowing my history because of being adopted ,, where do i go from here and should i been worried ????",
