So you may have better google searches with FEC. I am 4 1/3 years into Stage IV Palliative Care treatment, and have done continuous chemo with short 10 day breaks for palliative radiation. The last chemo I was on was CMF and I did 3 cycles of that before being switched to FEC. I have had cycle 1 (infusion 1 & 2) then a 2 week break, now yesterday, infusion 1 of cycle 2.My tumor markers were in the 700's before cycle 1 but went up to 845 after. The ONC said he expected to have to do at least 2 cycles before they plateau or drop. So we'll see. I hope this works because he said I only have 2 treatment options left before we have to look at clinical trials or stopping treatment. The side effects I have had so far are loss of hair after cycle 1, infusion 1. That seemed very fast! Major fatigue. Like I want to sleep two to three times per day, 1-2 hour naps. Plus early to bed, late to rise. And of course, the neutropenia was severe after both rounds, my WBC went to 400 (ANC .4) and I had to be careful of exposure to infections. How are you doing now? Have you had any cystitis with the Cytoxan? The Epirubicin causes red urine for 2-3 voids, but the Cytoxan can cause cystitis. I had my first UTI (since my 20's!) after infusion 1. It was very painful, but they showed it infectious and not cycstitis. They gave me 7 days of Bactrum, but since I'm still struggling with lingering post-void pain, they gave me another 14 days of it. Every infusion, I have to have an extra 2 Liters of Normal Saline to help prevent the cystitis. Now they worry about fluid overload. I can't win! I have no appetite and when I do eat, I can only eat small portions without feeling full. I feel bloated all the time, but have had that before even the CMF. I have occasional feet neuropathy, but not constant. Thank the Lord, I am a baby about my feet since I had hand-foot syndrome in 2014 with Xeloda. I also have other s/e but expect that to be from the cancer rather than the medication. I hope you toloreate it better than I have. Keep me posted. I don't know anyone else on FEC. I will look up CEF and see if I have any better luck. I think they list it as FEC because that's the order of infusion where I am treated. Hang in there! Shelley ",

It was the lung symptoms (shortness of breath, cough, pain) that interfered with my daily life, and brought me to doctor. The good news is that chemo reduced the tumor burden in my lungs and eliminated pleural effusion (water around lungs) twice in this last year and a half. I am now on hormone therapy, and hoping it will keep the cancer at bay. Just a word to the wise, do not be fooled into thinking that your lung cancer cells ever completely go away or are in \"remission\". When people say that what they actually mean is the lung tumors/cells have been reduced to where they are no longer visible on a scan. (CT/PET). Regardless, having them reduced provides a better quality of life & extends life. Keep up the faith and keep learning everything you can. Peace!",

I have mets to various areas of my pelvic girdle, and several vertebrae. The first caused severe sciatic pain down my whole leg. I was treated with radiation, 10 times, to the L4-5 area and that ended the pain. A year or so later, had 10 treatments aimed at left I.S. And that fixed that pain. Only had a small amount of skin sensitivity. I would do the radiation again, to avoid being dependent on pain meds. I also have OA and the MO doc encourages Naproxen for that. Hope you are well.",

But I now have a tiny piece of bone sticking up through the gum and the gum is pink, not red. The skin hasn't pulled over and healed it shut. Now, the last two days it has decided to swell up and start causing toothache type pain, all the way to my ear. It hurts so much. I have Chlorahexadine swish and spit but I hate using it because the mint taste burns my tongue/mouth. (I have been using kids strawberry toothpaste for three years now because of chemo mouth.) Do any of you have any further recommendations to help relieve the pain and/or treatment? I'd much appreciate any advice. I'm also alternating hot packs/cold packs. Help! Thank you. Shelley",
