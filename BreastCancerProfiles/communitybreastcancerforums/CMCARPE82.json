      "Content": "Apr 12, 2018 07:43PM - edited Apr 12, 2018 07:44PM by CMCARPE82 I've pretty well had the same experience with my radiologist she wouldn't even look at the screen when the tech kept trying to show her several things that had them concerned and then they had some computer decipher my results so who knows? I definitely feel for you, and sitting and waiting for them to decide to do anything that will give any definitive answers is nerve racking. sending thoughts and prayers your way, and even though I don't have any wisdom to offer you, I'm hoping your doctor can get things figured out for you soon! Hang in there and fight for your health, gut instincts usually aren't wrong.",

I hope they figure out what is actually going on be sure to keep us all posted :) as far as my stuff goes watchful waiting for 6 months unless the results of my genetic tests tell my surgeon he needs to do something sooner, but the genetics testing at the breast center couldn't get me in until mid may so just continuing to play the waiting game and still trying to decipher my ultrasouund results because I really feel like somethings not right and it's the only information i have so far. I will continue to keep checking on you and I really do hope for the best seems like too much stuff going on with you not to be related in some way.",
