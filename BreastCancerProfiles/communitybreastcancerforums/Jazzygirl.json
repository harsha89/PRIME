Mine was 23 and got the same advice, risk to benefit would not help me and chemo would have been over treating my case. I was 52 when I was diagnosed and my docs said you likely will live another 30 years so we like to do chemo when we think you really need it (certain types for sure get it like HER2 positive, node positive pathology). I had something like a 2-3% reduction with chemo. I had very similar pathology to you from the info you did share on your byline. You are young and not sure if you have had children yet, but chemo can change things with fertility so best to get some advice from that direction too before you decide (maybe you have already.......) You may want to ask your MO if no chemo then what? My guess is after rads, you are going to be put on tamoxifen (usually for pre-menopausal women vs. the AIs for post) for either five or ten years. That helps to keep the reoccurrence risk down. Decisions with no clear cut guidelines make it so hard. Once you gather all the facts, I suggest to do a pros and cons of doing chemo vs. not doing it (side by side comparison). I had to make some similar decisions related to what type of rads I would do and this was what really helped me do it. The list that is longer usually is the winnner. PM me if you want to talk more. Happy to help! ",

      "Content": "Sep 17, 2016 12:24PM Jazzygirl wrote: Hello friends- Sassy asked me to post something about BCO and why this site is an important resource to women, especially for you that are recently diagnosed, but for some of us who are a bit down the road on this stuff. So here we go. I was diagnosed in the fall of 2012, had lumpectomies and internal radiation. By the spring of 2013, I was through the majority of treatment and started the aromatase inhibitor medications that often follow on for those of us who are estrogen positive with our tumors. That was also a good six month adjustment due to side effects to those medications. It took a long time to really feel better from everything, and that is to not discourage you, but so you can be patient with yourself not only as you go through treatment but during the recovery process. It is okay to let folks know you won't be bouncing back like you had the flu or something. And yes, some people do seem to expect that. I will share some interesting parallels between two things I have gone through in life; the experience around a major loss of a family member and related grief process, and then when I got my cancer dx (and a whole lot of other bad things as mentioned previously). What I have noticed there seems to be a general time table on things like grief or recovery from cancer treatment by others, and have always found that to be very odd. I have never been one who appreciates being told how to feel about things by others or for how long. At age 32 (I am now 56), I had an older brother who became ill with a rare lung disease and whom passed at age 40. We were very close and it turned my world upside down, along with the rest of the family. It took me a long time (maybe the rest of my 30's) to really heal from that loss. With time and grief counseling, I found my way through and even to live life a bit more purposefully. There were comments during this period about that loss, getting on with things, over it, etc. I learned then that people were not interested in dealing with my pain for very long. With time, many of them were in similar situations with the loss of someone they cared about and later commented how they never understood what I was going through until it happened to them. Sometimes people just cannot relate, get scared, or just lack of empathy for others suffering. Most people mean well, but many people are able to understand all we go through. With cancer treatment, I felt a lot of the same thing, except instead of it just being an emotional wound, there were the physical ones too. We end up with physical and emotional scars, some which the world will never see but that we live with. Never mind the longer term SEs from the treatments we go through. Recovering from cancer treatment takes years, it has for me. We are not the same after, just as you are not after the loss of a loved one; we are forever changed, lives take on a different focus. But yet, there is a time table that seems to show up in these situations too. And again, I think that is odd. The reason many of us came here to BCO is that it initially met a need each of us had for support during diagnosis and treatment. And for those of us that remain, it continues to meet a longer term need as we work our way into a new normal. We have a community here that is a resource for women both short term and long term. We like to help our sisters who are newly diagnosed in the ways many here helped us, to be with those living with cancer through their Stage IV diagnosis, and sometimes to just talk about things that matter to us. We are here because this is a place that provides us support without a time table. Coming here is so refreshing to me in a world that is filled with \"aren't you done with that yet?\" There are so many great threads here for each stage you go through from the tests right after diagnosis, through treatment decisions, how to deal with the relationships around you, questions around insurance and financing cancer treatment and more. There are also places where people don't talk about cancer, but have a place to talk about other things. Gardening threads, quilting threads, animal threads, and more. So take a look around and find what helps you most. Many of us are on some threads for awhile during treatment, other places we stay for the longer term. I like to let folks know when I need to leave or will be gone for awhile for any reason. We worry about each other here, like to check in on each other to make sure folks are doing okay. Our friend Sassy is a great one for making sure we are all doing okay! We are sorry you find yourself here, but you have also landed in a great spot for much support during difficult times. We wish you the best on your journey through treatment and back to wellness.",

In working on the HRC campaign and weekly phone bank, I hear many things. The first week I was doing voting, I spoke to a woman who had end stage pancreatic cancer. She could not hear me well, and gave the phone to her husband for me to speak with him. He explained the situation to me. I told him I was sorry to bother them and he said \"I want you to know that if my wife makes it to November, she will be voting\" and then he thanked me for helping the campaign.

I hope you can get some relief and also be able to be present for your DD to have this wonderful summer together. Cancer is yellow bands, pink ribbons, and the like for most people. Unless you have have it, have had it, or helped someone who has had it, there is no way to describe this to anyone and make them get it. I talked to a friend who has Stage IV brain cancer yesterday about where he is at. I spoke to his daughter before hand, so I knew what was going into before I called. I am trying to do something to help the family to make things a bit easier for them, and during my time with his DD, she broke down on the phone tears with me. Then my friend called me and said he wants me to come over this week. I have been prepared about what I will see when I go. But I am going because that is what we do. I wished I were closer to you so I could come for a visit as well. Here is one of my favorite blooms from the cactus this year Rose. To me, it symbolizes the light and shadow that life is filled with. Wishing you better days friend and more light. ",

You continue to sound good and valuing each and very moment of every day. I am trying to do the same. Stories from the neighborhood today, I am always reminded that every person we meet has a story. I saw this man in a motorized wheelchair with the cutest little girl about a year old on his lap down the street. Something about this just warmed my heart, so I approached him to say hello and found out he is a neighbor up the street. He was taking a cruise with his granddaughter. I said nothing about the wheelchair, but he volunteered he is waiting for a liver transplant. It touched my heart because I had a brother who was waiting for a lung transplant and did not make it. I told him I knew about the process from a relative who had been waiting for something similar. Sounds like he got out to Phoenix for an almost surgery, but then it did not happen. He told me he always sees me out front working on my gardens (which you all know I love) and how nice they are. Anyways, I wanted to share this story because I am often reminded everyone has something going on and extending a little loving kindness can make a person's day. So many of you do that every day on this thread for our dear Rosevalley!",
