How many more lives do we have to lose, How many mothers, fathers, sisters, cousins, daughters, sons, friends, neighbors  and coworkers do we have to watch die!!!  Our voices have to be heard!!! No more pink we all should show up at the pink rallies wearing black to honor all the lives that have been lost and show everyone that this is what cancer truly is not pretty and pink get our message out there let them know we demand a cure!   United we can win a true cure for breast cancer!  Let's join forces and fight breast cancer toget Dx 5/2015, Right, Stage IV, ER+/PR+, HER2- (FISH) Log in to post a reply",

They will die from breast cancer!   Who will become  one of the over 30% that will develop metastatic cancer no on knows! And initially  6-7% start of as metastatic cancer right from the start  so that is close to 37% will succumb to breast cancer. Over 44,000 lives are lost every year just in the USA.  We need more transparency of where the money we raise is going.   We want to know what percentage goes for administration cost?What are these administrative cost? What are the salaries of the CEO's of these organizations?    It is time to unite and take a stand and demand a true cure. How many more mothers, daughters, friends, fathers, sons, coworkers... Do we have to watch die!   We are not disposable.  If we stand together are numbers are to great to ignore we have to make a statement and let the world know we want to live and we want more money to go directly for a true cure! After all of the money that is collected and is divided up after all the administrative costs... How is the money that is to go to the caused divided up.   I know that actually  only 2% of that money goes to metastatic breast cancer . Remember over 30% of breast cancer will become metastatic cancer and  Metastatic breast cancer will take your life. I am not trying to frighten anyone I am trying to make you aware.  This is truly the facts this is awareness .  I think we should all throw out the pink. Cancer is not pink and pretty they have commercialized breast cancer.   We should wear all black all day in honor of all the mothers, daughter's, grandmothers, sisters, fathers, sons, aunts, uncles, friends, neighbors and coworkers who have lost there lives while we wait for a cure  wear black to all day on October 13th in support of metastatic breast cancer.  Wear black to the pink rallies let's turn the pink to black to bring awareness .  The organizations want it to be a happy day a pink day but truly is it ? Now that we know the facts and that over 30% of the people at the rallies will develop stage IV metastatic cancer. We must use our large numbers to bring awareness to a true cure. So someday hopefully in the near future no one will die from breast cancer Dx 5/2015, Right, Stage IV, ER+/PR+, HER2- (FISH) Log in to post a reply",

Then I had bone biopsy which then changed the diagnosis to stage iv breast cancer and now the masectomy is not an option I was told by a major cancer hospital in NYC.  Surgeon and oncologist they see no benefit.   I want a masectomy and I dont know what to do if no one will do it.  I have researched the topic and I feel that getting rid of the tumor burden and radiation to the breast/chest followed by systemic therapy would give me a better chance. I should be able to have options and make decisions.  I want to go aggressive. Anyone know of a doctor who is treating his patients agressively Dx 5/2015, Right, Stage IV, ER+/PR+, HER2- (FISH) Log in to post a reply",
