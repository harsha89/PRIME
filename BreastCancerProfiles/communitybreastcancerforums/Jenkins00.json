On the pill for 10 years until I got pregnant with my son. This was pure luck as I got pregnant right after I stopped taking the pill. I could never get pregnant after, my cycle was just so messed up, even tried AI. Only to discover I had endometriosis which resulted in a hysterectomy with only my right ovary remaining. On top of this I was dealing with nipple discharge on and off for 18 years that was a result from a microadema on my pituitary gland. Test after test it felt like for female issues. Now, BC.
