Re: follow up care - I had a bone scan (due to Arimidex), mammo/ultrasound, pap smear, ultrasound of ovaries and colonoscopy. The pap and colonoscopy were overdue procedures that doctors had cancelled when I was in treatment.  Onc does not do scans or blood marker testing due to false results.  He said if I have a particular pain or issue we can do a scan at that point but he also doesn't want me to be exposed to any additional radiation unless it's a real need.  He told me he wants me to separate out my GYN and breast surgeon appts to become 6 months apart.  That way, even if I only see each once a year I will have had two clinical exams by medical personnel each year.

ETA:  BTW, it was  my GYN who found my tumor and it was located pretty deep so must be something to the fact that some doctors are better at locating these things. ",

Just recently finished treatment on Jan 31 and put on Arimidex around Valentine's Day and will be hitting my one year mark for dx on Apr 5.  I figured, okay now onto millions of tests, scans, etc.  Not so much.  My onc said that scans aren't as definitive for breast cancer and it comes with it's own negatives just from the stuff injected into your veins and the radiation from the test, etc.  He said we will do marker tests but even they come with false negatives/positives.  I'll be followed by my oncological breast surgeon, in consonance with my GYN and oncologist all together but mostly the surgeon/GYN using mammography, ultrasound or an MRI if needed. Basically the oncologist said we get to the point where one can live ones life doing nothing but being tested, scanned and waiting for results.  I also feel so much more comfortable with the surgeon being involved because I view oncologists more as report oriented people that pretty much are experts that interpret pathology/blood issues and from there determine and administer treatment while the surgeon and GYN tend to be more involved and hands on during testing.  ",

Even now that treatment is over, one thing that is so important is we still meet and do things together but they are ever respectful of the fact that I may have to call it a night early due to being tired, or I may hurt from Arimidex.  This is the best revenge I can get from this disease - not to allow it to keep me down and as I said, I'm \"this\" close to stage IV.   A PET scan before I began treatment showed no other traces of disease after surgery.  I just completed treatment and in 2 weeks begin the tests that will tell me if it all \"worked\" since mine was also an extremely aggressive tumor. ",

My treatment was high dose density 4 A/C, 4T and then 35 radiation treatments completed January 31. I was given a two week rest before beginning Arimidex hormonal therapy.

I purchased LTC insurance eight years ago at age 50 because I live in a high cost area and I am single.  I originally had checked on it for my father and found the cost of nursing home care in our area is about $65-$70,000 per year for a type place one would consider placing a loved one.  Also, LTC insurance is like any other type insurance - you pick and choose your plan to what you can afford.  I know that in my policy, I have to be evaluated by two doctors who say that my ADLs are such that I can no longer live or be left alone and from that point on there is a 90 day waiting period before I can go to a facility.   The younger you are when you purchase this insurance, the cheaper it is.  A cadillac type plan where one has no waiting period etc are pretty costly so its like most insurance, you will have to choose to the level you can afford to pay. Ironically tho I looked into all this for my father, one year ago this month I got my dx - stage III extremely aggressive breast cancer. ",
