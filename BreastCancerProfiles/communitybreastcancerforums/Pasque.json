I had a appointment for Friday for the Kadcyla, but some one canceled so I got it today. So I will talk to you in a few days and let you know how I feel. Thank you for your help.

I am one that doesn't want to take anything more then I have to but I have had to take a pain pill some so I can stay up. The legs, back and shoulder are the worst. Some days it is not too bad. But the fatigue is adding up. I assume it is also just getting use to the medicine. But it is better then being sick for a week and a half on the other stuff. Will be nice to find out if it is working. I do need to add a protein drink. Anyone who uses them, is one better then the other? Guess I will watch it snow for a while.

Hope it doesn't happen much. And thanks for the suggestion of powdered milk in milk, really does add the protein. I did receive a cook book from the company that makes Kadcyla. It has chapters on day of chemo, neutropenia, diarrhea,constipation, sore mouth, high calorie, high protein, snacks an meals and a couple others. It has recipes and shopping list. It is a nice book and easy recipes. I just signed up at their site and it was free. Kinda nice to have. It is called Eating Well through Cancer. Hope every one is having a good day.",

I thought about raising the dose but haven't yet. I haven't had any stomach problems so far. Nice to be able to taste food again. I do get a bit constipated for 3-4 days after treatment but easy to eat for it so hasn't been a big problem. Over all this isn't bad. Hope everyone is doing well and able to accomplish something. Feels so good to be able to do something. Thanks for listening, nice to have people who understand.",

Dr. talked about a pet scan and I go back for treatment the 26th. Dr. will be gone and I will see a NP that I have only seen once but she had really research my case and seemed to know a lot about me. It has scared me. Had high hopes for this drug and it may not mean a lot. Will see but was wondering if anyone had the tumor markers go up on this. Been on it since Dec. I hope the numbers drop down this week. Please send prayers for me. I will keep you all in mine. Thanks for being here. People really don't understand and it is hard to talk about with them.",
