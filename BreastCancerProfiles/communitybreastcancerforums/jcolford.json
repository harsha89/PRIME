Mostly was during a hot bath and rarely did I see it on my bra. I would ask for a MRI and or ultrasound. If you have dense breast tissue a tumor may not show with a mammo. Mine didn't but it did show on the ultrasound. The lump was visible through the skin but did not show on the mammo. Better to have it checked out and be not cancer than to wait and it be too far gone. Best of luck Jo anne",
