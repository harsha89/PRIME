(my original one in 08 I had 2, US and core needle biopsy but all was fine)  I got my call back and wasn't worried, had the ultrasound and when the radiologist came in (another dear family friend, I could see his face and I knew it wasn't good)  He said, I am only going to US the left breast today, the right one has some microcalcifications that don't present in a benign way.  UGH, that was the beginning.  I had the sterostatic biopsy (or whatever it is called) and the result is DCIS grade 3, ER+, HER2 not back yet.  I underwent a MRI today to see if that is all we are dealing with.  I had blood drawn for the BRAC annalysis on friday but we are waiting to see if the insurance will pay for it.  My mom died of ovarian cancer 9 years ago.  I don't really know which way I'm leaning for surgery, but the closest radiation center is 45 miles away (and not the hospital that is doing my sugery that is 80 miles away) and if I have surgery in October 4-6 weeks of healing that puts me right in the middle of winter to drive, and close to the holidays when finished.  UGH, not to mention we only have 1 car so I'd have to get up at the crack of dawn to bring my dh to work then have to find a sitter for my 6 year old that I homeschool.  I hate that my choice may come down to convience.........  Of coarse all this may be mute if there is something else on the MRI or the BRAC test comes back positive.  Thanks for reading this far.  I feel like I'm talking in circles and have no idea what I'm saying. ~ Dawn Dx 9/13/2010, DCIS, 1cm, Stage 0, Grade 3, 0/3 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I do have 4 drains though so that makes a little difference, I'm not sure how many someone with TE would get. Good luck with your upcoming surgery, soon it will be behind you and you can concentrate on the next phase of your journey in life.",

LOL Thanks for the compliment on her name too Cathi, she was adopted from China so we mixed the east and west with Emma and Li (which means beautiful and we certainly think she is) to get EmmaLi. (and yes it is still pronounced Emily) I guess if your daughter doesn't call RAC back they will just show up on their door step to take the stuff back, if it's the little guy's bedroom furniture that won't sit soo well with CPS for them to make him sleep on the floor because he has no bed...but then again painting the car is sooo much more important than food or payments on something they rented.  SIGH  how frustrating.",
