I was thinking the two findings completely conflicted with one another, but it makes sense that you could have several different things going on in one tumor. Thank you! I was diagnosed in October with DCIS non-invasive, intermediate grade, necrosis, ER/PR POS. Post surgery path report indicates high grade, but the surgeon never mentioned that to me when I saw him at the 1-week follow-up appointment post surgery. I just happened to notice that tidbit when I was going over my report this past weekend. It kind of startled me. I am assuming it is still considered non-invasive, but I am starting to wonder if he left any other important particulars out of our discussion. I should have been better prepared to ask him more questions. I just had my surgery at the end of October. My surgeon was very good about explaining the DCIS diagnosis and my options for surgery, but he didn't go over my biopsy pathology report with a fine-tooth comb. He highlighted the portions that were pertinent to what his approach would be (and my options) for surgery, such as the grade and the benefits/potential side effects of performing a sentinel node dissection. The surgeon really didn't discuss too many of the details contained in my post surgery path report, however, I was provided a copy. He did explain the \"highlights\" of the report, i.e., the nodes tested negative (2) and the margins were clear. I was referred to a medical pathologist, who I will see tomorrow. I certainly like the idea of a nurse navigator. I have tried to read as much as possible, but sometimes I think I am doing myself a disservice because there are so many variable involved. This is the first time that I have ever joined an online discussion and I am so pleased that I did. Thanks again for your help and your perspective. I hope that you are both doing well at this stage of your recovery. With much appreciation, ktl7",
