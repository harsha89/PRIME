We found out that the tumor in her brain did not shrink from the previous radiation only getting bigger. More metastatic tumors in her lungs and now there is metasis in her liver. She currently just went through a radiotherapy surgery that will hopefully shrink the tumor on her brain and relieve some of the swelling that is there. They are treating her with high doses of steriods. Dr's say that there could be long term side effects with her being off balance and this effecting her eyesight from all the pressure of the tumor. What frustrates me is that I can't get one dr in the hospital who is an oncologist to give me a direct answer about what her quality of life is. Surgery is not an option on the lungs or liver.. THey are just focusing on the brain mets.  Dr's say it could take up to 2 months to tell if the radiotherapy did any good. So frustrated....",

She has had bouts of radiation and chemo and can no longer have any more. She is very unstable when she walks and has to hold on to walls or people, because she refuses to use a walker or wheelchair.  My mom has always been a very independent and active person. It's very hard for me to see her this weak .. She has always taken care of me and now I want to take care of her, but she is trying to distance herself away from me and everyone else. I don't know what the future holds, but I just want to spend as much time with her as possible. Log in to post a reply",
