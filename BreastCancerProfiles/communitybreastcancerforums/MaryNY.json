I too was diagnosed with a rare disorder. In my case it was idiopathic transverse myelitis and I was diagnosed after I suddenly became paralyzed to the waist over the course of two hours one bright September morning in 2008. I was fortunate to be diagnosed and treated quickly but was still recovering from that when I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I know what it's like to go to doctors who have never heard of transverse myelitis (tm). It was a factor in deciding on what type of chemo to do and each time I saw an oncologist, I had to educate them on the disease. There is no awareness of transverse myelitis and little to no research. Yet it can be a debilitating disorder which leaves one-third of patients as paraplegic and another one-third are left with permanent, life-changing disabilities. Even if one is in the \"lucky\" one-third that recover, most are left with some residual side effects. Although I was shocked when I was diagnosed with breast cancer, at least I was dealing with a disease that didn't require any explanation beyond those words, there are lots of sources of information, support, ongoing research. There are statistics to help in making decisions about surgery and treatment based on one's specific diagnosis. It was much easier than dealing with tm. Even if it involves pink ribbons in October, I do think awareness is a good thing. And yes, it's a marketing ploy too but I don't think we can do much about that.",

I wanted to avoid the taxanes because I have reason to believe that I would be high risk for neuorpathy. My onc agreed with me and suggested AC. I knew about the cardiac risks with Adriamycin and was concerned when my MUGA score came back very low \u2014 41%. Onc sent me to a cardiologist who did an echo and said my heart was healthy and I was fine to proceed. I never saw the results of the echo. I completed four dose-dense treatments of AC in December and am now half-way through CMF. I was given the Adriamycin as a push and the Cytoxan via drip. I did not know there was the option to give the Adriamycin as a drip. I think the push typically took about 20 minutes. Would it be given much more slowly via drip?",

The cost will depend on the insurance company and the type of biopsy procedure. A core-needle biopsy will be the least expensive. A stereotactic would be more expensive and I'm guessing that an MRI-guided biopsy would be more expensive again. There is also an incisional biopsy. The insurance company website might list the cost. I know it sounds awful having to possibly fork out $2,000 for this. But I think your peace of mind is worth this. ",

BS asked me to have MRI just in case there was anything else. She said always best to know as much as possible prior to surgery. I was devastated when the MRI reported four additional suspicious masses. One was right beside the confirmed tumor and so similar in description (spiculated) that they figured high likelihood of malignancy and termed it a \"satellite lesion.\" BS ordered biopsies of the other three suspicious areas. At that time she discussed mastectomy with me. But then the biopsies came back negative. So as far as the MRI is concerned, the cancer is confined to the twin lesions in the upper outer quadrant of my left breast. I now realize that MRIs can give false positives but they can probably give false negatives too. Did you have an MRI prior to surgery or did the two tumors show up on a mammo or ultrasound? My confirmed tumor and the twin (probable tumor) are very close together -- just 1.5 cm between their centers according to the MRI. Maybe yours were further apart? Apparently two or more tumors in the same quadrant is termed multifocal so in some cases I suppose they could be quite far apart so a lumpectomy might not be feasible.",

So I've decided on a mastectomy with reconst both for aesthetic reasons and, more importantly, for peace of mind.  BS said that with a mast, the chance of recurrence would be 1%, whereas with a lumpectomy it would be about 10%.

The lab told me typically 10-14 calendar days and tests run over weekends too, but they said it's usually faster. But I'm not sure if that time is from when they receive inital faxed request from doctor or from when they receive the tissue sample which would be a day or two later. 3-4 months from Dx to treatment! My bad mammo and u/s was almost five months ago. My Dx by biopsy was four months ago so my time is running out. I seemed to have been dogged by delayed tests and waits for appts all the way.",

She also did a breast exam. She then passed me on to the head technician who set up the appt for the mapping/planning. That second visit was the longest and was about a week later. That was the most difficult as I had to lie still for so long. You might want to call the office to confirm the appt. That way you can ask how long to allow for the appt. I find it takes a lot of stress out of the situation when you have more of an idea what to expect. I have heard of someone who was charged a copay for every radiation visit but I think that's unusual. I had just started rads in late Feb when my insurance provider changed. The first insurance company covered radiation treatment 100% but with my current provider they pay 90% until I've reached my deductible, then they pay any balance at 100%. I still haven't been billed. I think most places bill by the month. When you go for your appt on Wed, you could ask them to check for you or your could call your insurance company directly.",

However, when I presented it to the wig supplier, she said she would need the correct diagnostic code. I think this refers to the ICD-9-CM diagnosis code. I called the doctors office and they gave me the code 174.2, but this is one of the codes for breast cancer. It's acutally for BC in the upper inner quadrant, whereas mine is in the upper outer quadrant (174.4). But I'm guessing this is not enough for the insurance company to know that a wig is medically necessary as there are many breast cancer patients who do not have chemotherapy and thus do not lose their hair. I think the correct code should be one of the codes for alopecia (704.00-704.09), but which one? Do any of you have a copy of your wig prescription that you could check for this information?

Cathy: To add a photo to your reply, you need to post your photos online first (outside of bc.org) and then link to that. There are lots of sites where you can create a free account -- www.flickr.com, www.photobucket.com are a couple of options. For speed in uploading, you might want to reduce your photo size first. Once you have a photo hosted on one of those sites, right-click the photo and copy the URL (in photobucket use the direct link), then click the picture link (tree icon) in your message, paste the URL ... that's pretty much it. Preview your picture and if you think it's too big, right click, go to image properties and halve the dimensions.",

So I suppose every onc is different in how they monitor their patients. The two I've been checked for are Cancer Antigen 125 (CA 125) and Cancer Antigen 15-3 (CA 15-3). CA-125 is primarily used to monitor therapy during treatment for ovarian cancer. CA-125 is also used to detect whether cancer has come back after treatment is complete. Series of CA-125 tests that show rising or falling concentrations are often more useful than a single result. This test is sometimes used to test and monitor high-risk women who have a family history of ovarian cancer but who do not yet have the disease. CA 15-3 is not sensitive or specific enough to be considered useful as a tool for cancer screening. Its main use is to monitor a person's response to breast cancer treatment and to watch for breast cancer recurrence. CA 15-3 is sometimes ordered to give a doctor a general sense of how much cancer may be present (the tumor burden). CA 15-3 can only be used as a marker if the cancer is producing elevated amounts of it, so this test will not be useful for all breast cancer patients. ",

What I don't understand is why they don't need a code for hair loss instead. Because the wig is needed as a result of the hair loss which is not caused directly by the breast cancer but rather is a side-effect of the chemotherapy used to treat the cancer.  ",

The two oncologists I've seen so far both recommended Taxotere as part of the mix -- one suggested TC*6, the other suggested AC*4 then T*4. I'm going to get a third opinion this week. I really don't want to take Taxotere if there's an alternative because of the incidence of neuropathy as a side-effect. I've also read that there is some controversy over its effectiveness in ER+ women.  I managed to get on Adjuvant! Online and see that the two combos suggested to me aren't the only possible 3rd gen combos. MarieK -- I don't know about coffee but I know that green tea is known to have anticancer effects. I usually drink black tea with milk but I've switched to green tea. It won't do me any harm and it might do me some good.

Mel: My doc didn't give me any specifics about arm exercises after SNB but I figured anything that helped increase the range of motion in my arms would be good. Use your good arm as a guide to see what your goal is. Best one for me was standing facing a wall, placing my hands flat against the wall, then walking up the wall with my hands. I put stickies on the wall showing how far I could go with each hand, could see a slight improvement every day and by three weeks had the same extension with both arms. You can do some exercises while seated at your desk or watching TV, just try raising your hands over you head and moving them up/down, forward/back, etc. Don't force yourself beyond the pain point. I didn't experience any swelling after the SNB. I would ask the BS or nurse about that.  Marie: I think you'll really enjoy the LGFB workshop.

Oncotype DX is a is a diagnostic test that quantifies the likelihood of disease recurrence in women with early-stage breast cancer and assesses the likely benefit from certain types of chemotherapy.

She said it appears to be fairly early/ fairly small. Radiologist did mention I have some calcifications in other breast, which could, but probably will not be malignant. If they are malignant, that would indicate a more advanced case. Trying to get app with Dr. Swistel in NYC. I am interested in the combination lump/reduction. They say if you are very large it can reduce side effects of radiation. I have major shoulder problems, and have been considering a reduction for years. MRI tomorrow, I am supposed to go to a wedding on the west coast on Thursday. Even more awkward, I am supposed to go on a three day long job interview in Texas next week. I have no idea what to say or do about that. A few more fun facts, we are this week dealing with bed bugs, hubby can't go to MRI because that's when the exterminator is coming. It's almost funny. I'm going to ask a few more q's because of the posting limits. Treatment is normally at the same hospital as the surgeon...should that be a factor in picking the surgeon? I had a terrible experience at my initial mammo, and want to make sure I am not someplace awful for radiation/possible chemo. I live very near Sloan Kettering. Do people find the radiation/chemo experience to be better there? How about Cornell? Any other NYC suggestions? Support group in NYC for husbands? Mine is younger, 38, and we just got married last year. So far he is great, but his peers have moms who have this, not wives.",

Everyone's tips and personal accounts have been so helpful. I had been through all the possible scenarios in my mind, with the result that the event itself was much less daunting. While I was being hydrated at the beginning, the nurse sat down and educated me on the whole process and side effects. But I could have slept through that. I arrived at the center at 9:30AM and was out of there by 12:30PM. Haven't had any really nausea so far, just a bad headache, the type that makes you feel sickly to your stomach. But that could have been due to the fries that I unwisely had with my lunch. Took a Tylenol last night for the headache and slept like a baby. Today I go back for the Neulasta shot. Juanelle, I'll take your advice and take a Claritin. Had some brekkie, must take my Decadron and Emend now. I filled the Rx for Zofran but haven't felt that I needed it yet. Bought one of those squeezy bottle (intended for hair color) at Sally's but it's not working very well to wash down my nether regions. I've been using wet wipes but not sure they are as effective. Onty, what you said about infection and colonoscopy makes perfect sense. Will wait if onc doesn't force the issue. Binney, great advice on the bracelets. I ordered a free one from lymphedema.com. When I got my Smart Port installed on Tuesday, they gave me a wrist band and key fob. I wore the wristband yesterday but took it off last night as it looks so conspicuous (which is probabyly the point). Just wondering if others wear them all the time, in case they're rushed off to ER? I find it hard to remember to keep drinking. I usually drink a lot of water but not so much when weather is cooler. How much fluid should we get a day while on chemo?",

If those of us in the US go the cold cap route, we are prob not going to have the support of nurses or doctors on that decision. While one is in the chemo room, I'm guessing you need someone to come and change the caps and unless you bring a helper, the nurses here likely won't see it as their job to help. It seems that in the UK, the Macmillan nurses encourage the use of cold caps. I'm really surprised that recommended treatment vary so much between the US and UK. You said earlier that you were on FEC and I figured that would be a viable alternative to what the first two oncs recommded in my case. So I read up on epirubicin vs. doxirubicin (Adriamycin) and find that in some studies epirubicin doesn't show as much cardiac toxicity as doxirubicin. But then I find that in the US, epirubicin costs 22 times more than doxirubicin, so insurance companies won't cover its use. The higher cost has something to do with the patents on the drugs and generic versions being available, I think. I'm going to ask the onc about it today and see what she says. I'm guessing the more widespread use of Taxotere vs. Taxol may be cost-related too. What a world, where cost dictates the treatment we get. When I started on my breast cancer journey, I was headed down the road to a mastectomy with immediate reconstruction with DIEP flap based on the advice of the first surgeon I saw. Then I spoke to a breast surgeon in Ireland who advised me that was far too drastic. I saw two more breast surgeons here in the US who agreed that a lumpectomy was a better option in my case. There is a tendency here to do mastectomies where lumpectomies would do. The mastectomies seem to be an easy sell when accompanied by the promise of perky new reconstructed breasts. Yes, we are too US-centric on here. There are just more American members than others so that's going to be reflected in the threads. Anyway, Virginia, please don't go away. I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say we really like your perspective, your sense of humour and your warmth to everyone new who joins the group.",

Her recommendation was different to the other two. She said I should definitely avoid the drug Taxotere that the other two had recommended because of my medical history, as it can lead to neuropathy in up to 50% of patients. She said with my history of transverse myelitis, I might be more susceptible and she said she really didn't want to take a chance esp since there are other choices. Her recommendation is either (1) FEC*6 or (2) CAF*6. Her preference is FEC as epirubicin has less cardiac toxicity than Adriamycin. However, although epirubicin is widely used in Europe, it's not widely used in the United States because it's more expensive here so I'm wondering if my insurance company would approve it. If not, I'll go with Option 2. Next step is to have a MUGA test to see it's OK see how my heart would get along with the anthracyclines. She's also going to order the Oncotype DX. I thougth I wasn't a candidate for that test since I'm node positive. This will take about a week so will delay my chemo start date. I'm going back to see this doc the week after next by which time she should have the results of the two tests.",

Saw two oncs with different recommendations. Going to see a third one next Thursday. In the meantime, I went to a Look Good Feel Better event at my local hospital. I really did feel better after this as amongst the group of ten women were some who were already near the end of chemo and they all looked great. Some were wearing wigs which I would never have guessed when I walked into the room. The event included discussions and demonstrations on hair coverings, wigs, skincare and makeup. There were a number of useful handouts and everyone left with a bag filled with a really nice selection of skincare and cosmetic items. I would encourage any of you who has one of these events near you to take advantage of it. I was nervous about going and they started the event with a short video which really made me well up and although there were teary moments after that too, it was just great to meet others going through a similar experience.

In your case, wouldn't fiber help also? It would slow things down and also hold fluid so the stools would be bulkier and softer. Have you tried going bratty? BRATTY is an acronym for bananas, rice, applesauce, toast, tea and yogurt. These foods, especially when eaten together, can help to firm bowel movements. In the past, physicians recommended the BRAT diet only, which did not include tea and yogurt, but the BRATTY diet is now preferred given the beneficial qualities in yogurt.  About yogurt, on those days where I found it hard to eat, I tried Dan-Active. It comes in a nice small container and you can drink it down in a couple of gulps. It's a bit sweet for my taste, but it has those good bacteria which can be used to restore the intestinal flora.",

My last treatment will be this day week. I've been bothered by terrible night sweats during chemo. They usually wake me up three or four times a night. One thing I have to say about being bald, it's nice when the night sweats come. I usually wear a thin cotton cap to bed but throw it off when I get the night sweats. Anyone know if these will stop when I finish chemo or are they a menopausal symptom? I'm 53 but was still having regular periods prior to this but they stopped after 3-4 weeks of chemo. Sometimes I get hot during the day but not bathed in sweat like I do at night. Not sure if these would be termed hot flashes or not.

It was just what I needed psychologically yesterday. One thing they mentioned was that it's better to have your hair cut short rather than shaving your head. For starters shaving you head is so drastic. And your hair will likely continue to grow into a stubble which will be uncomfortable. They gave out a flyer of places to get wigs and I hadn't realized there were so many nearby. You do need an Rx from your doc for a \"cranial hair prosthesis.\"  The American Cancer Society can also provide wigs for free, but I'm guessing the choice is pretty limited. I asked one of the two oncologists about Cold Caps and he just said \"they don't work\" in a way that didn't allow for any further discussion. A nurse at the local Cancer Care said she has never heard of them working either. If there is that much resistance to using them by nurses, I'm not sure I'd want to rock the boat. Don't you have to go in there with a cooler full of caps for each session and then maybe need a nurse's help to change them as you are hooked up to an IV and can't move around much? About the yeast infection. I was wondering would eating yoghurt with live cultures help? Or maybe taking probiotics? That might help restore the intestinal flora. MN-Jeanne -- I wish I had a garden. I think gardening is so therapeutic esp at a time like this. You can watch the plants grow as you move through this stage and by the time they are blooming, hopefully you will be too!",

I know Nioxin is expensive, how much would it be for the three-piece set normally? I found a product called Fine Solutions by Bain de Terre at TJMaxx. It's a three-pice set of shampoo, scalp treatment and conditioner, the packaging says \"starter kit for advanced signes of thinning hair.\" Has anyone else tried this product? I see it's a discontinued item, wondering why. For the moment, I'm just using Johnson's Baby Shampoo.",

They might fit you in if you do that rather then register online. Also is there are a few different locations locally, some may be better then others. I went to two -- the first one was excellent, great volunteers, lovely presentations. Then I went to a second one just to get a wig. That one was very low key and poorly attended. I didn't wait for the makeup demo as I'd already availed of that. The first location also had a follow-up class \"Spa Night and Eyebrow Clinic.\" At this one they demonstrated and gave out eyebrow kits. I went through most of chemo with eyebrows intact. Then they fell out suddenly two weeks before the end of chemo, so the kit came in very handy. Yes, I finished chemo on Feb 1. I did find chemo very rough. The bad taste in my mouth continued for a while and the fatigue. The fatigue got worse during rads, which I finished last week. My hair started to sprout even before I finished chemo. I posted a couple of photos last week. They are be a couple of pages back on this thread (p 163). I had been coloring my hair for years so no idea how much white/gray I had. Initially my hair came in all white. Now there are some dark hairs peeping through. My hair is very fine and it's about 1\" long now but lies flat against my head so at a glance, I think I still look bald. I'm a bit shy still about going wigless or hatless yet. Good luck tomorrow. Great that you will be halfway then. So you should be finished by the end of May?",

Now that I looked at the first pic again, I see a dark area up high on the left. What color was your hair prior to chemo? Maybe it just takes a while for the color to take off and it does it unevenly. When my hair first fell out, I was left with some dark hair along the edge of the scalp near the front. It was as if that somehow escaped the chemo drugs. The rest of my head was more or less bald. So maybe different parts of the scalp have different growth cycles or recover more quickly from the chemo drugs. I'm guessing your hair will even out with time. But I'm sure you are impatient to go topless. Michelle: Yes, it may be the herceptin. There was also the fact that my chemo regimen was AC*4 followed by CMF*4. A lot of people don't even lose hair on CMF. I had already lost it with the AC, but it started to grow back very quickly after I finished the CMF.",

For those of you that are still undergoing chemo, please take a photo of your hairless head for your own use. It is very encouraging to be able to see progress week by week. I wish I had taken a picture of myself in my bald state and also in the first few weeks after chemo as the stubble started to emerge. I'm still not sure whether to color my hair. If I used some kind of non-permanent color on top of the gray, would it produce a two-tone effect? If I do color I'd prefer to use some kind of ash blonde color.

I had been coloring my hair for years, but usually paid a lot of attention to the top and the area around the temples and not much to the back. Even with a mirror I never noticed any white roots there. So I was kind of surprised that it came back so white. I was also surprised at how curly it is. But my onc nurse said that for many of her patients, the hair comes back curly but does eventually return to its original texture. The quality of my hair seems much better now than it was pre-chemo. Maybe because I'm not putting color in it. You would likely have to wait a while before putting in color anyway, as most women seem to report unexpected results when they color too soon. So that way you can see if you (and your husband) like the new you. It's certainly a lot simpler to not color. ",

Have you a Wholefoods in your area? They usually sell a wide range of essential oils and rosemary is a common one that you will find there or in a good health food store. If you don't find almond oil in the supermarket, you will find that in Wholefoods too. Almond oil is usually sold in a bigger bottle than the essential oils as it's often used as a carrier oil. Castile soap is available at Wholefoods and Trader Joe. I found this recipe at Natural Beauty (check there for other shampoo recipes): Hair Loss Castile Shampoo Recipe (great for thinning hair and hair loss) Ingredients 6 oz Liquid Castile Soap 5 Drops Rosemary Essential Oil 3 Drops Tea Tree Essential Oil Directions Mix together all the ingredients.

I did have a few colorless hairs sprouting up on my scalp even before the end of chemo, then it really took off for a few weeks but now seems to have slowed down. The top of my head is not as fully covered in as I'd like. The rate at which the pubic hair sprouted is impressive and it's so dark. Unfortunately the hair on my head is still very white-grey with just a few dark hairs springkled in. Hoping this will change.",

Some people shave their hair off soon after starting chemo to re-empt the fall, but I didn't have the courage to do that. I think it's important too to pick out a wig while you still have all your hair. The wig seller can help you choose one that is close to your own color and style. Emotionally, it will be easier for you to do this before you start chemo. You don't have to buy yet, just choose a wig and have them put it aside. Your insurance may cover part or the entire cost of the wig but you do need to get a prescription from the oncologist for a \"head prosthesis.\" Oh, if you can find one nearby, go to a Look Good Feel Better session. They will help you with wig choices, scarf tying, etc. Follow the link and input your zipcode to find a session near you. I went before I started chemo but many of the women there were already half way through chemo and when I walked in I had no idea that some of them were wearing wigs. They looked great. It took some of the fear out of it for me.",

A couple of months in, I did try Fancifull in a the lightest shades -- Bashful Blonde and White Minx. But I really couldn't see any difference in color, although it did leave a residue on my hair making it very stiff. But maybe it was too soon to color. If I didn't throw out the bottles I might try it again.  This is my hairytale from last spring: <snip> I finished chemo on 2 Feb 2010, so the first photo was taken at eight weeks and the last one four and a half months PFC. By August I was like an old lady with a really bad perm and I trimmed it for the first time.

First because the hair is so short, a lot of the color may get on the scalp and be absorbed through the skin. Second, because the chemo drugs are still in the hair shaft, they interact with the dye causing unexpected colors. I think one of the main complaints is brown colors coming out with a reddish tinge. Since you used black that shouldn't have been an issue. I'm curious about your screenname -- is it Scot's Gaelic?

You can always go and choose a wig and have them put it aside for you until you are ready. I cut my hair short before it fell out but didn't shave it.

It's expensive, one person said she paid $400 plus tip to have it done. Consider safety issues too -- on the official website they say: \"There have been no clinical tests performed on the safety of performing the Brazilian Blowout on pregnant women or women who are breastfeeding. As a result, we do advise against pregnant or breastfeeding women receiving the Brazilian Blowout treatment.\" On one of the blogs devoted to the process, a few users mentioned that they had eye irritation both during their salon visits and a couple of days afterward. There is also uncertainty among some users whether the product contains formaldehyde or glutaraldehyde. Even low levels of exposure to formaldehye can cause runny nose, sore throat, headache, itching, rash and irritated eyes. It is also a known carcinogen. Glutaraldehyde has similar effects. The company who market the products does not admit to them contained either formaldehyde or glutaraldehyde but apparently they do not make the ingredient list public so who's to say for sure what the active ingredient is. See the Allure article from Oct 2007 \u2014 Scared Straight. What I've read in a few minutes online persuades me that even if I could afford it, I would not want to risk using this process.",

There are of sites where you can create a free account -- www.flickr.com, www.photobucket.com are a couple of options. For speed in uploading, you might want to reduce your photo size first. Once you have a photo saved on one of those sites, right-click the photo and copy the URL (in photobucket use the direct link), then click the picture link (tree icon) in your message, paste the URL ... that's pretty much it. Preview your picture and if you think it's too big, right click, go to image properties and halve the dimensions. Emegram: your hair looks great. How I wish I had that amount of color.

They advised us not to shave our heads at the Look Good Feel Better class. I think the reasons were twofold, psychologically it would be hard to take and possibility that still growing hairs would become trapped in the hair follicles causing irritation. Once my hair started to fall out, on Day 16 of chemo, it came out very quickly. It would just sort of rub off my head in the shower. I see you've made the plunge and already shaved. That's a giant step (in my book anyway). I was crying even as I trimmed mine. I think we all find the hair loss very traumatic, but once it's gone it's kind of liberating. It certainly saves time in the morning. As for scalp care, I just used a couple of drops of Johnsons Baby Shampoo when showering. I think some people might used lotion but the couple of times I tried that it just felt sticky. I didn't have any irritation but always went wigless and hatless around the house. Still do. ",

She said they would only remove it in the office if it was a PICC line. So because of my insurance, I'm opting to have it removed in the next few weeks. I go for a port flush on Friday and the nurse will also draw blood for the port removal. Do they make two incisions to remove the port -- one at the port site and one at the end of the catheter where it feeds into the veing in the neck? Does the surgeon typically make the port incision on top of the original one or make another one there. My port scar is very noticeable, much more so than my lumpectomy scar. ",

I figured that's like our journey here where the efforts of those who've gone before help those of us who come later. Anyway, I only met one person. I turned a corner and there he was... a solitary snowman. He was sporting some acorn buttons, a stick nose and acorn eyes. He also had a few feathery seed heads on the top of the head but remembering how I felt this time last year with my bald head, I felt I could help out in that department. I scrambled around and found more seedeheads and added to his hair covering. Then, in honor of all us!, I added some eyebrows and eyelashes.

Has anyone here have any experience of that? I'm wondering if it's something I could do myself. ",

Then posted to Photobucket (or you could use Flickr/Facebook) and copied from there. And no, my hair is not styled in the last one, I just trimmed a little around the ears myself. That's just the way it grew. I didn't have to do anything with it at that stage, just wash and go. It became very unruly after that. ",

In modern Irish (widely used 1960s onwards) the \"h\" is used to indicate the accent (buailte) over a consonant. So prior to that \"Chan go foill\"  would be written as \"Ċan go fóill.\" Some of the letterforms would have been quite different too. The word \"Ċan\" is foreign to my ears, though it seems to be used in Ulster Irish.  ",

I really think it's wise to exercise caution when taking supplements.  Ladies, please don't overdo the supplements without checking with your doctor. In the US and Canada, many foods are fortified with folic acid, so it's unlikely that you would be deficient if you are eating a well-balanced diet. The reason mandatory fortification was introduced was to help address the incidene of NTDs (neural tube defects) such as spina bifida in children. If you take a supplement along with your fortified orange juice and fortified cereal/bread in the morning, you may be already getting too much before you even head out the door. This is an abstract from a scholarly article in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition in 2004 \"An overwhelming body of evidence for a protective effect of periconceptional folic acid supplementation against neural tube defects (NTDs) led to mandatory folic acid fortification in the United States. The effectiveness of folic acid fortification in improving folate status has already been shown to be quite striking, with a dramatic increase in blood measurements of folate in the United States. Preliminary reports also suggest a significant reduction (≈15-50%) in NTDs in the United States. The success of folic acid fortification in improving folate status and in reducing NTD rates is truly a public health triumph and provides a paradigm of collaboration between science and public health policy. Although folic acid is generally regarded as safe, there continues to be concern that folic acid fortification may have adverse effects in subpopulation groups not originally targeted for fortification. In this regard, an emerging body of evidence suggests that folic acid supplementation may enhance the development and progression of already existing, undiagnosed premalignant and malignant lesions. Over the past few years, the US population has been exposed to a significant increase in folate intake, for which essentially no data on safety exist. The potential cancer-promoting effect of folic acid supplementation needs to be considered in carefully monitoring the long-term effect of folic acid fortification on the vast majority of the US population, who are not at risk of NTDs.\"  I know it's an earlier study. More recent studies are not entirely conclusive, but some countries (e.g., Ireland, Norway) have decided to err on the side of caution rather than introduce mandatory supplementation with folic acid. ",

I'm glad to hear that you have no issues on Tamoxifen. I'm not ready to read about the SEs of that yet. How did the rads go? Did your Oncotype report show the degree of ER and PR expression? My pathology report listed them both as highly expressed without giving a number, but the Oncotype report shows: ER Score = 8.7 (where >6.5 is positive) PR Score = 7.9 (where >5.5 is positve) So whereas they are both positive they are not as strongly positive as suggested by the path report.

In the beginning I thought that based on diagnosis, the path ahead would be clearly defined and I wouldn't really have to make any decisions. How wrong I was. There were delayed tests, confusing test results, differing medical opinions all along the way. Today I'm faced with yet another fork in the road and coming here for advice. I was diagnosed with IDC in May. I had a lumpectomy in August. Tumor was 1.8cm, Stage IIa, Grade 2, 1/6 nodes, ER+, PR+, HER2-. I'm 53 and pre-menopausal. In the normal course of events, next step would be chemo, followed by radiation then hormonal therapy. I went to see three oncologists. I informed all three that I was diagnosed a year ago with an autoimmune disorder, transverse myelitis. I have recovered almost completely but am left with some residual numbness on the right side, which might suggest I would be more susceptible to neuropathy, which is a common side effect of the taxanes. The first onc suggested TC*6. The second onc suggested AC*4, then T*4. The third onc said she would avoid the taxanes. She put it bluntly saying she didn't want to see me come back in six months in a wheelchair. She suggested CAF or FEC. First she ordered three tests: MUGA scan, CYP2D6 and Oncotype DX. My MUGA score was low normal (51%), CYP2D6 showed IM (intermediate metabolizer) and Oncotype Score is 18. With an Oncotype Recurrence Score of 18, I think that means that the recurrence percentage is 12%. Or maybe that is just for node-negative women? The Oncotype report refers to the SWOG 8814 study and the accompanying graph showed almost no benefit of using CAF-T over using Tamoxifen alone when the patient had 1-3 postive nodes and had a recurrence score of 18. But the study only involved 367 patients and they were post-menopausal (whereas I'm pre-menopausal). I'm not aware of any other studies that look at Oncotype and recurrence in node-positve women. So the options suggested by the oncologist are: (1) CAF or FEC, but there is no guarantee of benefit, while I would suffer all the SEs. I'm concerned about cardiac toxicity. She would try to get insurance to cover FEC, as she said epirubicin has less cardiac toxicity than Adriamycin. (2) Skip chemo, do radiation followed by Tamoxifen for five years. The CYP tests shows I can metabolize Tamoxifen (3) Skip chemo, do rads followed by both Tamoxifen and Zoladex (goserelin). She said that Zoladex would put me straight into menopause and enhance the effect of the Tamoxifen. I asked about using the CMF regimen but she dismissed that idea. I didn't follow up with her reasoning on that. I'm in a dither. Should I have chemo or not?

If it was indeed a newly formed tumor in the breast which was either not there or two small to see eight months earlier, how the heck did it get to the point where it sent troops to the lymph node and that had time to grow to 0.7cm in that short time? That's pea-sized. Another troubling thing is that the tumor in the node did not show up in CT scan or PET scan or breast MRI. All three declared the axilla area to be disease free.",

You can Chillows on Amazon, probably at a lot of other online stores too. They do get mixed reviews on Amazon, some glowing reviews and others say it's a waste of money. If used as instructed without storing it in the fridge, I don't think it would be as effective. In the meantime, you could make the rice-filled pillow. Mine is made from a black-nylon knee high and there's probably two pounds of rice inside. You could go fancier and make a nice silk sleeve for it. Then it would be nice to rest it over your eyes too. When you get up in the morning don't forget to put the rice-pillow in the freezer so it will be ready for next time. To cover your eyes, there are also gel-filled eye masks.  Another trick I use. Run a facecloth (American washcloth?) under cold water and wring it out. Fold it a couple of times and lay it across your forehead or eyes. Keep a bowl/plate by the bed and drop it on that when it's done its job.  EDITED TO ADD: Some days links just won't work for me here on BCO.

The discoloration on the skin surface is gradually fading, but there is still a large, hard mass underneath that doesn't seem to have gotten any smaller. It's about 3 inches in diameter and oddly it's centered in the upper outer quadrant whereas the worst discoloration was in the lower outer quadrant. I suppose that's where most of the blood leaked due to gravity. That area is still purple whereas the rest has graduated through shades of yellow and green. This is my healthy breast but I would like if it had healed up more before surgery in case the PS wants to do a little nip at that to make it more symmetrical with the reconstruction that will be done on the other side. I don't have any pain from the hematoma and the breast temp seems normal so I don't think there is an infection. At least I'm lucky that this happened to the good breast rather than the one with the tumors or it would probably have complicated surgery and pathology. Leaf and Jule: did you massage the hematoma by using a rubbing motion or was it more like compression?",

Are they using it for both node-negative and node-positive ER+ bc patients? I would not feel secure with using it as the sole decision-making tool for node-positive patients as the study on node-positive patients involved such a small number of women. I saw four oncologists prior to chemo. First onc said I was not a suitable candidate for OncotypeDX test. I didn't even ask the second onc about the test. First and second onc gave me different chemo recommendations and didn't take my prior medical history into account. So I went to a third onc and she was the one who ordered the test. When it came back with a score of 18 she said she would leave it up to me whether to have chemo or not. I felt I didn't have the necessary information to make that decision. So then I went to a fourth onc who didn't even want to look at the Oncotype result. She said they don't factor it into the decision when the patient is node-positive. I did have chemo and rads and I'm glad now that I did what I could to prevent a recurrence. I've been on Tamoxifen for about a year and a half. So my experience was that only one out of four oncologists/hospitals were willing to look at Oncotype. That was two years ago and possibly things have changed since then.",

I went to see a neuroncologist last week at the recommendation of my regular oncologist. He thinks that what I have is post-chemo rheumatism. He said he has seen it in other cancer patients and it usually goes away after a couple of months. He suggested taking Aleve in the meantime. At the time of onset of the pain, I hadn't yet started Tamoxifen and wasn't on any other drugs post chemo, so it would seem that the chemo drugs are to blame. In your case, I suppose it could be the chemo drugs, Avastin or the Arimidex. You might want to post on a thread relating to Avastin or Arimidex to see if others experience joint pain with those.",

Yes, chemo won't prevent you developing another tumor down the road, but it should get rid of any cancer cells circulating around the body and thus prevent local or distant mets. And those cancer cells are sneaky buggers. Even for those lucky enough to have no lymph node invasion, there is still no guarantee that the cells haven't gone further afield. As for risk factors for breast cancer -- as one of the speakers said at a cancer survivors event I attended last week, the main risk factor is being a woman. About one in eight U.S. women (just under 12%) will develop invasive breast cancer over the course of her lifetime. As for family history -- I too believed the myth that most women with breast cancer have a family history of the disease. But the majority of women diagnosed with breast cancer do not have a family history of the disease.",

So now there's a mad chase to find a PS around here who does DIEP and hope to still be able to use the same breast surgeon. And also not to have to postpone it much further.",

I stopped posting here as I was getting a bit overwhelmed with all the advice I was getting. I was supposed to have surgery this week too, but canceled. I felt I should go for a second opinion. Also I was running into difficulties with insurance not wanting to pay for DIEP reconstrucion with my chosen PS. I'm going for a second opinion on Monday and a third opinion the week after.  But how are you doing? I'm sure these days are crazy for you. I'm already making lists of thing to do, things to buy. Are you able to switch off and think about other things. When I was first diagnosed, I was consumed with thinking about myself and feeling sorry for myself but then I figure my brain got oversaturated and I was able to just turn off those thoughts ... at least for the moment. I don't know what kind of basket case I'll be a few days before surgery.",

You can get gel packs in a kind of sleeve in places like Bed Bath and Beyond. It's easier to use a gel pack (which you can keep in the freezer) than to be messing around with crushed ice. Once the swelling goes down, it does help to massage the are where you have the hematoma to break it up. I would call the place where you had the MRI and ask them for advice too. In my case, the nurse who assisted in the first two biopsies didn't apply enough pressure after the biopsy to staunch the bleeding. Another nurse told me that was what led to the hematoma. I already had a diagnosis of IDC when I went for the MRI. The three suspicious areas biopsied via MRI all came back benign. ",

When doctor was finished he applied some compression to the breast then handed over to the nurse. She applied some compression using the palm of her hand, then applied surgical tape and once I got dressed gave me a small ice-pack to place inside my bra. Within a short time it became evident that I wasn't just going to end up wiht some minor bruising at the biopsy sites. The breast turned from pink to a deep maroon/magenta color accompanied by a lot of pain. I followed post-biopsy directions last night -- I took it easy, took Tylenol for the pain (and it was quite painful) and applied ice packs to the area. The two icepacks that I was provided with were about the size of a tea bag and came to room temp in about five mintues so I'm not sure how effective they could be. I also wore my bra overnight as I figured the compression would help. I was still bleeding slightly from one of the biopsy sites when I went back today. Today's nurse said that more prolonged compression by hand immediately after the biopsy would have prevented this. But it's too late for that now. She applied new surgical tape, and suggested the applying a warm compress (washcloth rung out in warm water and placed in a baggie) would help the blood break down. Does this sound right? I was supposed to end today's visit with a mammogram to confirm the positioning of the clips applied at the three biopsy sites. But the mammo tech didn't want to subject the breast to even more compression. I now have the mammo scheduled for Friday, but I wonder are they being too optimistic in thinking the breast would have recovered by then. Does anyone have any suggestions for me to speed up the healing of the hematoma?

At that stage the Oncotype DX was not mentioned. So I went for a third opinion and that MO did order the Oncotype DX. In the meantime, she was giving me my options regarding chemo.

I struggled with making a decision and felt that I didn't know enough. Someone suggested seeing Dr. Sparano. When I said this to the MO, she called him herself as she knows him well and he said that the existing data on using Oncotype with node-positive women was too scant and he strongly advised that I have chemo. In the end I went to a fourth MO who reviewed everything thoroughly again and strongly advised chemo. I started out with four treatments of AC which I found difficult. Then I had four treatments of CMF. I'm glad I did chemo. ",

I'm in New York State and last year NYS passed a law extending COBRA coverage for an additional 18 months, for a total of 36 months. However, it only covers those on fully-insured plans. Unfortunately, my employer was self-insured so they are not obliged to continue coverage. I contacted my local congresswoman's office for their advice/help on this issue. They passed my details on to the Dept of Social Services asking them to look into the situation. It's been three weeks and I haven't heard back from them. I think the idea was to see if I could get Medicaid. I'm currently on unemployment benefits and they would need to run out before I would fall below the income ceiling. Even then I don't think I would qualify as I have some savings in an IRA and a 401K. I'm looking into getting coverage under a low-cost plan, Healthy NY. Premium would be about $300/month. There are some disadvantages such as needing a referral for every consultant visit, only certain doctors covered and my nearby hospital and my breast surgeon not covered as they're over the state line. But at least it's insurance. ",

At first it was in the upper arms and shoulder joint but gradually my hands became affected. The pain sometimes wakes me at night and is always worse first thing in the morning. The pain in the upper arms has lessened but the pain in my hands has gotten worse. Last night, I noticed the the area between the knuckle joints has become swollen. At first I thought the pain was due to twisting my neck to one side and holding my hands above my head while having rads in the prone position. But if it was just muscular strain it would likely have gone away in a couple of days.  When I spoke to the medical onc, she said she hadn't given me any chemo drug which might cause this. Yet I've read that joint pain is not uncommon both during and after chemo. When I went to see the onc last week, she didn't even examine my arms or hands. She referrred me for an MRI of the neck. Order form said purpose was \"to rule out mets.\" I had the MRI on Thursday and am still waiting for results. Onc also suggested that I go to see a neurologist. I have that appt on Tuesday.  With swelling in my hands, I'm inclined to think that the chemo triggered something like rheumatoid arthritis. Anyone else have a similar experience? Wondering if this is likely to go away on its own or is there something that should be done to prevent joint damage.

Met with two PS, one does pedicled TRAM flap, the other does DIEP. The first is definitely not for me w the risk of hernia and loss of abdominal muscle. So I said I would go with the DIEP option but this PS has not worked with my BS before and scheduling is going to be very difficult and of course delayed. So while waiting for surgery date, I spoke to a surgeon in Ireland. I sent him all my records via my brother, who is a friend of his. He trained at Sloan Kettering and his opinion was that doing an Mx is overkill. He felt that a lumpectomy with wide margins would be OK. He gave me names of two colleagues he worked with at Sloan Kettering so I can get a second opinion. I sent my records on to one of those and am waiting to hear back with an appt date. Hopefully it will be soon. I wish the path ahead was clearer instead of having all these forks in the road and wondering if one is going in the right direction. Anyone else go for a second opinion? Did it solidify your original decision or make you more confused? Did you tell your original BS that you were seeking a second opinion? ",

I really felt that I was getting the expertise of a whole team there. Because I was node-positive, the onc I met with insisted on chemo. Also, they asked for all my records and I mean ALL to review everything again. So instead of relying on reports as many oncologists do, the reviewed all imaging and pathology slides on which the reports were based. And they found a micromet in a second lymp node which had been missed in the original review. This didn't change my treatment plan but made me realize how thorough they are. Yes, the Oncotype DX test is new and I do think it's a useful tool for those who are otherwise having a hard time making a decision about chemo. When I was originally diagnosed, the breast surgeon told me that chemo was almost certainly part of my future even without positive nodes. She said cancer cells can be sneaky and get past the lymph nodes without leaving a trace.  I do think that if the cancer cells have already shown their tendency to stray by showing up in the lymph nodes (as in my case), then one can't be certain that they haven't traveled further afield. They will not show up on scans until it's too late. It would be a shame if you had to go all the way to NY to get your treatment of choice. Could MSKCC suggest somewhere in Chicago? and maybe work with you and the doctors there.",

I finished chemo in Feb 2010 and toward the end the night sweats were the worst. Then after rads I started Tamoxifen in April 2010, so that's just over a year ago. Then things got much worse. Things were even worse during the night with being woken constantly with night sweats but were pretty rough during the day too. My chillow was my constant companion for months. I keep it in the fridge and would put it on top of my pillow at night. I rarely get night sweats now and so have not used the chillow for weeks until last night when I used it rather then turn on the a/c. It's very effective. You might want to get one and at least it would give you relief at night. If you get a good night's sleep, you will also feel much better during the day. It's much better than flipping your pillow trying to find the cool side. I also got back to walking regularly. And this coincided with the lessening of the hot flashes. It might be a coincidence but walking is good for us anyway. I have another homemade item that helps me with the night sweats. I made a rice-filled neck pillow. I just took a knee-high sock, filled it with rice and knotted off the end. I keep this in the freezer. It will stay cold for a few hours. Mine is not overfilled so I usually grip it in the middle, let the rice fall to the two ends, then twist, place it on my pillow and rest my head so that it cradles my neck. It feels great!  My night sweats and hot flashes are not gone completely but they are much less frequent. They did make me so miserable last summer. I just hope they don't come back again with a vengeance. ",

I will be meeting with the BS on Monday and hopefully I will be clearer then on the best option for me. Have you made a decision yet? Originally the BS surgeon discussed a lumpectomy with me but a breast MRI showed a second lump hiding behind the first (multifocal disease), so the dig will be deeper. She made the argument that it would be difficult to make the breast look aesthetically pleasing after removing so much tissue, but I would be more concerned that something might be left behind.  Then someone said that health insurance might not pay for reconstruction w mast. Not sure if this is true or not. I think emotionaly it would be hard to get used to only seeing one breast there.",

She was concerned that in an effort to keep enough tissue for reconstruction, that it would be more difficult to ensure clean margins. So for both aesthetic reasons and just for peace of mind I've opted for mast w reconst. BS mentioned tram flap. I see that's what you had but of course your order of events was the opposite of what mine will be. You were on the home stretch when you had the reconst. I'm thinking of having immediate reconst at the same time as the mast. Will meet the PS on Tuesday. Hi Toni, how are you doing today? I know you were to see both BS and PS today. Were you able to come to a decision. I think you said that you have surgery next week (week of 6th July) so that's probably putting you under pressure. At least I have another week to mull over my decision. Hi Beachgrl: sorry you have to join us here. I hope your ultrasound is scheduled soon.

I had a biopsy on a mass that showed up in both ultrasound and mammogram. It turned out to be malignant. Before scheduling surgery, the BS asked that I have a breast MRI \"just in case there's anything else there.\" I had the MRI four weeks ago. To my horror, it identified four additional suspicous areas. One was close to and similar in description to the original tumor so that will be removed anyway. Biopsies were ordered for the other three. I had to wait three long weeks for those biopsies and was convinced that both breasts were riddled with cancer. I got the results two days ago -- all three are benign. So I'm just telling you this to let you know that breast MRIs can give a lot of false positives. However, the MRI was still worth it in my case as it identified the satellite tumor hiding behind the known tumor and it's definitely better to know about that prior to surgery. As for the procedure itself, it's completely painless but a little uncomfortable as you will have to lie face down without moving for half an hour or so.  I'm somehat claustrophobic so it kind of helped that I was face down and couldn't see so I didn't actually know when I was in the machine. I made the mistake of eating a large lunch beforehand so that made matters worse as my belly felt so bloated. I'd suggest not eating for a couple of hours prior to the procedure. As for the IV. I think generally the breasts are imaged first without contrast, then reimaged with contrast. They will put an IV in your arm before they start and the contrast solutions (gadolinium) will be released half way through. I didn't feel this and there were no after effects from the dye. They do tell you to drink lots of water afterwards to flush it out of your system. If you are feeling anxious, I'd suggest that you have your doctor give you an Rx for an anti-anxiety medication but if do take something like that, have someone drive you. Also wear comfortable clothing. You will need to remove your top and bra and put on a gown but can leave the rest of your clothes on unless there are zippers or metal buttons. It's kind of comforting to be wearing your own clothes. Ask for headphones so it will block out some of the noise of the machine, it makes a banging noise which can be disconcerting if it's your first time having an MRI.",
