The 1st one came back atypical ductal hyperplasia with microcalcifications tested positive for E-cadherin and strongly positive for estrogen receptor. So confused about it all because why would one say one thi g and someone else say something else. It was birads 4 when I had mammograms. Had a previous ductal lumpectomy 9 years ago on same breast for body nipple discharge, but it was all b9 then. I'm so worried because I am not sure what to think.",

She said I have 8 cm of microcalcifications and is concerned that it will show more dcis. She asked if I considered a mastectomy if these results from mondays surgery comes back malignant, I said yes. What do you think my chances are? And can it come back even after mastectomy with reconstruction? I said I would only do mastectomy and want no reconstructive surgery.",
