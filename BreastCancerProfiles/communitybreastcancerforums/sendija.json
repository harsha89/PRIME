I think that your wife should finish here treatments, and any side effects that she is having she can talk to her oncologist about to help her get through. I am haveing to go in for 6 months for my treatments, and I will do it no matter what. Just hang in there, and tell her to talk to the doctor to help her out. Good luck!",
