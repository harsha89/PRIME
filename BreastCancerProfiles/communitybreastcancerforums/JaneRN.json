Although I have never been diagnosed with any psychiatric problems and can usually tolerate a fair amount of pain, I have struggled with post traumatic stress disorder for months, waking up in terror or sometimes even getting flashbacks during the day, remembering and sometimes actually reliving the wire localization and severe pain. Clinical studies have shown that 70% of women undergoing wire localizations with mammographic guidance experience moderate to severe pain, and about 7% experience vasovagal episodes (dizziness or fainting). I recommend that you ask what kind of pain and anxiety relief they are willing to give you, mentioning the information below: I have found medical studies of helpful methods to ease the pain. (1) Benzodiazepine Premedication, Can It Improve Outcome in Patients Undergoing Breast Biopsy Procedures? by Janet van Vlymen, MD, FRCPC; Monica M. Sa Rego, MD, and Paul F. White, PhD, MD, FANZCA at the Department of Anesthesia and Pain Management, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas (Anesthesia, Mar 1999, Vol.90, No. 3: 740-747). This study demonstrated decreased incidence of moderate-to-severe discomfort during needle localization, as well as decreased vasovagal episodes, after premedication with 1.0 mg midazolam (Versed) or 2.0 mg diazepam emulsion (Dizac) given intravenously 5 minutes before the patient was transferred from the Day Surgery Unit (DSU) to the radiology department. In the radiology department, patients then received local injection of buffered lidocaine before the procedure. (2) Another successful method of effective pain relief for wire localization is described in Paravertebral blockade for minor breast surgery by Terheggen MA, Wille F, Borel Rinkes IH, Ionescu TI, Knape JT (2002 Feb;94(2):355-9). This study found that patients with a paravertebral block who underwent a radiograph wire localization procedure experienced less pain during the procedure, had higher patient satisfaction scores, and were so happy with it that many of them later refused to undergo breast surgery without it. A case study using paravertebral block for wire localization is reported in Management of Breast Needle Localization Patients with Severe Phobia by Farzin Goravanchi, Steve Wang, Alicia Kowalski, Elizabeth Rebello, and Spencer Kee at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, TX. The patient had phobia of mammogram needle localization because of a previous painful, prolonged and difficult wire localization, and she refused surgery unless she was offered effective pain relief. Paravertebral block was performed in the sitting position under sedation with routine monitors and a nurse escort to and from the remote needle localization service, with a resulting \"anxiety free and pain free breast needle localization.\"",
