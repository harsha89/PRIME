    "Content": "susanjc wrote: Does anyone know how long a 2.6cm lump would take to grow?  I read on the John's Hopkins website that large lumps have usually been growing for years.  I just had on (10/12) a screening mammogram that showed a density this size.  Before that in I had a screening mammogram in 1/06 and was called back because my they didn't have my previous mammogram (taken in 1999 or 2006).  I can't remember if I found the old mammogram or not but I did have to go back to get another one in 2/06 (but not a sonogram).  My question is would a lump get that big in 20 months?  Does anyone been told how long a lump would grow.  This seems pretty big to me and would put me at least stage II if it turns out to be cancer.  I go for a diagnostic/sonogram 10/26.
