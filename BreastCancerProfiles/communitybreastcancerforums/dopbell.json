I have been struggling with anxiety and depression my whole life, but it seems that it got worse after the chemo. Also, chemobrain! I'm a practicing gynecologist and I'm here to tell you that my brain just doesn't work like it used to. I even went so far as to get a neuropsychological test done (4 hour test) and it did show that I have memory issues and some attention issues. Got an MRI of my brain which showed some nonspecific changes in the microvasculature. I no longer do deliveries (of babies) or surgeries. I have limited my practice to just office gynecology. It was recommended to me - because of my cognitive issues - to no longer do deliveries or surgeries. It takes me FOREVER to chart - when i used to be able to do it more quickly. And on top of all that, I now have diabetes as well. Apparently the anastrozole that I'm on can cause an increase risk for diabetes. I'm sure it doesn't help that I have a family history of it AND I'm overweight. So, I've decided to walk ever day for at least 45 minutes with my dog at 5 or 6:00 am. I'm doing that to be proactive because I understand the anastrozole can cause joint pains. If I get some of my extra poundage off, maybe my fasting blood sugars will go down, too. Any advise on how to deal with the chemo brain??? I'm considering going on at least partial disability because of it - Any suggestions are welcome!",
