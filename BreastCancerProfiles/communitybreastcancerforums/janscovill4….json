Any hints to break that cycle.  I have been on abraxane and avastin for over a year.  Did Taxol which was a nightmare.  did tykerb and zoleda which was not much better.  I too am sick of chemo but I also want to live so I keep praying for new drugs. There are a lot of long term survivors but think when people are doing well they just don't want to deal with their BC and don't come on these boards.  I need a break from BC too so I am not as involved as a used to be.  Hang in their everyone",
