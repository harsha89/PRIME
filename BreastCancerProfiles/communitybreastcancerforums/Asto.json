Feeling much better, got one drain out yesterday, but still in a weird place. I'm lucky - it was DCIS and surgery had clear margins and lymph nodes were negative. Just struggling now to adjust to what sometimes feels like destruction of my chest:). Hard to look at, even though I know it was what needed to be done. If anyone has words of wisdom for someone almost 2 weeks post, let me know!",

I know I was ER/PR+ and BRCA-, but nobody mentioned HER2. Also, when a nurse practitioner told me I was BRCA - she said there might be another gene and I should still be concerned about my ovaries and get a test (something like OV 125???). My BS (different office), didn't seem concerned or see need for it. I'm not sure who to listen to! I'm extremely lucky for early detection and successful surgery, but am a worrier and want to make sure I do everything right from here on out!",

I am tired of sleeping upright, but the few attempts at lying down have not been met with good results!!! Someday we'll be able to sleep again, right?!!!! Good luck!",

I have one pesky one I can't get to stop draining! My aunt joked I should try a cold medicine to \"dry it up\"!!! Interestingly, I am getting used to it! What I'm not used to is the pressure! Any good ideas? I've got Motrin every 6 hours, have taken some Tylenol PM, but pressure before bed and right after waking is pretty intense (more so after my first fill this past Monday), tips or suggestions welcomed! Wishing a good recovery to everyone!!!!",

My PS has only written \"sports bra\" but the elastic was so painful I couldn't do it. I've been wearing a soft cam during the day and wrapping an ACE bandage over that. The pressure is so intense at night I haven't been putting anything on, which is probably dumb. I had my bilateral mastectomy with SNB and TEs on March 8th. Any tips appreciated!",
