They called yesterday and said the results had not arrived, and that she would call them if I hadn't heard by noon today. Two of the Ladies I have been talking with on this site both received unhappy news yesterday, and I am so saddened by their diagnosis. They are both very strong women, and very determined to beat this, and I know they will. :) Please keep me in your thoughts and prayers. The waiting is really hard, as you all know, and hearing words of support from others is so encouraging. :) Thanks for listening, and sending good thoughts my way! :) Love & Hugs, Wrinklequeen Log in to post a reply",

I just have a weird feeling about my diagnosis of benign. They did the diagnostic mammogram, ultrasound on the 5mm mass in right breast. Then ultrasound guided core needle biopsy. The results were reported by a nurse at the Women's Clinic 3 days later saying it was \"benign, but with some issues in the wording.\" What the heck does this mean? I called the nurse at the Breast Diagnostic Center to ask her, and she looked over my info and said that it looked like it was benign, and she was guessing the wording issue was about what to do next. She said the paperwork couldn't be released until a Dr had reviewed it, and the provider's office had relayed the information to me. She did give me the numbers of the 2 surgical groups they refer patients to, since I think I would like to have the mass removed. I still have not heard from a Doctor, or the Physicians Assistant I saw for the initial mammogram, and who the results were sent to. She is out of town until next week, and has not seen the results yet. Her nurse just gave me the results because I was anxious for the results, but did not have the paperwork yet. I have read on this site that sometimes the DX of benign is given before all of the testing is truly in. I am a huge worrier, but I just feel uneasy about feeling secure w/ the DX of benign yet. Would all of the testing have been in by 3 days? I feel bad about questioning such a great diagnosis, when so many, many new friends on this site have received much different results. I would just like to see the Dr and possibly a breast surgeon and see what they think = wait and see, or remove the mass. Any words of wisdom, or experiences to share, would be very much appreciated! Thanks in advance to everyone here for sharing their stories, their lives, and their hearts with us. Hugs to you all! :) Hugs & Love, Wrinklequeen Log in to post a reply",

It zips in the front like a sports bra. It fits great, zips well and stays zipped, even with my D cup size. I got a 2XL and a XL, and both are great. I got the nude color. They have it in black, but those didn't fit in the back as well. Kind of a racer-back -type thing going on in the back, but even those straps are great and lay down well.:) I think it cost between $17 and $19. The zipper looked a little cheap when it was hanging on the rack, but after numerous zips I give it a gold star! I'm not a petite and tiny thing, and I have that lovely flab that hangs out over a typical sports bra. Well, this doesn't really do that! It comes up just a bit higher, but not so high it bothers armpits - that would have been a deal breaker for me. I have worn it everyday since the core biopsy, and also slept in it 2 days, and it is still a great fit! I wore it to my biopsy appointment, and I'm still wearing it. I'll wear it when I get my lumpectomy, too. Just wanted to share with you lovely Ladies. I spent a lot of time pre-biopsy bra shopping, and I'm glad I took a chance on this one. :) Hugs to all, Wrinklequeen Log in to post a reply",
