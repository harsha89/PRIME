He said he will insert a clip in the area for further future sugieries when the time comes. He said at some point this mass will need to be removed. I really liked the surgeon and he made me feel more at ease. He also said yes it has charectoistics of bc but that doesn't Mean it is. Basiclly just wait some more",

He said that I also have a fibroidadnoma in the same breast and this \"mass\" could possibly be another one. Of course after I left more questions popped up in my head, like, if you can be certain that the one area is a fibroidadnoma why can't you know that this other \"mass\" is one also? What other types of breast masses show up like the one that I have? I should have written these questions down. I'll ask in the morning when I get my biopsy done. This time going in with my paper and pen....LOL",

I felt kind of brushed off, I asked him how scar tissue can have blood flow? He said well, it can. He didn't even bother to do a breast exam following the biopsy on my follow up visit. I am now in the process of getting a second opinion. I go to another Dr. this Friday. I have had 2 biopsies before on the right breast for microcalcifications. I have been going for mammograms and follow up ultra-sounds for almost 10 years. I was even a bi-rad 5 at one point and told it was most certainly cancer. After biopsy, it was found to be benign and I didn't even question that. I am 43, and this is the first time that I have questioned my results. Something in the back of my mind is saying something just isn't right. This is also the first time that I am going for a second opinion. The surgeon that did my biopsy said to just follow up in 6-months. I am just not comfortable with that. I pray all is well with you.",

I am happy your surgeon is being proactive for you and not just going with it \"appears to be\" there is a big difference between appears and is. Sending prayers for good results for you. ",
