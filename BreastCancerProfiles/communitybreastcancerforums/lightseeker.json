I am normally a person who NEVER goes to a Dr. appt with anyone but, I am ok with it. I had a strange rxn to first dose. Immediately upon the IV push by Nurse, I felt a increased heart rate and then \"cold\" that moved down my body from chest to feet. I'm not sure if it was due to temperature of the solution? They believed that it was anxiety and gave me an ativan, waited 15 min and then continued (without further reaction). I felt a slight pain/tenderness while washing hair today. I'm not sure if this is THAT pain and hair loss will commence promptly? I've ordered 4 wigs and none have arrived yet; I hope I get some sort of tracking info today. I thought I had planned well but, I guess not everyone can be Amazon Prime :) I do have beautiful scarves and bandanas that match my handbags (and shoes) so I guess I will go that route, for now. My last week has been mostly ok so I was able to eat well. I feel prepared to begin this again. Fingers crossed. ",

Well, my platelets (and RBC, WBC) are so low, 39K, that they could not treat me this week and it pushed me further into a funk, I feel devastated. I use to be so full of life and now, I just can't. I think part of this funk is because I was always a woman with a plan and a goal and now I'm just drifting. I am a government chemist for 24+years and decided to go to Nursing school at night and become and RN, at age 50, so that I could give back. Well, my last topic in school was breast disorders. Nurses are responsible for teaching their patients how to do BSE (Breast Self Exam). I never have done this; just did mammo/sono yearly since age 40. So, as I was teaching myself how to do BSE, I found the lump. So I graduated nursing school and two weeks later got diagnosed with breast cancer.  I had planned on continuing on with schooling but chemo is exhausting (I work full time). I have no plan. A friend told me that my new plan is to get healthy but I have no control over this. Not being able to get my treatment feels like I can't even follow thru on a plan to get healthy.  I just needed to rant; I know everyone here gets it. Serious illness is just so devastating. I sometimes think it is the last piece of my nursing education - learning how my patient's feel. I'm a reason and logic person (not religious) trying to make sense of this.  Thanks for listening...

I love seeing the designer clothes/bags, travel, homes and then some nasty (funny) cat fights, every once in awhile.

Peggy is a recent double MX, who lost her mom at 51 from breast cancer. She is currently undergoing expansion, and reconstruction. Well, the tears started streaming! I have to say, I'm really looking forward to watching this season, especially the new character, Peggy. I guess that I want to see (believe) that breast cancer doesn't change and destroy everything.

Day 6, post Chemo, I finally had an appetite and wow (of course)- what a difference eating makes! I am about one year post bariatric surgery (gastric sleeve) so I have a smaller (80%) stomach than normal so when I could not eat, it is possible that I was consuming less than 500 calories a day (I was too tired to keep track). I'm basing this on a five lb weight loss for the week (15-20k calorie deficit) Eating (of course) definitely upped my energy level. I actually went on a walk with hubby last night. It was only fifteen minutes but I saw that it did increase my energy level a bit. I can do this. Best to all, Eve",

Dr. prescribed Z-pack, which I started today. I do not believe it is bacterial but, I'm going to do it anyway. The cough/post nasal drip is the worst part because it keeps me up. I have not needed to take off from work because it is all low grade symptoms. Dr. also prescribed narcotic for pain; I believe it also helps with cough suppression. I prefer my kratom tea as an alternative so I may stick with that instead. Just hoping symptoms dissipate by Wed when I'm scheduled for 2nd chemo infusion. Fingers crossed.",

My PS has told me that I am probably eligible for enlarging my breasts with fat (from tummy tuck) down the road, if I wish but, as we all know, I have much bigger fish to fry right now. In my post-op period, I have been able to work and go to Dr. appointments. I have begun PT to hopefully ward off Lymphedema. I did the simulation for radiation. I even had cataract surgery! I'm off to the dentist later today, as well as oncologist and port flush. My one concern is the redness; I'll question my Onc about this later today. I had some antibiotics in the house so I took some this weekend. I know it's not good to take antibiotics without knowing cause but, again, I've got bigger fish to fry:) I'll keep my eye on this thread and add to it when I am able. Eve",
