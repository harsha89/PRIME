Its been a whirlwind month when a self diagnosed lump turns out to be IDC...last mammogram was less than a year ago. CRAZY! Anyhow, I have an excellent team in place and will undergo Sentinel node test and BMX with TE's on Aug. 30th. I was in the city today going over final list of questions with BS and PS. MRI showed it to be multiple centric - no chest wall involvement or axillary lymphadenopathy shown. PET scan shows tumor but nothing to impede surgery...no sign of lymph node involvement but have to wait for results of sentinel node test. I remain hopeful! My BS said that I will need chemo but have to wait for final pathology...Rads? I am still waiting BRCA test results. I feel good. Keeping up with the exercise and playing as much tennis as I can before surgery. I am busy getting things organized for my children (4 and 7) who will start the school year on Sept. 8th. Busy time. Sending you all warm thoughts and gentle hugs (especially those in recent post-op) thanks for listening/reading!",

I received confirmation of 8:00 sentinel node dye injection and 9:30 am surgery time. As of this afternoon there were only 25 patients at NYU Tisch Hospital (it's a 700+ bed facility) they evacuated all the patients on Thursday In preparation for Irene...Crazy, right? We made it through the storm, power restored, no water in basement but a large tree limb (20 ft long) did fall but luckily no damage to house. I received a lot of telephone calls and email well wishes and I realized how lucky I am to have such a supportive network around me (present company included)! I shared bedtime stories with my children...my son (4) wanted to give me extra kisses....so sweet! I hope to be home on Thursday if all goes well...I will post then! Thank you Ladies...you are so inspiring! Nanadeb- my pet scan showed a tiny spot on my thyroid as well. I will have it biopsied after I complete my BC treatments. My father, an OBGYN, said that he wouldn't be surprised if it is a benign node/cyst as the thyroid is a very active gland and would pick up the sugar dye. I'm sorry you have to go through this...so frustrating! I'll be thinking of you...sending good wishes and a big hug!",

Sentinel node test worked and BS removed the three nodes that had dye - one of which had cancer cells so he took out some more...didn't ask for exact number figuring the final path will give details. PS said phase 1 of reconstruction could hot have gone better. He only had to use a very small amount of seri scaffold (alternative to alloderm) to attach to my pectoralis for TE's. I'm hoping for the best. I am not in too much pain and have kept to a schedule. I am trying to eat well and drink lots of water. Using Tylenol instead of percocet hoping for a bm soon. I am spending my time upstairs in my room as I don't want to go up and down stairs. Walking laps around each bedroom and down the hall. My sister in law (rn) has been so kind to help with my drains...I was expecting little granades and these are huge reservoir round vacuum things. I see PS on Wed. And hope they will come out then. I see BS on Thursday but he'll call when path comes back...nervous about that! I am so appreciative to all of you and your insights..it has made things a lot less scary! You are a special group of ladies... Your honesty and candor is greatly appreciated! Enjoy your holiday weekend! Thank you again.",

I received a beautiful yoga inspired bead bracelet in the mail today...faceted turquoise beads (stone of healing) with a silver hamsa charm (positive energy and good health)...a dear friend sent it to me and I was overwhelmed by her thoughtfulness...it will become my wonder woman cuff!

It has been so helpful to read all of the posts knowing I am not alone with various pains, drains and limited mobility. I saw my BS on Thursday also very pleased with surgical sights. path report showed several areas of cancer In breast microscopic metastasis found in 2 nodes (via SN test). Right breast had several areas of hyperplasia and calcifications so good call to take that one as well. Met with MO afterward I love her! Based on all my numbers I will start with AC cocktail once every two weeks x 4 cycles...neoplasia (?) injection 24 hrs later for WBC. And A steroid for nausea. Followed by Taxol every 2 weeks x 4 cycles. Due to my age, tumor size and node involvement she also recommends rads. I will see RO for that. Followed by 5 years of tamoxifen. I'll lose hair approximately 16 days of first treatment...I will go into menopause...(any advice on dealing with symptoms? I will be unable to take ant hormone therapy do to E+/ P+ status.) I will go for MUGA scan and wig shopping next week. I will also be meeting with Thyroid surgeon regarding small spot that showed up on my PET scan. I will start treatment 9/19 or 9/26. Still waiting BRCA test results. Insurance finally decided to approve it! I went to lunch yesterday, it was nice to get out. I have been doing my arm stretches and was given the ok to do some lower body and ab work. I will be having expansions and implant transfer along the way...So much to absorb...Thank you for sharing your experiences! Bless you all!",

First round hit me hard...nausea, vomiting, emotional breakdown. This time they gave me a stronger anti-nausea med and it is much better. I'm walking daily and find the fresh air wonderful. Its the fatigue that is hard to get used too. I had my first fill last Friday. All went well with that. Had my head shaved and a final fit/cut of my wig...not bad. The kids colored make up and hair on the face of the wig stand...very cute. Taking it day by day...can't wait for the AC to be over as I heard he Taxol will be a bit easier. Thank you for sharing your war stories...it's greatly appreciated. Take care and hugs all round, Best, Stacey.",
