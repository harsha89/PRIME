I will take them as I am still terrified of all this! I do not know if I will get chemo or rads yet....I guess that will come after my surgery next week to see what pathology says on it. I am currently, and Pray that I still will be, Non-Invasive when we do this. That my BMX will go smoothly and easily...and that my follow ups are good and CLEAN!  Question? With no reconstruction...how will they be able to check me later?",
