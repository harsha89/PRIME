After two weeks of my Lumpectomy went back to see my doctor for follow up and expecting to discuss Radiation treatment. I was so excited feeling that i'm about to cross my bridge half way with my journey in the world of BC. But it did'nt turned out what we would like to hear. My doctor discussed about what my pathology findings, lymph nodes are negative, of course hearing that really makes me happy. The bad part was telling me to do another surgery to make sure that my right breast will be clear with cancer cells around the margins. I still have cancer cells left in my right breast.The tumor was 3.5 cm in size double to what they thought it was seen in my mammogram & ultrasound. I was deeply sadden as i will be back with 0 step again. My BC stage move to stage 1 to stage 2. Only if i knew this will going to happen i  had chose mastectomy in the first place. Finding the size of my tumor they did advice the oncotypedx test to help me if i will be benefit with chemo. Still waiting on the result. Waiting is just so unbearably stressful sometimes... no matter how u keep yourself busy my mind just can't get away from it. I am worried & scared for surgery again and the expectations. On top of all this, we are ready to move to our new home in Colorado supposed to be on the first week of July. All that had been plan ahead including all my first plan treatment with my first surgery was went all to trash now. It's been really frustrating. Removing my breast & chemo is what i try to avoid. But seems like that's where my destination is. Still hoping for low score with onctotype thou. If you don't mind i need some help. After mastectomy how many follow up with the doctor i will be expecting? I am doing reconstruction as well. Anyone here can share me your experience what you been through with mastectomy plus reconstruction? IF i will be doing chemo is immediate reconstruction wlll be good  or just wait later after all the treatment? Honestly i am very confused & find it hard to decide what to do. I don't wanna hear myself later that \"i wish i do this\" or \"i wish i should just wait\". I am tired reading & getting all the info i could get, but still i ended up beig more confused. Thank you for having me here & lending me your time. Dx 2/16/2011, IDC, 6cm+, Stage IIB, Grade 2, 0/3 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

That's why i am confident to share some of my concerns here. Feeling a little better now, trying my best to be more positive & brave to deal my new world. On June 8 i will have appointment with my Oncologist in Houston @ MDAnderson. By then i will know my Oncotypedx score if chemo will benefit me. If ever i will be on the road with chemo, i will consider to wait before my reconstruction. I have decided for mastectomy to get over with it. I have only small A cup size. I am thinking there's no difference if i will have re-excision. I hope my doctor will help me more to decide once i talk to her.  To all of us... GOD Bless Us in our Journey.",

It helped a lot to educate myself and not worrying too much. Done all the test and just waiting my BRCA test because of my age & no related cancer history my doctor recommend me to do the test and also help me to decide with my surgery just in case if it turns out ( + ). Crossing my fingers with this.... hoping & praying for  ( - ). I choose lumpectomy & radiatoion then Tamoxifen.  But  it may change my treatment since they still have to do my lymph node test when i have my surgery. Tentative date for surgery May 03. I'm hoping for the best for all of us here. I'm ready to face the Battle to get over with all this BC Challenges. It maybe for a while... but looking forward for VICTORY after.

I'm worried, as i am thinking about the side effects. I'm praying & wishing that all is going to be ok. I will be on 6 months treatment and top the 7 1/2 weeks radiation. I never expected i will end up like this. This is not what we all expected. My luck!!! Preparing myself  and all the stuff i am going to need. My medications for emergency are all set... now, i am reading all your food suggestions! :) But regards with my hair... not doing anything yet. I always have my hair long in many years, i'm still debating to shave it or cut it slowly. It's not that easy than what i thought ... When will i expect to loose all my hair in chemo?",

But after my masectomy surgery they found a lymphovascular involvement & the size of my tumor. This all leads to chemotherapy. Chemo is not that bad as i thought aside from the hair loss. Mostly fatigue and minimal SE's is what i encountered. I only had bad nausea & vomiting one time. I am on my 12 rounds of Taxol this week. This will be the last for Taxol, then FAC every three weeks for 4 rounds. Then 7 1/2 wks Radiation.So far i am doing fine. I only take it easy after my treatment. Give myself a rest like  a day or two. Fatigue is what i hate most, so what i did i always force myslef to move around than sitting or lying down. I did gain a couple of lbs thou. I joined a membership in the gym too. This helps me to feel better and fight the fatigue.  Don't let yourself get worried & be stress about the whole thing... u need to be strong and healthy to avoid all the bad SE's. Good luck to you. Have faith & you can do it!",

As i am only diagnosed as stage 1. Now, after my MX they discover some problem, i'm on my way now to chemo & rad therapy. That's why i asked here with their experiences to make me feel a little better that i did a right choice only removing the affected breast. My doctor did'nt really recommend me to remove the unaffectd breast but they stated that they can have it remove if that is my decisions. So far my left breast is nothing to worry about. I guess, it scare me after i'd talked to the lady.",
