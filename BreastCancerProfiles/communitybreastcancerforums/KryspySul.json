    "Content": "KryspySul wrote: Hello. I'm a 30 year old obese white woman with a family history of breast cancer. (I don't know what kind.) I'm worried I may have IBC. For awhile now I have what looks like a crease line in my breast. It also has a redness and tenderness that won't seem to go away. Tonight I noticed that the edge of the redness seems to be swollen like a welt. I'm strarting to see redness in my other breast now as well. Am I being a hypochondriac or do I have l legitimate concern to be worried? The only lumps I have in my breast are a direct result of seatbelt trauma from a recent car accident. Which doctor do I visit to be checked out? Primary, Gyn, or other? Thank you for your responses. Log in to post a reply",
