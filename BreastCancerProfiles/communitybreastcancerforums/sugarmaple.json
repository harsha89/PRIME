And that\u2019s all ok...all of that is wrapped into how we feel. I hope you all have a good Thursday out there-living in the moment ",

I was never a fan of birth control, and the way it made my body feel...I\u2019m curious what will happen with the estrogen blocking fun of this pill :) Take good care...love reading updates and seeing all the courage here!
