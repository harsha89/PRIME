This website has really provided a great education to me and I knew that I would have alot of support if I did end up needing it down the road. I found a lump in my right breast in early January and did not think too much of it because it felt soft and very movable ( I had heard that bc is typically very hard and rough around the edges). My mom had DCIS when she was 37 and was treated with just a lumpectomy at the time. After the ulstrasound confirmed that it was a solid mass I scheduled an appointment with a breast surgeon. I was not able to meet with the surgeon but his physician's assistant examined me and said it was probably a fibroidadenoma but I should opt for the excisional biopsy based on my history. I went in last Thursday after a very tense and exhausting 10 days of waiting. I cried so many times during those 10 days and nearly drove my fiance mad with my 'worst case scenarios' and tales of dread. We are getting married in August and I was just so pissed that this was happening right now! (I know - maybe I needed a little perspective, huh?). Anyways, after the surgery the surgeon came and found us and said he was almost positive it was a fibroidadenoma. He said they had 'chopped it up' right there in the hospital and that the path results were rarely wrong when they were able to get a good look at it (an advantage to the excisional biopsy route). I just got my results back today and it was BENIGN. I am so relieved and happy and I cannot believe how much anxiety I lived through in the last 4 weeks. I also cannot believe that I was stressed out about finding a photographer for my wedding just a few weeks ago! ;-) Anyway, what I wanted to say is that everyone should remember that it really is true that 80% of lumps are benign and generally the people who had benign lumps don't post on message boards (not that there is anything wrong with that if they do). So while you are anxious and awaiting your results you tend to forget that many, many women have had normal biopsies and moved on with their lives accordingly. I have the utmost respect and sympathy for those women on this board whose biopsies did turn out to be something but I just want to emphasize that if you are waiting please remind yourself that of the 2 women you might know that have breast cancer there are probably 8 that had a benign biopsy. That is one of the disadvantages to the internet when you are dealing with a health scare as in my experience most people who end up with 'normal' results don't stay online long enough to tell people the good news. (Though it seems like there are many women here who have done so which is great). I just hope my 'story' can make even one 'not diagnosed but worried' woman a little less anxious. I wish you all the best of luck and much strength in your journeys, whatever direction they may be. ~ Amy Log in to post a reply",
