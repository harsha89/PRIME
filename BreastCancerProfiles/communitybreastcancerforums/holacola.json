    "Content": "Mar 17, 2015 10:36AM - edited Mar 17, 2015 10:37AM by holacola My daughter had contralateral breast cancer in 2014 at age 24 and was diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer in January of 2015. We had the full panel genetic tests done and she was diagnosed with homozygous chek2 del c. It seems that having two copies of the chek2 gene have predisposed her to a higher incidence of cancer. They told her she should avoid X-rays and ct scans as these could promote a new cancer. Chek2 is a DNA repair disorder of some sort. The rest of the family is being tested. This is very rare, chek2 is seen in something like 1% of northern european populations and two copies of the gene mutation is extremely rare.",
