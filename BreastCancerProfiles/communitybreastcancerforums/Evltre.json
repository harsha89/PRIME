She was diagnosed with ILC, stage 1, grade 1 in February this year and had a wide excision and radiation which finished today. During the last few months she has had increasing headaches, they did a cat scan a few weeks ago and idenitified a 16mm meningioma in her front lobe. Last week she had a MRI with contrast to determine more information about it and today we recieved the awful news that the MRI also discovered 2 tiny enhancing medial parietal lobe cerebral lesions suspicious for tiny cerebral metastases. Because there had been no evidence of spread in her SNB the scans were reviewed again and by radiologist/neuro specialist and a meeting was held yesterday to discuss the case, we were told today they are highly convinced that these are a spread of the breast cancer. Obviously this was really upsetting for mum (and us) - but it appears that other than a follow up MRI to check on progress of them there isn't any kind of \"plan\" at the moment in terms of treatment. The onc said they're too small to be causing any problems at the moment so they are going to monitor them. Should we be pushing for something else? Some other form of action? Any advise would be much appericated.",

But the oncologist said today that they are \"so small\" and not symptomatic (found as a result of the meningioma dx) that they felt it was best to wait and see. Doesn't quite sit right with me to be honest and I was hoping that I might find some more info here.",

With regards to mum's brain tumours - she had been having issues around the meningioma - pressure headaches in the front right of her head and feeling of pressure. The actual brain mets themselves are too small at this stage to be likely responsible for any issues",

We actually are still waiting on the er/pr stuff, although the oncologist said it was highly unlikely to be HER+. We were supposed to get the radiology report last week, however it was delayed because the oncologist wanted to meet with the neurologist and radiologist to discuss the findings that there were metastatic spots on the brain - the radiologist is adamant it is. I have a copy of the report here, which actually says very little other than \"2 tiny enhancing cerebral lesions, one within the medial left parietal lobe and one within the medial right parietal lobe measuring up to 2 mm in diameter\" and that they appear to be celebral metastasis. Other than that it talks mainly about the meningioma. The oncologist told me on the phone the radiologist said there was not much else it could be and that he was as shocked as we were that it had spread to the brain.            ",
