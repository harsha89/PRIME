      "Content": "Faulkh wrote: Ladies One of our sisters (Marybe) from the Stage IV boards had posted the following request several days ago, but only to that board.  I offered to add to other boards.  Basically she entered a contest with American Express regarding how you used your frequent flyer miles.  A dear friend of hers used her miles to fly Marybe to MDAnderson for a consult regarding her Stage IV disease.  While winning would be nice, it is the competition that really is exciting for Marybe.  The following is her original post.  All you have to do is click the blue link and it will take you directly to her picture (in the airplan on their flight) then click the vote button.  You may need a facebook account to vote (not sure about this).  You can vote once a day and the contest ends at midnight on the 16th, so not too many days left.  Can you please vote for Marybe, it would do wonders to raise her spirits.  Thanks in advance, apologize if you are reading this again, I am trying to get onto as many pages as possible for the widest audience. Original Post  DREAM & REDEEM from American Expressapps.facebook.com Check out my photo at the Memorable Miles photo contest from American Express. Vote for my entry and help me win 100,000 miles!      I have a favor to ask of you who take the time to read this and hope I am not being trivial or petty since it is not directly related to breast cancer.  However, I think we all get sick of discussing treatment and side effects and dealing with cancer every day and sometimes need a distraction.  I know I do and I certainly could use a nice trip, but need some help getting the miles to cover one. This is a long shot I know, but the BCO women sent a woman and her son to an Aerosmith concert and got a makeover for another and won a vacation for another with votes so even though I have very few  so far, I figure there is always hope.  Hope springs eternal is one of my favorite sayings since breast cancer.     Again I apologize if this seems petty and trivial, but it really would be a dream to me.  As soon as the onco told me we are now starting a new ball game and that he doesn't think I am going to be able to continue work and doing my normal routine the way I have been fortunate enough to do thus far,  when we do this new treatment, I got my stuff together and went to apply for a new passport.  If I were to win the miles I don't know where I would go, but it would be somewhere great, like Bruges where SocalledLisa just went or a cruise like BarbaraA .  And the wonderful thing is, if I win the miles so does my friend, Kathy, who without even being asked did not hesitate for a second before saying she would get my ticket to Houston so I could go to MDAnderson with her miles....so this would be a wonderful way to reward her.  All you have to do is click on the Dream and Redeem and a pic of us flying to Houston should come up and then you click on vote.  You do have to sign into facebook to vote so if you aren't a member maybe you have a friend or teenager  who could cast a vote.  As I said it is a long shot, but I have never allowed cancer to cause me to give up my dreams, however I do need some help in achieving this one.  Thanks so much.  Liz Dx 12/20/2010, DCIS, Stage 0, Grade 3, 0/3 nodes, ER+/PR+ Log in to post a reply",

While I agree with many of the other ladies your next steps have to be what will be the easiest for you both physically and emotionally. The most important thing for you is to heal. My only suggestion for you would be to have your husband go with you for the follow up appt if you decide to go back to the first guy. Best wishes to you and I will be praying Liz",

One thing you will learn from reading these boards is that there does not seem to be a standard way across physicians to handle anything. My personal opinion is that more information in terms of testing is better than less for it will enable you to make the best informed decision for your case. So best advice that I could share is use the time to learn as much as you can either from this site or others, come armed at your next appointment with lists of questions and take the time you need to make the right decision. Second and even third opinion never hurt. On a positive note even though they told be my brac testing would take 2 weeks it was back a little earlier so maybe you will get results sooner",

In some ways I am grateful that this overall exhaustion and fatigue was not all coming from the BMX. I was beginning to feel like a bit of a wimp for it has been 6 weeks and I did not have to have chemo or rads so what was causing me to want to crawl up all day in bed, have the palest skin I have ever seen, puffy face etc. My doc thinks that it may have been ongoing for a while and I was just chalking it up to getting older and perimenopause (she indicated to me that this misdiagnosis happens a lot) and the BMX put the stressor on to make my thyroid shut down completely. I do have a family history of thyroid disease so I guess I am not really surprised. In the big picture no biggie and this too I will handle in stride Good news is that my older son is home from college and it is great to have him home again. I really do miss him when he is away at school. My little guy is in a school play tonight so looking forward to a good old fashioned family night with ice cream after the performance Best wishes to all Liz",

So the following is a little about myself Found a lump in March of 2010 on a business trip to China. I totally freaked out called my mother and husband in a panic and asked them to get me an appointment as soon as I landed. Primary doc sent me right away for a mamo. Well lump was just a fluid filled cyst but they found some calcifications that they didn't like. I was told to come back in 6 months. My primary did not like that and sent me to see a breast surgeon. I was told at a that point there was a change from previous mamo (several years ago I had not been religiously getting them). But she thought I could wait 6 months and see if this was just some calcifications that were no worry or if they grew or shifted. I waited the 6 months then came back for another mamo in Oct. Did not look good and I was sent for a sterocystic (sp?) biopsy. This came back with DICS. I then went for an MRI in Nov. BS told me that a lumpectomy should be scheduled so I did that right before Christmas. Results surprised my BS for there was extensive DCIS LCIS AHP with no clear margins. She sent the slides out to have read at Fox Chase for a second opinion. Came back the same but with more of a sense of urgency and recommendation of MX. Well I wasn't expecting that and BS said let's try a partial MX and see if I can get clean margins. That surgery was scheduled for Jan 2011. She barely got clean margins half my right breast gone and the path report still found extensive LCIS and AHP throughout every sample. So to make a long story short after many consults with BS, oncologist, radiologist and 2 PS. I decided that I would just have a BMX so that I would not have to keep waiting for the next shoe to drop. BMX was 3/28/11. I did surprising well but I really took it easy. I opted for implants and currently have TEs. I started with 150cc at time of surgery I had one fill on 4/25 with 60cc I am scheduled for the next bon on 5/16. PS likes to go slow in the beginning. No problems accept sleeping I can't get comfortable no matter what I try. I just had a visit with my primary today for I am exhausted and I didn't know if something else was going on. She thinks it is just lack of sleep so she gave me a sleeping pill and said to try to see if that would help but try not to take it every night. I go back to work on 5/23 and I am concerned. She drew some more blood for thyroid testing (since I have a family history) just in case. Well that is my story. We didn't plan to be here but this community really has helped me through some bad days and nights. I continue to marvel at the openness, honesty and courage of all of you. Best wishes on your journey. Liz",

Best wishes for a full and speedy recovery Babsbling congrats on returning to work and sorry to hear about the wound care issues. Hopefully things will settle down for you shortly Question I have posted previously on other threads about shifting TEs. I feel like I have boobs under my arms. It is not painful just annoying. I understand from others that this may be normal. My concern now is that I thought the swelling was finally going down (I had been doing stretching regularly and walking ) but tonight it seems to have swelled again under both arms after driving for a hour. Does anyone else experience this. I don't seem to feel the TE constriction except when I drive which concerns me as I head back to work in a couple of weeks for I have a 2 hour commute one way",

The March board is quieter than the others so I am taking that as a good sign all are doing well I go for my second fill on Monday and I am so ready. My PS goes slow in between fills (3 weeks) and I kind of have a sloshing sound coming from my chest now and no tightness at all. I guess this is a good thing but after Monday I will be back to more tightness and muscle spasms not sure which way is better go. He is going to try 100 cc this time so that should fill things up a bit. I am going to ask for appointments spaced out every 2 weeks and see what he says Liz",
