I joined to see if you could have lymphedema in just one finger.  I guess i got my answer.  My cat bit me and I did not treat it with great care even though I have heard many talks on lymphedema.  It got infected and swollen.  Then it went down, but then it got swollen again so that I can barely bend it and it hurts.  My doctor thought nothing of it.  So I asked a friend who lectures on lymphedema and she said to get help right away.  All your comments help.",
