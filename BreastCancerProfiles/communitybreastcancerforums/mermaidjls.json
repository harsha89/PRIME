I couldn't look at myself in the mirror because all I saw was this hideous scar and a constant reminder of all the pain and suffering.  I wanted something beautiful and girly....something that made me feel less of a walking freak show.  I decided on a pink lotus flower.  I loved they symbolism of the lotus.  It is beautiful and getting it done was the best decision I have since diagnosis. I can look at myself in the mirror again and smile. While I have shown it to a couple of friends, no one will ever see it beyond my doctors...it's like my special secret.  If you really want a tattoo, go for it. Search the internet for ideas and make sure you really want a tattoo and pick a design you can live with for the rest of your life.  You might start with a henna tattoo to see what you think.  They only last about 4/5 weeks.  If you would like to see a pick of the tattoo, I will email it to you.  I love mine so much I'm going to see about getting something to cover the long scar on my back...you know what they say....there's no such thing as one tattoo.  :)",
