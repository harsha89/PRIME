My advice is to moisturise hands and feet twice a day even if you have no symptoms yet. I waited for symptoms when I started xeloda and my feet got very sore, couldn't walk at times. I use Aveeno and it helps. Also always wear gloves when doing housework as the tips of my fingers  got very sore. Not sure about other side effects yet but the good news is this combination has given lots of us good control of the  disease for longer. Hope this is some help. Be good to yourself. Wallflower.",
