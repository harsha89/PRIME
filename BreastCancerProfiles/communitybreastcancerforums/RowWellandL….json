Good luck and make sure to keep us posted. You too pegasus.",

I had a biopsy for micro calcifications in 2005 that were benign. 5 years later I had a second biopsy for more calcifications near that same area. Of course I freaked too! Turned out to be benign again, Hooray!! So try not to worry too much the odds are in your favor.",

I have a benign kidney tumour called an AML that was diagnosed incidentally in June of 2017 when I had a CT scan for something else. It has to be monitored because the size is borderline and they can hemorrhage. In April of 2018 my CT scan showed my AML was stable and everything else clear including my liver. Fast forward to two weeks ago when my new urologist (I moved to a new state) suggested we do an MRI. The kidney is the same but I have a 5 cm liver mass that needs further testing. BTW all scans I've had used contrast so this was definitely not on the April scan. If course I am nervous. After reading about liver cancer i don't seem to be a candidate for that but who knows. I'm concerned about Breast or Ovarian metastasis. I have no history of either but am one month late for my annual mammogram. After reading up here I know that mammograms are not dispositive anyway. Anyone else diagnosed by a totally asymptomatic large liver mass? Bloodwork done in late Nov was all normal. Thanks again this forum is so informative.",

I am angry at all the disinformation about DCIS we've been fed. When I thought I might have it I don't think I would have ever even considered anything more then a lumpectomy. They made it sound like no big deal, This is infuriating! I'm happy I came to this site so now I have the facts. SandiBeach, Grannax, Miaomix, and all that were there in my time of need thank you. Turns out I have a benign liver tumor called a Focal Nodular Hyperplasia. The second most common benign liver mass after hemangioma. The plus side of this anxiety ridden experience is I learned so much about breast cancer, stage 4 in particular. Most women don't have a clue. I will be silently following all my liver mets \"friends\" and wishing you all the best. What a terrific, supportive group. Here's to those Israeli scientists! May it please be true.",

No tumor markets done. I had a complete blood panel done Nov 27th and all was fine. Dr didn't mention more blood work yet. I was blindsided by this. Primary liver cancer would be strange I would not seen to be a candidate but of course it's possible.I was looking at cancer sites that metastasize to the liver and breast was one. I know colon is another. I did have a colonoscopy 4 yrs ago. I'm trying to stay off Google but can't find one thing to ease my mind. Thank you for responding!",
