    "Content": "28yroldfatherof3 wrote: I go in the morning for a mammogram and sonogram. Just to refresh I have a two inch by two inch mass in my right areola that goes towards my side. I was wondering when a mass this size is diagnosed is it always in a late stage? I was also wondering if anyone has heard of a hard mass in this area in a male breast that turned out to be benign? Everything I read that is \" subareolar and eccentrical\" is always a sure sign of mbc. Last but not least I know biopsy is the only sure way of knowing but will the test tomorrow pretty much give me my answer of weather or not I will begin fighting for my life? Once again any response will be greatly appreciated. Log in to post a reply",
