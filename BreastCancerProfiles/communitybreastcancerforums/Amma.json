I need to have an excisional biopsy, following a diagnosis of Atypical Lobular Hyperplasia (based on results of steriotactic biopsy). What kind of experience have people had with breast contour - how breasts look  - after an excisional biopsy? My surgeon did not provide much information on this and I'm worried about this. I know that surgeons err on the side of taking out more tissue and that the results can vary based on where they biopsy. Any experience others have had would be helpful and appreciated.",

This is what she said about my situation, in case it is helpful to you: \"There should not be deformity of the breast from this surgery, but there will be a scar.  Sometimes in the upper location, there can be mild indentation.\" My incision will be in the upper location of my left breast. I hope that your surgery goes very well and that the results are benign. Mine is this Friday (13th! that's okay by me!) at noon.  Best, Amma",
