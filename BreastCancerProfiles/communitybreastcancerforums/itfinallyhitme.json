      "Content": "itfinallyhitme wrote: Hello all, Just wondering if I need to worry, or more importantly, if I can do anything. I had surgery last August with SNB, only a few nodes removed, with partial mastectomy. Yesterday evening I noticed a red patch on that arm, a few inches over the wrist. It's not particular painful, or itchy, but persists. I don't know of anything that could have caused it. My hand might be a little swollen - I switched my ring from my other hand to that one to check and it's tighter than normal, but I can still put it on and pull it off. My fingers normally swell a tiny bit from time to time. Is this a common indicator of anything? Thank you. Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "itfinallyhitme wrote: I'm about 3-1/2 weeks post BMX. My abdomen (area just under my breasts, above belly really) seems to be getting bigger and bigger. I thought at first it was an optical illusion because the breasts are not there, but then my clothes got tighter and now don't fit, and today I am kind of shocked that it looks almost like my breasts are still there, just dropped down some inches. I'm having no serious signs of digestive issues, and not eating much. I did have constipation from hydrocodone, but that resolved a couple of weeks ago. Thinking about it, I can't remember passing any gas in weeks (sorry if tmi) but I never did that often. Ive been told by a friend it could be fluid. I don't know what to think or if it's at all common. I plan to ask my surgeon next week but he often brushes aside my concerns as if I'm imagining them (a couple of times I've gotten weird rashes or this or that they can't explain, so they act as if it's not there, but these are real physical changes). Any ideas? Or is this common? Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "itfinallyhitme wrote: OK, I might as well just ask. Because I need to know what to expect. I'm having radical bi-lateral mastectomy in a few weeks. I'm likely to be alone mostof the time. I had a bit of range of motion trouble with the first partial mastectomy and SNB on the right (I'm right-handed). So, what might I expect as far as trouble keeping things clean with toileting? I've long thought bidets are wonderful ideas, and it's too bad they are foreign to Americans. (I've never used one, btw.) But am I going to be able to manage? I've seen hand-held bidets that are basically squeeze bottles with nozzles. Do I need one? Or maybe I won't be able to squeeze. I've seen battery ones too, which I guess don't need to be squeezed. Or am I worrying for nothing. I likely won't have anyone around to help, and REALLY don't want to have to ask, or to endure insufficient results, especially since I can't shower for three weeks (though I am PLANNING to shower from the waist down. Surely there can't be anything wrong with that? Just keeping drain area dry, right?) Thanks for any insight. Log in to post a reply",
