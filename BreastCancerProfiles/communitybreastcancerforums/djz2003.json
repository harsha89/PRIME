Even though I am postmenopausal, he wants to hold off on giving me Arimedex.  Has anyone else experienced Horner's Syndrome...symtoms are droopy eyelid and unevenly dilated pupils caused by compression somewhere on the sympathetic nerve which goes from your brain down your spine across your chest up the neck and to the pupil and lid?  Debbie Dx 12/12/1998, IDC, <1cm, Stage IV, 0/12 nodes, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
