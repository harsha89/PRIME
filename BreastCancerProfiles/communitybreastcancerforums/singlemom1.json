I posted a powerful and emotional video on facebook today about living with MBC since it is MBC awareness day. The video was made by Laura Odom. Not sure if anyone else has seen it but it really hits you.  I had two acquaintances  respond to the post. I know I sound like a high school kid but this really upset me.  I am feeling very alone with this disease lately and am hurt that none of my close friends have commented or called me. I know they do not really get it but the sense of isolation I am feeling is palpable.  I have a 11 year old daughter and at times the fear and anxiety around her well-being is hard to manage.  I am all she has.  No father, no grandparents, no relatives except for extended cousins that live an hour a way.  It has been two years since the MBC diagnosis and I can't help but feel like my friends are tired of the cancer thing. I try to stay positive and not \"burden\" them too much but I guess I had hoped I would of heard from those close to me today.         Dx 2/7/2011, IDC, 2cm, Stage IIA, Grade 3, 0/5 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Dx 9/2015, Stage IV, metastasized to lungs, ER+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I remember him also stating that he was pretty sure it was cancer from what he saw before the results of biopsy was in. I am not sure how much to rely on the subsequent cat scans now.

They diagnosed me with Mets to lungs after biopsy on node in lungs. A number of nodules showed up on the cat scan as well. I was told by consulting MO that nodules we're 99 percent chance cancer also. Treating MO went from saying good chance they are cancer in 2015 to now not thinking they are. I was also told could be from prior pneumonia but last pneumonia was Dec 2010 and cat scans in 2011 did not show nodules. Nodules did not show until 2015. They cannot get to nodules for biopsy. I know smaller they are better chance not cancer. I know shape is also considered. My understanding is if no other concerns they continue to monitor with cat scans and if no changes after 2 years they determine not to be cancer. Many docs don't do marker tests but it maybe worth further discussing with MO due to nodule concern. I would also recommend a 2nd opinion if you don't feel comfortable with your MOs explanation.",

Cardiologists sent me for stress test this time and told me nothing wrong with your heart but I want you to see pulmonary as your exercise tolerance is very poor and slight increase in pulmonary pressure. Cat scan done. Found a number of nodules, small effusion and one enlarged lymph node. Biopsy on lymph node pos. for breast cancer. I am on letrazole and Ibrance. Node is down and fluid is gone. Nodules the same but now they are questioning if they are even cancer now, though they thought they were at first. Also to note I had a small effusion in 2011 when diagnosed stage 2. All assumed effusion was from pneumonia two months prior. Now wondering if it could of been metastatic all along and the tamoxifen helped to control it after the chemo and radiation..........onc not sure. I have a rare type of Breast cancer called invasive papillary carcinoma and it tends to be slow growing ( very rare for it to become metastatic).",

The lymph node is now back to normal after about 10 months on this tx. Nodules look basically the same. Onc says I am NED as she does not think the nodules are cancer. I am not totally sure on this so I am too nervous to feel real comfortable saying I am NED. But at the very least I am stable. I have been on this tx for a year now. Next scan is Oct 28th and I look forward to continue hearing good news😊 Praying for stability and NED for all of us! I was at a MBC conference over the weekend at Dana Farber in Boston. The head of the MBC program stated that he believed in the next 15 to 20 years MBC will no longer be a terminal illness. He stated that maybe this could also happen in 10 years but he felt pretty confident in at least 15 to 20.",

She further stated the SE should be easier on AC and therefore I was a little taken back when reading the posts on Breast cancer org stating that most people are tolerating the Taxol better. I also shared my concern around my heart with DF. I have a very strong history of heart disease in my family and experience chest pains when feeling under a great deal of stress and have High blood pressure. I saw a cardiologist that stated I had some arrythemia (sp?) but nothing to be concerned about and was basically healthy. DF stated they would not be concerned with what i have told them and do not usually become concerned until a person is over 55 with high blood pressure.  I am waiting for an appt here with the most recommended oncologist and will hear what she has to say. I am very confused myself but tend to trust DF.  I am very interested in hearing what you decide to do and your understanding of the data out there.  I am a 46 year old single mom of a 5 year old daughter that I take care of all by myself.

I am considering a disability retirement but have some fears around this and am not sure if it is the right thing to do. I am a single mother to a 9 year old girl. I am the sole giver in all aspects, financially, emotionally and day to day care. I am having a very hard time keeping up with work, the house,daughter's activities, all her needs, errands, my medical appts,etc. I am told I would receive about 60 percent of my salary through a disability retirement pension. I could also apply for social security but can not get a straight answer if SS benefits will be less cause of the pension. Nervous for many reasons. Can I manage financially on around 65 or 70 percent of my salary( still have a mortgage) and though I will be much less stressed, will miss the day to day connection at work and utilizing by brain and skill in my work. Will I get depressed and isolate? Will I ever be able to focus on other things besides the cancer if I don't work? Very unsure what to do. I wish I could work two days a week and collect the disability retirement. Does anyone have any thoughts or could share their experience if they took an early retirement? I don't have short or long term disability insurance that I have paid for separately. It would be disability pension and what I get from SS. I do have some money through a deferred comp and a small inheritance, but not very much.",

I have since researched this mutation and this seems to be a studied concern with functional medicine. There is belief that this mutation increases risk for cancer and cardiac problems among other things. However, from what I am reading by some NDs you have to be careful with Deplin and start very slow or you could have difficult side effects. Do you mind me asking your experience with the deplin?",

Last scan was two months ago and there appeared to be small progression on two lung nodules but the others were stable. Doc didn't want to wait 3 to 4 months for next scan so I just had one which was at 2 months. I am having a pretty difficult day. Very anxious of results and what they could mean.",

As others have said, ( and I know this can be really hard to do) remember to stay aware of your needs and ask for help. My prayers and thoughts are with you. This crap has got to stop soon!",
