I went to my GP and he ordered a mammo and ultrasound. They were negative and said I had a band of fibroglandular tissue. Fast forward to March, and I notice there are now several lumps in my breast going into my armpit and I have swelling around my armpit. I go back to the doctor and have a consult with the surgeon next week. I am wondering if anyone has a similar experience Log in to post a reply",
