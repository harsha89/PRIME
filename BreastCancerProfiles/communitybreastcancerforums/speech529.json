I have a strong family history--mom died of ovarian and two aunts with breast cancer not to mention a host of other epithelial cancers in my immediate and extended family.   I am very nervous.  I don' t know how painful it will be and how long my recovery will be.  I was a bit nervous prior to my hysterectomy but not like this.  Maybe because it's the second time in three weeks I will have major surgery.  I have recovered well from the other--I am out walking daily and have worked up to 2 miles a day for the past 4 days.  I feel great and hope I will do well with this surgery. I am a very positive person but I am feeling lots of anxiety about this.  Mostly about recovery, not the surgery.  ",

It was good to get back for the mental stimulation but I am not sleeping well (due to hot flashes) and by Thursday I am really tired.  My PS wrote me a scrip for Ambien and I have been sitting on it for almost a week.  I finally took one last night--woke up 3 times for hot flashes but fell asleep instantly and that horrid anxiety feeling was gone! I slept so well, really felt rested.  I plan to take it again on Wednesday night if I continue to have trouble sleeping all week. Today my hot flashes were much less--I only had two, one in the morning and one in the evening.  I usually have about 10-15 per day (no ovaries since 6/2/10).  I am hoping they are going away. I decided not to go on Evista as was recommended by the oncologist.  He was sort of on the fence about me going on something.  I have struggled with the hot flashes and they are so interfering and debilitating.  I just cannot imaging taking something to make MORE come.   Am I crazy?   I started exercising this week--doing some hiking, which is more fun than anything.  There is a trail up a mountain (it's really a foothill) near my house and I can watch the sunrise as I hike.  I tried a bit more--like some light weights (2 lbs) but I was so sore the next day.  I will just go hike or walk on the treadmill for now.  Maybe some swimming.  ",

My comment on implants:  I have Natrelle cohesive gel implants by Allergan.  My PS said that gummies were not approved by the FDA yet but she is hoping for it soon.  Perhaps your doctor has some sort of special approval to use them?  My implants feel and look very natural. It's been two months since my one step and my left breast looks awesome (its my natural breast) and my right \"foob\" is coming along, too.  It is less stiff now and beginning to move a little bit like the other one.  It feels natural.  My scars are fading...the mx scar looks lighter than the implant scar! The yoga retreat was wonderful--it is technically \"Holy Yoga\" which is true yoga but with a Christian focus.  I highly recommend yoga to you when your dr okays you to resume normal activity.  I was able to really stretch for the first time--I could not believe how tight my chest and shoulders were.  I participated in at least two yoga classes each day and even went on a 2 hour hike!  We swam and ate the most wonderful food!  Now that I am home, I am committed to going to Holy Yoga three times a week (just went tonight and it was invigorating).  Classes are free.  Holy Yoga has been around since 2005 and there are classes in many states and some parts of Canada.I feel so encouraged, that I am going to get back to my original strength!

Right now, just going up the stairs elevates my heart rate.   I am determined to get this DRAIN out asap.  They seem stuck at 28 and BS wants it down to 20 or less.  I just don't want to have to attend a week long workshop with this thing in me!  I am hoping to be able to get it out on Friday...but if not, I will deal with it. Ladies....sending out lots of loving thoughts to all of  you on this forum.  You have helped me so much by \"listening\" and encouragement and caring.  I know that when I get upset or discouraged that my sisters in cyberspace have been there and they understand.  That's a huge help.  Remember, your body is a miracle--with the help of our doctors we have hit this disease hard and now our bodies are healing.  ",

My dad will be here with me for this surgery as he was the last time.  He is a retired general surgeon and he performed mastectomies (along with many other procedures) in his practice years ago.  He dealt with many types of cancer and he was relieved that I opted for the mx rather than further lumpectomy and radiation.   Sending hugs, healing thoughts and best wishes to all!

I had a right mx with immediate reconstruction (silicon implants in both breasts).  The surgeons said the procedures went very well.  I woke up in recovery feeling so relieved that it was all over!  My pain has been much less than I thought it would be.  I had Vicodin and a muscle relaxant last night at 10 pm  and then at 1 am I needed a bit more.  They gave me a morphine, which helped so much (I slept 4 hours after that).  I did not need any more pain meds until about 11 am today--they gave me Toredol (sp?) IV and that took the edge off the pain.  My PS said I could shower today but I had to return the foam dressing and put on the mx bra and keep it tight.  I have a Jackson-Pratt drain and it is not as difficult as I thought it would be. So I am on my way to recovery land!  I will stay one more night here at Mayo and then I will be home.  I look forward to the day when I am back to normal!

My own questions--I have one drain and so far the amount draining has decreased each day from 120 to 75 to 45 yesterday.  It is still red--kind of like cranberry juice color.  I thought it would change color along with getting less.  I am spending most of my time in bed or sitting/lying on the couch.  How far down should the drain hang for maximum drainage?  I thought it was the suction action that does most of the job of getting fluids out. Another concern I have: the nipple on the mx side is darker than usual--probably a bruise.  My breast tissue around this area is reddish but it does not hurt (of course not, the whole breast is numb).  I am not sure what is something to be concerned about.  I know they told me if it's hot and painful, to call the dr. I don't know if it's red due to the pressure on it...The incision looks fine, no swelling or drainage.  This is all new territory...anyone else go through these changes that are concerning but normal? Happy Canada Day to our neighbors to the North....Happy July 4th.  Have a great weekend!",

Jeanne--It is so hard to do this with help I can't imagine how difficult it is alone.  I am glad you shared your heart here because I know each lady cares and if we could we'd come and hug you.  I know what you mean about shopping--I cannot push the cart either and it's tiring to walk around the grocery store.  You've been through so much and I think you have to take time and grieve.  I think we all have had those moments.  Whatever you go through is your reality compared with your life prior to the diagnosis.  It's hard. Period.  So cry and then do the next thing you need to do to beat the tar out of this disease!  I hope you have a good night's rest and God blesses you in a special way! MRDRN I hope you can get a good, healing rest.  That's another good medicine.  Good for you on the gardener...I hired a maid to come in 2x a month.  What a luxury.  I think I will keep her even after I go back to work.  Reneemac amazing you are doing so much...that's a workout!  I hope your work/time off issues resolve to your benefit.   Joystars your positive attitude amidst the loss is inspiring.  Lizzy I have had a decreased appetite, also...my DH has to remind me to eat sometimes.  I don't know what it is.  Maybe lack of activity?  I am such a food hound--you and I share some favorite foods--I love GUMMY BEARS and chips/salsa.  My only craving during this recovery has been for spinach salad with Greek-style grilled chicken breast.   Laurie  your pain med story was funny but I am glad you were able to get a refill. My dad is a retired general surgeon (back in the day he performed radical mx's) and he said that people in pain process the meds differently than if they have no pain.  He said risk of addiction is small if you are truly in pain and you stop when you are no longer in pain.  He told me there was no reason for me to be in pain--to take meds as I needed them.    Sounds like your spa day was great...I plan to do that when I get back from my trip. jblcsw Congrats on your drains being out....I got my drain out today too and I feel so much better!  I hope you heal successfully...it's so hard because it is so out of the norm, because it is you and it is scary.  Take good care of yourself! So on to Tamoxifen etc....I met with my oncologist today--I went in there thinking that he was going to go over path reports and then shake my hand and tell me goodbye...not so.  Turns out he recommended some chemical prevention.  We talked about Tamoxifen and Raloxifine.  The latter was developed out of Tamoxifen for treatment of osteoporosis.   Since I don't have a uterus or ovaries, I will be on Raloxifine (if I choose to take this assignment).  So I need to do some research here.  I thought I was done...guess not. I have never heard of Raloxifine.  I hope you all have some special joy this weekend! I am leaving on 7/11 to Philadelphia for the professional workshop that I applied to attend in February.  I am so excited to be going somewhere as a regular person and not a patient!!!   I will try to check in while I am in Philly...but for sure when I get back. Lots of love and hugs to all of you! ",

My PCP prescribed this for me, too.  I thought I would do some research about it and one item was of concern for me:  getting off Effexor is difficult for some people physiologically.  I have also read that doses need to be increased to be as effective as when it was started.  Even with the very low dose that is prescribed for hot flashes.  At Mayo (where I am treated), Effexor is recommended for managing hot flashes.   So my question is...what do you know about this drug and its effect on the brain?  What do you know about its physiological effect on the brain and body over the long term?  I would love to get hot flashes to stop--just not sure if this is the way for me.   stlcrdsfan  My hot flashes have eased up since my oopherectomy on 6/2.  I stopped hormones on 3/27 and had a major increase in HFs for a couple of weeks.  Then they waned a bit and became more manageable.  Then I had the ooph on 6/2 and within a week back again.  Now I am only having maybe 1-2 a day if that.  I am 51 and probably was about halfway to menopause when I had the hysterectomy with BSO.  I have also noticed triggers for my HFs...high sugar foods (ice cream, cake), dark red wines, stress, thinking about stressful things, fatigue, heat sources. Look forward to hearing about what you ladies know about Effexor---some of you are great at research and have the ability to dig up important facts quickly. May you be blessed you all with something wonderful today!! Sending my love and hugs to all....what would I do without my sisters?",

It is a great sorrow for me--I was blessed with a very wonderful MIL and I love her so much--the last time I saw her was 2006.   I wanted to go see her in Nov 2010 with my husband, but my boss would not let me off work since I had taken two months in the summer for my surgical recovery.  I understood her point of view at the time, thinking that I would be able to see my MIL sometime this year.  Don't wait to do what you really want to do!!   We are having some gorgeous weather here in Phoenix...hopefully it will stay this way for the rest of May.  I am dreading the summer again.  I really wanted to go on trip (e.g. relaxing vacation) somewhere this summer to get out of the heat, but it's not going to happen.  I will be spending my vacation time moving my daughter to MA. **sigh** At least it will be out of the heat, right?

The workshop was great--but it took all I had to stay awake in the afternoons! The way this event was set up, we stayed in a dormitory on the UPenn campus and then had to walk to the conference site (about a half mile) each day.   I experienced alot of swelling in my breasts intermittently and it seemed related to the amount of activity I did.  When I rested, the swelling went away.  Even my \"real\" breast that was augmented swelled.  Anyone experience this when they over did it? I just got back to Phoenix about 2 hours ago and my breasts are beginning to settle down after the airplane trip.  I have one more week off to recover and then I go back to work on July 26.   I hope I can do this!  I am a speech pathologist and I work with very young children. Blessings to you all!  Going to go to bed now!  Hurray--my own bed!",

My health is good, and life is, too. At the time of my surgery, our two daughters were in college. They are now on their own--one is a very successful history teacher, happily married. The other is a talented critical care/trauma nurse. I am still working full time in speech-language pathology and blessed with the stamina to keep up with my tiny clients! My DH retired a few years ago so he now takes care of all the household duties--lucky me!! We are traveling several times a year--our passion is hiking. We leave in a few days for a hiking trip to Colorado. Hopefully we'll get to do another 14er. There are times when I stop and think about diagnosis, treatment and recovery--it was a lot to go through. I go for annual mammo on the left breast. I don't see an oncologist but sometimes wonder if I should. I never did radiation or tamoxifen. Hope the mammo was enough to kick the a** of DCIS.  God bless you all ",

Hugs and prayers to all of you as you face this battle.",

It has been 10 days since my surgery and all went very well.  I had a Rmx with immediate reconstruction.  I still have a drain and hope I can get it removed in a couple of days.  I am healing very well and thankful I was able to get home the day after surgery.  I just love being in my own bed and being at home in familiar surroundings.  One word of advice:  don't hesistate to ask your family and/or friends for help.  Allow yourself to be pampered (this is hard for me, but I am learning!! ). God bless you all!  Lots of hugs and love",
