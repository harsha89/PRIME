My skin is falling off in my cleavage, but I finished full breast today, so I'm hoping to see an improvement soon. Five boosts begin tomorrow, and I'm done next Wednesday. Absolutely not a walk in the park, but I'm making it. I read of everyone's different experiences, and I think we are awesome!",

I changed doctors two years ago and she tested my vitamin D level for the first time in my life (at 55). It was 7. I didn't even know what that meant, except that the report indicated a range of 40-60 as normal. I was probably deficient for years, but didn't know it. Not fully understanding the impact the deficiency might have, I half heartedly took the vitamin D she prescribed, and got my level up to 27. Two months later, I was diagnosed with DCIS. The first thing my surgeon said was that she wanted me tested, and I was able to tell her that my level was 27 two months prior. She flipped and said I should be over 60, and put me on a 50,000 IU monthly and has me taking the 2,000 IU daily that the GP had prescribed. I get tested again in August. Now, I also have become evangelical about D. I think that contributed to my Cancer.  I will tell anyone who will listen to have their's checked and to keep it up there. BTW:  I feel ten years younger! All the aches and pains I blamed on our matress were in my body to begin with. Power on, ladies!",

I have to admit that it is a relief to see that other people are freaked out by the treatments. I know it is helping, but it made me cry and hyperventilate the first day. I'm afraid that if I breath, I'll get zapped in the wrong place. Yesterday, I took two Advil before going in to see if that helped, and I asked them to turn off the country music blasting in the backround. Then I practiced creative visualization of a fond memory and refused to let my mind wander to the machine. It was definitely better. I also take my own sweat shirt to wear while waiting instead of a hospital gown. It makes me feel better, not sick. I haven't been told about skin stuff yet, but I'm so glad to have this forum to just come back to and not feel so alone. Thanks for being there and good luck to us all! Fight like girls!",
