In July 2011, a mammo and ultrasound detected a lump on left breast.  I decided to have a bilateral mastectomy with tram flap reconstruction.  I was ER+, PR- and HER2+.  I too don't understand why I'm ER+ and had been on Tamox, Arimidex and Aromasin almost 5 years!  My second cancer is considered a primary with no node involvement.  My right breast appeared to be perfectly healthy after the treatment received in 2006 but it had to go!  I just finished chemo and the Taxatere/carboplatin really kicked my butt!  Will be seeing oncologist next week to discuss going on Tamoxifen again!!!!  Hang in there......it is hard but we CAN do it!",
