It definately is more grey than I anticipated but I feel I will embrace it and keep it that way.  It is salt and peppery.  I just tell people its grey from the chemo and maybe it is!!  It is very soft. I wore my bald head proudly.  It was an external symbol of what was/am going through.  People who had gone through or know of someone who had gone thru what we are going thru would stop and give me hugs and support.  It was nice.  You can't see this disease and somehow the baldness let others know what was going on. I will kind of sort of miss being bald!!  It certainly was easy to wash!!!.  Now when I wear a hat(mostly RED SOX or PATRIOTS caps)  I have hat head!!!  I wear the caps to keep my head warm on the cold/cool days.  Otherwise there is no hat, especially if I am having a flash. I don't know if any of that makes sense or helps but there it is.  Truly, for me, losing my hair was the least of my worries.",
