      "Content": "Sep 8, 2013 04:54PM poodle_mum wrote: I was re-reading some of the posts (now that I'm on my computer instead of my phone). I think things were hard for me because I actually volunteered to have the preventative mastectomy done (this from someone who can't even stand the sight of a needle). So when I went in for my first appointment, I had a different mind-set. His comment about he doesn't do any surgical procedure without a recent mammogram that suddenly changed to \"you don't need a mammogram, I'm taking everything out\" just left me confused. Now I have to say, I am Deaf (I can follow a simple conversation one on one - which thankfully this doctor has limited communication skills LOL to my benefit).  When I had surgery, and pre-op, etc. I had an interpreter with me the full time. In his office, I don't bother. I'm never there for more than 15/20 minutes and since the man barely says anything, I figure it's not worth it. (Plus, I do understand his nurse at the office) Then I get my \"Day Surgery\" package (which surprised me since I thought I would be at least in the hospital more than one day). They scheduled the surgery while I was at his office for 8 days later. Then I called to book my pre-op appt and they told me they had to change my surgery date for another 13 days because they doctor requested a longer opening time for the OR. I was still going on the \"Ok, this is just a preventative thing, I've seen pictures on the internet, I can handle this, no problem.....\" As I walked into the hospital and asked the first lady I saw where Day Surgery was, she said, \"oh come walk with me, that's where I'm going.\" We only walked a few feet (my parents had driven me as it was in another town and I don't drive) and all of a sudden I blurted out \"I'm tired of hearing how hard it is for everyone else to cope with this, THEY aren't getting their boobs lopped off!\" She turned to me and said \"*I* know exactly how you feel, I've been through it myself.  I'll be part of your nursing team and when you've finished the pre-op things, I'll come and talk to you.\" It was just like this angel had put her arm around my shoulder. So I went through all the pre-op.  At one point in time another nurse popped in and actually really caused me alarm.  She said \"so is this is a breast reduction, a mastectomy, are you intending to keep your breasts, what is the purpose of this, why would you want to have this done.....\" and a whole lot of other quick jabbing questions that just left me speechless.  Soon afterwards, the original nurse came back, sat down and took my hand and I was in tears.  She had heard the other nurse and had actually asked her from outside the room to stop the questions.  I could understand her without my interpreter so that helped a lot too.  First she asked me if I was volunteering to have a preventative mastectomy. I said yes. She asked if anyone had coerced me or if it was my own free will. I told her I wanted it done because I had a strong history of BC in the family. I told her that someone told me a \"real\" mastectomy meant that I had to lose everything from my underarms, breasts, chest wall, every single thing. She asked me if I had the lymph nodes in the underarm areas tested and I said yes everything was fine. She said then I didn't need to worry. So I told her that I wanted to keep my nipples.  She smiled and said that was perfectly natural. She explained that the surgeon's report said there was concern in my left breast and she said they would probably have to do a lot more work on that side because there was obviously something there, it could be a lump or a cyst or something, but he wanted to make sure that he got everything out. So I asked her does this mean I have cancer? She told me not to think about that, she would see me in a few days and everything would be fine. When I came out of surgery, she was there - the nurses were surprised he didn't put in drains as well, but apparently he said he saw no reason for putting them in. He then said (through my interpreter) that he had taken everything out,  all was clear and he got clean margins. I looked at my nurse and I saw her facial expression change. To make an extremely long story short(er) (if possible), before I left the hospital I sat down with her again and talked with her. She said, obviously she didn't have the information about what may or may not have been found. They did run into some complications with the left side. They took out all the breast tissue (including other more specified terms that I can't recall), they used my own fatty tissue to create boobs and as promised they were able to keep small nipples too and everything looked like real boobs (or at least would eventually when all the swelling was gone, etc.) She said for him to speak that confidently, she knew he had taken everything that he would have taken in a preventative mastectomy but made sure that he had not missed anything that was questionable. That's when one of the other nurses who had been in the OR with us said \"yes, he definitely went on a fishing expedition!\" (They all understand my sense of humour). (Ironically, *my nurse* (as I've come to call her) has his PS partner who will be starting her reconstruction surgery in a few weeks so she knows this surgeon quite well.) She told me not to worry, everything would be fine and it might be a bit of time but I would eventually get a written report of everything that would include the \"questionable\" complication. So from my understanding, what he said, is that (again in simplified terms because I did not have an interpreter there that day during the appt after surgery), \"technically you have no breasts but I kept the skin and the nipples and made you nicely shaped breasts that will make you feel better.\" I'm starting to feel different sensations like sudden sharp pin feelings but the nurse said that was nerves connecting and part of the healing process. Sorry for being long-winded. I've had no one to talk to and I think my friends are getting tired of the \"show and tell\" and constant \"boob talk\" but, they just don't understand what I'm feeling.",

Since it was again only a 15/20 minute check up, I didn't get an interpreter. I will for sure when he tells me he wants a longer appointment.  So what I got from him today from my speech-reading and the nurse clarifying parts afterwards was that there were cancer cells in very early stage in milk ducts (I think he said) and he pointed to the area which was \"complicated\" which I gather meant was the area he found them. So I'm still not sure of the accurate terminology.  He said that it was a smart idea to decide on preventative mastectomy when I did because it would have been more serious and much treatment involved at a later time, but I had nothing to worry about right now. He had the nurse explain that I'm supposed to do massage and how to do it and she did say since I still have a seroma it may re-open but not to worry, it is not a big issue, put some gauze on it and it will do it's thing. I hope I don't sound extremely naiive but I'm actually feeling more relief.  All the tape is off as of today so for the first time I really did get a look at what is there and even though I thought I'd be ready (since I've had glimpses through the tape and when they've changed it), I'm still not.  They said within a few months, my tissue will shift, once all the swelling goes down and they will look really good. A friend suggested I just avoid looking at them in a mirror because seeing them is bothering me and we want me to move forward. Please let me know if I'm posting in the wrong place here. My mind still hasn't really overcome all the confusion, information and procedures over the past month. He said that he doesn't need to see me for another month and just let nature do it's job.",

From what I understand it's to increase blood flow and also to help the fluid re-absorb into the body better. The nurse showed me, it's basically like a self breast exam but then she showed me on my upper arm the pressure to use. Holy crow! I'm only 3 weeks post-op this Thursday - still in pain - well at least in the areas that still have sensation. I think because parts have no sensation it might make my brain think the other parts hurt worse than they do. But I seriously need advice on this so if someone can direct me into the right thread or direction, I'd really appreciate it. It just seems they want me doing everything so soon. I spent the first week trying not to pass out when sitting up and trying to sit in my power chair (I have a spinal cord injury). I can't use my manual until everything is healed. Now he says at least 30 minutes outside twice a day in my power chair (I have a service dog so that motivates me there) - but he has no clue how much sidewalk bumps hurt no matter how slow you try to go over them. Ok that part was my venting. But yes, if anyone can help with how to deal with the massage issue I'd greatly appreciate it.",

      "Content": "Sep 11, 2013 11:08PM poodle_mum wrote: Lisa - I was just thinking about you and wanted to update you (and everyone else).  I did get a little more information today. The diagnosis is DCIS, I'm not sure how many ducts were affected although if I look online a bit more, I can probably figure it out since I know the exact area that the surgeon showed me (quite a few times) where he called the \"complications.\"  From what I was told, it was only found on the left breast which would explain why the doctor kept emphasising \"complications\" on the left side and basically ignoring any questions about the right breast.  Since I had a total mastectomy, that was why he said he had no concerns because he was able to take everything out.  Also, I was told that had I waited even a few years before considering a mastectomy based on the \"preventative\" theory, it would have been invasive and I would have required chemo and radiation which is why he said that I made the best choice for the surgery at the perfect time. After looking in the mirror after coming home from the doctor's appt yesterday, I was absolutely devastated and just can't bear the sight of things.  My friend and my Mum (as well as the doc and nurse) say everything looks really good.  That's fine and dandy for them, to me, these breasts are completely foreign objects, despite them having used the skin sparing method (and the nipple re-attachment) and using my own fatty tissue. I looked in the mirror - these aren't my breasts. So I'm not going to look at them for a while.  I did feel around to see where I have sensation and I also noticed just this morning that since the seroma leaked last week through the re-constructed areola, I had thought I had no nipple on that side because I hadn't seen it before - but this morning some of the scabbing came off and low and behold, there is a nipple, but I didn't look to see what it actually looked like. As far as the massage therapy.  I got proper instructions on how it needs to be done, how often and why. The nurse did show me but there was so much to take in yesterday and with the communication barrier, my brain was in overload.  So the massage therapy is for several purposes I was told.  One, to increase blood flow, particularly around the nipple and on the nipple since those were re-attached (originally the left nipple was black and I think there was some concern that there wasn't proper blood flow but it is indeed \"working\" now).  It is also to try to loosen the hardened parts of the seromas (yes there is one on both breasts - I thought only the left because it \"exploded\" LOL - but that was the \"accordion\" issue on the right side).  It will also help with scar tissue and ironically reduce pain (I guess this is where the term \"no pain, no gain\" comes in?) So after getting the proper instructions on method, etc. I lightly did the massage therapy.  I thought my brain was freaked out enough by the mirror yesterday.  That was nothing compared to today.  On the top where the \"new breasts\"  - that's what they are, right? I can feel a softer tissue that feels similar to my \"old breasts\".  (Sorry, this is so emotional for me)  Around the right side on the right breast where the accordion is, I could feel the seroma, hard like a rock - there is a tiny hole that leaked (they had said this would happen, and if there was a lot of drainage, slap some gauze on it and let it do it's thing, right?) but it was just a tiny bit.  Then I did the left breast.  Since it opened at the ribcage last Tuesday, it has completely scabbed over. But omg, there is a lump there the size that feels at least 4 cm deep and about the same width - of course, I realise, this is part of the seroma. But that freaked me out. I wasn't expecting that.  When they originally found the seroma two weeks ago it was 10cm long (part was soft, part was hard) and probably about 2-4 cm wide depending on the area with the deepest part 2cm so I was not expecting this.) Part of the left areola is soft and part of it has a lump - so that's probably where the seroma leaked and then the skin closed on it. I need to do the massage therapy three times a day - takes about 15 minutes (I only did it once today and then a sort of mini-edition - very lightly) with a fair amount of pressure.  If I don't, I could have the opposite effect of things - greater swelling, more seroma issues and healthwise put myself deep into a pit. So I'll build up to it over the next few days and by next week I've promised myself to follow through with what they've said.  They said the massage therapy will last possibly 3 months or so. I told my friend I'm definitely doing the therapy topless (away from a mirror of course) because I have this apocalyptic image of boob explosion! LOL So that's it in a LONG nutshell.  I'm scared out of my wits by what I've seen and felt in the past 24 hours. I feel like some foreigner has invaded me.   At the same time I have great relief knowing that my choice for the mastectomy due to family history was the best choice I've ever made in my life and I'm so very lucky and grateful to have had it done.  I look at it from so many different perspectives. I look at it by saying this has potentially saved my life. He did do the lymph node biopsies while in there (that part still hurts like a son of a gun, as you ladies who've been through it know). I didn't know that was going to happen, but I guess once they went in and discovered the DCIS they wanted to make sure they had covered all the bases and I'm eternally grateful for that. My life has changed so much, so quickly. And I feel guilty complaining about it when I'm sitting here in a position where the only treatment I need is the massage therapy which is peanuts compared to what most of you ladies are experiencing now and in the near future. I feel like such a wimp when I read the stories of so many of you ladies and those on the other threads who have braved and will brave through and fight so hard. I feel like I got a \"free pass\". Thank you for your suggestion to find out more information and get a better understanding of things due to the communication barrier.  I also now understand why when I went into the OR, the one whole wall was a long table with tons of technological devices, I've grateful that they had the ability to check things right then and there. That also explains why my surgery was 4 hours long when he said it could be 2.5 to 3 hours. Thank you again ladies for listening to me ramble. My friends don't understand, although Lord love them, they are all trying and are very supportive.",

Call me a dipstick or brave but I walked over (power chair of course) to the dollar store across the street. Average time for what I did would generally be 20 minutes tops (My poodle always has to inspect all the grass on his way to the store - according to Google maps which does not include poodle-time, the walk there and back is 10 minutes and you can go a heck of a lot faster in a chair). I went in, told the lady what I was looking for and she went and got it and checked me out. Total time from leaving home to returning? 1.5 hours - BUT - I did it! I was really feeling the effects of things by the time I was 3/4 way home. I know, not exactly at the top of the list of things to do alone especially when I'm still having issues with light-headedness aside from the pain. One more piece of news - tonight I will get my first full bath in 3 weeks! I'm excited. I'm not sure about the water temperature because my attendant knows where I usually like it set but they said the water cannot be hot. I'm a bit scared the water will loosen the scabbing and re-open the hole at my ribcage so I'll set aside gauze dressings before the bath just in case. I'm so excited about the bath! :-D Any advice on water temperature? One of the downfalls of a spinal cord injury. Oh well, that's life. :-D",

You know how I had mentioned the huge 4cm lump part of the seroma? It's beside the incision site to the right. The hole at my ribcage that opened two weeks ago is to the left of the incision site. Anyway, while doing the massage I noticed the scabbing was coming off. The tissue underneath to an untrained eye looks like infection but I know from experience with other wounds it is just raw tissue so even though it looks disgusting, it's ok. So I'm doing the therapy and all of a sudden I felt \"pop pop pop\" - you know like when you're playing with the bubble packing that you put in boxes? Freaked me out. I guess it is the seroma breaking down. I sure hope this isn't going to be a reoccurring experience. I'm up to my 3x daily therapy but not at full pressure and I'm handling it. I did however ask my gp for Demerol. I don't take narcotics. Even after my surgery I only took Tramadol for four days and that was it. Once I started the therapy I decided to go ahead and ask for the Demerol. My doc knows if I'm asking, then I'm in agony. So I take it at night because I find that I'm in more pain by then and even my regular sleeping pills have been having no effect on me. Anyway, I'm truly hoping this therapy does not cause me to feel like a bloody popcorn machine everyday! I know it couldn't be the stitches that are inside - sutures don't feel like a popcorn machine. I've found that using Steri-strips that close over a wound but still let it drain if need be have come in handy. Fluid can drain out, nothing can get in. So I just woke up and noticed that tissue exposed so I put the Steri-strip over it. That will help it heal plus if my popcorn boob decides to drain I'll be safe and can slap some gauze over it. I had a decubitus ulcer (pressure sore) on my right forearm years ago that ended up being 4\" wide and 6\" long and actually ate through part of my muscle. I had it for almost 4 years. At one point it stopped draining and started closing which caused a seroma near my elbow that was the size of a softball. The ER doc did a one inch cut, drained it and within 6 months the entire ulcer was almost healed. So at least I have some experience with that part of things. But this popcorn effect? Still freaking me out. Thankfully my Mum has volunteered to take my little guy for the day and my goal is to pass out for the day - lol. Hope you other ladies are doing alright with your recovery. Lisa, did they take that drain yet? I've been pretty sick since Thursday night so I haven't had a chance to catch up. My bath was beautiful but within 10 minutes afterwards I thought my world was going to end and been pretty sick since which I mostly blame on this stupid therapy. Well that's enough whining. Mum will be here in an hour to get Jr. I'm going to get some anti-nausea pills and as soon as he tells me he's leaving, I'm crashing and heaven help anyone who rings me and wakes me - I'll wring their necks!

There have been other family emergencies that have been keeping me pre-occupied. I just let the hole do it's thing and focus on the other issues. I have managed to get out with the little guy a bit more. Not as much as I'd like but I'm handling the sidewalks much better. I really have a problem wearing a sports bra because the band comes to where the hole is and even though it's bandaged, the band causes discomfort. With all the extra family issues happening I missed two days of therapy. When I did it last night I noticed several new lumps so I have to get back on top of that and at least do it every morning while in bed and then if possible go back to sleep and then again every night when I lay down before I go to sleep. My sleep is still sporadic but that could just be stress. On the upside the pain has diminished to occasional discomfort. I can sleep part of the night on my side which is nice. And I've raised almost $500 for the CIBC Run for the Cure on October 6th. Going to try to go back to sleep.

At the same time it is her mother who is in the hospital and is basically just waiting for her day to go over the Rainbow Bridge.  Mentally she is sharp as a whip but her 92 year old body is just giving out.  She has been through hell and back this year and she's tired of everything.  She wants to go home to her own home and just let nature take it's course and I can't say I blame her at all. I'm just so exhausted. Oh regarding scars - my friend's baby had heart surgery when he was 6 weeks old and she said once his incision was healed, she put Vitamin E on it and it's barely visible - he is 3 now.",

      "Content": "Sep 22, 2013 03:02PM poodle_mum wrote: Jennylee - I feel what you are saying. I had my surgery exactly one month ago today. I had a bilateral mastectomy with a skin sparing and they were able to re-attach my nipples (or at least create as best as they could using what they took off). I did not have artifical implants, they just used my own tissue so that I could at least have some girls when all was said and done. My incisions healed well on my right side. My left side was a bit more complicated through surgery, I had DCIS and there was a lot more work done on the left side.  My problem is that I developed a seroma (first on the left side, then a few days later a smaller one on my right).  The seroma decided to start draining from the areola on the left and then it also broke the skin below, partly through the incision and then went further on.  I've had it checked for infection and they say it is ok.  It is about 3cm in length now, 1cm in width and 1/2cm in depth at one particular point. It is draining, which is good, because it is caused by the seroma.  However the skin around it is quite inflamed (despite the reassurance that there is no infection). I do not need chemo or radiation, as they were able to get everything out.  However, I am required to do breast massage therapy three times daily (I admit lately due to a whirlwind of family emergencies, I've become lax and when I began again two nights ago, I realised the importance of maintaining this therapy).  The massage therapy is to maintain blood flow in the breast, particularly to the nipples/areolas as they were re-attached. The right side did really well and pinked up within days whereas the left one was a bit of a question as it was more blackish at first, then after a week went to purple. It is greatly scabbed due to the drainage but the new skin that has begun to grow is coming in a pinkish colour, so I'm quite grateful for that.  Another reason for the massage therapy is to try to break down the seromas which have actually increased this past week (no doubt to my negligence, as I now have one roughly 3cm round and 1cm deep under my left areola) as well as several small but new ones on my right side.  This definitely aggravates the opening at the incision and ribcage because that is where the largest seroma is, with one being 4cm round and roughly 3-4cm deep directly on the opposite side of the incision. So the benefit of the therapy will be to try to get those to re-absorb into the body or most likely in that particular area, it wil drain from the hole.  The other reason for the massage therapy is to try to prevent build up of scar tissue as there was so much work done in that area (as we all know, this surgery is not a walk in the park). My incisions were closed by disolving stitches, both inside and out. When I asked the doctor how many stitches (I always want as much detail as possible, he said there were too many to give me even an estimated guess).  Was your incision closed by stitches or staples? Has the surgeon checked the incision site to eliminate infection?  Do you still keep dressings on the incision site? I must go for now but I will be back later.",

I'm able to eat a few of those a day. Lol)   I go back on Tuesday so we'll see what he has to say then.  The only positive thing is if he has to go back in,  I'll be prepared for the aftermath whereas this time I flew in blind and couldn't imagine anything worse.  Congrats to Jo for the good news.  I have a friend who was diagnosed with uterine cancer,  had her surgery the last week of September and by last week she was basically back to her normal life,  cancer-free with no extra treatments.  While I'm happy for her,  I'm also jealous (I know that sounds terrible). I'm 2 months and my goal to be well is January.  That does sound selfish as we all have different obstacles.   I got angry at myself today for thinking that all she has is a scar and go back in 6 months for a check-up and I lost so much.   Yet then I think of some of you wonderful ladies who probably think the same think about me because I was one of the \"lucky\" ones that didn't get drains and chemo.  I don't know. This world we were thrown into is just so messed up.  Ok,  I realise I'm still venting ",

My weight is staying steady. My main source of \"food\" is the shakes that are similar to Ensure (I found one I really like and they work well. On days I can't take in anything else I use the +calories one). That has kept up my weight. I also have been eating the All-bran bars by Kelloggs but now that my taste buds are finally coming back, no matter what the \"flavour\" is listed on it, they all taste like paper! Ugh - so I'm not eating much of those. Apparently one of the issues of my nausea is caused from the anesthetic because of my size (being so small), plus I was under for 1.5 hours longer than they expected as well as the fact that I'm in a chair. Apparently if you can walk, it helps \"walk off the anesthetic\" faster. I've tried several times to eat different things, all without success. The anti-nausea meds they have me on are supposed to help but ironically it says \"must take with food\". Uh, if I could eat the food, I wouldn't need the meds. I also often need them before taking some of the other meds they have me on now. The good thing is, I am feeling better. I manage about 4 hours of \"real life\" a day, I don't pass out anymore - it's been over a month since I passed out and that was during therapy - I was sitting up when I was doing it and I guess the pain was too much. The next day I told the doc and he kind of laughed and said \"don't do it sitting up, you'll bump your head!\" So I always do it laying down but still oh so painful. He agreed the Cheetos don't count as solid food!! LOL So today was my check-up, I'm now at 3 weeks (this is my second time having a two week break from the doc). My last check-up they scheduled on the wrong day so my nurse wasn't there and the nurse that was with me, when I walked in the room said \"is this your first time here?\" I looked at her like she was from outer space - uhh, no, I've practically lived here and at the hospital for the past 3 months!! Today my nurse was there and thought I had missed my last appt. When I told her what happened, she had a good laugh. Anywho, two good pieces of news. The left hole is healing from the inside but he still doesn't like something about the incision line (he didn't elaborate which was fine). He finally looked at the right side that I've asked him about twice so far and he used that tool that takes off the outside skin and apparently one of the problems was that last remaining suture never dissolved and it is what has been causing my hell. So he opened it up enough (not cutting it because he likes the incision line), pulled out the stitch and hopefully all the fluid that has been building up under my arm and on that side will now drain properly. Before it was opening and closing and just dripping a bit every few days. So I'm really happy about that! (Isn't it weird the things that excite us?) Now, my second piece of good news. When I got back to town I was complaining to my Mum about wanting to eat, but everything is too heavy (even canned soup). Then I said, you know, I'd like to get some chicken but I can't cook it. We stopped at the grocery store and I bought two full sized rotisserie cooked chickens. Then I got some minestrone soup mix and went over and saw the frozen veggies and saw something called Season Asian Blend (has beans, broccoli and a whole bunch of other stuff but nothing heavy). I had no idea what the heck it was going to taste like or even if I could eat it. I came home and ripped the chickens apart. Then I put double water into my big cooking pot and the soup mix, dumped the frozen veggies in and threw in a whole bunch of chicken that I shredded smaller. I also can't eat bread (obviously, because it's heavy) but I saw this \"flat bread\" that you could fold to make a sandwich like a pita, but I thought, hey, if I just pull this apart I get a thin piece of bread that's 4\" round, 1/4\" thick and it was seasoned with rosemary and olive oil. So I took the plunge. The soup was divine! I actually ate two bowls and two pieces of the bread. I wasn't sick, I didn't take the meds for anti-nausea because I wanted to see if I could eat the food. It was fantastic. My \"first food\" since the middle of August!!! And very high in protein and fibre (so you know what *that* means - boy that felt wonderful too! LOL). I had my friend come over and ladle out the extras into plastic containers so I can freeze them. I'm going to separate the bread tomorrow and the extra chicken and wrap them well and freeze them. That way I can pull out one a day. I might even find another bag of different veggies to make a variety of soup. My Mum also bought some cookies that are high in fibre and low in sugar (I get enough sugar with the shakes) and I can eat them without being sick so she's going to grab some more :-) This is the first day I've felt REALLY good. My doc also told me not to think about what may or may not be in the future, let's focus on right now and get me healthy and healed up. It probably won't be til January or so before we discuss the next step and he said that it was okay, it was not a rush issue. As for my friend who had the other surgery. I guess I was just feeling jealous. I also have a very close friend who is fighting an aggressive brain tumour. They were not able to get it all and she's gone through radiation and chemo. She had her MRI about a month ago and they told her she needs more aggressive chemo 5 times over a month for 5 months. I was talking to a mutual friend on Friday whose mother passed away from uterine cancer because it was discovered too late. She taught me a very important lesson and today when I saw her I gave her a big hug and thanked her. She said as far as she is concerned, it doesn't matter what kind of cancer you have, what your treatments are, the important thing is that you are alive and fighting. She said everyone has to fight their own fight and no one can be compared to the other. (Yes, I know, you've been trying to tell me that for months now!) :-) Everyone of you ladies is in my heart and my prayers and I'm so glad that I have this chance to talk with you, despite the situation that brought us together. Sorry for the extremely long post :-)",

I was the only one \"recent\" - one other girl went through it last year. And others are survivors of many years - the woman in charge is a 12 year survivor. I'm getting so used to seeing people in our position when I have my appts, I've sort of forgotten what life is like without it - if that makes any sense. It was nice to look around the room and see all these ladies who have walked in our shoes and where they are now. The other girl who just went through it last year looks quite a bit younger than me (I'm 40 and look like I'm 30). She also had to go through the massage therapy and she said it was hell for her too. I felt bad that she had to go through it but felt good that someone there knew what I was feeling. That probably sounds strange. BUT I'm proud to say I was able to eat one of those fancy sandwiches, a baby carrot, a slice of celery and a small slice of watermelon!!! And 2 cups of tea. It was nice. I couldn't understand the speakers but that was ok. It just felt nice to be there and seeing these ladies and thinking - you'd never know they went through this. Some day soon I'll be one of those ladies. Word has spread around my apt building and when people see me they always ask the same question - how are you doing? But you can see them walking on eggshells, you know? And people are so used to seeing me outdoors and with Dayton - then these past 2.5 months I've almost disappeared. They don't know what to say to me and I've known them for years. I suppose on the opposite side, I'd be the same way. Well, heading out with Dayton soon and another early night. I'm wiped out! Thinking of all you ladies and keeping you in my prayers. We're fighters, nothing can get us down, no matter how hard it might try! Big hugs to everyone",

Sick Kids in Toronto would get their kosher food from Mt Sinai Hospital across the street (underground tunnels connect all the hospitals in those blocks), so as far as my Dad was concerned the food should be the same as what he got at the cafeteria. I think he just used the excuse to go through the tunnels! :-) I loved it though because I got whatever it was that they had put on the plate, plus the pastrami sandwich from Mt Sinai. Of course Dad would always \"forget\" to buy two so he'd have to go back to get another one for himself. On the serious side - hope you get that test done and I'm praying for you for clear results. KBee, hope they get things better for you so you can head home - that insurance thing is ridiculous - inpatient/outpatient what they will pay. For heaven's sake!

The hole at my ribcage has re-opened and it has almost a 1cm red inflammation around it. I'm praying it's not an infection but I have been pretty nauseous the past two days and I've slept more since Friday than I even did after the surgery. I'm thinking in the morning to take the dressing I put on it off and take a picture and email it to him. That would give him an idea of what I'm looking at here. Just a little scared. My follow-up is in 3 weeks but I've already emailed the doc's office with details so I'll hear back from them in the morning. It's useless going to my local hospital because all they'll say is to contact my surgeon. He's an hour from here. The best ER for these issues is in his town 3 blocks from his office. When I developed the first seroma I went to my local hospital and they didn't have a clue what to do so said wait for my surgical follow-up 3 days later. 2 days after that the seroma had greatly multiplied in size so my folks drove me the hour to the other hospital where at least we got answers. By that time my bp had plummeted to 90/60. I normally have low bp due to my spinal cord injury. But it dropped from 105/70 ish (which is even low for me) in the 2 days between those ER visits :-( I hate this whole bloody thing :-(",

It's about half the length of our usual walks we do everyday. The first half I can do on asphalt and the side of the road because they are side streets. The second half had to be done on sidewalk. Total time? Not quite 2.5hrs. Not bad, eh? Of course I don't think anyone has seen a power chair move that slowly! Lol I only took one demerol with my pills last night and when I woke up in the middle of the night I decided to do my therapy while I was awake. It is so much better doing it lying down. Took about 30 minutes. I finally did fall asleep again and when I woke up I barely had the pain that I always wake up with. My demerol would have worn off long before. Today, no Tylenol and just discomfort pain until the final 5 blocks. I came home and rested. Just took 2 demerol and am 3/4 crashing which is awesome. I know I might need a down day tmw but that's alright - I actually experienced freedom today and it was wonderful. I loved watching my little guy walking beside me and it made it feel almost like the past 2 months didn't happen. I won't overdo anything and I'll be sure to rest. I'm getting used to feeling these new boobs with the therapy and I'm glad that even though they are only going to be AA/A when everything is healed I'm glad I didn't get the implants (I just mean for me, for those ladies who have chosen implants or didn't have the option I had, you've made the right decision for you). The oddest thing is I've yet to find wearing clothes that fit me before when I was a D comfy. They feel tight even though I look in the mirror and see they are too big. One step at a time to l learn this new physical image. I had the same problem when I lost 80lbs. A year later I'd look in my mirror and still see huge. Now I see small but feel huge. The mind sure likes to play tricks. Sorry for the long-winded post. I've read everyone's posts today and you are all in my prayers as always.",

      "Content": "Sep 22, 2013 10:35PM - edited Sep 22, 2013 11:13PM by poodle_mum Update: I finally did my therapy twice (and one mini version). The one I did sitting up. BAD choice. Not only was it painful and I couldn't put proper pressure on it, I also was extremely nauseous and nearly blacked out. So tonight I did it after I went to bed. I did the entire therapy and the popcorn boob actually did release some drainage, even the two under the areola (when I did it sitting up I didn't even know there was a second one). I also discovered a swollen pocket (just before bed) under the hole across almost the entire part of the ribcage. I'm going to keep an eye on it. I've noticed I've had a lot of pain there the past few days but I thought it was just from doing too much. I think it is the original seroma but it's just a heck of lot bigger. I say this because when I did the upper part of it I felt it starting to be part of the popcorn boob. My right side that physically almost looks normal (if you can find a definition of normal with what it looks like), is extremely swollen. Ironic. It had that accordion look to it that is still there but definitely swollen, to the point that earlier tonight I could feel the swelling going in the direction of my under arm and after putting on my undershirt today I looked in the mirror and saw it was bigger than the other one. As much as I hate to say it, I'm hoping something opens and it starts to drain that way. I'm glad I did it this time while laying down because I was nauseous again and it helped to find spots that were not noticeable sitting up. If only my right side would turn into a popcorn boob, it would probably be more bearable. I'm getting lots of fluids - I can't drink clear water because one of my meds causes it to taste like metal but I've bought those huge cans of flavoured ice tea powder and I only use 1/3 or 1/4 the amount of the powder that it calls for to make up over 2 litres of water and just that little bit of flavouring helps me drink at least 4-6 litres a day. I did visit my Grandma at the hospital on Saturday and decided to show her. She reassured me they will heal and that she was glad they got everything out and it was very nice of the doctor to try to give me something up here. I told her I could have had implants and she said \"he was able to create something from what you already have and I'm glad you didn't get them.\" To all you ladies here, I feel like I know you so well despite only being here a few weeks and we're each individuals who have different diagnoses and treatments. My heart goes out to each of you as you face the next step on your journey. I can't recall everyone's names and as I'm on my phone it's difficult to scroll up and by the time I scroll back down, I'll have forgotten your names. That's one thing that baffles me. At 40, this thing has caused so much short term memory problems but they say it's the pain, meds and lack of sleep. I'd like to get back to work but this is a slow recovery. In any case, I want to express my condolences to the one who lost a family member recently. I also want to wish a belated happy birthday to the birthday girl. As for the head shaving party, I'm glad it went so well, it is such a blessing to have family and friends rally alongside you. To Jennylee, I extend a warm welcome. I found this support group soon after my surgery and all the ladies welcomed me with open arms, during rants, raves and accomplishments. There are days when I don't think I can bear anything more (especially when I ended up in the ER three times in one week in addition to my surgeon's office! ). I keep you all in my prayers and I hope even though everyone is going to other topics that pertain to your individual needs (I have as well), I hope we stay together for longer because I feel we know each other so well and we are the August ladies. All my best to you and you are all in my prayers as you enter this new stage of recovery.",

So, he cut and scraped off all the outside skin to the point where it was bleeding - nice big open hole but to be honest - it looks so nice compared to before. I've had a decubitus ulcer before so open wounds don't really bother me. That one took 4 years to heal and ate through part of my muscle - ended up being 4\"x6\" and 2\" deep.  That's why I'm on the ball with this - I know what something small can become. I told him on Monday, I know some might think I'm paranoid, but there was something definitely wrong.  So anyway, when I saw him I told him he was probably as tired of seeing me as I was of him.  And he told me not at all.  For the first time in 3 months the man actually had a conversation with me.  He actually has a vocabulary of more than a dozen words!!! LOL  In any case, he asked me who had been putting the dressings on this week and I told him my girlfriend and I.  He said, oh, you do it so well, I guess you don't need nursing care.  I told him, nope, but if you guys could supply the dressings and everything I need, I'd really appreciate it.  So even though the nurse was supposed to give me 14 days supply, she gave me 10 which is fine because I still have some of my own here.  I guess knowledge of wounds related to spinal cord injuries come in handy when you have something like this - I refused to accept that nature would take its course.  Apparently the therapy is going well - looks like it's really helping everything heal.  The right side is swollen but because there's been no drainage and I have almost full sensation in that area (only a small section that I don't), the seroma (accordion) will probably re-absorb.  There is one stitch still holding the one area together even after all this time so that's a good thing.  If it pops, well, then I'll cross that bridge if it comes. So change the dressings everyday - continue therapy twice daily and I go back in two weeks. Congrats to those who have made it through your first round of chemo.  Pam - great news for work.  Lisa, keep your chin up, everything will go fine.  Wrenn - thinking of you and looking forward to hearing what the next step is for you and praying it all comes together.",

I feel like I'm 100 years old and can't remember some things. They've got me on drugs for pain, nausea and a few other things related to this thing. I want off them so at least I can remember stuff. There are nights when I can't remember if I've taken my pills so now I have a system. I've always put them in this one little pill bottle I have so I can take them all at once. So after I've taken them, I turn the bottle upside down. So I know if the lid is down, then I've taken them and then before bed I put it back in the kitchen with the lid side up. Hey, if it works! LOL KBee - so glad to hear your kids are doing well. Now's the time for a nanny-cam to see what the mess is like before you walk into the house, eh? Hope they get you on the meds and you can head home. Don't overdo it though. Lisa - hope you get through things without the same effects as last time. Glad to hear you didn't have the same weight loss as last time, I know that is one of your fears. I know what the Lorazepam is like. I'm on that and Diazepam at the same time as well as two sleeping pills but I'm still not sleeping well. I find the Lorazepam has a very short effect for me. It makes me want to sleep almost immediately but then it wears off too fast. It was very nice seeing those ladies today. It gives you hope when you've spent the past 3 months in this cycle and not knowing what the ultrasound is going to show when he finally gets it done. If I need more surgery, so be it. At least I'll know what I'm dealing with whereas this time I was going in blind. Heading to bed soon - hope Dayton decides he's going to bed too. Last night I had the heat on in the bedroom and he decided he wasn't ready for bed so he opened the door to come out and play. OY! He was not impressed when I told him he had to go back to bed. I'll bring some of his toys in with us tonight. That's the only thing about a service dog, he knows how to open everything and makes himself busy when he's bored - then I come and find out how's been entertaining himself. :-D",

The sores are from not being able to wash my hair very often (I can't use the dry shampoo because I'm allergic to one of the ingredients) plus one of my meds apparently has caused some of the problems.",

It might sound weird to some people but I'm sure you all have had that same feeling. He told me he would make sure I had my nipples. I do know they did the skin sparing method and my nipples are sewn back on - sort of like you see in breast reduction pictures. He took everything and used my own fatty tissue to give me what will be AA boobs when the swelling is gone. I only had three weeks to get used to this whole issue but even on the day of surgery when he was doing his various artwork, he asked me three times if I wanted the way he was doing it or have a different surgeon take everything off, perfectly flat, nothing there and some day later go back for a \"re-build\". I said no way - do what you're doing but \"please\" can I have my nipples. From what I've read of the nipple sparing method, it is nothing like mine. Granted I've only been doing this since July and my head is still spinning. How to explain the pain - if you were (without all this mess), lie on your back and take a deep breath stretching your back into the mattress, you would feel a pressure spot between your breasts and if you put your hand there, you'd feel your ribcage. That is the area I always have pain. It used to be \"knock me over\" sharp when I moved, got up, etc. Now I just feel it as a dullish pain but constant. Sorry for not knowing exactly terminology, etc. This truly was a surprise (as it was for all of you).",

My Mum happened to be at a local restaurant yesterday (she's been doing her part of of the footwork for getting donations for our 1K Run for the Cure in 3 weeks - I told her since she wouldn't let me get her the internet when I bought her netbook, she's stuck gathering donations the old-fashioned way!!! LOL). Anyway, she was talking to a few people she knows and said that she was seeking quarters and she needs them by the end of the month. When they asked why, she told them about me.  In the meantime, a waitress probably in her early 30s missed most of the conversation but overheard something about \"breasts\". So, she told Mum that she was scheduled to have a breast enhancement. Mum said she almost dropped her coffee cup. She could not understand why this young woman who was probably about a C would want to voluntarily inflict pain upon herself for such a ridiculous reason.  Then the woman who has two children, I think aged 10 and 8 told Mum that she has been saving from waitressing because the procedure is $9k.  Thank heavens Mum had already put the coffee cup on the table by that time.  She asked the woman did she not feel that her children would better benefit from the $9k than having her boobs done? The response was something along the line of \"they are so small and it really lowers my self-esteem.\"  My Mum told her that if she defines herself by the size of her boobs, she needs to do a bit of soul-searching. She then told her that I just had mine taken off and what I'm going through and that she should be grateful for what God gave her and that they are healthy because there are a lot of women (and men) who would do anything to be able to look at their body and say \"Thank God, I'm healthy and I'm grateful for what I have\". She was SO mad! Way to go Mum!!! That's the spirit of the 73 year old lady who is walking beside me in 3 weeks.  Her own mother has some small leg issues and had surgery just before me and is now in rehab - she is 92 years old. Guess that's where I get some of my spirit from eh?",

I read the 20cc thing somewhere and thought that sounded really odd because my \"popcorn boob\" has maintained approximately 20cc for the past 2 weeks - sometimes shifting either way. So if they take it a drain at 20cc, wouldn't there be a strong possibility of seroma? I'm just curious how that works. I'm one of the few women my doc didn't put drains in. Yes, I'm glad I finally broke down and asked for the Demerol. Even with all the surgical pain I was at least getting some sleep. I guess it's because it's so soon post-op that they've got this therapy started that has pushed me to the ceiling of my high threshold level for pain. But, I suppose by the obvious popcorn boob, the man knows when and why to prescribe this therapy. I have a friend whose sister had to do the same (different surgeon) and started at about 6 weeks post-op. She said it was uncomfortable but not painful but she had drains for I think 10 days and no later seroma development. Her therapy was focused on scar tissue reduction - I'm grateful I didn't have her surgeon, I could have done a better job with a hacksaw :-( in fact it was her nurse who did a follow-up with her that recommended the massage therapy. Yep, I guess we all are in the same boat, we just have different designed oars to row with, eh?",

I only signed up for preventative mastectomy due to family history. I came out with a diagnosis of DCIS (Thank God low grade), lymph node biopsy that I wasn't expecting, seromas, a hole in my rib where for lack of a better term \"my under-boob\" used to be, painful therapy no one told me about (which again thank God is working well on the one side), lack of energy, no interest in food, consistently low bp and hospital visits at least once a week - sometimes two or three. My biggest concern before was \"they're lopping off my boobs.\" Now it's basically \"let's get through this day without any troubles.\" I wish we could go to sleep for six months and wake up perfectly healthy and with nice looking boobs. I started feeling down in the dumps because I was looking at all this mess that used to be two intact girls (while not what I would have liked them to look like - but...) and thought to myself - \"really, no one is going to want these. \" My girlfriend says they look fine and I've often wondered if she's saying that to make me feel better or if in fact it doesn't bother her. I always said that if any future partner had to go through bc, it would never change how I felt about her. But now being on the opposite side, I can't wrap my head around her really wanting this (I know I'm extremely grateful for what I have as many ladies have not had that choice and their journeys in that arena are significantly more involved than mine). Sorry for the depressing post, I guess I'm just frustrated and want my life back. Chins up ladies, I know you guys have helped me so much the past month and you are all in my thoughts and prayers.

I have great news - the hole the surgeon worked on last Wednesday is coming along well. I'm surprised and happy to see it cleaning up so well. I think he'll be very pleased when he sees me in two weeks :-) I got a really nice email yesterday from the organiser of the Survivors tent for the CIBC Run for the Cure that will be next Sunday. I'm getting excited. I know the day is going to wear me out but it will be worth it and it's a step forward back into the world since I've been so worn out this month. Plus they are having a Tea in a few weeks so they invited all the Survivors who are taking part in the walk to come with a guest. I'm going to take my Mum because I'm proud she is walking with me. I tried working on my stamp collection the other day but the repetitive movement was just too hard on me. I hadn't anticipated everything that happened and thought I could take my recovery period to relax and work on them ... oh well ... that's life :-) So step by step, right ladies? Let's hope for a good week for all of us.",

      "Content": "Nov 7, 2013 04:42PM - edited Nov 7, 2013 07:00PM by poodle_mum KBee - sorry to hear about your friend. Jo - I have another friend who had a lumpectomy and she said the same thing. She had to go through the radiation and chemo and said if she had known what she knows now, she would have had a mastectomy. She said if it comes back, she's not going to let them talk her into lumpectomies. I have noticed there are a lot more doctors (at least around here) who offer the option of a bilateral mastectomy over lumpectomies because in the long run, they feel it is easier emotionally for the woman after she heals and if she has chosen reconstruction, etc. Of course there are no guarantees for any of us. I feel like I'm in a stagnant spot - no further ahead but at least we're not backtracking. I'm trying not to think about next year and the possibility of another surgery. I got bold yesterday and cut off my hair (brush cut). I should have done it two months ago. I've had lots of sores - first because I can't wash it on a regular basis but also they think one of my meds is not helping the situation either. So, I figured, I mainly cover my head anyway because of my faith so no one knows the difference and if someone happens to see me with just enough hair to cover my head - who cares. I know, I'm preaching to the choir here. I do wish I had done it before, I wasn't anticipating the sores of course and maybe that would have either prevented them or at least not be as bad as they have been. I'm concerned about my scheduling for the surgeon over December, because the schedule he has me on now, means my appt will fall on Dec 24th and I don't know if he works that day. If he doesn't change my schedule, I could end up with a space of 5 weeks between appts depending on whether he takes holidays over Christmas time. I go on the 19th and I'm going to make sure I have a clear schedule because I've just made it to every 3 weeks and even with that, I'm in pain and almost non-functional for a week. He'd rather I not do every 2 weeks because this way it gives things time to heal a bit and he can see how things are going - he's really tracking the incision areas and even opened a spot in a different place last time that apparently \"he didn't like\". I know, don't worry about the future, take each day as it comes. My diet now includes the 5\" tortillas with my home-made soup and also two kind of Peak Frean cookies that I can eat now - of course the main staple is my chocolate shakes. Oh, and I've found that I can have one of those tiny Greek yogurts once a day (although it does feel heavy and I need to eat it slowly) and I can eat a banana every day. So, I guess there is a light at the end of the tunnel :-) When I can finally eat REAL food, my first trip is to get Poutine. I'm a Canadian and I can't live without my Poutine and it's killing me!!!! LOL I never realised how much of a staple in my diet my Poutine is. I also miss Pizza. I hope all you ladies that are having the troubles with heartburn are able to find at least some solution that will ease things up. My thoughts and prayers are with you all.",

I thought I was going in for preventative mastectomy as I have 5 immediate female family members who passed away from BC and 3 survivors. I am 40 years old. My surgeon is not one for long conversations but his first comment was that all his patients needed a recent mammogram. Then he did a physical exam and as I was there with the intent of a preventative mastectomy, after examining my left breast he said \"no need for a mammogram and we'll schedule your surgery for the first available opening.\" So within 3 weeks I was in the operating room. While his communication skills aren't great :-) he's an awesome surgeon and I was grateful that he chose the method he did as he originally said that I would definitely have lots of scarring. So here I am 2 weeks later. He did not put in drains as he said I didn't need them. I have developed a seroma 10cm in length and 2cm in depth as of last Sunday. By Tuesday my nipple looked like it exploded and there was a lot of bleeding from an opening at the bottom near the rib cage. He wasn't concerned and said it was normal and he'd see me this coming Tuesday. Obviously for him this is normal, he sees it everyday. I'm starting to get used to it and the rib cage area has stopped draining/bleeding. As I said I'm grateful he was able to use this method. He said he got everything in there, it is clear and all clean margins so I'm grateful I went in when I did. I just wasn't prepared for \"preventative\" to turn into \"cancer\". I don't really have anyone to talk to so I'm grateful I found this site. I'm wondering if anyone else has had this procedure and experiences a lot of pain between the breasts at the ribcage area? I don't take narcotics, only extra strength Tylenol. I've had this pain since day go mostly when I try to go from a laying down or sitting position to standing up. It's much better than 2 weeks ago :-D but I just wondered if others have had that too. I sure wasn't prepared for all the bruising and even still getting used to seeing my body looking different. I'm grateful that my nurse had been through two mastectomies, the \"traditional type\" for lack of a better term for this newbie in this world. I could never get through the past month without her. Anyway, I just wanted to share my story with someone else. Thank you for listening.",

I finally said, can you do everything you believe needs to be done and still leave me boobs and nipples (and I criticise his articulation? Lol). While at that point he couldn't give me 100% but he said \"I do believe so\". I trusted him. After surgery all he said was he got everything, clean margins, all clear. I reversed the question and said \"was this the best method?\" He said \"yes, we got everything (apparently they really do go on a fishing expedition in there), I was able to give you a nice little shape even though your nipples are smaller.\" Well, coming out of surgery those sounded like good things to me :-) He told me that since everything is ok and at this time I do not require any chemo or radiation, he'll discuss the details later. He did say he was happy he went in when he did. I'm only speculating but maybe he just found some \"minor issues\"? Perhaps something that had I waited for a mammogram in a few years could have put me in a whole different world. I don't know.

Then repeat it all in the late afternoon and then come home and rest and try to eat supper (I'm still not on very good speaking terms with food but that may change with the pain pills). Then at bedtime, the outside will be about 10 minute max, come home and get one of the fibre bars, take my drugs, do the therapy and I should be out like a light. I want to take full control of taking Jr (my working dog) outdoors. I absolutely hate having others taking him out because I don't like asking for them to do it plus he tests them to see if they're on the ball to reprimand him the right way.

The same applies to things such as those who have drains - rather than having to go to a clinic or their doctor, before they leave the hospital the paperwork is already completed for community nursing. It is also often the community nurse that removes drains (unless otherwise noted by the doctor) - Just like they remove staples from c-sections at your home.

As you know I had DCIS last August, nipple sparing.  A growth came up in November that they thought at first was scar tissue due to the complications of my seromas.  I went on chemo, the growth continued. In March they canned the chemo since it was an obvious growth, scar tissue doesn't grow! :-) I was too sick to have surgery so they had to wait it out.  IDC so continual x-rays, etc to make sure it wasn't spreading into the ribcage. Ultimately I had surgery June 20th. 4.5x5x4cm - she had to go slightly under the ribcage.  Pathology reports came back three weeks later - she got it all.  She seriously wasn't sure she was going to get it - but it's all gone - I'm cancer free!!! I joined Flat and Fabulous on Facebook and I love it. No complications from this surgery. Drains came out in 5 days. Small seromas on each side near drain sites.  The left one has almost totally reabsorbed.  The right one is still on its way to reabsorbing but it will do fine. She's going to see me in March (she \"accidentally got pregnant\" so my 6 month check up had to be postponed).  She will decide at that time if she or I want to go back in for some minor clean up of any extra skin that may not flatten out completely. I go in January for my BRCA assessment. So all in all, I'm doing great.  Slowly getting back into my normal routine. I have to remember to slow down a bit and not do too much since I have to do everything with my arms and I tend to forget until \"after the fact\" that I'm still healing. I'm using pure coconut oil on the incisions and area to loosen it up - the tightness in the morning was awful.  So once the incisions were clear and free and fully healed up, I started using the coconut oil twice a day and it's really helped a lot.  My porcupine is totally untamed, it's coming in thicker than it was before the chemo, sadly the grey still decided to return, but that's alright. I lost my grandma 4 weeks after surgery. We thought we were going to lose her last summer and against the advice of my family, I told her I had breast cancer and would be having surgery, she hung on and went home to her apartment.  In and out of the hospital over the year. She had gangrene in her legs that was spreading throughout her body.  In May they told us she would probably be gone within 3 weeks.  A week or so later I found out I would be having my surgery and showed her the tumour which was quite prominent.  She held on.  She was in the hospital shortly after I had my surgery but came home and celebrated her 93rd birthday July 3rd.  She was back in the hospital the following week and then I had my follow-up on the Tuesday two weeks later.  She asked Mum how I was doing and if I was well enough to \"officiate\" her funeral.  Mum said yes and my grandma went home the following day and passed away almost exactly 24 hours after she heard that I was fine.  She was more of a parent to me than a grandmother and she fought to stay here this past year until she knew I was ok.  It did set me back a bit - developed the right seroma (very small) on the right side because I had to use my crutches for the time of funeral, etc. But here I am! I haven't tried using my manual chair yet because of the movement and I want to ease into it and not do anything stupid.  I also signed up for the CIBC walk again this year and I've raised over $2,030 (I raised $1,030 last year) and I'm still raising more for the next month.  So, as crappy and hard a year as it has been - I'm pleased to say - I'm healthy, I'm happy and I'm alive and here to stay! :-D",

Wrenn - how have things been going for you since you came home? Are they getting everything under control? I have one hole on my left that is big but getting better and a tiny one on the right - hope they've given you the good gauze bandages for everything and not Kendall or Curad.

If I could eat the food I wouldn't need the drugs!  Lol On the upside - I'm more involved in life now.  I've been averaging 4 hrs in action outside the house.  Today I took the bus to my local stamp show and spent about 6 hrs today on my own (well with Dayton of course) and too much money but had a great time   I discovered there is a bus that does the route of the city to the main shopping malls as well as the place where I was going today.  All the past 5 years and didn't even know it existed.  It's a milk run type of bus but I can avoid the crowds on the bus.  So I'm going to start doing more outings like that to get myself out more.  ",

How you manage to have the energy for a walk/run this soon after surgery baffles me. I realise I didn't factor in my disability but I had hoped by now to be a lot further along with strength, etc. A very difficult thing for someone who is an outdoors girl. Except for my stamp collection I'd rather be outside. Sad thing is even after 3 weeks I still can't barely work on my stamps because I tire so quickly. Apparently it's hypotension. People with spinal cord injuries often naturally have normal low bp. So I'm usually somewhere around 110/78 area. In the past three weeks it has dipped as low as 90 /60. Not good.

Ironically, I was in my power chair but I was toast at that point - I was in pain shortly after arriving but I made it through being out for a total of 4 hours. Might not sound like much but since this was my first outing, it sure was a lot. My Mum managed to do 1.5k (not bad for being 73 and not a walker!). She was so proud - my heavens, I don't think there's anyone she saw that she didn't tell my life story to! LOL We got our big stickers to write who we were walking for. So she had hers on the back of her coat with my name and \"my daughter\" underneath. Mine said \"Me!\" and I put it on the side bag of my chair. On my return trip one of the runners, patted my shoulder. That felt so nice. My service dog walked beside me and on his harness we put one of the stickers and wrote \"Mummy\" on it. That got a lot of smiles and I was proud to have my poodle at my side. It was so nice to see people cheering everyone through the walk. There were a number of survivors there and a special booth where we could have coffee and cookies, get fingernails painted - but I was in too much pain to enjoy that :-( Some people couldn't believe I was out there so soon after surgery. It was spitting rain the whole walk - nothing big so I put a raincoat over my legs and tried to keep bundled with my sweatshirt and coat. I also got some more donations after my post yesterday - grand total??? $1,005 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Every ounce of pain was worth it to raise that much money :-) I did it especially for the August Girls Club :-D",

I had a fast growing mass that at the time of surgery was over 5cm and had a break-away section.  She was able to get everything out.  She said it was a lot of work but there is absolutely nothing there now.  Thankfully no nodes were affected, but she wants yearly scans of my nodes. I also need to be tested for BRCA.  I have drains and she will remove them on Wednesday.  Her method is to go topless (open to air) and never leaves drains in longer than 5 days. If I have any waves or anything I'm not comfortable with 6 months from now, she will go in and clean that up.  I'm not a candidate for reconstruction and I don't want it either. I am home with nursing care and extremely lucky. Who knew I'd go in for preventative surgery and end up with low grade DCIS and 10 months less 2 days I would be in surgery for invasive cancer?  Oh well, it is what it is.  I hope all of you ladies are doing well and I thank you for everything over the past 10 months.

I have a friend who mentioned to me yesterday that her friend's mother had breast cancer 7 years ago and lymph nodes removed and in the past few weeks has noticed her one arm has turned red and is getting very swollen but she can't figure out why. I told her that it sounds like Lymphedema and tell her friend that her mother needs to go see her doctor asap. She couldn't understand why 7 years later suddenly something would occur and I told her that I've read it can happen at any time, not necessarily at the time of surgery or even after being cancer-free. I had a scare the other day. I went to change my dressings and the holes were completely closed up and the area was grey. That happened literally overnight. I go in for my regular appt this coming Tuesday and though \"uh oh\". So since everything was closed I didn't put a dressing on the area. Yesterday morning I decided to take a look and lo and behold they both had opened up to about the size they were on the outside two weeks ago and bleeding. What a relief. The greyness was gone. I'll mention it to them on Tuesday and see if they can tell me what the heck happened. Strange experience. I decided to wait until tonight to change the dressings - I'm a bit nervous to see what happens over the next few days.",

KBee - Congrats on your finale :-) Wrenn - I'll be there at your side tomorrow in thought, you'll be okay. Babs - Glad to hear you get to sit this holiday out - we had our Thanksgiving last month and it felt strange not doing anything to help - at least you'll get to contribute by cleaning the kitchen, eh? LOL That will be wonderful for you to visit with your daughter on Sunday. Lisa - keep your chin up girl, you're doing great! Everyone is in my thoughts and prayers.",

I guess my journey starts all over again in the new year. Isn't it ironic that this all started out because I decided to do preventative due to family history?  I guess it's Divine Providence that I decided that when I did,  who knows where I would have been two years down the line.  I know it's the holiday season for most of you  and you don't need a downer,  I just needed to \"talk\" to someone.  The family is having a hard time dealing with it. ",

Ladies, I'm having a really hard time with this one right now.  My biggest \"goal\" last year was keeping my nipples.  Now, I'm going flat with  no nipples, no reconstruction.  I also have to have genetic testing done later because she's concerned about ovarian cancer due to breast cancer going through both sides of my family. I'm trying to wrap my head around the no nipples issue.  Please, for those of you who have lost yours - I need help to deal with this.",
