In response to telling people though.....I have told anyone who wants to know.  I'm very candid and that too has been theraputic.  If you can imagine, I went into classrooms full of students a day after diagnosis and told all of them! Mind you, I teach high school.  They needed to know why I would be out, and they needed to know that there was a face attached to all the \"fun\" they have on \"Go Pink Day\" every October.  I reminded them to tell their Moms, Aunts, Gramas to have their mammograms (that was how mine was detected).  I have an outpouring of support from parents, faculty, staff. Kids hugged me, daily ask how I'm doing, handmade beautiful silk scarves forme, asked to run Susan G. Komen in my honor.   Our cafeteria workers took up a special fund to dontate to my bike Ride For Roswell (my cancer institute's yearly fundraiser---ironic how it's helping me now!!).   I've told the adult women in my life and answered their questions honestly.  I've even started a weekly email for a select group of friends that has turned out to very theraputic for me.  My feeling is the more you hold inside the more you have to deal with alone. ",
