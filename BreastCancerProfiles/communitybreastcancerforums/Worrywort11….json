I am also 37 and I just got my first mammogram because I have been having a pain in my breast for the last 7 months. They found a two areas of concern and now I have to meet with a specialist next Friday. I too have been having really bad dreams and I had a person I knew die of cancer on Sunday and a friend of a friend also died of cancer on Sunday. Right now the good news is we still have not heard anything bad yet, so we have to keep our spirits up and hope for the best. I too have a bad feeling in my gut but I don't know if its my head playing tricks on me! Keep positive.",
