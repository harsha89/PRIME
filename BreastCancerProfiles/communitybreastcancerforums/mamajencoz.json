      "Content": "Apr 19, 2015 12:54PM - edited Apr 19, 2015 12:54PM by mamajencoz Good Morning Ladies from Maryland! Today is nesting day. I have to overwhelming feeling of I need to clean and organize for this up coming week. Tomorrow I get my second AC infusion. I'm more nervous then I was getting the first. I don't know if the side effects will be better controlled or if they get worse as you go. Any pointers? I had nausea and headache.. not able to eat for 3 days then body aches from the day after shot. I'm trying to keep up with everyone here.. I must admit I'm more of a reader then a \"poster\" My hair is slowly coming out I have 1 thin spot. I've been back and forth about just getting it over with and shaving it but I guess in the back of my mind I thought it would already be gone by now if it was \"really\" all falling out. I know... its coming.. just a fleeting thought. My skin is horrible! I have almost pimples on my face. they are tiny .. not like a random pimple that shows up before prom. They itch a bit and hurt... then usually gone in a day or so followed by another few showing up. Is this from the AC or am I just eating too much ice cream? I hope all is well with you ladies! Oh and could someone add my first name to the list... Its Jen Thank you",

My head was full and swimmy most of the day but was better after a power nap or two. I slept on and off last night waking up to take meds and sip water. My hair decided to fall out in pretty nice clumps starting yesterday morning. I may just shave it today. Who knows. 1 minute I'm ready.. the next not so much. It wont be a decision in a few days now ya know. Hair clumps out Started at day 13 from 1st  ac treatment) Anyway I'm praying for the best today and the next few days. So far we are starting out better then the first dose. I have physical therapy at noon today followed by my Nuelasta shot. I'm going to religiously take the Clairton this time in hopes it helps.I I wish you all the best today!!! ((((huggies))))",

My nausea was controlled better this time. They gave me 5 during infusion and 2 to take at home. I started round the clock Monday night and haven't stopped yet. I'm afraid Ill feel sick if I stop taking it. Bone pain from the shot is bearable today. day 2 and 3 were bad. I took my Rx pain prescription from my surgery to help it. Yesterday I'd hoped I'd be better but my energy level was rock bottom and I had no appetite at all. Today I'm eating small amounts and resting instead of sleeping. I'm ready to feel better now. Aint no one got time for all this! LOL best wishes to you all Jen",

I pray the rest falls out sooner than later. Ive noticed a pattern already with my SE and ive only had 2 AC. The biggest change is while Im \"down and out\" I crave salty foods. When I come out of the SE hell... all I want is sweet foods. And I almost NEVER eat sweets! I buy 5 lbs of sugar a year ladies! But all I want today is ice cream and French toast. Maybe i'll eat coffee ice cream and that will make it ok for breakfast. LOL I hope you all have a great weekend! Jen",

I had ac#3 on Monday and it's been a rough week for me. I felt like I had a bad hangover that night and slept a lot. Tuesday morning wasn't too bad but sunk into the headache yuck by evening. Got my shot then came home to bed. I had broken sleep for the next 3 days. Sleeping about 2 hours then up for 2. Body pain for the first 24 hours was horrible! And I even took Claritin! Then it was icky stomach, heartburn, unable to eat much or sleep despite my feeling of exhaustion. It's now Sunday morning and I'm just now feeling ok. At this point I have no idea how I can go through this again even if it is ONLY 1 more time before moving onto weekly Taxol. I'm petrified about getting Taxol, and the though of more side effects. It's hard to remember that cancer is the enemy and not the Chemotherapy at this point. I know I really shouldn't complain compared to some of your SE but this sucks! Today is Mother's Day and I should be in a great mood (5 kids and a granddaughter I'm blessed with) but I'm all weepy today. (Sigh)",

I think the last chemo billed to my insurance was $7800. Add the cost of the drugs itself, anti nauseas, blood work, nulasta shots, pharmacy costs, time in the chair charge etc... Yes praise God for insurance! I hit my $5000 out of pocket max before I even had surgery! It kind of makes you rethink the \"cost of LIVING\"",

I just seem to rattle it off at times followed by I'm GOING TO BE OK.. stop tearing up. I know that sounds bad but after you tell so many people it just is like regular conversation. I had to put myself in check because I told myself.. the ones I'm telling have only the past 30 seconds to deal with it and I've been living with this for a month or so now. And warning you will see a pattern... they #1 want to comfort you (oh my goodness what can I do to help you) #2 try to relate (well they know of at least 1 person in their life time that had either the same cancer or some form of disease that they were healed from. I have to apologize at this point for sounding negative... MOST of the ones told are genuinely compassionate and just want to help you feel better and confident. Then there are others who push their \"I just heard of ______ that someone in France used and it cured their cancer so if you want to try that instead of putting that \"Chemo\" into your system\" As I said, MOST people just want to be a good friend. Also to help everyone follow what was going on so I didn't have to go over the story again and again.. it helped for family that lived far away too.. I began a \"blog/site\" on CaringBridge. That way you post once of what's going on and they can either get an email of the update or check it out when they want to. I have mine secured and by invite only. That way I have control who goes on there and personally see my journey. They have to give me their email address and I send the invite before they can see it.  It's free.. there is an app for smart phones.. and they can comment on journal entries so they feel involved too. It's simple and easy to do. It made my phone stop ringing 100 times a day. You can also create a thing on Facebook too.. just make it private if you want to. I hope this helped.",
