It's the same with radiation. We keep on cooking even after the tx is done. My doctor and radiation tech both said about 1-2 weeks beyond the day you finish the rads before you are sure you're done burning.   As for my decision not to do hormonal therapy my MO showed me statistics for my risk of recurrence if I did nothing more than a lumpectomy, if I added on radiation, and if I did hormonal therapy. I had to choose the number I was comfortable living with. Since there is such a large decrease in risk by doing radiation therapy I agreed to do it (though I actually also looked into the Van Nuys Prognostic Index, used for DCIS, to see if I was comfortable skipping it and I wasn't). Though I have non-invasive cancer, clear margins and a small tumor I had high grade cancer and at that point I quit fighting radiation.    The statistics I've seen when tamoxifen is used in conjunction with radiation therapy cut your risks only a couple of percentage points more over 5 years. Besides the menopausal symptoms brought on by tamoxifen there are also the risks of blood clots, strokes, uterine cancer and cataracts. I've already been through menopause and would probably have to use AI which have less SE than tamoxifen but they have their own. They include possible heart attacks, broken bones and osteoporosis. I really didn't want the risks or the walk back through menopause hell and since I'm older I'm taking the chance to pass on the pills. I probably wouldn't make the same decision if I were a lot younger and had many more years ahead of me but I'm not so I'm going to take my chances.",

I will be getting about 10% more radiation than I'm getting on whole breast and it will aim at just my scar and tumor bed. I have to have 8 boosts. Up until now I've been having 3D conformal radiation (a kind of photon radiation). For my boosts my doctor wanted to use electron radiation as it can stay shallower. But to do this they had to flatten my breast down so that there was very little space between my surgical scar and the actual tumor bed. To do this they made a plastic mold to push down my breast (not an easy thing as I'm big breasted). They took a plastic mesh material and got it wet and warm. They then stretched it tightly over my breasts and bolted it to the table. They let it cool and harden and it will be the mold they use on me each day for my boosts. They will attach it to the radiation table and it will allow them to get me in the same position each day and also smash me down. Because of the mold I'll be able to get rid of my Sharpie marks. Yay! I also got no new marks today. They then put me in the CT scanner to see if I was going to be able to be smashed flat enough. The CT tech says the doctor doesn't think so and I'll probably have to do my boosts with the same type of radiation I'm using now but they will still use the mold on me. The appointment took about a half hour and while the mold making wasn't the most fun it wasn't unbearable either. I'll find out my plan later this week.",

One of the things I learned this week is that I didn't ask the right questions. Of course it's hard to ask the right questions if you don't know what to ask. So I learned to ask where the entire treatment area is. I have faithfully applied cream to my breast after each treatment and all throughout the day but no one told me how high up on my chest this was going to go and now I have a rash all over my upper chest. I'm trying to really cover the area heavily in cream now but there really is no catching up what was lost. My breast on the other hand is holding up well so far though it has become somewhat swollen, heavy and stiff (I'm big breasted). It aches most of the time with some twinges of stabbing pain.  My experiences with fatigue have been kind of strange. I get my treatment at 8 in the morning and faithfully hit a wall at 2 each afternoon. I'm wondering if I had afternoon rads if I would be asleep when the fatigue hits and I wouldn't notice it as much. Anyway, I started getting some fatigue the first week. I don't care if that's too early. It was a fact. But then the second week it wasn't quite as bad. I have good days and I have bad days. But so far, it hasn't just gotten progressively worse each day. It varies. And mine is a strange kind of fatigue. It hits suddenly and I feel shaky and empty, like I just can't move another inch. But I have found if I have tea with caffeine in the afternoon around the time I usually fall apart it isn't as bad. My RO tells me that the SE should start around the 3rd or 4th week (so I guess I just had to do it early) and that the worst of all will be the week after the rads are done. I may either take that entire week off work or work from home. I have an hour commute both to and from work and I get my treatments in the same city as I work. Because of this I think I might start taking Wed. afternoon off so I can get some extra rest. There just aren't enough hours in the day for me to get everything done and still sleep! One of the hardest things for me is the moments of depression. I'm so tired of doing all this. I've been in \"cancer\" mode since September and it feels like it will never end. And at times the dark seems so dark. And then for no particular reason it will lift and I'll feel just great. Who knows why. Anyway, thanks ladies for being here so there is a place we can share and whine and have people around who get how we feel.",

The boosts will be a higher dosage and they are pretty sure I'm going to burn. Not looking forward to those. I'm very fair skinned and sunburn very easily. I'm also large breasted and they said that combination was going to mean trouble for me. So far (and I still have a ways to go) I'm only dark pink on my upper chest and under my arm. I'm light pink on my breast. However I have quite a rash on my chest and it's been there for a while. I'm using aloe on the rash and miaderm on my breast. Some days I just spread both everywhere. Who knows which one is really working best? I'm just pleased that I don't have blisters... yet. I agree with Banba that the fatigue feels like you're on drugs. I get really light headed and my brain feels like it's in a fog. It comes on suddenly for me and usually in the afternoons (I get morning treatments). I try to either just power through it or I go out to my car and take a short nap. The real blessing for me has been that I take every Wed. afternoon off now. I sleep about two hours on those afternoons and it really helps. It also helps me psychologically to break up the monotony of the week with the treatments. I think it's what is going to help me get through. My breast also continues to swell. It is quite a bit bigger than the other one now making the bra begin to be too tight on that side. If I go without a bra any bouncing around causes me pain. My breast is so sore I even have to be careful putting on the cream.  Thanks ladies for being here. No one else really gets what I'm going through and talking to my family just distresses them that there is nothing they can do to \"solve\" it. Venting the other day just made my mom cry so no more talking about it to her.",

I'm red under my arm and on that side of my chest. Under my breast is starting to turn red too. My breast is pretty pink and more evident now that I've removed the stickers that were keeping my marks in place. I have round white spots where the stickers were, showing me just how much my skin has changed. That said though there is no blistering or peeling yet. The rad tech says she doesn't think I'm going to even though the next week or so after treatment is supposed to be the worst. I'll cross my fingers, hope and continue to slather on the cream. The other thing that I've been doing that might have made a difference is that I've been eating turmeric every chance I get. Some studies show that it may help the radiation burns. I made up a mixture of turmeric, black pepper and red pepper and I put it on my eggs in the morning, on my tuna for lunch, on my salad for dinner, everywhere I can figure out to put it. I've also been eating a lot of Indian and Thai yellow curries. I really believe that it has helped cut down the burning that everyone expected me to get. I'm not taking any as a supplement, just using it in the course of my daily diet. You might try it if you're feeling at the end of your rope. It can't hurt. I see my RO again in two weeks for a checkup to see how I'm doing. I'll let you all know how my skin does in the next few weeks. Hang in there ladies! It's almost your turn for this to end!!",

I hope you get past this time and heal soon. I'm now almost 2 weeks out since my last full breast tx and 1 week past my last boost. The skin under my arm is back to pink again from the red it was last week. I'm better able to tolerate skin on skin than I've been in quite a while. The rash I had on my chest is going away and just leaving some dry skin. The rest of my chest is turning kind of tan. All those would have been from my whole breast tx. My breast itself is just starting to heal from the boosts. It's turned back to pink from the pretty dark red it's been this last week. I only had three boosts but they really had an impact on me. The nipple itself is quite sore and doesn't like to be bumped or jostled. I have a bit of pain inside and have to take ibuprofen when it acts up. I'm still putting on miaderm and aloe 2-3 times a day. I've had no peeling and I didn't ever blister. I count myself lucky to have escaped the worst of the wrath of the rad machine. But I also went into this without having to have chemo and I know that made a difference too. I haven't been as tired as I was during tx. But I still go to bed fairly early and took a nap this weekend, though usually I would have napped all my days off. I seem better able to make it through a whole workday without having to fortify myself with caffeine to make it through. It does get better ladies, it just seems to take some time to get our feet back under us. And for some who have weathered more damage to their bodies I'm sure it takes a little bit longer. I'm holding you all in my thoughts and prayers that you are back to a new kind of normal soon.",

Talked to the RO today about the treatment plan and, as expected, they can't do the electron radiation on me. He explained that my tumor bed is too deep in my breast since the electron radiation shoots shallow. So it will be the 3D conformal photon radiation I've been getting all along but just to the surgery scar and tumor bed area and in a stronger dosage. The great news is that since it won't be electron they have cut me back from 8 boosts to 3 and I'm done on Monday!!! OMG! I can't believe they cut a whole week off my tx. I will end up with 28 total treatments. I'm still doing great on the skin. Dark pink under my arm and upper chest area close to the arm. I have a little pink under and on my breast and still have the rash on my upper chest. The doctor really didn't think I would do this well since I'm fair skinned and big breasted. Of course, he had also told me from the start that the worse week will be the week after it ends and I'm not there yet. He wrote me a prescription for Silvadene cream just in case I start to blister after I'm through. We said our goodbyes to each other today as I won't see him again. My MO also said he doesn't need to see me again as well as my BS. Guess I'm back to my nurse practioner at the GYN office. I have refused hormonal therapy and both my RO and MO support my decision. RO said I need a mammogram in 6 months and then yearly after that and my nurse practioner is going to do breast exams for me every 6 months. The fatigue has been okay. I take every Wednesday afternoon off and take a 2 hour nap and I take naps on weekends so that, along with a good dose of caffeine daily, has gotten me through my workdays. Thanks all you ladies for getting me through this in one mental piece. There were days I wasn't so sure I would make it. I'll continue to check in and let you know how the week after works out for me for any that are curious how it might be.",

I had my lumpectomy on 12/9 and my first rad consultation on 12/15. Because of the holidays my simulation was scheduled for Jan. 3. At that time I got my CT scan and three of my markings (ones on each side of my body and one between my breasts). I requested that they not be permanent because, for me, the tattoos were the tipping point of this whole thing. I didn't want to be reminded forever of this part of my life. I found the simulation to be pretty easy. They don't use forms or anything like that where I go. Just have you link your hands above your head and they line up on the marks. I had my first treatment two days later at which time they gave me two more marks, these actually on my breast. They have covered them all with clear tape and I'm not finding them too difficult to keep. I've only had to have the one between my breasts remarked and taped. The others are all holding fine. My treatment time is a bit longer than some of the others who have posted. The machine stops and \"shoots\" at me so to speak 5 different times so it takes longer to complete. Still not more than about 5 -7 minutes but I didn't know it was going to be so much radiation going into it. I've been lucky in that my RO encourages the use of creams and I was given a list of different ones people there have found useful. I am currently rotating about 4 of them and doing fine so far. I'm most concerned about the burning (because I'm very fair skinned and big breasted) and the fatigue (because I'm trying to work through the treatment and not have to take time off). Once a week they x-ray me to make sure all is still on target. It was explained to me that changes in weight can cause them to have to make adjustments. I'll also have to have periodic CBC tests to make sure that the radiation isn't causing problems with either my white or red blood count. It seems that different centers all do things differently. I'm looking forward to hearing how others are holding up and I'm glad to hear that there are others out there with the same fears that I've had in this journey.",
