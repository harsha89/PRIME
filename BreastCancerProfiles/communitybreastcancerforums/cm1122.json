I finished radiation in May 08, and since then have been diagnosed with 2 (I say 1 continuous, never really recovered) skin infection, left breast goes from mildly pink to reddish purple; feels tender and hot. I'm still on antibiotics, but the color is still the same. Is it normal for discoloration to last this long? I worry about Inflammatory BC (\"often mis-diagnosed as skin infection\") but maybe it's just lingering side effects from the radiation.....I had my first mammo last week, and it hurt a little but not unbearable, and the \"looks great!! See you next year\" was worth the pain!",

Sorry to be a downer!!  My comment on the mammo was supposed to be the good news!! I know how unlikely it is, and both docs say don't worry (yet), but as you say we're all jumpy for awhile!!",
