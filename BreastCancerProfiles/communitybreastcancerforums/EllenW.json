I just found out that I have lung mets two months ago, and my Onc is planning to put me on Abraxane/Avastin starting on 8 Jan. I still do not have a detail treatment plan yet.  What is your treatment schedule for these two drugs? I'm really hoping for the same great result as the co-payments for these two drugs are really high.",
