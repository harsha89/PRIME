I had an ultrasound of my left breast and auxilla before they were swollen and the test came as a small less than 1 cm swollen lymph node. I am 35 and do not have any children. I am really worried and loosing my sleep over this. I had a brain tumor surgery 4 months ago and this is impacting my health a lot. The left breast is actually very visibly larger than the right and has become more lopsided . I have read that inflammatory breast cancer is not detected via imaging and breast enlargement is a symptom. Please suggest me what to do.",

I tried googling and all it comes back with is Inflammatory breast cancer. Meanwhile I went to a gynae and she did a thorough clinical breast exam and said that there is nothing to worry but I am still scared to death. Should I wait or do a biopsy or is it that I am just panicking. Please help. Log in to post a reply",
