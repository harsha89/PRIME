I am about 1 1/2 months out from last chemo and my hair is about an inch off the top of my head, the back and sides are very thin but seem to be growing in, my armpit, pubs, eyebrows are all growing back and my lashes are slowly coming back in. My heart just breaks for all of my \"breast friends\" whose hair is permanetly gone, I couldn't even imagine.  It is one thing to be bald when you have cancer and are going thru treatment but to never have it come back and be cancer free just breaks my heart. God Bless!!",

I am thankful for this board and website, I have been reading non stop for a few days now and although the reason that brought all of us to this board SUCKS, I feel like there is a reason we have all met and a reason we are on this journey together.  I enjoy reading how everyone is dealing with this, their feelins and emotions, fears.  God Bless everyone of you.

I am having a really rough time, I stood in the shower last night before bed and I just sobbed.  I am so scared of all the unknown things about to change in my life.  I am embarassed about loosing my hair, I am sad that my 6 and 8 year old little girls will have to watch mommy go thru this.  I am scared that my boyfriend of 5 years will leave me, having BC just brings out so many fears and feelings and I don't know how to handle everything. I feel like I am still in shock over this whole BC thing, I just feel like if I try not to think about it, it will go away.  I keep waiting to wake from this horrible nightmare, but it isn't happening.  Reality is I am 33 years old, and I have BC.  I am going to loose my hair, I am going to loose my breast and who knows what else.  It just sucks. I am so sorry to be such a downer, you all sound so condident and positive and I hope to get to that point but I am just not there yet. I read each and everyone of your post and I am thankful to be able to come here and be a part of such a fantastic group of woman,  I am praying for each and every one of you and you embark on this journey.  We will all forever be bonded by this.  God Bless, Tina",

Just had a BM with immediate breast reconstruction (tissue expanders) 12-27-10.  I only had cancer in the left breast but decided with my age, no family history and having such an aggresive cancer that I would do both breast.  I never want to go thru this again, just take them both be done and over with this.  I didn't want to worry with every lump and bump, with constant testing and waiting for results. The BM isn't as bad as I had imagined, it is painful but tolerable.  I have 4 drainage tubes in and hoping to have them removed tomorrow at my first post op appt with PS.  I have been sleeping in my recliner and taking pain meds around the clock.  Cannot really do anything else at this point.  PS said I will be getting my first post op fill next week and will do them every week until I am at the size I want to be.  I was at a 36 DDD before all of this and am thinking a full C will be just fine, heck I may even just keep them at a full B.  This sure has been a journey.  My thoughts and prayers are with each and everyone of you.  God Bless you thru your journey.
