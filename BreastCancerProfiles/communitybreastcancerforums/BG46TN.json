As far as your Neulasta pains, definitely take the Claritin starting the day of Chemo and for up to 10 days after...If you have the on body injector have them put it on your belly as opposed to your arm. My first chemo I had it put on my arm and the bone pain was excrutiating, now I get it on my belly and its MUCH more bearable, I get 1 day of achy/ sensitive skin feeling...no more horrible pain. My MO also said I could take Advil when the bone pain is bad and heat is awesome! I gargle with salt water a few times a day to keep mouth sores away. Definitely take your nausea meds like clockwork, before you feel sick! As for the constipation I am still struggling with that, I tried colace and it didn't really do much so I have been eating raisin bran for breakfast every day, seems to help a bit better...and lots of water. I find drinking Smartwater or Core Water goes down much easier then regular water, especially during chemo and the few days after..it also has electrolytes which help with some side effects. Good luck ladies!! We are almost done with this blip in our roads <3",

I am working through all of this (I am a teacher) and doing things with my kids to keep things as \"normal\" as possible...my advice is to keep doing what you always do (with in reason and with rest) the more you get up and move around the better you feel (even on those days you want to lay in bed all day) drink TONS of water!!! You've got this! we are strong amazing women!!! Becky ",

DO NOT GOOGLE anything about it....the information on triple neg is outdated... In my case I did chemo first so they could watch and make sure the tumor was shrinking (since chemo is the best treatment for TN) and it worked!! no one can even feel my tumor anymore and it was almost 4cm!! Next I will be having a double mastectomy (I also have a gene mutation), then radiation... There are some great studies going on now for triple neg treatments....look up Copper Depletion and the use of Metformin for breast cancer. My oncologist is looking into these now in case I need them. (Hoping for clear margins and NED after surgery) feel free to message me if you have any questions or if she wants to chat with someone going through the same thing! This site is amazing for information! hugs to you and her!",

Are you doing anything to protect or save them? I have been reading a lot about this since I start Taxotere on the 20th..I'm not sure I am going to do the ice packs on my hands/feet since I hate being cold LOL and it seems like no one else in my center does anything like this (we are in a big room) I dunno Anyway I met a women through this bc forum and she was messaging me about things she did when she was on taxotere so I thought I would share with all of you (will also work with taxol)  This is what she said: I would advise several things for the Taxotere - paint your nails a dark opaque color the night before chemo. I used navy or a dark gray - didn't want to use black. I also iced fingernails and toes for the entire duration of the T infusion, to prevent lifting of fingernails. If your center does not have ice mitts/booties, use bags of frozen peas, that is what I did. I brought them in a small cooler, and also brought a big insulated tumbler (like Tervis) full of ice chips. I held the ice chips in my mouth during infusion to help with mouth sores. The day after chemo I removed the dark polish and applied a coat of clear nail hardener - like OPI or Sally Hansen. I did this daily for 7 days, then removed it and re-applied. I did this two more times over the remaining two weeks until the next infusion. Nail issues are common with Taxotere and they can be permanent. I did lose a pinky toenail but I think my bag of peas did not reach all the way over! The nail grew back really quickly. It seems like a pain to do all that but I had no discolored anils, no ridges, and no peeling or other issues - it was worth it to me. I also kept my nails very short during chemo. I then asked her what the dark color actually did, and she replied: Painting with opaque polish keeps light from penetrating the nail bed - a possible factor in nail loss connected to taxane chemo agents.. The repeated coating with hardener keeps them from getting too thin and bendable/breaking/tearing/peeling over the course of months of chemo. Taxotere is a Sanofi-Aventis drug, and I received a little care pack from the manufacturer on the first day of chemo, and one of the items inside was a bottle of OPI nail hardener!  Pretty interesting and I\"m going to try it, it can't hurt right? I have also read that SLATHERING your hands constantly with heavy duty creams, keeping your nails very short and smoothed edges helps a lot....I have already bought Udder Cream to use. I also read to wear soft comfortable socks and shoes, limit any friction on your toes/nails (My MO said no running etc) I guess I\"m going to have to wear sneakers to work....I'll have to talk to my principal about that LOL What have the rest of you heard?? experienced? plan on doing??",

I am meeting with a radiologist today for a consult...I am far from starting radiation (still need to finish chemo and then have double mastectomy) but I have questions about whether I actually need it....everything I have read said that if you are triple negative, no lymph involvement having a double mastectomy and have (had) a tumor under 5cm does not require radiation.....my oncologist wants me to have it, and of course I will if I really need it and it will improve statistics by a lot (to prevent reoccurance) but I want to hear some of that from the radiologist...both of my surgeons were surprised that I would need it. I also am an hour from the closest radiation center, so that would be 2 hours a day (after work) plus the time I'm in getting radiation EVERY DAY for however long they say I need it..*sigh* I'm tired thinking about it....and I would have to wait 6 months after it ends to get reconstruction switch to my implants...that would be NEXT YEAR! I'm scared of having expanders for all that time!! ugh! Well have a great week everyone!  PS Who is watching April the giraffe waiting for her to give birth? LOL I\"m obsessed! Becky",

I have to say for taxotere #2 I have been feeling pretty good...(#1 was not so fun) I haven't really had any side effects (yet) the only wierd thing is hiccups! starting the day after, on and off all day and still going on 3 days later...but I'll take that over any kind of pain any day! Even my Neulasta didn't give me the pains I usually get the day after it goes off...today my skin feels a little tender but nothing too bad. I was hoping to avoid Rads since my breast surgeon and plastic surgeon both thought I shouldn't need it since I\"m having a double mastectomy and have no lymph node involvement..but my MO still thinks I need it (ugh) So i am going to consult with the RO and see what he says, and hope for just a short amount. I'm upset by the fact that I can't have the exchange from expanders to implants until 6 months after radiation is done...I feel like everything is just getting dragged out longer and longer....I was so hoping to be \"Done\" by the end of summer and be able to move on...now I'll have to add in another surgery, miss more work during the next school year :-( oh well....It is what it is..and I\"m trying really hard to just deal with all this as it comes my way...

I\"m sooo excited!! I met with my MO Friday and he's happy with my progress, I feel pretty good (except the first week after chemos) I will have a bilateral mastectomy in April....I should get date this Friday when I meet with my breast surgeon again. My MO said he is really hopeful of a complete response for me....so I\"m praying for that! but if the pathology comes back with any residual cancer he will put me on Xeloda for a few months (due to the triple neg)..he said there have been studies with great results on women with residual cancer and taking xeloda...he said it can raise your survival rate by 6%....I'll take it! (but really hope I don't need it lol) It is an oral chemo...but he said side effects are minimal on it (mostly hand/foot skin issues) I asked him about Copper Depletion since there have been some studies on that and TN cancer...but he didn't know much about it but was very interested, he told me to bring him the study I found next time.. I also forgot to ask him about Metformin, its a diabetes drug that has had good results also with TN breast cancers... all in all a great appointment...I\"ve been feeling great lately, other then being tired, no other side effects right now so I get a break for 7 more days LOL I usually have my chemo's on Fridays but I changed my last one to Monday since I have my nieces wedding on Sat :-) First grandchild in our family to get married so I wanted to be feeling great for it!  Here are some articles on Copper Depletion and Metformin in case anyone wants to read about it. https://meyercancer.weill.cornell.edu/news/2016-04... http://news.weill.cornell.edu/news/2013/02/copper-...

Talk to your dr about it, my oncologists office had me do nurse education appointment where she went over exactly what chemo was like, possible side effects etc...it definitely made me feel calmer... I'm glad you called your dr, I think you need to just set up the appointment to get things started....it is a rough road ahead of us but just think you are saving your life! this will all be behind us soon! <3 I didn't take anything to relax before my first infusion, but some women do, ask your dr to prescribe something. It was really uneventful once I started day 1... I did clean up a bunch at home before my 1st treatment because I didn't know how I would feel, my husband also helped out a lot with getting things clean (bathrooms etc) to prevent germs from getting me more sick.... I'm not a survivor YET, but my sister had bc years ago and is doing great and my mom had it 30 years ago!! she is a survivor too! going strong at 84 with no reoccurances!! I know MANY personal friends who are survivors too...be strong!! you can do this!! ((hugs))",

I am going to get a wig (next weekend hopefully, my insurance covers it) I definitely want to wear one for work (I'm a teacher and don't really plan on telling my students unless they ask..its high school) I have a few head scarfs (pre tied) in my Amazon cart, plus a cotton hat... Just wondering what everyone else is planning...and if you have something already, do you like it? hate it? reviews are welcome. I did sign up for a free head scarf from www.GoodWishesScarves.org It won't arrive for 4-6 weeks, but if anyone needs one go request a scarf! My sister also recommended www.FightingPretty.org and www.lookgoodfeelbetter.org they have classes you can attend and they give you free makeup and teach you how to use it...all for cancer patients. Hope this can help someone else :-)",

I've been feeling pretty good after my first taxotere....(a week ago last friday) so im on week 2, and I actually feel \"normal\" I don't even feel as tired as I did in the past...my only issue is my taste buds, nothing tastes good. I met with my surgeon last friday, she was SO happy to see that she could not feel my lump at all anymore! a 5cm lump totally gone (as long as we can feel for now) We discussed my double mastectomy, most likely about 3-4 weeks after my last chemo, so that should bring me into April at some point. I\"m hoping it can be before my spring break at school so I don't have to be out of work as long. The plastic surgeons should be contacting me soon to make an appointment with them, once we do that we can set a surgery date. She did say that she doesn't think I will need radiation, but of course my MO thinks otherwise...so we will discuss this more. I have no lymph nodes involved..... How is everyone feeling this week? To those of you getting chemo this week....good luck!! you've got this! Becky",

Like I've said before get the Neulasta on your belly and it gives less bone pain...otherwise heating pads and hot baths help immensely. My MO also said I could take Advil/Motrin...but check with your own dr before taking that yourself. In the Nov group we also started a FB group and it is SO much easier to navigate and respond...you guys should definitely do it. BUT we also post in our group on here too, since we had some women who did not want to switch and thats fine :-) I did the Look Good Feel Better program and its AWESOME!! They teach you how to do your make up, they give you a HUGE bag of high end make up...Mine also had wigs, hats, scarves :-) they give you free ones if you need/want them. They also gave each of us prayer shawls. Definitely sign up in your area. ",

I find that a positive attitude and trying to keep your life a \"normal\" as possible is best at keeping yourself feeling pretty good. Of course listen to your body, rest when you need to and tell your MO when you have any pain or issues that bother you a lot, or make you unable to function...they always seem to have a \"bag of tricks\" to help make you feel better. Irisheyes31, I am also 46, and the AC was not bad at all....really, I don't even have a port, I just use my veins for all treatments ( I didn't have any surgery yet) I had the Neulasta on body injector...and only had minimal aches and soreness about 24 hours after it goes off....hot baths and advil helped with that. I had it placed on my belly...I had it on my arm for my first treatment and had WAY worse pain...so thats something to think about, not sure its related. I also take Claritin from chemo day for at least 6 days after. Good Luck ladies! we are all Warriors!!",

Once you head gets sore, cut it short, I even had him buzz it, it felt MUCH better after that....also make sure you have a soft cotton cap to wear to sleep....and a wig ready to go. I also bought a soft cap to wear under my wig, wearing it with nothing was too scratchy/itchy. So yea, minimal SE with AC....the day of infusion I was fine, day 2, I was also fine...my Neulasta onbody went off about 3:30-4:30... day 3 I would have some aches, pain from the shot..nothing too too bad, I would take advil, use some heat on parts. It felt like the flu body aches. I would get the shot put on my belly (I learned after putting it on my arm once...that time I had horrible bone pain) I also took the Claritin from day 1 for at least 5 days. after that I was usually pretty good, just tired, took naps after work most day. I would always take the Zofran (anti nausea) pill like clockwork! don't give yourself a chance to feel sick! I would do that for 5 days...but it does cause constipation so prepare for that....drink lots of water! rest when you need to....by the time my second week rolled around I felt totally normal, minus hair LOL",

It is possible if your dr thinks you have \"good veins\". My MO was the one who said I didn't need a port, and he said we can always revisit lt later if we needed to...my veins have been pretty good. I did have one \"harden\" after they used that same vein 2 chemos in a row (with AC) they probably should have rotated...but oh well, its not bad...now they rotate each chemo to a different vein, back and forth between arms (I did not have surgery yet) if you had surgery already you are better off with a port since they can't use your surgery side arm. Good luck to all of you starting out soon!! The actual chemo day is not that bad...very uneventful LOL I had very minimal side effects so far through all of this, pretty much just very tired, my advice, take the nausea meds like clockwork!! keep that under control...drink lots of water and fluids (soup etc) and rest when you feel you need to. Take a stool softner or Senokot starting the day before chemo, constipation has been the worst during all of this! If you get Neulasta, take the claritin to help with the bone pain.....I also found that getting the on body put on my belly made me have way less side effects (the first chemo I had it on my arm....HORRIBLE bone pain that time) I am working through this whole ordeal (teacher) and I swear keeping my routine as \"normal\" as possible has been great at keeping me positive (and helps the time go by faster) I also have 3 kids who keep me busy, another reason I try to keep things as normal as possible... I have only had to miss work for my chemo days or dr appts...I think I missed 1 day for just not feeling great..... Good luck to all of you!!! You've got this!!",

This weekend I have felt great (chemo #2 was Friday) late this afternoon I could feel the muscle/bone pain starting...it just feels like my skin is bruised all over ugh....but if this is the worst I get I'll take it! I'm just so happy I don't have the bad headaches this time around... I hope everyone else had a nice weekend! Becky ",

It sucks that my ride will be an hour each way....but it will most likely not start until my summer break starts (I'm a teacher) which is good I guess.. I will have my surgery at the end of April, then recouperation...he said I can't start rads until my expanders are totally full anyway, so that will bring me to the end of June..*sigh* this process is soooo long! add in switch to implants and it will be next January...",
