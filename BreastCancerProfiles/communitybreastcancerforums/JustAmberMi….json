Right knee started consistently bothering me several weeks ago. Then right hip... shooting pain mainly when standing and it would come and go. Now my left hip. I\u2019m 40. Just messaged my onc to get permission to go to the chiropractor. She seemed more concerned than I\u2019d expected and I just googled bone mets. Not my best move. Encouraged by all of the long term survival and ongoing management of mets but terrified if I\u2019m going to be truthful. I am a single mom of 2 boys and already exhausted. How would I do this... again? ",
