First, my heart and prayers go out to all of you going through breast cancer, and those who are worried, wondering, and waiting for results. All of you are remarkable. I pray that all of you get the answers you want and are healed. I have been having a horrible stabbing pain that comes and goes in my left breast where my nipple is. Even in the shower it hurts. No I am not pregnant, no its not any kind of pain I've ever had in my breast during PMS or menstrating or any other time. There is not any discoloration of the nipple or breast. I had a great mammogram early last summer. I did a self check today and felt nothing. It doesn't hurt to touch (except when shower water was hitting it), as much as these shooting sharp pains affect it. Am I worrying about nothing? Thanks, Kathy Log in to post a reply",
