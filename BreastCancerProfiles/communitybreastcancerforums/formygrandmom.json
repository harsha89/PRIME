She is on Letrozole and the skin mets seem to get better and so does the lump in her breast.She has a lymphnode in her arm pit that comes and goes and the doctor says it will get better once the skin mets get better. I dont understand why she said something like that Iam wondering if the armpit lymph node is really connected to the skin mets. I definitely want her to get better even though she is 82 years old. Any suggestions would be of great help...I hate to see her suffer. Deeps Log in to post a reply",
