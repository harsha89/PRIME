Yes, the first oncologist have sent her to onco type test which haven't got the result back yet, but the 2nd oncologist was disagreeing with the onco type test, as he was saying since 1/3 lymph node is positive, she needs to start on 3 different types of chemo after her 2nd surgery, which is very confusing as they have contraindicated ideas!",

My mom is stage II as well, ER+/PR+, HER2-, she is 56 years old. Thank you for all the positive stories.  She got diagnosed on 10/27/2011, had one unsuccessfull surgery (margin is still positive) couple of weeks ago. needs another surgery, which is not schedualed till 2nd week of January! Had two opposite ideas from 2 different oncologist regarding chemo. Waiting time and different oponions are making us more worried and anxious! For Her2- ladies, did you have to do chemo? The first oncologist who she saw ordered onco-type testing to see if she needs chemo or not! according to my search onco type testing is for node negative, the 2nd oncologist sugested 3 cycles of chemo (AC followed by taxotere). We are so confused and the worse is the wating time from the time that she got diagnosed till now she hasn't got the complete treatments yet, it is too scary for me and her. Can someone please tell me how long did it take for you to start chemo after diagnosis? ",

Most likely she would need a chemo, but the regimen that the 2nd oncologist was suggesting was AC followed by another chemo medication which I don't remember the name, but as the BC was telling us and also my own research the Adryomycin in no longer recommended for the early stage breast cancer as the bad effect it has on heart. It seems like we have do a consultation with a 3rd oncologist as soon as they would give us appointment, which probably would be 1st or 2nd week of January regarding the chemo regimen. The worse part is the waiting time! it's been 2 months since she got diagnosed and still haven't start the treatments, which makes us more worried and nervous.",
