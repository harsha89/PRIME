Now I have my followup tomorrow and I am worrying again. The radiologist doesn't like the way the lump looks. This time I am not worrying as much because it really doesn't help much. You get yourself all worked up and it very well be all over nothing. Everyone will tell you not to worry because really there is nothing else they can say. But just try to keep busy.",

With such a deep family history your mind just starts wondering to places that it shouldn't. I was in a dark place earlier today and despartely seeking advice. I am not going there anymore! I refuse to let this consume me!  I am having a core biopsy on Tuesday. I pray for negative results. I have spoken to my aunt and she is more than willing to seek genetic counseling with me and my sisters. My aunt did not have any children. I have always been terrified of this disease after seeing my mother suffer so much and ultimately losing the battle. Well I shouldn't say she lost - she was a great woman who lived her life in an exemplary fashion. I only pray I can be half the mother she was to my children. Thank you for the advice - I am definitely doing genetic counseling. No one has ever suggested a high risk MRI...do you know if that is something that I can request from my doctor who ordered the mammogram?",

My surgeon also did an ultrasound on the left breast and stated that the tissue looked good over there and the lump looked like a cyst. Nothing to worry about. I told him about my back pain and he said it was probably stress about the biopsy. He suggested that I see a genetic counselor in the near future to put some of my worries to rest. That was my plan but....this back pain is still there some 3 weeks later. I went to my primary doctor and he gave me some back exercises and told me to take Advil. I really don't feel like I need Advil. The pain is not really bad - it more like a dull achy feeling that just will not go away. I have since had it in my neck, lower back, and hip. I went back to my primary and insisted on some type of scan - it just doesn't feel musclular to me. So he ordered a spine x-ray. That came back and said I have moderate degeneration in my C-5. So he says that is what is causing my pain. Well I looked on the Internet and it said that the majority of people have some degeneration - it comes with age. I am 42 and a little over weight. I also read that disease usually attacks the C-5 and on the left side - which makes me wonder if this is more than what I've been told. I am not satisfied with his findings. I have decided to see how it goes over the next couple of weeks. Can anyone tell me what bone mets feels like? Which test should I request...I am thinking MRI will disprove any mets. Also would a spine x-ray show bone mets?",

I have 2 sisters and 3 female cousin and we have all lost our mothers to BC - they were sisters. I figured out of the 6 of us at least one of us will probably get BC. I think I am leading the pack since I had my cycle early and my kids late. But I have been vigilant with my testing. I refuse to let this ugly disease consume me or take my joy of living. It is just discouraging when you have doctors who are not on your side. Up to this point my primary care of 10 years has been great. I rarely see him as I am generally a healthy person. Now I come with this back pain that came from no where and he seems to think its stress or this disc generation. But with my family history I believe it is worth getting an MRI. I have had this back pain for over a month now and I don't recall any physical activity that could have bought this on. Furthermore it doesn't feel muscular to me - it feels like my bones. Something I've never felt before. The fact that the onset was from no where and it is basically my left side is making me worry. I don't know what it is but I am not buying the disc degeneration theory. It may not be cancer but what is it? I wonder because I just had a mammo in February and ultrasound on both breast in March. I wonder if it could have been missed. I think an MRI would give us a better idea of what is going on.",
