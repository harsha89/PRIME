I don't know anything about the Hickman Catheter.  From what I can find on Google, it looks like it has external tubing.  It would seem if that is the case, you wouldn't have to have a needle through the skin for access.  I guess the draw back would be the external tubing always being there.

As for tx #2, I may be starting a little neuropathy on one finger.  Not real sure yet, just a different feeling.  I'm drinking prune juice twice a day (I started the day before tx #2) to keep the consipation away.  I hope it works.

I was liking it!  Now...they are what they were before chemo.  So I didn't lose them all...just settled into what I had before...bleh.  But they are mine...all mine, thank you very much.",

I wish you all good luck and minimal side effects.  Tell your Onc about ALL of your aches/pains/concerns (no matter how small you think they are).  There is so much out there available to minimize the effects of what chemo can do to our bodies.",

I have no idea on the nodes issue.  I know they have some formula they work through to determine the stage and grade.  I've had to have the doctor explain it so many times because I was corrolating the grade with the nodes activity and it just doesn't work that way.  My grade was 3 but my node involvement was 1/8 and the one was very much micromet.  I was trying to go back to the beginning of our threads to find your original posts...did you have CT/PET scans or anything like that?  Those would be ones that I would say...If they were done, should they have detected the mets then? ",

On a more positive note, the weekend following treatment #3 seems to have been a bit easier.  While I was still tired, I wasn't so exhausted it brought tears to my eyes, like last time.  This was a relief.  It makes me wonder (because I like to know why and how things work) if my elevated WBC contributed to less dramatic s/e's.  On treatment day my WBC was 12.2...doctor said it was my body fighting my cold and nothing to be concerned about.  I just wonder if it gave me an advantage over the drastic drop chemo induces.  I hope everyone has had a good and uneventful weekend! ~Adrienne",

And don't even get me going on the FDA?  This is a huge reason why I don't like to take medication.  All these things we find out too late.  Pain has to be really bad for me to even take an Advil.  I'm at the point I trust Tylenol...I hope it stays that way.

Kerry - Happy Belated Birthday! Deoderant - throughout treatment, if I remembered through chemo brain, I used Arm & Hammer Essentials...Aluminum and Paraben Free.  I actually like it.  No obnoxious perfume.  In fact several of my nurses over time commented on how nice I smelled (I hope they weren't feeding me a line...lol) Linda - I have started on Arimidex.  I'm (let me count)...twelve days in and have no problem so far.  That excludes the ridiculous packaging that you can't get in to take your damn medicine to save your FREAKING life.  Seriously, so far so good but it hasn't been that long.  Chemo induced early onset to menopause so Tamoxifen was taken off the table as an option.  That was fine with me. I went out for the very first time without a head covering yesterday.  My DH was so proud of me.  We headed out to Costco and it was totally packed!  I forgot I was bald and just enjoyed, as I always do (damn I love that store).  Anywho, I have a good amount of growth on my head.  You can still see my shiny head but really there is alot of hair.  Both dark and light.  I can't tell if the light is blonde or gray.  I'm praying for blonde.  Please, Please, Please!  Haven't I been through enough?? But what is up with the eyebrows and eyelashes?  My eyebrows have continued their departure and I finally lost the last of them this week.  Hair on head grows while I lose the rest of my face.  Now..yes, it was traumatic losing my hair but somehow you didn't look \"sick\" with eyebrows.  Now I have hair coming in but no eyebrows and I look like I have cancer. *sigh*  This too shall pass but darnit I want to GET past it.  I am, however, totally pleased with no armpit hair and shaving my legs every 3 weeks or so. I feel fabulous!  I am filling up my time with learning how to crochet, learning Photoshop for my website project, learning how to BUILD a website, and just generally trying to enjoy life.  I want to learn to make chemo caps because the colder months are coming and frankly I was cold this summer with my bald head.  I am going to donate them to my Onc's office in hopes that some ladies can use them at home.  Nothing obnoxious but nice enough to keep heads warm.  My website is www.projectbreastcancer.org .  I haven't gotten anywhere as I'm learning HOW to but the idea came from when I was first diagnosed and how worried I was about my family and how I thought they needed as much support as I did.  So now I'm scrambling to make it a reality with no knowledge whatsoever  .  I'll get there. I hope everyone is feeling good and keeping their heads up! Hugs to you all....~Adrienne",

Certainly glad to hear that you are in good spirits! I'm not happy to hear about this Crest Pro Health story.  I began using this last week....now what to do?  The last thing we ladies need is brown stains on our teeth on top of everything else! I think today is the day I start losing my hair...day 17 from first treatment.  Had a few strands in my fingers when I combed through this morning.  I held on to it longer than I thought I would. I feel good today.  I hope to have more energy and am aiming to go see Indiana Jones tomorrow with my family.  They are all chomping at the bit to see it. I hope everyone has a relaxing and s/e free weekend. ~Adrienne",

As already stated, everyone responds differently to tx.  For me, the AC resulted in terrible fatigue.  By day 6 after tx, I felt mostly normal.  The first few tx, I had the burps.  Mostly just irritating and not enough to really gripe about.  Loss of taste buds was an issue as well....again mostly just irritating.  With the Taxol, I've got my tastebuds back. I have lost a little over 10 lbs since I started chemo.  I had already been doing Weight Watchers since October and I continued to follow that through my chemo.  I know some gain, some lose and some stay the same.  Some of the gains may be in response to meds (like the steroids), some could be the cravings for not so healthy foods, since the tastebuds are so screwed up.  I was too stubborn to give in since I worked so hard to lose my weight! The chances of not losing your hair are pretty slim.  I know we all like to hope we'd be one of the very few that don't and it may very well be the one thing in this whole process that is the hardest to deal with.  It just plain sucks.  I did buy a wig through the American Cancer Society http://www.tlcdirect.org/depts/dept-1.html but I really just don't like it and have never worn it and never will.  So I stick with my skull caps and my hats.  There are some really great skull caps at http://sparklingearth.com/ . I started losing my hair about 3 or 4 days after AC #2.  Buzzed my head at the point when it was just getting too thin and looking totally unhealthy.  I probably still have about 10% left of my buzzed hair.  I'm a chia pet in early stages ;) . You should be able to attend your friends wedding.  Just make sure you take care of yourself, stay away from people with colds, etc.  I've been to the zoo, a casino and tonight (with my Oncs okay) I'm going to a public pool with my family.  By September you should have a good idea of how you are feeling and how you are responding to certain things. YAY! on getting the drain removed!  I surely hated that thing. Since you've been reading the boards for a while you may have already seen this, but just in case you didn't..check out the tips for getting through chemo threads pinned to the top of the message board.  It is an awesome list of tips and must haves.  ~Adrienne",

I am the rechargeable battery, my couch is the charger.  The charger is faulty because it only gives me short bursts of battery life at a time.  An hour or two on the charger gives me 15 minutes of battery life - \"Ok...I think I can do something\". I hope you're able to get some energy back real soon.  Make sure you are getting in good meals and drink lots of water.  Water is key, in my opinion. ~Adrienne",

I also read, I think the last page, that you are concerned going into Taxol.  I can so relate!  I just wanted to share that, so far, it has been so much easier for me.  I didn't get the exhaustion which I so hated with AC.  I have had some bone pain, started Saturday and had some yesterday and last night.  I didn't get the bone pain with Neulasta so I was kind of surprised that I did with Taxol.  Honestly, I'll take it over the exhaustion.  I think Rock is getting Neulasta with her Taxol...I'm not.  Interesting, the different strategies.  I also take Decadron 12 and 6 hours before treatment, as well as getting it infused with the chemo. I know everyone is different but I just wanted to ease your fears as much as possible. Randie and Rock - I hope you are both doing better today.  I'm anxious to hear what the dear doctors say about your current situations! ~Adrienne Dx 4/3/2008, IDC, 2cm, Stage IIb, Grade 3, 1/8 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2-",

Its hard, isn't it?..... When you have to make decisions like this because there is no definitive from the medical community. ",

Rock, I'm sorry that your end date has to move.  I'm sure, like me, you have that date clearly marked.  But you're right...at least you're tx will continue and that is good news!  I was told, by my Onc, that there is nothing that YOU can do to boost your RBC. Jean - Taxol was SOOOOOOOOOOOOO much better for me!  I had some bone pain in my legs that lasted about two days, on days 4 & 5 following tx).  Were better if I was up and moving around and wasn't really bad enough for me to complain too much.  I didn't have any fatigue, no weird taste in my mouth, no fogginess, normal appetite.  Its been amazingly wonderful these last two weeks.  I sure hope today's tx and the next two follow this same path.

DH shaved my head Friday morning.  He is such a trooper.  It feels so much better than having the loose hair falling out in large quantities and walking around with hordes of hair attached to my clothing.  And Rock is right...showers are so fast!  I do feel better about it than I thought I would. That being said, I'm not quite at the Rock the Bald state of mind.  I'm fine within the confines of my own house but not out in public.  Not yet. Now I have a cold to get rid of by Wednesday.  No matter how hard I tried not to get my sons cold, it just didn't work.  I assume if I'm not running a fever and my bloodwork is good that it won't be a problem having treatment.  I'm just glad I got it during my good week and not the few days following last treatment.

On the whole weight thing - Between steroids, water retention and all the other crap we're dealt...weight gain is completely normal.  I haven't gained weight because I'm too damn stubborn.  I've worked hard to lose the 64 lbs I lost between Oct - May.  I'm damned if I'm going to let this crap put any of it back on!  One of the things my Onc mentioned last week was that my blood sugar was up and that the steroids will cause that.  When your blood sugar is elevated, you body tells you that you are hungry.  He indicated that often that contributes to weight gain during chemoooooooo.  Has anyone noticed elevated blood sugars? Sue - I'd personally like to slap the On-Call Onc upside the head with a smelly trout.  Seriously.   Lets just scare this woman half to death and make her sit the whole weekend and worry away until Monday when she can be seen.  You just sit back, put those feet up, drink plenty of fluids ( I know odd) and watch some good movies.    Me?  I'm 44 ... ugh",

Treatment went well today.  It was the busiest its every been in the chemo room.  Crazy busy.  My HGB is up to 11.1 (YAY!), Onc still elected to do the Aranesp just to keep it going.  My WBC is down to 2.8 .  He had said last time that he didn't think it would drop enough to do Neulasta.  However, just to cover my bases, I refilled my Neulasta prescription because my pharmacy doesn't carry it as a standard stock.  So today when I told him that I had ordered it, he still felt that I wasn't going to need it...then he looked at my numbers and said Yep, Neulasta.  I so wanted to stick my tongue out at him and say \"I told you so\".  But I love my Onc and he just hasn't learned, as my DH has, that I'm always right! ;) Karin - LOVE the pics!  Did anybody tip ya? LOL And congrats on your last T/C.  Celebration time! Another patient completed her final tx today.  The staff presented her with a non-alcoholic bottle of champagne in celebration.  As she left, we all clapped and congratulated her on her graduation.  MY last tx is 8/13...WOOHOOHOO!!  I can't wait! For those on the fence/gray area regarding radiation.  Talked to my Onc about it today.  He explained it this way (I also had DCIS).  If you look at an apple and it has a large brown bruise...that is the IDC.  Then you see that it has brown spots around the rest of the apple...that is the DCIS.  The DCIS is separate from the IDC, isn't formed from, or related to, the IDC.  They are their own little buttheads hoping  to make their own IDC party.  This just put a bit more perspective on the situation, especially since I hadn't put any thought into the DCIS and assumed that it was part of the IDC.  I was focused on the lymph nodes and the fact that only one had the tiniest spec of invasion.  So at this point, I'm leaning more towards doing the radiation.  DH and I will discuss it a bit more.  I hope this makes sense and helps those of you that are in my same gray situation. Linda - good luck tomorrow at the lake!  I HAVE to ask and pray...did you make up an arbitrary dollar figure on the Taxol???  Please say that you did.  I haven't seen any paperwork on it yet as they haven't submitted the charges to insurance yet.  I was pleasantly surprised and pleased with the A/C charges. Sable - My leg hair has been inconsistant.  Through A/C I had to shave twice a week but had no armpit hair at all (YAY).  Then right after A/C, my leg hair was gone.  About 2 weeks later, I felt some stubble and looked real close and saw light colored hair coming in (I have dark hair).  I shaved it and hasn't come back yet.  I never did lose all of my head hair.  I have some new growth and some older tough ones that refused to go.  I do lose some of that off and on, but again its inconsistant.  I'm a baby chia pet or maybe a brillo pad. Gracie - What a small world!  How cool is that?  You get to meet up with an old friend (a best one to boot) all because you were in tx.  Good things can happen during chemo! Jean and Rock - how are you doing this evening?  Hope all is well.",

Or, if you're close to menopause, tamoxifen may push you over the edge and stop your periods. Some ovarian function might still persist in this case, but not enough for you to have periods. For complete ovarian shutdown in a pre-menopausal woman, Zoladex is usually needed to make the ovaries stop working. Depending on the situation, your doctor may recommend only tamoxifen without full ovarian shutdown. Or your doctor might recommend both tamoxifen and Zoladex. In post-menopausal women, the ovaries are already shut down, so tamoxifen alone is enough. Or your doctor might prescribe an aromatase inhibitor instead of tamoxifen. \"",

I do think activity plays a part in the degree/severity of the neuropathy.  I mentioned to DH this morning how this last tx seemed to be worse than the prior two, as far as the achy/numbness, and the only thing we did different was forego our nightly walks this week.  Besides a couple of days of bad weather, I have no excuse for not walking.  This is my punishment.  Shame on me!  We walk tonight! My Onc did say that the neuropathy would be more pronounced the further into the Taxol tx I get so that is probably part of it.  In addition, I did get a Neulasta shot this last round.  So its hard to say if its a combination of all or any one thing.  But I'm blaming myself and the lack of exercise.  Mostly because I can control that part!

When I wear my sports bra, with a shirt or sweater that doesn't make it obvious, I forget about it all.   But that really limits my clothing.  Oh I'm whining..........

So here I am, planning a trip to Florida to see my parents for the first time in 3 years (before diagnosis). While others are proudly sharing their bra colors, in support of I DON'T KNOW WHAT, I'm praying that my next two (that is how many I have) Onc appointments before I leave for Florida, are clean.  Fretting over having to deal with this shit again before I get to see my parents and reassure them that I'm okay. *sigh*  Self pity, eh?  This just irritated me.  Sorry.  And I've had such a good day getting my plane reservations.  Imagine what I'd be like if I didn't have a good day?  Scary thought.",

Lisa - where did they put the port?  I had my left breast mastectomy and port insertion (on the right side of my chest) done at the same time.  The port was more uncomfortable than the mast side but over time, as the swelling decreased, so did the discomfort.  Now, its just there.  I have full range of motion. Roxi - So glad to hear from you!  That exhaustion is the pits.  It hit me day 3, a little less on day 4...then good from then on.  I hope the same happens to you.  I didn't experience constipation but I think (at least this is my opinion) its because part of my daily \"diet\" is to have 2 tsp of olive oil in my food (usually my eggbeaters in the morning).  I also eat a good amount of fiber and drink TONS of water.  All combined, I think it has helped.  Maybe you could try adding a tsp of olive oil to a yogurt or something where you won't notice its in there.  Either way, I sure hope you get some relief soon! Welcome Pepper - I don't have any answers for you on the fluid.  Its possible that a little fluid build up after having the drains removed is normal.  I can't imagine that they would've removed them if they weren't ready to come out.  It never hurts to call them and find out, which is probably what I would do. ~Adrienne",

I need to look into the Look Good, Feel Better class.  I've seen lots of positive comments on it.  Let us know how it goes. I can't answer the work related question, since I'm a \"domestic engineer\" for the moment.  I will say that this afternoon, I'm pretty tired and couldn't imagine being able to sit at work.  The chemo session went very well and I had plenty of energy when I got home.  The tiredness just kind of snuck up on me.  Its possible that some of it is just from the stress of worrying about the chemo.

Carla - I'm so sorry to hear the indigestion won't go away.  Have you tried something as simple as Tums?  I'm sure there are a ton of products out there....I have no idea what is best.  I had horrible burps and the Pepcid worked for me.  I hope you can get some relief. ~Adrienne",

It sounds like you have great support at school and I hope your son will go to those people if he needs them.  Kids can be so mean.  Boys early on and girls later.  I've got one of those sensitive young men.

It sounds like everyone is doing very well!  Rock...congrats on the wig!  I received mine about 1 1/2 weeks ago and its still in its packaging .  I guess I should get it washed and set on its styrofoam head soon. I have to read back in detail to catch up on everyone.  I scratched my cornea so haven't been able to sit at a computer for more than a minute but I've scanned through the posts as much as I can in those brief periods. Collector, I hope your port install went well.  You'll appreciate having it, for sure.  For those who started treatment this week/today...I hope all is good for you. I had my follow up blood work today (1 week post treatment).  Everything looks good and the Neulasta did its job.  While my WBC was a tad below normal, it would've been much worse without the Neulasta. Happy, positive thoughts to you all. ~Adrienne",

Cristine - my son is also 8 (his two siblings are much older 18 and 21).  He doesn't fully understand as well he shouldn't, in my opinion.  They just know that we have to go through horrible things to make sure we get better.  It must be confusing to wrap their thoughts around how mommy has to feel horrible sick to get better.  That just doesn't make any logical sense.  I'd like to think that it doesn't occupy much of his thoughts, but it sadly it does and I hate that.  He'll just out of the blue say something like \"I wish you didn't have to do chemo\" or \"I wish you didn't have to have breast cancer\".   He had a cold this last weekend, which just happened to be those first few days after treatment.  Those spontaneous hugs and kisses couldn't be.  That was hard on both of us. He did get one benefit this weekend, however.  His school bus driver showed up at the house with the makings for French Dip sandwiches and chips.  She had asked him what his favorite dinner was and bless her heart she stopped by with this awesome treat.  He was so excited.  We will make sure that over the summer, the off treatment weeks will be super special.  This will NOT ruin his summer. OK...I think I've officially rambled.  Guess I am feeling a bit more energy today ;) In short - rockthebald...your mom is awesome and I applaud her strength.  Just thinking 32 years ago how different the treatments were and how so much less was known about this disease and the treatment needed....and you remember being a happy 10 year old.  I bow to her................... ~Adrienne",

RanD - Welcome to May!  Looks like you will fit right in! ;) Kristy - I too will be attending the Look Good Feel Better class next Monday.  I'm actually looking forward to it. I've been steadily losing my hair since Saturday morning.  I haven't had the guts to shave it yet.  Luckily I had alot, so at this point its just looking thinner.  I'm sure in the next day or two, I'll have to take that particular plunge.  My son (he's 8) is watching and waiting.  I can just see those glances every once in a while...just waiting and wondering what mommy will look like with no hair.  A little worried too. This time around I have had more bone pain than the first round.  Tolerable but inconvenient.  It makes me wonder why a particular area experiences bone pain and others don't.  What is this indicative of? (can I end a sentence with of?).  My bone pain is only in my right arm (not the arm I get the Neulasta shot in) and mostly focused on my wrist.  How does the bone pain pick and choose its location?  Just curious. I hope everyone has a great S/E free (or at least mild) Tuesday!  I think I will finally have a good amount of energy today...finally. ~Adrienne",

Being a message board, and not a chat room, you can't tell who is online and who isn't.  I read often during the day, others might read the messages every few hours.  Usually you will see activity at all times of day and night. I'm across the water from you in Bremerton.  Last Wednesday was my 2nd round of A/C (4 rounds dense dose A/C followed by 4 rounds dense dose of Taxol), my hair started to fall out on Saturday (basically day 17 from first treatment) and continues its mass exodus still.  I too noticed a change in texture the week before it started coming out.  It seemed stiffer and not as much body.  We are all on that same emotional roller coaster.  I never did like roller coasters!  When it seems like you have got your mind wrapped around one thing, you then have to face another.  For me, I think hair loss is my current dilemma and I just can't bring myself to shave it off because then its \"out there\" and something that I can't pretend doesn't exist.  And frankly, I don't think I'll look good bald. I don't have dry mouth.  I don't know for sure if it has to do with how much water I drink but I believe it does.  I drink a minimum of 70 ounces of water every day.  Chemo day, its more like 115 ounces.  At least 32 of those ounces is during chemo.   I also use Biotine toothpaste, which is supposed to help with dry mouth. Please post often.  We are all here for each other.  I have learned so much from these message boards. ~Adrienne",

I take this away from it :  \"A large percentage of cancer patients undergoing active treatment take supplemental antioxidants in addition to a daily multivitamin-multimineral preparation probably with the belief that, at the very worst, they can do no harm. However, more research is needed before definitive positive or negative advice can be given about the use of antioxidant dietary supplements as adjuncts to cancer chemotherapy or radiotherapy. It is recommended that a daily multivitamin-multimineral supplement containing quantities at the levels of the DRI can be used safely as part of a program of healthy nutrition. Taking dietary supplements containing levels of nutrients with antioxidant properties much greater than the DRI is not recommended during chemotherapy because higher levels may have adverse effects and interfere with efficacy of treatment. Patients should not be discouraged from taking folic acid at the level of the RDA because this has many other benefits for health.\" From what I can gather, the concern is the supplements that people take above and beyond the RDA.  Vitamin C tabs, etc.  I think I am safe with Fred and Wilma but I will still address this concern with my Onc.  On the other hand, I know that I have a well balanced daily diet (thank you Weight Watchers) and wonder if I really even need to take a supplement...chemo or not.  Something to ponder. ~Adrienne",

Know that you WILL get through this.  Rely on the support you have around you.  Take the offers of help every chance you get.  Good luck!",
