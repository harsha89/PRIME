I lost all my hair, packed on abt 10 kolos due to the cortesone I took. then I was clean for 3 years then it appeared at exactly the same spot as before, this time I got herceptin with Taxotere...lost my hair again and piled on the kilo's again thanks to cortosone again. Then another two years later and this time I am being treated for a mark on my back bone. It was first clasified as artheritis and when my cancer count went up and that mark became bigger, I was put on Navelbine and Herceptin. I have a dripping nose, I get mussle spasm, and I am getting panic attacks. I started crying this morning for no apparent reason. I think I am just scared. And I think that is most of our reasons. I saw a friend die last year of cancer, and he did everything right, He lived healthy, he exersised, and in the end he was butchered. He got a very high fever from the chemo, was admitted to the hospital, he then was sticked with a needle as big as a stick through his ribcage, and afterwards he was in such pain. His spirit was broken, he came back as a shadow of the guy that went in. I have to agree with you.,. if you feel that your quality of life is being threatened, I would also stop and rather live life everyday as if it was your last one.",
