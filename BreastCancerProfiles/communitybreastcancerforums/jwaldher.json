The doctor told me that I was wearing the wrong type of bra but that she would schedule an ultrasound just in case. The ultrasound came back \"suspicious\" with no definite answers. My husband encouraged me to get a second opinion,which I did. The second doctor just sent me to a surgeon. My surgeon said let's take it (the lump/mass) out and put it in a jar. She said that it isn't part of my body so let's remove it and then find out what it is. I thought that this was a great idea. So last Friday she removed it. Only to find out that it was a 1.3 cm cancerous mass! Well I'm shocked, my surgeon is shocked, and my husband is shocked! I met with her today, my surgeon, and we reviewed the path lab report. Apparently I had a grade 3 IDC with DCIS. She reviewed my options and gave her recommendations. I've decided to have a double masectomy. I'm curious to know what other with BC women think? Are their any others my age who have had this? What would you do? The reasons I've chosen the double masectomy are simple. I'm young with an aggresive form of cancer. I've my whole life to live so I'm not letting my boobs take me out early Also I have small boobies so thereisn't much to remove anyways I do not want to have years of worrying and wondering. Just take my boobies now and my margin of cancer reoccuring is very small.    Dx 7/22/2011, IDC, 1cm, Stage I, Grade 3 Log in to post a reply",

It think that I'm still in shock. I feel really numb and lack energy. I cry on and off through the day. What books/videos have you found to be encouraging? where did you go for support? is there a support network at the SCCA?",
