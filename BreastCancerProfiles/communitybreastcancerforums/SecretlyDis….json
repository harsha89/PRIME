I know I will greatly appreciate them during chemo. I live in the country on a dirt road. No neighbors. I walk everyday now and plan to continue if I can. I do yoga everyday too am hoping to be able to keep up with that. We shall see. From what the dr told me I may very well not feel up to it. I will plan to go to the grocery store at times that aren\u2019t busy as well. There is no option to delivering groceries since I live out in the boonies. Lol I have to drive 45 minutes just to get to the grocery store. Thank you for the encouraging words! I really appreciate it a lot! I hope today finds you feeling halfway decent. Many hugs to you!

Just a week ago I had NO IDEA I would have to do chemo. Nobody told me until my appointment with the medical oncologist the serious nature of the cancer I have. I originally was told I\u2019d probably get surgery and MAYBE radiation therapy. So when I was told I had to do chemo and it needed to start right away, I was thrown for a loop. And apparently it didn\u2019t sink in for me, the aggressiveness of the triple negative tumor. I was wondering about the sleepiness too, since I\u2019m already so sleepy all the time. I worry I\u2019ll just be knocked out for the next 6 months. Lol I guess I will find out. Did you by any chance take Zyprexa for nausea? I guess I\u2019m supposed to take it for the first 4 days after chemo. I\u2019m worried about that because I know that\u2019s a very sedating drug.",

An online community will be pretty much the only human contact I will be getting because I was informed I will be immune compromised. I even have to take a leave from my job for that reason. So when I say all alone I mean all alone literally. I have gone thru extremely difficult times all alone in the past. Chemo, however, seems like it will be more than I can handle. On the other hand, maybe I\u2019m just having too much of an emotional reaction to the situation",

I\u2019m stuck on a few of them tho. I haven\u2019t had surgery yet so some of the questions don\u2019t apply to me. I have to get my pathology report too to answer some of the more detailed questions. I have one tumor that\u2019s ER+, one that\u2019s PR+, one tumor that\u2019s HER2 positive and one that\u2019s triple negative. Of course it\u2019s the triple negative that the dr is worried about the most. I appreciate your explanation because I was under the impression that chemo for me is more of a preventative measure. Also am so very sorry you were alone with young twins when you went thru chemo. I think you\u2019re a much stronger woman than I am! And here you are! You did it! That\u2019s totally amazing!",

I can\u2019t remember the exact combinations of meds off hand, but the first round of chemo will be extremely strong. I will get it once every 2 weeks for 4 times. Then I will get another round of chemo weekly with a different drug combo. I believe my last treatment will be Feb. 22, 2019. I was told it will be an extremely challenging time for me. Due to the nature of my job, working with animals, I am having to take a 6 month leave of absense because of low immunity. I was told even if that wasn\u2019t a factor, I would need assistance with lifting heavy items (which is most of my job) so I physically wouldn\u2019t be able to work anyway. This information led me to a state of panic, pretty much. Why would I want to do all that to myself when they don\u2019t REALLY know for sure if there\u2019s any Mets. But since one of my tumors is triple negative, it seems like chemo is the only option to wipe it out systemwide.",
