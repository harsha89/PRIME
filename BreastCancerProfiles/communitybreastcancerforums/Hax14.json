I'm 41 years old and had my first mammogram last Monday December 1, 2014.I got a call back the next morning and they wanted me to come back in for another mammogram and possibly an ultrasound..Which the ended up doing both. The radiologist came in during the ultrasound and explained that I had a complex cyst and then referred me to a general surgeon. Let me tell you what my ultrasound report said: At the 10 o'clock position there is a lobulated , complex cystic mass measuring 9x6x6mm. This has no internal vascularity on the color doppler evaluation and has multiple internal septations and a thickened wall. Whether this accounts for the mammographic nodular density is uncertain. Ductal dilation is noted in subareolar region. My Birard score was a 4. I met with the surgeon yesterday and he did a needle aspiration and the fluid he got out was clear and looked good. He had me do another mammogram immediately after and there was something still there but it had went down some. So I guess what I'm wondering is I thought needle aspirations were not the best for complex cyst? He wants me to have a repeat mammogram in 3 months and see what it looks like then. I'm not sure if i should get a second opinion or if all this sounds normal. Thanks so much for taking your time to read this. Its going to be a long 3 months:( Log in to post a reply",
