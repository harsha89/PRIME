After much research and many opinions, I am choosing to have a prophylactic mastectomy. My surgeon is planning the skin sparing double mastectomy with immediate reconstruction using expanders. Looks like its a go in a couple of weeks. Being a Police Officer I have a big concern about wearing my vest (approximately 7 to 10 lbs) while I am getting expanded and during the resting period prior to the exchange to implants (guess that is going to be about 12 weeks total?). I have a good tolerance for pain but I don't know what to expect. The unknown is so stressful. Any input or advice would be very appreciated. Log in to post a reply",
