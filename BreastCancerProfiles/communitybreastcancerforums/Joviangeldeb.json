My name is Debbie and I just found this wonderful site.  I look forward to meeting all of ya'll.   I went through a left modified radical mastectomy last October, started chemo in January, and am now on Arimidex for 5 years. My oncologist has given me a 79% chance. I just found out last night that one of my sisters had a breast biopsy yesterday and won't get the results until early next week.  I spoke with her and she seems to be handling it well.   Like me, she found a lump by accident and went to her doctor, which lead to mammo, u/s and biopsy.  I'm praying she'll be allright.  I plan to fly up to be with her for her surgery if her tests turn out positvie. As for me, I'm gaining strength and back to working full time.  I worked part-time during chemo.  I've steadily regained strength but the only problem I'm having is muscle and joint pain throughout my entire body.  My doctors tell me its from the Arimidex but I had it prior to starting chemo. It began shortly after I had my mastectomy.  While I was having my chemo, the pain went away as soon as I took the decadron.  But after chemo ended and I stopped taking that medication, the pain returned.  I went for a full workup with my regulare doctor and he said i don't have rheumatoid arthrtis and that he thinks its from the Arimidex.  Does anybody here have this same problem with the pain?  I'm worse in the am or if I've been sitting and then stand up.  I also have difficulty going up and down stairs or trying to lift myself up off the floor.  I don't take anything fro it except for advil because I hate to take any type of pain pills. they make me nauseas.  I have a pretty high tolerance for pain (didn't take any pain rx after my mastectomy, just  non-narcotic toradol)so I don't let it stop me from living my life.  I jsut get tired of being in constant pain and its slowed me down when I'm moving around. I feel older than I am because of it.  But it doesn't get me depressed. I've kept a positive attitude through this entire ordeal. I ignore it though, because I'd rather have this than the cancer returning.    I'm also eating like a pig. :)  My appetite has come back with a vengence.  and my oncologist told me its from the arimidex too. I'm married and live with my hubby  in Biloxi, MS.  We went through  Hurricane Katrina.  Our kids are all grown and are gone off to their own lives, so our babies are our dog, Gizmo Killer and cat, Midnight in Chelsea.  I'm back to working full-time and I'm a self employed author, involved in a critique group, judge writing contests, etc, so I keep myself very busy.   Again, I look forward to meeting ya'll, and its nice to meet you.
