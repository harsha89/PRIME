I've had a hard time \"embracing the bald\" but my friends, who luckily were the only ones in my boat, encouraged me to take off my baseball hat.  I did, kept it down by my feet, and I have to say, it was incredibly freeing.  Even got a picture of it.  I say, embrace the bald!!",

There is no way that a woman would allow another woman to go through that. If women developed the MRI machine, the holes would be padded and we would be able to wear headphones that piped in relaxing music and still allowed the tech to talk to us when they needed to. Ok, off my soap box too!!",

I got through the loss of my breast pretty well, it wasn't my favorite one anyways.  But right now my hair is coming out in large handfuls every time I touch my scalp and I find myself crying and crying.  I didn't cry that much when I was told I had to have a mastectomy - I saw it as a means to an end to get the cancer out of me. A woman I work with helped me put it into perspective.  I actually went to work for training less than 1 week after my mastectomy and have continued to work part-time every since (about 5 weeks ago).  I was worried about how people were going to handle me coming in with a wig on on Monday or a scarf. (My friends are having a Brittney Mania party for me on Sunday and we're shaving my head) She said that even though people knew I have bc, because of the way that I have been handling it, people didn't know know that I am ill but that the wig and/or scarf will be real evidence to them.  So, when I look in the mirror right now, even more so than looking at my scar, there is no denying that I have bc. AND IT SUCKS!! - there I rarely get whiny but needed it tonight because the affects of the A/C are starting to kick in.  Yipee!!  Hope this helps. PS - Oh gosh Otter, I just saw your Uncle Fester picture and died.  Halloween is huge for my family, haunted house special effects, people get in costume etc.  We have already been planning for new things for this year and just this past weekend my dad and I were talking about who I was going to be this year (I am usually the Bride of Frankenstein) and I very nonchallantly told him, I'm going to be Uncle Fester, easiest costume I ever have to come up with, and very little make-up.  So, for the past couple of days he has been sending my Uncle Fester picture.  I'll have to post them here after Halloween this year.  Too, too funny!!",

My attitude was that I needed to deal with these people for a long time and so if they had great credentials and I liked them, then they were the ones for me.  I read once that one of the most important aspects for patients is that they have faith in the team that is treating them.  I have total faith that Dr. Bedpan (his nickname because he has the bedside manner of a bedpan) and his staff are totally on my side, have my best interests at heart and will give me the best treatment available out there. ",
