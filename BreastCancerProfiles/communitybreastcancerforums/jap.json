I finished RAD in Jan. and only then realized how numb my feet were.  In late Feb.  I took Cipro for an ear infection and got a drug reaction which made the problem much worse. i am now taking vit.B6 but would like to do more to help my feet. I hear that for some people it goes away in about a year. Thanks, Jo Anne",
