My surgeon said it is fine, that this is serous fluid and some times it just takes a long time to heal, especially if the area had been treated with radiation.  In my case the cavity was filling up with this fluid ever since my lumpectomy last May. The biopsy incision gave it an escape.  For me there is nothing to do but wait for it to heal. I too went through several gause pads each day and would wake up to find my clothing soaked. It is not as bad now but still draining every day and I still have to wear gause pads but do not have to change them as often. I hope you get some relief soon.",
