I am on week 6 of Taxol - with 6 weeks left to go.  My hair fell out after my 2nd AC treatment and I just buzzed it off.  I have some peach fuzz on my head right now that is mixed in the the little stubborn hairs that never left, but I began losing my eyelashes when the Taxol began, and I have noticed that my eyebrows are thinning, too.  Some eyelashes are growing back in, now, but not quickly. About 2 weeks ago, I noticed that I suddenly had hairy legs and underarms again!  But, it was weird hair - all white and kinda like when puberty started!  lol I don't really know when to expect my hair to come back in on my head and I still wear hats!  I wish I had the courage to go bald, but I can't bring myself to do it, yet. I wish I had something more to tell you, but that is my situation!  Hope it helps!!",
