I don't have fever, pain, unusual swelling, or specific sites of redness, but my whole breast is this light pink--different than the other. I have a call in to the office, but no call-back yet. I am mainly worried because they said it may have spread to the skin when they saw some asymmetric thickening on the outside only the mammogram. (There was nothing in that area ON my skin). I don't think it would spread to ALL my skin that quickly, but it is making me a bit nervous. Should it still be red like this from the biopsy that many days ago? Needless to say, I just want to get on with treatment and get this thing out of me since it is so fast-growing. I just filled out my profile--not sure if I have that little blurb of what I have on my posts or what, but it's IDC 5 cm grade 3 triple negative. No treatment yet ... waiting for chemo appt. May 2017 MRI found 20ish small brain mets, biggest one in cerebellum. Whole brain radiation done for 3 weeks, triple negative, grade 3. Did AC and other chemo. Now doing Cisplatin for as long as it works and can handle it. Dx 10/4/2016, IDC, Right, 5cm, Grade 3, 1/1 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

The radiologist who did the tumor biopsy wasn't worried about it at the moment except to say a punch biopsy of that area should be done at surgery. I guess I was just worried because I thought the redness should be gone by now, but I suppose it may take longer.",

It started all around the same time, and it is getting worse. It is mostly in my upper extremities and my knees and 1 hip. I am 45, been dealing with muscle pain from Lyme disease for years, but this joint stiffness makes it really hard to move at times. The pain will go away after moving around. I have had deep bone pain from the Lyme, and this is a different feeling. My CT scan was clear for any mets. I am guessing it will quiet down during chemo, but I know that chemo can also CAUSE joint pain. I can't find much info, though, about joint pain and stiffness as a symptom of the cancer itself.

It would be best to ask the docs, of course, but if she doesn't have the outward signs of inflammatory breast cancer, i wouldn't think that is what they meant. But that's just my guess. It could be it was that it could be moving that way, like into the skin, but I don't understand that myself much either. I thought invasive ductal carcinoma and inflammatory cancer were different things, but then I read they could happen at the same time. It could just be a regular inflammatory immune reaction type of deal they were talking about. A lot of times if they just say an \"inflammatory condition\" that would mean there is inflammation but they don't know why. So if that was their actual words, that could mean just some generalized inflammation. Do you know if the carcinoma was considered \"in situ\"? -- those do not always turn invasive. :) But they treat them as such anyway because they can't tell which will and which won't turn that way (or when). i hope the doctor will give you answers ASAP.",

They started me on half dose, but I've been taking the full dose Talazoparib for 2 days now. My neck and shoulders are really sore, probably from the port placement?? I feel like a phython hugged my neck and shoulders and then shook me for hours. My tumor is pretty big, but today it seemed to get even bigger/harder. (It's basically my whole breast). I'm not sure if that hardening is a good thing or not. Hoping to find a local place to try on wigs. One I ordered didn't fit. Glad there is this place to visit. :). Take care ladies.",
