The left mastectomy is elective. I still go back and forth on my decision to remove \"the healthy breast\" but also fear if I don't, I might regret it later. My core biopsy showed invasive ductal and the MRI is measuring 2.7cm. They will do sentinel node biopsy the day of surgery. Wishing all the March surgeries a speedy recovery. Tracey",

They ordered the oncotype yesterday and I will be seeing oncology when that comes back. My breast surgeon said she doubts I will need chemo. She said I made the right choice having the mastectomy because of the size. She also said they stage based on the invasive component and since it is less than 2cm and negative nodes, I am at stage 1. Does the total tumor load ever factor in on chemo? Guess I am a little confused on this part of the report??",
