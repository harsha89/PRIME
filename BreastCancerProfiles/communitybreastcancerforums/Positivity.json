I felt alone until I found the forum. I don't like talking to my husband about it because I don't like to worry him. I will definitely be aggressive about it. A part of me wants to just hear \"we saw nothing and all is well\" and just walk away, but the fact is that this dimple which wasn't there before is there and when I lift my arms over my head it does retract (I can't believe I'm even writing this - I'm so scared); and so I need to be aggressive as you all say I need to be with it and not take no for an answer. I guess these are times when they say you need a 2nd, 3rd, and even a 4th opinion. Thanks again ladies...my prayers are also with you and your loved ones!",

I have an appointment with my GP next Teusday and will be asking for the referral. I need to clear all my basis. I am trying to be happy with the results I got but seems deep down inside anxiety is still there, since the symptoms are there. The indenting seems to be extending to the areola. So I am not giving up my quest to be 100% positive all is well.  ",

Last night I was staring at the site in the mirror and noticed that the dimpling has extended more towards the areola region. This can not be good. I thought it was just me so asked my husband to look, and he says he also sees it. I can not wait until these results are in now. I wish they would do a skin patch biopsy NOW, along with an MRI. I am really trying to stay positive and not let the demons in my head take the best of me, but it is so hard this time...Its like my head is speaking to me in a language I don't even understand. ",

I work in a chronic pain clinic so the doctor I work with ordered the tests when I experessed concerns and he checked my R breast. When I get the results I will be here, and will probably read the report myself too. The doctor here says he will call in on Friday to see if they can tell him the results over the phone. Either way I will ask for further testing i.e. biopsy and MRI. I have become such a basket case - I am normally very upbeat and energetic and so it shows all over my face and body language when worried like this and consumed in thought. As I mentioned before I am hiding this from my family so have avoided going to see them, which makes me feel even more vulnrable.  I am also wondering of alternative medicine treatments - there's a lot on the internet that can overwhelm a person in my position, any thoughts of complimentary or alternative meds or treatments?",

I am still waiting to hear the results of the mammogram. I have however decided, thanks to all of your input and advice, that regardless of the mammogram and ultrasound results I will go to see a breast cancer specialist in one of our local hospitals. I will be getting that referral sometime next week. The thing is there is indentation, and I really need to know why, and what it is exactly. ",

I think a breast MRI is a good idea, this is now two people suggesting it and sharing with me that's how they got their answers. I am going to request that. For the most part, I have been healthy all my life. I've had two fractured wrists, and a fractured knee. I have osteopenia (though they thought I'd be two young for that too), but not much else. I live in Canada and because of our health system things are extra slow here, but I work as part of a medical team and will ask for things to be done urgently. I think for me the waiting and not knowing is just horrible. ",
