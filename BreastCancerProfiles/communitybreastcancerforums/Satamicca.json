My youngest child is 5 and i have only ever been able to breastfeed my 3 boys for a max of 2 weeks and then i wake up one day and there is no milk at all. Like its completely gone. Anyway i have had that feeling atleast twice a week for a while now. Then around november i had an operation to have my endometrial walls burnt out (i am going for a total hysterectomy around may/june for other issues i wont go into detail.) Anyway january 2nd, my gallbladder started to fail (another surgery coming up) and thats when i noticed the indentation under my right breast along with dropping 2 cup sizes. I was a dd and now im a c :( i though it was because i had lost alittle weight ( 7ish kg) and didnt think much about it but when i mentioned it to my doctor today he asked about the sensation and then went on to ask to do an examination ( i have a good doc). He said he couldnt feel any lumps but he could defiantly see the indent and its about the width of my little finger and almost as long but its not straight its kinda wonky but about 2 finger widths under my nipple. Ge asked about BC history in my family and from what i know on my mothers side her mother and her mothers sisters all had it along with their girls too (my mother hasnt) so its pretty there in my family and they have all been under 50 when diagnosed. Ok so recap because i know its been a long post but i have a let-down sensation in my right breast on and off, indentation and dropped 2 cup sizes( both breasts have lost their omph). My doc has requested a mammogram and if needed an ultrasound to be done monday but im really stressing. Especially with everything im going through i dont know if i can handle another thing ontop of what im dealing with now. Please please give me some advice even if its bad i cant help but to think about it! Log in to post a reply",

I was wondering how many people have the size reduction, indentation and let down feeling and what were the results? I know im looking at worst case BC but if there is anything else it could be then im open. Everytime i type thoes 3 thinks in all i get is BC. I have felt for a long time now that i was ill but not in the way of a cold or flu sick. I just couldnt put my finger on it and when my gallbladder went, my mom was like \"well this explains it\" but i couldnt help the voice in my head saying \"no i dont think so\" like it was confused. Same thing when the doctors told me about having to have a hysterectomy, again the voice said \" no i dont think so\". I was thinking about it all last night and talking to my partner about it and he tried to joke about how long its been since he got to have a play with the twins and its been about 6 mths since i have let him touch them. It kind of shocked me, and everytime i look in the mirror now (especially after noticing i have dropped from a dd to a c) i cant help to feel grief and loss. I feel so stupid for haveing these feelings. I feel like im over reacting. But i feel i know my body and i feel its telling me something is really wrong and i have felt like that since before all of this around november i just cant put my finger on it. Please if you read this and can identify with the same things eg: loss in breast size, indentation, the \"let down\" feeling, let me know your experience because i would love to know what else it could be. Even if as all my searches have suggested it to be, its BC i would like to try and be mentally prepared.",

I guess im just really scared and im an impatient person at the best of times. I would not wish the fear let alone what you brave women are going threw on my worst enemy. I know i have to wait and thats the hard part but i will definitely keep the post up to date even if it turns out to be all ok (believe me thats all i want) thank you again :)",
