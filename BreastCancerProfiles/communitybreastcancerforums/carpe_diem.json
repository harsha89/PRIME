There are lots of decent substitutes for dairy.  I used to eat a lot of cheese and I still miss it, but I don't miss the 80 pounds.  I use organic when it tastes better, like tomatoes, and mostly eat organic or wild poultry and fish (and not much of that) but I don't feel deprived, and I do feel much healthier.

Arimidex belongs to a class of drugs called aromatase inhibitors, which limit the amount of estrogen the body produces in postmenopausal women. Arimidex works by preventing the conversion of steroids made by the adrenal gland into estrogen.  In a woman who has gone through menopause, the adrenal gland is the largest source of estrogen. Arimidex doesn't work in women who are premenopausal because their ovaries make most of their estrogen.  Tamoxifen belongs to a class of drugs called selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), which work by blocking estrogen from binding to its receptors in the breast. This drug works as well in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women, but the AIs (aromatase inhibitors like arimidex and femara) seem to be more effective, but can lead to reduced bone density.  For post-menopausal metastatic women, taking arimidex first and then switching to tamoxiphen resulted in longer survival than starting with tamoxifen and then switching to arimidex. I've been on arimidex for 27 months, since being diagnosed with lung mets, and the mets were greatly reduced until my last PET/CT.  That showed increased activity in a new area, but I have no symptoms and my tumor markers are stable at about 38 for CA 27-29.  My mo is considering a switch to faslodex, which targets and degrades the estrogen receptors present in breast cancer cells, but we're waiting (nervously on my part) for another PET/CT in August, in the hopes that the last one was just showing lingering effects of radiation, which I finished in March.",

Even though they showed increased uptake, it was still considered possible that they were not related to the bc, since no cancer cells had been found when they drained the pleural effusions. The deciding factor was a lung biopsy that showed cancer cells like the ones found in my breast biopsy. If you don't have any shortness of breath and there's no fluid around the lungs on your scans, they will probably just watch and wait. If you do develop symptoms, a PET/CT would give more info, but only a lung biopsy would be definitive. It's stressful to just monitor them, but lung biopsies are a lot harder than breast and you'll want to wait until it's really necessary. I hope you can find a good pulmonologist. Maybe your mo has a recommendation.",

Don't ask me why he could perform the biopsy now that was impossible a few months earlier. My point is that all the tests I'd had previously were read as normal and it wasn't until I had the PET/CT that cancer of any kind in the lungs was diagnosed.  It may be true that once you have the diagnosis of metastasis, CT scans can be used to follow them, but in my case there was a clear value in the PET/CT for diagnosing them in the first place.  ",

Risk Prediction Model Could Guide Metastatic Breast Cancer Decisions News | February 04, 2016 | Breast Cancer By Dave Levitan A novel prediction model can help predict long-term overall survival among breast cancer patients with distant metastases, according to a new study. The model could be used as a decision-making tool for physicians and patients. \"A reliable prediction of the expected survival in breast cancer patients with distant metastasis is a critical basis for appropriate treatment selection,\" wrote study authors led by Hyeong-Gon Moon, MD, PhD, of Seoul National University College of Medicine in South Korea. \"However, accurate prediction of survival in a newly diagnosed metastatic breast cancer patient is one of the most difficult challenges that physicians face.\" To develop a method to address that challenge, the researchers analyzed data from 547 patients at a single institution; a validation cohort of 254 additional patients from four Korean teaching hospitals was also included. The results were published online ahead of print in Annals of Oncology. Based on the initial cohort, a post-metastasis overall survival (PMOS) score was developed that ranged from 0 to 8. It included six factors with varying weight: primary tumor stage, hormone receptor (HR) status, and Ki-67 expression level; and metastasis-specific factors including the duration of disease-free interval, the site of the metastasis, and the presence of symptoms related to the metastatic site. The median duration of the PMOS in the full cohort was 31 months, and each of those factors was an independent prognostic factor for PMOS. (Tumor stage and PMOS were only significantly associated in those with early relapses.) The patients were divided into four PMOS score groups; some of the higher risk characteristics that raised a patient's score included brain or multiple metastatic sites, high Ki-67 expression, and HR positivity. \"The PMOS score in patients with distant metastasis clearly separated groups of different survival outcomes (P < .0001),\" the authors wrote. The patients in the group with the lowest PMOS score (0 or 1) had a median survival of 71 months, compared with only 12 months for those in the group with the highest scores (6 to 8). The score \"successfully predicted the post-metastasis survival\" in the validation cohort as well, with the two highest groups showing significantly poorer survival than the lowest (P < .0001). Those patients with higher scores, the authors wrote, \"are unlikely to benefit from intensive multidisciplinary therapy aimed at clinical remission since their disease may progress rapidly.\"  PS I'm only glad that I immediately changed from the onc who seemed to agree that I was \"unlikely to benefit from intensive multidisciplinary therapy aimed at clinical remission since their disease may progress rapidly\" and switched to a doctor who felt I was worth treating and eventually having a mastectomy. I now have lung, bone, and liver mets, but I feel pretty well except for side effects and I'm nowhere near ready to throw in the towel. Here's to five more years!",

(Testing of the fluid withdrawn from the lung had been negative for cancer cells, and everthing else they looked for.) Even after the lung nodules lit up in the PET scan, they still weren't sure it wasn't infection until the biopsy showed the same cancer as the breast biopsy.  The confusion about IIIc vs IV is probably because IIIc was added fairly recently and Supraclavicular spread used to be considered stage IV: Brito  from The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, observed significantly better survival after multimodality treatment among 70 patients with solitary ipsilateral supraclavicular metastases at first presentation compared with patients with nonsupraclavicular metastatic disease. Due to concerns regarding undertreatment, Brito et al. advocated the inclusion of supraclavicular disease in the Stage III (rather than Stage IV) category. This recommendation was followed by the International Union Against Cancer in the most recent edition of the TNM Classification of Malignant Tumors; patients with metastases in supraclavicular lymph nodes now are classified as N3c/pN3c, and a new stage (Stage IIIC) that includes N3 (pN3a, pN3b, pN3c) M0 (any T-classification) has been introduced. In previous editions, these malignancies had been classified as distant metastases (M1; Stage IV disease). From van der Sangen MJ, Coebergh JW, Roumen RM, Rutten HJ, Vreugdenhil G, Voogd AC.    Cancer. 2003 Jul 1;98(1):11-7. Department of Radiotherapy, Catharina Hospital, Eindhoven, The Netherlands. So the current trend is to call it IIIc and treat it more aggressively in hopes of curing or greatly extending survival, rather than IV which has generally been treated with palliative care.  Even that is changing as better systemic treatments become available.  After being told since diagnosis that \"the horse was out of the barn\" and mx was useless, my doctor's now talking about improved survival with mx for patients with limited metastases. I've gone (mostly) vegan and I exercise a lot more.  It won't cure advanced breast cancer, but I feel great and I hope it will give my treatment the best chance of working.  Take a deep breath and look around for people and activities that help you feel your best.  It does sound as if your onc may be a bit out of date; maybe you should look for a second opinion. This must all be pretty frightening, but I know that listening to all the long-term advanced cancer survivors around here keeps my hopes up. Janet ",

I'm not religious and when friends tell me they are praying for me, I generally suggest that they might instead spend their time helping someone out.  I attend a Unitarian Universalist church, mostly because I like to sing, but I do agree with their tenets, especially, \"Service is our prayer.\"  When my best friend was dying of breast cancer she was a much-loved accompanist and music librarian at a Suzuki School/Youth Orchestra.  There were a number of fundamentalist Christian mothers there who made every effort to convince Sharon (also a UU) that if she just accepted Jesus as her Savior and had true faith, she would be cured.  I found it pretty offensive. Even at my current, fairly humanist, church, I am frequently told that I'm doing well because I have a positive attitude.  Frankly, I think I have a positive attitude because I'm doing well.  My first onc was the terminal, palliative, hand-patting type and I switched pretty fast because of what I considered his negative attitude, but my current MO didn't really suggest miracles were likely.  However, as I continued to do well she did go so far as to suggest I could be in the group of stage IV patients for whom bc is a chronic disease, and I have recently been treated much more aggressively.  I'm just hoping for a few years with good QOL, and then I'll hope for a few more, but no chasing miracles.

But about 25 percent of those with early-stage disease develop metastatic forms, with an estimated 49,000 new diagnoses each year, according to the American Cancer Society. If I understand the statistics, of 100 diagnoses, 5 patients are already stage IV but an additional 25 will eventually become stage IV.  So the initial diagnosis is fairly uncommon, but of all stage IV patients 5/(5+25) = 5/30 = 1/6, or close to 17% were diagnosed initially.  So among our group, you would expect it to be fairly common.

I have also always struggled with my weight and had never gotten below 200 after my second son was born in 1981.  I gained and lost the same 50 lbs., mostly on low carb diets which worked fine until my stomach was too upset to continue.  Then I'd gain it all back over the next year or two with a few more for company.  I had endometrial cancer in 2006, bladder cancer in 2007 and 2010 along with gall bladder surgery between the bladder cancer dx and surgery, but all I did was continue the yoyo, topping out at 287.  Then in 2010 I had a breast \"blob\" I was assured (mammogram and ultrasound) was not cancer, two pleural effusions that I was assured were not cancer.  I continued to have shortness of breath and decided it was finally time to try something new, so I started a walking program with my husband and a semi-vegetarian diet - vegetarian meals every other day, and reduced portions.  I lost 25 lbs between August and November and then managed to stabilize for the holidays. By then it was clear that something was seriously wrong with my left breast (inverted nipple, weird shape) and an additional mammogram showed cancer.  It was no surprise that the PET/CT showed activity in the left lung and a biopsy showed the breast cancer had metastasized there. Now I got involved in an exercise and nutrition program at my cancer center in addition to the walking and followed up on a friend's recommendation to check out the Plant Programme, Jane Plant's response to her own breast cancer.  I'm sure there are other good diets out there, but what they all seem to have in common is a plant based regimin with no red meat or processed foods, limited organic poultry and fish, and lots of fruits and vegetables.  My diet totally eliminates dairy, pretty hard for a cheese lover, but some allow low-fat cheese.  For me, it was easier to just avoid it entirely since I love it so much I'd find it hard to stop. Since May 8, 2010 I have lost an additional 80 lbs.  I've again been slowed down by Thanksgiving and surgery (my doctors finally decided that a mx might be useful), but I'm ready to hop back on the bandwagon, hoping to lose about a pound a week with diet and exercise.  Six days after surgery I'm already having to remind myself to take it easy - I have very little pain and lots of energy. Everyone is different, and my only medication for cancer has been anastrozole (arimidex).  My side effects have been minimal, but my NP tells me that increasing exercise and improving diet probably helped with that.  So my advice is not to think about diet and rapid weight loss, but to find support for exercise and diet that will change your lifestyle and gradually reduce your weight.

Since then, I've occasionally had trouble getting a PET/CT approved, but your doctor can resubmit it as a \"peer-to-peer\" request where he (or she) talks to a doctor at the insurance company instead of just handling it at a lower level.  This has always worked for me (knock wood ) and is generally faster than just submitting a request for reconsideration, which can take weeks for a reply. Even if the PET/CT shows nothing else, supraclavical lymph node involvement makes it stage IIIc, I think, which gets treated pretty agressively, so it's important to get right on this.  I hope your MO can get the insurance company to see reason.

Some doctors scan regularly, maybe once a year, but the standard treatment is to wait for symptoms and then scan. The theory is that finding mets a little early doesn't affect the outcome and frequent scans expose you to more radiation and may cause cancer. An example was given of a woman who had clear scans and then developed symptoms a few weeks later. Both she and her doctor minimized the problem, since she'd just been given a clean bill of health, and her mets were found later than if they had waited for symptoms and then scanned. On the other hand, a radiologist spoke to the group about treating individual metastases with stereotactic radiation as possibly curative in some cases with one to five mets limited to one organ.  You'd think that would need to be found early, so go figure. I had mets right away and had symptoms (shortness of breath, pleural effusion) months before I was finally diagnosed with bc, but if I hadn't I'd have wanted to be followed at least with regular blood work and maybe tumor markers that might pick up a problem early. ",

I have lots of little nodules and a loculated pleural effusion that surrounds the lower left lobe, but I've heard of lung surgery for isolated tumors. Even with the odd flapping, do you feel you've had any positive results from the surgery?",

The fluid showed no signs of any disease, but the biopsy showed bc mets.  That was almost three years ago, and I'm still stable on arimidex.  Since you're ER+, there's a good chance you'll respond well to AI's, possibly after treatment to stop your ovaries.  I've gone past hoping - now I'm planning to stick around for a good many years.  There are lots of treatments available, and more are found every year.

It gives the radiation dose for common procedures measured in mSv (millisieverts), ranging from 0.001 mSv for a DEXA bone density up to 14.1 mSv for a whole body PET scan. These can add up pretty quickly: if you have a chest CT, that's 7 mSv, but if you have a CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis you're up to 21 mSv. A bone scan is pretty close to a chest CT, at 6.3 mSv, while a chest x-ray is only 0.1 mSv and a mammogram is 0.4 mSv. I also found this: In a 2009 study from Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, researchers estimated the potential risk of cancer from CT scans in 31,462 patients over 22 years. For the group as a whole, the increase in risk was slight \u2014 0.7% above the overall lifetime risk of cancer in the United States, which is 42%. But for patients who had multiple CT scans, the increase in risk was higher, ranging from 2.7% to 12%. (In this group, 33% had received more than five CT scans; 5%, more than 22 scans; and 1%, more than 38.) I would say that the younger you are, the more you would like to avoid the high dose scans if some other test will give the information you want.  Ultrasound and MRI's use no radiation. ",

Generally you need 40 credits, 20 of which were earned in the last 10 years ending with the year you become disabled. However, younger workers may qualify with fewer credits.

I had heard about the terrible event, but was surprised to get a call at the local Youth Orchestra, where I worked, to say that she had left us a grand piano in her will, but requested that the Youth Orchestra provide a string quartet to play at her funeral. This was on a school day, and in Texas it's hard to get high school students released, so we went with a middle school group of talented 12 and 13-year-olds.  Most of the repertoire was left up to us, but she particularly asked for \"Send in the Clowns.\" Fortunately, the violist also played piano, so he quickly worked up the piece and they played to a large appreciative audience. Then we trucked the piano off to Orchestra Hall.  I'd been thinking about the second movement of the Bach A Minor violin concerto, and maybe Brahms' \"How Lovely is Thy Dwelling Place\" for my funeral, but I really ought to add, \"Send in the Clowns\" to the list.  Not that I'm planning to check out anytime soon.

My bad news radar went off at that point, but turns out she had realized that I was there after scans (which she hadn't seen yet) and wanted to see me herself. And nothing was reported in the left shoulder area.

Like I said, \"Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.\" I used to support Komen and Planned Parenthood, but now my donations go to Planned Parenthood, American Cancer Society, and American Institute for Cancer Research.  I think it's money well spent.",
