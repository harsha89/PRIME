I'm pretty boring - work, walking (when I'm up to it..my head MO says I need to do an hour a day to endure the next chemo - Carboplatin 6x), trying to keep the garden up, get bloodwork done and oh, it's time for chemo again. I haven't put a 40 hour work week in yet, but I might get close this week for the first time since chemo commenced.  btw, I often go to the Australian Sisters threads as my friend AussieKate is there and I always enjoy reading your good advice. NancyH - You've actually continued your work/study life fulltime throughout?  You are impressive! Yes, even in normal times there are those once in a while circumtances.  I'd say you are experiencing one.  I hope your son gets better quickly.   I could not have done what you have done.  As a federal employee, I am using my generous sick/annual leave as needed.  Even if I run out (which I'm trying not to do), we have a donor leave program. I try to listen to my body as first priority, but I know I also have that luxury of taking a day off (with pay) and am so appreciative of my benefits.  Thank you on the information on the numbness.  Seems like we are following the same pattern, including high oncotype score.  I've always been curious about your 6x DD on Taxol.  Is that a standard protocol or part of the clinical trial?  I'm going to have Carboplatin after the Taxol as non-standard protocol, as it seems be beneficial for BRCA cancers. Chemo til the end of July. Congrats to all that have finished Taxol (or any chemo) or are about to!  I so look forward to the day I finish chemo, though I'm perfectly aware \"finishing chemo\" may bring on a whole new set of issues.  I often wonder what it will be like to not be focusing on the next milestone of BC, i.e. ordinary life, once again. ",

Personally, I'm finding Taxol much harder than AC due to the pain (I've learned to manage, somewhat, with hydrocodone.)  Now my right hand is going numb. I wouldn't call it neuropathy as I've had that, slightly, in my feet, pre-chemo, but numbness that I can't shake out.  Will this go away?? Can anybody comment on the timing - i.e. for me it started up shortly after Taxol #2.  Will it go away as I approach Taxol #3?? Ofcourse I realize we are different, but looking for your personal experiences. Thank you ",

I called Geonomics to ask more detailed questions, especially about some of their \"averages\" for the high category and the young woman on the other end of the line said she couldn't give me more info because \"they weren't licensed to do so.\"  I'll give her that she meant to say \"it is proprietary information;\" she was very young.  I get it, the MO will just look at the final RS and Rx Chemo or not, but it seems that knowing a bit more about one's cell biology, which box they failed or exceeded in, might elucidate something.  Personally, I am left with not knowing if my initial path or the Oncotype score for ER were out of wack, or that my 39 score resulted from a high proliferation rate (which I only know as a possibility from such a high Ki67 by my initial path - 60%).  Too little info given for the amount of money paid. In a sense, I am lucky in that most of my first path values indicated the possibility of a High Oncotype score, but I feel very bad for those who appear to be high grade, high Ki67 on initial path, but end up with a low Oncotype score.  I've seen a couple here in BCO.  I'd want to know why the two reports were out of synch before I forwent chemo.",

When I've asked my MO about my mediocre ER status, though still positive, they all say \"it doesn't matter.\"  I always got the sense it was like being pregnant or not.   Then again Oncoscoring does give is more points the higher the score is (actually less, as it substracts from the final total oncotype score), maybe they're not giving me the correct picture? btw, my Oncoscore for ER was 9.0...mediocre, but my initial path said 90%.  I've always interpreted this as 90% of the sampled cells have estrogen receptors, but their reactivity was a 9.0...which is sort of middling on Myriad's scale.  Am I wrong about this? ",

Bertrand, or the type of cancer.  Both genes! Did a little more research...per this article: http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2013/may/27/jolies-aunt-dies-of-breast-cancer-in-escondido/ The 37-year-old Jolie said in her op-ed that, because she carries both defective genes, her doctors estimated that she had a 50 percent risk of getting ovarian cancer but an 87 percent risk of breast cancer. I have read it is possible for a fetus to survive being brca1-brca2 and maybe brca2-brca2 (with issues such as Fanconi anemia), but definitely not brca1-brca1, but the fact that AJ has both explains why she was given the \"special statistics.\"  As brca2 though, she also has risk for additional cancers, over and above ovarian and breast. I guess I missed this in the original op-ed.  Unless Jon Voight gave her the brca2 mutation, AJ's mother had to have carred both the brca1 and brca2 mutation also.",

My own personal experience, just inquiring about the brca test when it first came out, was dismal, so I am very pleased to see someone like AJ come out about the testing and her decision. Myriad's stock rose 4% today on the news.  I suppose that presumes more women will get the testing done, but in my case, if it wasn't for a doctor telling me \"what would you do different if you find out you are brca+\" or \"you'll have to go to a big city to get tested and it's expensive,\" or having an insurance company that only pays for the test \"if one already has cancer,\" I might not be where I am today, worrying about my cancer coming back. So perhaps AJ's coming out will enlighten both potential brca carriers and their physicans that both getting the test (including the hows and whys) and doing a PBMX is not some horrible thing or arcane thing to do.  I honestly can't think of a better \"role model,\" given how breasts are tied up with our femininity and who is revered more than AJ, in that department?  Maybe insurance companies will loosen their restrictions on who can be reimbursed. Atleast for most brca carriers, we have seen someone in our family (in my case my mother and 2 aunts) die of breast cancer.  We sort of know what a means, though I don't think anything supplants personal experience.  Nevertheless, the \"what would you do different\" response is uncalled for.  (For one - how about an ooph?)  To those of us who think we are crazy for doing a PBMX (without cancer), I've found they don't have the ability to understand, so it is not worth engaging these folks. To FarmerLucy's question: Oh - and I think I heard mention that AJ had some type of nipple procedure a few weeks before the mx. Does anyone know about that? I have the same exact question!! I was told, unless an A or B cup, you don't qualify for a NSPBMX. My own process began on Feb. 2 with a procedure known as a \u201cnipple delay,\u201d which rules out disease in the breast ducts behind the nipple and draws extra blood flow to the area. This causes some pain and a lot of bruising, but it increases the chance of saving the nipple. She was treated at the Pink Lotus Breast Center in Beverly Hills.  Is this procedure something only the rich can afford? I also have a question about this and anyone who knows the answer, please chime in: My doctors estimated that I had an 87 percent risk of breast cancer and a 50 percent risk of ovarian cancer, although the risk is different in the case of each woman. Only a fraction of breast cancers result from an inherited gene mutation. Those with a defect in BRCA1 have a 65 percent risk of getting it, on average. AJ seems to imply that her particular version of her brca1 mutation has a higher risk of BC than the average for brca1.  Am I reading this wrong.  I never got a set of separate statistic for my 866delGT?? Did she pay for more information from Myriad than my $4000 bought me?",

Two other things still baffle me.. 1)  The \"Her2/Neu (equivocal +2/negative)\" ...does that mean negative??.  There was talk of my path not being finished by my gynecologist Friday at 1000, but when I called the Lab in the afternoon, they said everything was done.  When talking to the intake person at OHSU, she seemed to say/think it was negative, but I wonder if all of that means it is still getting further testing?  2) The Ultrasound report mentioned something about an Axillary Tail...I don't have the report in front of me, but when I mentioned that to the Radiologist during biopsy (and me not realizing the significance of it), she seemed alarmed at first.  For the life of me, I cannot remember if she looked back at my report than just decided it was AOK, or she just took my word for what it said.  Would they mention an Axillary Tail in a US report if it wasn't involved with the lesion?? Any advice will be much appreciated. Needless to say, I don't need to ponder things that aren't worth pondering at this point!! Log in to post a reply",

The US of my gall bladder yielded nothing, but that was about 2 years ago. I also eat the same amount of fat now, or more, than I did with eggs, though I can tolerate a couple of eggs here and there, definitely not a steady diet.

On December 23, 2016, I fell hard on my left trochanter bone (hip). Before that, I had had right hip pain when I walked for over an hour, since late summer 2016. Just a dull pain. Because of the hard fall, I had X-rays of my hips (he wanted to compare the right and left, but the left was the one I fell on). Nothing was remarkable (nothing broken, but maybe some bone spurs). Since the fall, my right hip \"pain\" (still just a dull ache) has gotten a bit worse. Now, when sleeping, I can only stand about 10 minutes on my right side (I'm a side sleeper) and I get some associate pain in my thigh and right shin (like sciatica, but not down the back of the leg). My question is, would that X-ray have shown any bone cancer lesions (taken early January)? Do bone mets cause constant pain, dull ache, only under pressure??? What should I do next? I feel my hip now, but it's just like it is there.",

More startling, when I asked a local surgeon (who treated BC patients surgically) about the test, albeit years ago, his response was \"what would you do differently if you knew you were positive?\"....uh, hum....now it's quite obvious - \"remove my ovaries!\"  He even admitted to me recently it's not an area of medicine he keeps up on. I told my ob/gyn, if even one of her patients has a concern with BRCA, she should have a geneticist's name at hand and offer to make her an appointment.  Let the geneticist inform the patient if it's worth testing or not.  Even after my counseling appt., my chance was 7% (w/o knowledge of my cousin), but I would have never regretted having the test done, even if it came out negative and I had to pay for it myself!",

Got clear margins, no node involvement. Oncoscore came back as 39. Sorry, no numbers in front of me, but ER came back as still positive, but more middling than what 90% IHC looked like.

BUT, just after writing above post, one of my remaining two drains just put out over 100ml in last 11.5 hours. I've been getting readings that would allow their removal (3-10 in 12 hours), just waiting for a consistent 48 hour period, then i was going to go to a local NP and have them removed. This is larger than anything I've ever measured. The bulb was fully extended and I wondered if I had forgotten to expel the air after emptying the last time, but that would seem to me to create less suction, not more.

What if after the pathology on the \"clean breast\" cancer showed up? I know the cancerous nodes \"feel different,\" but likely one would have more nodes removed than with SNB in any followup.  Have they done a US of your right axillary area?  I understand an US comes up with 20% false negatives, but it catches cancer in the nodes (not micromets) 80% of the time.  Did a mammo not detect your first cancer?  Mine lit up on a mammo, so I felt pretty confident that my right breast was clean, as it was.",

My MO gave me a pep talk....\"it wasn't in my nodes and that one is a really important factor\" but after discussing my Oncotype score, she increased my recurrence score from 12 to 18% (with chemo), so now I'm confused why I'm getting these two different numbers from two different MO's.  And, afterall, Oncotype assumes no node involvement, so it's not like that is making a difference to those numbers.  Must be the steroids, I'm still feeling much better. Hope all are getting better too! ",

Had one rough spot today when BS was asking me about feeling comfortable with my choice of BMX, as if I shouldn't be, and when I questioned her on that she said \"this wasn't my recommendation.\" Ugh, so I questioned myself at this 11th hour and wondered if with BRCA should I have taken the chance of a lumpectomy, breast reduction and lift --believe me, the prospect of that surgery was more delightful than what is happening tomorrow--but hope and pray I don't get a second primary, not just dealing with CA again, but having had Rads once in the left side already if I went the LUMP route ( I'm avoiding rads now). Anyway, it's totally thrown me for a loop. Ofcourse she had to remind me I'm not eliminating BC altogether with a BMX, but I reminded myself I'm lowering my chances below the \"1 in 8 women will get BC\" with a BMX. On a lighter note, this PS has no problem with showering after surgery- yeah! Turns out Alloderm is only used based on the coverage provided by the pectoralis muscle and where it attaches midline.",

(7 hour drive)   I guess I better figure out what a MUGA is Moonflower..   I find I can't handle all the things one needs to be prepared for more than one new event at a time.  My suspician is that I will have a high Oncotype score, based on various things, so I do see Chemo in my future.  Maybe that is being a pessimist, but so far I've been right on every instinct I've had thus far, except BRCA positive.  It's one way of being psychologically prepared, I suppose. Thank you all for such helpful advice. ",

In my chemo group (2012 thread), there were only 2 out of 30 or so that had my symptoms. I have permanent neuropathy in my feet.

I know there are people with worse neuropathy, but I live in the beautiful forest and would like to go on day long hikes. No way. On soft dirt trails, I can last about an hour without noticing my feet. At 2 hours they are burning up. At 2.5 hours I would be wondering if I could make it back to my car. I did get some improvement in year 3 with Vit B spray (was taking it for other reasons). Standing on a hard surface causes burning. It's all about cumulative psi's.

When I looked at the 4 (or 5?) pages of options for my friend here in California, I think 4 per page, so 16 - 20 total, only 2 were really reasonable, most meant for other geographical areas.  The other plan that she did not choose would have been $25 a month for her (her income is around $16k/year), but it was unclear whether the doctors she needed were part of it so she went for the $45 a month plan.  Good plan to for her income - $5 copays, $0 deductibles.  If you live in a state where the Enhanced Medicaid is not available - you may be experiencing the problems you are having, but I can't tell from what you are saying.  If nothing else, I would locate a Navigator or try the telephone service to see if you can qualify for something more affordable. I'm confused as you said you had no insurance in post above, then you say your insurance (what insurance?? ) would be $500 a month and now it is saying $900 a month.   For $500 a month from a private plan, you might end up paying thousands anyway because of deductibles, copays, %'s, catastrophic amounts, so the $400 difference maybe be cheaper, especially if you have BC.",

Unfortuneately, GA opted out of those federal funds (I just looked) when the SCOTUS ruling allowed that, state by state.  Enhanced Medicaid qualified a single person making up to $15856 (AGI) and a family of 3 to make $26951 (AGI - income after taking out exemptions and deductions, like mortgage interest - assets don't count).  The problem with places like GA, they left out a whole group of people who make less than these amounts, but too much for regular Medicaid - crazy. A little hint.  My girlfriend made less than $15, 856 and even though in California we do have Enhanced Medicaid (she would have qualified for this), she made sure her income would be $15,856 (she will sell some bonds for capital gains, etc., work more, if possible), so she could get regular insurance rather than Medicaid.  She has a stigma about being on Medicaid** despite the fact that she will be subsidized for the most part by the ACA plan she has chosen (as I said, she is paying $45 per month).   She desperately needs a hip replacement, so it is a double-edged sword for her.  She'll need to work more, but until she gets the operation, she is cleaning houses on her hands and knees, sometimes. ** It is not clear, from what I've read and heard, that a doctor will be reimbursed differently between Medicaid and the ACA.  I know the Doctor's networks reflect no difference and in some cases, the networks for Medicaid are greater (per Doctor's Radio out of  NYU). If, as you say, you aren't too far above the Medicaid limits, and if you do or can make the $26951 (example for family of 3), then you should be able to get a very reasonable plan based on California's pool costs.  I don't know what to say if you fall in that Georgia donut hole - that is bad.",

I just tried the tool now that I'm off the Iphone.   The spreadsheet model predicted an Oncotype score of 30, my actual is 39.   Ok, a little confused why Her2 included in the SS as the Genomic's cohort doesn't include Her2+.  I know some Her2's get the test because they are thought to be Her2- at the time test ordered and they do end up getting high scores, but is there any relevancy between the score and recurrence for these women? Also, something pesky with being low PR - worse than being low ER.  Probably the correlation with being luminal B.",

There was a discussion elsewhere on BCO, a year ago or so, where people discussed their own personal experiences with IHC versus Oncotype and I remember coming out of it more confused than ever as it appeared to correlate as much as it appeared not to.  Is this a measurement error or is it the nature of the tests?  The tests are definitely different (what and how) and perhaps what my MO was expressing was that nature of the test is more predictive rather than one testing process being more accurate, or even precise, than the other. ",

I might add, I discovered this one day by chance. One day I found myself in tears and crying.  My pound cat was out and about chasing something and as soon as she noticed me crying she stopped dead in her tracks and ran to me.  She then proceeded to comfort me by nudging and walking all over my lap.  I've tested this over and over (yes, I shouldn't be abusing this), but if I whimper, she always comes and does the same behavior.  She was a mother while in the pound, so maybe it reminds her of the sound of kittens? Honestly, I think cats can be just what the doctor ordered for us BC patients.  I feel totaly nurtured by and nurturing toward my cats. Linda - those are beautiful cats!!  Mine are two tuxedos (short and medium length)...someone told me that tuxedos don't shed..whether that is true or not, I've found it to be true.  After having a Siamese, I've noticed a huge difference....no cat hair at my place!",

Additionally, my MO is giving it to all of her patients that are node positive too just to give her a better understanding of the aggressiveness of the tumor.   And since even a grade 1 can get a high score, she probably gives it to all her node negative ER+ patients too - but that kind of goes without saying.",

As far as the daVinci robotic machine and or plain vanilla laproscopy, my surgery was going to go either way depending on how much room the PS needed to maneuver around the da Vinci for the exchange.  Turned out I got the plain vanilla laproscopy.  According to my friend, a surgeon, and my surgeon, it makes no difference to either whether they use the DaVinci or not - there is no advantage to them.

Cookie monster - you were the one that started our group and I don't think I've seen you here for a long time. So glad to hear you are doing well! I think I struggle with whether to drop the blocker or not just because it is powerful stuff. I never struggled like some, but I can't say my hands don't feel it or the slight hair loss on top. I'm curious if any of you that did quit, did you have hair loss and did it come back after quitting? My MO thinks it will, but I also wonder if she's not just trying to give me hope LOL. So nice to hear from you all. I hope I didn't miss anyone? Quinncat (kam170) ",

Scar tissue from the radiation?  From my research (though my PS failed to tell me this during the consult), they do a breast reduction partly because radiation is difficult with large breasts.  I guess most women who are large are so exciting about the \"free\" breast reduction they don't ask why and maybe the PS didn't bother explaining for that reason. Do you think that might have been the cause of your radiation issues?",

So having no idea what you have, but experiencing this muscoskeletal pain, I will add this.  There is the acute phase when you are in extreme pain, then there is the chronic phase when you have good times and bad times and need to be preemptive.  When I'm in the acute phase, I just manage the pain by taking Celebrex and try to let it get better.  Massage of the neck gave me much relief.  When I was feeling better, paying UBER attention to my ergonomics at my desk prevented it's recurrence or atleast getting worse..  The PT can help with that.  What I did wrong when I first felt the shoulder pain coming on, I did not get on to Celebrex or get PT.  I think I could have prevented the really bad phase I went through. I\"m not a pill taker.  I always forgoe rather than partake (cancer cured that).  Anyway, I view Celebrex as a wonder drug. There can be serious SE's, though I haven't had any, but they literally cured my neck shoulder thing.  There are also many journal articles of Celebrex slowing tumor growth!  It is an anti-inflammatory and as such changes the terrane for the cancer tumor to react to.  Some of this may be helpful, maybe not.  Just my 2 cents. ",

For all of the BRCA2 women here...one?  She said that if BC comes first, then Ovarian cancer usually comes 9 years later on average.  This was in response to me worrying about keeping my ovaries until August. ",

I am fine now....a PT got rid of the cording.  My BS even released me for BP and blood draws on my cancer side after SNB (guess what..differing opinions on that too).",

Why wasn't that offerred to me??

I'm still a little ?? about brca2+ putting you at risk for stomach cancer, though.  I asked the geneticist that one specifically since my grandfather (presumably the brca2+ carrier in my family) died of \"stomach cancer\" in 1925.  The geneticist said it was probably not stomach...not a risk factor for brca.  In his case, maybe pancreatic, if he indeed was the purveyor of the brca.  ",

      "Content": "Jan 11, 2013 01:48AM - edited Jan 11, 2013 01:52AM by QuinnCat Ginger - at first my hands went numb - maybe for 2 nights and always felt only upon waking up, then the finger joints were totally stiff upon waking.  Then the trigger fingers.  I tried wrist splits (ACE brand, I think, from Rite-Aid drug store) and at first it didn't really do any good. I only tried 2 nights.   After going through this stiffness for nearly 2 months (and it was starting to create residual pain during the daytime), I tried the wrist splints again.  Voila!! No stiffness when I woke up the next day.  Wore the wrist splints again - no stiffness upon waking.  I've done this 3 nights and no stiffness.  There still is some residual something in the joints, but it is clearing.  I also took celerex around noon before each of these 3 nights.  One might say the Celebrex is what helped, but yesterday I fell asleep while watching tv and I woke up with stiff finger joints (no splints on).  So it is the lack of movement, for me, while bending the wrist.  I don't think the celebrex played a part, though I'm adding it now to try to get my inflammation down. My stiffness started 3 months after starting Exemestane. I have no doubt in my mind it wa the hormone blocker that caused it. Have you tried wrist splints? Edited to add - I have had these issues before, in 2006, including horrible shoulder issues.  Celebrex (only temporarily and very occasionally if I feel something coming on) and ergonomics eventually cured both (or kept it away).  For one, I sleep with one of those large European pillows and wrap my arm over the top (hugging it).  This helped my shoulders.  Also, using the computer while seated - I had a horrible situation.  Lots of exercises, like tucking chin in relieved the shoulder issues.  Rocking pelvis back and forth.  Lots of stretches. Ofcourse, if things are really bad, you sort of have to nurse things back to a certain state.  Celebrex is one of those black box drugs, but it is also curative for these inflammation issues.",

Sucks, since I am the first in my generation to get BC (turned out there was one in Canada who is sort of anti-medicine and wouldn't even get one now that she has my info). I always felt there was a possibility of being BRCA, but my doctors always said to me \"what would you do different?\"  I reminded one of them, just this week, of this: \"Remove my ovaries!\"  It seems to me, so many doctors are not really up on even the simplest of nuances of what BRCA means.  To me, not knowing your father's history should be grounds enough.  I'm mad about this topic, as I might have been the one that got ovarian cancer and would have had the test if my insurance would have paid, earlier, though I still have my ovaries waiting for this chemo to be done with. Car accident - had to happen. Out of state plates (me) and pulling out of a Starbuck's parking lot. I'm sure that cop stealthly pulled in behind me, and quickly, with his double tall latte, and despite me looking in my rear view mirror (to correct the wrong order given to me at Starbucks), his car was so low compared to my SUV, I backed into him. I pushed up his cruiser bumper and caused $2500 damage on my own car (1 mph). Not sure what my insurance is paying to him.  Still dealing with my own repairs, but took another trip to pdx with dashboard lights coming on and locks not operating with my key.",

Is that what you mean?  So naturally, cancermath.net would be more generous with survival numbers compared to life without a recurrence, which Oncotype reports.  Also, their timeframe is 15 years, while Oncotyping is 10 years, somewhat offsetting the two different measurements. ",

After my SNB, I was off the painkillers the minute I left the recovery room, now I watch the clock to see when I can take the next one--especially when I'm trying to sleep (when I don't take Ambien-which in my whole life til now never used a sleep aid). For days after the surgery, I slept in a chair because 20 degrees from vertical causes pain (left side only). I sleep in my bed all propped up. It is pretty miserable, therefore the sleep aids, though I skip every other night and just doze on and off. It's almost like having a stitch in ones side, and with certain positions or movements the pain comes. Walking is fine, but bending over or lying back sucks. It comes from a spot or spots in and around the breast bone on the left side. Does this sound normal? I have 3 pain pills left and extra-strength Tylenol doesn't cut it. I'm worried there is something catching in there and if I have to have chemo, this could be a rough road waiting for my exchange. And how can I stand to be filled at this point? (The first one scheduled is next week.) I have other symptoms, like lots of swelling under arms or this sense that i have a too tight bra on around my rib cage, but these symptoms somewhat pale by comparison. Help!",

I'm sensing a conflict, but haven't seen my MO for 4 weeks now, so this is based only the PA's response when I ask about the Carboplatin.  Another member here wanted Carboplatin for her BRCA cancer and MDAnderson refused, so I'm preparing for a possible contraversey.  There are no official protocols for platinum therapy for BRCA cancer, but lots of anectdotal evidence that it reacts really well to Platinum therapies.  The only thing I\"m worried about is \"resistence to\" after awhile.

I do think the real solution is reframing my mother's event and somehow disconnecting it from my own personal situation.  Today, on a walk with gf, she told me of how she recently changed her view on something.  She recently lost her father. They were very close and she just couldn't get over her grief and undeserved guilt cause she wasn't there at the moment he unexpectedly and suddenly died (he was in another part of the state and had a heart attack).  She went through one session of \"bilateral brain stimulation\"...something I've known as NLP, or Psychodrama, and she was literally cured of all of those undeserved feelings.  I was encouraged that after one session she was able to transform those feelings about her father's death.  On the other hand I've had over 4 decades to relive my mother's death...it might take more work, but I'm definitely going to try solve this problem.  This is no way to live.",

I was looking at some individual studies that layed the groundwork for the oncotyping and one of the graphs showed that Tamoxifen (as proxy for any of the anti-hormonals) does little for the high risk group (RS >=31).  In fact, recurrence was slightly higher in this group with Tamoxifen!   In the footnotes of the Powerpoint, it said to ignore the results of this particular group, but did little to explain why I should ignore it.  This is in direct opposition to what my ooph surgeon told me, that hormone therapy supplies a much more positive affect on cancer than chemo. Gads, if it's not one piece of bad news, it's another. Not all BC is created equal, it seems. (Sorry for the negativity...sometimes I need to vent.)",

Since your dx is very similar to mine, yesterday my MO asked if I would be interested in a new BC Vaccine clinical trial.  Ofcourse, there is a risk for getting a placebo, but no risk no reward.  She couldn't give me any more information than that except we had to be \"disease free,\" and since she is saying that to a BC patient, I'm thinking it is the one the Mayo Clinic is sponsering where the vaccine is designed to prevent a relapse in early stage dx BC.  My only problem is that I have to drive 85 miles to my MO and if I get the placebo - boo hoo.  Then again, one would probably get free checkups, etc., which in my case would be a huge help.  The ACS gives me $300 a year for gas, as I'm in a rural zipcode, so that helps too.",

I didn't say that very well.  As far as the number of surgeries, it does seem less complicated, if not less serious or even more serious (I do not know).  This is where I'm lacking knowledge, but had a discussion with my MO about when one can say BC is \"cured.\"  Basically never, which makes BC different from some other cancers.  She then told me, for example, if lymphoma doesn't come back in 5 years, it is cured.  If colon cancer doesn't come back in 3 years (don't nail me on that number, the lymphoma is correct though), it is cured.  Based on my discussions with my neighbor who had kidney cancer, it seemed that it could be cured.  So that was where I was coming from...I was mostly happy that it was not BC, as that would seem to be the least desirable outcome.  Please keep us posted. I've thought about you everyday since you posted this devastating news. My SIL was born with one kidney, is now 63 and doing fine.  Is it protocol to try to save the kidney in this case, even if you have a second? ",

The only thing that I can say about the uterus is my MO was questioning why I didn't have my uterus taken out (after the fact, which was a little bit surprising and why didn't she mention it to me before?).  My gyn MO did not want to take it out, and various posters here said the uterus led to some \"support\" of the organs, while other said they noticed no difference after removal, i.e. incontinence.   The MO wanted to try me on Tamoxifen, since I have had SEs with Exemestane,  but I wasn't excited to add uterine cancer to the cancer worry list - don't we have enough? I've been on Exemestane since mid August.  At first I got hot flashes and a bit of insomnia.  The hot flashes have gone away, but since November, I've been dealing with stiff finger joints and trigger fingers.  I think it is from swelling and there is so little tolerance for the tendons.  Last night I wore wrist braces and had my first morning without these symptoms.  I also took a Celebrex yesterday, so the combo may have helped.  Not a drug I want to take on a regular basis.  I was honestly getting to the point I needed to switch drugs, but when my MO suggested it in November, I was determined to keep trying because I only saw similar symptoms here on BCO with the other AI's, even Tamoxifen.  My hot flashes passed, so I thought maybe this hand thing would too.  Not sure it has, but I'm doing everything possible, including changing my diet to full on anti-inflammatory, dairy-free, 95% less gluten than before...90% of my diet is made up of fruits and greens (like kale, chard, lettuce, cabbage, the tops of carrots & beets).  Anything that counteracts inflammation (and cancer).  btw, it takes a Vitamix to eat this way, imo. The other symptom I seem to have is hair thinning, but since I went from dyed hair pre-chemo to my natural silver color as it grows out, maybe my scalp is just more evident with the color and shortness of my hair.  Atleast I have no bald spots, but I am worried about my head of hair!",

It sounds like you are trading one type of negative (the affects of heavy anesthesia versus the affects of an incision).  My BMX incisions never bothered me, unlike my chemoport incision (not greatly, but noticeably).  Not sure if the ooph incision is more like which?  Though my guess is that with a bikini cut, they have to go through muscle and that would make a whole lot of difference.  Does your surgeon do laproscpies?  I just can't imagine why he would push for the other if he did. Let's just put it this way, of the 4 surgeries I had last year, the easiest, hands down, the laproscopic ooph. btw, have you heard this discussion vis a vis the brca cancers start in the fallopian, not the ovaries??  Some are trying to get their doctors to only remove the tubes, not the ovaries.  Not sure I believe this and then there is always the ER+ to consider, but for the TN's, this might be what they're thinking about. P.S. I was not suppose to stay in hospital overnight (or so they told me) for ooph, TE exchange and port removal, but they decided to keep me as surgery got a late start and they didn't want to send me home at 9 at night.  My guess is that the ooph, alone, would be outpatient.",

I've been on a course of prednisone for an ear issue (which is actually scaring me more than breast cancer!) and I notice my trigger fingers are gone. Fancy that. Now I wonder if my ear has had enough of the hormone blocker too (or something else that could be causing inflammation). I think school teachers have one of the roughest jobs out there and especially these days. Where I can see where it could be a rewarding profession to, the fact that you have to always \"be on\" would be difficult for me, let alone all of the issues of today. No dial it in days. Thank you for your service Ginger and CookieMonster.",

It's been two weeks since my SNB.  They only took one node and it was clear.  I'm now experiencing Axillary Web Syndrome and will start PT asap.  I'm not in pain, just annoying discomfort. It is one possible outsome of SNB, but maybe the exception not the rule. I'm only mentioning it to you as not a soul told me this could be one side effect of SNB.  I only had one node removed and the nurse said I have a less than 1% chance of developing lympodema from this operation with only one node.  The PT will give me exercise and supposdedly some massage. I had the operation in the morning..I quit take pain medicaiton by 2 AM the next morning. Mostly it is just sore.  After about 7 days I could sleep on that side. I think if I didn't have this AWS I would feel almost 100%.  Having the arm lie on the incision while sleeping is problemmatic still (when on my good side - curiously enough), but if I sleep on that opposite side, I just prop my arm above my side wit a large pillow. ",

I got some immediate relief, but I think most of my relief has come from Celebrex.  The night of the PT session, it seemed to have gotten worse, and after forgetting to take my Celebrex last night, the pulling at my inner elbow is significantly worse than pre-PT.  The PT did massage, some heat, and some exercises.   My physician's nurse said only 1% of SNB develop LE and AWS is not a precursor to LE.   Thoughts? ",
