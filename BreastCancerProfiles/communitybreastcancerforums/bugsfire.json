She is ER-/PR-, HER2+ Grade 3. Tumour size was 2.5cm The doctor has asked her to go through chemo for 3 months, radiation and herceptin.  He never said anything about her prognosis. Anyone can give me an idea or in the same situation? I am worried and afraid for her. I also understand that HER2+ usually have a higher incidence of recurrence. ",

My mom has already done her lumpectomy about exactly 1 month ago and I believe she should be starting on her chemo in due time. She will be visiting her oncologist tomorrow.  Btw, she has already done her scans for liver, bones and lungs. All turn out to be ok! I think she is very worried about Chemo and its SE.  I am praying for her that she will have limited SE and her doctor told me she probably has to do only 3 months of chemo.  Any one can shed some light?   ",

But she is trying to exercise in the morning!  Anyway thanks for all who are supporting me. It has been such a roller coaster journey and dont know what else to expect. Just hope after this treatment, no more cancer will stay in the body!!!",
