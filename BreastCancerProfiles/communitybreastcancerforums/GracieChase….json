My surgeon, who is considered the best in the area, thinks that there are too many long term risks for a nebulous benefit, esp. when cancer is on heart side, as mine is, and you are young (45). One very young rad onc said yes, another older, very experienced rad onc said \"there are no bad choices\" and told me her board thought the risks don't outweigh the benefits. I may have a level one dissection, but other than that am willing to see if tamoxifen does its job. Chemo already put a strain on my body without much benefit for a Grade 1 tumor, and I fear the study that says rads can turn a low grade tumor into a higher one, if it comes back.",

Where are you two being treated?",
