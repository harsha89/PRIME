Hi everyone - I am just visiting your discussion board  but can totally relate as I went through a mastectomy and chemo less than a year ago.   I was also given Taxotere.  Had some side effects, but all in all, not too bad....ok there were some pretty tough days for sure.  I truly wish each of you as easy an experience as possible in the weeks and months ahead.  Believe it or not, the craziness does actually come to end, and life does return to normal. I never thought I'd get through it but I did.  One day at a time...... Sending positive thoughts to each of you ...",
