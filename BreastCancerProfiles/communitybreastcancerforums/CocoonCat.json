It is easy to care for but has a bit too much volume. Seems to have more of a shine than human hair.. something about the way the light reflects off it. I call it my my little pony hair. :/ I am very grateful for the loan though because... ...My wig is still being custom made for me to my specific head measurements and from my own hair. It is a time consuming process and it will be bittersweet when it arrives, but at least it will mean I won't have to scuttle about quite as much (I am not telling many people about my diagnosis... so can't be seen out with short hair and then surprise! Long again!) Going the custom route wasn't the most practical of decisions given the lead time and the not insignificant cost, but I had spent so much money on my hair over the years I was damned if I was going to waste the investment. I will report back when it arrives with whether it was worth it. Frog, I have no colour in my face full stop. I would look like a vampire if I tried to pull off red lipstick right now :)",

I hadn't thought of trying any product that I would usually put on human hair on the synthetic, but the matte effect may be enough to make all the difference. My issue with my synthetic and the volume is it looks so styled. Like a perfect blow dry (I do not do perfect.) I have tried head bands to squash it a bit and that does help. Sometimes when I am feeling self conscious that it 'looks' like a wig I throw a sheer scarf over the top, knotted mid century style. It can look cute. Or I just pull up my damn hoodie and be done with it.",
