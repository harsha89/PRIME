      "Content": "Jan 26, 2012 02:34PM - edited Jan 26, 2012 02:39PM by three17 Thanks for starting this thread. I had a BMX Dec. 8 and began my first round of chemo Jan. 17. I have 4 rounds of Cytoxen and Adrimycin and then 4 rounds of Taxol. Later radiation. I wasn't having any major side effects until yesterday when my hips started hurting and it progressed into a full on lower back ache that radiated through my hips to my knees. It was agony and kept me up all night. My MO thinks it's from Nuelastra. I am looking forward to following along with you.",

I'm not sure if the fatigue is residual from the chemom (finished a month and a half ago) or if rads is really kicking my butt. been taking 5 hour naps each day. Although I enjoy the rest, I'm a single mom with three kids and moving in three days. What can I do for a boost of energy. Luckily I have a lot of support. As far as insurance, I feel for all of you in a financial situation. My ex dropped from insurance and never told me. I found out bevcause my pharmacy wouldn't my script for a breast infection i developed. UGH! It was realy scary to be going through cancer and worrying about money. Good luck to all of you, Hugs and prayers being sent. Thank you Stacie for starting thid thread.",
