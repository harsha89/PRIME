She is an 18 year BC survivor whose MO released her after 15 or 16 years. One of the the causes of her current heart problems was the BC radiation. So the limits might be to avoid other damage. Also, Mom let me read the letter her cardiologist sent to her PCP. It explained everything and Mom didn't have to. I learned what was going on and it was easy to write down for lookup later. Perhaps your Mom would be ok with something similar.",
