Sometimes I recite it before going to bed at night.  Sometimes I just picture my life in ten years (and say Patty is ten years out!)  - I had the best treatment available. - I got Zometa right away - I am an extensive tamox metabolizer AND had a hysterectomy - I am smart enough to research my own treatment plans or I wouldnt have had anythign but the basic treatment plan - I exercised before, I exercised during, I exercise now - I dont drink or smoke and I eat well - I supplement with cancer fighting vitamins and Vit D3 - I try to control my stress (this one I have trouble with but I am aware of it) - I know 2 people personally doing well with the same diagnosis and have heard of many many more.

His advice - which seems to work for me Always use antibacterial soap in shower (like dial bar soap) on whole body.  It cuts down on overall bacterial load. Once a week use a antibacterial soap like they give you for pre surgery (I have never done that).  Take oral antibioitic at the first sign of \"not feeling well\" He felt /feels it takes your body some time to figure out how to reroute bacteria and infection after surgery (and in my case lymph nodes removed) PM me if I can be of any other help.",

It is all a bit of a guessing (educated) game, if they knew exactly what worked ....we would have a cure.  and we don't.   What they do know is that it appears that AI is better than Tamox and 10 years is better than 5 years but some of us don't tolerate the AIs well for  more than 5 years (and more studies are coming out on that).  In the old days (like a couple of years ago) docs would just pull us off the AI and say good luck.  The difference between studies that look at groups of women (and men) and our individual doctors - is that our doctors are trying to keep us (as individuals) alive.

Department of Radiation Oncology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA. PURPOSE: To determine intervals between surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation in patients treated with mastectomy with immediate expander-implant reconstruction, and to evaluate locoregional and distant control and overall survival in these patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between May 1996 and March 2004, 104 patients with Stage II-III breast cancer were routinely treated at our institution under the following algorithm: (1) definitive mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection and immediate tissue expander placement, (2) tissue expansion during chemotherapy, (3) exchange of tissue expander for permanent implant, (4) radiation. Patient, disease, and treatment characteristics and clinical outcomes were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: Median age was 45 years. Twenty-six percent of patients were Stage II and 74% Stage III. All received adjuvant chemotherapy. Estrogen receptor staining was positive in 77%, and 78% received hormone therapy. Radiation was delivered to the chest wall with daily 0.5-cm bolus and to the supraclavicular fossa. Median dose was 5,040 cGy. Median interval from surgery to chemotherapy was 5 weeks, from completion of chemotherapy to exchange 4 weeks, and from exchange to radiation 4 weeks. Median interval from completion of chemotherapy to start of radiation was 8 weeks. Median follow-up was 64 months from date of mastectomy. The 5-year rate for locoregional disease control was 100%, for distant metastasis-free survival 90%, and for overall survival 96%. CONCLUSIONS: Mastectomy with immediate expander-implant reconstruction, adjuvant chemotherapy, and radiation results in a median interval of 8 weeks from completion of chemotherapy to initiation of radiation and seems to be associated with acceptable 5-year locoregional control, distant metastasis-free survival, and overall survival.",

BUT let me tell you about my last 3 month check up.... I went in for my reg appt.  First they do blood work.  Everyone comments on my hair (like I am the first person to come into onc office with hair!!!) Onc told me how good I look, blah blah blah, examines me, chats a bit and asks if I have any questions.  I say \"well, I cant handle the stress of tumor markers - I am hoping that now that you have been my doctor for over a year!!! that I can trust you\" She said \"Yes, just live your life.  I will call you if there is a problem - if you dont hear from me - all is well\" So - I realize that my appt was on Friday and Monday is a holiday so if I am going to hear it wont be til Tuesday.  On Tuesday I am trying not to throw up so I go to Target and get some retail therapy (a very cute purple hobo purse).  Walk in the office and my receptionist says \"Your doctor called while you were out - I put them in your voice mail\" So - now my legs are jello and I am trying not to puke.  Get back to my desk - no voice mail. Ok - does that mean it was so bad she didnt leave a message??  And why didnt she just call cell???  And now it is lunch time and I cant reach anyone and I am a freaking puddle!!!!  My friend comes in my office and tries to pull me together and while we are talking she realizes that the other girl in the office named MARY also had a doc appt last week!  So she goes and talks to her and she calls her doc office and yes, indeed it was her doc office calling with lyme disease results (negative).  They couldnt leave a message on my voice mail because of hipaa violations. Once they had the wrong Mary they just hung up. SOOOO - now I am a shaky, pukey, puddly mess and I decide - ok, i cant not know.  So I call the doc office and speak to my favorite nurse and tell her - I want my TM results.  I can't stand the unknown. They were never run.  They took my blood and never sent it out (long story as to why but it wasnt oncs fault)!  WTF?  So I wouldnt have gotten a call because the onc would have never seen results. SOOOOOO - now I am a pissed off, shakey, pukey, puddly mess and I drag my ass back over to onc office and get them to rerun my blood work and the next am at 9am I get a call from my favorite chemo nurse. No \"hello\", No \"hi mary\", Just \"9.5\"  :-)  (I love that girl) So moral of the story - it was fine, even when I was freaking out and planning my funeral outfit, even when I was scared and sure the doc was calling to tell me I had to go back on chemo, even when I couldnt trust the oncs office not to F- up, it was still fine. Ill be thinking of you tomorrow. Mary",

However, in the luminal B group-in which, compared with the luminal A group, survival was midway between the triple-negative and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -positive groups-22% of the patients were HER2 positive. Because we routinely treat all HER2-positive patients with Herceptin (trastuzumab; Genentech, South San Francisco, CA) and chemotherapy, it would be of great interest to see disease-free and overall survival for the luminal B group without including the HER2-positive patients. The major difference between the luminal A and B groups without HER2 considered would be the Ki67-1 index, which was high in the majority of patients in the luminal B group and low in all patients in the luminal A group. Examining Figure 4 in the article, one has the impression that use of docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide rendered the disease-free survival of the luminal B group without HER2-positive patients almost equivalent to that of the luminal A group. Thus, the major benefit of the luminal B subclassification may be in selecting patients who are most apt to benefit from taxane-containing chemotherapy, which would then render their prognosis similar to that of the luminal A group.",

I am having a tough time with that now.  The first winter after diagnosis, I was just finishing treatment (rads through Feb 6) and had to remind myself on a minute by minute basis not to think too far into the future.  Second winter was mostly absorbed by my dad's illness and death.  I did get a short warm weather get away each winter and we usually travel to SC in the Spring. This winter has been especially cold in the Northeast and this trip to Miami (where it was sunny and 70's every day) made me realize even more how much I hate winter and I have little faith in my future as a snow bird. Try as I might, it brings me no sense of peace (like it did pre diagnosis) to think of being a snow bird and retiring \"someday\".  I don't do \"someday\" - not in my vocab and it scares the crap out of me.  If I want something, I go for it. NOW  In fact, seeing all the older couples in Florida freaked me out.  A lot!  It makes me crazy (and yes, sad) to think I won't get there.  I know there is a chance I will and even without bc there was a chance I wouldnt but that isn't how I thought before, how normal people think.  They have dreams and I guess that is what I am grieving. To make matters worse, my husband (who is the best husband in the world) won't even consider moving.  We could swing it in a few years - my youngest will be in college in a few years and  we could sell our house, we both could find new jobs, health care (I dont want to talk about politics) changes will make the bc diagnosis covered no matter what.  But he loves the snow and NY. I even did research and found that Ashevlille, NC is one of the best town/cities to live in and started looking at real estate.  I just want everything out of life and am so afraid that I will run out of time before I get it. I know nowhere is perfect but I want to move to NC and hang out with Weesa :-( Dx 6/5/2008, IDC, Stage IIIA, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

June 5th will be 4 years since the day I was diagnosed.  I will never say I am grateful for cancer but I am a stronger person, I am a better person, I am a happier person. I have my moments - I get scared - I wish it never happened - but overall life is good and for you all I wish the same. Doesnt have to be running (only crazy people do what I do) but what you WANT to do.  Dream it, do it and don't let cancer take a single second more than it already has.

If this option is generally available from the plan, a qualified beneficiary who pays for COBRA coverage must be given the option of converting to an individual policy at the end of the COBRA continuation coverage period. The option must be given to enroll in a conversion health plan within 180 days before COBRA coverage ends. The premium for a conversion policy may be more expensive than the premium of a group plan, and the conversion policy may provide a lower level of coverage. The conversion option, however, is not available if the beneficiary ends COBRA coverage before reaching the end of the maximum period of COBRA coverage.  ",

I would like more information. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) provides a premium reduction to certain qualified individuals and expanded eligibility for COBRA. Individuals who are eligible for COBRA coverage because of their own or a family member's involuntary termination of employment that occurred from September 1, 2008 through December 31, 2009 and who elect COBRA may be eligible to pay a reduced premium amount that is only 35% of the premium costs for your COBRA coverage for up to 9 months. Additionally, if you were offered Federal COBRA continuation coverage as a result of an involuntary termination of employment during that time period and you either declined to take COBRA coverage at that time, or you elected COBRA and later discontinued it, you may have another opportunity to elect COBRA coverage and pay a reduced premium. If you have specific questions about your situation and how these new rules apply to you, you may wish to speak with one of our Benefits Advisors by calling 1.866.444.3272. You should also check the COBRA Premium Reduction FAQs. Q18: How can I apply for the COBRA premium subsidy? If you were covered by an employment-based health plan on the last day of the employee's employment, the plan should send you a notice of your eligibility to elect COBRA coverage and to receive the premium reduction. The notice should include any forms necessary for enrollment. You may also want to contact your employer directly to ask about getting the premium reduction. If you have specific questions about your situation and how these new rules apply to you, you may wish to speak with one of our Benefits Advisors by calling 1.866.444.3272.

Strangely, my MO in life even pre-bc was - enjoy every minute (hence my \"name\"), have no regrets (I say I love you to various people about 20 times a day - even before bc), you just never know.  My mother, aunt and cousin all died young, my mother in law and brother in law both died young and I have had several friends die before 40 (none of them bc, by the way).  So I should adjust pretty well, I guess. It isnt me that I worry about, its my kids - I have worked so hard to give them a safe and sweet life - the one I didnt have and now they have worry and pain anyway.  My hubby too.  And I don't want to be sick - all of us fear that with chemo and for the most part I have been ok.  Some tired days - some car sick days but overall I went on with life....even during chemo - mostly for them.  There were days I wanted to stay in bed but I got up because I didnt want them to know it hurt or I was sick.  I drove my kids to school and work and soccer each day because I didnt want them to know I wanted to lay on the couch instead.  So I will just do the same thing, going forward, except the pain will be on the inside and the bonus is I can still take Ativan :-) I will adjust and I WILL enjoy every minute - take that bc!!!!",

I know I was looking for stories like this when I was diagnosed. Three years ago I was scared, sick and bald.  I still have fear and I do have side effects - long and short term (though mine are very manageable).  But I have done more in the past three years than I would have ever thought possible - and frankly,though I will never be grateful for cancer, I probably never would have.  On Sunday I ran a marathon (30 mins faster than last year's marathon - which was my first) and Joe and I renewed our vows at the finish line in a beautiful ceremony surrounded by our kids and many of our friends (and a few strangers).  And this Sunday (one week later) Joe and I are headed out to do another marathon in Syracuse so I can reach Marathon Maniac status.  Here is my blog and some pictures... Winner at the marathon (not OF THE marathon) I married my best friend, Elvis sang to me and I PR'd in a marathon - all before 2pm! My training plan was intense  (Runner's world 4 hour or bust)  - lots of miles (I hit 1,000 for the year at mile 24 yesterday - which was my goal for this YEAR!), lots of long runs with speed mixed in which was kind of cool.  Toward the end of training I was having trouble keeping up with the speed work so I knew I wasn't going to hit 4:00 and was OK with that (this time). I checked out some race pace predictors last week and all had me finishing between 4:28-4:32.  I was hoping for 4:15-4:20. I felt STRONG for the first 10 miles and was at an overall 8:40 pace.  Was still talking and smiling. I ran with one of my girls, Bri, (not my daughter but may as well be) who didn't even train, if she had she would have lost me at mile 3.  It was getting hot and we decided to walk through water stops from that point on.  Time suffered a little but with so much in the bank, I was ok with it.  I purposely went out for positive splits thinking the heat and the 20 mile wall would get to me (which it did).  mile 10 I PR'd on the half at 1:58 and was feeling good.  Felt good right up until about 20 where I saw my friend, Bobbi (gave her a gross sweaty hug).  Decided to haul in the big guns and fuel with a NEW Clif gel.  It didn't sit well, maybe nothing would have but the last 6 were not good.  I kept moving forward, watching my overall pace go from a 9:29 at mile 20 to a 9:40 at mile 23.  Took the watch off and gave it to my friend, Jeff, at that point.  Final time - 4:24.  Oddly when I came through the chute, the volunteers had to stop me, I didn't realize I was done and just kept running!  Jeesh - finally hit my stride! Then I had just over 30 minutes to pull it together and get ready for a wedding.  I had done some research on other marathon weddings and found most people had stopped along the way, got married, and then finished.  Hmmmm - wonder why?  Could it be because they knew something I didn't?  Had a brief moment of panic when I started wheezing and couldn't breathe and started to head to the medic booth but it eased up and I just couldn't talk much for awhile.  I was still feeling sick and extremely woozy but there was a wedding to get ready for! (Notice I am leaning on the wall) My girls helped dress me (step in lace tank top, pull off sweaty \"Here Comes the Bride\" tank, lift up foot, put garter on, veil, a few baby wipes and a swipe of deoderant - good to go!) and Elvis gave the band a break so we could hear what we were agreeing to (even though we have been married 20 years and this is our 3rd wedding to eachother- one can never be too safe).  Elvis then serenaded us with \"Love Me Tender\" while our friends and family blew bubbles and we danced.  Sun burnt, sick, weak and tired...I couldn't stop smiling (and crying).  Best.damn.day.ever. ....and Syracuse is in less than a week...

Survival & Stage Survival ratesX Close Survival examines how long after diagnosis people live. Cancer survival is measured in a number of different ways depending on the intended purpose. Several examples of survival statistics are listed below. can be calculated by different methods for different purposes. The survival rates presented here are based on the relative survival rateX Close A measure of net survival that is calculated by comparing observed (overall) survival with expected survival from a comparable set of people that do not have cancer to measure the excess mortality that is associated with a cancer diagnosis., which measures the survival of the cancer patients in comparison to the general population to estimate the effect of cancer. The overall 5-year relative survival rate for 1996-2004 from 17 SEER geographic areas was 88.7%. Five-year relative survival rates by race were: 89.9% for white women; 77.1% for black women. The stage distributionX Close Stage provides a measure of disease progression, detailing the degree to which the cancer has advanced. Two methods commonly used to determine stage are AJCC and SEER historic. The AJCC method (see Collaborative Staging Method) is more commonly used in the clinical settings, while SEER has standardized and simplified staging to ensure consistent definitions over time. based on historic stage shows that 61% of breast cancer cases are diagnosed while the cancer is still confined to the primary site (localized stage); 31% are diagnosed after the cancer has spread to regional lymphnodes or directly beyond the primary site; 6% are diagnosed after the cancer has already metastasized (distant stage) and for the remaining 2% the staging information was unknown. The corresponding 5-year relative survival rates were: 98.1% for localized; 83.8% for regional; 27.1% for distant; and 56.9% for unstaged.

There are also intermediate metabolizers and extensive metabolizers.  This is all pretty new too. Vitamin D3 - have your levels checked and ask re supplementation.  Lower levels show higher levels of recurrence. Exercise daily! At least 30 mins.  Has been shown to reduce recurrence",

As far as mortality rates - your mom's oncologist may be able to help with that. There are some statstics on this site as well as the american cancer society site but they are old and don't take different treatments and types of cancer into consideration.  Herceptin is a miracle drug - one of the greatest bc discoveries over the last 10 years.  Also look into PARP (for tri negs only - maybe) and ZOMETA (as a preventative)",

Many of us were healthy eaters and exercisers before and feel like we should do MORE. That is what is so frustrating.  I dont think a piece of cake now or then for an otherwise healthy eater is going to do it.  Having a high body mass and consuming lots of simple carbs is a different story (and still may not cause a recurrence but why chance it!)",

      "Content": "everyminute wrote: Hope runsFebruary 25, 2011 at 7:48 am by Mary Katherine Ibbetson In an effort to be an athlete (who'd a thunk it??) and run like it's my job...it has become like a job.  I set my alarm, I put on my \"uniform\" (some sort of tech fabric and $100 sneakers), pack my \"lunchbox\" (Spi-belt full of Gu), punch the \"clock\" (Garmin GPS) and go put my \"time\" in while training to get the \"payback\" I want (hopefully).    Wait...back up....That is not why I run.  I will never be paid to run, I will never win a race or even place in the top 10 (unless there are only 10 people in the race) and at the end of the day I don't care.  I admit I get sucked up into the challenge of challenging ME.  Getting stronger, getting faster, seeing improvement and maybe even surprising myself now and then (like Miami). But honestly, none of that matters. I run because I can.  I run because it keeps me healthy and strong, emotionally and physically.  As a cancer survivor, I don't live in fear (I refuse to) of it coming back,  but I do live with the reality of it.  You know the saying \"Keep your friends close and your enemies closer?\"  So it's always there, hanging out in my peripheral vision - It doesn't block the view but I know it's there.  But it can't run.  And I can. So I do. Will running cure me?  Maybe or maybe not.  Research shows that breast cancer survivors who exercise regularly and intensely are less likely to recur and more likely to survive.   In the meantime, though, and maybe more importantly, the thought that it might (cure me) and that I am doing something to control something so out of my control is a powerful drug called HOPE.  And if you think hope is not that big of a deal, consider being on the other end of the spectrum - hopeless.  So to me running = HOPE.  In the middle of the night, when I wake up in fear and before I have a chance to boot it out of bed, I go over the miles I have run.  I remind myself how strong I am, how healthy I am, what I have accomplished, what my goals are and then I go back to sleep....but not for long since I have to get up early to run! So yeah, the weather is annoying, the treadmill is boring, and I can do speed work til I am blue in the face (well, that would be bad!) but at the end of the day, running keeps me sane.  It is my HOPE.

Oddly, they weren't always happy.  There was the family stress, travel,  the sick kids (why always on holidays?), trying to please everyone and be the \"perfect family\" for the day. There were bittersweet and down right painful ones: The one where first my mother in law was first ill and the first one with out her - our matriarch - stand out.  We gradually were happy again and able to celebrate, though it took time and was never quite the same. We lost Joe's brother the year I was diagnosed - another hard year.  We were a little lost and I was so scared.  I ran my first post treatment 5k that day (a week after finishing chemo) and my dad cracked his head open - so we spent Thanksgiving in the ER.  Wasn't boring.  The one before my dad died two years ago, we knew so much more, and knew it was his last, but were able to celebrate and enjoy the day with him.  He died 3 weeks later and those memories are so vivid - if I close my eyes I can still see him, singing Frank Sinatra songs, dancing in his wheel chair and raving about the food!  We were unsure until the day before, how we were going to get him home to our house for Thansgiving - so many limitations, his health, the wheelchair - but we did. This Thanksgiving will be the first that we won't all be together. My oldest daughter will be with her boyfriends family (she will come home on Saturday and we will spend the day together).  We have organized a run for our friends and having everyone over for breakfast and then going to a friends for dinner. It's still not perfect, I miss my Dad, my brother in law and my mother in law, but it's good.  Life is good.  I don't want perfect, I want real and happy. I have real and happy. I hope you all have a real and happy Thanksgiving.  PS - This wasn't meant to be as depressing as it ended up sounding. I am happy and I am thankful.

Put one foot in front of the other and just keep living.  I hope we are the generation who sees cancer be a thing of the past!",

Everyone listen to the song \"tough\" by craig morgan (youtube or itunes)  Here are the lyrics...  She's in the kitchen at the crack of dawn Bacon's on, coffee's strong Kids running wild, taking off their clothes If she's a nervous wreck, well it never shows Takes one to football and one to dance Hits the Y for aerobics class Drops by the bank, stops at the store Has on a smile when I walk through the door The last to go to bed, she'll be the first one up And I thought I was tough Chorus She's strong, pushes on, can't slow her down She can take anything life dishes out There was a time Back before she was mine When I thought I was tough We sat there five years ago The doctors let us know, the test showed She'd have to fight to live, I broke down and cried She held me and said it's gonna be alright She wore that wig to church Pink ribbon pinned there on her shirt No room for fear, full of faith Hands held high singing Amazing Grace Never once complained, refusing to give up And I thought I was tough Chorus She's strong, pushes on, can't slow her down She can take anything life dishes out There was a time Back before she was mine When I thought I was tough She's a gentle word, the sweetest kiss A velvet touch against my skin I've seen her cry, I've seen her break But in my eyes, she'll always be strong There was a time Back before she was mine When I thought I was tough    ",

If you test positive then you personally would probably recommended to have a bilateral mastectomy and your ovaries removed (if you havent done so already) to reduce the chances of a 2nd bc and ovarian cancer which are very high in brca mutations.  Your children would be watched like hawks and probably tested at 25 (dont quote me on the age).  If they tested postiive they would also have to think about what steps to take.  If they tested negative they should STILL be watched carefully for a familial link. What concerns me about genetic testing is that it gives us a false sense of security when we test negative.  There will be able to identify more mutations in the future, I have no doubt.  I had a bilateral and hysterectomy/oopherectomy so my concern is primarily with my children - I have done all that I can.

I do wear a medic alert bracelet (mostly to remind myself not to let anyone poke me) and I dont let anyone do auto bp machine on either arm.  I have had several cuts but am diligent about hand washing and it has not become an issue yet I walked 2-3 miles per day most days all through out treatment and am now back to doing some running.  I have started to do some yoga.  I have just started getting a very tight pulling sensation (I have lost a tiny bit of range of motion and I am careful about pulling too fast - feels like it could snap!).  It feels just like a tight rubber band - same as when I had some cording after surgery but no visable cording.  It seems that it started when I started yoga.  I do my stretches EVERY day in the shower.   I have no swelling and the tightness is in my upper inner arm.  Questions for the experts Does lymphadema present as tight burning sensation? What yoga poses should I avoid - I really like doing the Vinyasa yoga which is fast and furious but am afraid? Can I ever do push ups again and if not, what can I do to keep my arms toned (I dont want to do dragon boating - I dont like water :-0?  Thanks, all!

I think running definately keeps things in check but I still have to eat carefully or I gain.  I also have alot of muscle built up - actually wear a 4 or 6 - so the scale is sometimes not accurate for me. I will say - I have wicked joint pain but moving helps so even if I start out sore, I can usually run through it and end up feeling better.  I am trying to get in the habit of doing something daily - 4 days running, 2 days walking or biking and one day off.

I hope some of the newbies read this and realize that it means that life does go on.  I am two years from my last chemo treatment next week and my life is full and busy and fantastic.  I just finished running a marathon and three weeks later a 15k at my fastest time ever.  I have started my own personal training business, work with survivors in three different programs that I created at 3 different facilities, I work full time, have my wonderful family and continue to exercise (almost) daily.  Life is not just good it is GREAT. My question, maybe to some of the oldbies, is - Will I ever relax?  I feel like I am constantly running and doing and going because I am afraid to miss anything.  I dont want to miss an opportunity to do something so I try to do it all.  I have always been high energy so some of that is normal for me but on the other hand weeks like this past week where I was home at 9pm every night (14 hour days) and am doing a workshop this whole weekend is a bit much. I want it all and want it now - guess I am afriad to wait it out and plan too far ahead.... I just applied for the Operations Manager position at the fitness facility where I do one of my survivor programs.  I am sort of qualified (20 years in operations management - not as much in fitness field).  I don't really want to leave my current job - I just want it all which makes it hard to focus on what I want most. I have always said that I can have anything I want in life if I focus on it - I think so many good things have happened in the past two years because I am focusing on them BUT I may need to narrow my scope!

Wrist Tattoo Symbolism As with all tattoos, designs placed on the wrist area can mean many things to many people. In past centuries wrist tattoos were used to ward off illness and disease. Over the years many seagoing people have also relied upon wrist tattoos, especially nautical star designs, to act as their guide and keep them safe until they arrive at their destination. And in modern times many people use their wrist tattoo as a source of inspiration. When times are tough, one glimpse of their wrist design helps to carry them through their difficulties. Long May She Run is the next tattoo - next month my DH and I are both getting it on our instep(s) after we run in a local race that we have been planning on.",

I had two biopsies for atypical moles this week also that pathology is not back on yet but she  wasnt too concerned about. Zometa and blood work is scheduled for two weeks. I told her that I ran 3 miles in 27 mins the other night.  She said I am definately healthier than she is and as long as I look and feel good then I MUST believe I am. Oh - and today is my first official day without the wig at work.  Buh bye BC! For now I am staying on Tamoxifen and she will also do CDY26 test in two weeks to see if I should switch to Femara.  She thinks waiting to see what research at ASCO says may not be a bad idea since I am tolerating Tamoxifen well and new research on Femara may prove holding off is better.

      "Content": "everyminute wrote: 16 Steps To A Healthier Life For You And Your Family from the Breast Cancer Options 2011 Healthy Lifestyles Calendar   A growing body of evidence shows that healthy lifestyle factors like a good diet and regular exercise provide significant benefits, possibly offering protection against cancer recurrences about on a par with chemotherapy and the newer hormonal and drug treatments. If you combine these risk-reducing habits and also limit your exposure to toxins you will benefit even more. 1. Exercise! Breast cancer patients will be 50 percent less likely to die from the disease than sedentary women if they exercise on a regular basis. Women undergoing treatments for breast cancer benefit from moderate intensity, regular aerobic activity. 2. Control your weight. Weight is a bit confusing. If you are overweight before menopause, your risk of breast cancer is lower than average. If you are overweight after menopause, your risk of breast cancer is higher than average. 3. Spend eight hours a night in darkness to encourage normal melatonin levels. The hormone Melatonin is released at night and has cancer-fighting properties. It's the reason you get sleepy when it's dark and research indicates that melatonin also puts cancer cells to sleep. Make sure you get regular exposure to bright light during the daytime. 4. Eat an organically grown diet whenever possible. Your diet should contain fruits and vegetables, complex carbohydrates, organic protein and healthy-fats. Breast cancer has been linked to some pesticides used on non-organic fruits and vegetables and estrogen-like hormones used in raising livestock. 5. Avoid fried, char-broiled, or barbecued as forms of cooking. The Char contains PAHs polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that cause mammary tumors in animals. Can't give it up? Take an aspirin with your char-broiled meal, as studies suggest that aspirin may negate the potentially harmful effects of flame-broiled foods. 6. Avoid bleached products, i.e. coffee filters, paper,napkins, toilet tissue, tampons and sanitary napkins. Using bleached coffee filters alone can result in a lifetime exposure to dioxin that exceeds acceptable risks. The  FDA detected dioxins and dozens of other substances in conventional tampons. 7. Avoid using chlorine bleach for household cleaning or laundry. The chlorine in your dishwashing detergent mixes with steam to create a gas. When the dishwasher is opened, this toxic gas is released. Hydrogen peroxide bleaches are a safe alternative; they break down into water and oxygen. 8. Drink filtered or bottled water, not city water that contains chlorine and fluoride. A simple water filter can now serve as a valuable safeguard against toxic substances and cancer. 9. Do not use pesticides or herbicides on your lawn or garden. They mimic estrogen, a known breast cancer risk factor. A cup of salt in a gallon of vinegar will kill weeds. 10. Reduce or eliminate purchase of plastic products. Some plastics leach hormone-disrupting chemicals into whatever they come in contact with. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastics are dangerous and used in toys that children put in their mouths, so keep an eye out for nontoxic toys. 11. Use personal care products without chemicals like parabens or phthalates. They disrupt normal hormone function and are found in many personal care products. 12. Avoid alcohol. Regular, moderate use of alcohol affects the levels of important female hormones. Two to five drinks per day may be associated with a 40% higher rate of breast cancer than in non-drinkers. Women who choose to drink can lower their risk of developing breast cancer by taking 400 mcg. of folic acid or eat a  olate rich diet. 13. Use wet cleaning rather than dry cleaning which contains PERC (perchloroethylene). If you must use traditional dry cleaning, open the plastic bags on your clothing and air them out before putting them in a closet or on your body. 14. Avoid PBDE s (polybrominated diphenyl ethers) found in electronic equipment and furniture. They are endocrine disruptors linked to reproductive damage, affect thyroid hormones and may cause cancer. They are flame retardants often added to polyurethane foam, various plastics, and electronics equipment. Choose carpet pads, bedding, cushions, and upholstered furniture made from natural fibers including wool, cotton, and hemp. 15. Learn how to handle stress. Levels of the stress hormone cortisol rise with increased stress. High cortisol levels suppress immune response by reducing natural  killer cell activity. These cells are important in surveillance against malignant cells and for destroying viruses and tumor cells. 16. Learn to read labels; become an informed consumer Dx 6/5/2008, IDC, Stage IIIA, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I had a bit of a fright tonight.  I got an email about a run that I have done for the past 5-6 years.  Actually last year it was my best time ever (even pre cancer). This year it is on my 2 year cancerversary (june 5th 2010) and it made me tear up thinking how different my life is in these 2 years.  That being said - it is not all bad changes. On another strange note - I have heard of 3 people dying today.  A 20 year old girl (went to school with my daughter), the 40 year old killer whale trainer and a 75 year old woman I know.  Life really is so unpredictible for us with bc and for those without too.  All we can do is live today PS JAN - You make me look downright LAZY!!!! :-) ",
