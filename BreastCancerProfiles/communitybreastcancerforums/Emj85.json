I have an inverted nipple of this side also and that\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t breastfeed my son on this side. Pregnancy is not a possibility. It\u2019s been bleeding a little for three days now and my husband says he feels something a bit strange like there\u2019s more tissue than there ought to be and I feel it too. I live in the uk England but would appreciate any advice as I\u2019m very worried. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a history of breast cancer because I\u2019m adopted. I\u2019m too scared to go to my doctor but have been told to go as an emergency. Is it something else it could be and my mind is playing tricks on me. Thank you so much Emma Log in to post a reply",
