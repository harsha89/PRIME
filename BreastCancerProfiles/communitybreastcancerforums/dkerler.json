My hair came in curly but only lasted for 1 year. Now it is back to normal which is something I never thought I would say about any part of me again. I gained about 10 pounds during chemo but with exercise I lost it and haven't gained any more from taking Femara. Hang in there. We are strong and we are survivors! hugs to you all Debbie",
