I've literally been in constant pain since it started months ago. Southern, yes, I have tried ice & heat and it does help. I've been using it every day.  The flakiness? The Dr. just chalked it up to dry skin (on only one breast??? Seems hard to imagine I could get \"dryness\" at the same time on the same breast that's affected and no where else) so I really don't know... it still worries me.  I would love to know any other causes of peau d'orange.(and I would love to see that, yes! thank you. You may PM me anytime with that or just to say hi if you'd like  ) Thank you for understanding ((((Southern)))) Not many people do right now. Thank you for your thoughts and prayers, they mean so much to me. ~hugs~!",

That is wonderful news, and I certainly hope you do stay on this board, as you have officially been my first friend, on here :) And I have yet to obtain a diagnosis still. I am still very worried, as new symptoms seem to be cropping up faster than I can keep tabs on them... the pain is still out of this world, and I'm getting flakiness of the breasts where the redness (pinkness) is; I think that must be a terribly ominous sign. :( But I know so little about breast cancer in general, much less IBC - only what I've read so far. Feel free to write back, especially if you (or anyone else) have any insights on what this flakiness means  I'd love to hear from you... and again, I'm so so happy it turned out well for you! Please do stay on the boards :) I welcome you as does everyone else. From one Southernen gal (former) to another... cheers and go out and celebrate lady!!! :D",

I don't have any advice since I seem to be in the same place you are, but I do want to say I completely relate to your pain (both emotional and physical - well, does the papilloma cause any pain in the breast...?) Anyway, count your blessings, your little boy and try to focus on one day at a time...  I am right here with you, scared to death. You are not alone.

      "Content": "Jun 6, 2013 07:16AM - edited Jun 6, 2013 07:16AM by seattlegurrl SouthernAngel, I couldn't have written the feelings I'm going through any better than you wrote yours. You described exactly my ordeal right now... the worry, being terrified, panic, and even the days I've needed Xanax just to reduce the anxiety (but it never seems to take all of it away), sleepless nights (really sleepless nights - as of now, I've been up over 24 hours and it's past 6 am here, daylight, the time everyone else is waking up. Here I am in the morning light, sleepless with worry (terror is more like it.) So I feel you completely. You helped me so much by responding when I needed support (I still don't know my diagnosis yet, which is why I've not said a lot on here as of late; I have insurance now but am waiting on finalizing everything and hopefully get a diagnosis then). But like you, I want to know but don't want to know. It's the scariest part, thinking you're going to hear the words you dread. Others say the hardest part is not knowing; I feel the hardest part will be hearing those words... you have.... blankity blank blank (I say blankity blank blank because I'm sure at that point I won't be hearing another word the dr. says afterward!) So while I may be of no comfort, I just want you to know you're not alone with your thoughts. I and many others seeking help here are in your situation and it's so frustrating... (and mine is so incredibly painful; BTW: Is yours painful?) ...so we all know how you feel. Please lean on me and anyone else willing to listen. We are all here to support each other and I am so glad for this forum. I feel even if we are diagnosed with breast cancer (mine is looking more and more every day like IBC and getting worse; definitely not the best cancer diagnosis  ... I've come up with even more symptoms since I wrote my first post about my symptoms) and they all fit the IBC diagnosis. I'm scared to death. It's been a 2 month wait so far just to be able to get seen and I'm almost there. And that's the scariest part. I'm not the fainting type, but if they tell me it is IBC I will faint dead on the floor. I had a car accident which resulted in Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) in September 2008 that took nearly 5 years of my life (had to relearn to walk, talk and read... and 5 years later I'm just getting my feet back on the ground. The doctors said I'll never recover from that but I'm doing well compared to before. I'm a tough person, but to lose even more months or years just spins me out of control. My son already missed nearly 5 years of my life; I think it so unfair he may lose me forever too. I rambled on a bit... as usual (I'm a Gemini  ) but what I originally set out to ask you is... how are you doing now? We haven't heard anything from you since May 28... it's been awhile? How did your biopsy go? Are you okay? A few reminders I recant in my mind lately... are... \"How am I feeling today?\" (Yes I have pain but I'm alive and almost fully functional... today was a great day as I went out on the water in my kayak and it got my mind off things for a while - another suggestion - keep yourself occupied with your interests and hobbies as much as possible). And ask yourself that question: How am I today? Most likely, other than some pain or discomfort which won't kill you dead by tomorrow...the answer will be, I am okay, I am fine... I also think about my family and life as I'm very blessed in that regard - and they are supportive. But I have a husband and a son, so neither really understands much about breasts :P Hubby is in ostrich mode, it's not cancer...he says. I say it looks and feels very, very much like what I've heard and read and googled and google-imaged lol. You probably know the feeling. It doesn't appear like other benign breast conditions because the symptoms don't line up. Another suggestion is to literally \"live life to the fullest.\" I have been out soaking up the rays on the beach and kayaking (even tho' it hurts my already painful breast it's peaceful and serene and I forget about my problems for a while). Go do what you love, and do it now. Like you said, worrying won't help anything - but getting exercise of some kind, while it may not be kayaking, is going to only help and not hurt. So if you're not a kayaker, go running, go for a walk if that's easier on your body (I kno' I sure can't run right now in this pain), enjoy nature, go swimming, go to a gathering with friends... and speaking of friends, accept all invites unless it would just make you feel worse physically.... basically, just go anywhere except to the negative thoughts in your head. And I don't mean that in an offensive way, I have the same negative thoughts but am trying to deal with them proactively. For someone who is used to panicking instead of figuring out what to do next, this hasn't been easy for me! A great quote from Nelson Mandela: \"I learned that courage is not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man (woman) is not (s)he who doesn't feel afraid, but who conquers that fear.\" Conquering it seems to be very difficult but I am trying and that is all you need to do, is try. Some of this advice applies no matter what your test results btw!) I talked to a 10-year cancer survivor yesterday at my friend's house and her advice was, don't think about tomorrow, only think about today. Also keep a positive attitude and connect to nature as much as possible (or whatever you enjoy) - those were her words. She also had traditional treatment, chemo and radiation. While kayaking today, I managed to succeed at that task for a while. It's when I'm alone, the house is empty, or its night and everyone is sleeping... those are the hard times when I'm alone with my thoughts and I can't think about today and can't stop thinking about tomorrow. So I know how this feels. About the Nelson Mandela quote: courage is our only option, when you really think about it. It takes courage to win a war. Cancer is a war...but we're not even sure you have it yet; so really, try not to panic and believe me I know that is easier said than done!!! I just thought I'd pass along some advice from a fellow panicker with very ominous symptoms. I hope you've gone on to get this resolved and that you will keep us updated. If you ever want to talk about anything, I will be here for you. Still getting used to the forum, and not even sure how to check PMs yet but I'll find my way around here soon :) Take care, SouthernAngel. I hope & pray everything turned out alright for you. If it's bad news, please come back so we can help you through what could be a difficult time. If it's good news, please come back and update us so we won't worry :) I just wanted to chime in that I know how you feel but that post turned into a book. Can't help it, I'm a writer. :D Please keep us updated so we can help you through it if needed. Many of us here - if not all- would be happy to. ",

He said it did not (in his opinion) resemble the peau d'orange of IBC, and reassured me accordingly, but did order a mammogram (which I refused due to the pain; I can barely tolerate it now, how am I supposed to tolerate a mammo???) I am in SO much pain. My entire breast on that side is  just \"large and heavy,\" I don't know how else to put it. It hurts like the dickens and I think I see skin changes (definite nipple changes; but my dr. said he didn't think it looked so different than the other breast). Now I wonder if I'm just getting the \"brush-off\" or whether it is something to be concerned about or what...? The pain is definitely something to be concerned about - it's still a 10 on a 1-10! I was very nauseous today and threw up several times. That didnt make me feel any better, only more scared now that it's something they're missing... i.e. is it metastatic? I don't know :( I'm just so scared I want to cry but my husband is far from supportive right now. (No one reply to that- that will just open another can of worms) but doing this all myself is taking its toll on me. :( So he ordered a mammogram as I was saying, which I denied... and an ultrasound, which I accepted gladly. But he scheduled it out for 2 weeks from now :( So I'm still in the dark. I don't know 1) how I will make it that long or...2) IF I'll make it that long.  I'm feeling very sick and very down tonight. :(  Please say a prayer you guys, it will be much appreciated. Any and all advice is also appreciated. So glad you've got your resolution ((((Southern)))))",
