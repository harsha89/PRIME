I am due to have another mammogram in a few days to determine if the pattern has changed. I was wondering can such a thing develop into cancer years later--is there any point where these calcifications can be deemed a benign condition or highly unlikely to turn cancerous? I just was wonder if in a couple of years the odd become less likely, or if this is erroneous thinking.Â  I am assuming followup testing will continue for a while. I am a cancer survior of 8 years from endometrial cancer. Thank you for any responses! Log in to post a reply",

Melissa, I do know it was not a fibroadenoma, basically it was just the sample area tested where the tiny microcalcifications where located, and it came back benign. There was no atypia identified according to my pathology report. Beesie, thank you for sharing your experience--at this point there is only one area of microcalcifications--the rest is all clear and there are no macrocalcifications. I missed one year of mammograms, and in the course of two years microcalcifications developed! Lesson learned-- I will so ever be vigilant to keep a regular testing schedule from now on. Hopefully, if all goes well, I can go back to my yearly routine mammograms! I appreciate the help ladies--Thank you both so much!!",
