About 3 - 4 weeks ago my right breast became painful, I thought it must be my bra so went and got fitted for a new one but the pain just continued to get worse, now it has spread to under my armpit making it difficult for me to pick up my son.  3 days ago I noticed a very prominent lump in my right breast which hurts to touch aswell as a couple of smaller lumps up by my armpit which are equally as painful. Saw my doctor yesterday and she has reffered my urgently for an ultrasound, the appointment came through today and I am being seen first thing monday morning.  I hadn't been worried but now I am, but I am 29 with two kids one 9 and one 2 with no history of breast cancer. Plus I was under the illusion that breast cancer doesn't hurt. Despite my best efforts to not worry, I can't help but think that I have had something wrong for a while and I didn't act soon enough Log in to post a reply",
