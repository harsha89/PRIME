I've had dense breasts, microcalcifications & core biopsys on both breasts. fine needle aspirations probably 20 times to relieve fibrocystic breast pain. there are titanimum markers in both breasts. My doctor has scheduled me 2 times a year for digital mammography for the last 4 years.  This new BSGI test has me freaking out. They inject a radioactive dye into your foot and take pictures of the breasts looking for hot spots. The dye is supposed to attach to cancerous cells because of their metabolic function. This is my understanding and interpretation in \"layman' terms PLEASE somebody out there that is familiar with any of this I need to share!  Scared to death!",
