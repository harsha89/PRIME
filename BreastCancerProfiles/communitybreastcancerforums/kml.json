It is not unusual for liver enzymes to be elevated post pregnancy so that may not tell you anything. Your other results are good so if you can wrap your head around the good instead of the fear you might find a moment of peace. I know how hard that is. I can't say I am very good at it. Oddly enough the only thought that gave me comfort (which might sound crazy to some) is that even if they found it somewhere else, I had time. They can treat people for a long time. There is nothing you wrote that suggests you need to think that it is somewhere else but our minds seem to take us there. You are in my thoughts and prayers.",

As a mom going through breast cancer, I'd encourage you to let your mom know what you think and how you feel. I tend to act stoically -no worries, here are the facts, I'll worry when someone tells me to worry. That was my approach when I was diagnosed. I put on a good front but I was freaking out inside I thought my no drama approach was good for my kids (one of whom is also 23). My kids responded in kind. No tears, no fears, no drama. As a result sometimes during my treatment, I felt like they didn't care. I knew better but on a bad day, it got to me. Letting someone facing breast cancer know that you love them, need them and that the thought you might have to face the world without them terrifies you (even if that possibility is remote and given your mom's stats it sounds very remote) is a gift. It doesn't make it true. The only truth in those thoughts and feelings is how much you love your mother. Let her know that. Cancer is a very lonely world. I also worry that my family's drama free approach was detrimental to my kids. Looking back they each exhibited behavior problems that made their lives harder (i.e. drinking too much (older kids), grades dropping (younger kids), etc.). I think if we had gotten more of our worries and fears on the table, they could have moved forward with more comfort and confidence. I think a good cry is very healing. Trying to keep it all in is a lot of work.",
