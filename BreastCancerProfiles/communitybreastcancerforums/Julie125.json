I am writing a speech for a class in school and I chose the topic breast cancer because I know that someday it will affect, in some way, almost everyone in the class. I want people to be prepared for when a loved one is diagnosed with breast cancer or if they themselves are someday diagnosed. I want to impact my class. Please feel free to share your thoughts, feelings, or anything that could be helpful. I already have the statistics but now I need the emotion. thankyou! Log in to post a reply",
