Having just started TC on Thursday, I'd like to know a little of what I can expect.....I know the \"obvious\" stuff, like my hair is gonna fall out, I'm gonna feel run down, etc. I know that my legs ARE killing me from the neupogen. I just wanna know if there will be days when I feel \"good\". With the holidays fast approaching, I'd love to know that I'll have some good days with my lil girls. Treatment is every 3 weeks for a total of 6 cycles. In all of your experiences, what were your good days and bad days? Thanks in advance for your help :). This is so much to take in.

      "Content": "Thankful4mylife wrote: Hi Everyone, It's been a long time since I've posted here but I need some thoughts from all of you! I did my 5th round of TC on 1/25 and 6 days later I broke out in a few splotches of hives, the next evening within one hour, I went from a few splotches to HUGE painful welts all over my face, head, back, abdomen and upper legs. My lips swelled, and my throat became a little tight. My MO believes it was a delayed reaction to the taxotere (BTW....for whatever reason, i was NOT given IV benadryl at my lasr treatment like i usually am)I went to the ER and they gave me 3 shots and thankfully within minutes it was better. My MO called me yesterday to follow up and see how I was doing and also told me that now a decision must be made on round 6. He explained that standard treatment is 6, however, we don't wanna risk another reaction or an even worse reaction. So...\"we\" need to decide if we are comfortable stopping with 5 or if he loads me up with tons of Benadryl and steroids, used daily, during my last treatment. He also explained that the \"bad\" traits of my tumor as the size (I had 3 tumors which were all small...1cm and smaller.. but they were in a 3.6 cm area), and my age (38). On the other hand, he explained that the good traits were it was grade 1, stage 2, no node involvement. I'm just soooo confused on what to do and I hate when \"we\" need to make decisions!! I want HIM to tell me what to do! I've handled chemo well, other than round 1....but, if he could honestly say that 5 is fine, I'd be ECSTATIC since I am pretty over this! I'm also afraid of having an even worse reaction. On the other hand, if I stop now and I have a relapse, I'm gonna kick myself in the butt. Atone else have this happen? Or was anyone else ever just given 4 rounds?? Help!
