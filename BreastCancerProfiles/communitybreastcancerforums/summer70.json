I had mine cut approx 3 inches at 3 weeks PFC & I don't think it did any harm. It sure made me feel better! My 'nature's ombre' is growing tiresome, however...think I'll go for highlights at wk 16!",

It's such a relief when chemo is over I think there is the tendency to want to forget about all things 'cancer' for awhile. At least that's how I felt. I felt ready to do a check in after 6 months or so & It's really nice to see some familiar cappers on here (& some new ones, too). I found that my shedding really gained speed in the months following treatment. I don't know if it was partially the herceptin or the tamoxifen (which I started & decided to stop) but I was losing a significant amount of hair until about a month ago. Like Hortense, it ended abruptly. The continued hair loss came as a surprise as I assumed the worst was over once I finished taxol last April. It was really unnerving to run my hands through my hair & have major strands fall out 20 weeks post treatment! I have lots of new growth but my wimpy ponytail reminds me that it's a slow process. I have highlighted my hair a few times so I'm probably not helping the process. I started taking the supplement Viviscal in Oct & it may be coincidental but the shedding stopped & re-growth seems to have picked up dramatically. I took Biotin & silica throughout chemo & I think they helped, too. Would love to see pics & hear more about how others are faring post treatment!",

I was a steady but slight shedder during treatment- seems like I lost the most above my left ear. Steph, haven't seen the movie but I definitely have some receding on the left- maybe we are mirror images. I am also 9 months on the H & just started tamoxifen. Anyone have any advice on swimming? I am going to be in the desert next week & would love to dunk my head at least once or twice in the pool but I'm afraid of the consequences. Foolish, probably but it sounds so nice. I'm going for my first haircut next Fri & I'm going to have a consult with a hairdresser in P. Desert who specializes in colouring chemo hair. I think the hardest thing at this point is that I expected to feel more like myself at this point- I think some lower eyelashes would help! Â ",

I went to a salon that uses organic colour & had high-lites and low-lites added. I even sat under the dryer to process for 5 min! I was so nervous the whole time. During the vigorous head message in the sink I just kept praying my hair wasn't all going to fall out into the stylist's hands. Anyhow, it turned out great & I week and 1 shampoo later, my hair feels much thicker with the new cut & I don't seem to shedding. For those who are interested in extensions, I watched 2 women receive 'Great Lengths' extensions. It was a fast process & they looked really good. Apparently this type is very high quality hair & applied in a way that doesn't damage your own. It was intriguing but the the thought of having to replace them every 3 months sounds exhausting at this point. Wishing everybody a great Sunday! ",
