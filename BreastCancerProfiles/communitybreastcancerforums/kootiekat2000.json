Well after this pain started I did one and felt a little mass.  I did some research before I registered here and I never came accross anything that said pain was involved with detecting cancer.  Can someone please assist me with my question....Should I be worried about the pain in my breast or am I maybe just straining a muscle?  Is there pain in first symptoms of cancer?
