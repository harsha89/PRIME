I have since had this done again and the feel of the muscle and skin is again improved. THe surgeon has said this has improved the capsular contracture I have and I have noticed an improvement in the look of the surface of the skin, prior to this it was very thin and firm. He did say to me when I saw him last that he fully expects to be removing implants from Ladies like me and replacing them with fat grafts (c cup) in about 5 to 10 years time, but at the moment the rate a which they could remove and treat the stem cells from the fat collected would take too long but things are moving rapidly in this area of reconsrution. I am in England by the way. Rose ",

I would bring them up to date that way they will get you on breast screen programme which is every 3 years(over 47), regardless of whether you have had breast cancer or not. I think some areas within ten years of diagnosis will offer either annual or biannual mammos then after that if still under 47 biannual or over 47 every 3 years. When you go for your mammogram inform the breast clinic of your diagnosis so this is on their notes as well. My self referral is because I am only 2 1/2 years from diagnosis and still under the hospitals care, also they will only bone scan you if they suspect secondary spread this is not done routinely here. Good luck.",

Since my dx I had a mammogram at the 1 year point which will be followed by one at 3 year point, 5 year point, 7 years and 9 years, then onto national screening programme. If you are still under 47 then you get them every 2 years till then. I also have an open appointment with my breast clinic so I can ring at any time and self refer, this also applies with my oncology dept. As for scans they do not over scan here possibly because of the way we are funded by the NHS, I had bone and ct scans at dx due to local advanced bc, then again last year when I had pain on right side, I have had xrays and an ultra sound scan this year ordered by my GP again for rightsided pain, luckily so far nothing has shown up. I was not sent to a breast clinic when I was 36 having found a lump, told it was a fibroadeanome ( GP did not follow NICE guidelines) was dx at 40. Changed Gp's which probably saved my life. I have been quite happy with all my treatment and have never been refused any drugs or treatment and all is going really well.",
