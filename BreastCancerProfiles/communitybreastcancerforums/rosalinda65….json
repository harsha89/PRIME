I am a high school teacher and luckily this year had a 2 hour break in the middle of the day (both planning periods and my lunch). I taught until the term ended December 19 and continued daily radiation for two more weeks, ending New Year's Eve. I never missed a class during radiation, but I did have friends drive me there (20 minutes each way) the 3rd, 4th, and 5th weeks, just to make sure I didn't get to tired and because it was nice to chat. I might have found it difficult to teach the 6th and 7th weeks, but luckily that was Christmas break. My experience was that the simulation was difficult because I am very short, 4'10\" and have a short neck. The molds are not made for my body. They eventually did one but by the end of the second week I was very crispy in my armpit. They redid the simulation and the second mold was much better. I was told my only choices of burn-prevention were aloe or Biafine.  But, I was getting early burns all over by the middle of the third week and asked to be  given a prescription for  RadiaplexRx which I had found on the Internet.  I started using it and it actually improved my skin even though radiation was continuing.  By the end I was amazing the docs and nurses because I really had no awful burns, just the general overall redness.  I also used pieces of old thin washcloths to be between my bra and my skin at the bottom fold of the breast. They said to clean with Dove soap but I found the Cetaphil bar soap to be better.     I had a big poster in my living room with the numbers from 1 to 33 on it and crossed off as I went with 33 crossed off first. That way I could remind myself how many I had to go and see that number getting lower and lower. Good luck and be sure to speak up and ask questions - even if it seems to annoy the techs or docs or nurses.  I had 100% good experience with the docs and nurses and about 80% with the techs, a couple of whom were either incompetent or mean. ",
