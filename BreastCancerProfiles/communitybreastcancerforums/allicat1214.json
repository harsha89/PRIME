Nurse was kind as well and said she sometimes it could be just waiting on a signature.... that wasn't very reassuring. But finally got a call back mid-day on day 14 from nurse who said usually our protocol is for the doctor to give you the results, but he's in surgery all day and I know you've been waiting. So she read them to me and he did call back a few hours later. This was the LONGEST two weeks of my life. I felt I couldn't think or plan or even breathe... And people kept asking, \"how did it go?\" \"Have you heard anything?\" I know they were being caring, but the last day or so, I wanted to scream, \"I DON'T KNOW!\" Praying your results come SOON! In the meantime, try to focus on projects or something to take your mind off of it. Good luck!",

Hoping lots of cancer killing activity and minimal SEs. I am on 3 week cycles of TC. I'm on day 12 after my first Tx. After going to the ER last week on day 3 due to a high fever and staying in the hospital until day 5, I've been feeling fairly well. Hydration is the key for me! I read Fat Flush by Ann Louise Gittlemen years ago and ever since then, I have always dranked \"cranberry water\" ... 1/4 cranberry juice to 3/4 water. I drink it all the time. Makes drinking lots of water easier!. I do have a dry/painful mouth at times, but I've been rinsing with baking soda and salt every time I go to the bathroom. I have a question about hair though. My hair is thick and curly and was to my shoulders. I did cut it to right below my ears right before starting chemo last week. But I haven't seen any real hair loss. My head has been tingling for the past several days though and starting last night my \"hair hurts\". You know that feeling of pulling a tight ponytail holder out of your hair and that hair falls back but \"hurts\"... Anyway, anybody feel anything like this? Will cutting to a pixie cut or shaving relieve this?",

Thanks to those several pages back who helped me identify the rash on my head as folliculitis. I did a little research and started washing it with Hiberclens and applying hydrocortisone three times a day. It's been a few days now but it's so much better. I did ask my MO and he said I was doing the right things and didn't need to call back unless it got worse. Anyway, today I head out to a town 2 hours away for my son's graduation ceremony tomorrow. He's getting his master's degree. When I first learned about chemo, my first thought was I had to be well enough to attend his graduation ..... and without looking like a concentration camp survivor. Sadly, that's what I thought chemo would do to me. Well here it is and I'm feeling pretty good overall. So thankful! Thanks to all of you for your tips and wisdom and to KBee for starting our thread!! Allison ",

Re: Claritin and neulasta: my MO / nurse navigator said nothing about claritin. I learned about it from this board! The same goes for rinsing my mouth with salt/baking soda to prevent/alleviate mouth sores! re: husbands: Littleblue....\"smoking works best but your husband doesn't like it\" & Lynne: no one cleaned up... Ladies, Please please please speak up. Find your voice and be heard. I separated from my husband of 31 years in January because I never spoke up as I was afraid of his anger. The few times I did speak up it was ugly. Had I learned to speak up from the beginning things might be different. You --we -- are going through one of the worst things we as women can face: an assault on our breasts and hair and ultimately psyche.....things that help identify us as women. As my acupunturist said to me: You need to be in a protective cocoon of love right now to restore and heal your body and soul. Our families should be doing whatever it takes to help us get through this. My husband and I have been talking by phone regularly and the conversations usually end up with him complaining to me about old issues. I finally said ENOUGH. I am trying to build my cocoon and his anger and ugliness have no part in it! Take care ladies! I have learned if WE don't take care of ourselves, NO ONE else will! ",

I'm wearing a $45 dollar wig \"Erica\" model from Paula Young . com . It looks very natural and shipped pretty quickly. I have a \"big\" head and based on measurements had to order a large which reduces styles available, but liked this one. I'm not working at the moment, but I have several special events coming up in the next few months where I wouldn't feel comfortable in just a hat or scarf. The price is normally higher but it's on sale now.... I'm being more vigilent on staying hydrated this time as I believe that is what caused my fever to spike and an ER trip/hospital stay days 4-6 after the first round. I wanted to share two things that my nurse said yesterday that I wasn't aware of: There's a new drug out for nausea that is MUCH cheaper than Emend and works longer. It's a transdermal patch and it works for 7 days. I didn't catch the name when she told me but a quick Google search led me to Sancuso (Granistron) here: http://www.sancuso.com/patient/index.php . She said they just had a presentation training on it and it's been pretty successful. The other thing she told me that I wasn't told first time or even in chemo class....for those taking Cytoxan not only is it important to hydrate but it's just as important NOT to hold in your urine. She said the Cytoxan can cause bleeding inside the bladder and then you pee blood! She said you want to drink a lot and pee it out so it can flush out of your system. She didn't say that for the taxotere but specifically for the cytoxan. I just thought I would share these tidbits with all you! Hope you all enjoy a great weekend with minimal SEs!",

I PRAY that I can get my port out soon. Many cancer patients at my hospital have told me the docs like to keep it in. UGH! I asked my MO at the last chemo about dates for radiation and he said we'd set that up this time. All I know is that I'd start radiation \"a month after chemo\"....but I don't know if that's the first visit to the RO or what. No matter, I went ahead and scheduled these trips to see my kiddos in the month in between. We'll have to schedule doctor appointments around them.

My MO, the nutritionist, and even the hospital dining options (when I went in after the first round of chemo for high fever) included high glycemic options like pasta, white rice, potatoes. \"Butter\" came with one of the meals and it was chemical-laden margarine. I told the oncologists and resident team when I was being discharged that I was disappointed in the lack of healthy options and that margarine & chemical sweeteners were served. They looked at me like I was crazy. My MO and RO are also anti ANY supplements during treatment. They have only sanctioned me to take my multi-vitamin and extra vitamin D. Since last summer when I began to focus on my health and started eating clean, I was also taking a number of supplements including green powder and others to help support burned out adrenals and improve my gut health since I have Crohn's disease. These supplements helped me go from exhausted, depressed, and stuck on the sofa all day last July to working two jobs by December when I got the bc diagnosis. I also learned on my own that my type of cancer - 95% ER+ - was likely fed by my fat. I weighed 230 pounds last summer, my highest weight. At the time of my hysterectomy in 2011, I weighed 185 - still about 30 pounds overweight but not in the obese category. Fat produces estrogen. AND I was taking a LOT of bioidentical estrogen. I have now lost 45 pounds and after chemo will go back to eating clean (no grains, little dairy, organic fruits and vegetables, with little organic meat) . I've allowed myself to eat whatever was appetizing during chemo. My MO said it didn't matter what I ate! He said I could eat all the cabbage I wanted (cabbage & other cruciferous vegetables have glucosinolates which some studies have shown inhibit cancer cell growth) and it wouldn't matter. Well, I take the approach of throwing EVERYTHING at my cancer: chemo, radiation, arimidex, AND foods and supplements that will likely inhibit cancer growth! When my MO said I would need to take arimidex for 10 years to inhibit estrogen in my body, I asked if they did a baseline test and then monitor estrogen levels to make sure the drug was working. Arimidex is known to cause blood clots, some heart attacks, and osteoporosis. He said no that it wasn't the \"standard of care.\" It frustrates me that there is such a DISCONNECT between official standard of care and common sense natural approaches. Sorry.... I'm stepping down from my soapbox now. Carry on with your day ladies!",

Praying that you recover quickly! I have made it 8 days past TC #2. First time I ended up in ER & hospital from days 4-6 due to high fever. I stayed well hydrated and kept track on my Fitbit this time around. So far so good. But I am having a few common side effects this time around (brittle nails, tender fingertips and toes,) but also a few weird symptoms that I wanted to share with others: -mouth pain/sores plus SORE TEETH: I knew about mouth issues and have been rinsing with salt water, but hadn't heard about sore teeth. It hurts to eat crunchy things. Anybody else? -rash on head: I shaved my head (or rather my DD20 ;-) ) on day 15 after TC#1 because hair was falling out in chunks. But there's still a stubble there and it ITCHES. Looked in mirror and there's a rash of small red bumps... I only wear wigs on occasion and am mostly home going commando. Anybody else with an itchy head? Anyway, just wanted to check with ya'll.... have a great weekend and take care!! Allison",

I'm trying to go back and catch up, but its reassuring to read updates from all of you in our group. I'm now 10 days post final chemo. Toes are sore around toenails. Feel like I'm going to lose both pinky toenails. The nails are a little discolored and I go barefoot in summer around the house and am a klutz and hit them. (sigh) Anyway, I broke out with a rash yesterday but not sure if it's chemo related or not. I ate few things I hadn't in a while, like bread Friday night and it could be related to that. And my big news: on day 7 post chemo I travelled two hours to host a post engagement party for my son. (that's why I ate different foods). I was so glad to have been up to making the trip but I was pretty wiped out afterwards. The wedding will be in March 2016 and I hope I have some hair growth by then.... anyway, it certainly gives me something to look forward to after chemo and radiation! There IS life after cancer! Hope all of you are having minimal side effects this week!! Oh and I'm bummed that I don't get my port out until August 28!!! The doc only removes ports ONE day a month, the last Friday of the month and July was already booked. And there were only 4 appointments left for August! But anyway, at least I have a scheduled appointment! Take care!",

I'm separated from my husband and live alone with my dog. My 75 year old mom comes in Fri-Sun for the treatments. I really don't want her to stay any longer than she needs to. But this third time around I've been pretty much wiped out....fatigue and extreme exhaustion. Had a little nausea so took zofran and the Miralax and senokot but had plumbing problems. Nothing happened for 3 days which I know contributed to my lethargy. Then hellooo..... I have Crohn's disease and felt like a mini flare. (sorry if TMI) Also I think things have been a little rough this time around because my husband is putting pressure on me to go to marriage counseling, which I said I would do but AFTER chemo. He is an alcoholic, verbally abusive, abandoned me all the time, and has major anger and control issues. I left after diagnosis because I knew I couldn't heal in that environment. And while he says he wants to do all the right things, the very fact that he is pressuring me shows me that he hasn't really changed.... Anyway, I don't want to have a pity party but I just felt really alone this time around. I should be happy that I have a peaceful place to heal....and I am. I do have a strong faith and know that God is with me, but sometimes I just want to hear and or see another human! Oh sometimes I feel like I'm going through this so that in the future I can help other women go through chemo who are alone. Anyway, I've been reading all your posts. Y'all are doing great! I so admire those of you who are working full time and have small children. I feel so inadequate that I can't handle my poor pitiful issues. So just one more TC for me in two weeks. Then a month off, then radiation x33. Congrats to those who are finished and good luck to those of us who still have a way to go!",

I've read that the year AFTER surgery/chemo/radiation is the hardest as you've been so focused on surviving treatments and it's like \"Now what?\" I came across this blog article by a cancer research advocate from Dec 2014 blasting Melissa Etheridge and Cheryl Crow's statements in an AARP article. https://draemadden.wordpress.com/2014/12/01/on-not... Since I am ER+95% this was of most interest to me: Let's start with the statement \"beat cancer.\" It's wonderful that both of the singers are doing so well and that their treatment has been effective for them to this point. But tragically, approximately 25% of women with breast cancer have a recurrence, where the cancer has returned\u2014and for women with estrogen-receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer, nearly 33 percent experience a recurrence. Furthermore, over half of recurrences for ER+ breast cancer are detected more than 5 years following their original treatment, including after decades, as opposed to other breast cancer types that tend to recur within 5 years of the original diagnosis. Research suggests that late relapse is most likely due to \"tumor dormancy,\" where there is a prolonged phase between cancer treatment and detected evidence of disease progression. It's thought that cancer cells that were able to escape the patient's initial treatment are able to survive by hiding in a latent state for years or decades, ultimately coming out of dormancy and leading to incurable breast cancer metastases. So the important truth here is that we currently have no way of knowing who has \"beat\" breast cancer. As Dr. Susan Love has explained, \"Breast cancer can be cured. In fact, we cure three-quarters of breast cancer; the problem is when somebody is diagnosed with breast cancer, we can't tell that woman that she is cured\u2014until she dies at 95 of something else. So, we know we cure breast cancer, but we never know if any one particular person is cured at any one time.\"  It also reminds me that recent news of Rita Wilson and Angelina Jolie and their choice of mastectomy promotes that as the treatment of choice lately.... I've been asked why I didn't \"choose\" mastectomy numerous times by family, friends and my boss! I walked into my surgeon at our first appointment and said, \"Lets just do a mastectomy.\" He said it was a difficult surgery and wasn't necessary for a 1.05 cm tumor. He said that lumpectomy + radiation was as effective as mastectomy. I felt good about that choice and felt if it came back in the breast, I could go with a mastectomy then. And for people who do a mastectomy WITHOUT chemo, how do they know a rogue cell hasn't traveled outside of the breast to another part of their body? While I didn't like the idea of chemo, I like the fact that is it impacts cancer cells throughout my body, not just my breast. I don't want to second guess my choices, and I want to truly LIVE my life without the cloud of recurrence hanging over my head. But I'm afraid it will always be in the back of my mind.... :-( . I hope/plan to use it though as a motivator for a healthier lifestyle rather than a victim mentality....",

And I'm cleaning my tiny apartment today after not being able to get up off the sofa for more than half hour at a time earlier in the week. I made an empowering playlist on spotify with mainly women singers of favorite dance songs.... So picture a bald, overweight woman cleaning up her tiny solo apartment and stopping to dance every few minutes. Here's the link.

I got the call that I had IDC the day after Christmas, a Friday. Saw the BS that Monday who said no chemo, just lumpectomy and radiation. It was small. All good. So like you, I put the brave face on for my two kids (DS24 & DD20) away at college and husband. \"It's small, it's okay, we got it early. No big deal.\" My husband went to play golf the day I found out. He said, \"You okay?\" And I said, \"Yes. fine. go.\" Sigh... Well, now that the lumpectomy is over and I've seen oncologists, and now I'm facing chemo and have real concerns about radiation since tumor was on left side and implications to heart and lungs, and have been discussing recurrence \"percentages\"..... Um, YES, IT IS A BIG DEAL! My marriage was in trouble for years and I ignored and repressed anger. Before I knew mammo had issues, I found a good job, first one out of the home for years. After cancer diagnosis, and being told \"just radiation\" I separated from my husband so I could focus on healing. Well, job is going to be demanding and difficult to maintain during treatment, they will expect me to be 100%. And I thought, oh, \"no big deal. I can do this.\" Well it is a big deal. I realized that the job/company will go on, but I AM THE ONLY ONE who is responsible for my health care. I should NOT MINIMIZE the seriousness of this to appease anyone: my kids, husband, boss. So I'm going to try to control this by focusing on me. I have savings and will just live off that for the next several months. I want to try meditation, yoga, walking, etc. and not feel guilty by taking off time to do everything I need to do to LIVE!! So, LK have you tried any relaxation things such as meditation, yoga, massage, etc.? Or is the chemo just too debilitating?? Since you've worked at a cancer center, are you aware of services offered for patients that could help like counseling, support groups, etc? Good news is you have two sessions behind you! How many do you have left? Take care! I'm so glad I found this forum and this April group!",

My MO explained to me just with the lumpectomy, there's 85% chance the BC won't recur. Having chemo would give me an extra 2- 3 percentage points, so up to 88% cured. Then taking AIs for 10 years would give me another 4 percentage points, so then 92% cured. He gave me some choices on the type of chemo: TC which he says is more \"brutal\" is only 4x every 3 weeks but gives the full 3 percentage points and the other CMF which he says has fewer side effects (no hair loss) 6x every 3 weeks but only gives an extra 2 percentage points of being cured. He said I could take a few days to make the decision, so I have a lot of research to do. I am already booked to get a port in my arm (anyone else heard of this?) on Wed, April 8, and the first chemo on Friday, April 10. Anyone know anything about differences between TC & CMF?

I was able to talk one on one with the nurse navigator about my choice between TC and CMF, discussing pros and cons. We met the nutritionist and social workers assigned to us and were made to feel comfortable to call whenever we have a question. I've decided to go with TC. I have Crohn's disease and the nurse navigator said one side effect of the 5Fu in CMF was diarrhea and that was a problem with Crohn's patients. So.... bye bye hair. The nurse navigator also gave us a tour of where they actually do the infusions and it is not at all what I expected. It's not stark white crowded and noisy like the hospital's lab where I get blood drawn. The cancer center is a separate building right by the Mississippi River. The infusion center is on the top floor and there are big picture windows so you can overlook the river and watch ships go by. In addition each patient has their own little area for the infusion with lounge chairs for patient and one visitor, own TV, wifi, etc. It was quiet and serene.... I also found out the cancer center offers free yoga classes to cancer patients. I'm planning on going this Thursday to check it out. I've never done yoga but have read so much that this will help. Kbee: My dad was a firechief and when I was a baby we lived in our community firehouse. Firefighters do form an awesome bond; kudos to you for the great support! Rockerwife: How wonderful that you were able to reach that student! Sprite: I agree that if you can get desk assignment that would be preferable, otherwise you need to take a leave of absence. I know it's important to keep routines and stay active, but at the same time you need to put your health above all else. I've learned if WE don't make our health a top priority, sadly no one else will. Welcome to all newcomers! A bit about me: I'm getting my port put in on Wed, April 8 and my first chemo session is Friday, April 10. My kids (DS23 and DD19) are coming in for Easter. My daughter's birthday is Saturday, she'll be 20. I separated from my husband right after my diagnosis because he is an alcoholic and verbally abusive. I sent an email to my group of women friends in February explaining why I left and they betrayed me by printing it out and putting it on my husband's car. I got a job in December that helped me get an apartment and I was getting close to several women there. The HR director said for me not to get close and tell my problems to them. I told them of the bc diagnosis from the beginning, but we thought all I needed was radiation up until a week ago when I got the oncotype results. Anyway, the company is family owned and when I came in Monday to say I was going through with chemo but would be out frequently getting blood work regularly and other things, and need to leave that afternoon for a chemo class, they thought it best to part ways. I was still technically working for a temporary agency and not hired by the company and they have an \"employment at will\" policy so they could drop me at any time. So I envy those of you with a great support system at home and at work. My mother will come in for each treatment. I'm seeing an accupunturist, a therapist, and just had a reiki session last night. I have one friend I still stay in touch with from my old circle of friends who I know didn't betray me. I'm also staying in touch with a woman I met at the job I just left. In the meantime, I'm working on developing a daily routine that will keep me healthy and sane including exercise, some light housework, garden work, walking my dog, etc. I'm also thinking of finding some part-time work but not sure who will hire me once I lose my hair or exactly what I will be able to do. Anyway, sorry for the long pity party post. I do know I'll get through this and I know that a positive attitude will help tremendously. I'm just a little low this morning.... Good luck to all getting treatments today!",

The bruise and redness was below the bandage and above the elbow. I did call yesterday and they told me to watch for a few things: if skin was hotter where bruise/redness was, to mark the edge of the bruise/redness with a sharpie and see if it extended beyond that during the day, monitor my fever. All those things were okay during the day yesterday. I took Tylenol and was able to move around and get a few things done to get ready for my first infusion today. So I just remembered this morning that I have a large leopard print Snuggie that I am going to bring with me! I'm thinking it will be perfect to keep me warm yet offer easy access to the port in my arm! I'm also bringing salty snacks (gluten free crackers) and sweet snacks (organic gluten free animal crackers), cranberry water (organic cranberry juice blended with filtered water) I've lost 40 pounds since last summer when I first recognized my husband was an alcoholic and began a serious quest to focus on me and to get healthy. I eliminated just about all grains, dairy, processed foods, and red meat. It's killing me to think about having to eat things I've given up while going through chemo, so I bought the healthiest versions I could! I realize that I'm going to have to eat what I can to stay healthy though so I'm going to do what I must! I've tried off and on to lose weight before but to no avail. I had lost 20 pounds between summer and Christmas. When I got the BC diagnosis the day after Christmas, I got really serious and ate way more vegetables and lost another 20 in last 3 months. I honestly thought I would be heavy my whole life. I'm still amazed at what I did but realize now that the fat likely contributed to the strong ER+95% tumor! Now as I face my first chemo today, I'm ready for the next phase in my quest for health. I plan to have another picture in another 3 months, hopefully down a few more pounds and embracing the new bald me! I left my abusive and alcoholic husband a month after my diagnosis. All but one of my extremely conservative circle of women friends from home have abandoned me because I left the marriage. My 75-year-old mom is bringing me to chemo and staying a few days after. I do have two friends and an aunt who will check on me from time to time. You ladies are my support group and I just wanted to take a few minutes to say thank you for sharing your experiences to help me get through this.  I'll check in later possibly even from the infusion center! I want to get pics to show y'all how calm and serene it is with a view of the Mississippi River. Thanks to all of you and good luck to everyone with minimal side effects today!",

I did get the neulasta shot and still ended up in ER with 102 fever! My docs never found a reason for the fever, even after running a ton of labs and giving me two different IV antibiotics as well. When my MO visited me on the second day, he said they weren't sure if my WB count was going up or down yet. That was day 5 after chemo. When the hospital's onc team came by to say they were discharging me and asked if I had any questions, I asked if they knew my WB count was trending up or down. He said down. So they discharged me even tho count was down because I went without fever for 24 hours. I think I discovered what may have led to my fever. I'm not a doctor but I observed this when I got home. I was discharged around noon. I actually had diarrhea and vomited after I got home. I didn't drink a lot because I was afraid it would cause me to throw up more. I took my temp around 9 pm and it was 100.4! I was so upset because I didn't want to go back to ER that night. I googled how to lower temps without drugs and found to hydrate! A light bulb went off. When I first got to ER, the nurse couldn't get ANY blood from my port because I was too dehydrated! She had to put a tight tournaquet around my foott and had to draw from a vein in my foot! So, I drank room temp Gatorade and checked a half hour later and it was down to 100.1. Drank more and checked again and it was down to 99.9. So I have been really committed to staying hydrated ever since and my fever hasn't gotten above 100! So, for me staying hydrated is key to keeping fever down. Again, I'm NOT a doctor and I know it's important to call if you have a fever over 100.4. I just wanted to share with others that one way of keeping fever down is to stay hydrated! Good luck everyone!",

I'm heading back to the bar on Friday for tx#2. I saw this story about Shelley Smith, an ESPN reporter who is going back to work after being gone for several months having chemo and radiation. She's covering the NFL draft and should be on tonight and tomorrow. She's going commando -- bald! What a brave soul to do so on national TV in a traditional man's world! Edited to add: I tried posting the link and it won't work. You'll have to Google Shelley Smith to see the story. But here's a quote that I found interesting: \"I never once dreaded going into chemo or cutting my hair or walking around bald. Yea, some people stare. But I want them to know I'm fighting.\" -- Shelley Smith Great attitude! ",

A friend who went through chemo and is now cancer free for 8 years says do whatever you can to take as much control over what you can since so much of it is out of your control. She shaved her head as soon as she started losing her hair, and suggested I do the same. A few posts ago I said that my MO gave me a choice of which chemo combo to use TC (which he said was \"brutal\" every 3 wks x4) or CMF (less brutal, keep your hair, every 3 wks x6). I was leaning towards CMF but in doing research I found a study that showed long-term cognitive issues from CMF from women who had it 20 years ago. http://www.cancer.net/new-study-shows-breast-cance... And the TC offers an extra percentage point against recurrence than the CMF, so I'm thinking I'm going to go with TC. I want to know that I've done all that I can to prevent recurrence.... so taking the \"tougher\" chemo, but also plan to continue eating clean, exercising, etc long term (as much as I can during chemo...) KBee, thanks for letting me know you felt TC was tough but doable! Did you need someone in your home to help you? I'm separated from my husband so living alone... not sure how much help I'm going to need... Lynne, your hair looks great! Good idea to get your kids used to seeing you with less hair now. My kids are out of the house, DD19 (well she'll be 20 in a week, her bday is 4/4) and my son is 23. They are both away at college but will both be in for Easter for the first time since Christmas and the last time together until Thanksgiving. I'm thinking we're going to get have to get some family pictures before my hair falls out! In fact my son graduates May 15 from grad school. If the schedule holds as it appears now, I'll be in between Chemo 2 & 3 for his graduation.... right when it seems the hair comes out in clumps. My aunt is a hairdresser so she is advising me on hair issues. She said I should cut my hair short soon, it's thick and shoulder length now. Anyway, Rockerwife looks like I'll be a few days behind you but we'll both be doing TC. I get my port on April 8 and my first chemo date is April 10. Ankledolphin: Sorry you're having a rough time with the port. I'm kind of scared about that TBH, but alas I have horrible veins. Where is your port? My MO says he wants to put it in my arm... Anyway, glad to have a decision made on the chemo option and just ready to get started to get it over.... And so glad to be part of this group!",

I'm gathering things to have in house to prepare and making a list for my \"chemo bag\". I have a dumb question though: I've read that having popsicles during treatment helps prevent mouth sores. How do you keep them frozen during treatment? I have a soft pack ice chest I was planning to bring, but that's to keep things cold, not frozen. Any suggestions from those already starting???

Hope you're on the mend soon. God1st: welcome to our group! You've got your hands full! Wish you all the best! Saraab: You're single....do you have anyone to come with you for a few days or at least to check in on you from time to time??? I'm 52 newly separated after 31 years but needed to break free from my alcoholic/abusive husband once I learned of this diagnosis right after Christmas. Yesterday was my first infusion and it was a doozy. Lab wanted to stick me on my lumpectomy/node arm. I said no. (On Wed the lab I had before port stuck in left arm after I protested. They said it wouldn't be a problem. I told that to the international radiology people and they said speak up and say no next time, so I did!) Lab workers on Friday said I had to go up to infusion floor b/c they couldn't access port. I got there and asked them why I needed new CBC, CMP tests when I had them on Wed before port. \"oh yea, you probably don't need it.\" I called ahead on Wednesday to change my pharmacy to the hospital's one to make sure I could get all prescriptions before 5 pm and make sure no problems with prior approval. Hadn't been done. AND to top it all off, I got to the infusion floor 10 minutes before my appointment and checked in, or so I thought. By 2:45 I hadn't been called and others were going before me. So I went to front desk and they had me listed as \"present\" but not \"checked in\" . duh... Then it hurt like crazy when they were feeling the port to stick in the needle. I asked for ativan and they called doc and he authorized it, thank goodness. After that rough start, it ended ok. I got steroids, then aloxi plus emend, then a shot of ativan, then taxotere and cytoxan slowly. No bad response at all. Felt a little tired last night. Drank a ton of fluids. Ate a little soup. Came home with scripts for steroids and zofran. I'm taking them as needed. Went at 9:30 this morning for neulasta shot. Took claritin for past few days based on advice of these boards. Nurse yesterday said that might be a good idea. I really do like my doctors and nurses overall. But the bottom line and reason why I wanted to share this was because we all have to be our own health advocate. They all look alike with their lab coats on, but they are so individualized in what they do. lab workers can only do what they are told. nurses as wonderful as they are, can't authorize meds without a doc. We need to speak up more and you can be sure I will continue to do so from now on! Anyway, I hope y'all are having a great weekend! Felt good enough today to get my first cut on the way to bald:  Will work my way to a pixie cut next. My aunt is a hairdresser and she came over and did it for me. Hope ya'll have a great weekend!",

Rockerwife started TC on 4/7 so she's ahead of us a little....We'll have to all compare notes on TC as we go forward. I'm doing okay but it's just been 24 hours. I'm a little tired. Feel like my legs are walking thru muck. No nausea. No mouth sores, etc. BUT I've read most SEs hit 3-5 days after. Also, my MO didn't tell me until Friday, but I got a neulasta shot today, day after Chemo. It's to stimulate building of white blood cells after chemo tries to kill them. What I learned from this board is to start taking claritin daily to help alleviate some of the bone pain neulasta can cause. So I started Thursday. I came home with a steroid in pill form to take today and each morning after chemo, as well as Zofran once a day. But again, I learned from these boards that these meds are constipating, so I also bought miralax and senokot! I brought salty and sweet snacks to munch on. My clinic did the cytoxan drip slowly to reduce nausea. So I was okay when I left. I brought my ipad with earphones, plus earplugs and eyemask. While it wasn't crowded on a late Friday afternoon, a few nurses were loud and the young couple near me were watching a \"Maury Povich\" type drama show where every other word was bleeped out. Anyway, welcome to the boards! There's a wealth of info here! ",

When I first met with him a month ago (few weeks after lumpectomy he said he would be \"SHOCKED\" if oncotype was anything but low.) MO said since score was intermediate range, chemo was up to me and offered TC and CMF. But he said TC would reduce recurrence by 3%. I had lumpectomy and recurrence with nothing else is 15%. (He said radiation does not impact recurrence at all.... um so why do it?) Taking arimidex for 10 years would drop recurrence by another 4% points so lumpectomy+chemo+arimidex for 10 years = 8% recurrence. That is better than 15% to me! I want to throw everything at it: typical treatments plus eating clean, exercising, losing more weight (lost 40 lbs since last summer and I know fat contributed to estrogen ), stress reduction, etc. So I need to get back with him this week, but he has me tentatively scheduled to get port Wednesday after Easter, April 8 and first chemo Friday April 10. He said it was better to get on schedule while I decided than to try to work in. Also, he said I would need to start chemo by end of April since lumpectomy was Feb 12. I've tried to google why this is so but couldn't find anything. Anybody know the reason for timing on this? Don't people get chemo months after surgery ?? Anyway, I've been researching on the web and talking to people that I know who have had chemo. Bottom line is I want to know that I've done all that I can to fight it. It may still come \"back\" or I may get another tumor somewhere else, but if that happens I'll know I did all that I could. At least that's what I'm telling myself now....",

I've been trying to stay positive and upbeat as I have focused on getting through chemo. But that's what I was talking about a few pages back with that link to the AARP article critique. It's damned if you do no matter what type of BC you have. The ER/PR- is supposed to be more aggressive early on. But the ER/PR+ is long recurring so how do you live and go about your life knowing in the back of your mind that everything you eat/breathe/drink/feel/do can somehow contribute to your cancer coming back. I have always been the strong one in my family: \"oh it will all be okay\" and I did the same thing to reassure my kids and hubby that all will be fine with this diagnosis. And I do have a strong faith, but I do get thoughts every now and then about \"what if?\" I do try to focus on the positive, though and eradicate the \"what if\" thinking.... But it's hard when you're alone and everyone is out doing their thing and doing all normal things...Maybe my thoughts and emotions are wrapped up in empty nest/ being separated and unsure of the future of marriage and the impact of an alcoholic/abusive husband and that stress on my health. Gkodad: My heart goes out to you. YOU are such an inspiration. Have y'all heard of that saying that God only gives you what you can handle? Well, sometimes don't you wish he didn't have so much confidence in you?!? Anyway, my last chemo was yesterday! I'm trying to stay positive for the next battle: radiation! And for me in addition to doing all the healthy things for my body by eating right and exercising, meditation, prayer, etc. I know it helps to stay focused on the promises in God's Word. Oh I did find out I get my port out in three weeks!!!! WOO HOO!!!! And see the RO and have sims the day before I'm heading for a girls trip to see my daughter and sister and nieces in the TN mountains and see my daughter perform in Mary Poppins!

I don't even know what to say except that I'm sending hugs your way. After my son's engagement last Friday, I was scheduled to back right back this week and help him while he had an outpatient procedure for a fistula from Crohn's disease. He and I both have it and his symptoms are much worse. He is so brave and has dealt with this 4 years and only missed a few days of school. Anyway, I had rash that kept flaring for 3 days before I left.... to make a very LONG story short: I ended up at two different ERs day before his outpatient procedure, one in NOLA and one in Lafayette where he is. The second one because I was going into anaphylactic shock -- albeit slowly but still scary -- complete with a fat lip, thickening tongue, closing throat, and scratchy voice. I have NO IDEA what set off the allergies, even the second worse once, because I was eating things I've eaten before with no problems. Second ER gave me steroid which first one didn't, thank goodness. Anyway, I was able to be there for son's surgery to hear his surgeon say after this procedure if this doesn't work, not sure what next step will be because he is concerned any further action will cause fecal incontinence. He's 24 and newly engaged! So I've been looking into alternative treatments and healing. His surgeon said his diet won't make much of a difference. I am grateful for my own surgeon and my son's surgeon, but I'm just so frustrated with our American medical industry that only looks at one aspect of healing and not look at us wholistically. I know I feel better when I eat clean. I know there's so much research out there that indicates the same thing. Praying for all of us today....that our SEs be few, that we feel good, that our families understand what we're going through....and that we find a way to heal these bodies so we can get back to living and loving our families.",

I just got a call that I was able to get into my clinic's weekly Chemotherapy Class this afternoon! So I'll be taking notes and asking lots of questions!! I'm still on fence about which way to go: CT or CMF. Maybe I can get several questions answered this afternoon that will enlighten me. Good luck to all!",

      "Content": "Apr 7, 2015 10:07AM - edited Apr 7, 2015 10:09AM by allicat1214 Y'all may already know this but I wanted to share something that I got from my clinic's chemo class that I just got around to reading carefully last night. The nurse navigator gave each participant a print out on their particular chemo cocktail from the chemocare.com website. http://chemocare.com/chemotherapy/acronyms/default... It's detailed info on chemo drugs. I knew that chemo lowered your immune system while it was killing cancer cells. But the specific print outs on my drug combo ( CT ) gave a timetable on when your blood counts would be low that I hadn't realized before. They each gave a similar timetable: : T: C: Nadir: Meaning low point, nadir is the point in time between chemotherapy cycles in which you experience low blood counts. Onset: 7 days Nadir: 10-14 days Recovery: 21 days Be sure to drill down to your particularly combo of drugs, then click on \"Learn more\" under each one for specifics. Anyway, for those like me that like to plan their lives any bit of info like this is worthwhile! Although, I am trying hard to stop trying to plan so much and just experience the \"now\". And I know some of the side effects listed are scary, but I'm choosing to be positive and have faith that I'll make it through! Just gathering all the info I can while I get ready for getting the port tomorrow and first chemo on Friday! If this helps even one person, I'm glad! Good luck to all of us and I pray for few SEs for all! Allison",

Called doc & nurse said to head to ER. At ER TEMP WAS 102! They admitted me last night and are running a lot of tests to determine source of fever. Good luck to all getting treatments this week. And remember your thermometer at home may not be so accurate. It's better to call and be seen. I'm on my iPad and hands are connected to IV so more later. Just wanted to share my experience to help others",

He explained to me that just with the lumpectomy, I have a 15% chance of recurrence. Having chemo would give me an extra 2- 3 percentage points, so a 12% chance of recurrence. Then because my cancer was ER+/PR+, taking AIs for 10 years would give me another 4 percentage points, so then down to 8% chance of recurrence. (He said radiation doesn't add percentage points from being cured because that is just to kill of any remaining cancer cells in the breast, whereas chemo and anti-hormone drugs are systemic through the body.) He gave me some choices on the type of chemo: --TC which he said was more \"brutal\" and would be 4x every 3 weeks for 12 weeks, but gives the full 3 percentage points for reduction of recurrence --CMF which he said had fewer SEs and would be 6x every 3 weeks for 18 weeks, but only gives 2.5 percentage points. I did a quick google search I did see that CMF is older protocol and potentially causes long term brain issues. Scary. www.cancer.net/new-study-shows... He said I could take a few days to make the decision, so I'm doing my research. I'm trying to get a second opinion with a different doctor at a different hospital, one associated with MDAnderson. In the meantime, I'd appreciate any advice/ experience/thoughts/stories/prayers on either one. Thanks so very much. Dx'd age 52. Lx (2/12/15) Oncotype score 19.
