My 87 year old mother will be having her first of 30 sessions on Monday. As her caregiver, I can honestly say that I believe I'm more nervous of the side effects then she is. She'll be having the treatment at Creditvalley Hospital - Ontario. Her RO is suggesting that 30 treatments are necessary in order to properly treat the aggressive strain of cancer she has (Non- estrogen receptive). Being 87 she already has her natural aches and pains and fatigue of old age to deal with - I cannot image what we have to look forward. Any words of experience and lessons learned and basically anything you'd like to share that you feel might help us through this journey - is greatly appreciated.",
