I instantly felt my stomach drop and felt sick. They said I needed additional pictures and an Ultrasound of my right breast.  I have to go back on June 4th, I asked if I could come in this week and the receptionist said \"I did as best as I could for you.\"  I just wish she could have been less nasty and more sensitive to the fact of what she just told me and how I must be feeling at that moment. All I can think about are my kids, and like you I keep thinking the worst case scenerio.  I try and stay positive and keep myself busy but have to run to the rest room to cry several times during the day.  When I look at my kids I just keeping think what if I am not here, what if I do not see them grow up and I start to cry again.  Thinking and praying for you and all the wonderful women on this board.  I have been reading through many of the post and it is so nice to see such strong, supportive and encouraging women.  I am happy I found this forum but wish none of us haad to be here.
