Still in pain and my pathology results came back today that I need more surgery :( really disappointed. And started my breast hurting again. For me surgery is painful. Curious how common is this? Also annoyed the site doesn't have the option for my surgery, a segmendectomy, or my diagnosis. Guess I'm an atypical girl.",

I think It's associated with me thinking about it lol. Which would make sense with brain trying to send signals there if I'm thinking about it specificly. So yup outta mind outta pain hopeful for the rest of the week.",

But they never really know anything till they do a biopsy or remove it. But there isn't anything to remove. That being said they can't find a mass or calcification, meaning they don't know what is causing the bulge they see, but it is b9 as far as ca. The doc said to do an MRI to find out if the problem persists and to cover their tush.",

I don't know if a chest MRI will show breast, but since it is on the chest it will be able to show what is causing the bulge since it sounds chest related. Good luck and hope It's all figured out soon :).",
