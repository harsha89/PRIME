I was diagnosed with DCIS in March and decided on BMX as well.Â I discussed it with both my surgeons, my oncologist, and my family. We all agreed BMX was a reasonable decision for me. I, like you, did not want to go through this again and again. BTW, I had genetic testing done and I came back negative for BRCA 1 and 2. My surgery was April 18th with immediate reconstruction with TEs. I am 11 weeks post op and life is good. Not great yet....it will be great once I have my exchange surgery. But I have not regretted my decision. It's a personal decision, one that does not come lightly. Stay on the boards and keep reaching out!! You are NOT alone! Elkay",
