So now I have begun weekly treatments of taxotere.  I just had my 5th and I have been so tired and weak and have difficulty breathing.   Not to mention everything tastes like salt.  After 6 taxotere, I will be re-cat-scanned to see how it's doing.  My pain is much better, so I am optimistic, but this stuff is harsh for me. I have very little support - my parents are gone, I am long separated, I have a son, 23, who lives with me, and then I have my daughter, 21, who is away at college in her senior year.  I try not to overburden her, but it's hard on all. I believe i will be healed, I have the best dr., and I am not used to being so dependent.  Any advice you can offer, especially regarding the taxotere, I would be grateful for.  At the present I take a steroid and about 4 percoset a day for pain. Thank you so much, Janet Dx 4/2003, 0/0 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
