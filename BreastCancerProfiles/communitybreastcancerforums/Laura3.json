I was diagnosed with DCIS, intermediate grade, atypical hyperplasia, focal necrosis.  I had two surgeries to get a clear margin, and 7 weeks of radiation. I just got the results from my genetic testing and I am negative.I have 3 aunts who had breast cancer all after the age of 60.  I was diagnosed at 50.    I finished rads on June 25.  I took a little break from my doctors and just saw my oncologist and surgeon.  Both are gently encouraging me to take the Tamoxifen.   They have been very informative and supportive of my decision.  This is the way they see it.....I have a 20% chance of developing a new breast cancer.  If I take the drug I cut those chances in half, so 10%. I have decided against it.  I am swimming, eating right and limiting alcohol.  I don't have any real extremes in my life, pretty much go with the moderation theory on everything.   Not perfect, but giving it a chance. The reason for my decision is this.   It is not the short term side effects that bother me, I can handle the hot flashes, mood swings, etc.  I have those anyway....got to love the menopausal symptoms!!!  It is the long term effects.  My sweet brother passed away last summer at the age of 56 of a sudden heart attack.  Perfect health, no weight issues, never drank, and was a doctor himself.  I now take a baby aspirin and a cholesterol medication and have a cardiologist.  My cholesterol has never been high, but they want it lower just as a precaution.  So, every 6 months I have to have blood work to make sure that medication is not effecting my liver.  AAAHHH........... So, the chance of developing a uterine cancer is just such a fun thought for me I can't stand it.  LIver, uterus, heart, breast...... Thats my story, I just don't want to take something and have to fix something else because of it. Not sure if all that makes sense.....I hope I helped a little... Take Care, God Bless, Laura",

I am feeling a little anxious about getting started, I have the next simulation on May 4th and hopefully start treatment on the 11th.  Reading what you all have shared has helped me quite a bit.  The gastrointestinal issues  was a first for me, I hadn't heard that?  Does that happen everyday?    I also have another question....My doctor told me that many women wax their arm pit at the beginning.  Did any of you do that?  She told me she didn't want me to shave due the chance of infection.   I was going to do it, the idea of too much hair for 7 weeks doesn't sound comfortable, especially as we head into warm weather. I hope you are all doing well and feeling strong..... God Bless, Laura",
