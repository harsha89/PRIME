I found a small lump in my left breast.My mammogram showed a 1.9 cm lump that was irregular (with lots of other technical terms) and the ultrasound backed this up. The Report that I read, said that this was most likely carcinoma. I've read that at least 80% of biopsies are negative for cancer .My internist called and said that it is \"BAD\" Why would she scare me this way, if 80% of biopsies are negative. I need to stay organized and a list would heI Don't want this to happen now. Any suggestions would be really appreciated.  Dx 5/19/2010, IDC, 2cm, Grade 2, ER+/PR+, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

The surgeon is very concerned about the look of my mammogram and my ultrasound. She is pretty positive that it is a cancer. I saw her on friday and she will do the biopsy on monday and she expects to get the results by wednesday. She is not dragging her feet about this. She told me that even if the biopsy is negative for cancer she will remove the lesion-area (not sure what to call it). I'm glad for that, I don't want it in my body. I will bring a tape recorder with me when I have my biopsy so I can have all the information. I will be going alone and know that I will not remember everything. Thank you for that tip, and the Prayers . A strange coincidence is that a cousin of my husbands that we rarley  get to see had a prescheduled trip to our area this last weekend. She was diagnosed with breast cancer about three years ago. It was very advanced. She is now doing well. Not at the 5 year mark-but doing very well. It was amazing to get a chance to talk to her in person. She was very comforting and had very good information. Now I think I am through my first initial fright. I am calming down a bit and will try to take it one step at a time. ",
