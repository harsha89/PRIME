I am not trying to sell or promote, I am on this forum to learn and become more aware of the changes that woman with breast cancer go through while on chemotherapy. I have talked with a few woman who have mentioned early on set menopausal symptoms and so I've decided to dive into this topic and learn everything I can about it. If anybody is willing to share their advice or history with me in order for me to have a better understanding, I would greatly appreciate. If you'd like to include your age or any other information you think is important, I'd appreciate it. I hope we can all learn something in this group discussion! A few questions: Did you notice menopausal symptoms after starting chemotherapy? How long after starting chemo did you notice the symptoms? What symptoms were the most common? (vaginal dryness, hot flashes, lower sex drive, dry skin, mood swings, passing of urine more often, etc.) Have you tried any products to help with any of these symptoms? If so, please share the product name and your experience with it. I greatly appreciate you helping me learn more about this topic. Thanks! Log in to post a reply",
