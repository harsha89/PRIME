Unfortunately in the context of this clinical trial - which we sponsor - we have strict rules to follow: one of these is that all infusions, blood tests need to happen in one of the 5 hospitals accredited for the trial (2 in Belgium, 3 in Holland). Furthermore, the CT scanner and PET scanner done in the context of the trial have to be repeated on the same machine during the study (also in one of the five centers) Also there must be a demonstration of \"failure\" of the treatment that you just started. Participating in this European trial will not be easy, since it would imply: · Satisfying all eligibility criteria (your oncologist would be needed to check this) and some of the screening exams should be performed here, · Staying in Brussels most of the time (we have a special nice house close to the Hospital in which foreign patients can stay at the daily cost of 20 euros/day, breakfast included) · Having your insurance agreeing with the treatment plan. We remain available should you or your oncologist need more information. Yours sincerely, Dr Gebhart Geraldine Dr Gebhart Geraldine Research Fellow Nuclear Medicine Dpt Jules Bordet Institute Bld of Waterloo, 121 1000 Brussels - BELGIUM Phone +32 (0) 2 541 7314 Fax +32 (0) 2 541 32 24 geraldine.gebhart@bordet.be",

But I digress.  My cancer started out ER+, PR+, HER2neu+, but after my neoadjuvant chemo, when the full tumor was excised, the PR reading became negative.  In any event, I have had twelve rounds of chemo (with 5 different chemo agents involved), double mastectomy (one preventive), a complete hysterectomy, radiation, Herceptin, and Anastrozole.  I thought I was through the worst of it, but on March 26th I got the terrible news that I have several mets to my liver, and I am now Stage IV. I am VERY interested in T-DM1, especially because I am one of those people whose hearts don't tolerate straight Herceptin well.  My ejection fraction slips pretty quickly when I'm on it, so I only got 11 infusions of what was supposed to be an 18-infusion course.  Perhaps that would have kept the mets at bay, who knows?  In any event, I am reading all I can find on T-DM1, especially to see if I might be able to get it for my DC oncologist to add to my treatment on a compassionate use level.  Is there any chance of getting T-DM1 right now, or would I have to join one of the few trials that are still working with it?  I see some are hopeful that the FDA will approve it in June--is that a majority opinion? Any info any of you can provide will be very much appreciated. I am also considering radioembolization of my liver tumors, but I first need to do a scan of my brain to rule out mets there.  That will happen this Thursday... One day at a time...I'm a Christian believer with lots of friends and family praying for me, so I am holding up quite well, despite the life-changing Stage IV status. All the best.  You are all a great resource and encouragement for people like me new to this site! Best, MourningDove",
