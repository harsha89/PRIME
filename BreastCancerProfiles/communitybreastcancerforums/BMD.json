It must be really hard to have both these things happen at once and I am not a doctor so I can't say they aren't related. I am just guessing they aren't. I do suggest you ask your gyn for something to take before your uterine biopsy. It will go easier if you are really relaxed at the time. I would call today to ask for that.

I know they are just trying to put a humerous spin on the show but it does kind of bother me to watch her with the bald head and all. I am just not in the mood for any of this right now. I probably should not have watched it.",

Although the muscle thing has not been a problem for me I do know if you are going to be going thru chemo you might want to wait for the tram surgery. I had mine before chemo and I think it just made it a lot harder. It is quite a surgery to recover from and then to add the chemo SE's on top of it was pretty rough. I made it through though so if you decide to you will too. Have you talked to a surgeon that can do the DIEP surgery or a muscle sparring tram. I had the pedicle tram only because my ps was a pioneer in it and because I have small children I could not travel to another area of the surgery. Good luck in whatever you decide. Sorry you are going through this but you came to the right place for information, love and support.",
