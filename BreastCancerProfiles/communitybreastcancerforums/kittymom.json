    "Content": "kittymom wrote: I have a family history of breast cancer. My mom is the only relative who's had it, but she did die from it ten years ago. I also have a lot of fibrocystic changes & problems. I had one surgical biopsy shortly after my mom died. It turned out to be a benign fibroadenoma. My ob/gyn found a lump last year after a negative mammogram. She sent me for an ultrasound, which was normal. She then decided to send me to a breast surgeon. I saw the surgeon in Nov. & she said that the only thing she felt in the area indicated by the ob/gyn was an area of thickened tissue. She did ask me to keep doing a self-exam of the area, to let her know immediately if I felt any changes & to come back for a follow-up exam with her & an ultrasound performed at her office (first one was done at an independent radiology center). I had this appt. last Mon. Ultrasound tech did mention the fibrocystic issues. Doctor then examined me & said that the area my doctor was concerned about still isn't showing up on the ultrasound & she believes it to be just fibrocystic. She said there is now a tiny area showing up on this ultrasound. She said that it's probably a cyst because it appears to have smooth edges. She said that it appears to be either a complicated or complex cyst (I can't remember which term she used). She wanted to do an ultrasound-guided aspiration in a couple of weeks. I took the first available appt, which is tomorrow. I'm very worried about this & would appreciate any input.  Log in to post a reply",
