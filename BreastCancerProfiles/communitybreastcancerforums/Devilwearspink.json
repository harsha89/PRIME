    "Content": "Devilwearspink wrote: I had a core needle biopsy 3 days ago and I\u2019m waiting for test results. I have some concerns about 1. The pain radiating down my arm on the side I received the biopsy. I\u2019ve had issues with that arm going numb or pain. They actually tested me for MS because of it so I\u2019m unsure if that\u2019s normal. 2. My other concern is against doctors suggestion I put my nipple ring back in (he suggested I wait a week). It wasn\u2019t slightly closed on one sid but I often had issues putting it back in before. However this time I got really hot, light headed and Nausous. I\u2019m now experiencing sharp pain in my nipple. I\u2019m curious if anyone else had this issue or if it should be cause for concern. I also took off my sports bra for the first time right after to attempt to shower. So I don\u2019t know what know if it\u2019s just pain because of gravety. Log in to post a reply",
