I had a scar from lumpectomy three years ago which had almost totally disappeared, and was so hoping this might be similar (same surgeon) but obviously this is a whole different thing, Even the way it was stitched was totally different. I'm so thankful no lymph nodes were removed this time and I have good arm mobility, and that the pathology was all clear (we didn't think there was any more cancer but one never knows--have had 4 biopsies on same side in 2 years). You've all been such an encouragement--I feel lots better today (even though I still look the same!)",

After multiple biopsies on same side (no cancer), decided with surgeon's agreement to have prophylactic bilateral mastectomies and get this over with since my risk of recurrence was over 20%. The stitches came out today. I'm appalled at how the scars look. They look crooked, puckered, and have big \"saddlebags\" under each arm. Surgeon  (who also did the first surgery) apologized for the \"extra skin\" and said he could  do a revision after this one heals. I live in a rural area with no PS in the immediate area to consult. Has anyone had to deal with this? I didn't plan on having reconstruction, but am wondering how it could even be done with scars like I have. I knew the scars wouldn't be pretty, but wasn't prepared for this. Would it be better to have a PS do the revision? Cost isn't a factor. I live in Ontario and I believe it would be covered. I have been so pleased with my surgeon so far, so don't know how to approach this.",

I haven't had a huge amount of pain, but do have \"pins and needle\", \"crawley\" sensations all around the incisions and right to the back of my arms. My chest from collar bone to below incisions is very sensitive to touch. I had rads 3 years ago after lumpectomy, and that side is not healing as fast as the other side. It's very hard and distorted, but the discomfort seems to be on both sides. I also tend to feel cold even though I'm normally very warm blooded. I also feel better in a soft bra, but if I wear it more than a few hours, it starts feeling very tight. I don't have TE's and don't plan on reconstruction, but will likely be having scar revision surgery in a few months.",

Several biopsies later, I decided to go ahead with the BMX. My non-radiated side is healing about as I expected. I have large dog ears on both sides, which the surgeon plans to take off in a few months. The radiated side is a different story. I have large, raised, very hard ridges along most of the scar, especially bad where the original lumpectomy scar was (which was almost invisible after 3 years, and where most of the radiation occurred). I haven't seen the surgeon for follow-up yet, so don't know what he will recommend. I didn't want to go though the additional surgery for reconstruction and was planning to go \"flat\", but it seems that the only way to get rid of this scarring is to have DIEP or some other \"own tissue\" reconstruction. Apparently, the radiation damages the skin forever. I wish someone had told me that when I had to make the original decision between lumpectomy and rads or MX.",

I realized that this was happening immediately after I bent over the side of the bathtub to wash my hair under the tap. I never had this problem after the BMX and am wondering what could be causing it. The area isn't painful but definitely looks like a bruise--very red spots to start out with, then turns to purple, yellow, etc. Should I be concerned or just wait until my family doctor gets back from his vacation next week?
