A little background, in 2013 I had an excisional biopsy for an unknown lump in right breast. It was B9 thank goodness. This week I had my regular yearly well women check and the doctor decided to send me for a mammo and US. I have what looks to be a bruise on left breast for 2 months and a lump under my scar on right breast. She wanted to make sure it was normal scar tissue. My ultrasound results show two lesions in right breast. Circumscribed edges. One is 16x7x10 ISO-to hypoechoic and the second smaller lesion is oval. No doppler flow. Left breast under bruise is a subtle 4x1 hypoechoic focus. Birads 3. I know a three is most likely b9. With a family history of 1 aunt with bc. I'm debating on waiting the six months or pushing for a biopsy for peace of mind. Does anyone know what the ISO in front if hypoechoic means? I think it means normal breast tissue? Thank you for any advice Log in to post a reply",

She's awesome and even mentioned if this report was hers she'd also push for a few more answers so I think she'd consider it. I really appreciate the support from you ladies.",

The surgeon ended up removing what she referred to as a \"walnut\" as well as more tissue around it. So I assume the ridge turned out to be the walnut. She told my husband it looked b9 to her. Not sure if she can tell that from looking during surgery but it made his anxiety lessen so that's good. Now just waiting for pathology and praying!",
