The ache has been constant since, sometimes being a pain worsening in waves and has now travelled down my arm, giving me a tingling almost pins and needles sensation in it and my shoulder. The ache in my breast feels deep ( like that warm, fuzzy, tight feeling in your chest when you have the flu). I can't get comfortable and have difficulty sleeping. The lump is very small, like a pea and hard. There's no history in the family, so hoping it's a cyst pressing on a nerve which they'll be able to drain or remove. Sharing in case someone else is similar and it feels good to let it out too. X Somewhere around the corner, all is well Log in to post a reply",

I'm being seen tomorrow so hoping they can give me some relief from this ache. Thank you for your good wishes and take care. ",
