As stressful as this has been it still reminds me that i am very lucky and many others have a long journey ahead of them to go. I will certainly be more diligent in undertaking breast checks moving forward, after reading through so many of these threads it is very clear that just because I am young, it doesn't mean I am not at risk.  I wish you all the best for your health now and in the future :)",

You're absolutely right- I don't know for sure yet if they were wrong or not. I am just upset at the clear miscommunication between them and my dr surrounding the results. They also didn't give me a birads rating (seems unprofessional?) so I'll try and find that out tomorrow. This waiting is just torture!",

      "Content": "HCP wrote: Hi everyone I found a lump in my left breast a couple of weeks ago. It's relatively hard, painless, and can only be felt when I'm lying down. i am 32, no family history, and to make matters a bit more stressful, also currently 31 weeks pregnant with my first. After doing a breast exam my OB recommended I go for an ultrasound ' just to be safe'. At the ultrasound, the sonographer was incredibly reassuring, he kept telling me he wasn't worried, that it just looked like a cluster of breast tissue or perhaps a hematoma but either way he was not concerned at all. He went to show the images to the radiologist who also didn't feel the need to come into the room and take another look. As I was leaving he again reassured me that I wouldn't need to worry about following up, everything was fine, blah blah blah. Imagine my surprise when my doctor called two days later saying the report he received from the ultrasound said the lump needed further investigation and to be biopsied. I'm feeling all kinds of emotions now, anger at the radiologist/sonographer - why would they tell me it was nothing and then send off a report saying something entirely different? Very frustrating. I can't get in for a biopsy for another week and i know after that it could be awhile before i get my results. Basically, I'm terrified and my mood is swinging between thinking it will be ok to planning my own funeral. I know this level of stress isn't healthy for my baby either. I have been in tears all day and just hoping to chat (and provide support) to anyone else who has found themselves in a similar situation xx Log in to post a reply",

It turns out the solid mass I have is a lactation adenoma (a collection of tissue that can resemble a malignant tumour but is common in pregnant/breastfeeding women from what I have been told). Very much relieved. It has definitely been a very long two weeks from my initial ultrasound to the biopsy and then the results today. Your BIRADS of 4b makes me feel optimistic that you will also get benign results. 80% is a reassuring statistic. I don't know what my birads was, they never gave me one but it must have been a 4 for the biopsy to be ordered in the first place. Please keep us updated, and wishing you all the best for B9 results next week :)",
