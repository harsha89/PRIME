I went a few days miserable because of it and then finally started taking fiber supplements which finally worked. Do you buy magnesium nitrate over the counter? Does anybody know of a good substitute for fish oil or flax seed. I can't take fish oil because it makes me smell \"fishy\" when I sweat and I read that flax seed should not be taken by anyone who has had ER+ breast cancer. I love flax seed because it has omega, it makes my hair and skin soft and healthy feeling plus it helps with regularity. I had my last drain taken out yesterday!!!! Amazing how removing them gave me huge mental boost that I needed pretty bad! I also received my pathology report from my surgery. They removed the IDC tumor but they also found a second tumor during the pathology examination (same breast different quadrant) that came back DCIS. I thought they had taken 4 lymph nodes but they actually took 7 and all were clear and margins around both tumors came back good. Now I go on to the oncologist for my first visit in 2 weeks. They sent the tissue off for additional DNA testing and the results should be back by the time I see the oncologist. I had no idea that they test cancers DNA, yesterday was the first I have heard of that. Guess I need to do more research!",

I feel so overwhelmed with fear right now even though I don't know what it really is. I guess 3cm seems so big that it has to be something bad right? I'm not telling anyone till I know what it is. Does a lump this large make it more probable that it's cancer? It's only been a couple of days since I went to the doc and she felt it. I have been ok up till now bit my mammogram and ultrasound are in the morning and I am in full panic mode. Why is this stupid thing so big and does that mean its more likely cancer?

The mornings seems to be the worst, I wake up and I just start crying. Not being able to control something is a strange feeling for me. I know that the results of everything and the things that the doctors say doesn't mean anything till the pathology is complete. I feel like I KNOW what it is but I just want someone to confirm it. When he told me it was malignant I actually felt relieved that my guessing was over and I knew I could start figuring out what to do to fix it. I haven't been able to find anywhere an alternative explanation about the dent and my breasts is flat section below the lump. I know there is a pulling sensation, it's not painful just kinda feels like soft contractions around it. I was trying to figure out how to describe how to lump feels and the only thing I could think of is a big fat piece of licorice. Like if you ran your hand over the side of a piece of licorice. The kicker is I don't even like licorice (except the kind the Amish make up north) so no chance that a piece of licorice got swallowed the wrong way :( lol. Did anyone else have a hard time with mornings? Oh, the place I am going called last night to set everything up for wednesday and she read something to me about a lesion next to lump, I didn't even bother asking. Have any of you heard about lesions and what that means?.",

I understand that when I push and ask questions that it is just a educated guess. I ask a lot of questions and I always start with \"I know you don't know until the biopsy result are back but in your opinion...\". Maybe they shouldn't be telling me their opinion, I don't know and I guess I don't care. I'm one of those people who just ask a lot of questions not matter what I'm dealing with. I do know that i have read that with the improvements in imaging over the years and with a experienced radiologist that they can tell quite a bit just from the way it looks, maybe I would have been better off not knowing that because I wouldn't be so aggressive with questioning them. They can't be SURE without pathology, I understand that and I tell them that I understand that. I don't know maybe I'm just such a pain and pushy that they tell me so I will leave them alone. Nobody has diagnosed me, nobody has given me a treatment plan.... just given me opinions about what they see. They could be right and they also could be wrong. I personally don't want to have cancer obviously. I guess from what everyone says it's rare for any radiologist or doctor to give opinions. When I said that she said she would consider it BIRAD 5, I started by saying \"so, I know you don't know for sure without the results but from what you see (it was a different radiologist than last week, different place too) would you still consider it 4 and she said I would probably say 5.

I have always had lumpy breasts and doc always said I have fibrous breasts. This one felt different though, I could feel the edges and it felt harder than the rest. I made a appointment and the doc stated it is 3cm x 1.5cm mobile soft mass possible indentation on my paper to take for my mammogram and ultrasound. I feel so overwhelmed with fear right now even though I don't know what it really is. I guess 3cm seems so big that it has to be something bad right? I'm not telling anyone till I know what it is. Does a lump this large make it more probable that it's cancer? It's only been a couple of days since I went to the doc and she felt it. I have been ok up till now bit my mammogram and ultrasound are in the morning and I am in full panic mode. Why is this stupid thing so big and does that mean its more likely cancer? The size is what I am so bothered about I guess. I hate not knowing how to feel. I guess in this forum to hear size REALLY doesn't matter might help ease at least some of my anxiety.

I guess that's good so I have less guessing to do. My doc called to talk to me because she was concerned about me. That is awesome and why I love having her.... she seems to truly care! She asked if I had told anyone and if not that I should. My kids are grown and out of state and I said I would tell them when they come home in November. She said I needed to tell them now and not wait till then. Kinda scary that she thinks its so urgent! She gave me the info to go on a patient portal to see my info as it comes in along the way. She said the surgeon next Wednesday has asked for another surgeon to assist and she said he is one of the leading breast cancer specialist in the state. I was told by the doc \"you need to stay positive so you can fight. You are going to need to fight\". Wow, makes me feel like they know it's really bad.",

I'm just going to do what I have to do and quit asking them their opinion before they have facts. She read something to me about the measurements and about something about the edges or angles or something and something about lesions. It said \"rule out malignancy\". I guess I'm going to choose to believe that nobody actually knows what it is in there and that I could be fine. I wish I could forget about it but I can feel the lump sticking outwhen my arm brushes across it and it always fells like it's kind of pulling (no clue may be my imagination). My breast looks like someone threw a baseball at it and it left a dent on the side of it. I just need to quit asking questions before there are facts. My biopsy is Wednesday and I KNOW they will cut a small incision and do something and thats all I know now.",

There are a lot of women who will come on here and end up ok. I don't want to freak someone out needlessly. Should I switch forums? I would like to stay in contact with all of you though and that's my only concern about switching. I would like to stay in contact with those of you that I have been talking to, the ones that are starting to go through it like me and those who have beat it equally. I just want to know about what to expect now. Nixie had shared some info but I don't know how soon I will need to make those decisions If I were to offered the option to have mastectomy and skip all of the other stuff, I think that is what I would choose. I've always hated having large breasts and always joked that I would have them reduces if I had the money, lol. Do they offer for you to skip chemo and stuff and just have them removed? Doesn't removing them lessen the chance of recurring cancer? I also wonder if this has spread to other parts of my body. Is there something I should check or be aware of changes other than in my breast? Oh, I forgot to mention that after my mammogram the tech gave me a paper with my GAIL score on it and the average women my ages score was 11.9%....my risk score was 6.4%. I had almost half the chance of getting breast cancer than the average woman and yet here I am. It's been rough this morning, I think it is really sinking in now. I woke this morning at 4am and cried until I took the a lorazipan at 7:30 and I'm done crying again for now lol.",

She said because I had fallen a couple of months ago and the counter caught my breast and it felt like it just about ripped it off. I ended up with a bruise on my breast that was huge and black and blue and yellow. This is in the same exact area that the tumor is. So she said he also noted that I had a breast injury and to eliminate the possibility that it was a hematoma (sp?). I had forgotten all about falling and when I finally told my husband a couple of days ago about all of this he reminded me about it and said I should mention the fall. When the doc was telling me it was malignant he said that hematomas can look malignant but he felt it was not likely hematoma from what he sees. So she said he put it at 4 and added a note about the injury but it was likely malignancy. I think I should get a phone recorder too so I can remember what they say word for word, lol.",

I called the local breast and cervical cancer center at the local health department. They lady said that free mammograms are now for women ages 50+. My heart sank and I was silent for a moment and she asked if I was calling because I just needed a yearly mammogram or if I felt something. I told her I felt a large lump and she said that that changes everything! I was scheduled to come in the next day to see the doc at the clinic and she did a breast exam and felt the lump also. They set me up for a mammogram and ultrasound within a few days. After the initial exam at the clinic they explained to me that when you go to them and you are under their care when a lump is found that they will pay for ALL treatment from then on but you have to be under their care when diagnosed! She said if I had gone and paid for a mammo out of pocket that I could not have been covered by them for any treatment. I now have 100% coverage for everything that will be necessary including surgery's, chemo, radiation and reconstruction! Call them and tell them you have a large lump that you can feel and they may offer to see you regardless of your age. You don't have to qualify for medicaid to receive this coverage. It is called BCCCP and they explained that it is funded by federal money not state. I swear I cried more when they told me I would be covered more than any other time through this ordeal! It is really worth the effort! Not being insured is a stress that you don't need and there are funds available through the federal government! AND, stay positive! Do what you have to do and try not to worry (I know it's hard). I have decided that worrying about it is a waste of my time, it is what it is and worrying won't change it. Worrying is just a waste of another beautiful day! The ladies on here are wonderful and can help guide you and encourage you! Good Luck!",
