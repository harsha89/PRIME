I took a coupe of Tylenol before I left and took a muscle relaxant and a naproxen when I got home. It hurts to breathe. I haven't taken anything stronger for pain in over a week, but I feel as though I may end up going there if just lying back in the recliner and waiting for the other stuff to kick in doesn't help. Ouch.",

My experience has been somewhat different; the first week or so the pain was quite difficult to deal with, but it improved quickly after that. I have been taking OTC meds with the onlly rx med being a muscle relaxant for a week now. The tiredness - oh, yes, that is so familiar! It comes on so suddenly, and when it does, I'm just done. Today it happened when I was out with my daughter-in-law shopping for my granddaughters' birthdays. Walking around in the store, doing fine, and suddenly I HAD to find a chair and sit down. I don't know if it's still aftereffects of the anesthesia, or the stress of the surgery on the body, or any/all of the above - but it is brutal. This kind of tired takes no prisoners -  Still, I have to remind myself that it has only been two weeks and I'm doing great, considering. ",
