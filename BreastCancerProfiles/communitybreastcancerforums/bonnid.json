The one thing that has bothered me throughout is that no one in the medical offices is telling me what to expect afterwards or what I will need to have with me.  When I went for my lumpectomy, I was wearing a tank top and no bra.  After surgery, the nurse asked where was my bra and the written instructions told me that I needed to wear one 24 hours for a few days after surgery.  So this time I've been proactive asking what I need.  Hopefully, I haven't missed anything!",

So that's a total of 2 out of 17.  Not sure what that's going to mean for future treatment but I should find out next week when I see my oncologist.

MI_Runner - I have not been focusing so much on the surgery as what is happening afterwards.  Originally, my bs told me that I'd see an oncologist after the lumpectomy I had on March 27th - well I went along with that.  But afterwards, when I found out I'd have to have more surgery I decided that I had to start finding out everything I could and got myself to see a ps and oncologist.  And I've been reading up on what the other women have said.  I'd take each day at a time and learn as much as you can.  Talk to the people in the doctor's offices.  I've found they're very helpful.  Good luck with your meeting tomorrow. ",

Debbie - I can't address facial hair in relation to chemo as I haven't started chemo yet. But I can address it generally as I have had it since I was an older teenager. I have had it removed through electrolysis but it didn't last for me. I think because I couldn't handle a high current. I did use electrolysis to remove the hairs on that were centered below my belly button - I was belly dancing at the time and didn't want those hairs showing. I still have facial hair and have been cutting it when it begins to show. I stopped going for electrolysis as I couldn't afford it at the time. I pretty much lost all the hairs on my legs when I went through menopause. I have recently thought about lasar hair removal but have put that thought aside until I see what happens after my chemo. I am also concerned about if and how much facial hair I will end up with after chemo. I am planning to do the lasar removal if I end up with significant facial hair. BTW, I got a referral from my dermatologist.",

When I had my lumpectemy they also did the sentinal node removal.  Apparently the sentinal node was buried below two other lymph nodes which were removed first.  My bs said that he took out the first node and when he put the counter on it alone there was no reaction and the same with the second node.  The third one he took out caused the counter to react.   Just before the anesthesia put me out entirely, I heard the noise from the counter. (geiger counter is what I think of) So when they're doing the sentinal node removal it depends on where the node is in relation to the other nodes as far as how many get removed. In my case, I think it was a good thing because the path report showed micrometasis in one of those extra lymph nodes and nothing in the sentinal. Brahna",

I left and went to have 'desert' with my daughters and my dear friend Tari.  Afterwards, my daughter Deborah asked if I wanted to go clothing shopping - yes I did, but I didn't go as I knew I needed to rest  I woke up yesterday with a fever of 101.  It was time to take the cipro that I had been instructed to take if I had fever over 100.5.  We had to be at my onc's office that morning for my neulasta shot.  Well, turns out my blood pressure was very low.  I apparently was dehydrated.  I don't know how that happened as I was drinking a lot of water, etc.  Anyway, I ended up getting rehydrated by IV for most of the day.  Afterwards, Tom and I went to Souplantation -- no salad for me.  And then last nite, I felt more naseous than I have in the past.  I ended up going through all the anti- nausea regime - 2 pills and a suppository.  Went to sleep and woke up feeling a little better. This morning Deborah took me to my appt with Dr; Wang, my accupuncturist.  I walked out feeling so much better.   She works miracles.  I appologize for not commenting on the posts.  I have been having a hard time concentrating on reading them and keeping up with everyone. Perhaps, I'll be up to reading them again soon.",

So far, so good - no adverse reactions.  Brahna",

Tried to catch up on what's happened with everyone but I can't remember it all - is that Chemo Brain. I know I blame alot on my chemo brain whether true or not. But hey, it's a good excuse I can use right now. Zuzee - I'm going to look you up on facebook. Had my last T/C tx last Thursday (Aug 6th)! So happy. I was gathering all my stuff after the treatment, turned around and found my onc and most of her staff standing there. They SANG me a congratulations song and she (my onc) gave me a bottle of sparkly - Martinelli's. Then the rest of the staff left and those, including the doctor,  who had been involved in my treatment stayed to give me big hugs. It was all so touching. Should have had my hubby take a photo but didn't think of it until after we walked out. Went back the next day for Neulasta shot. last one Yeah! It seems that unlike a lot of you, I have gotten through it all with very little SE. I had one bout of dehydration. That's when they added Emend to my treatment - for the last 2 rounds. No signs of nausea after that. I go to work (half-time) and everyone is amazed at how well I'm doing. And so am I. I blame it on my ancillary helpers: My dentist gave me a mouth rinse to use every night: Pro-Den Rx PerioCheck. My (nutritional) chiropractor gave me a list of food supplements to take (they're sold only in practitioner's offices) - the brand name is Standard Process. I'm not always faithful but I will say that when I started this journey I was faithful in taking them. And then there's Dr. Wang - the most amazing Accupuncturist & Traditiional Chinese Medicine doctor. She's so sweet and loving and cares so much about her patients. Without all of these people, I don't think that I would be doing as well as I have been. Oh and another thing that I have done/ am doing is no black (except my shoes). I have been wearing bright colors all summer. I have not thought about what might have been only that all is well right now and that's the way it's going to stay. And then I surprise everyone at work. They never know which me they'll see - blond, brunette, head scarf, cute cap. It makes for an interesting day and conversation. Hopefully this info will be helpful to someone. I had my last fill 2 days before my last chemo. The end is in sight. If I get my onc's blessing, I will have my exchange surgery Sept 30th exactly one week before my 65th birthday. I am so looking forward to my birthday!!!! Oh and last Sunday - tx4-d4 - was our anniversary and we went to the circus! I wanted to be playful.  ............   Brahna   ",

Anna - I have a cough that won't go away.  Seems to get worse later in the day.  My accupuncturist is working to get rid of it for me.  In the meantime, I get 'cough drops' from her that do a wonderous job of keeping the cough at bay.  I just put it in my mouth and let it sit in my cheek - no cough.",
