If you are otherwise eligible and want to donate, you just might need a biopsy to \"prove\" no malignancy with BI-RADS 4. There are sub-categories (A,B,C) that can help with the prediction of breast cancer. But no radiologist will give you a diagnosis. That being said... Sitting down with the radiologist to see the calcifications (and believe me, they are micro) you might be astonished at how small something can be and still be suspicious for breast cancer, be it DCIS or even IDC. This would also give you a chance to discuss how \"suspicious\" the lesion is. Breast cancer cannot be diagnosed by x-ray findings alone - only by tissue sample. How you choose to treat the results (if not benign) are completely up to you. Jan",

BI-RADS 4 subcategory C can have 95% probablity of cancer, whereas A only has 2%. Waiting another 3-6 months - I would not do that without a discussion with a radiologist who reads mammograms all the time. (And, I didn't suggest that.) The natural history of DCIS is not known. You might have this (Stage 0) or just fibrocystic disease that has some calcifications or something worse. DCIS can progress or it can sit there for years without changing - there is not enough scientific data (in fact really no studies) to say which lesions progress and which do not. But first one has to know that there is something to worry about. A stereotactic biopsy is not that big of a deal (a least mine were not - just ended up with bruising, no pain). This is just my 2 cents worth. Lots of options but best to find out what they are from an expert skilled in reading mammograms. Jan",

Thank goodness they were able to get you in for a mammo and to see a surgeon so quickly. A diagnosis cannot be made without tissue, so try not to get ahead in your thinking. (Ignore everything the med student said except for any words of comfort. They don't know enough to give advice about treatment, especially when you do not have a diagnosis.) Stick around for support. Ask questions. Keep us up to date. Try to keep on your normal routine or other activities that you find grounding in times of stress. Be sure to sleep. We are all for each other as much as we are to get info and receive support ourselves. Jan",

Usually drainage is just done with a needle and large syringe. Draining will be a relief. If you have as large an infected area as you describe, don't be surprised if you do get a brief admission for antibiotics. Do you have TEs or some other type of reconstructive surgery going on? I had a seroma drained Tuesday, and it did not hurt at all, but today the amount feels just a big as before. Going back tomorrow for TE expansion & probably another aspiration",
