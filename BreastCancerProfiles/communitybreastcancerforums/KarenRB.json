Did anyone else have this problem? Is it the large # of nodes I lost? (23) I would like to return to running someday.... If you are running, did you have swelling when you walked, or does running/walking just not make you swell?  Thanks, KarenRB 11/20/11: ILC & IDC, Stage 2b, Grade 2 , ER+, PR-, HER2-, bilateral mast, sentinel node biopsy (1/10), axillary biopsy (0/13), (23 total nodes removed), Chemo (TAC), lymphedema 2/20/12, Tamoxifin, early menopause; 2 kids (14 & 17), great husband.

But I can't seem to cope emotionally.  I am devastated and very depressed.  I am even seeing a therapist. How do you cope with this thing? -KarenRB    11/20/11: ILC & IDC, Stage 2b, Grade 2 , ER+, PR-, HER2-, bilateral mast, sentinel node biopsy (1/10), axillary biopsy (0/13), (23 total nodes removed), Chemo (TAC), lymphedema 2/20/12, Tamoxifin, early menopause; 2 kids (14 & 17), great husband.
