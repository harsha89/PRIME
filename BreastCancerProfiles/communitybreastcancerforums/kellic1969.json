My mammogram detected architectural distortion, so I then was sent for an ultrasound in which the radiologist felt it was a radial scar which still needed a biopsy. The impression this radiologist gave: Impression: Upright stereotactic biopsy of an area of architectural distortion in the left breast at 2:00, with top hat clip placement. Pathology and recommendations are pending. The differential diagnosis includes a radial scar versus malignancy. If the pathology results are benign and do not include a radial scar or elastosis, I would consider the result discordant and recommend surgical consultation. I have no clue what that means. I'm guessing that he is expecting a radial scar diagnosis? I can't stand the waiting, I should know the results by wednesday. I just wanted to assure other women who are waiting on this type of biopsy that it is not bad, the waiting is worse. Thanks! Log in to post a reply",

Consultation with a breast surgeon is recommended. lol.. I guess I go with what my doctor says and not the radiologist?",

I guess us women have to take charge of our health. If I wasn't able to see my biopsy results online, then I never would have saw that discordant remark and I would have assumed that everything was fine. My gynecologist told me not to worry about any of this, but still. What if something else is going on and I didn't know it? So, I wait for the surgical consult to happen and they may be able to make sense of this issue. Do you happen to know what happens at one of these consults? Do they sit down and look at all the testing that I had and the results and then weigh the risks to see if having this removed would be riskier than leaving it in? Again, thank you for all of your help.",

This appointment is not until November 6th. I have been dealing with this breast issue since the first week of June and am quite frankly fed up. When I had the breast ultrasound done in July, that radiologist was expecting a benign biopsy, the radiologist that did the biopsy literally told me he didn't know what it was and now he has these limitations on what it could be. So, with that being said, I left a message with the imaging center telling them I wanted another opinion and that I wanted these discordant results dealt with before I see a breast surgeon, so I will keep you up to date with this craziness.",

(I have been dealing with the uncertainty of this since early June). So I go in on the 1st to have an excisional biopsy. I'm grateful that all tests so far have come back benign and now my surgeon thinks it is as well. I'm also grateful for this board's support as well.",
