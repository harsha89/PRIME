Everything else i took was extraneous except my cellphone.  I didn't sleep great first night so was emailing friends and family (mom was so surprised to get an email so quick!  They live far away). I can read and watch stuff on this phone too so it made the night pass much easier.  Had to laugh the next morning tho - surgeon always finds me in his exam rooms playing with my phone (I hate waiting, or rather, I hate idling) and here at 7 am he comes round to check on me and I'm awake and guess what - playing with my phone!  Another patient had been yelling for the nurse which woke me up early.  I'm sure he was like 'what the...?  Does she ever stop using that phone?' :-)",

They were going to take me to a room that was private, but apparently there was a cat in that room (???) so I said just do it right here, right now and get it over with.  I realize now they were trying to be respectful and give me privacy but I was thrown off.  In the end it was nothing - over in a jiffy - but emotionally I was feeling very vulnerable.  I also had trouble getting help from airline staff to put my carry-on in the overhead bin on the trip out, so I checked it when coming home. Neither situation impacted my family visit in the slightest, but I have to say that my fuse is extremely short for 'everyday frustrations'.  That I learned, almost the hard way!  Tears and airport security do not mix <grin>",
