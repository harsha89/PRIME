My recent new dx is on the left breast...so I named my left breast the IDC breast, and my right breast the DCIS breast :) I'm fortunate that this new dx is a low grade, which means it's probably been around for a while and slow to grow. There are few mixed features to this dx. I'm also ER + ...estrogen 3+ ....and progesterone 3+ ...which my bc surgeon says is good. I looked at pictures of low grade cancer cells. They don't look much different than our normal cells. Also to mention, the tumor is small. My question is...how serious do you think a low grade cancer is? How fast does it grow? Would you wait until the summer to have it removed? Do low grade tumors met...? If so...how fast? My bc surgeon strongly suggest a mx. This feels too drastic for such a small low grade tumor. After reading post of different types of b.c. reconstruction, and even mx w/out reconstructions, I'm pretty freaked out. Plus, I work, and do not have the time to get off work for such a recovery. I am a teacher and more....no one can take my place at work! This is why I would prefer to wait until this summer. I prefer a simple lumpectomy without rads or med's. If I knew that low grade would not become aggressive, I would be comfortable with a simple lumpectomy. Has anyone here had low grades to grade IV? To add, if my dx was grade 3, I would aggressively removed the cancer asap.",

I am seeing a pain specialist to see what they can do to prevent RSD or PMPS in surgery. I admit, I am dragging my feet. Yesterday, I pretty much leaned toward alternative therapy only. The tumor seems small and un-aggressive. This morning a good friend took me out to breakfast and shared a dream where I died. I said, rebuke that dream :) Of course, she wants me to do surgery. So today, she made me a little nervous and again I'm considering surgery. Kira, what do you mean when you said, As far as grade 1 metastasizing that is a bit of a crap shoot. Do you mean grade 1 does not metastasize? To be out front with you, even if there wasn't a problem with me taking chemo and other drugs. I wouldn't take anything that would suppress my immune system. I respect other choices. I wouldn't take tx or other bc inhibitors. I don't know why I was told that with Hashiminto, I can't take them. I plan to find out. I just learned that if I had had radiation, I could have developed PMPS, or the spreading of RSD, which would have been constant fire in my chest. RSD stage 1V can be fatal...I am now stage 3 for RSD (hand & wrist injury...can spread). It is important that the doctors, and oncologist look at our medical history before prescribing rads, or any drugs.",

It's my gut feeling that bc inhibitors suppress your hormones, where my doc is trying to balance them. The two apparently don't mix. Again, I have to check further into this to know exactly why they said I couldn't take Al's.",

I want to say in sharing this that although dx with it several years ago, earlier on it was pretty bad. By sheer determination it is under control. It is mind over matter. I had several Ganglion blocks. Most of my friends aren't aware that I have a problem. In the beginning, it appeared to be spreading. Through regular swimming, hot tubs, and staying positive it is almost in remission (my right hand gets cold, joints stiff, burns and is clumsy). I am so fortunate it isn't worse. And I am an artist :) Perhaps if you read the stages, you can see why I chose alternative over conventional medicine. RSD pain isn't as acute in stage 3. It is more chronic pain at stage 3. I was stage 3 several years ago...perhaps now stage 2. Stage 1 is severe pain. if you look at pictures of it, you can see why people get depressed. It started to happen to me, but, again, mind over matter. Drugs and surgery can cause it to flare up again and take it to stage IV.. Table 3 www.rsdrx.com/what_is_rsd.htm Stages of RSD Stage I: A sympathetic dysfunction with thermatomal distribution of the pain. The pain may spread in a mirror fashion to contralateral extremity or to adjacent regions on the same side of the body. In stage one, the pain is usually SMP in nature. Stage II: The dysfunction changes to dystrophy manifested by edema, hyperhidrosis, neurovascular instability with fluctuation of livedo reticularis and cyanosis causing change of temperature and color of the skin in matter of minutes. The dystrophic changes also include bouts of hair loss, ridging, dystrophic, brittle and discolored nails, skin rash, subcutaneous bleeding, neurodermatitis, and ulcerative lesions (Fig. 5). Due to the confusing clinical manifestations, the patient may be accused of self-mutilation and even \"Münchausen syndrome.\" All these dystrophic changes may not be present at the same time nor in the same patient. Careful history taken is important in this regard. Stage III: Inflammation becomes more problematic and release of neuropeptides from c-fiber terminals results in multiple inflammatory and immune dysfunctions. The secondary release of substance P may damage mast cells and destroy muscle cells and fibroblasts. Stage IV: Identifies the final stage of RSD / CRPS manifested by: 1. Failure of the immune system, reduction of helper T-cell lymphocytes and elevation of killer T-cell lymphocytes. This is in contrast to the opposite, up-regulated function of immune system in early stages. 2. The hypertension in early stages due to alpha-1 up-regulation reverses to eventual exhaustion and to the common occurrence of orthostatic hypotension in this late stage. Blood pressure changes in this stage are due to autonomic failure. The failure of the sympathetic system exaggerates the response to drugs that lower or raise the blood pressure. 3. Intractable generalized extremity and visceral edema involving the abdomen, pelvis, lungs, and extremities due to long-standing disturbance of sodium-potassium and calcium magnesium pumps usually left untreated for several years. The same organs may eventually be subject to multiple abscesses due to failure of immune function. 4. Ulcerative skin lesions. 5. High risks of cancer and suicide. 6. Multiple surgical procedures seem to be precipitating factors for development of stage IV. This late stage is almost the flip side of earlier stages, and points to exhaustion of sympathetic and immune systems. Ganglion blocks in this stage are useless and treatment should be aimed at improving the edema and the failing immune system. Dystrophy_Clinical-Stages-of-Reflex-Sympathetic-Dystrophy.php The combination of the above three factors, use of ice, immobilization and addicting drugs, exaggerates the SMP (sympathetically maintained pain) due to the original minor trauma.",

They called and asked me back to do the mri due to it being difficult to read...too much movement, which caused lines throughout the mri. I opted out of doing it over due to taking the contrast dye so close together. So I said, try to read it because I wasn't doing it again. They instead asked me do a ultra sound that showed up the tumor. However, they only used the ultra sound in the 8 o'clock position. I thought sense I was there they should had done the whole breast. The oncologist checked my breast and said that I have very lumpy breast especially for my age. I have been told they are fibroysitic breast. It concerns me that the lumps could be mucinious cancers. My tumor was mixed, not pure, which means other cancers can hide in the mucis? They biopsied two areas. I watched it on the ultrasound. They were close, slightly a part. I wonder if they were the same or different types of cancers...? Just trying to figure out how they can say it's more than one type of cancer. I would do a mx before full breast radiation, because if ever dx again, I would want reconstruction.The possible pain issue is huge for me. I don't like any of the choices right now...the less invasive seems to be a lumpectomy with a mammosite. Also...do you believe that most bc surgeons or oncologist are aware about the mucinious info that you posted? The surgeon or oncologist did not tell me that my cancer was a favorable invasive cancer. They did not questions the lumps in my breast or suspect them to be more mucinious. Either one talked about my prognosis. They just said it will grow. I read that the mucinious cancer rarely mets or goes into the nodes. Apparently what other cancers I have are in the mucus? I am trying to picture this unusual cancer :) Another question, do you know of women here at bco who have later stage mucinious cancers? My husband is a Russian Jew...I would have a little of the European.  ",

However, I'm open to getting a lumpectomy only, and if margins weren't clear to consider a mx w/reconstruction.

I'm still unclear to what kind of test it is other than I just learned it is important if you are taking tx...possible for other reasons as mentioned by Beesie. This week, I am for the very first time seeing an oncologist. I will ask her about oncotype. Kira, you asked what kind of cancer I have on another thread. From what I understood last week it is a mix bag. The doctor said it was infiltrating dutual carcinoma, grade 1, stage 1. I have no idea of the size other than it is small. My ER is 3+ and Prog-3+ which the surgeon said was good. The bs did not say it was micro-invasion, she said IDC. She wants to remove the sentinel nodes. I was sorta in shock and stressed when I saw the doctor. My husband was able to share things with me that she said that I do not remember the surgeon saying. I was upset mostly because she was stern and firm about a mx w/out nipples. She wants this surgery done ASAP... Last night, I watched several MX and different type of reconstructions on U-Tube. I thought it would take some of the fear and questions out of the surgery. I felt sick afterwards. This feels so drastic for such a small tumor. But, like someone mentioned in an above post, it ended up being more and saving her life. I am so struggling. The whole things feels like an assault on my femininity. Beesie, anytime you want to add something else in here, please do. I appreciate your sensitivity to those who have DCIS.",

      "Content": "Hindsfeet wrote: Self breast examination and mammogram more important as you ageDespite the fact that women over the age of 65 run a much higher risk of developing breast cancer, a survey done last year by the National Institutes of Health shows that they are not as concerned about developing breast cancer as they were when they were younger. A woman's chance of being diagnosed with breast cancer is: by age 30. . . 1 out of 2,212 by age 40. . . 1 out of 235 by age 50. . . 1 out of 54 by age 60. . . 1 out of 23 by age 70. . . 1 out of 14 by age 80. . . 1 out of 10 Ever. . . . . . . 1 out of 8 The 1 in 8 figure means that, if current rates stay constant, a female born today has a 1 in 8 chance of developing breast cancer sometime during her life. There are numerous risk factors that increase the risk of developing breast cancer, including family history, reproductive history and according to recent research treatment for thyroid cancer. Despite these other risk factors, age remains the greatest risk factor. The longer you live the greater your risk of developing breast cancer.  I was looking for something else and came across this article...I thought pre-menopause was more at risk....makes sense in that as you age your cells lack the ability to copy, more likely to mutate.

I don't know if this will help or not, but I read somewhere recently that the biopsy report can be different than the final pathology report. The findings can be mixed with different types of cancer cells even in a small area, like different grades, dcis and invasive. So if the biopsy picked up the idc with the her2+ leaving perhaps less aggressive cancer cells then the final pathology report will differ. I recently had a biopsy. It was idc, with the her2+++, and high proferation count (fish) Among it was also found dcis high grade, comonecrosis the solid type. In the biopsy they vacuum out 2 C of tissue which was strong staining for cancer cells. They left very little of the califications or cancer in the breast. So the biopsy report might be more accurate than the final surgical pathology report. I actually saw the tissue after it was removed from the breast (biopsy). I thought it was a lot of tissue and asked the doctor if she got it all. She smiled, and said she left a little for the surgeon. So...I don't know what was left. On the report it did say 2 C were removed. Were dcis cells left, or more of the idc? If the idc with the her2+ gene was removed and only the dcis is left then which is the true dx? I don't know yet because I haven't had my mx yet. So...if the final pathology report says dcis, does that mean, I never had idc or have the her2+ gene? Is the size of what is left in the breast the determining factor or also what they removed from the biopsy. If it is then could I say I don't have idc? Ridiculous, both pathology reports need to be considered together to get a whole picture of what the dx is. Hopefully a good oncologist would consider both in finding the best treatment for you. Lastly, I would put on the brakes to any treatment until I knew for sure what my dx is, and risk factors for the treatment you will be taking. In some cases mx for early stage cancer is enough, especially when no nodes are involved. It might be over treatment for a questionable tiny tumor. If I am stage at stage 1, a mx is preventive enough for me...unless through tumor markers, and scans they can prove otherwise. Treatments can be brutal to your organs and in the end you may have worse problems ahead, especially when you didn't need such severe treatment. Just my opinion in all this. Be comfortable, and sleep well with what ever you the most peace.",

It's a hard choice when surgeons strongly suggest a blmx.  I've struggled with this decision the last few dx...and based on many of the risk assessment, I chose a lumpectomy. But, this time around, I knew that a lumpectomy for the right breast was not going to work. I am one of those who are high risk at least in the right breast. I had a PET scan a few weeks ago. Other than my right breast showing cancer the PET scan showed no activity in the left breast. Since the doctors consider me high risk for a recurrence and worse, I should had gotten a blmx ahile back. For me it's been really hard deciding between a blmx or uni. I've taken into consideration what Beesie has shared in previous posts...and Deirdre as well. I knew that once you took off your breast, A few days ago I went into the hospital not knowing I was getting a blmx or uni. When the surgeons cme by moments before taken to surgery, I shared with the surgeons that I didn't have peace about taking off the left breast. They then responded it was my decision. So, I ask them not take off the left breast. I am so very happy I made the decision to only remove one breast. I'm home tonight from the hospital and the whole right part of my chest hurts. I love it that I didn't do the left one right now...as I can sleep on my left side. I can lift my self from a seating because I pull up from the left side. I love it that so far I have one natural breast. If you are high risk, it might be wise to do a blmx. A lot of women tolerate it and some don't. For me just removing one was difficult...and knowing how I've responded now it was the right decision for me.",

At first I thought my ribs under my right breast, where I had the lumpectomy, was bruised from the surgery. It's been almost a month since surgery and it still feels brusied so I decided to take a closer look. Pulling my breast up high I see a cord running up into the breast, a blood vessel that leads from my ribs into the right breast.

I didn't read anywhere where it had anything to do with LE. That's a relief. Here's what I found out, Mondor's disease is an uncommon condition that occurs as a result of a blood clot in the superficial vein which goes away in about in 2 to 24 weeks. It can be caused by breast surgery, trauma, and other causes that wouldn't affect me.  It doesn't require treatment. Good news. ",

They saw too much bc and suffering. She said they love their new breast...that their new breast are better than what they had. She was trying to talk me into mx. I have had 2 lumpectomies in the same breast, and if it happens again, I will have a mx with reconsruction. However, I do appreciate what Deitre is saying. When I first heard that I had cancer, I thought wack them off. After a few days, I didn't want them off. It was all psychological. I couldn't put my finger on it. I don't like the idea of putting something foreign in my body. I like my breast...and for me, it has to do a little with my feminine side...not sure? If it happens that I have another recurrence, I will struggle, and feel like something about me is missing. I will need help.  Because I'm extremely high risk, I will be seen every three months for the first few years..and than six months. These dr appointments will help me not forget that I need to be proactive in staying healthy.  ",

The first surgeon said since I didn't want to take Tx that there was no need to see a oncologist. (I recently learned I can't take it anyway because I'm high risk for stroke...thyroid problem). Two different surgeons. I did have a rad/onc consult last year. He said since I had wide margins, only dcis and clear nodes that it was highly unlikely I would have a recurrence....although if I had rads my risk level would go down 5%. He said that most women want to throw everything at cancer, and the more assurance of lowering the risk, the better. The consult cost $1300. which was one of the three reasons I did not pursue it Dec 2007.  I did take a online high risk test last night for breast cancer. According to that test I was high risk. As much as I hate losting my natural breast...and it is smaller than the other one anyway...the answer for me, to reduce the risk, is to consider a mx. I probably should had a mx the last time. I would had lowered my risk a lot! I didn't realize at that time how haunting it would be to play the waiting game...for the ax to fall. B Barry",

I' see it differently in that we are not statistics. I don't consider myself a statistic. It is my opinion that we are all different...even our cancers. I see our cancer as different as our fingerprint. Cancers are different...one tumor can be mixed bag of tricks constantly changing...And, like largo said, it depends on a lot of factors other than the stage we are given at dx. To add to what she said, take in our over all general health,  and or do we have other health concerns such as diabetitis;  weight, do we smoke and or life style habits (such as inactivity)...The doctor needs to consider all these into our over all treatment rather than staging (and I'm sure most do) ... but what I hear...this is standard treatment for your stage. It is my opinion that statistics for a lot of cancers are based on stage rather than \"individualize\" treatment\".  At least this is what I've read or saw on a graph dealing with risks/staging. I think it would be better to have \"individualize\" dx taking in all the factors we mentioned. With that said, yes, there is a place for statistics...as Beesie is so good at pointing out generally overall statistics...but, it may not define our particuliar cancer or treatment. My favorite illustration, my previous dx stage 1a was idc mucinious cancer grade 1. Standard treatment surgery, tamoxifin & rads. My recent dx, stage 1a idc, grade 3, triple positive, larger tumor, and her2+++. Treatment, chemo, mx, tx, and herceptin. So stage 1a means nothing to me. If it had to do with defining my cancer by staging, I should not feel my recent cancer is that serious because after all the mucinious cancer I had rarely if ever mets... is the same stage as my now supposely aggressive stage 1a dx. Put my two idc cancers next to one another on a graph and see if the risk factors are the same. Case in point. Ok...now hopefully I'm done with my venting...guess you can tell this whole staging thing gets to me. (my venting goes toward early staging only). Largo...to comment...I'm in my mid 60's and my treatment protocol is the same as those who are 40's at least for my stage 1a. I know of an older bc women than I, who went through one chemo treatment after another....in her 70's, who has a very aggressive cancer. I read that older women don't have aggressive tumors... Most women are dx with bc in their 50's and up. It seems by these boards a lot of women are dx with aggressive cancers. I was said to have an aggressive tumor...a lot of recurrences in just a few years. This is why I don't like boxes :)",

I just wanted the sternum pain to stop hurting. I complained about it but since I was dx a few earlier with only stage 1a and had a mx they thought I was clear for a recurrence. The mammo last April showed a nodule that ended up being cancer. It did not look like previous cancers so I asked for a PET scan. The PET scan lit up like a Christmas tree. I had nodules all around the implant, numerous in the sternum (lungs, liver, bone, spine and brain). I went from stage 1a to stage iv in just a few years. I did have a bone scan done several months earlier and they checked the sternum and said it was arthritis. After MBC stage iv dx last June, I went to see my bone doctor. He said a woman with a history of breast cancer with sternum pain should have further test. He said it is rare to have pain in the sternum from arthritis. I said it is water under the bridge. He said, yeah, a lot of water under the bridge. He was angry I did not have further test in that the rad doctor took twice as long on the bone scans due to concerns. All the concerns were cancer.

I will see my breast surgeon 4 times this year, two times the next year, and the third and on ... only once a year. My surgeon said nothing about me being high risk. The surgeon hopes that she got all the cells. My first bc was the como type high grade/n ... The recent b.c. lumpectomy... the surgeon removed about quantrant of my breast.. The final pathology report was 100% multifocal... the como type, high grade/n with 1mm or 3 mm margins. But...the first lumpectomy, I had very wide clean margins. She said since she's watching me carefully and if it did occur again that it would be early and easily treatable. Before my first bc dx, I did not think I was at risk for bc. After the recurrence, I feel like I'm at greater risk. That's why I come to this particuliar thread. Don't know why...I'm here...maybe for support ... or hoping someone  will tell me I have nothing to worry about. The first time I shook it off easily...this time, I try...but there are times... I wonder if its still there. Not a good feeling. If it comes back, I'm mostly concerned about bc treatment...the time and how it affects my over all health.  I did not have radiation or tx. Like you, I chose to live with the risk. As I looked at the pro's and con's it seemed as if there were risks if I did treatment and if I didn't. I didn't want to lose my breast...but if I need to in the future I will. I would make that choice over rads.  I am being proactive in changing my eating habits, and hopefully getting overall healthy.  BUT there are days when I struggle with decisions I've made. Everyonce in a while I' look for reassurence that I'm doing the right thing. Deidre...I think...next week I have my 3 month appointment...and maybe mammo..not sure. I will never again feel comfortable getting a mammogram. When you begin to get used to life being normal ...  getting a mammo brings it all back. But in saying all this...I realize there are many other factors that make us high risk. I learned that I am high risk for other reasons...not because doctors said. Like taking hormones through menapause. If I knew about the risk of (horse) hormones, I might not had taken it, and had prevented these cancers....Thanks for listening to me ramble...B Barry ",

I wouldn't be surprised in a few years down the line the whole staging is replaced or refigured.  From what I've read the aggressiveness of the cancer depends more on the biology of the tumor than often the size or even nodes. Those who are stage 2, and have grade 1 in the nodes without the her2+++ factor prognosis is often more favorable than someone who is stage 1a who has the her2 positive and grade 3. The stage 1a with poor biology grade 3, with the her2+ might not be found in the node taken but I'm told that micromets are possible by blood or nodes not taken, which can show up a year later as mets. (this is why I had a mx and I'm doing herceptin).   I tell people I'm stage 1a, early cancer, and they say, it's a good cancer. Yet, I'm told to do the same treatment as if I was a more advance stage and that every unusal pain I notice will need to be scanned and etc...as said by my oncologist. Staging separates us into different catergories, (higher the stage or letter the worse the cancer) and in some cases, perhaps, and in some cases not necessarly, but as far as I'm concerned, simply, we're all staged cancer...doesn't matter what kind of cancer either.   I am most symphetic for those who are stage 0, because so many don't believe them to suffer as those who are stage 1 & up. The stage 0 lose their breast, lumpectomies, go through rads and are reminded every day when they take their tamoxifen for 5 years that they are fighting cancer...and it can come back. I hate it when people say even here, you are just early stage or stage 0. These women are going through so much for stage 0?  They are said to have the good cancer or in some cases they told that they only have pre-cancer. Sorry, I never liked the stage 0 ... Zero to me means nothing is going on. And this is what people think when they hear stage 0. To be stage 0 said to me, I really don't have real cancer, but for preventive, let's take off your breast, rads or tamoxifen for 5 years. I've had several doctors and all of them protocol to treatment had to do with staging...ALL OF THEM. Sounds as if this was not the case for some of you. Hopefully this is my last vent on staging. I do not mean to step on anyone toes...if so, my apologies. I was happy to find the article that somewhat supported my observations in regard to staging....only reason to bring this up again. I've always hated boxes and I suppose staging is doing just that and maybe this is another reason why I am reacting to the idea of fitting into a catergory or box :) And...to add, I don't need anyone to explain to me the staging differences...I' know what the different stages are for some time. That wasn't my problem. I wasn't going to post for a long time except on one her2+++ thread...but couldn't stop myself from getting this off my chest Hopefully this is end of my need to say more and leave the rest to you to drop it or continue the discussion. Thanks for letting me vent...the end",

My oncologist decided after 2 1/2 years of negative scans to do a PET scan. I figure it was good for peace of mind. We were both shocked that the stage 1a cancer has spread to my lungs, bones and a spot in my liver. My situation is complex and she suggest a second opinion at a bigger hospital, tumor board. At first she said too late to do anything about the tumors, breast and all because I had 6 months to live. This is a lot to hear when you thought you were only stage 1a. I thought about going to Bicher Clinic in California. They do hyperthermia heat to cancer spots. My oncologist said the one in the lungs are too deep. I am about to see a lung specialist. I said I didn't want to just leave the breast tumor and she said I could do a lumpectomy. This is a strange place to be.",

I got where I could only take 1 Tykerb a day and even that was too much. I was so sick on it. More MBC women live longer on Kadcyla and many do go into remission. It has been 2 years since dx with MBC. Because I had so much cancer throughout my body I wasn't given more than 6 months to live, and if that. I thought then if they weren't going to cure me, I for sure wasn't going to suffer with side effects from chemo. So...my oncologist suggested Herceptin/Perjeta weekly low dose because of previous heart problems taking Herceptin. Within a year there was a lot of progression of disease. Since I had multiple brain tumors, zapped by Gamma Knife, they really didn't think I would make it. However last Dec 23rd I had another 19 brain tumors zapped. They let me take Tykerb because it passed the BBB but like I said, I couldn't tolerate it so for awhile just on Herceptin. Because of progression in lungs, I was taken off of Tykerb and put on Kadcyla. My oncologist said Kadcyla had very little chemo and hidden in Herceptin so I shouldn't expect serious side effects. I was given it on a weekly low dose until last week when I had my first whole dose. They will try it again in three weeks to see if my heart can handle it. Due to radiation, other medication and now Kadcyla the neuropathy in my feet and fingers worsen to the point it is just about impossible to sleep. I wake up and my legs and feet are on fire!!! One reason I didn't want to do chemo was due to neuropathy pain. I wanted quality of life. I also am sometimes breathless, tired, and my nails are splitting. The good news is latest scans show no cancer in the liver, lymph nodes, hylar nodes and the 2 C breast tumor is gone!!! This is good news. If my brain stays cancer free as I've had 30 brain tumors zapped the past 2 years, I might too be soon in remission except for all the bone mets. I would be so happy. My oncologist did say if it stops working there are exciting new treatments coming up for Her2+ mbc. Anyone have treatment ideas for neuropathy pain? I got it from a completely different medicine...not chemo. So...you can't avoid all the side effects. Well, at least two years later I'm still her kicking.",

I have felt the lymph nodes burn and pressure for sometime, but thought it was heart burn or something else. I have another 2 C spot in the lung that lit up. I have multiple bone mets in shoulder blade, left ribs, spine, neck, hip and femur. I couldn't believe all the spots. Right now I have more questions than answers especially in regard to bone mets. I know a lot of the women here have far worse, and recovered. This is encouraging. At this point I can barely say, I'm stage IV.",

For example, last March with low grade 1, IDC mucinous, 1 C I was staged 1. It was a very slow and favorable type of cancer. The cancer I had last March rarely goes into the nodes or mets. This time, my bs stage me the same, except this time I'm IDC 2 C by 1.8 C grade 3 with the HER2+++(only surgical pathology). Both are stage 1a, but very different cancers. The lumpectomy alone with wide margins was enough for the grade 1 stage 1 cancer. But, the recent dx due to idc, grade 3 and the her2+++ factor \"standard care\" is chemo/herceptin/tamoxifen. Same grade 1a, but one is not so serious and the other one serious? The very first dx when I was told I was stage 0, I did not take it seriously because I was told they got it all and it was noninvasive. I was given the impression that the odds were I would not have a recurrence. The first thing my bc surgeon said the other day, good news it's only stage 1 and no mets. The mx got it all. This is what I want to hear...stage 1a and no need to worry about recurrence. I struggle with this because I am told the cancer I have isn't really that serious. It's good news I have stage 1 cancer. It's no different news than the last stage 1 cancer i had last March. I shouldn't worry, should I? I was also told by my oncologist that 75% of stage 1 after surgery will not have a recurrence. And, 10 of the 25% left even with treatment will have a recurrence anyway. Also, I told that 1% of those who have a mx will have a local recurrence. So, the odds are stage 1 with the mx I won't have a recurrence. Of course we both know that my luck hasn't been the best. It was a very difficult decision to do the mx, but I hoped it would be the treatment to finally rid me of recurrences. So yes, grade 1a gives me hope that I might not need to do more than surgery. And yes, I didn't take it seriously the first time around because it was grade 0. That first grade 0 because it was grade 3, and second time around multifocal grade 3 also grade 0 should be a higher grade than 0. I am now convinced that even DCIS higher grade and multifocal will recur if it's not all removed...just don't know when. And for me although margins seemed clean the first time around, they weren't. That's why rads and if you aren't comfortable with rads then mx is the best way to go. If I knew what I know now, the first time around with grade 3 I should have done the mx. My opinion, they should take more into consideration in staging as not to give false hope to women that have the HER2+++ and if its higher grade or multifocal by lumping them into a lower grade based on just being idc.",

The reason my bs wants do to a blmx is because I had a lumpectomy for idc on the left last March without rads or further treatment. But, the recent PET scan showed a clean left breast. I hate the idea of removing a breast that is now cancer free. The left breast cancer was stage 1, low grade. The cancer I have now is a recurrence of earlier cancers found in the right breast. The right breast also is idc along with high grade dcis cells. The idc has the her2+++ and high proliferation rate so the right one needs to go.  Because the right breast has now been dx 3 times there is no question about a mastectomy for that breast. The left breast is a different story...it never has had califications or signs of DCIS or aggressive type of cancers so I'm reluctant to remove it. If it is ever dx again there is no question then I will do a mx on the left as well. It would be nice to have one real breast...if possible. Kaara, I hope they don't lose my clothes. My daughter will probably keep them for me until surgery is over. I'm wearing black soft jamies (like workout pants) and a soft buttom down sweather to the hospital. I figure after I come home. I won't have to worry about changing before going to bed. Funny, the surgeon said I will be leaving the hospital about 9 P.M the second day. unless there are problems. I was told that I will shower the second day in the hospital. The nurse will show me what to do and etc. The rooms are all private like spa rooms with sofa's for your guest or over night visitors. The woman who referred me there said that they even feed the person staying with you. It's a very nice facility. They give just about everything you need including a softee cami. I will also be given a nausea patch. I guess thats why I won't need to bring but a few items??? Kaara, I'm not sure if I'll be hungry. When I've been on pain meds in the past, I' barely eat. I am not fond of hospital food. I always feel bad for people I visit in the hospital when I see what it is put before them. Mostly, I see myself sleeping the whole time I'm there. It doesn't take much to put me out. Because I have a pain syndrome, I will be put on pretty heavy pain meds to prevent the Chronic pain syndrome (rsd)  from going into the chest area. This is what the pain doctor and ps strongly suggested...keep me from experiencing any pain. I can just see myself leaving the hospital like someone who has had too much to drink  one more thing...the pain meds I picked up at the pharmacy are huge white horse pills. I don't see myself swallowing those pills. I have a hard time swallowing anything larger than a capsule. question...I roll from my side to my stomach when I'm asleep. If I'm on pain meds and don't feel pain, I see myself rolling onto my stomach. Has this happened to any of you. Is it hard on your stitches when you sleep on your tummy?  ",

Thanks ladies for all your kind words and encouragment. Tonight I have a knot in the pit of my stomach. Although I've read your amazing and brave stories, I'm still nervous. The three lumpectomies were so easy in that they didn't take my breast and the pain wasn't so bad. And, I'm still wrestling with doing a uni or biliaterial.  I'm comfortable doing one at a time. I can always do the other breast later. The idea of having one breast for awhile is awkward. It would be ok if I could wear a stuffed bra until the TE is the size of the other breast...especially at work. I know I shouldn't feel sad about losing a breast, but I do. It feels so unnatural and wrong...except for the good news in that I'll be cancer free tomorrow :) Other than feeling squeezy, I'm ready to go. I' finished my laundry, put it away, cleaned, and errands...except for the bank because they were closed today. Guess I'll know late tomorrow afternoon in recovery, Pacific Standard Time, if I will have a bi or uni mastectomy. ??? Praying for the others who also will be in surgery tomorrow...hope it goes well for all of you.",

I haven't yet spoken to my oncologist and for sure will discuss this with her. Someone said to me that the final pathlogy report said unless it is greater than 2 C it is stage 1a that is if there are no micromets or vasular invasion. For that reason I reasoned I'm stage 1a. The original biopsy took out 2C by 1.8 of idc with the her2+++ (and a small amount of high grade dcis) and left what they thought to be .5 C. The oncologist said something about vasuclar invasion in regard to the biopsy report...but the final pathology report showed no vasular invasion. But, the surgical mx showed the remainder of the tumor left was about the same as the biopsy...about 2 C by 1.8 x 1C ... something like that. So, I figured it's less than 2 C without mets which would put me in the 1a catergory. It was noted that it was a palitable mass. If you put the two together than the tumor would be almost 4 C making me a stage 2. My bs surgeon only considered the final pathology report in determining my prognosis. So can I say more? In March my idc, mucious grade 1 cancer was also dx as idc stage 1. But, the recent cancer also written up as stage 1 is a more serious cancer in that it is grade 3, idc, with the her2+++ and larger tumor...yet both are stage 1a. I am ok with it being stage 1a in that the prognosis is good either way.  If it's not perhaps they should change how they dx the final pathology or maybe the surgeon should leave the dx to the oncologist who considers the biopsy along with the surgical biopsy ... because mine was the same tumor.",

It seems as if the breast surgeons consider the staging by the last path report only...perhaps the oncologist consider both...especially since mine came from the same tumor.

Right now, I'm going to try to just focus on the right breast healing. I am in a lot of pain! The reason again that the surgeons want to do the left breast is because idc, less aggressive cancer was found in the left breast last Christmas although the lumpectomy wasn't until March, 2011. Since I didn't do rads or tamoxifen they suggest for standard treatment mastectomy. My thinking is the PET scan didn't show activity in the left breast makes me feel that for now it's a good clean breast...so why remove something that's not broken?",

I'm just beginning to feel like I'm turning the corner. I might take a walk today and since it's rainy I'll go to the mall. I need to begin building up my endurance. I've been lying on the sofa since surgery. I'm not sleeping in my bed because I fear rolling over onto my tummy. I run a school. I have about 29 employees so I'm not worried about being fired. I usually teach 14 classes, but this month only 10. I am going to try to go in for two days each week. I think I can do at least that. We have a big exhibit and revue coming up. So much has depended on me. I miss being at work. The families have been so supportive in bringing food and etc. I can't even imagine being out a month. We begin a new term in February so alot is happening right now in finishing up the winter term. If I knew a mastectomy would had taken this long to recover I would have opted for a large lumpectomy and do a mx next summer. I should had read more before going into surgery the past surgery post :) Also...my ps is a little different than most. He did the botox on the pec muscles putting in 300 ccs at surgery...so I was pretty filled when I woke up from surgery. When I heal in 6 weeks he will do the second surgery taking out the TE replacing it with the implant. He wants to do this before the botox wears off. Within three months I should be completely finished. The reason I chose the ps I did is because he uses botox and with rsd I needed the nerves paralized to prevent a rsd recurrence. The pain I've been having is mostly from the TE'S. I also read before surgery there would be no feeling on the chest area??? There is feeling on the skin.",

My underarm is actually feeling better today. I do have web cording of three long strands at the surgical node site to the elbow. At first it was one, then two, and this morning I notice another one beginning. Kira has excellent website explaining cording...web cording. I am hoping with early intervention that it will resolve before becoming something like lymphdema. I've learned a lot here since my surgery a few weeks ago that enlightens me to know what to do right now...prevention is key. Monitors...I had that four years ago when I had the right nodes removed. It seemed like a large vein that ran through the breast to the top part of my stomach...it was weird. After one pt appointment and  exercises in a matter of a few weeks or so it disappeared. The cording seems to be worse in that it is hard to lift my arm. I hope your insurance works out. If you go to the hospital, usually they will work with you. It is important to take care of this before it becomes lymphdema. One thing I learned here is ... not to be tough and over use your affected arm. Not worth it.",

Yet this approach, using the stages to determine therapy, could mean that some patients were being denied an effective therapy they needed, while others were beingtreated unnecessarily. Burke says that this is impossible because you would end up with hundreds, if not thousands, of different categories that cross over each other, thus defeating the main purpose of TNM - that it is a simple, easy to understand and use, outcome system. However, Burke feels that the real issue with the use of TNM is what he calls \"biological determinism\". \"The essential question is: are we going to continue to treat our patients based on an anatomic extent-of-disease approach, or are we going to use what we have learned about the biology of the cancer to defeat the tumour that is growing in the patient?\" Seconding Burke at the EBCC Jean Perrin, Clermont-Ferrand, France. She highlighted the irrelevance of TNM in breast cancer compared with the far more relevant information that is now known about the role of oestrogen and progesterone positive and negative markers (ER and PR), and HER2 status. \"We need prognostic and predictive intrinsic tumour parameters of response to treatment that can be obtained by understanding the tumour biology. These are not in theTNM!\" she said. Opponents argue that information on molecular biology, such as HER2 status as revealed by the FISH test (right), should be at the heart of any modern staging system...",

I can have it removed in a year if I like. This way I'm in surgery 2 hours instead of 4 hours. Recovery is half the time. Plus, I have natural feeling in one breast. I feel the most peace about only removing 1...hope it happens. My breast will most likely look a bit different. I heard that even reconstructed breast differ. I will hopefully be able to sleep on the left side, and find recovery easier. So, I do it twice...at least it won't be as drastic or overwhelming. I suppose what's important is what gives you the most peace? If it's uni, then go for it. If it's bilaterial then do that.",

Those who have micro-mets to invasive fall under the stage 1a that is if you are node free. I have been told that staging is for treatment. But, I learned that some stage 1a requires chemo and others do not. Some are treated more like DCIS. There are those who are stage 2a that are similiar treated to those of stage 1. For our sakes, I do think early staging needs to be redone. I feel that way for stage 0 as well. Those who are given stage 0 or stage 1a assume that they have the good cancers, easily treatable. In staging they don't include the her2+ factor. Although Beesie has done a great job in explaining this on other threads, I feel there needs to be a thread where we can discuss early stage staging...why, what and etc especially in regard to treatment differences for the same staging. Early staging can give false hope that you are cancer free and early staging risk factors differ for stage 0 through stage 2.

My surgery isn't until the end of the month, Dec 27th.  I can enjoy Christmas without possible pain problems or being doped up on pain meds :) BUT...I get the results back of the scans done this month on December 19th. A great Christmas gift is the scans come out clear, no cancer. I have a pet scan Wednesday and a brain mri next Wednesday. Preparation to do list for surgery...from what I've been told the hospital gives you just about all you need except for the clothes you wear home. I did buy myself 2 nice robes, 2 buttom up pj's and comfy socks....mostly to baby myself when I get home :) The only other preparation I'm doing is a little Spring cleaning, Christmas and perhaps a few meals in the freezer. New Years Eve I'm having young adults over for a game night. Hopefully, I'll be back to somewhat normal by then. I'm so glad my surgery is during Christmas vacation...don't have to miss work :)",

I wasn't for sure if I would come out with one breast gone or blmx. About an hour before surgery, the surgeon came by. I said, I didn't have peace about taking off the left breast. The bc surgeon said before surgery the debate was over, and what I wanted she would do it. The plastic surgeon then came in and I said the same to him. He shook his head and said both had to go. I brought up the RSD pain syndrom (from a broken wrist). He knows all about rsd, so he said, ok, I'll do one now, and the other when it heals. I said, what if I want to keep the one that's clean of cancer cells. He then said he wouldn't give me my implants until I did a mastectomy on the left. I wasn't about to argue at that point knowing I was about to go to surgery. There is a time to speak up and a time to shutup :) Due to the rsd syndrome I was on IV antibiotics and IV for pain meds for about 48 hours...so I stayed in the hospital a little over 2 days (2 nights, 2 days and a half).  I also took meds in pill forms for pain, vitamins and for whatever. I was popping pills right and left. The food was delicious...got to order my own meal plan...no gluten. The private rooms with their own shower and etc...very nice set up. My daughter said it felt more like being a hotel.The nurses were sweet and so helpful. The nurse gave me a shower yesterday. They put something over (mesh?). The biggest problem I had was feeling dizzy when sitting up or walking. It was probably due to all the pain meds. The other was or is my skin  turned yellow, and today it's orange. I look like I have a recent sun tan. Can't complain about that except I wonder if the orange/yellow skin is due to toxicity of the liver. Tomorrow morning I have my first post-op with the plastic surgeon. Next week I will have my second post op and also with the beast surgeon. So far the four nodes that was removed showed no cancer. Good news...I won't know more until the pathology reports comes back sometime next week. I'll probably know when I meet with the breast surgeon next week. I havern't read some of the recent surgeries, and how those girls are doing. I hope it went well for them.",

I almost past out a few times this morning. I feel like I've been run over by a truck. I am surprised in with botox there shouldn't be that much pain. I do have a wedge pillow that the previous hospital gave all breast cancer patients. I could use another one :) I haven't put the cami on they gave me, just the pink wrap. It works well for a bra. I bought the geni bras and 1 Awe bra. I threw a lot of bra's away. The geni bra and unltr bra work so well...and not knowing my final outcome, I thought the geni bra is what I'll wear when I can wear a bra again. I only have 1 drain on the right side under the arm pit. It hasn't bothered me. My daughter drains it for me.So...far all is well. Little timid about seeing the ps this afternoon. He is very insistent about taking off the other breast. I'm not in the mood to fight or argue about anything right now. Since one mastectomy was so hard on me, again, I'm glad I only did one. Having the left side of me helps a lot. At least I can pull myself up from the left side. . I have altogether 3 post op appointments, next Monday a threpist, then a ct scan of the brain and an oncologist appointment around January 16th. My surgeon said we won't know the results from the surgery until mid-next week when I meet with her. She thinks it's large that the .5 C left over from the lumpectomy. Once I hear the news from that pathology report, I will hopefully feel this ordeal is over. Just praying I don't get an infection as they will have to take out the TE's and let my breast heal before reconstruction. Right now the right breast is very swollen, bruised and hot to the touch.",

My chest area is bright red, and belly is swollen, and lumpy. My skin is still orangy/yellow. He felt the reaction was the pink wrap. He said to put a t-shirt under the wrap, but I should still wear the tight wrap around the breast chest area. I thought the problem was the pain meds or antibiotics. What I did was take a prescription to Norstrom and picked up 2 mastectomy bras. I only wanted one but they said my insurance will pay for two. I lost the one they gave me at the hospital. The ones I have now are supposely a upgrade. They are very comfortable and nice. I can slip in a nice soft breast insert. I like the idea of the pocket for the drain. The rash seems a little better this morning, but the itch is annoying. Again, I think the problem is the meds...not the wrap. I'm going to continue talking the pain meds until the pain level goes down to about a 3. It does make me feel a little loopy, fuzzy brain, and dizzy. In a few days this too shall pass.",

One young nine year old boy said, when did you break your arm? I smiled and said, I don' have a broken arm just a wound. He was ok with that :) I did have to take breaks, but noticed mid day that the drain had increased. I went home a little early and slept for three hours. I didn't feel like I did that much to tire me out like it did. Tomorrow, I am going to try to do a half day...just depends. I also have another appointment tomorrow morning with my plastic surgeon...hopefully to take out the drain. I was estatic last night when it was down to 25cc. I am fearful due to being out today it might be more and it won't be out until next week. It is getting less than 40ccs a day. Blessings, I also have the genie bra and the ultra bra. Geni bra is superior. Right now, I'm wearing the mastectomy bra that zips up in front with the tight binder over that the ps insist I wear 24/7. I'm looking forward to wearing the genie bra. I feel like I'm wearing a straight jacket :( I also slept in my own bed the last few nights. I forgot how comfortable my own bed is...It's better than the sofa where I've been propped up all night.

I had Montors the first time around, and simple massage took care of it. The webbing was worse. The PT showed me how to redirect the lymph system downward toward the stomach.

I have scar tissue that limits range of motion so says doctors. I had 2 frozen shoulders on the left. I have been told that I have a tendency toward frozen shoulders and imflamatory pain problems. My pt today saw my lost of range of motion even on my good side (non mx side). It doesn't keep me from doing what I need to do. But, when you are in the acute stage of it, yes...it hurts likes crazy. It's taken about 2 yrs for each shoulder to completely recover. I've learned that swimming is preventive. Don't let it get stiff or try to be brave about pain. The frozen shoulder pain can stop you in your tracks. The only thing you may not completely recover is the complete range of motion. PT and chiorpractor care is a must for about 3 to 6 months...at first it was twice a week. Also chortizone shots. BTW...my pt said today that they don't completely know what causes frozen shoulders. She did say that some say it's inflamatory in the joints. Another doctor said those who have longer legiments (sp for sure) tend to have probelms with it more than others. It is usually caused by an injury...sorta like rsd. Who knows?",

I do recall horrible pain while in recovery. There was a nurse sitting by me the whole time. I was given pretty heavy narcotics. I was on pain drugs the whole time while at the hospital by IV and pill from. I felt a little drunk, hard to walk. After getting home yesterday around 4 something (afternoon), I felt ok...after dinner fell asleep. I'm in a little pain now but trying not to take pain drugs. My brain gets a little loopy on drugs...need my brain to go into work today. So...in a week or so I should know more about the implant. Right now it's the drain from under my arm that hurts.

My insurence wouldn't cover it so they are contacting the surgeon to see if they will talk to my insurance company. The Percocet (pain meds) are large white horse pills. There is no way I can swallow them. I prefer capsules that slip down the throat easily. The main reason for me to take pain meds is due to my previous and chronic RSD condition. It's a pain symdrome. It happen as as result of a broken wrist several years back. The surgeons then said to avoid surgery at all costs, which I can't...so I am vulnerable to nerve pain problems. I have to prevent pain at all cost. But, the plastic surgeon gives Percocet to all his mastectomy patients. The lumpectomies I didn't need more than one pain pill before and after surgery. Although, I still have nerve pain along my lumpectomies scars. I am a little concerned about the antibiotic. I have to take it 5 days post surgery coming home from the hospital. I've had issues with candida problems the last few years from antibiotic treatments..oral thrust. I'm so afraid of another outbreak.",

I forgot who had a uni masectomy and was home within hours. Did you have reconstruction as well? I heard all mastectomies were overnight? I might get a uni-mx that is if I have my way. I figure if I just have the cancer infected side done recovery will be faster. My bs is set on the doing a blmx. I signed off for a blmx on the consent form, but the bs said I can still change my mind. So...the morning I go into surgery I won't know if I'll come back with one breast or just two bumps. I am going to write on my left good breast ... please...don't take me. I am good.",

When I'm awake, I'm miserable. I don't know how you ladies do it. I am soooo glad I only had one breast removed. It was nice to wake up with some assemblence of a breast. Because my ps used botox he was able to put in 300 saline cc ... not sure I got it right. He put in 60 cc today and 40 next week. I'll be totally filled by next week and in six weeks I'll have the new impant. I'm not sure how I feel about all this. I've real mixed feelings about the implant. In the future I can see myself removing the implant for complete fat grafting. Well...I also met with my bs today. Final results. These results are not based on the previous biopsy report as its from a different lab. The biopsy report from Oct. 4th...1.7 to 2 C of idc HER2+++ with some high grade dcis.  The surgical report is invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 3, Her2 positive, nottingham score 8 of 9, forming a 1.8 x 1.8 x 1.0 CM  also found dcis high grade como necrosis 10% of mass (this is about all I understood of 5 pages).  I am tempted to ask my surgeon to send my tissue samples to legacy who have done past reports. At least they are easier to understand. If you put the biopsy and surgical report together then the size would be greater than 2 C, but if it depends only on the last surgical pathology report then I am a grade 1 a.  Confusing ??? I'll meet with my oncologist mid January. Hopefully she will explain more fully this very confusing report.   Right now, I can't even think past this mastectomy...the idea of doing or taking anything making me feeling sick is out of the question. I just want to feel normal right now.",

I didn't read it. It seems that if there is no evidence of vasular invasion or node involvement then the mx is treatment enough for stage 1 cancer. How do you determine if you are stage 1a or stage 1b? I figured I'm stage 1a in that there is no node involvement or vasular evidence. Mid January I'll meet with my oncologist who will explain my pathology report as it is difficult to understand it all. I am happy that the cancer didn't spread outside the breast area.  ",

It was fear of the pain possible PMPS that pushed me to then get a lumpectomy rather than a mx. Here I am again with a similiar dilema except this time it's deciding on a uni- or bilateral mx. I have no choice this time. The R breast hast to go...especially after 3 now dx. Because I've been dx with RSD or chronic pain syndrome in my right hand, I'm at higher risk for symphetic pain syndrome. I've also been dx with 4 to 5 frozen shoulders. After both sentinal node dissections I'd had either web cording and montors syndrome. The pain doctor (anesthelogist) said that I had a symphetic nervous disorder...although now I'm not sure they consider it a disorder? Although when I feel pain on one side of my body, I also feel in on the other. Even now when my lumpectomy scar on the right side burns, I feel it in the same location on the left breast. My lumpectomies scars hurt, surges of pain and burns to this day...not horrible...but it does. All to say one of the reasons I'm anxious about a mastectomy, especially a blmx is being dx with PMPS. It seems as if it can happen it will happen to me. I wanted to do the fat grapting but the only one that seems to do the whole breast is Miami. Going to Miami is not an option for me. I've contacted a plastic surgeon who does fat grafting, but he only does it for lumpectomies...He has never done a whole breast. I had hoped the fat grafting would be less painful than TE & implants. So...someone called me to see Dr. Gabreil who uses botox to ellievate the pain problem. I was ready to go with another plastic surgeon and bc surgeon. Because of the botox possibly being an answer to a possible pain problem, I changed surgeons. I spoke with a lady who had the procedure done, blmx with the botox. She had the TE and in 6 weeks the exchange implant. She said she had no problems with pain in her arms or chest area. The whole ordeal was pretty easy. I'm hoping the botox is the answer for me. This team of doctors in Vancouver Washington are the only ones doing the botox. The botox is still under a atrial study. I feel so fortunate to be so close to where this doctor is and to have something that addresses the pain problem. I spoke with this lady again tonight. I was wondering, due to pain and recovery time, if to just do the uni. She put my spirit at rest and I may just go ahead and do the blmx. She said after the study that more and more women will have the advantage of botox, which may very well solve our pain problems.",

I wanted to do the fat graftng hoping it would be the easiest and less painful type of reconstruction, but no one in my area does a full fg...at least no one that I know of. I then heard of a plastic surgeon who uses botox on the pec muscles making the implant, TE's less painful. He also prescribes muscles relaxants and pain meds. While in the hospital for almost 3 days, I was on constant IV for pain meds and of course antibiotics. Even with all that and two weeks of living on strong pain meds, I felt nerve pain. I am sure it would had been a lot worse if I didn't have the plastic surgeon I had. Right now, I'm weaning myself off all pain meds. Last night was the first night I didn't need pain meds. I will have a second surgery for the implants. I am sure if I need pain meds, the ps will make sure I have what I need. And finally, the last surgery is fat grafting over the small implant. This is suppose to give me a natural look and normal breast feeling. I'm so glad to have found a surgeon who is very aware of RSD and PMPS. He also sends all his mastectomy patients to a physical therapist.",

Tonight I put it in the wash and laid down only with a soft cami. I began having pain so I put on a mastectomy bra which is also slightly tight. I hate it and I love it. I'm getting used to wearing in 24/7. I don't have swelling or pain when wearing the wrap. And as I said, I easily sleep on my side without pain...and few times I rolled on my tummy and with the wrap it didn't really hurt too much...after a few minutes after rolling back to my side the minor pain was gone. My p.s. also used botox which also eliminates chest spasm. My p.s knows alot about pmps so he does everything to eliminate pain. He is also a master in reconstruction. I don't like the process, but I know with my pain syndrome problem I would be in such pain that the TE's would be out by now if I was not under his care. He takes very good care of his ladies...he says. His bc patients I heard in the hospital are given the best care. They are given special milkshakes with all kinds of vitamins, a soft cami, the wrap, and he'll keep you in the hospital until he knows your pain is under control and fluid from the drain. I stayed an extra day over a minor concern...not my choice. So make sure you are under the best plastic surgeon...although it does frustrate me he wants to take off the other breast. I'm not going through this again if I don't need to.",

I have been dx for the third time with bc. This time it is in the good breast. I don't know much about this cancer except that it does have an invasive component and is a small tumor. Will know more when I see the surgeon on Wednesday. My concern with getting a lumpectomy, and for sure a mx is the pain issue. I already have intense burning pain in the former lumpectomies scar tissue. I also have RSD in my right hand and wrist. For those who don't know, RSD is Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (RSD)/Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS). It sounds similar to the PMPS. I've have had about 4 or 5 frozen shoulders. I was told by my doctors (ortho, therapist, and pain specialist doctors) that if possible to avoid all surgery and or falls. One went onto say I should live in a rubber room and I was to stay away from needles. I have a sympathetic nerve problem. For example, once when getting a frozen shoulder in one shoulder, it then went for no reason to the other shoulder. For this reason, I'm at high risk for the Post Mastectomy Pain Syndrome. Or, if it's RSD AGAIN, It could cause the RSD to spread to the whole chest area. I'm not sure of the difference between PMPS and RSD. I know that RSD spreads. I think I'm in the third stage of the RSD syndrome. With RSD, you feel tingling burning, numbness, and at time you feel like your infected area is on fire. It also locks up your joints. I can't imagine my whole chest area being on fire. I feel like I'm in a real pickle. There is a part of me that would like to just get rid of my breast and move on. I would have a really hard time adjusting without breast. I would like a reconstructed breast. Just don't want to deal with this forever. I have to make the decision on a lumpectomy or mx in a few days. Any words of encouragement or enlightenment would be very much appreciated. Thanks :)",

So far there's been no problems with the women in this study. I've read the fat grafting thread and someone from there gave me a couple of names. I've contacted the one in my area and he's never done a whole breast...only with implants and lumpectomies. If it turns out that the TE's are painful, I will have them removed. The ps said because of little pain he is able to put the implants in sooner. I hate the idea of implants. This whole process is bothersome, but I have to do it.",

They knowing my history of RSD (pain syndrome) realize that rads is out of the question. Also Hashi's thyroid (autoimmune) is another reason they would not give me rads. They highly suggest a double mx. My breast surgeon said that her rsd patients have less of a problem with mx over lumpectomies. She seem to lean toward a mx without reconstruction. I strongly disagreed. She said if I did a nipple sparing mx that I would not keep my nipple. Done! That was it....I don't think I'm going to do anything at all. Right now...I'm not a happy camper.",

My hand and arm literally was on fire. The air hurt it. No one could get near me without being on severe nerve pain meds. I felt it spreading to my other arm and hand and into my right leg. I was scared out of my wits. I had nerve blocks, and physical therapy that did help a lot. My right hand, I'm right handed, was swollen shiny purple, and I couldn't bend a few fingers. My hand was locked. I'm a artist. So, I was told by the doctors and therapist treating me at that time to avoid anything that would cause nerve problems, surgery, or falls. I am at high risk for PMPS. Even right now a three wks post surgery I feel my right arm burning, burning under my arm pit and pain around the chest area...not that severe due to botox and taking pain meds. I don't want to go there again. It is horrible and for me when going through the acute part of the pain, you aren't sure if you want to live. What helped me more than anything was swimming. For the first few years after dx I swam almost everyday. I would go into the hot tub to the pool cooler water, although our pool was somewhat heated. I put my hand under the warm jets for a few minutes every five minutes. I walked. I kept my mind busy with other things. After awhile I didn't need pain meds. I've learned to live with a mild burning pain in my right hand, and keep my fingers moving so they don't lock. It took me about two years before I got back to somewhat of a normal life. I also learned that stress aggreviates the pain problem. I am learning to just let things go or walk away from stressful situations. It's not worth it. I'm no longer on pain meds...except for the recent mx. One of the main reasons for deciding on a uni other than a blmx was due to being high risk for PMPS. The less surgery the better for me. The rsd dx has a huge impact on my decision making in my cancer treatment. I have seen people who are curled up in pain, lose limbs, and etc due to this pain problem. For me this is worse than another cancer dx. It is hell having your body feel likes it on fire.",

It occurred to me that the few years before my 2007 and 2008 bc dx I was under a lot of stress...self employed. My second dx was a wakeup call. Besides adding vitamins, thyroid meds, and iodine, I am doing trying not to let things get to me, or stress me out. And when you are dx with cancer, you not only battle with the disease, but with financial stress in paying medical bills. It can be a catch 22 situation. This last year has been busy, and demanding, but I'm not letting responsibility or the demands of everyday life get to me. I am convinced that stress is huge in destroying our bodies, and puts us at risk for b c and other diseases. I came across information that support these thoughts...thinking it might help others, I'm putting this information out there in hopes it helps others to find rest in the middle of the storm.                                                                 ........... Sept. 24, 2003 (Copenhagen, Denmark) -- As if life isn't stressful enough, Swedish researchers say that being under stress maydouble a woman's risk of developing breast cancer. They based their findings on surveys of more than 1,400 Swedish women in the late 1960s who were part of a long-term health-care study. They found that women who reported being under stress had twice the risk of developing breast cancer as women who managed to stay cool, calm, and collected. Another report... Hundreds of studies have measured how stress impacts our immune systems and fights disease. At Ohio State University, researcher Dr. Ron Glaser, Ph.D., found that students under pressure had slower-healing wounds and took longer to produce immune system cells that kill invading organisms. Renowned researcher Dr. Dean Ornish, M.D., who has spent 20 years examining the effects of stress on the body, found that stress-reduction techniques could actually help reverse heart disease. And Dr. Barry Spiegel, M.D., a leader in the field of psychosomatic medicine, found that metastatic breast cancer patients lived longer when they participated in support groups. Other studies have gone as far as to show those women who experienced traumatic life events or losses in previous years had significantly higher rates of breast cancer. Still, the National Cancer Institute reports, \"Although studies have shown that stress factors, such as death of a spouse, social isolation, and medical school examinations, alter the way the immune system functions, they have not provided scientific evidence of a direct cause-and-effect relationship between these immune system changes and the development of cancer.\" Nonetheless, some medical experts say therein lies the link between cancer and stress - if stress decreases the body's ability to fight disease, it loses the ability to kill cancer cells. Every day, our bodies are exposed to cancer-causing agents in the air, food and water we're exposed to. Typically, our immune system recognizes those abnormal cells and kills them before they produce a tumor. There are three important things that can happen to prevent cancer from developing - the immune system can prevent the agents from invading in the first place, DNA can repair the abnormal cells or killer T-cells can kill off cancer cells. Research has shown that stress can lower the body's ability to do each of those things, according to Dr. Lorenzo Cohen, Ph.D., assistant professor of behavioral sciences at the University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. Does that mean there's a direct link between stress and the risk of developing cancer? Not necessarily, Cohen said.

What you've gone through is hard, and very stressful. There are stresses you can't escape, such as a special needs child. Just getting their needs met is sometimes like trying to break through impossible walls. You feel like you are always fighting for them. We took a special needs child in for several years. I know a little of what stresses come with those kinds of needs. Your statement  that your cancer would be more severe than dcis if stress was a factor? Uhmmm...dcis is cancer. It begins there. You were forunate to find it before it became invasive. It takes time for dcis to grow.   We live in a very stressful world. There are those who handle stress better than others. It is my opinion that those of us who have been dx with breast cancer need to find ways to eradicate as much stress as we can from our lives. I say this in full realization that there are somethings we have no control of. For me right now  ... it's letting go of things I can't do anything about. It's not worrying about how I am going to pay all my medical bills. I still haven't paid all the medical bills from a year ago. It's forgetting yesterday, and living for today. I want to get rid of what stresses me out so I don't have another recurrence of breast cancer.",

I've learn to deal with it so it's not much of a problem But with my upcoming mx and reconstruction surgery, where I will be given implants, I am very concerned about pain in the chest area. The pain specialist said I have a very sensitive nervous system making me vulnerable to chronic pain problems. So...today, I saw a different plastic surgeon who injects his patients with botox in the pec muscles. I spoke with one woman, a patient of Dr. Gabrel, who said after the first week tylenol was enough. She was driving and doing everything she usually does the second week after surgery. This is why I'm choosing him...hoping that I won't have that much pain. I wanted to do the fat grafting but no one does whole breast fat grafting from this area. If the TE's or implants don't work, or causes pain problems, I'll remove them and I guess find someone who can do fat grafting. My prevous pain docs said avoid surgery at all cost. Can't avoid it when you have cancer.",

He said my RSD and surgery puts me slightly at highter risk for it to occur elsewhere in my body.  But the fact, I have managed pain without med's and have overcome the acute pain of RSD makes my situation more favorable. He also said that pain due to breast cancer is usually PMPS (Post Mx Pain Symdrone). However, he nor the surgeon want to take chances. They want to do a pain block before surgery, and pain med's 3 days before surgery....and 2 weeks afterwards. Oh...two different kinds of pain med's...strong stuff. Geee...I could get addicted. He gave me one prescription today. I can't see myself drugged up for that length of time. The most interesting part of the conversation is tricking the brain in becoming pain free. My therapist years back, when I first injured my wrist/hand, said the same thing. The mind believes that we are in pain, and if you can somehow trick the brain then the pain will go away. The doctor said, they do it through a box of mirrors.  My therapist had me put my hand in cool water than warm water...back and forth several times. She said this also tricked the brain. All I know is it helped. I know keeping my mind focused on other things relieves the pain. Also, avoiding stress...which he said was a must. To add...the Pain Specialist today also said the fact I'm fearful of the surgery puts me at higher risk for a pain problem. I've got to get over being afraid of another surgery.",
