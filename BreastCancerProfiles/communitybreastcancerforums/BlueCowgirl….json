For those of you waiting on your surgery, I hope I can make you feel a little better by saying it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought!

I mean, really? I could picture where it was, what it was, how it functions, but not the name. I was driving and I cried all the way home wondering if I could ever be normal again and what would happen if a student asked me a basic question and I couldn't answer it.

Then, a few weeks later, after they felt better, during Taxol the same area turned red and then started peeling like crazy. By the way, my first oncologist (I switched partway thru chemo) said \"not hand-foot syndrome\" when I saw her with just the heel pain, no visible signs. She basically said it was all in my head. I wanted to go back later on and show her my red peeling feet and tell her off... The sad thing is, I think these chemo drugs we are given are so powerful that there are countless possible side effects, then add supplements, diets, etc to it and it's next to impossible for the doctors to figure out exactly \"what\" or \"why\" when a certain symptom springs up. We just have to hope they recommend something that will make it feel better. Hope yours feels better soon! ",

      "Content": "Dec 13, 2011 01:52AM - edited Dec 13, 2011 01:57AM by BlueCowgirl Hello Giant Tumor Sisters! Mine had strange dimensions, they initially called it two masses but turned out they were connected. Something like 7cm total length, wide at each end with skinny area connecting...I picture the shape looking like a barbell. Mine was both ductal and lobular, and some previously undetected cribiform and DCIS was found in post-surgical pathology. I had neoadjuvent chemo, dose dense ACx4, Taxolx4. Shrank tumor a lot. I have to say, it was really cool feeling my tumor shrink during chemo and what kept me motivated to keep going through some really rough SEs. BS pushed me for trying lumpectomy, bad margins so got unilateral mastectomy in the end anyhow. (still part of me wishing I got BMX...still considering it). Still had 3 positive lymph nodes at surgery, but my doctors didn't think that was surprising with ER/PR+ HER2- status.  Got very aggressive rads -  chest wall, axilla, supraclavical nodes, another I can't recall name (chemo brain still!). Just started Tamox this week. PET I had before rads showed a few hotspots but RO believes they are false positives and was comfortable starting rads before additional diagnostics. Now that I am \"healed\" from rads to my RO's satisfaction, I am about to begin series of tests to confirm that my PET hotspots are not mets: lung CT, endoscopy, colonoscopy, whatever they call the -oscopy up your nose. Noseoscopy? Up your nose with a rubber hose? Whatever. Hope to gain more insights from this thread, thanks so much for starting J-Bug, and hoping with all my heart for clean scans so I don't break this thread's No Stage IV status ;) And best wishes for your hip J-Bug.",

It started along my mastectomy scar, and is now throughout my underarm as well. I'm already finished with radiation - I actually just had lots of fatigue, redness and soreness during treatment...which has progressed to exhaustion and the blistering oozing deal just over the past few days.  My doctor prescribed me Silver Sulfadiazine (Thermazine) cream which I know from previous experience has worked wonders on my horses, but it hasn't been giving me much relief. I will ask him about the cool gel pads...Already have enough narcotics to last a lot longer than this will, I think. So sorry so many of you have gone through the same SEs and worse...wouldn't wish this on anyone! ",

I am wondering though if the headache is still around, and if so, if you have had any repeat MRI since the first hospital visit? Only because the headache/abdominal pain/diarrhea/etc sounds suspiciously like what my best friend just went through that turned out to be ADEM (google it for tons of info). It took 3 weeks of hospitalization, 3 different hospitals, and numerous lumbar punctures to finally diagnose...but most of all, a repeat MRI about 2 months after the illness began, as nothing abnormal showed up on her initial ones. Having gone through this journey with her, I believe that ADEM is much more common than reported, as it's difficult to diagnose. That said, your breast may be an entirely separate issue. Nodule doesn't necessarily mean cancer...a biopsy would determine whether it's malignant or benign.  But the headache? I may be totally off-base here, but the story sounds so familiar, I would find a good neurologist and ask about ADEM - it is very treatable, but can worsen without treatment.  I wish the best for you and hope you find answers to all your questions soon...And a return to good health. ",

I will be there. No, really. Don't care for bicycles, never tried a motorcycle, unless I win the lottery, not sure how I will get there, but...I *WILL*. I could always start early and ride in on a horse, slouching in the saddle, naturally. But if I *do* win the lottery, I will be showing up in a vintage Porsche 911 targa convertible.  FWIW, I don't run unless I'm being chased. I am thinking of working out and losing some lbs after my DIEP, but I need to maintain enough bellyfat for a D-cup, and since I am thinking of having my remaining breast removed at the same time, I am thinking maybe putting on some more pounds so I can have two big ones, maybe enough for DD's, is a good idea. So obviously working out is absolutely out of the question at the moment. And also I am resolving to help ensure the success of my DIEP with lots of beer and lots of greasy bacon and some chocolate cake for me while I am slouching. And whole milk, and more beer.  I am certainly glad to hear about the new alcohol study, which simply proves what many of us have believed for so long. Now we need further studies about the risks of exercise. Please? They must be out there...And I now know where to find BC women willing to participate in this type of study....",

Yes, staging can be complicated with Neoadjuvent, which a lot of women on this thread had....So you are not certainly not alone in not knowing. I too wonder if I had complete lymph node invasion before chemo or just the ones they found in surgery. Who knows? I did have a sentinal node biopsy at the time of my breast biopsies, so it is only based on this that I was labeled Stage IIIa due to size of tumor, the fact that it spanned multiple quadrants, and I had lymph node invasion. I think a lot of the staging you see above for the neoadjuvent women is just an educated guess. So...I know I was at least IIIa - which I much prefer to any higher stage I might have actually been at diagnosis, so that is why I put IIIa on my sig line. Clear as mud? ",

I don't know if I can find it, but I do remember that I was staged at III due to the tumor being more than 5cm, involving more than one quadrant of the breast, and having a positive node. Did you have a full body PET prior to chemo, or a scan of your hip only? Was there a hot spot in your axilla? Do you know if your tumor was in multiple quadrants on your diagnostic testing? You don't have to answer here if you don't want, but if it is important to you to know your staging, you could make your own educated guess with that info. I totally understand why you want to know, I wanted to know too. Personally, I think staging (other than stage IV obviously) is a bit of an art rather than a science in many cases. More than once, I have seen people's signatures and wondered how they were staged as they descibe, given the other information in their sig. ",

I think people who don't know much about BC assume that \"diagnosed young\" = \"caught early\". As far as your implanted cousin...Bless her heart, that is just WRONG. Blah. Windlass, I found a lump - I was too young to have ever had a routine mammo. Everything happened so fast - I found a lump while showering, went to PCP who sent me right to a breast center, mammo and U/S the same day with the radiologist telling me he was 99.9 sure it was cancerous before biopsy, which was done the next day.  Interestingly, I'd had nipple inversion for many, many years: nipple on the \"bad boobie\" could look normal and \"erect\" for lack of a better word, but spent much of its time \"in hiding\" for years. Every time I had a checkup or went to GYN, I mentioned this and was given a manual exam - no one ever felt any lump (nor did I in self-exams until I suddenly did), and I was told again and again I was too young for BC and too young for a mammo. Although to the doctors' credit, they always did ask about family history and I always answered \"none\" - wasn't until after diagnosis that my secret family history was revealed to me, but that's a whole other story...sorry for babbling on! I am really working hard on letting go of a lot of anger over this whole thing...Coulda, shoulda, woulda - story of my life. Re: Diep. That and Lat-flap were the only options given to me too. Due to the extent of radiation I got, was not considered a good candidate for implants. Curious now as to *why* other large tumor sisters are having DIEP recommended -  same reason as me or something else?",
