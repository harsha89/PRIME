Thanx everybody for the support.  I don't feel very brave.  I doubt I'll ever walk around in public with my bald head.  It'll be hard enough to be around the bf or other people I know.  I just figured I'd share with you cuz we're all in the same boat.  But yea, I do actually think I look better than I imagined.  Kind of funny to me.  And its kind of cool having an excuse to wear weird headwraps; sounds strange I know. I had trouble sleeping last night.  I took half the dose of decadron and some ativan, but I felt jittery and kind of like I was going to panic.  So, I popped in a meditation CD on chemotherapy and had some relaxing tea.  It did seem to help enough to ease the anxiety.  Today, I'm going to stop the decardron and ativan and use my regular anxiety meds to see if I feel better.  Well, I'm gonna figure out breakfast and think of what to do with myself today.  Prob pop in a few times unless I go somewhere.

MJ: don't know what to tell u about the weight gain.  I know I've lost 60 ish pounds over the past few years and gained 10 lbs just during the first month I was diagnosed.  But between diarrhea and not being able to eat I'm not worried about too much weight gain right now.  Though my stomach is ballooned way out from all the gases.   Its tough when you can't exercise much either.  I guess I'd suggest eating slow; it takes something like 20 minutes for your brain to register you're full from the time you start eating.  I know if I feel like eating seconds but set my plate aside and wait ten minutes, I almost never feel like eating it then.  I'd try to do the little things cuz its tough.  Good luck.  K, I'm pretty sure I should be sleeping right now.",

I have a cold, too, but I don't feel massively sick yet.  So, wondering if it will be like last time where at the end of the week when the nausea part gets better, the fatigue and just feeling crappy sets in.  I almost liked getting it over all the first week so I had the second full week to feel good.  I only felt good about 3-4 days last tx.  But I only have one more of the AC tx left, then onto taxol which is not suppose to make you so sick.  Yay...I'm hoping. How is everyone else doing? MJ: I've wanted to learn clogging.  I took a little workshop at the bluegrass festival 3 summers ago.  The next year they didn't have the cloggers so I filled out the survey and they were there this year.  I really like watching them.  Often between the drinking and playing guitar at our site with all the cool folks in our area, we forget half the time to go up to the stages and watch the shows.  But I almost always set my drink down and head up solo to watch the cloggers.  Well, hope everybody's hanging in there. ",

My brother just called and he's going to see about coming over Sunday to fix my car.  I'm just about done waiting for bf.  I was considering calling the shop in town and having it towed and fixed but I just can't bring myself to shell out $1000 when we could do it for $300.  So I hope my brother can do it.  I've been without a car for a month now.  Since I don't have tx this week, I've been stuck home with no vehicle.  And bf is thinking about heading up north for the weekend with the guys to visit a high school buddy.  So I should sit out here with no vehicle forever or what?? ",

No big revelations on the diarrhea from onc.  She thought maybe those days I feel like complete shit are from the neulasta (muscle aches etc) so I might try that Clariton when that sets in and see what happens.  I personally think its just from being poisoned by the damn chemo.  It happens after the days where I'm nauseated so about 5 days after tx I get sick. well, gotta go.  chemo's almost over....thank god",

I think I was about 5 years old. I was just learning to write.  We were at grandma's house and I was big into singing to commercial jingles.  I, of course, love the \"plop, plop, fizz, fizz, oh whatta relief it is.\" But I also loved singing along to \"R-O-L-A-I-D-S, spells 100% Relief.  Funny how they're both for indigestion.  Anyway, grandma had this old lipstick that was bright pink.  I took it and wrote on the inside of her armour door, \"R-O-L-O-I-D-S, spells 100% Relief.  Then I went and wrote my brother's name on the wall behind the vanity where it was still visible.  I kind of remember my brother getting in trouble; suppose because they didn't know I could write.  I really don't remember much after that, if I got in trouble.  I can about imagine what they must have thought when they saw that.  And I swear the lipstick in the armour was always there after that. ",

My focus today needs to be on hunting.  I'm going to shoot my gun this afternoon.  I've got my clothes lines up so I'll stay warm.  Bf is bringing a heater for the stand (its a nice enclosed one so I won't fall out either-very good idea with all these drugs pumping in my system).  I've never been deer hunting so I'm excited and a little nervous.  Oh, the stupidest thing said to me was actually by the chemo nurse who I really like.  It was when me and bf went in for chemo education.  I started to cry when she started.  She stopped and came over by me and said, \"so, what part of all of this is upsetting you?\"  I think I just said, \"besides everything?\"  I wanted to say, \"oh, the part where you're going to pump poison into my body, the part where my hair is going to fall out, the part where I'm going to get sick as hell, the part where my life is no longer my own, the part where I have a risk of this crap coming back....take your pick.\"  Now, I'd be more like, \"oh, just the part where I have sit in the waiting room because its so boring and the magazines don't fit my interests.\"  I'm a bit of a smart ass though.  But that's probably what gets me thru. I cry regularly as well and sometimes the stupidest things trigger it.  I try to limit it around bf at least some so i'm not balling every time he comes home.  But its normal and we gotta do what we gotta do to get thru this.  I really try not to be hard on myself for anything right now.  I've put on some weight, too, which I'm not happy about but I know I can get back in shape when this is over.  But it is hard. Urbie:  I really hope you get relief and that your eyes are alright.  It sounds really scary.  Makes you wonder at what point its worth continuing.  Take care...

On a positive note, I've been drinking a lot.  I got sick of the power aid and bought some SoBe Life Water.  Sometimes I mix water with a splash of juice.  I might try that Special K protein water.  I had to pee constantly during the tx.  Cheryll: chemo a lot of times dries the eyes, but I have read on other threads of people saying they're eyes were very watery.  Mary Jo:  Hope your tx went well.  You're such a trooper.  I try to have your attitude about not getting sick (hasn't worked so good for me, but glad you got thru AC so well).  I too do needle work and other things (like tying my fishing lures) so hope we don't get that neuropathy crap.  If I get it, I'm going to talk to onc about doing the every week tx with half dose.  If that doesn't work, we're going to have a long talk about options because quality of life is important to me.

I had a pretty good day today actually, so maybe the positive energy we have together here is helping...or maybe its just the added steroids .  I wasn't able to take Emend this time but don't think I need it since I feel better this tx (2nd one).  1st tx I was sicker than a dog the first week.  For newbies, I'm AC x4, Taxol x4 and 33 tx radiation.  Nancy: I hope things go well with the meds.  I, too, was quite worried.  I already have an anxiety condition and don't tolerate new medications very well, but I have to say its gone much better than I imagined.  So, hang in there.  The oncs work well with managing meds and symptoms so really push if you have concerns or symptoms.  I explained to my onc that I was scared to take the steroid, decadron, because I heard it made you jittery and wired, which for a person with panic disorder sounds like a frickin nightmare. I agreed to do half dose and didn't notice much jittery, but I was quite sick that first week of tx.  For the 2nd tx I had on Monday I braved the full dose and got more to take home.  I think that's what made the difference why I'm feeling much better from this tx than the 1st.  I do take an Ativan (antianxiety med and antinausea) which keeps that jittery feeling under control for me.  Anyway, good luck to you. Marijetta: how u doing?  The steroids make you retain fluid so I'm sure its possible your swelling has something to do with that.  My chemo brain isn't nearly as bad as after the 1st tx but yea its frustrating.  But I am so good that I was able to figure out my boyfriends math problem about the mileage for our trip up north with chemo brain while I was in the bathroom. Take care ladies...",

Marietta: glad to hear u feel better this round, too.  I didn't get the Emend this time but took the full dose of decadron and I've been doing pretty well.  My bf is leaving for moose hunting tomorrow.  I'm feeling a little sad.  We don't spend much time apart for one thing.  And with shaving my hair and all the emotions I feel today, I don't want him to go.  But I know I'm following hopefully soon, though really not looking forward to the long drive by myself.  Yuck!  So, I'll probably be posting a lot being so lonesome.  Take care",

Urbie: congrats on last tx.  Sounds like you had a good thanksgiving also.  Hope things continue going well for you. Mary Jo: I hope I get drawn for turkey hunting, too.  I can relate to the screaming.  I warned my bf that when I actually get something, I'll be yelling and doing my butt shakin dance.  I make fun of how the people react on the outdoor channel when they get something.  Each person does their own little funny things.  One guy even started to cry over a deer ( thought that was a little weird).  My bf says I don't look very excited ever (like when I tried bowfishing the first time and was hitting fish).  But during that kind of activity, I think I'm so focused on getting the fish in and off the arrow and then back at it.  Its not like when you wait for a deer and shoot, then you're done and you have your trophie.  I'd probably even do a happy dance shooting a pheasant.  Better remember to put the safety back on and the gun down before though  . We just got the driveway clear yesterday and we're suppose to get nailed again tonight.  I did the grocery shopping this morning so we're set that way.  And yes, I did get out to collect brush.  I might go out again this afternoon for more.  I also want to work on the insulation for the utility room (pipes are always freezing up for the washer) and one window is broken.  And I bought some christmas lights to hang along the front porch.  Geez they're expensive.  Well, I'm still a little crabby and scattered, but I'm trying to relax about it.  I get frustrated sometimes because I feel like in that movie Groundhogs Day with Bill Murray, where I get up and do the same crap every day (dishes, cleaning, laundry, make supper).  I don't so much mind doing all those things but I realized I don't do many things for enjoyment because half the time I don't know what I enjoy.  My bf is such a go out and do things type person that I sort of just follow along with him.  But when he's working, I'm left to myself and I don't really know what I like to do.  Guess I should just relax about this, too, and just do some things.  Bf reminds me I think too much.  He's right. Here's a picture of my dog Miller.  A kiddie pool blew through the yard one day and I nabbed it for Miller on those hot summer days.  Bf thinks that's funny.  But look how happy he his.  He's a wonderful dog.  I wouldn't want to be out in 90 degree weather with a black fur coat on.

Karyll: If your tongue feels thick and gross, make sure to use a mouthwash several times a day of 8oz water, 1/8 tsp salt, and 1 tsp baking soda.  You can develop a yeast infection in your mouth or just mouth sores.  I didn't have any pain from the neulasta shot.  sorry to hear Have a great day ladies!!  I'm gonna get me some mint chocolate chip soy ice cream from town (stomach can't handle real thing but this is close enough-I can't wait)  ",

I've been making some progress with the diet.  I bought a bunch of those yogurt packs.  I eat one whenever I want a snack (instead of ice cream, brownies, and cake) and it helps with the stomach problems from tx.  I also make an afternoon snack out of my metamucil cookies (how crafty is that?).  And no seconds at meal time.",

The area we'll be hunting in is way up in the very tip of the east side just miles from Canada.  We're going to stay at a bear hunting camp run by the guy we sell our fur to during trapping season.  Last night I dreamt about moose hunting; that my bf shot a bull and when I went the follow up shot, there were several and I couldn't tell which one was the one he had shot.  Guess the DNR impacted me with their long speech on what will happen if you accidentally shoot 2 moose.  Well, that's what I know today.  Its cool to see my whole post with nothing about cancer (other than this sentence lol).",

I haven't worn a wig yet, but I'd say make sure to wear a nylon cap or some protecting cap under it.  Maybe that would help with the discomfort.  I also bought what's called a \"fall.\"  You can either get ones that velcro into a hat or they come sewn onto a ring that fits on your head.  It basically lets hair stick out the side of your hat, scarf, or turban.  Might not be so itchy.  Well, talk to EB later..... ",

I had a better day today.  Bf came home late from being out with the guys.  He's so cute and talkative when he's had a few.  Laying in bed with him then is my favorite time.  He asked me if I was mad at him because I hardly looked at him all afternoon.  (we've never had a fight and I can't really recall being mad at him so I think its funny that he'd say that but I suppose he was clueless).  I told him I just missed him so much that it was hard for me to be around him with all those people because I just wanted to cry.  And it was a little tough seeing the moose and hearing everything when I didn't get to go.  Then he grabbed me and said he just wanted to hold me in his arms all night (he's not a touchy feely sorta person unless we've been apart).  It was just what I needed.  And we spent the day together.  That's how it should be.  We don't talk a lot but its not right if he's not there.  So everything in the world is right again. Except I have treatment #3 tomorrow.  But one tx closer to done. I'm going to ask my onc more about my diarrhea at my appt.  I've had it pretty much the whole time.  Well, that's my deal...Take care everybody",

I'm waiting to here when I'll have my ear surgery.  I want that done and over so I can try and go back to work.  I'm so broke its not even funny.  We ran out of fuel oil so just have the wood burner for this last bit of colder weather.  My govt rebate check will be going to pay for my car insurance.  Its an interesting transition back to \"normal\" life.  I feel great, then nervous, then overwhelmed, then scared, then great again.  Well, take care!!!",

On a different note: I made some chocolate pudding today that was actually good (I say it that way because I made the recipe up myself).  I put 2 bananas, 1/4 container tofu, about 1/2 cup almond milk, 1 Kale leaf, 6 tsp cocoa, 1 tsp vanilla, 2 tbsp agave nectar and afew drops of stevia in the blender and chilled. Gage loves it which is good since he's a very picky eater.   ",

But its also what allows us to live through cancer so I try really hard to focus on that and cry if I want to.",

I never had nail problems with taxol.  I did start getting the numbness and tingling.  I feel the Acetyl-L Carnitine really helped.  I got bone pain for about 4 days, 2-3 days after the tx.  L- Glutamine 3x's daily also helped with that.  Without it I took Vicodin at night a couple times. I'm just not big into pain meds if I can help it.  Yet I'm not one to enjoy buying a bunch of supplements that don't do anything either.  These two seemed to make a difference; only reason I'm mentioning them.  My new tx schedule puts my end date the end of Aug.  The other schedule would have had me finish the very beginning of Aug.  Now I don't know what to do.  My BF goes back to work Aug 17th.  He's been the main caretaker of the baby so I don't know what the hell to do.  I can't take care of the baby alone.  There are a few people who can help here and there, but what about the rest of the time. ",

Though my mouth sores prevented me from enjoyin the big fish fry this afternoon.  Tomorrow I'm starting back to healthy eating.  I'm going to fire up the juicer for breakfast. As per my recurrence, I was originally dx 7/07,  had a lumpectomy, did dd AC/taxol and 33 rads.  My first follow-up mri came back clear but with glowing areas which they didn't know what to do with.  Then I got unexpectedly pregnant in Oct and missed any follow up testing until after Gage was born.  I had bronchitis really bad for like 2 months so I finally got the mri done in Dec which is when they found it was back.  Something showed up on my liver on the CT scan so for the first 2 months I thought I had mets with less than 2 years to live which was just so great.  But after doing a series of Abraxane chemo and having PET scans, they decided the liver spot wasn't cancer.  So I had a db mast and onto the chemo regime I'm on now.  3 weeks after I'm done with chemo I'll have another PET scan and I just hope and pray its clear.  This last chemo has really knocked me down for the count and I just really want to move on.  Anyway, that's why I'm looking into healthier eating and living since I didn't do anything different after the first cancer.  I want to improve my odds as best I can.  What I can say about recurrence is that I was absolutely terrified of it the first time I went thru it, but when it happen (even with the mets scare), I was much less freaked out about it than being dx the first time.  Not that I wish it upon anyone, but figured I'd pass it along.  I think when your mind has time to digest things, it adapts.  Plus the second time around I didn't need to learn all the details and lingo.  I just needed to know what to do. And as far as when my hair grew back, it was almost white at first which freaked me out completely.  The color came back shortly though.  Then there was a little phase where there were all different lengths sprouting and I felt like a duckling. I didn't know if I was suppose to have it trimmed or just let it grow.  I just let it grow and it evened out and grew in just fine all by itself.  Then I got little cowlick like whispers.  I had my friend trim them off and things were back on course and the rest was history.  Hope everybody has a good week.  I don't know if I'm having tx or not because of the fever thing.  I really hate pushing things back. ",

I was able to get 2 post surgery camisoles that my insurance covered which was nice.  They have pouches that velcro in for the drain tube bags that can be removed when you're done with those.  And it has stuffing for the boobs that can be adjusted.  So, I'm hoping I can wear those for quite awhile after until I decide what else to do.",

I was just as scared going to my 1st taxol tx so being afraid is normal even after you've already been through it.  At times you'll feel numb and just keep moving forward, then you'll sit and cry.  Its all normal.  There's a great thread on tips somewhere in here.  Here's what I can think of off the top of my head. Keep products for constipation and diarrhea on hand.  Often the first days of tx make u constipated and later some get diarrhea.  I had diarrhea for nearly 2 months.  Eating soup with rice, bananas, toast, and apple juice will help slowly build substance.  Make a mouthwash of water, a little salt and a little baking soda.  It will help with mouthsores.  If they get bad, the dr can prescribe \"magic mouthwash.\"  I also got yeast infections so I kept diflucan on hand. I kept books on tape on hand for when I felt crappy and just wanted to lay down.  Someone earlier mentioned writing things down.  Have a folder to keep track of everything because its overwhelming and once you start chemo u get a little fuzzy.  Especially keep a log of what meds you take the first days after chemo because its a lot of pills to keep track of and you want to keep on schedule and not overtake. My hair got brittle and gross about 13 days after my 1st tx.  I chose to shave it off at that time.  I have a wig.  But most of the time I wear a turban with a bandana over it.  I also have a hair \"fall\" which is just hair that sticks out of your hat so it looks like you have hair but its not a full wig.  Drink, drink, drink.  The more you drink, the better you'll feel.  I found it hard to drink just water.  I drank gatorade until I couldn't stand that and then moved on to those flavored waters.  Well, Hope this isn't too overwhelming a post.  I just remember being where you are and I'm so excited to be the one coming back saying, \"hey, you can do this and you will be where I am feeling obligated to talk to the next group starting.\"  Good Luck ladies!!  Use the live chat, too, if you're really freaking out.  It helps a lot.",
