Asked for Oncotype testing - came back today as a 25.  Wondering what others would do??? Part of me says - do whatever it takes to be reasonably assured it won't come back...Another part of me says no since everything else seemed to indicate low likelihood of recurrence.  Anyone have suggestions for me or questions to ask my oncologist? Anyone else from the Madison, WI area? I LOVE my medical team. I feel blessed in that regard.",

He was pretty neutral before. I'm right at the new standard.  I am going to check the chemo strands but any recommendations for combinations to consider or questions about SE to ask about the chemo would be helpful.  I just don't want to take any chances...I don't want to seriously damage my body, but I also DO NOT want this back.  I know me - and I would beat myself up if I chose not to and it came back.",

I developed trust in them and was open and honest about how I was feeling and what I needed in order to make the best decisions for me.  When we talked about the surgery, my doctors agreed to call me with results as soon as they came in. I don't know if that's unusual or not, but I didn't want to wait for an appointment to get the results. If that's something you want, you might want to check with them about this. For me, I was most worried about the lymph nodes...but in the end I figured there's nothing I could do to change the result - I would just continue to make rational decisions based upon the next set of facts. That has helped me. Another thing that I wish someone had advised...Post surgery I was told to wear a sports bra 24/7.  That was not comfortable for me for the first couple of weeks, especially due to the SNB incision.  My doctor gave me a breast binder that helped but it was only one so I did order another on-line.  Maybe others can comment on whether these helped, their hospitals had them or where they obtained them. I just wish someone would have suggested I order one in advance! Good luck and stay positive!",

For someone new to all this, you cannot know how valuable your insights are.  I really value the piece about it being my body - but it's hard when your daughter says you are rushing into something that you may not really need.  She just doesn't understand that I'm worried about recurrence and I want to be around for a really long time.  While my family doesn't have a history of BC, it does with a bunch of others.  I just don't want to mess around with this and take any changes. Thanks for all your help and support. Erin",
