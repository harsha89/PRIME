I really like her, but I have traveled to other places for treatment (M.D. Anderson for radiation and plan to begin a trial in July at MSK). We have ok doctors here, just not a lot of access to clinical trials which is why U of M or Karmanos might be better.",

I have completed 4 treatments (2 Carbo/Taxol and 2 Taxol only) and in the weeks following Carboplatin I have had 2 \"episodes\" of vertigo. I call them episodes because I don't have general dizziness, they are more acute episodes of sudden vertigo. Both times I was watching TV and suddenly felt the room spinning, and the feeling only lasts about 10 seconds. The feeling is intense, but because it is over so quickly doesn't cause any nausea or any other side effects. I did see vertigo can be a more rare side effect of Carboplatin or Cisplatin. Has anyone else experienced anything similar? I have no previous history with vertigo, and this has only occurred since starting Carboplatin. Thank you!

My MO said it could last as long as 6 months after treatment! They never mentioned this in the beginning! I'm overall pretty happy with how I have tolerated things, I mean chemo hasn't really prevented me from doing anything or living my life, but I am young and was in good health before this so it is so annoying to have all these new ailments all the time! And don't get me started on my medicine cabinet, it's ridiculous how many different medications I have now!",

They want me to watch it, and if it gets bad they may order some imaging or can give me medication to help with it. I did have her check my ears for infection because I have had random achy pains in my ears (luckily no ringing or hearing loss) but they were fine. I have heard permanent hearing loss can happen, even after treatment so I want to make sure to watch this closely. I considered having her refer me to an ENT, just to see if there has already been damage. I guess I'll wait and see if it happens again.",

I am triple negative and everything was such a whirlwind- biopsy Feb 10th, results Feb 14th, many other mammograms, ultrasounds, an echocardiogram another biopsy, port placed and MRI and I started chemo March 3rd. One thing I have learned in this process is that you have to advocate for yourself- it's nice that most places have nurse navigators, but you are the driver. If you are concerned I would push for an earlier surgery- I got mine moved up 2 weeks because I thought 6 weeks was a long time to wait after chemo and my MO agreed so we made a few phone calls and bam, it was done!",

He mentioned they had done a lot of research in this area recently and have found stronger treatments are usually well tolerated and just as effective.",
