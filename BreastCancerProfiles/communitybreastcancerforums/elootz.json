My sisters were always jealous of my hair and now . . . I really feel like all my stress would be lessened if I just had hair and could feel more like myself again. Like, I could deal with the flat chest, and the scars and the radiation burns if I could look in the mirror and see something familiar.",

I have some thin hair around my face, but from the back I am basically bald. I have grown out the front hairs to the point were I can almost get away with combing it over, but it is so thin that it really does not work. I'm here wondering if anyone has had any luck with hair regrowth treatments of any kind. I've been taking Biotin for a year but I don't think it does anything. I know I can wear wigs, but I really hated my wig during treatment. I also lost my eyebrows post chemo and have been drawing them on with mild success but it's the hair on my head I just can't seem to live without. I had super thick, super healthy, hair before cancer. It was easily my best feature, so this is hitting me really hard. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks.",

Also stopped using Aquafor and switching over to aloe vera gel per the doc. We'll see if these steps make things better. No fatigue yet, but I'm trying to stay active cause I read that helps.

I've got 3 more regular rad sessions and then 5 boosts to go. I'm red, but no peeling skin yet. I think my active lifestyle might be helping with the fatigue as I'm not feeling it yet after 25 sessions. Fingers crossed that holds true to the end. I discovered a bump in my pubic area this week and I'm freaking out a bit that it is a sign of some new cancer. I see my oncologist Tuesday so I'll ask about it then. I already have surgery scheduled for November to have my ovaries removed so maybe they can just roll it into that surgery if it needs to be removed. Who knows?

Was supposed to start a few weeks ago, but they have done so much mapping, CT's and X-rays due to my heart pressing on my chest wall. I have to hold my breath during treatment and have x-rays at every session so my sessions usually last 30-40 minutes. My docs did not recommend any creams or ointments or anything. When I asked if I should be putting something on the area, they said not until I start seeing any reactions. This seems weird since most of you talk about being given or prescribed creams or told to apply things before and during treatment regardless of showing SE's. I meet with my RO every Wednesday, so I'll ask again tomorrow. I also think it's interesting that some of you have been told to wait on starting Tamoxifen until after rads. I started the same time for both and no one seems concerned about SE's. Maybe it's because I'm at a cancer center at a large university or something. Anyway, it's been really helpful reading all your posts and knowing I'm not alone on some of this stuff.",

Is that what anyone else's skin looks like, acne? I was expecting it to look like a sunburn. Good luck and stay safe to all those in the storms projected path.",

I think the problem was that I saw one doctor for my first appointment, but then she retired and I have a new doctor who actually manages my treatments. I guess he forgot to mention that he changed the plan. So here I was finished with 20 sessions today thinking I only had 10 more to go. It's only 3 sessions, but I started to tear up. This is not the first time I was told one thing and then everything changed and no one bothered to tell me. I mean my initial diagnosis was stage 2B, then I find out months later that I'm actually stage 3A. Was told at initial appointment that I wouldn't need to have my ovaries removed, but I'm having surgery in November now. It would be nice if for once the change was for the better, but it's always worse. I've come to expect the worst now everytime I see a doctor.",
