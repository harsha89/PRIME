But probably the next step will be a liver biopsy.  When they found my liver tumor that is what my doc did.  I think it depends on where the lesion is, how large, and if there is one or many.  Mine was 1 large one and where they could get to it easily.  I had my biopsy with' light'  sedation to calm the person and ease the pain.  Then stayed for 2-3 hours watching for bleeding and recovering from the meds.  The biopsy will confirm metastasis and if it is ER/PR positive or negative and the HER2 status.  I see you are already Stage 4 and on treatments, so this would show if the cancer mutated and the current meds are not working anymore.  But I don't know your specifics--ER/PR HER2 status, previous scan results, Labs, etc.  When is your next doc visit??  My prayers are with you.",

Was diagnosed with CT of abdomen and I had a PET scan of body and MRI of brain in Sept to get a baseline.    My MO states his protocol is CT every 3 months.  He has not said to do PET or MRI brain again.    But how do you all check for OTHER mets?? Such as, God forbid,  traveling to lung, brain, etc.   I know the CT would see the lungs along with the liver, but how about the brain.  Do we not routinely check unless symptoms occur?   Can the liver lesions be controlled on the meds, but new sites appear elsewhere?? If so, and we check only the CT and see no change in the liver would we be under false impression cancer is controlled when it is not?   Sorry, I really need to ask my MO these questions.

Maybe someone else can chime in. We started Lupron/Letrozole/Ibrance combo and liver mass has decreased in size.   Wishing you good success with your surgery and then the treatment plan your MO puts you on.

I was talking with a friend this weekend and he said \" I cannot believe you have cancer.  You are still working.  You still attend church ( we attend the same church ).  You look healthy\"---he meant not grey, skinny, frail.     And really I feel pretty good overall, I guess.  I have fatigue and pain, but it is doable so far.  I am still up and around and living life.   So I started thinking.   We are told that these meds are slowing the cancer.  There is no cure.  This will eventually be terminal.    And then I think-- how will it progress?  When?  I don't feel terminal yet.  Is there a \"normal\" way this goes???   Does the liver tumor start growing bigger, since we know it is in the liver and we watch the liver every 3 months with CT??    Will the cancer spread to other areas not effected yet??  Will I one day have a seizure or can't talk and know it has spread to the brain, will I have trouble breathing and know it has spread to the lungs, will I have GI problems and it has spread to the GI tract??   Those with progression on here--How does it progress??   How does it eventually kill us??  Will I live 1 more year, or like some have posted, 10 years??   Or more.  No one knows.  So just waiting for the other shoe to drop and never knowing when it will happen. What should I expect to happen with MBC??? I need to have this conversation with my MO, but as you all know our doc appointments are limited and I have other things to discuss when I see my MO.   Thoughts...\u2026.",
