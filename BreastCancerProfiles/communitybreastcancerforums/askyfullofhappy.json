MY doctor wasn't so concerned till I started having a slight redness on my breast. I had an MRI (as soon as my doctor saw it she sent me for an MRI stat and an appointment with a breast surgeon oncologist stat as well) I had the MRI on Tuesday night and I wanted to update that the MRI was all clear no signs of anything. My breast surgeon was fantastic and really cleared up my worries about IBC. She told me how there was no worries that they could have missed anything especially with the MRI. I just wanted to update you all and say thank to all the ladies that were so nice to me last time I posted and kept me in their minds. Thanks so much. I hope treatment goes well for everyone, you are all on my mind. Now time to work on my anxiety. Hoping for the best and warm regards, Maria Log in to post a reply",
