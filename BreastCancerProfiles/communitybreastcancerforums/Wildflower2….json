I don't understand what it says either,but there is a member of the community, Barred Owl, who is very helpful and knowledgeable about medical terminology. She does a great job explaining terms that non-medical folks (like me) can understand. Hopefully she will notice your post and respond. This community is a wonderful source of support. Please keep checking in as you continue through these early days. You will get through this, I promise.  ((hugs))",

This, after he basically blew off my other questions about general side effects by saying the benefits outweighed the risks. He said if he had to put me on the biphosphenates that I would also have to get medical clearance from an oral specialist. I've pretty much decided to go with tamoxifen at this point IF I do anything.",

Did anyone else start to experience hair regrowth while in the last cycle, or fresh out of chemo on the taxotere/cytoxan regimen? My hair thinned overall during treatment, and while there weren't any truly bald spots, there was noticeable thinning in some places on the crown where the caps must not have been in good enough contact. I seemed to shed the majority of hair somewhere between the first and second rounds of TC. I am now only 3 weeks PFC, and for the last week I've noticed the thinner spots are now covered with hundreds of tiny black specks which I assume are hair follicles. They get more obvious and seem to be spreading more every day. I can also feel tiny little stubble all over my head, mixed in with the longer hair. So it had to have started while I was still actively doing chemo. I thought that some ladies had regrowth on Taxol, but TC was too harsh. Not sure if I should post here, or on the life after cold caps thread, so I'll do both :-/",

I cold capped during 4 rounds of taxotere/cytoxan, and while my hair thinned, it never got to the point where I had bald spots or needed a wig. Results will vary from person to person, but despite what your oncologist said, there are a lot of us out here who have cold capped and kept their hair! There seems to be better success if you're not getting adriamycin as part of your chemo. That is the drug with the reputation for only 50% success. Patients who get taxotere, taxol, and cytoxan, or some of the other drugs have a higher success rate. My former oncologist did not tell me that taxotere can cause permanent hair loss in 6-8% of cases, so I was really glad I did the cold capping once I found out about that! Some oncologists are just not up to date or very well informed on cold capping. That will probably change since the FDA recently approved Dignicaps (a type of cold cap). Here's a couple of links for you to look at while you're going through the waiting process: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/6/topics/... Be sure to click on the links to other capping threads which are cited in the introductory post by Dancetrancer. https://penguincoldcaps.com/ There are other brands, but this is the type of cap I used, and the one you'll hear about a lot on the discussion threads. Good luck with your treatment and whatever you decide to do regarding capping!",

I was on the short Canadian protocol. Today I just finished my 17th and final whole breast radiation. Now I only have my 5 boosts left and I'll be done! (for a total of 22 in all). I have had very little problems throughout. My skin on the underside of the treated breast is a little pink. The rest of the area that got radiated is slightly pink. That's it. The skin is holding up great, and I've had no problems with itching, pain, tenderness, rawness, not even close to blistering or rash. My breast and nipple does feel a little tender if I press on it, pretty much like premenstrual tenderness used to feel. Other than that, nada. Yay! Because I truly didn't have any discomfort and my breast wasn't screaming for attention, I admit I forgot about it lot of the time. I maybe lotioned up once a day, twice max. I used the CVS aloe (green, no lidocaine) and Miaderm. I used the Miaderm mostly because I had bought it ahead of time, thinking I would need it, and that stuff is too expensive to waste!! I haven't used anything else. I shower using Dove body wash. I have not had to change my bra habits, and have been wearing my underwire bras throughout (I'm a size C), no problem there either. I bought a boatload of cami's from Walmart thinking I might have to go braless for a while, but so far, no need. Hoping the 5 boosts go as well as the 17 WBRs did. I guess there's always the possibility that things can still go south this late in the game, but I thought it would be good to put a positive experience out there, just to keep things balanced. I have to think the Canadian protocol is responsible at least in part for the lack of problems. If you will be starting radiation soon, I suggest that you ask your RO about it. Good wishes to all who will soon be starting their rads, and to those currently in treatment! ",

I had my simulation today and got more details on my treatment plan. I'm doing the Canadian protocol, and will be receiving 18 treatments to the right breast only, plus 5 boosts. The dry run is next Thursday. I'll start radiation on October 20. Hoping for the best - will be following this thread avidly! ",

The tech said it was fine to wash them off, but I've tried alcohol wipes, lotion, and plain old body wash, and nothing worked. All it did was smear it around so it looks like I have giant bluish bruises on my chest. I would just let it wear off naturally but I'm going to be at a resort with a pool this weekend and don't want to be sporting this look in public. Any suggestions?",

      "Content": "Nov 12, 2015 06:24PM - edited Nov 12, 2015 06:25PM by Wildflower2015 Hi, Kimmer33, The most common radiation protocol here in the US involves 5 or 6 weeks of radiation treatments (30+ individual treatments). The Canadian protocol is basically a shorter (3 week) regimen with slightly higher dosages of radiation (measured in grays) given per treatment compared to the longer protocol. However, the total amount of grays is the same as you would get in the longer regimen, they're just administered over a shorter time frame. It's been the standard practice in Canada and the UK for a long time; here (in the US) it still is gaining acceptance. Here are a couple of articles written for laymen (like me) which explain the process and the potential benefits to the patient: http://www.breastcancer.org/research-news/benefits... http://www.breastcancer.org/research-news/shorter-... http://newsatjama.jama.com/2013/09/20/study-confir... You can ask your MO if your type of tumor fits the requirements to participate in the regimen. Good luck and smooth sailing with your rads! ",

      "Content": "Jun 29, 2016 06:22PM - edited Jun 29, 2016 06:30PM by Wildflower2015 Lisey, Before you decide that capping doesn't work, please look at the following threads: Cold Cap Users Past and Present: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/6/topics/... Cold Capping Success Stories with Photos: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/6/topics/... Cold Cap Newbies: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/6/topics/... I am 10 months out from chemo and I can tell you that in the last year there have been a number of women on these threads who capped successfully. Yes, it didn't work for a few (some were on a harsher chemo regime), but most of the ladies I remember did have success. It may seem like an overwhelming amount of information and a steep learning curve, but every one of us learned to do it! It was so worth it to me - keeping my hair was the one bright spot in the whole cancer crappalooza. These are the reasons I decided to go for it: 1. Risk of permanent hair loss if you are given the chemo drug taxotere - it's hard to figure out exactly, but the percentage of women who suffer permanent hair loss is somewhere between 6-8%, and I have heard even as high as 10%. 2. If I lost my hair and it did grow back, there was no guarantee that my hair would return the same as before regarding texture, color, thickness, etc. 3. I just plain hated the idea of being bald (vanity!!) and knowing it could take up to 2 years to get my hair back to anything resembling normal In your case, you might also want to think about these things: 1. Capping Cost - there is a financial assistance program that can help save you money if you rent the Penguin caps. Otherwise you can buy the Elastogel caps which are quite a bit cheaper. 2. Wig cost - I don't know what it costs to make a wig, but either way, you are spending money on the very same hair. It's up to you whether you want to spend it on hair that is still attached to your head :-) Oh yeah, and the cold was tolerable - it only hurt for the first 5 minutes or so, and then my head stayed pretty numb throughout the rest of the treatment. I hope no one thinks I am pressuring you, but girl, you have an amazing head of hair and if it was mine I'd be doing everything I could to hang onto it!  ",

      "Content": "Jun 30, 2016 11:07AM Wildflower2015 wrote: Lisey, Regarding cold cap choices: The Dignicap system is very new in the U.S., as it was just approved by the FDA a few months ago. I have no experience with them, and don't recall anyone on these boards using them either. So I can't really speak for Dignicaps one way or the other Since you asked my opinion, if the cost isn't an issue, I'd go with Penguin. There seems to be consistently more overall success with Penguin users vs the elastogel caps. Just to clarify, if you're not using Penguin's patented caps, you will be getting elastogel caps, regardless of the company (such as Arctic Cold Caps) you choose, or if you buy them online yourself. There are only 2 kinds of caps available - Penguin and the elastogels.The Penguin caps are designed to lay flat while freezing, as opposed to the elastogel caps, which are more bowl shaped. The bowl shape means you have to pay more attention to freezing the inside of the cap, since it won't completely flatten out like the Penguin. Some people put additional dry ice into the inside, not sure exactly how they do it. I don't know, it sounded like a pain in the butt to me :-P In contrast, the Penguins have multiple velcro adjustment points so you can take the flat, frozen cap and tighten it on your head for the best fit. The elastogel caps use velcro straps, but because of the way the caps are molded (kind of like a swim cap) you may have more trouble with spaces between the cap and scalp if the caps don't fit the shape of your head too well. At least that is my understanding, if I'm incorrect, I guess the elastogel ladies can provide better feedback :-) For ladies with extra thick hair (that's you!) Penguin also can provide additional gel straps for extra cooling. I didn't have to use any because my hair is baby fine. I suggest you view the Penguin videos, and maybe give the rep a call. Regarding the luminal B issue - our stats are pretty identical regarding the ER+/PR- , so I'm guessing we'll see each other on that thread, too. ",
