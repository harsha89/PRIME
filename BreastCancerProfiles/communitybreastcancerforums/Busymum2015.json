I said I wanted her to be a 100% sure and what was causing indentation, she thinks it could be due to breasts returning to normal after being pregnant with twin's. I asked fir a mri as I wanted more than a guess, she said she didn't think it necessary as it can give false positives. To which I replied I would rather have a false positive than a false negative. Because I wouldn't quit she agreed to see me in 2 weeks as she should have had time to review the mammogram as well. I asked how long should I wait if the indentation got worse or didn't go. She said 3-4 months and then she would review again. So my question to you ladies would be should I be happy with 99% or do I keep pushing for a 100% answer one way or another? My gut tells me to keep pushing, but then I worry I am just being paranoid!",

At first I thought they were stretch marks, but definitely not they look more like a dark shading on the skin and if I stretch my boob up just above these is another indentation that looks like someone has stuck a pen nib into my boob...weird! I have a question I have pain in my other breast when I feel for any lumps (this is difficult due to scar tissue having previously had a golf ball sized lump removed 20 years ago) the pain is kind of between my boob and armpit!

The doctor agreed invasive lobular cancer can be missed on mammograms and ultrasounds, but still didn't want to do an mri. I explained politely but firmly that I wasn't happy with doctors guessing what was causing the indentation I wanted an answer that I felt confident in. He suggested the indentation and lumpiness could be caused by age. Arrrgh nope I wasn't having any of it. He then suggested a needle biopsy, but needs to discuss with the consultant first. He then came back to say the consultant would rather an mri be done first to give a clearer idea of where to biopsy. So another 2-3 weeks for appointment to come through and then another week for results. Its okay as at least I should have some answers. It is very frustrating how much I need to push to get an answer I am happy with. Still hoping it has a simple benign explanation. Thank you all x",

She was shocked that only a mammogram had been done as I have 6 month old babies and my breasts would be very dense so anything would be unlikely to show up. She also said a GP should not just assume that the indentation was caused by my breasts returning to normal after having my children and that she had not heard of this causing tethering of the skin before. She advised that I get seen as soon as possible and ask to be referred to a breast cancer clinic. She also said I can choose which clinic I go to and to research online the reviews of each clinic before making my decision. Feeling a little more positive that I have an action plan and have made an appointment to see another GP at the practice for Monday 19th. This was the earliest appointment they had but at least its a start. Thank you so much for all the information and support. I will keep you all posted.",

He thinks indentations are caused by breast ligament changes, but was honest enough to this was a guess. He reassured me having viewed numerous MRI scans throughout his career I was fine, if it was cancer attaching to skin it would be big enough to show up. Ultrasound was for suspicious area on right breast between scar tissue. Ultrasound looked normal, but needs to be discussed with a panel of doctors to decide if we take a wait and see approach or carry out MRI biopsy. I am not worried about this as the know false positives can show up and consultant said he was certain the risk was low of it being sinister.

I showed the gp the photos of breast in natural daylight and he immediately agreed I needed a second opinion and asked which hospital I wanted referring too, unfortunately it could take up to 2 weeks for the appointment to come through but at least he listened and understood my concerns. The hospital I had mammogram done at hadn't even sent the report through to the gp yet. On another note I have had horrendous pain in my knee (on the same side as dodgy boob) the previous gp said it was arthritis it would get better on its own take anti inflammatory medication. I brought it up telling him it is much worse are there stronger anti inflammatory tablets I could take. He said I shouldn't have arthritis at my age and said he was ordering an mri on my knee to see what is going on. Why can't all doctors be like him instead of brushing you off. Hopefully next update will be soon and a definite positive outcome. Thanks again for your support x ",

The doctor said lobular tissue like it was a normal thing and nothing to worry about. I didn't think to question it at the time, but so wish I had. I am determined to get an answer where I can stop worrying. I am going to ask what would she do differently in 3-4 months as I am not convinced the indentation is \"normal changes due to previous pregnancy\" and ask they carry out those tests now. I will continue to push for an mri. I have done some research and the hospital I am attending has a private patient facility for breast mri scans, so if need be I will ask to be referred there for the scan (I still need a referral from a doctor to attend the private scan). Shetland Pony thank you I have never asked for a second opinion in my life, but I can't quit until I have an answer that I feel confident in.
