There were 2 in each breast over the past 12 years- the largest ever being 6mm. Over the years I've had serial ultrasounds every 6 month to a year and occasional mammos and an MRI (which I can no longer have because I had a bad reaction to the gadolidium.) My last mammo was in February of 2014 revealed my stable fibroadenomas. Nothing new. A few shrank, one grew very slightly (it was 3 x 4mm. It was recommended that I follow up with ultrasound rather than mammo in the future because my breasts are very dense. I just went back to a new facility (new insurance) with all of my films.. and found out that this mass has grown from 3-4mm to 13-14mm and that while it looks like a fibroadenoma it doesn't exactly have all the perfect hallmark edges.. Is it common for these to grow this quickly? If so.. should I have it removed or just biopsied? I'm very worried. I'm more worried that I'm worried because I'm ordinarily not concerned with these things at all. I just have a bad feeling :( I should add that there seems to also be a much smaller mass directly beside it (almost kissing it), another below it, and another in the other breast. I can't decide if this is good news of bad! Any input is welcome thank you Log in to post a reply",

I've had a somewhat similar looking rash for 10 days now that is non responsive to OTC cortisone cream. Mine is beginning to looked bruised. If I lift my breast to look underneath I'll get mild discharge as well. I'm not sure if it's just because I'm manipulating the breast too much from examinating it, or if it's something else to worry about. I'm definitely calling my doctor tomorrow though I've made myself crazy with this all weekend *sigh I love/hate the Internet. I hope all turned out well for you.",
