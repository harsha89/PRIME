    "Content": "Bridgetteroxanne wrote: I noticed a indention in my right breast about 4 o'clock right outside my nipple, I went and had an mamo done it came back as clear and normal breast tissue, my doctor was not satisfied with that result so he sent me for an ultra sound that came back as clear also except for a cyst at 9 o;clock on right breast, he then sent me to a breast specialist who ordered a breast MRI with/wo contrast that showed nothing suspicious, she also has done a genetic cancer testing that we are still waiting on, but in the meantime I still have this indention and now flattening just under the indention, nobody can tell me what is going on here and the waiting is killing me. I feel like I should be doing something more to find out what is causing this, has anyone else here ever experience anything like this? Log in to post a reply",
