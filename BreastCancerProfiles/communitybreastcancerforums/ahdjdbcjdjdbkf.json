My nausea from my first treatment was all consuming and lasted 6 days. If I have to be out of work for 7-8 more weeks to get through this I can do it and keep my job. If I can't get back to work right away on Taxol / Herceptin I will probably default on my home and auto now so I can keep food and electricity through Taxol. I'm curious to hear from anyone who has gone from biweekly A/C to Taxol / Herceptin weekly if the weekly T/H has less nausea. I've been through serious injuries and worked through them with the right pain meds. I can handle all the vanity side effects and pain but I can't work with the nausea. I would love to hear ANY experience from anyone on this regimen. Also interested in how it is when you get to Hereceptin only because I will be on that for another 40 weeks. I have no one and nothing to fall back on so making decisions with my resources upfront is vital to my continued insurance, food, etc. Thanks for your time and I wish everyone the very best of luck with all you are going through too. - Maria Dx 3/2/2012, IDC, Right, 3cm, Stage IIA, Grade 3, 1/12 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2+ (FISH) Dx 3/2/2012, IDC, 1cm, Stage IIA, Grade 3, 1/12 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Surgery 3/22/2012 Mastectomy: Left, Right Chemotherapy 4/5/2012 AC + T (Taxol) Targeted Therapy 6/27/2012 Herceptin (trastuzumab) Radiation Therapy 10/7/2012 3DCRT: Breast, Lymph nodes Surgery 1/27/2013 Reconstruction (left); Reconstruction (right) Surgery 8/6/2013 Reconstruction (right): Latissimus dorsi flap Surgery 8/6/2013 Reconstruction (left) Surgery 2/24/2014 Reconstruction (left): Nipple reconstruction; Reconstruction (right): Nipple reconstruction Log in to post a reply",

I hate being pushed to links and studies because I truly think a lot of it is just not accurate. It is still a relatively new health condition in terms of there being any actual \"standard of care\" or meaningful studies. Being told to go to certain pages that I haven't found helpful over and over (and over!) again is not only annoying, but it somewhat makes me angry. We can be honest here, right? So I would absolutely LOVE to hear things that anyone has discovered actually lessen swelling after it kicks up, and or prevents it. I've been dealing with this condition about 18 months and it has on many days pushed me to a point of desperation that I can't share without someone trying to lock me up. I have paid a fortune for the most trained lymphedema therapists in all the latest methods and it did absolutely nothing but stress me over the increasing balance on my credit card.
