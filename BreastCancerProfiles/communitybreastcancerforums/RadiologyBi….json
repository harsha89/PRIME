First, I would like to extend my condolences to each of you who have been diagnosed with breast cancer or who may be facing that diagnosis.  My thoughts and prayers are with you. As you may be able to tell from my screen name, I work for a radiology billing company.  Our group physicians are the owners of the corporation and have a joint venture with an breast MRI center.  Needless to say, my office provides the billing service for the breast MRI facility.  Every single day we face denials from insurance companies for the MOST ABSURD AND RIDICULOUS REASONS.  And every single day we work diligently to appeal the denial decisions on behalf of our patients.   Believe it or not, there are actually some insurance carriers out there who do pay without a fuss. Unfortunately, some of the larger carriers - BCBS in particular - seem to cook up any excuse possible to not pay for the services.  Obviously this is not news to you or this topic wouldn't even be posted.  =) Now, here's the kicker with BCBS...THEY WILL NOT PRE-CERTIFY OR PRE-AUTHORIZE THESE SERVICES (or any, for that matter).  Basically, you just take your chances - have the service and then cross your fingers and pray like crazy.  If you do have BCBS - any plan within the Blue Cross group - I would strongly recommend you start by taking the following actions before you have your MRI: 1.     Get copies of all of your relevant medical records (anything indicating a previous breast cancer history, record of family history, most recent mammogram(s) and ultrasound(s), and biopsy [if applicable]) and a statement from your physician setting forth his/her reasons for deeming the MRI a medical necessity. 2.     More than likely the breast MRI facility will be aware of the denial issue.  But, to err on the side of caution, tell them that you are aware there may be a problem and make sure the breast MRI facility - or billing office - has copies of your relevant medical records and physician statement.  Ask them to file a PAPER CLAIM (do not send the claim electronically) and attach copies of the medical records you provide, as well as the MRI report itself.   3.     Ask them to please point out in a cover letter the areas in the attached medical records that show your risk factors (previous history, mammogram results, ultrasound results, biopsy results, physician statement).  Ask them to be specific - \"...on page 2 of Mrs. Brown's ultrasound report dated March 1, 2008, the impression is that of (whatever it may be)...\" \"...on page 2 of Mrs. Brown's mammogram report dated February 25, 2008 the impression is (whatever it may be)...\"  and so on and so forth.  I know this may seem to be a little much to ask, but hey...if it works, it IS their bill that will be getting paid.   4.  Ask them to provide you with a copy of what is submitted to the carrier.  (This way you know it's done like you asked...and you have your own copy in the event you need to file your own personal appeal.) I am suggesting these things because this is the new approach my office is taking with our ladies who are in the same situation.  And guess where the suggestion came from...A letter sent to a patient from BCBS in which they indicated that while they don't do predeterminations or preauthorizations, it would be beneficial in evaluating the claim for medical necessity if the records were attached to the claim.  Again, that letter went to a patient and those suggestions have never been sent to us directly.  I figure the reason for that is they don't really WANT the billing agents to know.  I also believe they really hope that the billers (whether it be a service or the physician/facility itself) will just send a claim, get a denial, and then transfer the balance to the patient for payment because the services weren't medically necessary or were \"investigational\" or \"experimental.\"   DEFINITELY FIGHT THE FIGHT!  And to whoever (forgive me for not remembering because I read so many posts) had the idea to ask for the medical license and credentials and so on of whoever makes the determination to deny service:  THAT IS CLASSIC AND BRILLIANT!!!  In fact, I plan to start checking on that myself for our local \"reviewer.\"  Just wish I had thought of it myself!  My hat's off to you! Oh...and another thing...make sure you know exactly how your MRI will be billed before you go in.  And it's perfectly fine to call the facility and ask.  What I mean is, does the facility bill everything globally (which is the technical component and professional components together) or do they bill the technical component and another separate billing service bills for the professional component?  (In case you don't know, the technical component is typically what the facility charges for \"taking the image,\" use of staff, equipment, etc.  The professional component is the charge made by the radiologist who reads and interprets the MRI and then makes the report of his/her findings and diagnosis.)  If it is a global charge, find out what the total charge is (what is billed to the insurance carrier AND what your private pay discount total would be).  Make certain there are no other charges associated with the service.  If the technical and professional are billed separately, ask for each charge amount.  (They may have to refer you to the service who handles the professional component billing for that charge.) Someone also posted something about asking about a cash discount if your insurance doesn't pay or if you don't have insurance.  PLEASE do this.  I know we will reduce our fee for those who don't have coverage - and we don't require full payment up front.  We feel that our ladies already have enough to stress out about.  If they can pay it all up front, great...if not, we're happy to work with them.  I hope that any medical group working in this particular field will have a great deal of compassion and understanding and will do the same.   If the facility where you are planning to have the MRI isn't very accommodating to your requests for assistance (either with claim submission and appeals or discounts and payment plans), you can always go elsewhere.   Above all, please don't deny yourself the service.  It may be tough to have yet one more bill to take care of, but in the grand scheme of things, this is one bill that is worth it.  You will have either received what is hopefully an early diagnosis, or - more hopefully - found out that whatever suspicious spots that showed up on screening tests were nothing more than just that...spots.  Either way, it's good to know - early intervention or peace of mind.  Both are invaluable. One of my goals is to find ways (which for me means bugging people to no end - the media, insurance executives, Senators, Congressmen...the President, whoever) to make this a VERY public issue and to see what can really be done to get the stone age carriers to pay for these tests.  In the meantime, I am going to exhaust all means and travel all avenues with the carriers themselves to figure out what actually works to get claims paid.    I will keep you posted with any new discoveries!   Blessings to you all!",

Members and their providers have the responsibility for consulting the member's benefit plan or contract to determine if there is any exclusion or other benefit limitations applicable to this service or supply. If there is a discrepancy between a Medical Policy and a member's benefit plan or contract, the benefit plan or contract will govern. Coverage: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the Breast (BMRI) may be considered medically necessary as an alternative to screening mammography in the following: * Patients considered to have a family history suggestive of hereditary breast cancer (multiple first-and/or second-degree relatives with breast, ovarian, or colon cancer; OR * Patients with a known BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 mutation; OR * To screen the contralateral breast in patients who have known breast cancer. BMRI may be considered medically necessary for diagnosis or detection in the following: * To evaluate the breast in patients with adenocarcinoma involving axillary nodes but with mammographically normal breast; OR * To determine ipsilateral tumor extent, and/or the presence of contralateral disease, in patients with newly diagnosed, clinically present localized breast cancer; OR * Before and after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, to evaluate chemotherapeutic response and the extent of residual disease prior to surgical treatment; OR * To further evaluate suspicious clinical findings or imaging results that remain indeterminate after primary screening test results (mammography, breast ultrasound, biopsy) and physical examination are inconclusive for breast carcinoma or when these studies cannot be performed; OR * To evaluate suspected breast cancer recurrence in patients who have undergone post-mastectomy tissue reconstruction with tissue transfer flaps or implants; OR * To evaluate suspected breast cancer recurrence in patients with a prior history of breast cancer and inconclusive mammography, ultrasound and clinical findings. BMRI is considered experimental, investigational and unproven for all other indications, including but not limited to: * As a screening technique in average risk patients; OR * As a screening technique for the detection of breast cancer when sensitivity of mammography is limited (such as, dense breasts, breast implants); OR * For evaluation of low-suspicion findings on conventional testing not indicated for immediate biopsy and referred for short-interval follow-up; OR * To diagnose a suspicious breast lesion in order to avoid biopsy; OR * To further characterize indeterminate breast lesions identified by clinical exam, mammography or ultrasound when a biopsy can be performed; OR * For evaluation of residual tumor in patients with positive margins after lumpectomy; OR * To differentiate cysts from solid breast lesions; OR * MRI of the breast that does not use scanners equipped with breast coils, regardless of the clinical indications. BMRI to identify the status of a breast implant (regardless of breast implant age) placed for cosmetic reasons or for augmentation unrelated to breast cancer may be considered a cosmetic exclusion and will be subject to benefit limitations. Codes: CPT Codes: HCPCS Codes: 77058, 77059 , 0159T None ICD-9 Diagnosis Codes: ICD-9 Procedure Codes: 174.0, 174.1, 174.2, 174.3, 174.4, 174.5, 174.6, 174.8, 174.9, 175.0, 175.9, 196.3, 198.81, 233.0, 611.72, 996.54, V10.3, V16.0, V16.3, V16.41 88.97 Description: MRI is the use of a magnetic field and radio waves (instead of radiation) to produce detailed, computer-generated pictures of organs, body areas, or the entire body. BMRI can be performed using magnetic resonance (MR) scanners and intravenous MR contrast agents. Specialized breast coils are used to enhance the test outcome, which allows for bilateral breast imaging and greater differentiation of varying breast tissue. The patient is in a prone position with the breasts hanging through a cutout in the table. When MRI-guided biopsy of a lesion is planned, the patient may be positioned on her side to permit easier access to the breast for biopsy. The MRI-guided breast biopsy is accomplished using MRI-guide compatible needles and localization equipment. BMRI may also be called magnetic resonance mammography (MRM). Regarding risks of inheriting the susceptibility to breast cancer and use of BMRI, patients are evaluated for alterations or mutations in two genes, BRCA-1 and BRCA-2. These patients are of families suspected or confirmed as: * Having hereditary breast cancer, * Occurring at an early age, * In multiple generations or multiple first-degree relatives, * Occurring bilaterally, and * Occurring in a pattern suggesting an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance (consistent with a high probability of harboring the breast cancer gene). Families at high risk for harboring a BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 mutation are those in which the incidence of breast cancer is found in first- or second-degree relatives, about half the family members are affected. The susceptibility may be transmitted through the maternal or paternal side of the family. The identification of BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 mutation makes it possible to test for abnormalities in these genes and gain information on the future risk of cancer. When faced with the risk of inheriting the susceptibility to cancer, patients with a positive test, a family history of breast cancer, or family members having a confirmed mutation of the BRAC-1 or BRAC-2 gene, may consider management options, such as BMRI. Rationale: This policy regarding BMRI as a screening and/or diagnostic (detection) tool was primarily based upon several Blue Cross Blue Shield Association (BCBSA) Technology Evaluation Center (TEC) Assessments (BCBSA TEC Assessment). Screening Uses: For patients who are at high genetic risk for breast cancer - based on 2003 BCBSA TEC Assessment: * When applied to high genetic-risk patients, the evidence appears to show at least equivalent performance for MRI in terms in sensitivity in detecting breast cancer compared to mammography. In the studies reviewed, MRI detected 100% of cancer cases, while mammography detected 33%. * When applied to average-risk patients, the direct benefit of MRI screening among this population has not been proven. Because the prevalence of breast cancer is extremely low in average-risk patients, screening with a test such as MRI that has inferior specificity would result in lower positive-predictive values and many more false-positive results. Compared with mammography, there would be greater numbers of workups, biopsies, and morbidity if MRI screening were to be applied to average-risk women. For patients who have breast characteristics limiting the sensitivity of mammography - based on 2004 BCBSA TEC Assessment: * When applied to patients with or without a prior history of breast cancer, evidence is insufficient to draw conclusions on the effects of adjunctive BMRI on health outcomes. * When applied to patients in the average-risk population, the incremental effects of adjunctive BMRI screening are uncertain. * When the sensitivity of mammography is limited in patients after breast conservation therapy, there may be improvements in sensitivity with BMRI; however, more prospective studies are needed to confirm this. For patients who have breast cancer and desire screening of the contralateral breast - based on 2004 BCBSA TEC Assessment: * Several BMRI studies were conducted at various times before, during, and after treatment of breast cancer. Most studies reported that contralateral cancers detected on BMRI were not detected by conventional testing, whereas in some cases BMRI was done to evaluate suspicious findings in the contralateral breast. Four of five studies reported a 4% to 9% prevalence of cancer in the contralateral breast using MRI, with one study reporting a higher 24%. The positive predictive variable ranged from 20% to 80% and specificity ranged from 76% to 97%. * A larger study of 212 patients with negative findings on mammograms on the asymptomatic contralateral breast found 12 cancers (5%) on BMRI. However the positive predictive variable was 20% and specificity of 76%. * When the positive predictive variables and specificity for BMRI have not been well established, more confirmatory studies are necessary to support the use of BMRI in screening the contralateral breast. Diagnostic or Detection Uses: For patients who have a suspected breast implant rupture which had been originally placed for cosmetic reasons or augmentation (unrelated to breast cancer augmentation or reconstruction), whether clinical conditions appear or not, BMRI is not a covered benefit, as the initial breast implant placement was a cosmetic augmentation procedure. All services relating to the post-cosmetic augmentation procedure, including, but not limited to BMRI, are not a covered benefit. For patients who have a suspected breast implant rupture which had been originally placed for breast reconstruction resulting from a mastectomy due to breast cancer, accidental injury, or trauma, BMRI would be considered a covered benefit as mandated by Federal Legislation. For patients who have a suspected occult breast primary tumor with axillary nodal adenocarcinoma when there is a negative mammography and physical examination - based on 2004 BCBSA TEC Assessment: * The adjunctive use of BMRI allows patients to avoid the morbidity of mastectomy in a substantial portion of patients (approximately 25% - 61%) compared to the risk of an unnecessary biopsy estimated at 8%. * The use of positive BMRI findings to guide breast conserving therapy instead of presumptive mastectomy appears to offer substantial benefit of breast conservation in true-positive BMRI. For patients who have posteriorly located tumors and determination of chest wall involvement is required - based on clinical studies: * The available prospective study of 19 patients with posteriorly located breast tumors suspected to involve the pectoralis major muscle based on either mammography or clinical examination, the presence of abnormal enhancement within the pectoralis major muscle on BMRI was 100% sensitive and specific for identifying five tumors that actually had invaded the chest wall. In the available studies, the results of the BMRI were compared with surgical and pathological findings. Prior to the BMRI and based on clinical examination, thirteen of the 19 were thought to be fixed on the chest wall. When based on mammography, twelve of the 19 were thought to have pectoral muscle involvement. * The available evidence from two other studies reported four cases in which BMRI was able to determine involvement of the chest wall with 100% accuracy. Given the high level of diagnostic accuracy for BMRI, as compared with reference standard and conventional alternative techniques, the evidence is considered sufficient to permit conclusions that BMRI improves net health outcomes. For patients who have suspicious breast lesions and further characterization is desired - based on 2000, 2001, and 2004 BCBSA TEC Assessments: * The available studies addressed a group of patients who have breast lesions of sufficient suspicion to warrant recommendation to undergo biopsy for diagnosis. Therefore, BMRI results are assumed to have an impact on the decision whether or not to undergo definitive biopsy, considered the gold standard. * The available evidence did not show that this use of BMRI would improve health outcomes. Considering the relative ease of breast biopsy, the sensitivity of BMRI would have to be virtually 100% to confidently avoid biopsy. While BMRI performs well, it is clear that the sensitivity is not 100%. False negative results tend to occur, particularly in certain subcategories, such as ductal carcinoma in situ, but invasive carcinomas may fail to enhance on MR, leading to false negative findings as well. The potential harm to health outcomes of failing to diagnose breast cancer or at least delaying the diagnosis of breast cancer is of significant concern. For patients who have low-suspicion findings on conventional testing not indicated for immediate biopsy and referred for short-interval follow-up: * The available evidence suggests that adjunctive BMRI may be very sensitive and specific in patients with low-suspicion findings on conventional testing and may provide a useful method to select patients for biopsy or to avoid prolonged short-interval follow-up. However, none of the available studies use prospective methods in the appropriate patient population to directly compare the sensitivity and specificity of short-interval mammographic follow-up with BMRI and to determine the effects of adjunctive BMRI on cancer detection rate and biopsy rate. * Well-designed prospective confirmatory studies would be necessary to permit conclusions regarding the effect this adjunctive use of BMRI has on health outcomes. For patients who have clinically localized breast cancer and preoperative mapping to identify multicentric disease is desired - based on 2000 and 2004 BCBSA TEC Assessments: * The available multiple studies confirm BMRI has a better sensitivity for identifying multicentric breast tumors compared to mammography and/or ultrasound. Approximately 2% to 15% of patients otherwise eligible for breast conserving therapy may have multicentric disease seen on BMRI. BMRI is primarily used to identify multicentric breast tumors that have not been detected on conventional testing using mammography, clinical exam, or ultrasound. * The effect on health outcomes of multicentric disease detected only on BMRI has not been established. If BMRI information is used to guide mastectomy, then the potential benefit of breast conservation will be decreased. The effects of multicentric disease on locoregional occurrence and survival have not been established after either breast conserving therapy with whole-breast radiation or modified radical mastectomy. For patients who have locally advanced breast cancer and require preoperative tumor mapping before and after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy - based on 2004 BCBSA TEC Assessment: * Compared with conventional methods of evaluating tumor size and extent (such as mammography, clinical exam, or ultrasound), BMRI provides an estimation of tumor size and extent that is at least as good as or better than that based on alternatives. One clinical trial found BMRI to be 100% sensitive and specific for defining residual tumor after chemotherapy. Conversely, mammography achieved 90% sensitivity and 57% specificity, and clinical examination was only 50% sensitive and 86% specific. * Using BMRI instead of conventional methods to guide surgical decision-making regarding the use of breast conserving therapy versus mastectomy would be at least as beneficial and may more frequently lead to the appropriate surgical procedure. For patients who have locally advanced breast cancer and require evaluation of response during neoadjuvant chemotherapy - based on 2004 BCBSA TEC Assessment: * The available evidence is limited to a few small studies with inconsistencies in outcome measures, reporting, and use of statistical comparisons. A total of six studies, including a total of 206 patients, performed BMRI during the course of chemotherapy. BMRI outcomes for response to chemotherapy were based on either reduction in tumor size or reduction in contrast enhancement. Three studies reported negative-predictive value (ability to predict a nonresponsive tumor) results of 38%, 83%, and 100%. However, the two lower estimates were from prospective studies, while the highest estimate was from a retrospective review. * Results are not consistent, and there is insufficient evidence to determine whether BMRI can reliably predict lack of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Ongoing clinical trials are pending. For patients who have positive surgical margins after lumpectomy and require evaluation of residual tumor - based on clinical studies: * Seven studies evaluated the diagnostic performance of BMRI to determine the presence of residual disease after prior biopsy or lumpectomy. Histopathology on re-excision was used as the reference standard. Most of these studies, including a single prospective study, reported poor sensitivity and specificity of BMRI for detection of residual disease. Two studies that reported more favorable results have methodological concerns that limit the influence of reported results. Three of the studies were conducted in the same institution and accrued patients during similar time periods, so overlap of reported patients may exist. * The available evidence is not sufficient to permit conclusions whether BMRI improves net health outcomes when used to identify the presence and/or extent of residual disease after lumpectomy and prior to re-excision.
