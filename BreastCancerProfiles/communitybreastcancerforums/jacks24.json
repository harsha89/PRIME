I'm also experiencing this on my nipple, so while I guess it's good it's happening, it sure doesn't feel good! I am going to the doctor tomorrow, so hopefully he can give me something to help with this! I have only had my expander filled once, and I feel like the pain is the same as before. I shouldn't need them in too long, so I'm hoping to get my implant in January.",

I am very uncomfortable on the expander side. Its cutting into my skin and is burning. No matter what I do, it just feels awful. The other side also has a burning sensation along my stitches. It all looks good, no signs of infection, but it hurts non stop. Any ideas what's going on? I'm guessing the expander will hurt until I get it exchanged for my implant... but the burning needs to stop! I also have burning/pain in my underarm from lymph node removal... anything to do for that? Thanks! Jackie Log in to post a reply",

Due to radiation, my surgeons would like to do the reduction to one breast at a time. Does radiation really cause breast tissue to look different than in the healthy breast? Am I wise to wait to have the second reduction done to ensure both breasts are the same size? Thanks, Jackie Log in to post a reply",
