ER+70%; PGR~10-15%; Cerb-B2(++), Ki pozitiv~10-15%. After being treated with only Chemo in Romania expecting the breast tumor to decrease in preparation for a future masectomy (Famorubicin,Ciclofosfamida, Fluorouracil) the cancer appears to have spread to bones... We are now in Istanbul, Turkey at Anadolu undergoing investigations, waiting upon PET-CT results as well as blood results. My questions: -is it possible to have a clear CT in July and then during Chemo to have the BC spread to bones? -would she eventually be eligiable for a masectomy? I would love to have an ideea about what possible treatment is available for this type of BC. The doctors in RO were not very open to different types of treatment and every time I would ask about hormone therapy (she is ER+70%) the doc said we will see about that...now 4 months later I had to take her somewhere else because i think she was not given the right treatment...  I have been reading threads on this website day and night since July and have to say you are absolutly fantastic!
