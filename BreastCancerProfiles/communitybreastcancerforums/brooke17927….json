I guess with the holiday though, there isn't much time for that. I'm not even really focused on Christmas because this is all I can think about, not really, but sorta, LOL. I am trying to stay calm and when I read things regarding calcifications being DCIS, it kinda makes me feel better, is that weird? I mean, I'm hopeful that worst case scenario would be a lumpectomy and radiation, I know that's still not good but I guess I feel like I have to mentally prepare myself. I have heard from another friend that went to the same breast center I'm going to, that it would be 2-3 days and new years eve would be the 3rd day sorta since my appt is at 9:45 Thursday.
