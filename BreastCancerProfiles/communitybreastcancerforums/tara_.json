They true to do direct to implant, but one side didn't look good so I woke up w/tissue expanders. Although I was glad they played it safe, boy was I shocked by my appearance. Had some significant pain after the surgery, and imagine my amazement today when my doc pulled the drain out and much of the strange contours -- and pain! -- disappeared. Grateful for that, and btw although I could see the drains all the way to the middle of each breast mound, I didn't feel it when they were pulled out. (The doc did a fill first, which he said would help.) I have started threads 2x here, and each time got the most helpful, kind and amazing advice and support. I haven't been good at interacting in real time, but I want to say a huge, huge thank you. We are so lucky to not have to face these challenges alone! Love, Tara Ps - I found a 3/4-sleeve top called \"post-op top\" on Amazon, which seemed kinda not-my-style & expensive ($70). Have to say, having a shirt made to accommodate the drains made all the difference for me...as did the silky kimono and long nightgown I treated myself to before surgery . It was important for me to feel pretty and cared-for as I recovered at home...just my experience for anyone who's facing surgery soon. xo!",

      "Content": "tara_ wrote: Hi everyone, Inspired by all the sharing and sisterhood here. Thanks in advance for your help... Wondering what to expect as I recover from my surgery next week. I'm having a BMX with (hopefully) direct-to-implant reconstruction. (I say hopefully because I had mantle radiation 25 years ago - the PS thinks we can go ahead with direct implants but we have to wait and see.) Qs for you: 1. How long will I need someone to be with me? Should I ask friends to be with me the 2nd week? [I have a daughter (almost 8) and a husband who's planning to take 1 week off from work.] 2. What was your pain like? (I know everyone's different, but still...) 3. How long before you could do simple things around the house again? 4. How the HECK did you do with being on your back for 2 straight weeks????? thanks. Log in to post a reply",
