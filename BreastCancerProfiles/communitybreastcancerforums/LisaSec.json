I went in for my simulation today and was told they could not do it because I have an area that became infected after my bmx and the wound has not completely healed.  I will go back on 9/10 for a \"skin check\" and if everything is good they will do my simulation at that time.  Then they will start my rads on 9/17.  I understand why they want to wait, but the delay is frustrating. Love & Hugs to you all! Lisa",

I have been told I will have 25 sessions. For me the difference in recurrence percentage was significant so my DH and I agreed that rads was the appropriate path.",
