We are scared for a reason ... 'a little swelling' may not be a big deal to them but it is huge to us and we want to exercise to reduce swelling not make it worse ... so LISTEN to us!   2.  Be flexible and willing to work with us.  Again, I think it goes back that we are all different ... we are all individuals and they may have to get creative ... it's not a one form fits all kind of thing.  I told a trainer I've worked over the last couple of years that I missed doing ab planks and she figured out a way that I could do them (in a modified way) with a ball.  Be flexible, be creative, be innovative.   Keep us posted on how it goes.  Such a blessing you have their ear.  ",

Too much. Way too much. It was almost two weeks ago and I'm still paying for it. I know better...but grrrrrrr. Swelling was better today than since I started the overload. My arm still hurts, though. I've done nothing with weights since then, only cardio and it hasnt seemed to help. I'm scheduled to teach at a youth camp this week, no air conditioning, hottest week of year thus far....I can't get ahead. I am going to hit the pool this week, though. How do you all keep up with housework? I think I'm going to have to hire a housekeeper. I can't do it anymore. I live by myself. No one to help. I feel so handicapped. Ugh. You all are an inspiration. I'm still training for a 6k in September. So far my knees are holding up. Doing a lot of interval and cross training. So...that is some good stuff. Thanks for letting me vent. I need to do more MLD. I so hate doing it, though.",

My big question for you is...what do you do with your stuff? Even the trips I've taken since LE, not flying, where I seem to get in trouble is in the carrying of luggage. I break it down in small pieces but it still adds up. How do you do it? Do you wear compression shirts or just a sleeve and glove?

I carry around a liter and a half thermos and at the very minimum make sure I drink that much water. Lower your caffeine intake if you're a heavy caffeine user. Watch what you eat...cut down on salt and any foods that have MSG, or preservatives or nitrates...those things cause inflammation. Walk! If you have a desk job, make sure you get up every hour (If you're drinking enough water you will have to do this anyway). Do the exercises that your therapist taught you, do them at least once every day. Hang in there. xo Others will have other things...but those are things you can do right now.",

They are also called 'barefoot shoes.'  The premise is that all the padding on running shoes throws off our natural alignment.  They don't have near the padding as conventional running shoes.  I find my stride and the way I walk is different when I wear those shoes ... my weight shifts from the back to the front.  I've had knee problems from running in the past and with these shoes it is much, much better.  The most I've worn them is to walk/run 2 miles.  But I had to work up to that.  Have yet to wear them on concrete or a black top but I've been amazed at the difference.  Nordy started a thread ... maybe it is on her running thread?  If you can afford to try them it is worth it if you've had knee/back problems in the past but the key is to break yourself into wearing them because for years, decades we've been wearing one thing ... have to ease into something different. They are also called minimalist shoes.  Here are some links describing them: http://us.mbt.com/Footer/Company/About-Us.aspx www.rei.com/expertadvice/artic...  http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/index.htm www.rei.com/expertadvice/artic... ",

I went to the pool 2-3x a week and did nothing but walk around in the shallow end and do my stretches that my therapists showed me to do.  Most of the time I was only in the pool 20 minutes - 30 minutes max.  I did absolutely no weight lifting ... the past year working up to 5lbs weights ... totally lost it ... did nothing weight wise for about 8 weeks.  I went to the gym 2-3x a week and at the least I did 20 minutes on the treadmill ... but most of the time I did 20-30 minutes on the elliptical and then maybe 20-30 minutes on the incumbent bike.   So ... I guess to sum it up ... I did cardio only and at that ... only about 25% of what I had been doing prior to the flare. And I did that for about 8 weeks.   My trouble is ... that my fingers always swelled when I walked prior to BC ... so I have had a terrible time gauging what is swelling from a flare and and what is 'normal' for my body.  I'm still figuring out what/how to do things.  What sleeves work better for weight training vs. cardio ... it makes me crazy at times.  I can wear my silverwave sleeve to walk in and do the bike ... but I need my juzo sleeve for any weight training.  Too much compression when I do cardio alone tends to make my swelling worse ...   Still trying to figure out that part ... hope this helps ... at least a little.  [[hugs]] ",

I will have been working out with a LiveStrong for two years in January. I'm averaging a new trainer about every three semesters. There have been a couple that I didn't like (they did not listen to me nor they really understand LE so I asked for a new one and got one). I think finding a good LiveStrong program that understands and works with LE is like finding an affordable, certified, knowledgeable LE therapist. I would not be where I am today if it weren't for the LiveStrong program. I've had to educate myself, stand up for myself...but isn't that the case with most LE related things? I have free access to a pool at the local university. Being able to get in that pool this summer was a lifesaver in the midst of that flare...there is no Y in my community and indoor pools are rare...LiveStrong has been HUGE in my recovery. I can't get in to see a therapist right now...but I do have this program... It is run by a professor of Kinesiology and I sat and talked with him in depth before I started about LE. He does get it. When I break in a new trainer into the LE world it takes a bit...but I hope I'm mentoring some therapists who will 'get it' when they start their careers in either OT or PT. LiveStrong has been a huge benefit to me...and still is one and a half years later...",

It makes such a huge difference in swelling...it shouldn't be that difficult...but I'm chronically not drinking enough water. I had someone get on my case at Thanksgiving for drinking Perrier water...my go-to when I get sick of drinking plain water. She said the fizz was bad for your bones and you'd be more likely to get Osteoporosis??!! Is that true? Anyway...whatever...but it IS expensive and so I was thinking this week on what I could do to help me get enough water. The last few days I've brewed some herbal tea called 'Rooibos' or Red tea...it's from S. Africa, it's caffeine free, and it is full of antioxidants. I mix it with some hibiscus and it makes a lovely brew. :) You could probably find it in the health food section of your local grocery store. It's cheap and it's supposed to be good for your skin. I buy it in bulk from republic of tea...but again you could probably find it at your local grocery store. It is an acquired taste but you can mix it with honey until you get used to it. It's really helped my swelling go down...and it is supposed to relax you too...which we probably all could find useful during the holidays. www.republicoftea.com/cedarber... I had a great work out with my trainer today. I moved up to 4lbs today for bicep curls...so far I'm doing ok. Tomorrow will tell the tale, though. Keep working out, ladies! :) xo",

I'm seeing a chiropractor who specializes in sports injuries http://www.activerelease.com/what_patients.asp He came highly recommended from a collegue of mine who runs marathons.  Three weeks ago while on the treadmill I had excruciating pains shoot down the left side of my knee.  I tried to run through it and couldn't.  I finished up 20 minutes on the elliptical.  And felt OK the next day but knew something was wrong. I've been seeing this guy for a couple of weeks now.  It's been painful but slowly getting better and today he laid into me ... deep hip, back and yikes ... I wasn't going to the gym today but felt like I needed to stretch and do at least a little something.  Did a lot of stretching and about 10 minutes on the elliptical.  He told me I could do anything except run right now. Anyway .... I didn't think about it until today (duh??) ... could him breaking up scar tissue in my left knee cause me to flare in my arms?  ",

Repeat on the other side.  She has me doing 3 set reps of 10!   Whew!  Kills my quads but it also is working the core because you have to balance and then kicking the leg out to the side, of course, is working the hips.  Today, she modified it a little and had my standing leg on the bosu ball bent and made the squats lower and deeper.   Make sense?  I hope so.  I've never done this exercise before and I don't know what they're called.  She also has me doing modified plies (the ballet move) with feet really wide (toes facing opposite walls), hold a five pound weight squat as far down as I can do, drop the weight, tilt the hips back (pelvis straight, not bent over) go straight up, bend deep, tilt pelvis down a bit to pick up the weight, straighten, then go back up ... hips are constantly working ... never worked them this hard in my life.   Here's  what a bosu ball looks like for those who don't know: http://www.bosu.com",

LE is so individual that what one can do with no problem may cause a flare in another.   Here is a resource for trainers but I've found it helpful to read through for myself concerning exercise: stepup-speakout.org/Trainer%20...            And here is a more general one on exercise: http://stepup-speakout.org/Exercise_and_lymphedema.htm Personally, I cannot do either down-dog or planks in yoga.  My primary problem is in my hands and fingers and any pose that puts pressure on my hands is bad for me.  Some ladies with LE can do them but I can't. I started with 2lb weights for bicep curls but I had been lifting weights before BC so I wasn't starting from scratch.  I had worked up to 5lbs but had a horrible flare last summer due to extended time out in the heat (over 100 degrees) and I haven't gotten back up to that weight since.  I fluctuate anywhere between 2 and 3 lbs on bicep curls.  The goal is to start off extremely light and work up s-l-o-w-l-y.   The key is to do things that help the LE and not make the swelling worse.  If you do something that causes you to swell, back off.  If you lift a certain amount of weight keep it at the same weight for at least 2-3 weeks before moving up, one pound at a time.   Welcome to this thread.                                                                    ",

Unlike the circulatory system, the lymphatic system doesn't have a pump (heart) and water helps flush things out, as well as cardiovascular exercise. That's also why MLD is important...it moves the fluid along. I'm serious about the Rooibos (Red Tea). Check it out if you haven't tried it. It's rich in iron too.",

I enjoy it and it relaxes me.  Exercise has to be fun or we won't keep doing it ... that's why it's really important to find something that you enjoy doing ... or you won't keep doing it.   I was at an 8 hour seminar yesterday and I walked for at least 10 minutes every break and during the 45 minute lunch break, I walked for 20 minutes.  I did it because I ENJOY it and it helps clear my head.  Whatever you pick for exercise ... again ... do something you enjoy.  xo",

I too see the clear image of that bug on his back with his legs wiggling in the air. #sigh# I'm not having a good week ... was in bed last night hurting so badly ... trying to figure out what I had done wrong. I went hiking on Tuesday, a rough one, through brush, under fallen trees, up steep banks, it was cool so that wasn't the problem. There was one point when the person I was walking with almost fell and she reached out and grabbed my hand and she pulled on it. At the time I thought, \"uh-oh.\" It was the first time since my surgeries that I've had anyone do that. I was concerned but then forgot about it. I've been incredibly swollen since then. Last night I just hurt. Today it is better?! That is one of the things I absolutely hate about LE. I think it is weather related. It was 90 a couple of weeks ago and now it is 50. I'm thankful it is better but I hate the drama of it all...you do everything \"right\" and it isn't enough. Hugs to you, Tina. If it is any comfort at all...I too have been a wiggly upside down bug. xo",

Not sure the side lunges would be best for you since you have that lower lumbar injury.    Definitely don't want to aggravate it and that stretch might?  I have to go to my 'happy place' at about minute 7.  Shut everything out and just focus on breathing.  It really is amazing to me ... how everything is connected.  Gotta have strong hips to have healthy knees ... never knew the importance of that before.  But it does make sense ... everything in our bodies is connected to everything else.  Had no idea how weak my hips were ... until I've started to strengthen them.  Kind of like back pain for me ... when I started strengthening my abs and core (started doing Pilates about 5 years ago) my back pain went away.  Amazing.",

I'm extra focused on it since I can't do other parts of the class.  Guess it's paid off?   Edited to add: Try lunges on the bosu ball.  Your guy will totally go for that!  That's a good step to work on your balance.  Take your front leg in the lunge and place it on the bosu, opposite leg back, switch legs ... that works your balance and it works your core too. Found a video: http://www.weighttraining.com/exercises/bosu-ball-lunge Here is a video on bosu squats: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr1XeaievVM http://corestrengthblog.wordpress.com/2013/04/30/bosu-ball-squats/ You can do the squat on either side of the ball.  I've done them both ways.  The way he does it in the video is harder IMO. Final link on bosu ...   Some of the images are no no's for us ... but some of these will give you an idea of what those side kick squats look like and could give ideas to your trainer to shake things up a bit.   bosu side kicks    (can't get this link to work.  I googled 'bosu side kick' and amongst the first links was 'images' and that's the link I wanted to post.  Hopefully ... you can get there.)  Click on \"images of bosu side kicks\" when you click on the link.",

After I developed LE I continued to try but found it ALWAYS made my swelling worse. I haven't gone in about a year because it was so depressing. All I could focus on was what I couldn't do anymore and it took me to a very dark place emotionally. I went for the first time last Wednesday. I know I cannot do down dog but I tried a modified version and guess what? Swelling. Even with my knees on the floor, hands down...I still swell. :/ So I'm the same way. If I let it, it really gets me down because I was so strong before...and now I'm not. I mean, really, it sounds so simple...hands down...feet on the floor...why shouldn't we be able to do that? My next option is try a Thai Chi class. I love the easy, flowy movements, the breathing. I haven't tried a 100% Pilates class since LE. I so loved it before...I honestly think I'm a little afraid to try for fear I found out that I cant do it either. I don't mind hand washing the garments. Just put a little warm water in the sink with a lingerie wash, swish it around and let it soak 15 minutes...easy peasy. I'd take hand washing garments to MLD anyday. ;p I hate it. Talk about a PITA..... GmaFoley - Do what you can is my advice. Keep it simple. I'm thinking about buying a little trampoline to keep in my bedroom....jiggle that fluid right out of my fingers. :D Get a video and do 15 minutes of whatever type of cardio you like...the ladies have talked about a Sansone (sp?) video. Just do something. Keep it easy. Keep it enjoyable or you won't stick with it. ((hugs))",

I am going to succeed in not writing a book but you all may well think I'm crazy but that's ok. ;) Here goes: I'm a huge St. Louis Cardinals baseball fan. If you follow baseball at all you know the fairytale ending to last season. They were completely out of it in August and then they come back and win it all in true Hollywood fashion. It was unbelievable! Their winning the World Series was a huge turning point for me. I had been in such a deep, dark hole... felt completely hopeless regarding all things LE...like this beast was going to conquer, control, take away every vestitide of joy...I was destined for a life of misery. Their winning ... was a turning point...if they could come back and win ... I was not going to let LE beat me. I don't know how else to say it ... Just a huge turning point. I found out this Spring that they were having a Cardinals Care 6k Race to benefit needy kids in STL and I just knew that I was supposed to do it. One of the unexpected consequences of working out with my LiveStrong trainer has been that we've had to focus a lot on lower body, especially in the beginning since I could do nearly nothing with my upper body. We've done lunges, squats, moved up to pylometrics (sp? Dynamic, jumping, power moves). I was a runner during high school and college but had to quit with some significant knee issues. I thought I'd never run again. But I was doing all these dynamic leg exercises, do I dare try? The Cardinals 6k gave me the incentive to try. It's been a frustrating summer because it's been so blazing hot, then I had that flare in June and didn't do much for several weeks...but I did it, ladies! I did it! BC, LE left me figuratively beaten, bloodied and knocked out in the ring but with the help and encouragement of so many ... You all included, I've gotten up, and I'm back in the game. Running that race was huge. And I am so, so happy! Two years ago I was in chronic physical pain with a recent LE diagnosis. Never would I have thought at that time I could ever run a 6k. My running days were over. So I thought. ;) TinaT - get those running shoes out, do your stretches and get ready to run! :) All you ladies inspire me. There is hope in the midst of all this crap. There is light in the darkness. So thankful.",

I've learned over the years what is part of exercise and what is injury pain. With our bodies having gone through trauma, we need to be extra cautious now. I had tissue expanders and then exchanged for implants. My LE OT suspected that my TE had rested on my ulnar nerve. It hurt to walk for exercise for months after my exchange. That's when I started using as my main mode of exercise the bike where you sit down with your legs out in front of you...called an incumbent or recumbent bike. Maybe the kindest thing you can do for your body right now is REST. Let it heal. Let the irritation in your breast go down a bit. Even elite runners will take days off. Take a day off, maybe two or three or even a week. After a day, do some gentle stretching. 6.5 weeks out from my surgery...I could barely walk the block I was hurting so badly.

You could do the opening every day but doing the entire thing every day \u2026 is too much. You need to give your arms a chance to rest. Be careful too with the resistance (stretchy) bands. There really is no way to measure how much weight you're pulling \u2026 and we need to measure it carefully so we know we're not doing too much. I had a really bad flare in the summer of '12 and I've never gotten back to using 5 lb weights. I'm using 3 or 4 lbs, depending on the week. Using those bands, you're likely pulling more than that. Again, being in the middle of a flare \u2026 you need to be super careful. Slow and steady \u2026 even though it can be super frustrating!

I did, however, switch to organic only milk. Well ... this past week I ran out of cereal and money is super tight and months I had bought Kashi waffles on sale and stuck them in my freezer ... this week I pulled them and that's been my breakfast.  I have noticed a substantial reduction in my swelling when I stopped having milk everyday.  Obviously, I am NOT lactose intolerant but it has me wondering ... if milk could be a variable in my swelling.  Last night I had a glass of milk before I went to bed ... and this morning my fingers were really fat? Anyone else have a similar reaction to milk or thoughts?  If drinking milk is going to have that much of a difference in my swelling ... I will cut it out.  Maybe a glass a week but not everyday.  Nothing else has changed in my routine or eating habits ... just the milk.  ???  Also ... I think the MLD does better for me if I do it in the morning instead of at night.  ",

Quick check in: On Monday after the race I was walking like an elderly woman. When I got home that night, I went to the gym where I did 10 minutes of easy cardio on both the elliptical and then the bike.  I felt much better when I got home and I felt good enough on Tuesday that I met with my trainer.  He was easy on me ... but it was good to work out the soreness. The only lingering effects of the run is that my right knee is a little cranky.  I worked out again with my trainer today and it feels good right now. I've found stretching is a key for me with my knees (as it is too with the LE).  So, while I miss my yoga class, I'm learning good stretching exercises that are good for my knees ... so now with the crazy Lebed lymphatic opening ... I have about 15 more minutes of stretching for my bottom half.    It really does help with the soreness and the knee crankiness.  Oh, I almost forgot ... I was a cross country runner in high school and college.  One of my very favorite things to do when I could run was to run through a forest.  I love everything about it ... the quietness, the smell, the sounds ... I had a dream last night that I did just that.    I haven't had that dream in over 20 years.  It's made me whole day.   ",

The sky was that clear, bright blue that Autumn brings.  The air smelled of hay. The crickets and the frogs were singing. I walked down the easy, curvy country road.  I saw a couple of deer.  A bunny jumped out of the bushes and hopped away ... all I could see was the white, fluffy tail.   The crisp air felt sooooo good!  I wanted to skip, run a little but needed to take it bit easy after my hike and run yesterday.  I did a couple of miles and circled back to my car.  It was dusk but decided I wasn't done.  I picked up my mp3 and put the earphones in my ears. I made a running mix for the race on Sunday but decided before the race that I didn't want to bother with it.  I wanted to absorb every aspect about the race and not tune anything out.  I started off down the road again and saw a couple of more deer standing off the road.  A fairly big buck ... six point maybe ... and a doe standing in a field with horses nearby.  I walked down a hill and ah, yes, the country dogs that come and nip at your heels.  A hand to my side was all they needed and they backed off.  I walked up a hill, around the corner and the stars ... it was a clear enough night that you could see the stars on the horizon.  I turned around and started back towards my car ... and there was a half moon in the southern sky.  As I got closer to my car and the lady on my phone kept shouting out my time and my pace ... I realized even more what a miracle last Sunday was.  Tonight I was averaging a little bit more than 16 minutes a mile.  Last Sunday I was averaging about 12 minutes a mile.  Did I have angels wings?  There was a time when I would have lamented a 12 minute mile and been embarrased. Now, it is a miracle.  I'm still in awe of how far I've come.   As dusk turned to night and I was alone on the country road I felt so free!  Had no idea how much like a caged bird I had felt this summer ... so hot, so cooped up ... I no longer cared about babying my knees... I began to skip ... then I began to dance.  Yes, I did!  I danced down the road for joy.  I've spent so much of the last two years in the land of grrrrrrrrrr....so many tears, so much hopelessness, so much despair, so much banging my head upon the wall ... as I listened to the songs on my mp3 ... I realize more than ever before how far I've come.  My heart is so full.  I really feel like I've turned a corner ... and I don't want to live anymore in the land of grrrrrr.  I think I'm moving on, ladies ... and for that I am so thankful ... and you all are a big part.   <3",

It is informative in a beautiful, creative kind of way. It is powerful. It is profound. It shares the effects of LE without being self-pitying.   It also conveys that we are conquerors and while our lifestyle is inhibited it isn't completely crippled. That. my dear, is brilliance.

First, the driving.  I did too much after my exchange and paid for it with pain .... I moved three weeks out and did a lot of reaching.  About six weeks out, I drove 120 miles (total trip 240 miles) every week for the Fall semester to attend a class.  The driving totally exacerbated the pain and the LE in my fingers. While driving, your arms are outstretched and driving 70 miles could be an issue.  Recently, I drove up north, a 7 hr one way trip to see some friends.  And when I got there, I was really hurting!  Haven't hurt that bad in months.  Driving home, I tried something different ... I had the seat very close to the steering wheel, so my knees were right up there with it, and I rested my arms on the steering wheel, so they were not outstretched and when I got home, I didn't hurt.  My knees, a little, but not my arms!    So ... I know it's a minor thing in all of your issues, but could you change the position in your arms while you drive?   Also ... I found yoga to be a huge part of my pain getting better.  Just simple stretches.  I attend yoga/thai chi/pilates class at my gym and while I couldn't and still can't do everything, it has and does help me a great deal.   I also found a video that is great for LE, but it's also good for regaining mobility after breast cancer surgery.  It's called, \"The Lebed Method, Focus on Healing Through Therapeutic Exercise and Movement.\"  Sherry Lebed Davis is the lady who leads it & she is a BC survivor who developed LE after flying.  Her brother, who is a MD, helped develop the exercise and it's been huge for me ... singularly the best thing I do for the lymphedema and it's also great in keeping flexibility in my arms and my pain level down.  I bought it on Amazon.com Also ... have you tried a PT or an OT?  One or your doctors can order an OT or PT for rehab and your insurance should cover it.  I had LE OT who performed myofascial release on me and while it hurt soooo bad when she did it and about an hour after, it was miraculous what happened to my flexibility pain after she performed that massage.  It sounds the massage you had was way too hard.    These are simple things that have helped me.  I pray you can find something that will help and someone who will listen and guide you in what you need to do and where you need to go. [[[[[[[hugs]]]]]]]   [edited to try & correct the weird format change, can't fix it, don't know why it happened.] ",

Like mycinnamom posted above, you have to start somewhere and then move from there. mycinnamon - Thank you for sharing your story.  So glad that although it's been long and hard, you're getting help.  That is encouraging and it gives others hope!  Thank you!  [[[[[[hugs]]]]]]",
