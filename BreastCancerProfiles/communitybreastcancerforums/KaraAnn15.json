I am hoping its nothing I'm just concerned because she did not even mention infection at all, which I though was odd. She just seemed visibly concerned after she did the breast exam. Maybe I am just thinking too much into it. I have the ultrasound scheduled for this upcoming Tuesday and the surgeon appt. is on that Thursday so I'll keep you posted!",

      "Content": "KaraAnn15 wrote: I went to my gynecologist today because since about late December/early January I have been experiencing severe breast pain to the point where it is hard for me to do anything including walk up and down stairs, sleep, etc. I have also had many other symptoms such as brownish leakage, shooting pain, underarm pain, itching, etc in my right breast. Well, just the other day I found a lump deep in the tissue on my right breast (at about the 9:30 position). Anyways, when I went to the doctor today I was first seen by the nurse practitioner who took down all my info, asked about family history (my grandmother passed away from inflammatory bc and my aunt had a double mastectomy, she had IDC), and did a breast exam. When she got to that part of my right breast and my underarm area she said she thought she felt an area of dense tissue/a lump. She brought the doctor in also for a second opinion. She also felt it. They made me an appointment for an ultrasound and also an appointment for a consultation with a surgeon at the breast center. I am worried because she seemed concerned even though she was trying to downplay it. She said a couple of the lymph nodes under my arm felt hard also. However, they gave me that shame shpeel about how \"breast cancer doesn't hurt\" which I then replyed with \"really? because my aunt said hers hurt pretty damn bad\" to which she didn't have a reply. So my question is this: should I be concerned? They were very quick to refer me to a surgeon. Does this seem odd? Anyone with an experience like this? Thank you ladies! Log in to post a reply",
