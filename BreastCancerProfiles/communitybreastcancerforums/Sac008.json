Apparantly, my family is one of four known to carry this gene that is associated with three types of cancer (breast, ovarian, and cervical). My mother was diagnosed with breast cancer when she was 28, my aunt when she was 35, and both my grandmother and my other aunt have had preventative surgery soon after my aunt was diagnosed. Our geneticist runs tests regularly on me (being the only remaining female with natural breasts) and I've been told that I have a 95% chance of developing breast cancer by the age of 30. The surgeons and geneticist both advise that I have a mascectomy by age 25 and a full hysterectomy by 30. I am not upset at the fact that I have to give up my breasts, its something that I have known and grown up knowing I would be doing. I would, however, prefer to have the surgery now rather than when I am 25. I saw my family go through the surgery and I would personnaly prefer to have as few people know whats happening as possible. My main concern with the surgery is recovery time. I am very active, I play roller derby and its my life - its something I refuse to give up and I want to spend as little time off skates as possible. I will be doing the implants for reconstruction, but I have a few questions. I know that they take the entire breast off like concavely so, but do you lose your nipples? Do they reconstruct that? If so, is it the same? If anyone has had similar expericences maybe you could help me out a bit. Has anyone had this done around my age? Thanks. **I'm sorry if I don't use correct terms - I don't mean to be crass...just not quite sure how to explain everything!** Log in to post a reply",
