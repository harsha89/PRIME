Recently I had one done because of having swollen lymph nodes in the neck, it is now 74. Had CTÂ  scan, PET scan and biopsy done and found out that I have positive lymph nodes, how many I do not know. I had dbl mastectomy and 19 positive nodes removed in 2000, chemo, radiation, tamoxifin and femara and always wondered if there were any more floating around, guess there were.",
