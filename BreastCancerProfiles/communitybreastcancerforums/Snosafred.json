I have fibroadenoma in left breast. Need to check every 6 months. My question is,did anyone receive a normal biopsy but still wonder if it the biopsy was correct? Sounds weird I know. I was so afraid when I was told I needed to have a biopsy. I was very happy when told it was normal(I cried). I keep having this feeling that maybe they got it wrong. My mother tells me to stop worrying about it. The biopsy is normal Log in to post a reply",
