Your anxiety is certainly warranted considering you're adopted and have no access to your medical history. Of course you'd be anxious. I had an especially unprofessional experience with a radiologist who swished my core biopsy tissue around in a jar and told me I had nothing to worry about because he had \u201ctwenty-two years of experience\" and he knew \u201cwhat breast cancer looks like.\" Imagine my shock when he called me on my classroom phone later that week, in front of my students, to tell me he was sorry he was wrong and that I had breast cancer. Talk about a nightmare. All of this occurred when I found three palpable lumps less than two months after a \u2018clean\u2019 mammogram. Well, I did write to the CEO to file a complaint, not so much for me, because it was too late to make a difference in my case, but more for them to know how outrageous his conduct was in order to prevent it from happening to another woman. It's hard not to be angry about incompetence and disrespect and unkindness anywhere in the world, but it's especially infuriating when it happens in the medical community. Your feelings are valid. You deserved better. After you get an actual diagnosis, you may find your spirit will settle a bit and you will celebrate your tenacity and ability to advocate for yourself. I send you strength in the meantime. Tammy",

I will be thinking of you, giglgrl, nadine and Rebecca........texgal, I know where you're coming from, when I was diagnosed in January, my husband was unemployed (he finally found a job one week before my surgery, talk about grateful!)) and he had a broken leg from when a ladder collapsed while he was doing some work at my mom's house. So he  was in terrible pain, full of plates and screws and on crutches!  The couch barely cooled down from him before I was on it!  But life goes on.  I just keep telling myself that the universe will eventually realign and I trust that it will. Oh, yes.  One more question?  What are some opinions about having family members with you when you talk with the oncologist?  My DM has attended every one of my tests/appt.because she has wanted to be supportive.  My DDs ages 21 and 23 have been to many.  My DSs, 17 and 8, to none, as per my wishes.  My DH has been to all but one.  I am leaning toward just dealing with the chemo part with  my DH only.  I feel like they don't need to hear all this..... I don't want to hurt my DMs feelings and push her away.....but I feel like she has been through enough.......I really could use some help on this.....I don't know how \"down and dirty\" this appt. is going to be.....",

If anyone is still considering the Bisphosphonate trial: something to consider: when you become part of a trial, they follow you more closely for the first two years.  I found that to be a perk.  Don't know about you, but I felt very untethered when tx ended.   Everyone around me was congratulating me and saying,\"aren't you glad that's over, etc.  but I was feeling a little like a baby bird being pushed out of the nest for the first time:  \"I know I need to fly, but do I even know how?\" Lena, miss your postings - they always make me laugh!   Best to all......

Lena, I remember when I came home from the hospital with my \"drains\". My eight year old son began to cry. I asked him what was wrong (what I was really thinking was, \"what is right???\") He finally told me that before my surgery, when I had explained how I would look when I came home, he had pictured a drain, like in the bathtub, that would suck me away.

Last Neulasta, Titan, hurray!  Betsy, I swear I am ready to go without, just like you, only wish I wasn't so gray.  For any of you thinking about this biphosphonate trial:  I entered it because the way it was presented was basically that it could only help. I ended up on the Ibandronate arm and have been part of it for  over two months now.  I certainly am not trying to talk anyone into anything, that is not what we all are here for; but I would like to share that I am experiencing  no S/Es from the Ibandronate.  The most annoying thing is that you have to take it first thing in the morning, with a full glass of water, stay sitting upright, and not eat or drink anything for a half an hour.  That just gets some getting used to, and once you get into the habit, it is like riding a bike. I was told that this study has proven effective for stage 3 women and that is why they want to try it on lower stages.  The premise, as I understand, is to strengthen your bones, because if you do end up with a mestasis somewhere down the line, the bones are one of the first places it likes to go.  If your bones are strong (because of the biphosphonate), there is a lesser likelihood of the cancer being able to set up shop there.  You do have to visit and be cleared by your dentist before they accept you into the study, and need to stay in close contact with the research dept. to get more meds and for various observations, but all in all, my thought was: there is little that can hurt me here, and much that can help, not only me, but others who will find themselves in my position somewhere down the line.  If anyone wants to know anything more, I would be happy to share.   Has anyone out there who is ER+ and PR+ been given the opportunity to do an alternative to Tamoxofin?  Seems Tamoxofin has so many S/Es.  If any of you have moved into that \"part of the journey\", might you post your experiences?  Lesley, we are all still here.... waiting for you!  Have a great weekend, everyone!  Tammy",

I have no feeling in certain areas of of my upper arm, including my underarm. I have what has been referred to as 'tendonitis' in my elbow (which I never had pre-surgery). I have 'phantom' breast swelling and tenderness before my period, as I do on the 'real' side. (That's really weird!) I highly recommend seeing a PT to help you with your range of motion.

This obviously requires the memorization of lines, which was never a difficulty for me in the past, but is proving to be daunting now. I struggle with what I can only describe as \"empty spots\" in my brain, where I cannot find myself out. They are like gaping holes, once filled with exchanges of conversation between characters, but which now, are like being alone in a snowstorm. I sometimes am able to memorize the actual words, but often, fill in with words of my own choosing in a vain attempt to get the point across. I feel sorry for people on stage with me because I feel like I'm letting them down. So I make fun of myself. But no playwright appreciates anyone changing their words.... I was a teacher previous, but got laid off and decided to try my hand at acting again. I am a professional, so I can't be doing this! It's not community theatre!
