Five days of rads and I'm not even pink. That's a good sign, right? And remember when I said it smelled funny? I was right - my incision is infected. The funny thing was that I saw my breast surgeon before my radiation and told her I thought my breast was weepy and smelled funny; she looked at it and said 'No, looks fine, just stop putting any cream on it for a few days.' Then I went to radiation (literally ten minutes later) and the technician told me that there was a smell coming from the incision and it looked infected to her. After Rads I saw the RO who told me it was infected. WTF Breast surgeon? So I'm on heavy duty abx and cream over the weekend and they'll check it Monday morning to see if I can continue with rads. They wouldn't stop after 5 because of an infection, would they? Give me infection-fighting vibes so I can keep going on Monday! ",

I'm still wearing a regular bra during work without issue. My RO said the week after I finish may be worse before I'm out of the woods, but honestly, I've had it so easy. I was tired the first week but not since - and that may even have been the tamoxifen as I started it a few days before rads. Just wanted to share that so others just starting know what a wide range of experiences are possible. :)",

I also started tamoxifen on Friday, so it's hard for me to tell what is causing what symptom. I've been quite nauseous and tired since Monday but I'm guessing that could be the tamoxifen. My incision also seems to be weeping and crusty - is that a result of radiation ? I'm seeing my surgeon on Friday, so of course I'll ask her. And strange question, but does anyone else sort of 'smell' something while the machine is delivering the rads? It freaks me out, like I can smell my own flesh burning. Of course, it is probably just in my paranoid head ... ;)",

I feel a little like I am underwater or going through sort of a surreal out of body experience, but hopefully this will all be just a blip on my life's radar. Here is my situation. I get regular mammograms, my last one in May showed some clusters of calcium or something like that. Had a compression mammogram, still suspicious. Had Ultrasound - radiologist said 'much ado about nothing' so I was surprised to be called back for biopsy. Had biopsy - showed ADH cells. Met with surgeon who said she wasn't concerned but wanted me to do lumpectomy to be sure. Had lumpectomy on July 2nd. Had follow up appointment with Surgeon on Friday and it is cancer. My surgeon is not very communicative. She just said a 'small cancer' - I pushed for more info and asked her what type, etc so she (almost unwillingly) told me it was mucinous carcinoma - a rare but usually slow moving invasive cancer. My pathology report is going to the Tumour Board on Tuesday and they will decide action. She said I was Estrogen positive so would be out on tamixofen, and the board would decide if I need radiation and/or re-do the lumpectomy. I'm kind of lost. I don't know what to ask. I've been reading up (this board is awesome) but it feels like they are just going to 'tell' me what's happening. Do I have a choice? I guess it's my body, but shouldn't I leave it to the experts? I asked the surgeon if there is a chance that I have it in the other (left) breast and she was very dismissive - that they were not signs of that on the mammogram. I pointed out that they were surprised to find cancer in the right breast when they got the path results, so maybe it's in both. She didn't agree, so I guess that's good. I do not want this to be my life now - always waiting, always worrying, another lumpectomy, another biopsy. I can't deal with that. Maybe the board will meet on tuesday, say it was a clear margin and that I'll just start tamoxifen and monitor with mammograms yearly. But if they want me to do radiation and another lumpectomy\u2026 won't I limit my reconstruction options if it comes back? Am I crazy to even ask the question if I'm a candidate just to have a double mastectomy and move on? I can't believe all these words are part of my vocabulary now. I'm sorry for the ramble. I'm kind of lost. Am I overreacting? Any advice would be welcomed.

My MO wouldn't even have done the oncotype; she was comfortable going straight to radiation, but for my peace of mind, she ordered it. She said it would have to be very high for her to recommend chemo, so I'm just anxious to find out. I think if I don't hear by Friday morning I'll call the MO's nurse and get advice.

I'm feeling a bit calmer today and have spent the weekend reading as much as possible. I do think my surgeon is very to the point (and has very little communication skills) but I really trust my family doctor with my life so I called her today and had a grand chat. She is going to get all of my reports and I'm going to see her Thursday morning to get all the details of the cancer and to discuss everything with her in detail. I will feel a little bit more in control when I know the type, size, grade etc and get my Doc's feedback and benefit from her experience. I'm feeling much more positive, knowing that I will get the info I need in a couple of days - so I'll not panic until I need to. :)",
