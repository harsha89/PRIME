AS far as time off goes I did not have reconstruction.  I went to a conference for work two weeks or after Mx...I probably should not have but no one could tell otherwise.  I was back working in my home office with 3 -4 days and at office when back from conference.  I would get tired around 3:00-3:30pm  When I was home would get 45 min. nap traded nap for expresso when back at work.  You will go along for weeks and then just one day be tired.  I also pushed liquids to move all the meds out of my system. Breathe  My Bilat Mx was 5/1/09 and I am doing great.  Found a yoga program at the fitness center that is part of medical center and it has been great. Hang in there.  If you have direct question you can PM me.",

I only took pain Rx at night after 2 days, I also learned you will want to get an appointment to get your hair washed a few days after you are home.  It is hard to do so in shower etc but just having clean hair 3 days after Mx was so good.  As the nerves re-connect they can fell like hot wire on chest. It was worse in cold weather.  I went out of town to a conference 15 days after Mx....I really should not have done it, but no one could talk me out of it.  I get hit a wall abut 4 weeks of so out. Just tired, but I think I pushed too hard early. I found 3pm naps great and then had to replace them with 3pm expresso when back at office. Check with the medical center were you going...some have fitness centers. Local one here has free yoga classes for cancer patients. It helped with keeping my chest from tighting up.  If you have other question you can PM me.",

I had no reconstruction.  On 10/28 a great PS went in and did magic. I had developed a real hot point that triggered alot of pain.  PS revised the scar and removed extra tissue etc.  I feel great no more pain.  The hot wire is gone. I sleep on either side with no pain. I rolled over in the bed with out pain or waking up. PMPS is very real.",
