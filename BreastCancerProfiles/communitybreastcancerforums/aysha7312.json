I have been feeling intense pain in my armpits and breast specifically my nipples, which is persistent but at the same time not that often. I do get them in times of periods and when I'm not in my periods. My nipple feel sore and very painfully, mostly itchy. Sometimes when my armpit hurts, my whole arm is in pain too. Around the darker shade of my nipples, recently I've noticed pimple like scars. What do I do ? Log in to post a reply",
