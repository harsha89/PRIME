Jennifer, I too am having chemo first...finish up my last one Dec. 27th and then Surgery January 24th for a BMX masectomy. My tumor has shrunk that the doctor nor me can find it. But something is throbbing in there. Maybe it's nerves, I don't know. I just turned 53, married for 33 years to a very supportive husband. We have two boys, 23 and 27. Not married..23 year old lives with us again. I work in a middle school as the business clerk. I lost my mom to dementia a year ago and finally thought, now I can start living my life and then this happens. It's so surreal! But I would give anything for my mom to be here holding my hand now. It's amazing how many people have come out of the woodwork with breast cancer and reach out to me. You both are right, we all share a common bond and its great to be able to connect with people like you and share our ups and downs. I just had my third Taxol last week so not feeling the greatest. I get the neuropathy bad in my fingers and toes so they lessened the dose last week. Have a little bit of bone pain but not terribly bad. No nausea. I didn't have any SE's with the AC. Go figure! Almost done though! Yay!",

I believe your surgery was delayed just so you could help that lady overcome her fears. What a way to pay it forward! Peanutsgal. Thank you for sharing your story. I want to hear or read everyone's experiences, good or bad just to be prepared. I've heard that about the muscles clamping down on the TE'S. I wonder if anyone else is experiencing this. Hope your not nauseated anymore. Drink lemon ginger tea for that. Cinnamon. Good idea on the measurements. I must do that. Brandie. I think it's a good idea to take it out too. Better safe than sorry. Hugs to you all!!",

We all have been there. Believe it or not, it does get better. As soon as you have a definite plan in place, you will change tunes and begin the fight and become stronger. Maybe ask your MO for an anti anxiety drug. Most give Lorazapam. I also have been drinking Chamiolle tea at night which kinda helps too. You will still have emotional days, we all do, but not as much as you do in the beginning. You can get through this. Don't get on the Internet. Just stay with these boards.

My sisters flew in for the first 10 days to do all that, take me to follow up appointments. I was so out of it for the first five days that I'm thankful they were here! My DH had to work so I needed somone with me that first week. I had two drains which came out in a week. I slept in a recliner for 10 days especially with the drains in. I bought some camisoles with the drain pockets but didn't use them. I just pinned the god awful drains to my shirt and wore a button down shirt or jacket over it. I also got some button up the front Jammie's and wore a tank underneath. I'm still wearing tanks under my shirts. No bra. Put everything in your cupboards/fridge etc down to a level where you don't need to reach up for it. I stayed down for the first week as my dr. Didn't want me to move that much. They took three nodes out of me so I'm still sore there. I took pain pills regularly for the first five days and am totally off them now. I never had great pain but wanted to stay in front of it. I do take extra strength Tylenol and Advil together now and that seems to help my underarm pain. So the first week, i basically sat in the recliner, watching movies. for some reason, my vision was blurry as well. I think it was the flexerill, muscle relaxant. I started walking 8 days after surgery just 15 minutes. Now I'm up to 40 minutes. They really want you to walk as it opens up your airways. Hope this helps a little. Maybe someone else will jump in and give more advice.",

I'm finding that I want to plan and go and do and see sights that I haven't seen even in my own state. I work full time so on the weekends, we usually do housework and yardwork. But now, I want to take the time to appreciate the beauty of the world and most of all stop and smell the roses. But first have to get through the remainder of reconstruction. Ugh! Have you had any fills yet? I'm up to 300cc's but I think it's all in my throat. Erdwoman..I noticed your from Portland! I haven't seen very many people from the Northwest on here. We're did you have your surgery? I had mine at Good Sam. I'm not liking the TE'S either. But am glad I chose it.",

Tami...You deserve a trip to the sunshine states as well for putting up with the drain! So you are up to 450cc's now. I just have 300 in and go for another fill next week. I'm thinking two more fills will do it. I just hope I know when to stop with the fills. I just want to look normal and not have people look at me saying, wow, she's got a fake rack. I'm finally getting used to these TE's. I'm doing pretty good. Treated myself to a pedicure, at last, and manicure this week. Feels heavenly to have your feet rubbed especially with neuropathy in my toes. Went back to work yesterday. Didn't get overly tired. There were so many flowers on my desk. :) even came home and walked for 30 minutes. I feel as if I have turned a corner in all this madness. My attitude is changed as I'm feeling more positive that I am going to go on and live life as best I can! However, I do struggle with my memory. I don't recall conversations I've had very well. Yikes! And I'm not even drinking! Amy.... Hoping your doing well!!",

They have all seen me bald many times but I don't want them to see me like that right after surgery. I won't be looking my Sunday best and then with a bald head with one lone gray hair that has decided to sprout three inches while the rest is stubbly. Stupid, I know!!",

Told me to watch for fever. So we will see how it goes. Sounds like we have the same thing happening. I didn't get my fill which I sadly expected. Both my boobs, underarms don't feel right today. They hurt more than yesterday. Going to take a melatonin which the nurse lady said to do. Only 1mg as if you take too much, it keeps you awake. Have you ever tried the Kinseo tape for LE? My sister said it really works. You would have to ask your PS or PT. I don't understand why we have to go through all these other side effects too. Geez...it just doesn't let up!",
