I have just had a PET Scan which revealed 1.6 cm scar-like tissue in left breast,with faint FDG uptake. My oncologist is not concerned, but I am. Shouldn't I be healed? I have tenderness as well. The reason for the PET Scan was \"moderate tenderness to palpation, small tissue mass along 5th rib. He has diagnosed this a neuroma since it showed no uptake. I feel there should be no uptake at all, 2 years after radiation was completed. Log in to post a reply",
