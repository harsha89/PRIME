This past week with having the four biopsies done at once---i was at the imaging center for six hours and then finding out that they still want another with the MRI machine, i was (am) feeling really down about 1) going through all of this only to end up doing the mastectomy and 2) having to do this again in a few years when the next suspicious area is found.  It feels a bit like a game of \"duck, duck, goose\".........only \"benign, benign, cancer\"!  However, the alternative surgical option.....well, it sucks.  Please tell me that once i finally am able to make a decision and move forward that I will stop crying!  I feel like i am already in mourning and i haven't lost anything yet.  Thanks for a place to vent.  I really do appreciate all of your input.  Stay tuned.",
