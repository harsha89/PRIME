My left breasts has these red bumps all around my nipple and some of them look like scabs. The right breast has almost the same thing but there are less of the red scab/zit like bumps. They also have been very tender these past few days and I am very confused and I am too scared to tell anyone, including my mom, about what's wrong with me. I am scared it could be Inflammatory Breast Cancer and I just don't know what to do or who to tell what. Also these past few days I've had symptoms of a sore throat but that might just be a cold or something. If anyone could give me any advice I would really appreciate it! Log in to post a reply",
