Crying and worrying alot. My boyfriend is very supportive and said we really have nothing to worry about yet because we don't know anything yet. And when we find something out we'll deal with it then. So I'm trying hard to take his advice. Because I know deep down he is right. But I still can't help thinking that there is this thing growing inside of me. One more week to go. I hope this week goes fast. To all of you out there thanks for listening...you are the best!",

But Monday now is only two days away. Will be praying hard this weekend. My head has just been in the clouds. Or has my boyfriend said I was rattled in the head last night..LOL. I'll be glad when this over!",
