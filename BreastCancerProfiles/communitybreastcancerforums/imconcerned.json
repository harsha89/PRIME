I have an appt next week to see a nurse because i have a lump and sore right breast for 7 years (no insurance). I also feel really bad and everywhere aches. I'm 40 and never had a mammo. I also have swollen groin lymph nodes and what appears to be a swelling in my right side neck. Still my right breast hurts if i lay on it, and I thought BC wasn't supposed to hurt. Now there is a distinct lump aside from my otherwise lumpy breast. You aren't alone.",

My sister was checked for IBC because of months long itching and a much larger breast after her daughter was born. She even had \"puckering\" of her nipple. It turns out it was nothing, just a lot of hormonal changes. There are things to look for in IBC such as peau d'orange (which I think you can see if you press down on your breast), an inverted nipple, rash, open sore, bruise redness, heat, etc. If you don't have these things by now, you probably don't have IBC.",

The nurse felt a mass at 5 o'clock and told me that it was moveable and the size of a pea. She didn't know if it was a cyst. I honestly thought it was attached to the chest wall, but she felt it was in the breast tissue. Anyway the lump hurts which I've read can be a good sign. They also gave me a referral to get a mammogram. I'm not at all excited to go...in fact, I wonder the same thing about delaying. But, since i've had one sided breast pain this long, i'm not sure a few weeks or a month would make much difference.",
