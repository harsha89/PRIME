No one followed me up.  It says I have Birads 3 in right and left breast and I need a Surgical consult. I am not sure where everyone here is from maybe all over? I live in Florida now but from the UK.  I called the Imaging and they said that I should have been seen months ago and see a Dr but that was 6 months ago.  I feel very lost right now as I have severe disability and worried. I went online and searched and found this site Sorry Rosiesmom I seem to have gatecrashed here but please know I am reading what is said above and I have read the replies and good luck for tomorrow love Julie",
