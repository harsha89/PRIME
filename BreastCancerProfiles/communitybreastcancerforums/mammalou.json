Maybe484-I'm surprised your doc would just end your appointment without answering your questions.  How are you supposed to make an informed decision if she is ending your appointment? Wow. I am supposed to start Tamoxifen and I'm thinking I'll just start on August 1st.  Not much break, but why tease myself.  I'm a little nervous to see how I handle Tamoxifen, but I'm hoping for the best.  I already have so many hot flashes, so I can't believe that will get worse. ",

I took Tamoxifen for 5 years and I\u2019m on my 3rd year of an AI drug. I\u2019ve been having annual MRIs as my breasts are so dense. Just had a biopsy of remaining breast which was ADH and being scheduled for surgery to be sure that is all. I have read that ADH is usually estrogen driven. My concern is that the anti estrogen drugs I\u2019ve been on are no longer working and that has caused the ADH to develop. Does anyone know if ADH can be tested for estrogen receptors? My biggest fear, of course, is that my original cancer will spread to the rest of my body is my AI drug isn\u2019t working anymore.",

I was told chemo from the start so no choice there, but sometimes I wonder if I had enough! All I can say is, if you are going to second guess and worry forever, and at least some docs think chemo would be good, then I would consider it. Looking back and thinking you didn't do something you should have is terrible. Unfortunately, there is no way to ever know what is right so you just need to feel peace with what you do.",

I can say that I am glad I had it.  It just makes sense to me that you would want to take out nodes that have cancer in them.  There is a chance that none will have cancer and that is a risk you take.  There is a study out (Feb 2011) that says that there is no difference in survivial for women having the AND and those not.",
