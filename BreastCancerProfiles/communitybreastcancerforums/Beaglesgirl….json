The most important one is don't shun yourself! You keep faith in you! The strength that we need has got to come from within us... If you believe ask your higher power to walk with you if you don't then fill your mind with only positive. For me that has meant letting my relationship with my brother go as shallow as it can, I don't have the energy to fix it-him-us but I can minimize his role and save that space for only things or people who bring me emotional energy. You are all in the right place, the ladies here have much love and strength to share asking for nothing in return. Fill up and go face the harsh world and come back here... It's ok. Much love.",

I do not have nausea but have no interest in food so it's been tough to eat today. No headache and so far no stomach ache. I'm keeping close track on how it progresses since it's accumulative. But I was able to run an errand today and AC I didn't leave my room for many days! Congrats on this being your last week of AC!! I'm hopeful!",

Plils I hope you are feeling well after your surgery too- I agree about beating the cancer to the punch!  Tomorrow is my last day of Rads, I did it! Thank you all so much. I remember the night before my first chemo tx I had a blast of anxiety that somehow I would forget something- I got on here and realised that all they needed was ME to show up. We were all in this tiny boat of hope about to face this big storm together. We did, the storm sucked- some days we all had to turn our attention and faith to one person on the little boat because she was ready to jump but together we kept going holding hands and everybody stayed in for their duration.  I think about each of you on occasion. Wonder if your txs are going well or are over, always pray that the beast is at bay and that your spirits are high. Please keep in touch via my blog. send my your contact info or connect with me on facebook through it. I'll keep my oar on the wall to remind me to keep paddling, if not for me for the others on the boat. Love and Peace! ",

My career was over but I was not defined by it I was defined by my kids and dogs and my friends. It sounds impossible when your in the thick of it. 2008 when my healthy husband had a sudden cardiac arrest and died in front of our youngest child and then I suffered a massive stroke at his funeral I though I too would die of the pain. 3 kids, widowed, suddenly disabled, we lost everything.... We get up and rebuild one brick at a time. And I'll do it again after B/C is done knocking me on my ass.. Have hope in yourselves, the strength is within you... It's out instinct to survive.

Still, thank god for treatments- I'm triple negative and I was scared it wouldn't work because there are no 'after' treatment plans for my situation.    Right now I am recovering nicely and in fact my MO put me on Bio-identical hormones ( very light ones) to try and restore me a bit) after the hysterectomy I had in December. I know that within days I felt better. I see him next month again- he told me that because I've had a BMX, total hysterectomy and am triple negative this is the best route for my quality of life. But I guess there is no silver bullet to restore our sense of security. That comes with time and faith which we pick up a bit at a time if we are mindful about it.

I went to my chiropractor because i got a very bad headache and was about to drive from Denver to Missouri for the funeral and thought if he could help then my ordeal would at least be pain free. He adjusted my neck and started a process that I could never have known would change my life forever He damaged my carotid artery so when the kids and I got to the visitation I walked up with our 4 yr old and collapsed. Ultimately my massive stroke would happen after returned to Denver. fast forward 3 years later and much much heartache from that medical crisis- I got a letter awarding me ssdi a month before chemo. I don't know which one of those events flattened my spirit more- because while while becoming disabled is helpful financially its also a huge loss. I cried for days. Just kept looking up at the skies and begging no more please!

I had to go back to the tools I had really gotten good at during my most harrowing days during chemo.  I'm sure that this pain got out of control from me because my body has not had rest since I was diagnosed. Its likely that my lack of mental strength is starting to show. Surgery was Fri AM and its Sun AM and I feel like me again... like this is going to be fine. In fact I have my final week of rads starting on Monday and I will be there with bells on. So the skills we learned together here at our most painful moments in life will actually help us the rest of our lives. Maybe with our continued struggle with our health maybe in other aspects.

Plus I feel overwhelmed with fear with my first chemo tomorrow. I have had a serious case of self pity and I know I will only make this harder on myself if I don't snap out of it. Some of you ladies have such great attitudes - I admire that.",

Which means I was right where you are two weeks ago, and Xanax was prescribed which was ok but really didn't help all of the time because it made me sleepy. The only thing that helped was starting my treatment. It sounds odd, almost wrong but it was like jumping into the rapids and it was swim or drown... my focus now is getting through the chemo. I was consumed with the loss of my 'future' and now it really is just surviving this fight. I am sure that there will be a fall out when I have to deal with the future again. But for now, everyone that said when tx starts my anxiety at least would be better. I'm with you all the way!",

RIP Lisa.  I am so sad, this is such a sobering update. All we can do is to enjoy our lives and be grateful for every day we are given. I've remarried since but in 2008 I lost my husband of a sudden cardiac arrest- totally healthy man- we had three kids, one of which was with him at the park. We never know and we can't live in fear we should just live with joy and gratitude. <3",

Well- this week just stunk for the May '11 girls :( I had my 3 month follow-up with my MO on Tue and he scared me when he sent me downstairs for an urgent CT of my chest - all because I had a cough and some pain in my sternum. For 24 hours I planned my death... again then thankfully they called and said it was all clear! I am grateful for his swift action but it really is discouraging in my mental recovery. Also, my hip has also been in lots of pain for 6-7 months. I'm triple negative  so not on an anti-hormonals but I did have a hysterectomy in Dec. Also at same ill fated appt on Tue MO said \"I want you to have an MRI for the hip, it may be \"avascular necrosis from the chemo\"  what? another side effect? So I'm in the same bad hip boat Cyborg.  I did promise God that I would take the Femur surgery with no complaints if he spared me from mets when I was praying and crying all night waiting for my scan results.   Hoping for good news from your scan on Friday Cyborg and MamaV I don't know what to say about the bone loss other than what I tell myself everyday. Everyday we wake up is a Good Day.  I'll check for everyones updates next week.  ",

Laureen the cytoxan sinus headache didn't start until a couple of hours after I got home from treatment and it lingered for days the only thing that would touch it was vidicon. :( I can't find a happy medium for my belly problems it's either on full blast or off. I may just have to deal with that. Colace and miralax works but can't figure out the daily amounts. I still have no appetite or am naseus I can't keep losing weight, it can't be good.
