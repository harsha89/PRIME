      "Content": "Fab4 wrote: As you can see from my previous posts, I'm 40 yrs old, and have been having painful, burning sensations in my left breast, sensations of let-down, areola changes, and blotchiness that comes and goes. Had diagnostic mammo, it came back clear, except for right breast which was not the symptomatic breast. They did a US on RIGHT breast & said they believed I have a 7mm cyst---recommended aspiration. About 1-2 weeks later, upon feeling a long, hard lump/thickening inside my left breast, I called GP and she set me up for a MRI. This came back with an abnormal uptake in left breast (symptomatic breast), and she scheduled me for an US w/possible biopsy. Couple of questions: Will the radiologist do this biopsy? Should I be having a breast specialist performing the biopsy? Has anyone experienced a situation similar to this, and how concerned should I be? I've read a lot on BIRADS 4, and it appears that there is a 2-95% chance of malignancy, and most are benign, which is very reassuring, although it says if there is a palapable lump, it is definitely more concerning toward malignancy. I guess I also just want to make sure the appropriate medical professional is doing the biopsy. My appt is Wed, Jan 30. I just want to be as prepared as possible and make sure I've crossed all my 't's' and dotted my 'i's' :) I have no insurance, so i cant be duplicating biopsies & tests if at all possible! Had they US'd this sympotomatic breast in the first place, i probably wouldnt have to be going back again for another $500!!! Ugh....Thanks for any advice, ladies!! Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Fab4 wrote: About a year ago, I came on these boards seeking advice due to breast pain in the left breast, along with feelings of 'let-down' and some red splotches that would come and go. I went thru negative mammograms, ultrasounds that found cysts, and a breast MRI with a BIRADs 4 that had an abnormal uptake, which after the ultrasound, the radiologist said there was nothing she could find to biopsy. Here I am a year later, with the same issues still going on, only now more intense. I went for a mammogram last week, and she said it looked perfect! I explained that this has been going on for a year, her face changed and she said 'ohhh, well maybe you can ask your family doctor to prescribe an ultrasound or MRI?' So, that was Monday, today my doctor's office called to give me my mamm results---everything looks great! I told her these are still the same issues from a year ago, and asked what my breast denisty percentage was on the mammogram, and asked if I should back it up with an ultrasound?? She fidgeted for a moment, said she'd look at my report, and then said they got new computer systems, and asked if she could put me on hold for a moment. She gets back on the phone a couple minutes later and says \"Once I get to your report, I'll print you a copy a mail it to you. Ok? Bye.\" HUH?!?!  Why wouldn't she just call me back once she 'got it pulled up' and read it to me, first thing. Secondly, why couldn't she then tell me if I should back it up with an ultrasound?! This has been going on for over a year in the same breast, and they chalked it up to fibromyalgia last year. Does anyone have any experience with this type of situation? What should I do? Is it possible for one breast to continue to hurt and get worse over the course of a year and it just be nothing?? I don't have insurance, so I don't have the luxury of investigating it how I'd like to. I'm so upset and felt 'stranded' when I hung the phone up. This pain is intruding in my life, and I'm constantly aware of having a breast that hurts, while the other one could fall off and I wouldn't probably know! Any suggestions or advice from anyone is more than welcomed!! BTW, I'm 41, hysterectomy @ 4 years ago, but left with one ovary. (on the left side) Log in to post a reply",

I've looked into insurance, and in order for me to get any, because of previous medical conditions, I'd have to pay close to $700/mo for premiums. That is as impossible for me as is paying huge medical bills. I have been unemployed for several months, due to a size-down. I have to pay cash for mamms/US/MRI etc. this mamm was supposed to be a diagnostic mamm, so I was hoping that even tho she said it looked perfect, that they would go ahead and perform a US because of the on going symptoms.  I'm really worried something is lurking inside, but I can't switch Docs because no one will take me on as cash pay. Cancer runs extremely high in my family, my mom is on her 2nd bout of lung cancer, now stage IV, and my sister was diagnosed with melanoma a few months ago. We've had 15 people on my maternal side of the family die of cancer, my moms onco believes we carry a mutant p53 gene. I can't get tested, because I would then FOR SURE not be able to get ins. Not sure what to do at this point...",

      "Content": "Fab4 wrote: Left breast pain (burning/tingling), blotches, pulling sensation, areola changes, etc. So did mammo, nothing seen except cyst on other (R) breast. Week later, pain increased, and lump/thickening is now felt. Doc sends me for MRI. It shows enhancement on L breast--nothing else on L breast, and also shows the cyst that was found on mammo in R breast. So, then sent today for U/S to follow up on BIRADs 4 MRI on L breast. Found two small cysts no where near where the pain or lump/thickened area is---which was not on mammo. Radiologist says \"I can't biopsy without a target. Probably inflammation of some sort. May have something going on in the ducts and U/S wouldn't show that, anyway.\" Says I could get a MRI-guided biopsy but MRI may not even show the enhancement again, and they are very expensive. She has no idea what could be causing the pain. I was mostly relieved, but left feeling helpless and depressed. This pain is not the cyclic pain I've had off n on for years, and this has been going on for over a month now. I have no ins, so I'm at a standstill now. I am no further to a conclusion as I was a month ago. She says if I had a breast specialist down the hall, I'd walk straight into his office with you now, but I just recommend you wait 6 months and re-mammo (which showed nothing anyway because my breasts are so dense!). I cried because I fully expected to find a fibroadenoma or cyst or something benign that was the cause of my symptoms. Now I feel worse than when I went in there today.  So, should I just let it go? Have any of you ever been in this position and it turned out to be nothing? NONE of my imaging is corresponding with each other (except small cyst in R breast---that isn't hurting at all), and I'm at a loss as to whether I continue to pursue this or just let it go??? Any advice or anyone ever faced this?? Log in to post a reply",
