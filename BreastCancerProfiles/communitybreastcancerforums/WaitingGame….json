That not only need me, but that I need. However the dr just called and said as of for now they are considering each area in each breast as a cysts, but I have to follow up in 3 months with another ultrsound and possible diagnostic mammo.

On the mammo there was a lot of black, very little white towards the front. They immediately sent me for ultrasound.",
