I only started experiencing the pain in my feet and hands the last 2 treatments of Taxotere and it hasn't stopped yet. I started developing muscle and joint pain just this last 3 weeks. My Onc told me it was probably at little bit Taxotere and a lot Herceptin. I guess Herceptin can give you flu like aches and pains. I didn't experience this during chemo but they have now increased my Herceptin since it is the only thing I get now. I just finished my 2nd treatment of Herceptin alone and I think the symptoms are decreasing a bit. I do have a friend who had taxotere 4 years ago and still has the neuropathy in hands and feet. (Not the most inspiring news, I know). Unfortunately, like so much about cancer, it is too individualized to have any \"real\" idea of what to expect. I find that if I keep moving it is better than when I have been still then try to get going again. Best of luck to you!!!! Shay",

The Onc says he's comfortable with me postponing last tx but doesn't have any info on what that does for the effectiveness of the whole process. I know that people have to postpone if WBC are low but I'm wondering if anyone has any idea of how that affects the total process.My goal is to finish tx on time but I worry about these new se's and if they will go away after tx if you get too toxic.Any experiences on that?",

You just never know if you are going to be back to normal and it makes it harder when there isn't anything you can measure the success by. There is no way to know if what you are doing to your body is helping or just destroying what health you had. I am a nurse too and I think that makes it a little harder. Always want all the answers, you know? I will log into the TCH group as well. I did go ahead with my last treatment on the 28th ( my 38th birthday) and am glad to be done. Hope that i haven't pushed it oo far. Thanks for your comments.",

I am wondering if any of you have had to postpone a chemo treatment or have quit early? I have IDC stage 1 grade 3 Her2 +, Hormone -, no lymph involvement. I started TCH on Feb 13th, q 3weeks for 6 treatments. After tx #5 I had a hard time recovering. New symptoms popped up and I don't feel well yet( 2 1/2 weeks out). I am considering postponing my next treatment. Wondering if anyone knows if 5 tx's are as good as 6 or what it may do to my success if I postponeÂ my last tx.Thanks.
