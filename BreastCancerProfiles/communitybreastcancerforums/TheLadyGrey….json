I\u2019m leaning toward the flap surgery \u2014 it feels like the best way to prepare for the worst outcome, and I\u2019m getting used to that idea. I feel ashamed at my hubris 7 years ago. I was 100% confident this would not happen to me. My world class oncologist \u2014 an advisor to this site \u2014 \u201cguaranteed\u201d this would not happen. I encourage anyone who is struggling with this decision to take them both off/. They want to kill you.",

Needle biopsy diagnosis of DCIS but that\u2019s what they told me last time so I\u2019ll wait until the final pathology report before I break out the champagne. Anyone have any experience with this? I can\u2019t believe this has happened again \u2014 no family history and BRCA negative. some enterprising oncologist should study me. I\u2019m for sure having a mastectomy. I\u2019m wondering about reconstruction as I have no idea if I\u2019ll need radiation. How can you know? The flap reconstruction sounds hideously painful but I don\u2019t want to go the implant route and have a bunch of complications. I\u2019m very much a \u201cget it over with\u201d kind of chick.
