My kids' father became a meth addict which is why I had to take my kids and leave so no help on the dad front either.  I'm a teacher so we have a sick leave bank that will pay your salary up to a certain amount from which I've already withdrawn the maximum so I just have to suffer through.  I finished 19/33 last Thursday. I have a rash on my chest about 2\"X3\" that itches so badly it wakes me up at night. I've tried hydrocortisone cream, aloe vera, Aquaphor, emu oil - nothing calms the itch for more than a few minutes. I'm going crazy and only halfway through! My RO told me the radiation IS going all the way through at the top of my shoulder so the top of my lung is being radiated - that freaked me out and I started crying again - never been such a crybaby before. Anyway, then the next day I found out half my neck is being radiated and that freaked me out and I started crying again. Now my RO wants me to go somewhere else to finish treatment because I'm too emotional! I'm so tired of people expecting me to smile and be happy about all the crap I've been dealing with for almost a year now. If you can't be scared and emotional  at the doctor's office when you find out even more scary info.m then where can you be? Thanks for the support - this is about the only place I get it.  :)",

I'm frustrated because I've tried so hard throughout this nightmare to be educated about my treatments and SEs and I'm told halfway through about my back; also I asked today about staying hydrated and my techs said it wasn't necessary and wouldn't matter. I'm so confused about all the conflicting info. I've heard. I'm mostly confused about whether or not to put lotion/Aquaphor/emu oil/aloe (another question - which is really best for the skin?) on the radiated area in the morning after I shower. Everyone says don't put on anything before radiation - how many hours before? I don't go to tx until 3pm and if I don't put on anything after I shower my skin gets dry and itchy. I made sure to get a lotion without metals or fragrance and I put it on 7 hrs before tx. Is that okay? I certainly don't want to make it worse! Clothing has become a huge issue suddenly. I have burns from my collar bone to below the boob and over to my underarm. Anything touching the skin hurts and no way can I handle the pressure of a sports bra. I haven't been able to wear a bra of any kind since my first surgery 10 months ago. Lots of women say to wear soft cotton camis underneath shirts but I'm having serious hot flashes and I can't imagine wearing two layers. Anyone else experiencing hot flashes? Know of any remedies that work? Just another treat courtesy of BC! QueenKong- hope you find relief for your burns and if you do, please let me know what works as I'm just starting the really painful part and have at least 4 more weeks of burning and pain from what I hear. RMlulu - thanks for the lingo lesson - it helps! Did your RO say what to do about the rash on your incision? Mine got a little worse today. I see my RO tomorrow so I'll sk her. I've heard it's good to put A&D ointment on it but I've also heard that's not a good idea so, again, not sure what to do! My breast center offers all kinds of support groups and services but I work full-time, have two kids, and don't have any help. I also do some grocery shopping and light housework for my mom -  so, no help there either! I have a couple of friends who try to help in some way when they can but they also work & have kids so I'm pretty much on my own day to day. Life is hard. placid44 - thanks for the ideas. I eat well and rest, not sleep, quite a bit and I agree those things help. As far as focusing on radiation reducing the risk of more problems, I have a hard time with that because I'm not so sure I believe it's true. I'm trying not to think about all the other horrible things radiation might cause but I can't help it. Finding out today that it's going through my body to my back is really freaking me out. Don't know if I would have agreed to do it if I had known that.",

      "Content": "Apr 3, 2013 12:14AM - edited Apr 3, 2013 12:14AM by ChiefsFan Hey Everyone - first timer here. Just found this community today and have been reading posts for hours. I don't understand all the abbreviations but I think I'm catching on. Does tx stand for treatment?  What are SEs? Today I completed 17/33 treatments and this is the first I've heard about drinking lots of water! Seems I'm the only one who doesn't know about the importance of hydration during radiation.  I've been focusing so much on what to put on and not to put on my skin that I forgot about taking care of my skin from the inside - makes sense though. I'm a little red, a little sore and starting to get a rash on the edges of my incision. I'm terrified of what's coming.  Everyone keeps talking about wearing sports bras and loose T-shirts to work toward the last weeks of treatment but I already am in too much pain to wear any kind of bra. I wear silly shirts with ruffles in front to hide my freakish breasts and they are starting to rub against my skin.  I'm a teacher and I have to be careful what I wear to work.  I can't wear a t shirt without a bra to work and layers don't work because my hot flashes are so severe. Any ideas?  I'm a single mom and have had to work through this whole thing alone and I've about had enough. I think it's great that everyone on this thread is so positive and I'm hoping it will rub off on me because I'm just not there. It's been almost a year since my first surgery and I'm still an emotional mess. I can't find the bright side to any of this and I really hope you ladies can help me see it. Hope no one else is as miserable as I am.",

I've completed 19/33 and had to take time off because of the painful and itchy rash. I'm getting the sharp, shooting pains also (zingers, I think someone called them?) Anyway, I've always had sensitive skin and I'm terrified after reading all the posts about blisters and raw skin. I'm having a hard time already and I have a long way to go.  I start again Friday and I'm so worried - my rash isn't healing as well as I'd hoped and I'm so afraid I'm just going to blister right away. Then I think about some of you ladies who are going through so much more than I am and I feel guilty, like lemon68, for complaining.  I know I should be grateful for what I have but I can't help but envy those of you with husbands/significant others at home to help you. It's so hard being the only adult in the home with all the responsibility on my shoulders. I'm tired of working through all this crap and I'm tired of hearing myself whine!  Thanks for letting me vent! ",

My skin made it through ok with a 2 week break in the middle but my radiated breast (implant) is hard and hurts all the time. Does anyone know if that's normal? Will it soften or am I stuck with this? I know many PSs won't place implants after radiation but having implants radiated doesn't seem very smart either. You'd think with all the medical advances, there would be a less painful way for the patient. Will this nightmare ever end? I'm so tired of being in pain all the time. ",
