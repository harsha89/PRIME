I'm glad it's over - but you do get close to everyone when seeing them everyday! I am ready to get on with life and not have that daily reminder. Next week I have my appointment with the MO to get started on Tamoxifen. Lyn, I don't use Tom's deodorant. I use Schmidt's Tea Tree deodorant (all natural) for sensitive skin. I got it on Amazon. It works well for me and after the initial application or two, it goes on smoothly. What kind of coconut oil are you using? I use fractionated coconut oil. It is a liquid. Not the cooking type, but the type used with essential oils. It absorbs almost completely and comes off in the shower. Perhaps you could try that. As for the cornstarch, I apply that with a soft make-up brush. It works great, with no irritation. I actually just use 100% cornstarch that you use for cooking. And it is very soothing.",

I was surprised at how warm my breast was, and how quickly the tea helped. I didn't brew it strong enough yesterday, so I made a new batch last night. I used it right after treatment and before getting dressed to leave. It really has a comforting effect. My question is this: Do you reuse the cotton pads or do you use new ones each time. I feel like there was still a lot of tea on them and in the bag. Or, did I not use enough? I have very fair skin and I want to do everything I can not to have a terrible reaction. TIA for your help.",

I thought that I was having the 6 week treatment, but I'm actually in the accelerated program! As of today, I have done 10 treatments, and I only have 6 to go. I have been using the green tea everyday and I use coconut oil as well. My BS told me that coconut oil works best. I put a drop of lavender oil in at night. I only have some minor pinkness on my breastbone. No other symptoms. So, I am pretty happy. And so is my RO! We got an elliptical this weekend. My husband is going to put it together today - so I can start using it. I have been experiencing some minor fatigue, and I think that will help. My RO said the way to combat fatigue is to exercise!

I have to say, the anticipation of it all was so much worse than the actual treatment. I am down to 4 treatments to go! I did develop a rash on my breastbone. The RO prescribed triamcinolone acetonide cream 0.5% and it is already feeling better after one application. She also said that it was fine for me to continue using my coconut oil with lavender oil. I am a big proponent of essential oils and so far they have been fine with me using them, as long as I don't use them prior to my treatments. Since my treatments are at 7;00 am, that is not as issue. I just apply them after my treatment, many times in the dressing room, after the green tea. The tiredness (or fatigue) has really gone away too! I am grateful to be one of the lucky ones. I wish everyone had an easy time of it. I go to the MO on 8/31 to get my prescription for tamoxifen. They wanted me to wait until after radiation was over - so that they could determine the cause of any side effects (radiation or tamoxifen). I am ready to get back to a somewhat normal life.",

My RO decided to close the center on Monday for the eclipse. We live in the Nashville, TN area, and are in the path of totality. So, they are open tomorrow instead. They asked if anyone wanted to come in. I jumped at the chance. I didn't want to push my end date back. Luckily for me, I live, literally, around the corner from the center. So, I am still on schedule to be finished on Tuesday!! They did tell me today, that the side effects could continue for up to two more weeks. They said that it takes up to that long for the radiation to leave your body. I feel hopeful, that it won't worsen as long as I keep doing what I have been doing. llamalady, I will definitely post a big \"I'm finished\" for you! And I will be listening for your long-distance cheer! LOL!",

Shocked, I am so happy that you are done too - hopefully by the time you read this! I think I can speak for all of us, when I say, we can't wait for the rest of you to be finished too! It is emotional. I cried when my BS told me that she got all the cancer with superior margins and then again when I \"graduated\" from RT yesterday. I agree, Tappermom, I don't want to go back, but I will especially miss the techs. They said to come back and visit any time. I live, literally, right around the corner from the cancer center, and I get my mammograms done in the same building. So, I'll probably pop in from time to time. I hope that my skin irritation starts to go away. The RO did say it could linger (or perhaps worsen) for about a week, but then it should be fine. The rash is just so itchy, but the cream they prescribed helps tremendously. All in all, it is better than I anticipated, so I'll take it. I didn't have tattoos. I was so happy to take off all of the little stickers and be able to dry myself without having to worry about messing up the marks. (It's the little things!) My MO told me I would be taking tamoxifen. Llamalady, I will ask about the split dosage! I really don't know if I am pre- or post-menopausal. I had an ablation about 10 years ago. And I haven't had any bleeding since that day. I am 56 and I have had hot flashes (I call them my own personal summer) and night sweats, for about a year or so. But those have both subsided. I will just have to wait to see what they say at my appointment next week. ",

I have to say, that the Tamoxifen is more of a concern than anything else. Glad to hear, that so far, you are faring well. I have approached this whole treatment process with positivity and humor. Sometimes, I have been questioned for my approach, and called a hero. But, I don't fell like a hero, only a survivor. I choose to cope with my situation with positivity. I knew from the beginning that Survivor was going to be my goal. I will continue my green tea treatments. Because, like you, I believe that it has made all the difference. Not to mention that the soothing effect of the green tea soaked pads are beyond compare. And, I will continue using my coconut oil with lavender. I have actually had both my BS and my RO endorse the use of essential oils, particularly lavender oil. Anyway, to anyone reading this, please know that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. I'm sorry that any of us are on this path. I am so grateful for anyone and everyone that I have connected with on this journey! And, please know, that I pray for you all daily! Whether by name or simply by the fact that we are on the journey together.",
