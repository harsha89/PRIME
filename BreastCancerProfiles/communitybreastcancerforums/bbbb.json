I was so confused when I first went to the oncologist and he spouted of a long list of numbers and letters that described my diagnosis. I was also confused about why I actually needed chemo instead of just radiation, which is what I was first told. I have learned to write everything down, ask lots of questions, and then ask some more questions until I understand what is going on. Because of this I now know exactly what type, grade, and stage of cancer I have and what all that means, why chemo is a good treatment for me and what I can expect. Knowledge has given me peace of mind to know that I and the doctors are doing what is best for my long term prognosis. Knowing that I am doing the right thing (chemo) helps me handle it all better. Each day after diagnosis is up and down, things are constantly changing, but it does get better and these treatments will not last forever, it may just feel that way at times! We can do this and we will do this and do it well!",
