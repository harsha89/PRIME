I had a lumpectomy on 5/30 w/ sentinal node biopsy. The tumor was 2.3 cm, stage IIA cancer. They took 3 nodes, no sign of cancer there. I see my surgeon tomorrow morning for follow up and an onocologist on Tuesday morning. Any ideas on questions for them would be appreciated. I have read a lot of statistics on these boards re treatments and recurrance statistics. I would like to find some statistics on survival w/ w/out additional treatment after surgery. If anybody has any websites please send them to me. If the cancer is not in my nodes, what do you think about not doing rad and chemo and perhaps working on building up my immune system instead? Thank you for your thoughts. Peace, Dorothy Log in to post a reply",

The radiologists was generous with lidocaine and although the experience was very stressful, I can't say enough good things about the kindness of that medical community. And it looks like the cancer was contained to my breast and not lymph nodes. Thank you all for being here for me. It has meant the world. Peace, Dorothy",

Of course cancer and chemo are not death sentences, it is only our fear that tells us they are. The medication helps to keep those fears unders some control and to focus on a more positive future and outcome. I hope that you can see the dr to get meds and then after you get some meds go sooner to the dr re your lump. That will ultimately help to reduce anxiety of the unknown, doing nothing is ever so much scarier than doing something. Peace",
