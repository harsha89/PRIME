      "Content": "Starfish82 wrote: So to cut a 2 year story short... I\u2019m a 36 year old female who suffers from periductal mastitis. I have recently undergone surgery to remove a chronic subareola abcess and I have also had total duct excision, with some nipple reforming work too. Other than the slightly thick scar and odd area of skin that now sticks up(??) I\u2019m happy with the results. My problem is my other breast also suffers from the same problem (it\u2019s a smaller abcess though and i have a grade 3 inverted nipple that hurts) but my breast surgeon has now said he won\u2019t treat my left side and has discharged me, even though he originally said he would operate on both sides. So now you know my story, my question to you all is has anyone used a private hospital for anything like this? I\u2019m guessing I\u2019m kind of looking for a private hadfields operation? But I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s what I had on my right breast? Sorry for the long post, I feel like the NHS have closed the door on me and I\u2019m lost where to turn... or do I just live like this like my surgeon thinks I should? Log in to post a reply",

I have recently changed area though so I probably should see what this area say. I just fear them waiting to prod and poke me (which will make it worse) for them to say they won\u2019t help me, whereas a private surgeon won\u2019t have budgets on his mind as much.",

      "Content": "Starfish82 wrote: I'm 34, 10 months ago I gave birth to a beautiful baby girl but was unable to breastfeed due to inverted nipples. My left nipple is fully inverted and my right nipple is partially inverted. I developed mastitis in my right breast which was treated and went away. After a couple of months I developed a hard lump next to my areola which I saw a GP about, they told me to come back if it was still there after 3 months, which it was so I went back and got a referral to the breast clinic. I saw a dr and had an ultrasound and to my delight they told me it didn't look suspicious and they would see me in another 3 months for another ultrasound if it was still there. In the time between ultrasound appointments my right breast began leaking what I think is milk and blood, my nipple swelled and burst several times and now leaks fluid on a daily basis and hurts a lot. The lump is still there, you can easily feel it, its about 3cm long. I went back to the clinic last week and they did another ultrasound and took 3 core biopsies from my right breast. The dr said he suspects it's a papilloma and ultrasounded my left breast and said he thinks it's the same thing on that side too and may be what's causing the nipple retraction. He also mentioned they normally like to surgically remove papillomas. He also kept asking me if I was ok and if I understood everything, which has left me feeling like it could be more serious than originally thought. Like us all, I've done sone reading online and can see that while in the majority of cases papillomas are benign tumors it's not always the case, and if there are multiples then your chances of developing BC in the future increase. I'm now worried that even if my results come back benign (please!) I'll have to have surgery anyway. I don't have much in the way of breasts as it is (don't fill an A cup) and don't like the idea of a general anaesthesia. Should I be worried they took 3 biopsys Does anyone have any idea how much marginal tissue they take? Should I be worried about future papillomas even if they remove these ones?
