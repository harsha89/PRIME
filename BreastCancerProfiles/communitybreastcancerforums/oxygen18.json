For Taxotere, you might consider using Cold Caps as there is a possibility of some lasting hair loss, I am one of those who experienced that, and it is not always disclosed as a side effect. But I also experienced the beneficial effects of the drug, and I wish that for you. May all the prescribed drugs do a clean sweep for you. So much to process, in the beginning. We'll be here for you.

My tx was somewhat similar to yours, but they kept palpating the area to check for response during chemo. Me, at this juncture I would absolutely want a second opinion asap, even if I had to pay out of pocket. I'd want to know if two independent expert sources tell me essentially the same thing. It is essential that you receive the benefit of the best possible advice asap. Don't worry about seeming like a difficult patient, go for what you need, if I learned anything during tx it was to stay strong even when I felt like mush and to (politely) stand up for what I thought was right.

Mine too was on the dogmatic side and I had to assert myself to get answers and options I legitimately needed, and we ended up working well together. You are not weird, you are an individual. What has me puzzled is, did they really follow the proper protocol in assessing response over time. Why was my MO testing for response just a month after tx initiation, and yours just waited for pathology report. Regardless, me at this point I would gently insist on knowing what is the plan for assessing tx response, how soon will they know if they are getting it this time. And are they conducting the best available tests to try to PREDICT response. (I am just thinking aloud, just in case any of this is of use in talking with her and/or anyone else.)

At this juncture, how would one reassess her2 status and her2 susceptibility to various agents? Is there a clinical trial that would allow access to some promising anti her2 agent that you are not otherwise eligible for? Inna, I went thru 6 infusions of a similar drug, and made it, not without constantly and unabashedly asking questions about side effects. I highly recommend ksusan's Breathe page.

Reasons: I wanted to avoid more surgery and possible need for revisions and having any foreign bodies and any possibility that reconstruction might interfere with detection of recurrence or of new cancer. Also, my cancer was aggressive and I wanted to focus my strength and my attention on surviving the critical first few years. I am happy with my decision, especially since I do not perceive my femininity to be confined to specific body parts. As my fear of recurrence recedes somewhat, sometimes I consider an implant, but certainly not the more complex sorts of reconstruction. But I meditate on what things most matter to me, and on what most makes me who I am, and 12 cc of breast volume just ain't it. So the urge passes, at least for now. Nordstroms has fantastic prostheses to choose from, which I can hire and fire at will--no MRI, hospitalizations, and surgeon needed. And besides, there is some romantic cachet from being an Amazon :)",

Though the radiation does not actually stay in, the effects are cumulative over a lifetime. I have been wishing, for years, for personal medical exposure tracking devices, as in: Radiat Prot Dosimetry. 2011 Sep;147(1-2):314-6. Patient exposure tracking: the IAEA smart card project. Rehani MM1, Frush DP. Abstract .The existing approach of radiation protection is largely based on the collective dose to the population with provisions for protection at an individual level through justification and optimisation. With the individual patient dose now exceeding the life-long occupational dose to a worker in a typical radiology practice, there is a need to establish approaches based on the protection of an individual patient. Radiation exposure tracking seems a way forward in this respect. Technological advances in recent years have provided opportunities for tracking to becoming a reality. The IAEA project on Smart Card/SmartRadTrack is described in this paper. The tracking is now a reality in a few dozen centres in many countries connected by picture archiving and communication systems, and there is hope that this will extend to cover other countries and continents. ---------- To be noted, at the same time, is that the BENEFITS from a truly indicated test involving some radiation exposure, are also usually cumulative over an entire lifetime.

I love that they also explain that we should not assume all doctors know the amount of radiation exposure involved in a particular test; and that we should tell them we want to minimize exposure, because most patients are not that concerned, even though they should be. If I get your question: radiation dose to a body region, say, breast, depends on the test used, so, ultrasound involves no radiation, a mammogram involves some, a CT scan involves more radiation. If this is not what you are asking, let us know.",

So for example beans plus nuts or plus cereals, (consumed at same meal or next meal , or some say, same day), give the full complement. Often (not always), after surgery, it is also advisable to up one's iron intake. The above contain varying amounts of iron, and of course spinach is a great source. Organic spinach is best, as the regular kind is too junk-laden. Adding a spritz of lemon, or consuming other food high in vitamin C at same meal, will enhance iron absorption.
