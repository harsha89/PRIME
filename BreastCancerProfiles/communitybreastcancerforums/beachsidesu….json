Yes, I've been through the biopsy process, although not the MRI-guided, which I'm a little nervous about now. I didn't have a great biopsy so I have a little bit of apprehension but I'm just glad to have it all done. I go in on the 12th, so a week from yesterday. I have to check in at 12:45 mountain time (Denver) and we are going to drive there in the morning and they said I could have a light lunch so I'm going to enjoy myself and hopefully have a nice lunch in the mountains with my husband beforehand and just try to relax. They will hopefully have the results by the end of the week they said, I'm guessing it could even be the beginning of the following. It's around a four-hour drive there, and back, so about eight hours travel time that day, so I'm trying to decide if I'll work the next day or if I'll be too sore, etc., but I'm just overthinking everything, I can't believe I don't remember how it was last time, even though it's only been a couple of months. Have a great day, everyone, It's Wednesday, almost over the hump!",

You have so much strength, and I am sending thoughts and prayers (if you accept them!) to each and every one of you! I had a lump in June and my OB referred me for a mammogram and ultrasound which were clear, however due to density I was given an MRI, which found an area about 2.5-3 cm of non-masslike enhancement and a 6mm mass, both in the right breast. I was given a BIRADS 4 and sent to a breast center for an MRI-guided biopsy, since the ultrasound didn't pick it up. In August, I was supposed to have the biopsy, but when I got there the Rad decided against the MRI, and tried to do an ultrasound-guided instead, for some strange reason. She said several times that she couldn't find the area, but still took 12 cores from an area in my breast, which then came back as normal breast tissue/fibroadenomatous changes. I saw the breast surgeon for my follow up where I was told that they didn't even look at the 6mm mass with irregular margins, because I was under forty and I couldn't have cancer. (I'm almost 38) He said that he, \"Wouldn't worry about it because even if it was cancer it would take several years before it would be the size of my pinkie nail.\" I came home from that doctor crying and in disbelief, it was a four hour trip (they didn't even bind me, I got a huge hematoma and lymph issues as a result) and my primary was furious. She said that it wasn't supposed to be ultrasound, and that they had done half the job. Anyway, we decided to go to a different breast center, in a different state.. They had me do another MRI eight weeks after the first one to ensure that the lesions/ROIs were still there, before taking the time to travel there, etc, when we saw the MRI we were shocked to see that the nonmass like enhancement has not been changed at all, it doesn't look like any of the tissue has been removed, especially 12 cores worth of it. It is the same shape, same size, the report says that it is unchanged from the previous report. The biopsy clip is nowhere close to the region, although those can shift, taken with the fact that the area still is the exact same as it was before the biopsy, it looks like it still hasn't been biopsied. And they didn't even attempt the mass. So now, I am scheduled a week from today and I am full of anxiety. It's like this process is just never ending. I have just had to deal with one thing after another, I thought for a while it was over but then finding out that it wasn't even close it was like making it even worse. To add to it, come to find out, in the second MRI, they said that the left breast has an area of \"unchanged\" multifocal nodules and there are other nodules around the 6mm mass in the right, so it looks like the other ones are kind of in a grouping around that one main focus. Those are also unchanged, so they were there in the MRI eight weeks earlier, they just didn't note them in the report. So, in less than a week, I'll be having 2-3 biopsies, depending on if they decide to biopsy the left as well as the two areas in the right. And it's just really getting to me. Even though I've already \"been there done that.\" Sorry this was so long, I just needed to vent I guess. I really have enjoyed reading your stories, I've cried for you guys, and been so hopeful and crushed, alternately depending on what has been going on with your diagnoses. Now that I'm facing another round of biopsies, around another holiday, I thought i'd join your club for a little companionship. Much love to all of you.",

Sorry I was away for the week, it's been crazy with the biopsies on Tuesday, and then it didn't go as smoothly as I'd hoped so today is the first day I've really felt like typing much! DagnyT, thanks for checking in, it means a lot! So when I checked in for the biopsy they sure did treat me like a VIP, they had a card waiting with a Starbucks gift card! It made me feel great. They had a slight paperwork mix up and only had one biopsy down for the procedure but I quickly made sure that was supposed to be two. They fixed it right away and I got back fairly quickly. The MRI-guided biopsy.. Not fun. I underestimated how much not fun it would be. They put the guide in the wrong place and had to start over in one spot, and then with going in and out of the machine nine thousand times I was on my face and sternum for almost three hours. One of the numbing shots went right through the other side of my breast. :( So I have four holes. I wouldn't stop bleeding, so from the time I got there to the time I got to leave was almost five hours. But through it all the people were PHENOMENAL. I can't complain. And they called me the next day with my results, I think it was close to noon... Benign. BENIGN!! One area is duct ectasia and fibrocystic changes, the other area, the 2:00 area is duct hyperplasia, adenosis, and proliferative fibrocystic changes. They put me on a six month MRI schedule due to the fact that the hyperplasia was borderline ADH and I also have an area on the left side that wasn't biopsied that looks on MRI very similar to the area on the right, so there's a possibility that it is the same thing. But I couldn't be more relieved. Cancer free and on a strict imaging and biopsy plan, I don't think anything is going to slip by. Had it just been normal tissue, they would have just sent me home, with no plans to come back for follow up, so this is really the best thing that could have happened to me. I am ready to just move forward now, and get on with my life. I know that it may be a long road, with biopsies, and many, many times of waiting and fear, but right now, I'm going to enjoy this day. I hope that everyone else is doing ok. I have been thinking about every one of you, and hoping that every day brings some joy! Lots of love and wishes for healing and peace! Crystal.",

I'm getting a little more nervous for Tuesday but my nurse navigator says that I can pop that Xanax as soon as my paperwork is signed. They said that since it has been since a \"rocky road,\" I will be treated like a VIP patient, so that made me smile a little, I hope that it will be a little easier when I get there. I am ready to have this done and over with and get the results, hopefully they're back before Christmas!!! I hope everyone is doing as well as possible, getting through these days as well as possible, it seems like we're all waiting for something, whether it's like a couple of us that have biopsies coming up or waiting on results, or on surgeries, or even on starting treatments, we're all kind of waiting, I hope in the process we can find some peace, even for a few minutes. Much love to you all, hope you are having a great weekend!",

I think that the ductolobular tissue is indicative of where it came from in the breast, not necessarily of any condition, it came from the lobular regions of the breast.. However I could be wrong. I think it sounds completely normal. I would speak to your ob/gyn or see if a surgeon could advise to ask if that is correct information! Otherwise, I think you need a plan to keep you from worrying anymore about these results! Great news though!",

My primary says it is healing as well as possible but it could take a very long time to return to \"normal,\" and even then it will have some scar tissue, they took between ten and twelve cores from the area. The doctor says that as long as they are where the clips are they should be fine as far as imaging is concerned, an experienced radiologist will know what they are looking at!! Don't worry :D",
