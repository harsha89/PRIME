I also had to lymph nodes removed that were cancer free. I had stage 1 cancer.  The pain started about the time I had an esophageal problem that caused bloat and pain.  It has since been resolved but the pain is still there. I feel it mostly when I where a bra or lay down.  When I lay down it is like the area is stretched and gets painful.  I am not sure it is the bone because I have what seems like a swollen ridge of fat or muscle.  I have asked my docs and they do not seem concerned. Has anyone had this? Is it a result of the radiation which was on my left breast? Thanks for any perspective.    ",
