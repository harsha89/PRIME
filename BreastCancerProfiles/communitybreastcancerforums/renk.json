To answer the above question my mother is 50 years old, very active and we thought, extremely healthy, woman.  She jogs, rows on a team in the summer months, excercises daily and all in all is a very active woman.  She has no other health concerns, and for the most part enjoys a healthy life style.  Which is why it seems crazy to me that she could have had this growing there but feel so healthy.  I guess that's the problem with cancer though, it just sneeks up on you sometimes. She has chosen the lumpectomy with radiation.  For her this was the best option that fit her lifestyle and was a decision she could live with.  The thought of having her breast removed was almost unbearable for her, she thinks that sounds vain but she says she feels like that's part of her \"womanhood\" would be gone.  For me, however I know I would be the same as you Parentof1 and I would always be wondering if it would go to the other breast or somewhere else(although I know this doesn't always happen) and I would not be able to handle the stress of wondering.  She did tell her surgeon today however that, if the day of the lumpectomy the lymph nodes come back positive she wants the breast removed instead.  Her surgeon gave us the impression that they will harvest a few lymph nodes that day and do an instant test (he said frozen plate?) that will determine if the nodes are positive. Is this right? I always thought we would have to wait a week or two for those results? Anyway, right now were all just trying  to adjust I guess.  Surgery should take place next week, I guess we just have to wait again.  Praying now that she won't need chemo and that after the lumpectomy and radiation that will be it.  Parent of 1, thank you for all the info in your post.  I will definately check into the BC Navigator, seems like a very valuable resource. Thank you for that suggestion.  I'll keep you all posted.",

However, now that she is, we'll beat it together.  Send prayers our way for good news on Friday.",

Can you sense my excitement!!!lol Doc says that it's not 100% as we still have to wait for the final patho report, however he tells us that the test is a very reliable tool.  So, were celebrating. Yippee Yesterday was a very hard day, and very emotional.  My mom was so nervous, as were we and the waiting was just unbearable.  There were alot of tears shed yesterday and alot of I love yous said.  In one way, you know, cancer did give us something: It made us even stronger as a family.  Ready to stand together, and fight.  Love conquers all right?  Now to gear up for the patho report and start of radiation.  But for tonight, we're celebrating. Thanks everyone for the posts, I can't tell you how much I appreciate them.",

And this not knowing and second guessing is so stressful.  I think it's worse when you do have some medical background, because I have so many horror stories and have seen so many horrible things happen to wonderful people that I can't help but wonder if this will be our family.  I remind myself that I've also seen miracles and have had many positive experiences as a nurse but again, that fear of the unknown is there.  Sometimes I do find it hard because my mom looks to me for answers and insight into all of this and honestly I find myself at a complete loss of words.  I do not know what advice to give.  I know what I would say if she was my patient but she is my mom, all I want to do is kiss her, tell her that I love her and that I wish this were a horrible bad dream.  How can I advise her medically when I don't even want to face that she could be sick?  Parentof1, thank you so much for your heartfelt response, it helped me tremendously.  I am so happy to hear that you had a negitive CT Scan, you must feel like a huge weight has been lifted at this moment.  I hope I can feel like that someday soon too.  Right now, everything seems like it's going in slow motion.  My mom spoke with the surgeon today and he said he would call her as soon as the results are in, possibly Thursday.  She wants me to go with her.  I hope I can handle the wait and be her rock as she has been for me over the years.  I'll keep you posted.",

      "Content": "renk wrote: It seems like 2011 has started out in the worst way possible.  On Jan 5th, my mom had an ultrasound of the breast after being recalled on her mamo.  During the ultrasound, the radiologist was called in and stated that she\"was very concerned\" and in her opinion the 2 cm mass she found was \"consistent with malignacy\".  She told her to be prepared for a breast cancer diagnosis and a biopsy was scheduled for 2 days later.  Since this time she has had her biopsy and our family, which is extremely close is in complete turmoil.  My mother is my rock, she means everything to myself and my family and the thought of her being sick or losing her is almost unbearable.  I am going completely out of my mind waiting for the pathology reports to see the extent to this.  I am wondering if there is any chance that the radiologist may have been wrong? I know intellectually(I'm a nurse) that most likely she is right but emotionally I can't bring myself to believe it.  The radiologist did say that her lymph nodes& lymph collection channels all appeared normal.  But can they really be so sure?  Sorry about the rant, just can't believe this is happening and wish I could take all of this away from her.
