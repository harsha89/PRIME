As far as I go, I would rather just know the bad news than wait a week. I haven't been able to focus at work or to eat. It is just so stressful. They called me back Monday without much information. So, I emailed my PCP today. She called me and also send the radiology report to me. \"Mammogram Findings: There are scattered fibroglandular densities There is a focal asymmetry measuring 7 millimeters seen in the inferior region of the left breast. In the right breast there are no suspicious findings. Conclusion: Focal asymmetry in the left breast requires additional evaluation. We will recall the patient for additional imaging.\"",

Right breast no suspicious findings.\" I am also a nurse. Hard to focus at work right now. They didn't have any call back appointments available until April 10th. I hope everyone here is getting relieving news!! I am 54 fyi.. first time ever having a call back. But, my last mammogram was 9/2014... so I missed 3. :(",
