Had no real negative side effects from Avastin (bloody nose while on it).  Have more long term side effects from chemo, neuropathy in feet, very poor memory, etc....Just wondering if women are still being enrolled in this clinical trial and wondering how those of you that may have been in it are doing....God bless all of you!!!

It's so much more than being \"tired\" and only those who have been there really get what it's like. Tough situation though.....if she does end up coming to visit, just do what you would be doing if you had no visitors. Sleep & do nothing but be horizontal whenever you feel the need. You are not entertaining in any way, shape or form. Do whatever you feel like doing when you want to do it. Hang in there, I started my very aggressive chemo/radiation regime 3 years ago next week. Can not believe it's that far behind me now. You will be done soon! Be well.....",

Each year is a big milestone and waiting in the waitingroom of the breast center at NY Columnbia Presbyterian Hospital always causes much stress & worry until the radiologist comes out with the \"your all clear\"!!!  Then it's into my surgeon's office for a clinical exam, where he also proclaimed the same.  My husband & I celebrated with a lovely dinner & much needed cocktail on the way home!! As you can see from my profile, many lymph nodes involved so each \"all clear\" I get is huge!! Onc visit next week where she screens blood for tumor markers, but Im sure that will be all clear as well.  Thanks for your stories here on the stage 3 forum.  You all inspire me every day!! God bless! To those of you new to this bc \"club\", there is much hope and I'm living proof!! You will come out the other side & recapture your life!!
