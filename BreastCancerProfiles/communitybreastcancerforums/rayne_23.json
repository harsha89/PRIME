Does this sound like a Dx that you would subject your body to the poison of Chemo?? our medical docs say do chemo, rads and tamoxifen. our naturopath says, do the tamoxifen, but anymore is really overkill. We're torn. i know there are people out there with the same Dx that have done Chemo and others with the same Dx that have not. if it were Grade 1 as well as simply stage one i can see Chemo being moreso of overkill. i worry about mets popping up later being that it's Grade 2. i'm not asking for answers of course, just plenty of honest opinions. Thanks ladies! :) -Rayne. Log in to post a reply",

So that's 97%...or 3% of reoccurance of breast cancer in the breast. now...theres a 25% reoccurence of cancer elseware.  minus 14% if we do rads. minus another 9% if we do chemo.   which makes 2% chance of Cancer popping up elseware in the body. That's including Chemo, which is what's in question. so we're still not sure, but opinions...and educating ourselves is helping more and more with the decision. -Rayne",

She's on day 9 of her 21 day rad treatment, and after the 8th treatment (yesterday) she's been hurting, and getting 'shooting pains'. Enough to stop her mid-sentence. Today, tuesday, the pains still persist and she got to talk to her doctor about it. he said, that it's simply from the swelling and will go away. It just doesn't seem like a pain that severe, originating from the scar of her surgery shooting down to under her arm is only from swelling, she's not overly swollen anyway. Forgive my raised eyebrow at his words, but that just seemed like a passive answer. In truth, i doubt there is much we can do about the pain (sweetheart is curled up with a warm compress...like a hot water bottle) and she says it's much better. My question is that has this happend to anyone else, and although I only imagine it gets worse before it gets better, how long did it last for you?? Any experience, thoughts, advice or comments are welcome. Thanks,  -Rayne. Log in to post a reply",
