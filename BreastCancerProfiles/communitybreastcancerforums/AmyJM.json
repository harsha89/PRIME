After looking it up some, I think it's probably due to a slight rash in the area - I guess an infection can cause an enlarged lymph node in that area, but any kind of mass makes me nervous these days. I called my onc's office and they said to go through my primary care dr first - so I called there and got an appt with a nurse/practitioner tomorrow. I know it's probably not connected to the cancer, but I'm still anxious about it - I'm just hoping it's something simple that has a simple remedy too!

She didn't seem to think it was cancer-related (other than possibly in part due to an already over-taxed system), but wasn't dismissive of it either. She said something about it maybe being a gland, and that it may clear up on it's own. She suggested trying a warm compress on what looked like a blocked follicle and said that might help with the main lump too, even though it's deeper. She said it was moveable and no sign of infection (no fever or redness), so to keep an eye on it for now and come back in a week to have it rechecked. She also said, if there was any change, to feel free to just stop in before that and she'd see me. I'm feeling a little better now since she seemed to think it wasn't cancer-related but is still taking it seriously and monitoring it. It especially helped to know that I could stop in at any time if things got worse. Thanks all for all your support and good wishes - it means a lot! Amy",

My dr wants to get an x-ray of it, which they're going to schedule sometime before my next doctor's visit on 11/14. It sounds like there's a good chance that it's nothing - they just want to check it out to be sure.

Amy Jean - that whole scenario you posted about does sound a bit fishy and the comment about \"the more popular\" cancer is just offensive, especially to those of us struggling with costs too.",

It is more than warranted for any of us and we all get it - this is the place to rant when you need to! I know what you mean about the hard part being worrying about the ones we will leave behind.  It breaks my heart every time I think about it - especially my husband and my sons.  I think Ebru is right too though, that they will be okay - it'll be so hard for them, but they will get through it.

I'm game for however folks want to do it, but I thought the idea of alternating months was a good idea too. Maybe every other month, a non-fiction, such as \"Being Mortal\" or \"When Breath Becomes Air\" and the other months, a fiction novel, just for fun. Then, folks could decide to opt out some months, if it was a book they didn't want to do. I'm in another book group and could throw novel suggestions into the hat, but I'm interested in the other books too.",

      "Content": "AmyJM wrote: We've had so much joy lately - a new grandson and good scan results, but life really got thrown off-track this week.  My husband lost his job yesterday.   I'm a preschool teacher (who makes very little money to begin with) and the school year ends in a couple weeks.  That means after this month there will be no paychecks for awhile (other than unemployment benefits).  I might be teaching a couple of summer camps at the preschool (thank goodness) if we get enough kids signed up.  That will only be 4 out of 12 weeks though (and, as I said, it doesn't pay much). Also, I need to figure out the insurance piece of it - a long time ago, when he was unemployed for a few months, we did COBRA (which was very expensive), but a friend of mine who knows a lot about navigating the system said that we should look into health insurance from the affordable care act - apparently, even after the enrollment is closed, you can apply for it if you have a change in your financial situation.    We're one of those families that just gets by, paycheck to paycheck (we haven't been able to save up due to a pretty modest income and a fair amt of debt from other times when times were hard).  My mom can help us some, but I'm still worried about the future.  Hopefully, he'll find something soon (and may be able to do some temp work or a part-time job in the meantime), but there is no guarantee, and I worry about the whole insurance thing - I'm sure there will be some complications and I've no idea what kind of coverage we'll have.  It's hard enough dealing with the financial demands of Stage IV, without complications with the insurance!  This is so hard on my DH too - I feel so badly for him!  I know he'll hit the ground running, looking for a new job, like he did last time, but he's pretty devastated right now.  I know we'll get through this, but right now I could use some good thoughts, prayers and support.  If you have any words of wisdom you want to send my way too, feel free. Thank you all for being there, Amy A footnote - he hated his job, so this may be a blessing in disguise IF he finds something else soon.  That's a pretty big if though, and right now it's pretty scary.

It's not that I'd want it to be all doom and gloom, just a little more well balanced as to the realities of living with mbc.

I'm an optimistic person by nature, and am happy for all that we can do in the midst of this, but I worry that others looking in from the outside, would see this and think mbc must not be so bad - look at all they can do still. It isn't realistic and still is kind of sweeping under the rug the struggles and pain so many go through. I would have liked to have seen profiles where they share their fears, struggles AND ways they are still living in positive ways with mbc.",

Anyway, my son and his girlfriend were in town from Virginia, and I had to choose between spending their last day here at the cancer center (appt was at 1, including a zometa treatment, so that would have meant most of the afternoon), or postponing the appt a week and spending the whole day with my kids. I decided I'd rather have the day with them - we only see them twice a year. I've been feeling fine and it's been stable up until now, and even if there is anything new, I figured a week wasn't going to make much difference. It's funny, having made the choice, I'm actually less anxious about getting the results back right away - I might still call early in the week to check, but I think I'd be alright waiting until Friday too. It's going to be another busy week to keep me distracted!",

Last April, they were up to 56, so had a CT/PET scan which showed no progression. At the end of July, my TM numbers were up to 84, so another scan this coming Tuesday. Depending on what it shows, I may stay on Arimedex or may switch to Faslodex/Ibrance. I'd been holding steady for three years (not NED, but no progression either), but I'm really worried about it this time. There 's something about the first progression - really takes you out of denial-land and drives home the point that I can't just stay in a holding pattern forever.",

It basically said that the lesions had not increased in size or number, but they have become more active since the last scan. I got a call from my onc's NP today and she said it wasn't a big concern (the way she put it was that it \"wasn't anything to write home about\") but said that my onc decided it was time to switch treatments, to stay on top of things. So, no more Arimidex and starting this Friday, it's on to Faslodex/Ibrance. I have very mixed emotions - I'm glad it didn't spread, but there's still the whole psychological/emotional thing about changing treatments for the first time. And, even though she said most folks tolerate the Faslodex/Ibrance fairly well, I'm pretty sure it won't be as easy as the Arimidex was. The only side effect I really had from that was occasional hot flashes, and possibly making my arthritis a little worse. ",

My understanding of it was that the CT and Bone scans showed what was there, and the PET scan showed where any active cancer was. I think the CT scans will show if there is anything new, but might not show what is active or not in what was already there. For instance, when I finally had a PET scan, it showed that some of the mets in my spine that still showed up were inactive. IMO, the PET is more thorough of a representation of what is going on, but the CT scan (in my case, I had a bone scan too - not sure if you are) is the next best thing and probably sufficient to see whether or not there is progression.

I just wanted to add that I so agree with what Penny, you and others have said about good coming from the bad. One of my favorite verses in the Bible is Romans 8:28 \"We know that in everything, God works for good with those who love him, who are called according to his purpose.\" In no way do I consider having cancer a blessing or anything I would ever have wanted to happen (and I don't believe that God wanted it to happen or caused it either), but there have been blessings that have come from it, including a deeper faith and being able to be there in a much more meaningful way for other women I knew or met who were diagnosed with bc after I was. To me, the verse means that God is always working for the good, and can take anything, no matter how bad it is, and bring good from it. As far as God watching over you, I've always felt that God's love is like that of a parent - not stepping in to always make everything go right, but rejoicing with us when they do and there to hold us up and give love and support when they don't. In my opinion, God is still right there with you. Fitzwins - thanks for recommending the book, A Grace Disguised. It looks like a good one. I've read When Bad things Happen to Good People, but not this other - I think I may look into it. Sending love and prayers and hugs to you, Allyme, and to all my bco sisters, Amy",

In fact, my book group is meeting for dinner, later this month, to choose books for next year, and I'm going to recommend this one. I agree with a lot of what others said about it. I agree with how important a \"community\" is in one's life. It \"saved\" him more than once and he, in turn, made such a difference in the lives of others. I thought he was endearing, even though he didn't come across that way to most - I'd never thought about the possibility of Aspergers (and the author probably didn't either is my guess), but I can see that. I also thought he was a lot older - maybe because he was portrayed as an old man - and being in my 50's, I don't feel old! One thing that wasn't addressed in the questions, that I thought this book also portrayed, was the influence others have on us and how they shape who we are. Whenever he felt disinclined to help others, he usually came around when he thought about what his father would have done or how it would have made his wife feel. I'm sure he made a big impact on the lives of those he helped too.",

So, I would think that no matter how early the tumor is caught or what the treatment is, no one is immune from a recurrence.  Most folks that think they are \"cured\" can't handle that idea though. Noquitter - your situation is so similar to mine - I was also 43 the first time around (2003 - stage llla, mastectomy on the right side, 6 mos. of chemo but no radiation) - thought I was free and clear after 5 years - only to have the stage IV diagnosis this past May, almost 10 years later.  I can so relate to everything you've said!  I'm sorry you had to deal with the self-righteous \"cured\" co-worker.  I really do think she's just scared to death to entertain the thought that it could ever come back for her. I want the whole Elephant line too - the elephant slapper, the mug - and the t-shirt sounds great!  I think the elephant slapper should be stuffed or like a rubber chicken or a dog toy or something. : ) Amy",
