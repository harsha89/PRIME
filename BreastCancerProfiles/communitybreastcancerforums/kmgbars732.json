I was diagnosed in March 2016 at age 36. I did the genetic testing and tested negative for every single thing they could possibly test me for. However, I am still having a bilateral mastectomy (with reconstruction, since I am so young). Here's why: my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer at the same age, same type (triple positive). She opted (in 1991) for just mastectomy on the one side, chemo, radiation. Nine years later, she was diagnosed with a second primary breast cancer in the other breast. Mastectomy, chemo, radiation again. Different type of cancer (though I don't seem to recall the type on this one). She tested postive for a BRCA 1 mutation with VUS. I do not have the same BRCA 1 mutation. I do not have any mutation (which I find a little hard to believe). Regardless, I opted for the bilat because I just don't want to go through this again. EVER. I would have my ovaries out too, if they would allow it. I joke that they can take anything I don't absolutely \"need\" - spleen, appendix, whatever! Please let us know what you decide to do and if you have any questions. The folks on here are extremely knowledgeable and helpful as we go through these difficult situations and make the hardest decisions of our lives. Be well, Kelley",
