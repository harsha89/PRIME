Yes lymphedema is not reversible  only in stage 1, and it is never cured. Once it progresses to stage 2 then can only be managed.    The other day I noticed slight swelling in my right hand (cancerous side); after aggressive elevation the swelling did go down, but now I have a call out to my LE specialist, to see what my next step is. My left breast was a simple mastectomy (non cancerous side), my choice to remove so kept lymph nodes in, so far no problems in my left breast so far.   Thanks so much for the informative article, which will be helpful for now and the future.",

      "Content": "Apr 29, 2017 08:55PM - edited May 1, 2017 09:17AM by Bravenurse13 I am getting radiation at this time.  My  oncology radiologist will not radiate my underarm where all my nodes were taken  ( cancer free per pathology report), is a protocol for IBC. radiology feels that radiation under the arm after mastectomy may increase risk to develop LE.  Anyhow, my lymphedema specialist wants me to purchase a compression devise for bedtime to prevent LE.  She stated that radiation may cause some swelling so no need to spend 800.00 then my swelling goes down and I cannot fit properly into the brace.  I was told as soon as my arm feels heavy or I have a change in range of motion to see her to get fit for a sleeve immediately.  She warned me that I should not measure and order one on my own, because if it is ill fitting it may make the condition worse. Today I was working outside, and doing heavy work, but trying to use the left much more than the right.  I am also lifting back to as much as I did before my BMX, and am back to work full time.  It is now 8 weeks post-op so things are doing very well. I try not to limit myself too much, just be aware of what I do.  If I get bug bites, I don't scratch.  If I get a small scratch I put antiseptic on it and keep monitoring.  One must live their life to the fullest, with careful monitoring and common sense by not overuse of LE arm. Lymphedema can be reversed  at stage 1; once it progresses to stage 2 then it is managed. LIVE   LAUGH  and  LOVE",

I can get both arms way above my head, my right side I had lymph node removal, much more sore than the left, which was just a simple mastectomy. I am now 6 weeks post-op feel fantastic!!! I hope you will feel the same soon.  Chemo was not too bad, only had a few real bad weeks, but the rest I kept busy with work. Now I think back on it and I wonder how I did it? Lucky many of us are, and thank goodness...    Feel better.",

PS filled bilateral expanders now I am at 550 cc one more fill, and scheduled for radiation on right breast only. Plan is to (if all goes well), to do exchange surgery 6 weeks after radiation.  If there are complications with skin, I will have to wait 6 months out. PS states that waiting after 6 months the skin goes through changes, where doing sooner, skin is easier to deal with and better results.",

      "Content": "Mar 25, 2017 10:24PM - edited Mar 25, 2017 10:33PM by Bravenurse13  I recently had a modified radical mastectomy on the right, and simple mastectomy on the left (my choice), 4 weeks ago. I worried about the same thing, and I came from the front, cleaning front to back to prevent e-coli contamination.  I also bought a hand held shower and kept drains out of the way to shower, no problems! I will tell you I was really sore and my range of motion was limited on the right side, due to lymph nodes were taken so more work on that side as well as trauma. I started exercise with pulleys and I must say it has been such an improvement for my range of motion so far. I will need to be able to raise my hands over my head for radiation treatments which will be possibly be in the next couple weeks.  All is well. You may be surprised how well you will do.  I was apprehensive as you were, and I have been surprised how well I have done.  Be positive, be brave, and know that you have others here that will support you, and never feel embarrassed. As far as being alone, that is going to be a challenge.  Especially getting out of bed for the first week.  Hopefully you can arrange to have a recliner, if you don't have one already.  Hopefully you can have people check on you periodically, if you have home health, a nurse can assist you to get assistance for you if you are alone.  Start Freezing meals so they can be warmed up with no meal prep.  Get protein shakes ready to go, just take out of fridge with no prep.  Make it as easy on yourself as possible. Most likely you are having a modified radical (one step up from simple mastectomy). I know I kept calling it a radical mastectomy, and I am a nurse. Good luck and keep us posted.",

I had my surgery Febuary 24th, my birthday was 3 days later; was not feeling festive, but glad my BMX went well.  I am going on my 4th week now drains out so far no complications.  My right breast was the one with the cancer, and my BS decided I did not need to remove the left breast, but my mindset was to never have to worry of mammograms again, d/t the inconclusive results each time. I had reconstruction with TE, and yesterday was the 1st day my PS inflated by 125 ml each.  It was uncomfortable last night; however, after doing exercises with PT the gentle stretching really assisted me, and I am not doing too bad for going on 4 weeks after surgery.  I do have muscle relaxers, but find that if I break a 5 mg Flexeril pill in half, it is enough to assist me to stretch without too much discomfort. I have been lucky so far.  A week after my surgery, my path report was clean, with no residual cancer to be found!  It is almost hard to believe.  I was diagnosed with IBC at the end of September, within a week a port, chemo was started, within that time I received a gift of a pneumothorax by inserting the port so had to spend one night in hospital with chest tube under observation.  My oncologist hit me hard with Adriamycin and Cytotoxin every three weeks x4 ( I worked during that time). Taxol and Herceptin was then started afterward every three weeks x4.  Now it is only Herceptin every 3 weeks x 1 year with Arimedix x 10 years. I am getting some energy and have to start thinking of going back to work soon!  I can't imagine, but I know I can do it. Radiation will also start soon.  My PS wants to inflate me before my 1st radiation treatment, that will be 33-35 treatments 5 days a week. I will not look forward to the exchange surgery for the implants, and PS wants to fix the extra skin that was resulted from BS taking out all the lymph nodes under my arm.  This is such a long journey I tell ya, and is not for the faint of heart. When it comes to a cancer diagnosis, one does not have real control anymore, one just gets scooped up and hopes for the best, with a \"can do\" attitude.  I still can't believe it's happening, but it is! I only wish the best for everyone else.      Best of luck to those that had surgery in Febuary.",
