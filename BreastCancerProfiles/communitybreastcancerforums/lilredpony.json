Pray that they do find a cure for us all. ",

Praise God, I am so amazed that there is someone like you.  I'm sorry, I'm bawling my eyes out as I type right now because I am so scared right now and in pain because I took the Nulasta shot yesterday and feel pretty yucky.  I have a bone met on my rib and lower back.  Im completely taken aback on how many of you have similar to me.  It does give me hope.  I will pray for you all  - THANK YOU for your stories, it means so much right now and I hope to be a survivor someday for my kids and grandkids and husband",
