I had more painful experiences at the effin dentist..  It was so tolerable!  What was weird was (and I dont remember anyone else posting this) is that before they got started, they handed me a Sharpie marker and told ME to write the word \" yes \" on the breast I was to get biopsy done on..  Ummmm okay ... .  The nurses/techs were super nice, but I was suprised as at the last minute, only one mass was biopsied, thought it was gonna be all, but , it is what it is.  The shot I got to numb wasnt that bad and didn't feel when they did the actually taking of sample, sounded like a stapler when you slam it ... Dr mentioned I may be sore due to the fact the mass was so close to the chest wall & muscle , have Tylenol on hand. I must say the sports bra was helpful for the ice pack but found my reg bra w a small towel to make comfy seemed to be best ( site was at 6 o'clock) Got my aftercare instructions, an icepack ,a pat on the back and was told you will be hearing fm your Dr when the results are ready. so insert Jeopardy theme song here and let the waiting commence! Thank you all so much for your thoughts and prayers!    Stacey",

Thank you all so much : ) I am ready to get this show on the road , have all the appropriate underthings and ice packs.  And what helps me get thru Things That Suck is I have little treats for myself spread out tomorrow, some new tea for the AM, (appointment is at 10 AM)  brownies for lunch ( yum ) and my hubby will make some jambalaya for dinner.  And then the wait for the results..... *sigh*     Deep heart felt thanks to all  : ) Stacey  ",

Surprise surpise. To make matters more interesting, I have no insurance, so add to the madness of the games your mind plays with you, the seemlessly unending paper pushing that goes with qualifying for financial aid, getting the run around trying to figure out how to go about schedual appointments, waiting to get approval, feeling like your whole financial life has to be picked through ,, oh gee I am venting now lol  sorry back on topic : ) Monday is the biopsy, U/S guided of all 4 masses, bless the docs heart for saying \"we'll do all, not just the biggest as originally planned\"  I am feeling ok about it I guess, I have done the internet searches til I over dosed on info, I went through all the worst case senarios in my brain, along w the fairy tale ending ones which ends w me getting some magical cream to apply for 2 days and all is well, happy ever after. The only people who know are my husband and my brother, as I feel like I don't want to worry my family/friends until there is something to worry about, so I am glad I can come here to vent or get opinions and not feel so alone : )  Also my mom is a bc survivor , 5 years now, so I would love to pick her brain but feel like I dont want her to needlessly worry if its nothing. Plus they all live out of state. What has worked for ya'll as far as keeping positive and or busy til the wait game is over? And I am a bit nervous about how sore I will be the days after , I'm a hairdresser so always have my arms up, and any insight will be greatly appeciated.  Thanks in advance  Stacey Log in to post a reply",
