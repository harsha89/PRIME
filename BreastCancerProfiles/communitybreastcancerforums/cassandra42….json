Maybe what scares me most is that they will find more cancer and I'll have to go back for a mastectomy. My teaching semester starts this week and runs into December and I'm afraid of the time involved for surgery. Having been through one mastectomy, I dread the aftermath. Finally, I really want to keep this breast--after losing the other one, it's sort of become my \"pal.\" Well, I made it through this message so I guess that's something accomplished.

      "Content": "cassandra42 wrote: Greetings, I have been through chemo and have a lumpectomy scheduled later in August. I had a very uncomfortable MRI done a couple of weeks ago; this is where things get dicey. I scheduled an appointment yesterday with my surgeon specifically to go over my visuals: original mammogram, ultrasound and MRI. I thought that by comparing them I might get a better picture of what had transpired through chemo. Since they were all targeting different areas, were of different sizes and I had trouble pinning my surgeon down, I was left with the MRI to use in my decision. The MRI shows a 2.4 cm mass which the surgeon feels would work for a lumpectomy. However, the image also shows a �tail� going towards my nipple, which may be cancerous. If it turns out to be positive, I would have to have a mastectomy later. I should mention that the oncology staff felt the tumor had practically disappeared and the surgeon couldn't feel it at all. I would like to hear your opinions on MRI results. My doctor told me a couple of stories. One was that the MRI had shown the tumor at 4.0, they went in and it turned out to be 1.0! As I understand it, MRI for the breast is not as reliable as for joints, which I have had many images done for. Bear in mind that I'm not asking for any surgery advice; I wouldn't lay that trip on you, and the decision has to be mine. Just wondering what other people's MRI experiences have been.

      "Content": "cassandra42 wrote: Greetings, I'm in the final stages of treatment for a left side lumpectomy, radiation. I have never gotten the kind of advice I've been reading about, although I've had -20 lymph nodes removed from both sides (right mastectomy, different BC about 20 yrs. ago). I have been told not to have a blood pressure cuff applied, or to have blood drawn or shots given in those arms. That's a chore in itself, because medical personnel seem to be woefully ignorant about possible lymphedema. Nobody has told me about using cuffs or whatever on airplane flights. Not to mention a ton of other stuff I apparently should know. All they've done is push me into rads, which itself can apparently cause problems. I'm just glad I insisted on waiting until my surgery wounds have mostly healed. After having my port removed, I find out that I have to have blood tests during rads, and they use ports for that! I had all I could do to talk them into a finger poke, which was unnecessarily painful. Clearly I'm steamed. I've recently learned of one lady, possibly an older mastectomy recipient, but whose arm is so swollen that her arm has been pulled out of its socket! And there seems to be nothing that can be done for her. OK, on to second matter. Why don't we have medical ID cards, bracelets, etc. for potential lymphedema? This condition certainly seems serious enough to warrant it. I have fears of needing an ambulance and not being able to communicate this issue. Ugh! Comments, please.
