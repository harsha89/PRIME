I am a plus size, and they weren't easy to find - try Hanes, My size, (on line) for a really good front closing no-wire bra. They aren't expensive ($17) so a I bought a few so I could swap them in and out. they were a Godsend. I had my SAVI port removed about a month ago. My RO said removal shouldn't be bad, but I should take some pain medicine before I came in. I thought that was conflicting advice, and when they tried to take it out there was a LOT of pain. I called a halt and asked that the lidocaine be used (which was used when it went in). It was a breeze after that. I wish I had seen this discussion chain before I went in - I read the SAVI Sisters website and it sounded like a piece of cake. I would have liked to be better prepared. But the good news - once you are healed, there are therapists in light-touch lymphedema breast massage who can help return the breast to a much better state - they can break down tissue that will be scar tissue if nothing is done, and can help remove lymph fluid from the breast. I've had one treatment and it has been a big help. A friend of mine used the service a year ago and has virtually no scare tissue. My therapist was a referral from my breast surgeon and my hospital's Holistic Center. Thanks for writing everyone - it was so good to have some of my issues validated.",
