Whew.  They flushed port, got back blood, hung 2 bags of antinauseas, then Taxotere, then Carboplantin, then Herceptin.  Everything was started slow, then at the sound of the gong, it was turned up a notch, and then at the sound of the gong, it was moved to full pace.  I could not have asked for a more attentive and good team of nurses.  I was first one in, and last one to leave.  People were in and out, more men than women, and several came just for shots.  I overpacked.  They had blankets and pillows, and some colas and Ensures, crackers and pretzels.  No ice, but I had brought my own, and some lip balms, lotions, and lemon drops, snacks, book and magazines. Still at end of day, I just wanted to kick back and lay still.  Tonight I am tired.  No nausea or headache.  Ate mac and cheese, and lots of fruit tea , and took a long nap.  Not at all like I pictured.  Much simplier, efficent, and, I don't know how to describe, but sort of not personal.  I didn't get weepy or reflective or spirtual, and I am spiritual.  It was something I just had to do, and now I  only have to do it five more times.  I think I took some power back while sitting there.  I told cancer, ha ha, just wait and see what kind of night you have tonight.  Never mind about mine.   I hope everyone's went as well.  Can only wait and see what happens.  That's one of the things I hate the most about cancer.  Love to all.   ",

Pup was an abused, neglected dog when we adopted him.  He was a red border collie, and had spent most of his youth in a cage.  It took time to win his trust, and after two years he was happy and becoming confident in all people.  We had spent that afternoon on our farm.  He had ran madly and jumped and romped in our ponds, much to our laughing delight, and had chased the cattle.  We were coming through a gate in our truck.  I think he nipped at the tires.  I don't really know what happened.  But the results were horrific and I am having a lot of trouble with flashbacks and all.  My poor husband and I have cried more than I can ever remember.  I had to explain to a four year old what had happened and ended up having to tell him Pup was in heaven. The other thing about this is, I got mad at God............I have tried so hard not to question \"why\" about my own illness.  I felt sure when I was diagnosed that God had a plan for me, and that we would walk this path together.  But as soon as this happened, I got mad.  I can't understand why such a mean thing had to happen.......I know that doesn't make a lot of sense, but it really infuriated me, and I still am having a problem with it.  My emotions are all out of hand.  But you would think getting Cancer would be enough for any of us.  My dog, my husband ( had a Tetanus shot and wound clean) and my grandson really didn't deserve this.........thanks for letting me vent.",

Any thoughts or plans out there?

Today I had my port wound closed with stitches.  They took it out last Tuesday, it was infected, but left the pocket open, and packed it with idoform gauze.  They removed and repacked it Thursday.  This a.m. they removed the packing and stitiched it closed.  It was not pleasant.  They have to stitch deeply to close the pocket and despite a little numbing  shot, there was a lot of tugging and  pain.  There are lots of advantages to having it removed and closed under IV anesthesia.  But it's done, and the stitches will dissolve so I don't have to make any more trips to radiology.  I also had my very last infusion afterwards.  I had Herceptin.  My viens are not so good since I got sick last week and it took a couple of tries, but I had it via IV.  Once it was over all the nurses call in clapping and congratulating me, with a Certificate of Graduation from Chemotherapy.  It was a card signed by everyone there at the clinic.  I got out the door on the way  to the car, and just brust into uncontollable sobs.   It's 19 degrees here and my tears froze to my eyes, but there was just such a rush of relief.....I wish it for all of you.  I will have  a 6 week wash out, then I will enter the Tykerb clincal trial instead of taking Herceptin.  It is an oral medication.  I will also take Tamoxifen which is also oral.  I hope and pray never to be in an infusion room again. and I know you all understand. ",

I had my powerport placed yesterday, and I was surprised that it is placed so high.  It is almost at my collarbone.  I am wondering, goejsen, if yours is too.  I really expected it to be lower and nearer my sternum.  It hurt.  A lot of the problem was the way it was dressed.  They put that clear plastic sheet on very tightly and it was tugging on my neck.  They redressed it once I got back to the SameDaySurgery bed, and last night I redressed it myself with as little tape as possible. It is better but I will be glad when it toughens up.  I had Muga and Bonescan too. I was told to keep it dry for 7-10 days.  Any tips for showering around this thing?   I have first chemo Monday.  Onc asked to do first one on Monday, saying this way he knew I would be able to get back into office during the week if necessary.  He said it could take as much as 4 hours as my port would be fresh and they would give drugs slower the first time watching for any reactions, etc. I have delayed returning to work until the week after chemo.  I am a bit worried about returning to work.  I do detailed work, with extremely high production and quality standards. I am just hoping I can keep up.  How are others faring in the work environment.  I am able to work from home.  I do health information analysis and coding.  Any others out there? ",

Yah.  The infusion was about one and one half hours shorter.  Herceptin now only takes 30 minutes now, instead of 90 minutes first time and Taxotere and Carboplantin each took 30 minutes less.  I think this really helped.  I am tired but I don't, at this point, have sludge mouth, although smells are bothering me some.  I drank and drank like always and did eat celery as advised by my survivor friend trying to get all this poison out of me.  And I am watching for constipation vs diarrhea because I let that slip up on me last time.  I guess I am just being more proactive, and feeling a little more understanding and in control. I am taking steriods for a little longer and tapering off instead of just quitting Day 3.  I believe I did a major crash last time, and hopefully I will survive better.  I have a great team working with me and they really listen and take action.  I feel like I am being well supported and cared for.  It really makes a difference and I am so sorry when I read about some of the things you others have experienced. I have been surprised by the reactions my diagnosis has made to others in my life.  I knew there would be those who would not be able to stay close.  In my family I have to admit we do what we have to but not so much more.  We don't lack compassion, but really just never had people skills necessary to be of any real help.  It's sad and we are all learning.  But my sis has really been there. I had a high school reunion the week of my surgery, and got lots of calls from people I would never have heard from at all but for that.  I still hear from 2 of those people.  People at work have been great, and I have two cousins who have experienced this for themselves and they have been great resources.  So just now I have a mom who calls every week or so because she doesn't want to bother me (she's 80 and she's ill and she gets an excuse), and I have a mother in law whom I know for the first 20 years of my marriage wished I would fall off the earth and now is here cooking and cleaning and truly concerned for my welfare.  My how that has changed.  I guess everytime someone extends me a kindness now, I am so, so gratified.  And I try so hard now to pass it on.  Yesterday there was a woman waiting to get back to the treatment room at the ONC and she started to cry and before I could think I was up asking what she needed and banging on the counter to get her back for some comfort (steriods, yes maybe).  But I do bellieve there are those who just do the best they can, and we take it for what it's worth and expect little more.  We all have so much to be concerned with.  Let it go if you can and look for those in your life that can and will help us though this life that we never expected to be living.",

Like you I try to involve myself in activities to preoccupy my mind and time, but like you, I'm constantly aware of the others and just can't miss some of the signs and symptoms of their care.  Just don't like it at all.  What a strange situation to have ended up in............. I found out yesterday my Clinical Trial Nurse is leaving and won't be there next chemo.  I am so bummed out.  Beth was the best.  She was my go to person.  She always got answers, she always took time, followed up, and she remembered so I didn't have to tell the same things 12 different times. I already miss her. I also told the staff about the girl brusing my port access in Lebanon.  They said the knew there was a new person there, \" a different kind of nurse\".  What does that mean?? Also said she would get better, but I have decided not at my expense.  I have made a pot of coffee and it actually smells good......Just took my Emend and my steroids.  Did better last time when they extended my steroids and tapered slowly.  Hope it works better this time.  Just know the first time was horrible.  I literally could not raise my head, and was having some really morbid thoughts.  Those of you who crash so badly might want to ask about a slower taper.  Take care of yourselves and feel better.",

I completed my last round of chemo today.  Number 6 TCH.  I can hardly believe it.  I was surprised to learn I still have to do my next 2 rounds of Herceptin and Neulasta tomorrow.  I thought I was done with that too, but I have to have 28 weeks of Herceptin for my clinical study protocol.  I see my ONC in 4 weeks, but after my last Herceptin I will have a 6 week clear out period, with no drugs at all.  I then will start my Tykerb and the Tamoxifin, both which are oral meds.  I can have my port out but ONC recommends to do it at reconstruction.  I am not sure when I will have enough time accrued to do that now.  It will probably be summer. By the way, my fooby is not doing well.  My TE has slipped so that it is more under my arm than centered on my chest.  The PS says it will be an easy fix at reconstruction.  But nothing to be done before.  I am sleeping mostly on my left side (right mastectomy), with a pillow wedged under my chin then down between my breasts, allowing my fooby to rest on top along with my arm.  It is a very uncomfortable situation.  I can \"sling\" it back into place but it will not stay.  It is the worst at night when without thinking I wind up on my back and the fooby just falls off my chest and slides under my arm....yuck... And our insurance is changing from Humana to Atnea at the first of the year.  It will cost about $60 more per month.  Our deductible is up $1000, to $4000 individual/$8000 family.  $50 copays just about every encounter type now, and basically 80/20% for any doctor.  whew...I still can't find my PS or BS on the abbreviated list of providers they have forwarded to us.... Still I am done with this part of the journey and I am so happy to be done.  My goal next year is to get as healthy as I can.  I want to lose 50 pounds whenever it becomes safe to do so.  I am wondering when my \"moon face\" caused by steriods will go away.  I don't have any hair and my eyebrows fell out this past round....I just want to be me again... Thanks for understanding and accepting.  I have shared so much with this group.  I have started attending a support group with about 40 real people, but cannot imagine being so candid there. Thanks Lizziemack for starting us up.  Despite the fact we all are going to complete our therapies, I don't think this discussion should ever be complete....",

I had Taxotere and Carboplatin last Monday.  I thought it was going to be better, but in fact this round I have had more just overt nausea and cannot find foods that really sooth.  Everything is too sweet, salty, greasy.  It just combines with this God Awful taste in my mouth, and makes it worse.  And I hurt in my bones worse, and am so, so tired.  I think many of us must be getting the cumulative effects.  I thought just because I am now 4 out of 6, it would seem easier--be better, but it's not.  I too just wish I could walk away from all this,  I am so fed up.  I am so tired of being sick, and although I have only  \"2 to go\" (and the cheerleading has begun), at this particular moment, it doesn't help a bit. I am on medical leave.  I drew my last paid time off this week.  I will be paying 102% of my health insurance out of pocket this payroll period.  It distresses me, but I was not prepared to jump into and try to hold a job as detailed and demanding as mine. We are audited without mercy, and must hold a 95/95 accuracy and production stat.  If I had 3 more weeks of medical leave I could get all my chemotherapy treatments done.  As it is, I will try to return to work intermittently to build up enough time off to get me through that last chemo week.  If I do not return to work by November 31, I will lose my job.  So, all my efforts will be toward that.  How I would like to be able to just sit back and care for myself, do all my chemos, and get my reconstruction and get this damn port out.....but it just doesn't work that way.  And one more thing, while I'm on this jag, in the onc clinic a couple of weeks ago, I was telling the head nurse how bad I had felt.  \"It sucks\", I said.  This must have been one of the most delicate southern ladies I have ever had the misfortune to meet, because, she says,  \"you know, saying it sucks can have many meanings, some not so nice, so I just say \"it vaccumns\"..................I didn't know whether to laugh, cry or slap her......she hasn't had it, and believe me.....it sucks.",

Still I think of all things, I dread the port placement and having that foreign object in me for so long.  I think it's probably more of a mind thing--my husband had a PICC twice for recurring sepsis after shoulder replacement.  I hated it so.  But it was a totally different situation in all respects.  I just have to work through it.  It's so good to hear from you, and I have learned so much about preping for chemo here.  It really helps.",

Some of the bumps are really bad, and they certainly won't let us drive.  It's just a hell of a ride, and we'll all just hold on tight till the ride is over.                         ",
