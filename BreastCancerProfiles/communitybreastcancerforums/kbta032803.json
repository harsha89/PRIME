Good luck at your meeting hopefully they can get your plan moving along. Feels a little better once you have a plan of action. Tanisha",

I'm with littleblueflowers I want this behind me, but it will be a long journey after I deliver I get taxol possibly with carboplatin. Then I want a MX and hysterectomy since I'm brca 1 even though they said they don't recommend that until 35 (I'm 28). Just glad to have a place to vent where people actually understand what we're going through unfortunately.",
