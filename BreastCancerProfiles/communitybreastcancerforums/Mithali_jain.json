At that time, her nipple bleaded and for one-two days she concluded that it might had happened because of the tight blouses. She started wearing suit afterwards and guess what the bleading stopped.But due to her stubborn kids,she met the doctor and her doctor examined her breast and told that it was a mere infection and she didn't find any lump..but after 7-8 months, she can feel a small lumo in her left breast. She went to the doctor and the doctor said to her daughter that chances are very rare but we must take precaution and her mammography done today.Reports will be out on tomorrow evening. Her mother died from ovarian cancer. What should she expect. Log in to post a reply",
