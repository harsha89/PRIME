The doctor told her he could save the nipples, but there is a chance that the cancer can come back threw the nipples, so opted not to save the nipples. I know by now you have had your surgery, but I had to answer. I had my surgery April 5th. I only had the lump removed in the right side. I did have radiation, which wasn't so bad. I go for my first check up Aug 12th. I don't know if I will get an answer back, but did you have much pain after surgery? My daughter is a little scared going into this surgery. She is only 39 years old. This just came out of the blue to her and it has hit her hard. They are not going to do her reconstruction until she heals from this and the skins is stretched, then they will do her implants. I wondered if there is a lot of pain after surgery? She will not receive chemo or radiation. Thanks!",
