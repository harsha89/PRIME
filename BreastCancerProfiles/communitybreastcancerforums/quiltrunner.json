I just finished chemo today. Radiation is next. It is a nightmare BUT you can do it! You will find more strength than you thought you had. Let your friends and family help you through this. Upon finishing my chemo today I realize while it has not been a picnic, it wasn't as horrible as I imagined it would be in the initial stages of diagnosis. Go for walks and try and get some exercise if you can. It will help clear your mind and you might sleep a little bit better and have a clearer mind to deal with the immense amount of information and decisions ahead. I'm so sorry you are here. But this forum has some great support and information to help get you through it. You are entitled to be scared, sad, angry, scream and cry, or how ever else you feel. But don't allow yourself to wallow in the pain. Turn it into positive energy that you are going to need to fight the battle! Dive into the resources on this site. Try and rest and know I am praying for you to have some peace and strength. These are the hardest days! It does get better. Some days suck harder than others but you can do it - show others behind you how to do it with some swag!!!",

Now, where do I go to get a response as to why I can't do the tummy flap reconstruction after having a mini-tummy tuck (only removed loose skin, not muscle).  I'm having difficulty getting an answer to that question.  I got an infection after immediate reconstruction and ended up having both side deconstructed.  Now having radiation.  I know my options are now limited for reconstruction, but I'd much rather use the tummy flap than the Lat flap!  Anyone know where I can go to find out?",
