I was thinking about your situation from my (an employers) point of view. Most of us bosses hate change. Once we have staff that a/ enjoy their jobs and b/ are good at it and c/ are reliable and trustworthy, we hate to lose them. Presenting your employers with a viable option which saves them money could be worthwhile. Think about exactly what hours you could do (perhaps a 10am start would make your offer more enticing to them) and  present them with a worksheet of your wages and the costs of them hiring someone to work 7am to 10 or 11am. There are many people out there who would love to work a few hours a day to supplement their income. Alternatively just because something has always been a certain way doesnt mean it has to stay that way. Is there another staff member available who can check in the subs etc? eg, if another secretary or admin officer starts work at 9am, can they start at 7 and leave earlier, you start at 10 or 11 and if they have tasks that must be completed in their usual last few hours, you include those tasks in your work routine?  From all the posts Ive read of yours, I have no doubt you are a super efficient sort of person who may well be capable of adding a few extra tasks to your work day and still finish on time. The last option is a true job share arrangement. My sister is the secretary of a local school where I live and she initially shared her job with another lady. Everyone was happy and the job only became full time when the other lady retired. The pay from an employers point of view was the same or very similiar and the bottom line is, the job was done well and as 2 ladies were sharing, in the event of sickness, the other could be called on which caused much less disruption in the office. Presenting your choice of the above in the most advantageous terms to your bosses, including the perks to them, may well mean you could keep your job, on your terms and for as long as you choose to work. Us bosses sometimes just need to have the advantages and new ideas pointed out to us. Personally in view of your experience and dedication to work, I think they'd be idiots to risk losing you.",

It sure hurt a heap and I had it for ages before telling my mum, secretly worrying I had Breast Cancer. None of us could say definately that you dont have breast cancer, but we can say the odds are extremely stacked in favour of it NOT being breast cancer due to your age. If you dont have a history of breast cancer in your family, the odds improve even more.  Only getting it checked out fully will answer your question properly though. Please see your doctor and have it checked out so you can stop worrying.  I wasted quite a lot of time on and off worrying about that dang lump back then and seeing as youve been doing the same for 2 years, its time to get it checked out so you can move forward with enjoying all that life has to offer you.",

Tell him you are really worried as you have had it so long and ask him as to whether he can authorise an ultrasound or whether he can recommend some other doctor so that you can find out exactly what it is.  I hope you dont have to wait too long before you see the doctor. 2 years of worry is enough and with a baby on his/her way, you dont need the additional stress of the lump bringing you down emotionally.

Please try to take a few breaths. Her2+ is such a better diagnosis now then it used to be. The development of a drug called Herceptin has changed the prognosis so much as many women here can attest to. Please dont do anymore googling as the sites brought up are always the sites that have received the most hits which means the older sites generally come up first. The stats on BC and also on Her2+ are so outdated now they dont even come close to being true anymore. Spend some time on the forums here and ask any questions you need to as you learn more. Theres so many women here that we encompass all aspects of Breast Cancer and Im sure you will find many have been where you are and can help you understand what lies ahead. We will need some more information from you when you are able to supply it. Your pathology report has a lot of important information we can help you decipher and understand. Seriously honey, try to relax as much as you can. Its such a shock for the first little while, but this forum has a lot of current information and some of the best ladies going who can help you as only people who have been in your shoes can.  If you click on http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/80 - thats an entire forum here dedicated to Her2+ and its much better to read through its information than to just google and find outdated information . I hope  you know you can rely on all of us to help you through.",

I had I think around 9 lymphs removed at the first surgery and the combination made it very difficult to lift the arm on that side. I did the exercises they gave me religiously almost from when I woke up after the surgery - simple things like clenching that hand, lifting the hand at the wrist and then as I became more mobile, climbing my fingers up a wall, slowly getting higher until I had full mobility of the arm (took a few months). If your anything like me, you will just instinctively protect that side of your body from all comers (especially the big dogs)  within a month you'll be back to almost normal (I say almost because if you have any lymphs removed you will always have to be careful with what you lift on that side). Keep the big dogs away until the drains are removed and be gentle with yourself for the month. The tightness and numbness takes ages to wear off, but with doing the exercises they give you regularly, it will ease over time. If it helps, I was sent up to the ward about 10pm after the mx and at midnight I had the nurse help me to the ensuite toilet (no way I was going potty in a bedpan eww), I also got a look at my chest and could come to grips with my new \"look\" of flatness. At 7.30am I along with all the crap they hooked me up to was shuffling down to the smoking area located on the roadside of the hospital for a cigarette. It was about a 200 metre walk and It cant have been too painful or I wouldnt have made it out of bed hey. I accepted the pain killers they gave me while I was in hospital (2 nights) but didnt take any once I got home. We are all different, but for me, I have had more pain from a toothache or a sprained ankle.  The tightness and numbness sucked a bit, but after a while I couldnt feel it unless I actually concentrated on it (hope that makes sense).  If I may, Id like to finish by suggesting you get up and about as soon as you can manage safely after the surgery. In my case, because I was a smoker, I was desperate to get outside to smoke, so I pushed myself I guess. I found most of the other patients, all of whom had their ops before mine that day, struggled more than I did and I think it was because they stayed in bed too long. Admittedly I was a good 10 years younger than them though. Good luck",

One thing I think you must do is tell your dh (hubby) to lay off on the doom stuff. Tell him theres no point in worrying about something that may never happen and that he's causing you to stress out. Even if it does turn out to be BC, as youve seen from these forums, there are many of us who have been dx'd (diagnosed) gone through tx (treatment) and come out the other side and gone on to live our lives normally. While you need to be able to talk things through with your dh, him automatically thinking the worst is not good for either of you. I know its an inherrent trait of his (I used to be married to a pessimist and wasnt divorced because of the pessimism lol)  but he CAN work on it and still keep the lines of communication open between the two of you, without causing you so much stress.  You do sound very level headed and grounded to me and given a chance you can get through this period of time well Im sure.  Sincerely hoping that its something benign and that you get results quickly so that you can put this behind you. My apologises if this comes across as too critical of your DH, I just think he needs to be there for you and not contributing to your stress levels. Im sure he's wonderful in every other way lol.",

The pathology results will have the status of the margins, lymph nodes, staging and hormone status, so the BS needs to wait until he/she has received that information and met with you before he can give you a referral to an oncologist. He will most likely outline your treatment options to you. In addition you both need to be fully healed from your surgeries before you undergo either chemo, radiation or the commencement of hormonal therapy. You both have at least a month to 6 weeks of recovery I would imagine before any treatment would start so from a medical viewpoint, the week or two in waiting for the pathology results and BS appointment does not affect anything. Its hard on the nerves though I know. I hope you can both relax and recover as best you can and that you both receive good news in your path results. BTW dont underestimate the value in having one of those body pillows. Not sure what they are called in our various countries, but either the V or just the long straight one on either side of you in bed does help keep you from rolling onto your sore areas - least it did for me.

My dx of BC at the age of 42 had nothing to do with that previous breast pain. I came to the conclusion it was hormonal changes in the breast as the breasts were starting to sag a bit combined with my bad habit of not wearing a bra when at home which was all the time back then lol. I say I came to the conclusion cause the dr's were of no help at all at the time. They just told me not to worry about it and sent me on my way. Keep your appointment at the breast clinic and if after they do their tests they say there's nothing to worry about, ask them what you can do to help alleviate the pain as Im sure they have had many women in there with the same complaints.",

First off Ive never regretted have the fibroadenoma removed back when I was 22. As it turns out 3 years ago when I had the masectomy for the dcis, they found micro invasive IDC hiding in a previously unseen fibroadenoma. In my opinion based on this, I would suggest the removal of the fibroadenoma if that is what the surgeons are urging you to do. My opinion is that a little scar is worth having the peace of mind of knowing you dont have BC, at least it was and is to me. Funnily enough the breast I had the fibroadenoma removed from 23 years ago is the breast I still have.  I cant help you with painful lumps as I had absolutely no pain associated with my dcis and idc and the dx was completely out of the blue. I hope some others can come on and give you their experiences to help you find your answers",

Fast forward 20 years and I went along to the local breast clinic for a mammogram which are offered free to australian woman over 40. I had no symptoms, no pain, nothing. A week later I was called back to get a magnified mammogram as they had found a large amount of microcalcifications in my mammogram. I went along and they did the magnified mammogram, then the core biopsy and they showed me the films and even I could see that I had microcalcifications in such lage quantity scattered all over my left breast that there would be no option but to have a masectomy.Those microcalicifications are a standard indicator of dcis. 2 weeks later I had my masectomy and SNB with either 7 or 9 lymphs being removed. The pathology came back and IDC was found hiding in a previously unseen and unsuspected fibroedenoma along with micro in a lymph on the outskirts of what they had taken. So a week later back in to have more lymphs removed for greater clearance and thankfully those extra 10 or 11 came back clear. The fibroidenoma didnt cause BC - the dcis I had was grade 3, very fast growing and it broke through the milk ducts and infiltrated the fibroidenoma as it was hunting for places to expand into. Same with the surrounding breast tissue and lymph. Hope that clarifies my experiences and helps you make some decisions.",

I saw my mammograms and could see 3 large areas of microcalcifications in different areas of the one breast. They took the core biopsy at the time and it showed dcis grade 3. The masectomy was scheduled from those results because that is the standard practice when dealing with dcis, specially grade 3. Post masectomy, they biopsied the breast tissue and SNB and they found IDC grade 2, one lot hidden in a fibroidenoma that was too deep to have been seen previously on the mammogram, a little in the breast tissue and a little in the lymph. http://breastcancer.about.com/od/mammograms/p/calcifications.htm explains calcifications pretty well Hope this all helps you",

I havent even been doing the massages lately as I havent had the tinge of pain which is always the precurser before it flares.  I do work that is physically demanding on my arms in particular and that hasnt changed, so I can only assume one of the following has worked to stop the build up in my tissues. 1/ changed from standard pharmaceutical calcium in a solid pill to green calcium in a liquid capsule - I take 2 a day. 2/ a very expensive probiotic - which Ive never taken before in my life and dont know much about but take religiously now 3/ was advised to change from using margarine to butter which hasnt been hard to do. Im still taking my arimidex and though they gave me other pills and diet change advice the above are the only changes Ive actually made. The arimidex, 2 calcium and the probiotic along with a 3mg melatonin to help me sleep are the only pills I take and I take them at night.

I was called back a week later as they found some microcalcifications and wanted a closer look. Oddly I still wasnt worried as i got onto google and saw that it could still be no major problem. By the time I left the breastscreen clinic after that second visit, I knew I had DCIS, they had taken core biopsies and I had seen the mammograms and could tell that there was no way I wasnt going to lose my breast cause it was in several clusters. My Breast Surgeon was so funny when I had my appointment with him. I could see him gearing himself up to tell me \"devastating news\" and before he could I said to him, dont worry mate, I know the breast has to go. The look on his face was priceless. He was so relieved lol. By that time I knew it was a form of BC, and all I knew was that I wanted it out of me that instant. I even paid to get it removed quicker than our public hospital system would allow as the pathology had come back saying it was the grade 3 which means very fast growing and I was diagnosed just before xmas when most of the hospitals here are cutting down and sending staff and dr's on holidays  Only once they had taken the breast off and biopsied it did they find the IDC. I count myself very very lucky to be alive and in good health I can tell you. I also think the experience I had when I was 22 with the fibroadenoma helped to make me cope with my BC very calmly.  Im just greatful that Australia has a policy that any woman over the age of 40 can have a free mammogram every 2 years. I missed doing it the first time through laziness. If I hadnt bothered till I was 50 Im fairly certain based on the grade and stage of my BC that I would have been in very severe trouble by then.",

To me it makes sense that with the liquid calcium going to my bones and not flooding my tissue like the other ones Ive been taking for 3 years did, I would have improved circulation. I have a bone density scan coming up next month and then the usual mammo, us and blood tests in November so it will be interesting to see if the improved absorption of calcium via the liquid capsules shows results.

'In situ' means 'in place. DCIS is a non-invasive breast cancer. The abnormal cells are contained inside the milk ducts. What's the difference between DCIS and invasive breast cancer? The abnormal cells seen in DCIS are cancer cells. However, DCIS is not breast cancer as we commonly understand it. In breast cancer, the cancer cells have spread out of the milk ducts into the surrounding breast tissue. That is why it's sometimes called \u2018invasive' breast cancer. A woman cannot die from DCIS unless it develops into invasive breast cancer. As it turns out I did have some invasive which is what was hiding in the unseen fibroidenoma. The two conditions are vastly different. From what Ive googled on your condition, so long as theres no atypical hyperplasia in there, you should be fine. Im no expert. Ive simply googled your condition and had no previous knowledge of it. Personally if the dr's are keen to remove it,  I would let them so hopefully you can get back to life not worrying about BC.

My understanding is that when women are young their breasts are extremely dense and this generally slackens off as our hormones change as we age ( the result is us older women end up with sagging breasts). Its the reason why generally women under 40 dont get referred for mammograms. Your BS is on the job and presumably is good at his job and he will advise you of what he believes to be the necessary next step for you. Off hand I would think a biopsy which isnt painful and is over fairly quickly. It could well be a benign cyst or fibroidenoma with no further action being required. Im sure others have already told you that 80% or so of lumps are found to be benign and theres no reason to think you wont fall into the category. I hope this message is coming across the way I intend it to. You have reason to be worried and I dont want you to think im rubbishing your real and valid concerns, but worrying and being upset over the next week isnt going to change the results nor make the time go faster. Im just hoping you can somehow put it out of your mind enough so that it doesnt make you ill or depressed for now. Keep in mind that you are young and the odds of it being BC and not a cyst or fibroidenoma are very small. Sending you warm cyber hugs and sincere best wishes for benign results and peace of mind.",

Im my case, my veins deteriorated rapidly after each chemo tx so when I went for my 3rd tx, after 3 or 4 attempts at getting an iv in, the head nurse called my onc who sent me home without tx. My arm was bruised badly and apparently it is standard procedure to not try to find a vein more than that. They organised a piccline for a week or so later with the 3rd chemo a few days after that. I ended up in the er with blood clots a couple of nights later which meant 6 months of nightly injections of claxane in my belly  and a port before the 4th round of chemo. The rest of chemo was a breeze once I had the port and if I ever have to do chemo again, Im getting another port inserted first. As a side note, most blood drawers can find a vein now, but I went for at least 2 years with them having to draw blood from my hand as the veins in my one available arm were still shot. Not to mention the op for the port meant they had to insert the iv in my foot and that experience is up there as one of the most painful things I have ever endured and never want to go through again lol. Not wanting to give you nightmares, just wanted to let you know what can happen so you can make an educated decision.  I personally look back very very fondly on having a port and it seriously was the easiest of all the ops and procedures I went through back then. ",

I see my oncologist the alternating 6 months unless I need an adjustment in hormonal/bone strengthening treatment  in the meantime. Your friends BS hasnt seen her since surgery because he handed her over to the oncologist for chemo and radiation, and now its a year post initial dx (diagnosis) she's actually slightly overdue for her first annual mammogram and ultrasound post surgery and treatment. BS's have vast experience in reading our mamograms and ultrasounds and in my case the BS is the primary dr on my medical team. Far as I know my onc has never even seen my mammo's and ultrasounds cause her job is to supply the adjuvant therapy. For me its vital to see my BS every 6 months. He is the one who organises the blood tests, mammos and us's and to tell me congratulations its another year and your still NED (No Evidence of Disease)  If its the same system in your country, she should be having her mammo and ultrasound a week or two prior to her appointment with the BS and taking those results along with her. If the distance is too great, perhaps her BS can refer her to a more local one that can take over, but personally I have the utmost faith in my BS and wouldnt change to another. BTW I know the radiologists issue reports which we read anyway, but having a BS also checking every mammo and ultrasound photo is an extra safety measure so that recurrance isnt missed by a techie.

Im on arimidex for 5 years and was 42 at the time of dx. What made up my mind for me was that not so long ago they didnt have the ability to detect micromets. My father had a melonoma about 20 years ago and then a few years later had his lymph nodes removed and biopsied, they detected no mets so he didnt have chemo and died 5 years later of a brain tumour that grew so large and quickly as to be inoperable. Rightly or wrongly I believe that if it had happened with our current technology, the mets would have been found, my father would have done chemo and could well be alive today. Your the dr not me, but I feel we are still on the frontlines of micromets and neither we nor the most experienced BS knows whether  micromets do indeed prosper and become full blown mets. But my experience with my father not doing chemo has influenced me into believing they are as important to treat with chemo as any other met, if for no other reason than for peace of mind. If you have preexisting medical conditions that could impact on the long term side effects, then I would recommend gaining a second and third opinion from highly qualified Onc's and then make your decision taking it all into account. Im sorry you joined us here in BCO, but welcome. There are so many wonderful ladies and men who can help you through anything that comes up. The support here is truly amazing.",

I just wanted to clarify that according to her previous posts in the forum, Nataliya means that her mum was dx'd with extensive bone mets 2 months ago, with her lungs being checked closely at the time as they were looking for her primary. So as of 2 months ago no lung mets according to ct's. This typo could impact on the advice you ladies have to give Nataliya.",
