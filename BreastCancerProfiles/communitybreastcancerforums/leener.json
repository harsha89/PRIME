It stayed in for another 4 1/2 weeks and then was pulled about 1 1/2 weeks ago. More fluid is now collecting again, and he wants to put in some sort of a vacuum with sponges that will need to be changed, so I'll be open. Has anyone had this done? Log in to post a reply",

He has me scheduled for the nipple reconstruction on 5/30. He'll be using some of the excess skin on the sideds of my pedicule tummy scar. Not sure if this fluid issue will hod me up or not. RE the hot flashes. I live in FL and these have been a huge issue for me. I take 1 1/2 tabs of clonodine 2x daily for this. VItamin E and Neuronton were also recommended for me. Do you suffer tremors from the Tamoxifen?",
