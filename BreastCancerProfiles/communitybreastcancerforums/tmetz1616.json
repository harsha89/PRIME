I appreciate all of your replies.  I just feel like I want quality of life at this point.  I am 31..  when I was taking tamoxifen, my bones ached all the time, my joints hurt every morning I woke up and during the night I constantly was awakened with severe leg cramps.  I felt like I was 80, not a 31 year old woman.  It's so hard for me to try taking this pill again knowing how horrible it made me feel.  Emotionally recovering is hard enough and right now I finally feel good physically again, I don't want that to go away.  To me, I feel like if cancer is coming back, it will, regardless of tamoxifen or not.  Maybe that sounds crazy, but I'm sick of thinking about cancer... and every time I take that pill, it reminds me.  There has got to be other methods.. Thank you for sharing the info on DIM mclark55 :)",
