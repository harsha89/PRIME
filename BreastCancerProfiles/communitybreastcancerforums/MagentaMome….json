Our heads are literally spinning around and its so difficult to wrap your brain around all of this information. I suppose with that said though.. it makes me question the false negatives that can result from a mammo. The lumps were noticed and created the need for further testing. If the lumps were not present then these masses would have continued undetected. It may a bit concern seeing that I am scheduled for my mammo next Wednesday and can only pray the a negative mammo is indeed that. Uh... it seems so much. Thank you again.",

The reason I ask.. my sister's twin just had her mammo last Saturday and they saw \"something\". She now has to get a MRI... and I would like to offer some points of consideration to assist in her in scheduling the test for the more reliable reading. Thk U so much.",
