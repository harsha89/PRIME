      "Content": "Dec 24, 2008 06:27AM - edited Dec 24, 2008 06:28AM by LynnW Hi Renee Ive taken so far chem when I first got breast cancer. Both sides removed with reconstruction ,, implants.  Not very comfortable. Then radiation,, then arimidex for 3 years. Came back in the bone so we tried Flasodex for 3 months. There was progression ...two small 8 mm spots on my liver and my neck has palpatable pea like lymph node involvement on the right side.  We are now going to do the taxotere,, but it seems like nothing is working. I'm not Her + but I am Er and Pr +.  Had my ovaries removed and genetic testing which stated 80% negative for the BRC1 gene.  But,,, my mother had breast cancer and passed 20 years ago. at the age of 46. I'm 46 now.  Frankly it seems like it was meant to be. I do try to stay positive as much as I can but lately,, last few months,, my joints have ached so bad I can barely climb out of bed. I've quit work and am laying around now,, hoping stress free living would help the pain,, but all it does is remind me I'm no longer productive. We are hoping the taxotere will help slow things down and make me feel a bit better.  Last week I had a shot of something to bring up my Hemogloban. But it hasn't kicked in yet. I'm actually taking 1/2 bottle of the 5 hour energy stuff that everyone is gulping down lately. It helps me stay away at night instead of sleeping on the sofa at 8:00 pm.  I'm so grateful for all your input here about the chemo.  I expected hair loss like last time and I felt awful the last time about 3 days after,, but I was on CEF so maybe a bit different.  I've gone and picked out my wig. Real hair this time. They cut and style it on Saturday. Then I think I'll just go ahead and shave my own hair off and get it over with. Some people have mentioned anti depressants. I think I'll ask my family doc about them,, but I feel the only thing that will help my depression is to get well. lol  You know what I mean?  I wish the joint aches would vanish. My oncology nurse mentioned the flasodex and bone building stuff would cause it too,, but I didn't take my last flasodex shot so don't know why its worse. Would the cancer affect my joints like this. Even  my wrist as I type is painful. Warm shower helps in the morning but I fear the day when I won't be able to get to the shower at all. This is scarey stuff.  Your all so brave and have such a great outlook. I'm learning from you and there is safety in numbers here I think. Not a good place to have safety in numbers but it does help.  ttyl Huggs and merry christmas to everyone. Lynn",

Before that it was only in my bones.  Does that mean the Flasodex failed me?  I'm only getting chemo now and I don't understand why I don't get something to stop the estrogen too since I'm er and pr ++ So many questions... geeesh.  I also have slight lymphodema in my right hand again after six months where I was ok.  I blame it on gardening without gloves. My bad.  Its only the back of my hand and a bit in my forearm but it gets me down that something else is haunting me.  I want a peaceful summer. I just can't decide how to do it.   I can't beleive some of you have had 24 chemo sessions.  Does it continue to get rid of some cancer.  If so its worth it and I'll keep plugging on but hope that a break won't hurt me that much. thanks for listening Lynn",

Some ladies here have had good luck with Flasodex. My canacer was Estrogen and Progesterone positive so they hoped it woud do something but it didn't and the cancer progressed from my bone to my liver. I look back and sometimes think I shouldnt have been so frightened of the chemo,, but if I had it to do all over again I would make the same decision because QOL was important to me. We never know until we try.  What works for some doesn't for others and it makes no sense.  This is why cancer is so hard to find a cure for I guess. Huggs and good luck to you all.

I know she's still alive but could she still be alive without all of that poison and pain. One wonders.  I am grateful that I was diagnosed 4 1/2 years ago. Unlike her as its only been two years. But I look at it that she's getting it all over with quickly where as mine is dragging out slowly but to the same end. Some people enjoy the time they are receiving.  Maybe thats the difference. For me aach day is frightening and its a struggle to look forward to the next.  I get small joys from time to time but they are over shadowed by the fact I won't have them for many many years.  Mary your story of 10 years is hopeful for us.  Wish i felt like I could keep going like this for 10 years but the reality is I don't feel like that and deep down I'm not sure i want to.   Dianne I too feel pathetic complaining when you can't even walk.  I suppose  for each of us this disease brings its own handicap. I can still drive and walk yet my fatigue has robbed me of daily things that I could once do. Its also caused depression and anxiety that weren't there before.  I've lost friends and freedom and that innocent naive attitude that made life feel like it was going on forever.   I'm glad I'm called stable,,, but pissed that it won't mean much in about 6 months.  Some people might think I'm negative. Actually i'm not. I'm realistic and i find that I won't be shattered when the next bomb drops.  Its my way of protecting myself I suppose.  I wish pain free days for all of my sisters.  Comfort is our goal here ,,, and the opportunity to laugh from time to time.  Maybe tomorrow I can come back on here and make you all laugh.

They are not accurate.  My hand today is swollen as well my knuckles and my forearm a bit.  I rub it and try to wrap it but it never stays on properly.  I went last year for massage and it helped and was going to get measured for a sleeve for a trip i was taking but then the cancer came back and all the plans got lost in the shuffle.  I should go back to get the therapist to massage it back out and get the sleeve. I have breast surgery next wednesday for a reconstruction fix,, and so the massage will have to wait until after that.  Next monday is my next chemo.  I've had a week extra break since the surgery is scheduled,, but back at it as soon as its over. I'd like a longer break but afraid to take it..... in case of progression.  Its gotten rid of one spot on my liver and theres one more I'd like to have vanish.  My bone scan was stable last month as well.  You give me hope when you said eleven years at stage 4.  Way to go woman.  I wish I could follow in your footsteps but who knows.  psl. they stopped the Flasodex when chemo started because she said they weren't sure if it affected the chemo or not. hmmmm I should ask more questions.  I agree that I'm er and pr positive and the estrogen should be monitored.  I have no ovaries though.

Today I went for the results of my re scans from 3 months ago. Since that short time where it was in my bones,,, apparently there are two tiny spots now on my liver, and the lymph nodes in my neck that I can feel,,, are cancer too. Taxotere. Thats the word of the day today. I start on the 29th of December.  Who here has taken this and was it effective??  I'm not sure what I'm hoping for here as far as dragging this thing out. Is it months,, or a year or two,, or unknown.  That word unknown is also popping up continuously. The only known thing is that I'm getting new symptoms every week.  How could this crap spread so quickly.  Its almost as though the scan itself initiates the whole process.  lol I wasn't as upset as I thought I'd be when the dr told me this today.  Its not that I don't care or have given up,, but I just feel its normal for all this to happen so its no big scare now. The scare is how and when to plan things. I'm going to go to the funeral home this month and talk about plans etc because I don't want my husband having to do it. Maybe its pre mature.. but i've read about  people going down hill fast and I don't want to wait until I can't drive etc.  Funny thing is today is my first day off work.  Husband bought a new camera for me to take pics of the pond and nature so I can paint again. I want to,,, I just can't today. He loves me so much.  He just wants me to \"want\" to stay alive so he keeps buying things. Like this new house,, the most amazing silver and black pre lit christmas tree, new furnishings... etc.    He's going to be heart broken when I'm gone and in the poor house as well. lol  I wish I could think more positively girls. My friends say how positive I am and I scratch my head and wonder who the heck are they talking about. I guess with them Im positive and on this site,, I'm negative. I think you guys can accept and understand where as they can't. Anyway its 1:30 in the morning, I guess its time to hit the hay and call it a day.

I sat with this cancer for two years and by then it had traveled to my lymph nodes on both sides. I had a bilateral masectomy with reconstruction,, chemo,, radiation and armidex for 4 years.. then recently the cancer has returned to my bones. I'm not trying to scare you but I was in the same situation and if I had pushed them initially to check me further then the cancer may not have traveled so far and today I wouldn't be making end of life decisions.  Its no time to just take someones word for things.  Doctors make mistakes too.  My tissue was so dense the mammo would barely see through and had to have an ultrasound and then many biopsies of the whole two breasts to check suspisious areas.  Please please,, never think your being paranoid. Its your body,, its your life. Do whats best for you. Ask for an MRI because thats about the only thing that would have found my type of cancer. Good luck to you",

I had about 8 biopsies done ,, very painful.  Whole right breast turned black from bruising. Finally confirmed BC the ductal on the left breast had lobular features so they thought it was until pathology came back. Luck me. Two kinds of cancer.  By the time all of this was diagnosed I had 10 of 19 lymph nodes affected on the right and 3 of 10 on the left. Its now been 4 years and its come back to my bones.  I encourage you to keep doing research and get results.  I knew my body and deep down knew it wasn't right. I blame my doctor several years ago for mis diagnosing the fibrosistic disease.  Its seemed my cancer had been growing for quite some time. They say with lobular that an MRI is the best test to be done.Have you had one yet.  Best of luck,, lynn",

Oh joy. He thinks maybe IBS. I started feeling alot better last week.  some of my old energy was back, No pain. On tuesday I thought to myself I hadn't felt that good since 4 years ago when all of this started.  Then I went home and continued to pack some boxes for our move on November 14th,, and then I got a bit tired. I layed down and my whole body started aching.  Joints,, back , legs head.  Like the flu but no fever. This continued over night and one tylenol 3 wouldn't touch the aches at all. The next morning I dragged my sorry body to work. but only lasted until noon.  I came home and doubled my tylenol  which pretty much put me out but got rid of the aches.  I continued every 4 hours with the tylenol had chattering teeth at one point which sounded like the flu but i'm still not convinced.  I slept ok last night and went to work today,, but I'm so tired and back still cramps up here and there where the cancer is.  I also started having pain in my opposite side rib on Saturday but I'm keeping a eye on it.  I used to get pain in the lower area of left rib cage years ago especially when I would breath so i'm hoping its the same thing and not that the cancer has spread over there.  If it did its extremely fast.  I'm so worried about all of this.  I know alot of you have dealt with this for years but the way my symptoms are right now it seems I'm deteriorating weekly.  How many times am I suppose to go the the doctor. If I do will they scan my again to see if its in my left rib.  ?? Got my records finally from the hospital.  Scan said extensive disperse met to lower mid and upper spine as well as pelvis and right 9th rib. No soft tissue involvement. doesn't sound very good does it. :(  I've had two treatments of Aredia and flasodex,, but not sure flasodex is the way to go. I don't want chemo but its the only thing they 've offered if this doesn't help.  5 rad treatemnts to my mid spine and pelvis.  I'm back this week to...... why me.?  Sorry to be so depressing.  It seems to be happening much too fast.  I know a woman who went 30 years with it in her bones here and there.  Her daughter keeps trying to re assure me but to be frank i think my case is much worse and she was very lucky to have only hot spots thoughout her years.   So,, I m not very optimistic right now.  Just worried that I'll be gone in 6 months.  Another worry is that since rads,, or maybe the flasodex,, when I try to have sex with my hubby,, its tender way inside. Its as though my parts are too small if that makes sense.  Could it be from dryness. I used K Y but the discomfort is way high inside. Thanks for listening and all your help girls. I'm a mess. Lynn",

How could it travel so fast. after 4 years.The scans in August said it hadn't gone to any lymph nodes or vascularly,,, but only a few months later it feels like it has if its in my neck lymp nodes.   I'm so pissed and discouraged.  I'm putting in finally for disability so I don't have to crawl out of the house on cold winter mornings.  But even that feels like I'm giving up. Like I've taken that drastic step into the world of dieing. As long as I could carry on a normal life,, I felt like I was beating it. Now I don't.  I love my new home. God bless my husband for trying to make my life majical. Its a dream home and I can never re pay him for his love and support.  He's scared too. He wants me to feel good. He wants me to smile again,, so we can both forget for a moment,, but I just can't.  I'm too mad. I'm too resentful that this has taken my wonderful future. I'm sure everyone here feels the same way. I needed to vent and I'm sorry for dredging it all up.  Many women here helped me beleive that bone metastesis was more chronic than deadly.  But the last month I feel like its moved on and very fast. I don't want to give up but I don't know how to fight this. Thanks for listening.

I saw a temp oncologist last week since mine was on holidays. He says to wait until I have another attack then go to emergency.  Says this isn't likely cancer since its rare it goes there and that I need a upper GI doctor.  I've made an appointment with my family doctor for Wednesday.  I will ask for a scope of my stomach. Thats all I can do I guess, I've lost 5 lbs in a month and its really worrying me. Thanks for listening to my whining. I just want to get better and worried its more serious.

My husband I think is sick of me being sick lol I finished the rads on Wednesday. I took stepesit,, or something like that and Zofran each visit to control the nausea.  Thursday I was ok,, just a bit colicy. Friday \"again\" I woke up to severe stomach cramps and diharea started. It was yellow and mucus (sorry for the description)  By noon I was crying because Im very sick of this.  Maybe this time its from the radiation but I started getting these episodes last summer and then every week for the last 4 weeks.  I'm dragged out,, have lost more weight and not sure what to do. My stomach constantly gurgles and churns.  Sometimes I'm starving but then when I eat I can't hold my normal amount.  Doc gave me pills for excessive stomach acid a few months ago. I'm taking them,, but the weekly flu like symptoms have me worried. I've read up on my symptoms and it says things like Irritable bowel syndrome,, chrones,, etc.  I had a cat scan before the rads and doc never mentioned my stomach.  In fact I asked her and she said it was ok.  Could they have missed something?  Like pancreas (cancer) or some other organ causing too much bile.  I know gall bladder trouble is possible but no one has checked it. I'll talk to the oncologist Tuesday when I go back again for my faslodex injection. Then Wednesday for the bone building IV.   My hats off you all.  I hate practically living at the hospital.  I don't know how you all do it and keep your chins up for dummies like myself with all these problems. thanks so much.. P.S.  On Friday when I was sooo sick with severe cramps etc,,, my purebred ragdoll cat decided to have her kittens.  Felt like I had every contraction right along with her. What a day it was.  But,, she had 5 beautiful kittens. The beauty and miracle of life out weighs all my worry this week. :) Lynn",

I had surgery, Reconstruction at the same time,, Chemo and the Rads.  I had to deal with 4 doctors.  Surgeon, Plastic Surgeon, Oncologist and Rad Onc. The Surgeon was from the pits of hell I think.  She had a cold stone face when she first met me. Hadn't even looked at my pathology yet so had to go and read then come back.  Gave me the grim news that it was \"Bad\".  Had gone to 13 lymph nodes,, both breasts involved, used words like agressive etc. There was not one word of hope.  I beleive hope is something we need and can't live without. Needless to say she operated and after my follow up I never returned to see her. My plastic surgeon was up beat,, and every obsticle we came across we worked together to make it work. Because the general surgeon knew I'd need rads,, she said the plastic surgeon would not likely continue with the expanders.  I was so let down but when I went to see the plastic surgeon he said,, we were going to try it anyway. What was the point in stopping.  He never let me give up, When I had radiation they told me the expanders had to come out due to the metal ports for filling.  I came up with an idea to remove and install different ones with a port that would rest down below my bra line on my side rib cage out of the field of radiation.  My ps agree'd it was doable,, and i was the first to have implants filled after rads and it worked. My rad oncologist was also more up beat and gave me the stats and if the cancer came back they would have new treatments and not to worry too much etc.  I liked her and enjoy seeing her each time I need to. Now to my Oncologist.  She and her nurse were very supportive and upbeat for the 4 years I appeared to be cancer free. Always telling me I was doing amazingly well, as I was high risk for cancer coming back. The tone seemed to change when last year I complained of back and rib pain and after scans they told me the cancer had come back.  They both sat there,,,, as if a new attitude had over come them. Telling me this was not going to go away,,, chemo forever,, etc,, etc, I was already devastated by the news being so bad,,, I don't think hearing the additional challenges with chemo was going to make me stronger. I became resentful of their new found vision of my case and wondered what happened to the happy friendly staff I had once known. Since then I've dealt with the news and i;m on chemo again,, and trying to cope but if it wasn't for my Family Doctor who I haven't mentioned yet.... I don't think I could have dealt and likely would have taken my own life. My family doctor spends an hour or more at each visit.  He goes over the treatment I'm getting and tells me if he approves or not.  His staff called me a few weeks ago at home to see how I was doing since the chemo hit so hard.  They told me he'd come to my home to viist.  I told them I'd drive in as I wasn't bed ridden yet.  I went in last week and he let me know he was on the pallative team in my area and he would make home visits if I needed it down the road,, and he explained that pain management was his main concern. We discussed depression issues and I asked for some medication which he gave me.  After I left I felt like a weight had been lifted and I was no longer in this thing alone with my medical team.  When things get ugly I know he'll be there for me. ",

I went home after,, just got in the door and ran to the sink to throw up. Continued like that for several hours every 5 min of dry heaves. My stomach was already beat up from the night before.  I was a mess.  I had to go to work the next morning and heroically did 1/2 a day,, then came home and called the nurse. She appologized and they gave me some anit nausea drugs for that nights rad session.  It seemed to work.  I've got three more to go.  This is all for pain that I wasn't having too much of but thought Id get the radiation to help things out.  I feel like a mess lately.  I feel worse than when they told me this had spread.  Flare up pain today as well. Went to look at the new house and I felt like an invalid. My husband said he doesn't care if I'm only a head and nothing else. lol that he loves me for whats inside.

Not too sure that could be causing my stomach issue too.   Reflux,, feel full fast.  Anyone else have these issues?? thanks for listening Lynn Lynn Dx 2/9/2005, ILC, 6cm+, Stage IV, Grade 3, 13/29 nodes, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

No diharea right now.  Before rads I was getting once per week severe cramps and diharea,, so I'm glad its only cramps right now but its very exhausting. I seem to have alot of flatulence too. I saw a temp oncologist last week since mine was on holidays. He says to wait until I have another attack then go to emergency.  Says this isn't likely cancer since its rare it goes there and that I need a upper GI doctor.  I've made an appointment with my family doctor for Wednesday.  I will ask for a scope of my stomach. Thats all I can do I guess, I've lost 5 lbs in a month and its really worrying me. Thanks for listening to my whining. I just want to get better and worried its more serious. I'm also sleeping all the time. huggs Lynn",

Took about 2.5 hours to get it in.  I took the I.V. out myself. Had the faslodex too today. My bumb is sore.  I'm not sure which one makes me achey and tired but I am. We talked to the oncologist in more detail today. My bone met seems to be in many vert up my lower back, and some areas of pelvis.. as well as one rib.  Because its extensive,, this is why they kinda hoped I'd opt for Taxotere first.  But we have agreed to give the Faslodex 3 months. They can't radiate my vertebrae either because its not one big tumour.  Its spread out.  Guess when pain time comes,, I'm outta luck for that area. I see the rad oncologyst on Friday morning. I guess I\"m down in the dumps today more than normal.  I can't get this thing out of my head that I won't last very long.  You women are miracles you really are.  My red blood count is only 94 right now and is suppose to be around 120 so nurse said to eat some steak... lol  Isn't read meat bad for us?  I'm taking B12 on my own advice and will look up other things as well. I think I'd feel better mentally if I could find some energy.  Its  a vicous circle as I could be tired because im so stressed mentally. lol  Anyway,, I also asked about the biopsy.  She said because of my high risk for my bc spreading (many lymph nodes affected) and the scans etc they are certain its the same bc.  7% chance of the ER PR and herceptin changing. As well she is concerned about more issues trying to get some tissue in the areas,, than the status having changed.  Not sure why.  I didn't know it was in my pelvis too so that scares me even more.  My husband and I were trying to buy our dream home.  He wants to contine with it because he won't give up on me.  He wants me to quit work in Dec and start painting again.  So do I.  But I feel like I'm giving up normal life if I do that. No more work. Just disability.  I'm so confused.  I feel my body has let him down too. Sorry to be so depressed.  Must be the hormone needle. :(( Thanks for listening. big hugs :))) lynn",

The problem all this time was trying to distinguish side effects from various treatments and drugs with what could possibly be a  metastesis.??    I had joint aches,, back discomfort, fatigue,  I tended to beleive it was from being estrogen free. I had my ovaries removed on top of everything else when first diagnosed.  My oncologist also would swing in the direction that the aches and pains were from Arimidex,, or side effects of chemo years ago.  I went on my merry way.  4 months ago I decided to push for a bone scan or some sort of test since they did very little to me in all these years and my aches and pains had continued all last summer.  Well to make along story short the cancer had spread to my spine and pelvis as well as one rib.  I truely beleive that all the pain and problems I was having were from this and not from any side effect of a treatment.  Whats frustrating is that .. we aren't doctors.  We don't know whats the norm and what isn't and we rely on them to hear the alarms we might be sounding.  If I had to do it over again, I'd be making them re scan and re test me every time I feld something out of the norm.  Not that it would have changed my prognosis but they could have started their new treatments sooner and I would have avoided some of the discomfort I did have for so long. We shouldn't run to the doctor every time theres a pinch or an issue, ,but the rule of thumb is let it go for two weeks and if it doesn't get better,, then go to the doc and push for an investigation. Huggs and good luck to all of you ladies Lynn",

I can't feel a lump or anything hard and when I lay down it seems to disapear.  I read up on it and it sounds like a hernia possibly from being constipated from each Taxotere session.  I'm going to ask my family doc in a few weeks.  My first fear was cancer but its not in a location where it could cling onto. I have bone met and wondred if that was causing it, but theres no hardness of any kind. I've pushed and poked, and all it feels like is fatty tissue.   Has anyone had something like this. Its on the right side and I read that the bowel can prodrude in that area from straining.  hmmmm Lynn Lynn Dx 2/9/2005, ILC, 6cm+, Stage IV, Grade 3, 13/29 nodes, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
