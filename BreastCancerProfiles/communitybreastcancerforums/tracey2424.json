Its called Eribulin and im due to start next tuesday this is an IV in the arm on Day 1 and Day 8 then two wks offand so on. Apparently this drug is due for release early 2010.

Onc wants me to go on a new clinical trial to start March 10th thought that was maybe a good sign that he didnt put me staright back onto Chemo at my last visit. He has said i can either go back on Xelodia that was my last chemo (which made the liver mets shrink) and was just kept on Herceptin or start the new trial. Not much info on the trial as yet but from what i can gather its Phase 111 and is a chemo similar to Xelodia. I did really well on Xelodia with hardly any side effects so im very temted to enter the trial, its just lifting myself in the meantime as five weeeks seems an awful long time to wait im inpatient to get started. Everyone i seem to  tell that onc has suggested a new clinical trial seem to sound excited even his receptionist, should i be? If i dont get on with the trial i can always go back to Xelodia the choice is mine, whereas if i go back to Xelodia now i cant go on the trial at a later date. (treatments so far (A/C, Taxotere, Xelodia) i guess to some people im only at the beginning of my treatments.  Thanks for listening ladies feel better already what would we do without this board!!!

SO my onc gave me the Heceptin today probably the last one and wants me to enter into a Phase 3 trial has starts opens on 28th February. Its the E7389 Esai (Embrace study) to enter this you have to have failed on Herceptin, or he has given me the choice of going back onto Xelodia which i tolerated very well. so its decision time hes not in any rush he said i need to have been off Treatment for 5 wks to enter the trial, and to think about it. Dont think theres any hair loss so thats a good thing. Im trying my hardest to stay upbeat today obviously im dissapointed at the Herceptin failure and really dont know what to do!!! Has anyone heard off this trial that could give me some insight into it. Love Tracey.  Log in to post a reply",
