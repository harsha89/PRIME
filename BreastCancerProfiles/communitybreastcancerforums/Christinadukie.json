I have what is thought to be a fibroadenoma. 1 cm. Also a complicated cyst,( doesn't concern me as much, I have fibrocystic breasts. Can anyone who is been through the watchful waiting schedule of every six month rescans tell me a positive personal story of getting to the other side?.. Anyone get there without eventual biopsy, due to suspicious changes?. Trying to build a positive mental loop. Thanks ;) Log in to post a reply",

I get regular breast mammograms and this year asked to add ultrasound as well. My mammogram came back negative for cancer. My ultrasound showed 2, \" probably benign lesions\".. In my left breast, simple cysts in my right breast. The birads three lesions are considered most likely to be a benign fibroadenoma, very small and a slightly complicated cyst... My concern is, with my family history,( known to both my surgeon and my radiologist), can I even afford to wait six months, for the followup ultrasound...Scared... The reccomendations at this time is watchful waiting. Log in to post a reply",
