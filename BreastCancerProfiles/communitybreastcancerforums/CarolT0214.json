As long as it comes in....I don't really care what color...I can always fix it!  I saw a nutritionist last week and the only suggestion she gave me was to use a dandruff shampoo with Zinc, so I am trying that now.  Has anyone every heard of a supplement called \"Horsetail\"....the nutritionist is supposed to get back to me on that one....but it is supposed to promote hair growth. Everyone's pictures look great and give me hope that someday I will be able to leave the hats behind and uncover my head.  I never did the wig thing....not really sure why, but at this point I don't think I will bother.  Losing my eyelashes and eyebrows was the worst for me....I would never leave my house without mascara and eyebrow sealer before all this, now I don't have any choice.   I am looking forward to the day I have a reason to see my hairstylist!",
