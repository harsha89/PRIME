      "Content": "juliamiller wrote: I had my MRI today, and the radiologist says I have an \"indeterminate lesion\" so I am scheduled 11/9 for a stereotactic biopsy. Is that too long to wait? I really like the center where it would be done. Also, let's say the biopsy comes back positive. What then? That is, I know it would vary depending on what is found, but what I mean is, if a stereotactic biopsy comes back positive do you then have to have an excision biopsy, or do they go right to treatment? Also, I'm just curious -- they claim that the stereotactic biopsy is not painful, is that true? I don't know *why* I'm being such a baby, I'm usually much tougher than this but I feel so fragile right now.  Thanks for sharing your knowledge with me. Julia  Log in to post a reply",

I say it often these days, but I am so thankful for the internet -- it's so wonderful to be able to connect to others in this way. Of course it wouldn't be much without people like you, who come here to offer support and information. Thank you so much for helping people like me who are scared and worried. I hope someday I can help answer questions for folks in this situation. Oh, btw, I did get an earlier appointment for 11/5. Every little bit helps when you are in this position.",

Yet on all the many mammograms, and on the MRI, there is clearly a mass. Stranger than strange, huh? Relief over here. Wishing the best for all of you waiting on results. ",
