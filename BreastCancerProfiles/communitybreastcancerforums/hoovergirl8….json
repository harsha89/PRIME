I need to find out what all these abbrevations stand for!  I try to never use them, but it is nice to figure out what they all mean!!",

I just had my 5th of 6 taxotere treatments yesterday.  I feel like my hair is starting to grow back.  However, I am told I will continue to be having chemotherapy. My question is, for those of us who continue on chemo, will our hair grow back?  Should I invest in Minoxidil?  I take Biotin when I think of it.   I want my hair back! Thanks!",
