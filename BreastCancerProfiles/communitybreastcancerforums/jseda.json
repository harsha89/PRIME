I've had it done twice and re-done from every which angle and its not a big deal. You want them to mark your cancer correctly so highely recommend being more concerned that the accuracy be your primary concern. You will be fine. Once the anesthetic wears off, prior to your surgery, you may feel a little pressure but nothing you can't stand or need to take any med for. Good luck!! J.Seda",
