He has RA and just lost his kidney so he is super sensitive. We've been together since 1969. I have read a lot in this forum and it has actually calmed me. I was in panic mode when I found the first one and the second, which is hard is what made me call the doctor. Thank you again.",

Then another message 2 hours later stating and it is set for May10 at the hospital. I am just a bit put off by the length of time but at the same time this is a very small town in WV and the PA did not seem too concerned. They appeared literately overnight. Even though it's probably nothing.. They are 'my lumps'. Waiting is like an itch that you can't reach. I think I will go clean something. It snowed here yesterday and killed my flowers. Thank you again.",

I had an ultrasound today on my 'lumps' but I could not see the screen due to the way the table was turned. It was sort of uncomfortable due to the pressure I guess. I have a bruise from the other day on my rib from the machine. They then did a spot compressions mammo on something called microcalcifications and something called macrocaalcifications that I didn't know were there. One of the techs showed them to me-looked like little white dots. She said I had a dense nipple area in my left breast but not in my right one.? We're taking aa/a cup here! How in the world does a 66 year old person have dense nipple area in one breast and really what is that? I realize that means nothing at this point. But it is Friday so more waiting. I have decided that I am not really very good at that. I think hospital has to send everything away again. I didn't ask. I know this is necessary. I know they are just tests. I am going through nothing like you all are. And I really don't think much is wrong. Grizzly (husband) is driving me nuts. I don't know how to calm him. Plus, awoke to an inch of snow this morning. I am tired of winter. ~karen PS Wife/mom/teacher how yours go? PSS. You all have made this a lot easier. Thank you ",

      "Content": "framer wrote: Am 66 year old female. I found 2 lumps on my left breast and not overly concerned as I think they are just cysts or something like that. They just appeared. I went to a clinic today and the PA (mid-level dr) said \"he didn't think what he felt was bad stuff\", but wrote out a prescription for a MAMMO , diagnostic, digital, bilate. He called this invasive treatment. He also offered to do blood test -pap-smear and a bunch of othere tests that I didn't think were needed. I understand what that is and understand that he was a bit perturbed that I never had one. I have an aversion to doctors. Last doctor I saw was 10 years ago. The clinic gave me a portal. So I looked at it. There is only MAMMO , diagnostic, digital, bilate dated April 1 which is today. He told me to give it to 'them'. Stupidly I said ok and then left. Was I suppose to go somewhere? Was he going to make an appointment somewhere? Is it OK to ask this inside my portal? That's my question. I don't want to bother him. It was too late to call the clinic back. Would they think I am being pushy/stupid over this since both he and I do not think anything much is going on except two lumps that showed up out of nowhere. I feel very foolish.

I told the PA what I did in the portal and there was not any response. I don't think he likes me much. I will probably need to fire him. I have decided I didn't like his attitude. So she took 2 images of each breast, looked at her screen for awhile and then 4 more of the left breast where my lumps live. She said the images would be sent away because they don't have a doctor there. I found out the nearest breast place is 100 miles away. I would receive a letter in the mail or they would call me to come back in. I told her I knew she wasn't allowed to say anything.... She hesitated and said I would probably be called back in for an ultrasound. My breasts normally look like Slinky's with a glob of silly -putty on the ends. The machine bothered my ribs more than her trying to stretch them. I do not think stretching made a difference. They still look like slinky's. I wear an A cup so maybe is that's why and they want to make sure or it's nothing. I can't change the past. I have decided to stop worrying as the stress is too much to handle. So I wait again. It's OK because I am now a proactive person seeking information about my body and that is because of all of you. You have my deepest gratitude. It's a lot easier to be proactive for my husband. But my house is pretty clean now. It has snowed again. Thank you Karen ",

Reckon I am not going to drive much in the 'spring' either. ~karen PS. the other box didn't have any money in it.",

The care you showed for a complete stranger and for such a simple/stupid concern amazes me. Thank you. Everything came back ok (2 cysts) with a 6 month follow up for them and the microcalcifications.
