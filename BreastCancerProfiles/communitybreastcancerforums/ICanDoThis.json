For example, I had an early stage, low grade cancer,  and it turned out that I didn't have to have chemo. So my treatment was lumpectomy, partial breast radiation (only one week!), and tamoxifen.

You have gotten some good recs. Please be aware that chemo will definitely be recommended for your mother - it looks to me like chemo before surgery would likely have been a recommended treatment. Grade HER+ cancer is very aggressive, and is also the most likely to respond to chemo. I'm sorry, but that's the reality. And your Mom isn't old - heck, she's only 3 years older than me, and I AM NOT OLD! The main purpose of removing additional nodes would be to stage your mom, and look to see whether or not chemo is necessary, and since it looks like they already have that information, so maybe your mom can bypass additional dissection - recent studies are showing it to not be all that helpful. As for your onc not remembering stuff, they don't. Assume that they wouldn't recognize you on the street, to avoid getting your feelings hurt. There are exceptions out there, but it really doesn't have that much to do with the quality of the care their patients get.  I'm sorry - I know that this is all really scary, and I do wish your mom didn't have to do this. I think her desire for a PET and, possibly, other diagnostic tests is a good one. But this is a disease that can be fought to a standstill for long periods of time. My mother-in-law made a decision not be treated, but she was 86, and her grandaughter being so cute led her to trying hormonal treatments, extending her life fore several years. My daughter remembers her, and that's important. Good luck to you both",

Most of us do not need mastectomies - we have just been scared by the whole process, and all the talk that has surrounded \"For the cure\" over the last 10 years or so. A lumpectomy is a very small surgery - the smallest I've ever had. I was over quickly. I had a very good surgeon. He got really good margins. I had a few stitches, and two weeks later everything was healed. Because my tumor was under 2 cm, and my margins were good, I was able to have accelerated radiation, and was done in a few weeks. I ended up missing 7 days of work for treatment. And, I could have always gone back for a mastectomy, if I needed to. You can't put a healthy breast back on. Mastectomies are big surgeries. And you have drains, and painkillers, and miss tons of work. And then you have recon. Yuck! I am so incredibly lucky that I was able to have a lumpectomy -- a lumpectomy with sentinel node biopsy is what women were fighting for 20 years ago, when breast cancer meant that you went to sleep not knowing if you have cancer, and woke up maimed. Relax -- you have time to make this decision. Find out as much as you can, and trust your surgeon. They do this every week - they can give you good guidance.",

      "Content": "ICanDoThis wrote: This was published today in the Dr's Guide Media Review  Preoperative topical 4% liposomal lidocaine (LLC) significantly decreases the perception of pain during sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy injections, without any compromise in lymph node identification, investigators reported here at the 9th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBS 2008). SLN biopsy is an essential component of breast cancer staging and requires that radioactive tracer technetium 99 sulfur colloid be injected into the periareolar area. This process is known to cause pain and anxiety among patients, according to researcher Daniela J. Schupp, MD, Surgery Fellow, Inova Fairfax Hospital, Falls Church, Virginia. To determine the effect of LLC cream on pain and adverse effects, Dr. Schupp and colleagues performed a prospective, randomised, double-blinded study. They enrolled 42 patients aged 18 years or more who presented to the outpatient surgery centre and were not breastfeeding, had no lidocaine allergies, and had no prior periareolar surgeries. Patients received either placebo or 4% LLC cream to their areola with a 1-cm margin prior to SLN injection. The study's endpoint was perceived differences in anxiety and pain due to SLN injections as evaluated before the creams were applied and then within minutes after the injections as measured with a 2- to 10-point visual analogue scale. The researchers analysed the data using Wilcoxon rank tests. Caucasian women comprised the majority of patients (88%), the average age was 55 years, and the average weight was 75.7 kg. None of the patients had signs of an allergic reaction to the creams. Participants received injections within a mean time of 32.2 minutes (SD, 12.2). The difference in pain perception among the 20 patients in the LLC group and the 22 patients in the placebo group was statistically significant (P = .052). The lidocaine group reported a 1-point increase in median pain score from baseline (P = .002), and the placebo group had a 4-point median increase from baseline (P < .001). \"Anxiety is not affected by placebo or lidocaine cream application,\" Dr. Schupp noted in a presentation on May 3. Levels of anxiety before and after the injections were the same in the 2 groups, and there was 100% lymph node identification in both groups (P = .5).

I didn't have wire excision - my surgeon was part of the Phase III trial for SNBs and he knew what he was doing, so he was comfortable skipping this - he just used the blue dye. I should add that this was not part of the Breast Center's offerings, but my husband and I could not figure out how to get our LD daughter to school while simultaneously getting me to the breast center (They won't operate unless there is someone affixed to the waiting room). All of our backup plans fell through - so he did the surgery outside the main hospital without wire excision. Looking back, I am very grateful.",

When I was diagnosed, I went to him for a second opinion, but decided to stay where I was for treatment. Big mistake. I was the first patient to try the protocol, they didn't know what they were doing and where bad at it.  If I had it to do over, I would have stayed with Beaumont. I should add, I had twice daily rads, it meant that I was out of work for a week, but I went back the following Monday, although I did sleep all weekend.  ",

But there are a bunch of things that evidently your doctor didn't tell you that you should know. 1. 80% of all lumps are benign on mammogram. Of the lumps that go on to biopsy, 80% of those lumps are benign. Those of us who are here are a very small, selective group 2. Breast cancer grows slowly. Waiting 2 months for treatment is not a big deal to docs, although it is to us! It took me 8 weeks to get diagnostic mammograms, 3 weeks to get a biopsy, and 6 weeks from there to get surgery. No one was worried except me. And I am almost 9 years out, and I'm fine 3. 8mm is a small lump. It is very unlikely to have spread, and that is the only way you can die of BC. Even if you have cancer, it is unlikely that waiting until January will cause you any harm If I had it to do over, my house would have been so much cleaner. Find something, anything that will get your mind off the lump. And, if you're like me, get your hand off it too. I am glad you will have health insurance soon. Be honest with your doc about your fears, and see if there is anything they can do to get you to cover expenses between now and January. Be gentle with yourself. Cancer, and the fear of cancer, is a bitch",

Are they thinking of changing treatment options after all the results are in, or does your onc think that you are stable right now. Now, note that I am an interfering old woman, but are you comfortable with the treatment plan as laid out, or are you interested in getting a second opinion? If it were me, I would be looking at asking as many really high-class docs what they think. You are young, and have a good long life ahead of you. I also wanted to let you know, if you don't already, about youngsurvival.org . There are a lot of very young women there who are also dealing with triple negative cancer. There is a lot of discussion about the types of issues you are dealing with now. I worry about you, and send messages upstairs on a regular basis.",

However, I would like to share a couple of things you may want to think about - my MIL made this decision and did not share it with her husband of over 50 years, or with her son. Both were devastated when my FIL discovered the lump by accident one morning. He actually had to be hospitalized for heart problems - he was stunned. My husband was very angry with her - he felt excluded and unloved. When my daughter was born (only grandchild), her doctor suggested that she try a hormonal. She tolerated tamoxifen very well, and got three good high-quality years with very few side effects. My daughter remembers her, and I am grateful. Tamox is just a daily pill, and for me, I get it through a drug store program for about $100.00 per year. I did ask her if there was anything she would have done differently - she said that she would have had a simple mastectomy, as the wound management at the end when the cancer broke through the skin was very hard, and she hated the smell and the pain  a lot. I wish you years of happiness with your loved ones, and am so sorry that you have to deal with this. I hope these memories help.",

      "Content": "Apr 23, 2014 02:30PM ICanDoThis wrote: I am 6 years out now, and I am beginning to hate Komen \"For the Cure.\" WAY TOO MANY WOMEN ARE JUST TOO SCARED Do you know how hard surgeons worked to test out what was necessary, and what wasn't necessary to prevent cancer from coming back? There were hundreds of surgeon-years put into tests and studies, and, what they came up with is: A bilateral mastectomy is way overkill for 0.4 cm DCIS, especially if you are post-menopausal, and if the tumor is low to medium grade. I suspect that your surgeon already told you this, but there is absolutely no difference in length of life after BC if you have a lumpectomy or a mastectomy. Let alone a bilateral mast. But your quality of life after treatment is so much greater when you have a lumpectomy. There is a wonderful sheet for decision-making done by our Beesie, that summarizes the whole thing. Now then, as for fear, I had exactly the same reaction you did. But, my surgeon was one of those guys who spent lots of hours trying to cut down the awful results of unneeded mastectomies, and he talked me into a deal: Basically, we gave it a year, and if I was still terrified we would go back and take the boobs off. But, he really did not want me to maim myself unnecessarily. And I didn't. And 6.5 years later, I am still NED, and I am not scared anymore. And I love not having to go thru what I see my friends who had mastectomies go thru - infections, and leaks, and replacements, and really ugly chests. One woman I know had a flap replacement (with a tummy tuck thrown in for good measure), and is still have surgeries 8 yrs later (over 20 so far) to try to keep her organs from falling out of her stomach. Rare? Yes. Horrible? You bet. But she really had to have a bilateral mastectomy. You -- based on your diagnosis so far, don't. Please, oh please, read this, and see how you feel: The BeesieRMlulu is referring to is one of our resident experts. I am copying overBeesie's great post about things to consider when making this difficultdecision: \"Some timeago I put together a list of considerations for someone who was making thesurgical choice between a lumpectomy, mastectomy and bilateral mastectomy. I'veposted this many times now and have continued to refine it and add to it,thanks to great input from many others. Some women have gone through the listand decided to have a lumpectomy, others have chosen a single mastectomy andothers have opted for a bilateral mastectomy. So the purpose is simply to helpwomen figure out what's right for them - both in the short term but moreimportantly, over the long term. Before gettingto that list, here is some research that compares long-term recurrence andsurvival results. What the research has consistently shown is that long-termsurvival is the same regardless of the type of surgery one has. This is largelybecause it's not the breast cancer in the breast that affects survival, butit's the breast cancer that's left the breast that is the concern. The risk isthat some BC might have moved beyond the breast prior to surgery. So the typeof surgery one has, whether it's a lumpectomy or a MX or a BMX, doesn't affectsurvival rates. Here are a few studies that compare the different surgicalapproaches: No Survival Benefit For Mastectomy Over Lumpectomy Twenty-Year Follow-up of a Randomized Trial Comparing TotalMastectomy, Lumpectomy, and Lumpectomy plus Irradiation for the Treatment ofInvasive Breast Cancer Twenty-Year Follow-up of a Randomized Study Comparing Breast-ConservingSurgery with Radical Mastectomy for Early Breast Cancer Now, on to mylist of the considerations: I hope thatthis helps. And remember.... this is your decision. How someone else feelsabout it and the experience that someone else had might be very different thanhow you will feel about it and the experience that you will have. So try tofigure out what's best for you, or at least, the option that you think you canlive with most easily, given all the risks associated with all of the options.Good luck with your decision!\" ",

They help prevent local recurrence, but also help prevent distant metastasis, like to the bone or liver. I also have terrible bone density, and am post-menopausal, but am taking tamoxifen to prevent recurrence, and to strengthen my bones. The only positive side effect I've had from this is that I don't have to take Fosamax anymore, tamoxifen is a bone strengthener. Good luck - I hope everything works out for you",

Your diagnosis looks a lot like mine did at your stage. My tumor was a little larger than yours (1.5 cm), but it was also grade 1. They did an ultrasound of my lymph nodes before surgery, and it came back negative. My first response was CUT IT OFF - but the recommendation was, we can always take it off if we find problems, but let's start with a lumpectomy - just getting in and seeing what's going on in there. When I had my lumpectomy, they found very little DCIS around the main IDC, and everything was tightly clustered together. My surgeon got great margins. He did a sentinal node biopsy (SNB), and the nodes all came back clear. I was back to work in 2 days, although I worked from home that first day. Treatment: Partial breast irradiation (5 days, 10 treatments, no burns), no chemo - so I didn't lose my hair, tamoxifen. 4 months after I found the lump, my treatment was complete.  If I had it to do over, I would have pushed harder for an oncotype, but I was the only one who was even interested in that. I went for a second opinion on both the no chemo and the partial breast irradiation, and both confirmed what I was told. So yeah, where you are is like the first gate of Hell, but some of us, especially those of us with small, lazy tumors, get a quick pass through Purgatory, and then right back out the doors. The main thing I would recommend is that you find a breast surgeon or specialist who suits your style. Most of my issues were with a system that was sure that whatever I said was not worth listening to, not with the quality of my doctors. Good luck, and try not to be too frightened.",

Having a post-menopausal parent with a history of BC (especially one who took hormone replacement therapy) does NOT make you high risk. When I was diagnosed, I had a long talk with my onc, since my brother had also had prostate cancer, and my MIL died of BC (at 80). My daughter is at normal risk. And so is this woman. Would we have spent $100,000 on a woman with normal risk if she weren't a breast surgeon -- don't forget that Tricare is our tax dollars, ladies.

My first reaction was exactly like yours - just cut the damned things off! I ended up having a lumpectomy. You might want to consider these factors. 1. LCIS and ILS are usually very unaggressive cancers. So you are less likely to have recurrence than those of us who had IDC. 2. The latest statistics show that the 5 year outcome for mastectomy and lumpectomy + radiation is EXACTLY the same. That means that you get no added benefit for all your added pain. I was back to work in 2 days, and swimming within a few weeks. 3. Reconstruction is not a given. There is the possibility of serious complications, and many women are really dissatisfied with the results. I personally know one woman who is on her 11th corrective surgery. She swears she will live with whatever the outcome is. I strongly recommend that you talk to several PS's before you decide who you want to do your surgery. One option you might want to consider is to see how a lumpectomy goes - you can always go back and get everything done if you still feel the same way. This is what I did. My pathology results were really good - my margins - the edges around the tumor that they cut out - were almost as big as the tumor, and I had no lymph node involvement. All my doctors told me that with my results, anything beyound lumpectomy was way overkill. Once I had that hideous thing out of my body, and thought about it for a while, I decided that I would believe them. For what it's worth.",

Docs look at a combination of your age, the size of the tumor, the status of your nodes, whether or not you are hormone positive, whether or not your tumor is HER +, etc. Here is a link to the information pages from bc.org that will give you an overview of this: http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/types/idc/ The most recent technology is the oncotype test, which is likely to be what your first oncologist wants to do - it tests the activity of the tumor cells. I am post-menopausal, my tumor was very low grade, had wide margins, no nodes and I was very ER/PR positive. My oncologist recommended against chemo without doing an oncotype test - said that the chem was more dangerous than the cancer. Got a second opinion, and was told the same thing.

I walked into the dept, and two ladies were discussing how to improve the scheduling system so they could see more people, etc. I was waiting for a break in the conversation, and they were chatting, so I chimed in with how important it was to make more slots open - evidencing my own case. The woman I was speaking with (who turned out to be the head of scheduling for the entire hospital), asked me if I would have tolerated a 7-week delay if it had been my child - she asked how hard I had pushed. She suggested that I could have called every morning to ask if there had been any cancellations, or that I could have asked to speak to a more senior person. That persistence was the key. I didn't push, because, even though I knew in my heart I had cancer, I hadn't been diagnosed yet, and everybody else was as important as me. Well, I was lucky - I had a low grade, small tumor, but those 7 weeks could have been really important. It also didn't occur to me to try the tricks she suggested, and I don't think it's fair that we have to weep all over some clerk to let people know how concerned we are, but you might want to consider the calling and checking for cancellation thing.

But I'm one of those people with serious respiratory issues (I'm one of those asthmatics who lands in hospital having steroids pumped into my system). Right now, H1N1 is just being issued through health departments along critical pathways. But we had to scrape the bottom of the barrel (well, those little glass vials) to get the regular flu shot - she's expecting another shipment next week. They cut back regular flu shot production to produce more H1N1 - guess we should have all gotten them at Walgreen's last month, but I didn't know! My DH, who is just finishing treatment for EC - his oncologist doesn't have a supply of vaccine, but patients in treatment are fairly high on the list.",

      "Content": "Aug 19, 2011 09:21AM - edited Aug 19, 2011 09:22AM by ICanDoThis I had this treatment, as I got a severe infection trying for Mammosite. I believe that women who meet certain criteria - I had a tumor under 2 cm, with wide clear margins, and no other signs of issues elsewhere in the breast, should seriously consider this treatment. I went early in the day, and then at the end. It is a longer treatment than most people describe, with several position changes. You may want to ask for a blanket or some other covering, as I got COLD. It's okay to ask for warmth - I don't know if shivering can affect the field. I know that it wasn't what my techs were used to doing, and they weren't real good at moving me, but we worked it out. I barely got a sunburn - tan faded in a few months, and I get rave reviews on the quality of my skin - many docs are like, are you sure you had rads - tattoos convince 'em. My main side effect was fatigue. I've written about it before. The first few days, I exercised and met friends between treatments, and led a normal life, by the middle, I cut out exercise, and after the last treatment I went home and slept for 2 days. I made it to work on Monday, but if I had any sense, I would have taken a few more days off. Within  a few months, I was totally back to normal. Hope this helps. If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask Sue",

I agree with your doc that sestamibi scans are not always really accurate. My scan showed 1 parathyroid with problems; I actually had 3. I didn't go to Florida, I went to a large university system with a website that specified that they specialized in minimally invasive surgery. My surgeon did about 5 surgeries per week, and even with 3 problem parathyroids, my scar is only about 2 inches long. And after 2 yrs, it is largely faded. Do ask to make sure that your surgeon checks for multiple problems. It was an outpatient surgery, although if you had problems, you may end up staying overnight. I was there about 20 hrs, but went home to sleep in my own bed (Oh, bliss). And when I woke up, my bones already ached a little less. And they have gotten better steadily. The other side effect it has had a good effect on is fatigue and depression, because I had a terrible time with D levels, and this helps fix it. I felt emotionally much better within a week. It is wonderful to have something that surgery just FIXES. There is nothing needed after surgery, although mine was diagnosed as an aftereffect of osteoporosis, so I am on Prolia. I take Vitamin D, because it tends to tank living up north as I do, and my doc asks me to be sure that I get 1200 mg of calcium (and he prefers that I get it thru food -- salmon, dark greens, yogurt, ice cream!-- although I do occasionally supplement). Hope this helps",

You have like 60 days to go back and sign up, and it will still be considered continuous care (critical for a case like your SIL's). The government is picking up 2/3s of the cost of this health insurance until the end of the year. No matter what, they must beg, borrow, or steal the money to pay for that coverage. It shouldn't be that much - for my family, it was about $460 a month. After that, the hospital where your SIL is a patient should have a social worker whose job it is to help her figure out options.  Hope this helps, good luck with this ",

My husband says that it was plenty of cancer for us, thanks. We still had to wait for the mammogram, go through the biopsy and lumpectomy or mastectomy, wait for path results. I only missed 2 days of work for surgery, and, if I hadn't gotten an infection, that would have been my only time off work. Dr Love's Breast Book talks about a failed study where Grade 1 women were randomized for radiation vs no radiation - we still need it. That's really the only research I've seen on Grade 1's, any body have more information?  One thing that I think we should do, proactively is at least discuss mammosite or other kinds of brachytherapy with radiation oncologists. But it was still a life-changing experience for me, and is, every night when I take my hormone pill. Wow - Anne, TWICE? Yuck. Sue",

My doctor says that the results are equivalent to mammosite, but it just doesn't have the advertising behind it. Dr Viccini who wrote a lot of the papers on partial breast radiation is concentrating on this in his practice. From a patient point of view, I am actually very high on this treatment. You get a standard simulation, and the treatments are longer, because they do multiple views in each treatment (I had 6 irradiated views in each treatment). The techs were a little cranky, because they didn't like all the repositioning, and I was a little cranky because the 20 mins or so on the hard table was a little tough on my back, but we got through it. I had a friend who was going to have mammosite, but there wasn't enough room, so she had the external, and also found it to be very easy. I loved being done in 5 days. I didn't work through treatment - with 2 treatments a day, and all the travel and going out to exercise and then get lunch, my days were full. I was a little pink by the end, and was told that I would get redder, but I didn't. I was tan in a couple of weeks, and now I'm back to normal pasty white. I was seriously fatigued - I went to bed Friday night, and barely got up til Sunday, but I went back to work full-time on Monday. - I have better skin than anyone else I've heard of, and my rad onc says I have the best nipple he's ever seen (What a thing to be excited about!)

There are very few BC tumors that change significantly in a few days - hard as waiting is (and I waited 7 weeks for a mammo - don't find a lump in October), it really won't make a difference in what they find. In the meantime, breathe, and find something constructive to do - personally, I cleaned and repapered all my kitchen cabinets, sorted our prescription bottles, refiled all our family paperwork, sorted the family albums and started a scanning project, well, you get the picture.

I have learned so much from these women. If you weren't freaked out, I don't think you'd be human. This is like being thrown into a whole new world that I, for one, would have been perfectly happy to have never visited. But, it's kind of cool that if you take it one step at a time, it is all very managable, although quite stressful. I'm another Friend of Bills. My home group has been a godsend to me - there are women who remember me from before dd was born (she's 18), so they know that even though I whine and complain, I can do whatever is put in front of me. It also helps to be married to someone in recovery. He managed the pain meds after surgery for me. Unlike Debbie, I've discovered that I don't have any tolerance for mood altering chemicals - all these years of asking God to just keep me not drunk today seems to have resulted in a really effective mental block. I look at it this way: my reaction to pre-op sedation sure let me know that I don't want to try a drink for another 20 yrs or so!  If you need more support, please drop me a private message as well. If new sisters in sobriety keep showing up, maybe we should schedule an online meeting! May your HP take really good care of you, especially since it's your birthday. Sue",

I also wanted mammosite - and was approved for it. I was stage 1, grade 1, and had waited far too long to get my mammogram (never find a lump in October) so needed rads to be OVER.  Or else, they were going to lock me up. Had heard about brachytherapy from a cousin-in-law (DH has 32 first cousins) who had this treatment in New Orleans. She's 10 years out and doing just fine. So I pushed, and they agreed, and inserted catheter, and I went for my first treatment. It's not wonderful, but the treatment is only a few minutes long, and they do an x-ray each time to make sure the catheter has not moved. However, they didn't put me on an antibiotic, and ended up with a messy infection, and they had to remove the catheter. There is another balloon device called Concentra, that is oval, so it may work better for you. There is another partial breast option - I had it - it is the other arm of the Mammosite trial - 2wce a day treatments for 5 days. They do multiple views, so it's longer on the table, and there are position changes, but boosts and everything are included. I am so glad I had this treatment, and would do it again in a heartbeat. My skin had no trouble at all - just a sunburn, and I healed within a week. My onc said I had the best results he had ever seen. I know some other women who have had the Canadian protocol - 15 days, and out. If any of these options seem good to you, I think I can find more information - just don't remember every detail now.

In fact, it is the treatment that I had. It works for almost all women who share our diagnosis. If your wife is post-menopausal, you may wish to look into short time radiation protocols, like Mammosite or the Canadian protocol, before she has surgery, but otherwise, this is a very standard treatment protocol that works very well. I would suggest that you spend some time reading the treatment pages here at BC.org so that you can better understand what the treatment will involve. One thing that you probably don't know, that would have helped me a lot, is that, with a low-grade tumor, you have time to come to understand what these treatments involve. Low-grade tumors have been lurking, at a small size, for a long time, and a few extra weeks to feel comfortable with treatment is not a problem. If you really like the surgeon, and don't think you need an additional opinion, you might want to consider calling the surgeon's office, and asking if they have a nurse-navigator or someone else, who can spend a good chunk of time with you, explaining the details and answering questions.

Of course, our docs always worry when young women get breast cancer, but you are likely going to be just fine. I think it's important that you see a specialist in BC in young women -- your needs may be different from an old lady grade 1 like me. But, I do know several young women with the same diagnosis that I have -- which is the same diagnosis you have, so far, by the way, and they are all still fine 7 years out.

My oncology nurse told me that this would be the worst year of my life, and your year is only just about over. It's only now that things should start getting better. You might want to consider doing things that are kind to you. Bubble baths - maybe a massage, if the budget will stretch. I'm finding that increasing my exercise seems to be having a positive effect on my moods. I see a therapist - she is teaching me to replace negative thoughts with positive ones. Remember that we are not responsible for the first thought that pops into our heads, but we are responsible for the follow-up ones! So, I try to notice when I'm frightened and negative, and to change the subject. I even have a little list next to my computer of things that make me happy and grateful, so I don't have to think positive - I just have to look for the positive that's right at hand.

The estimate is that this gave her two good years, and with a small grandchild, those years were precious. She had no side effects from this medication, which is a pill you take once a day (I take it now, and have no side effects) and it is now inexpensive.

But it was small, and we caught it in time, and the treatment was simple - My odds of 5 years -96 % And those are old statistics, based on treatments in the 1990s But most lumps in younger women are benign -- not all, but most. Just keep keeping on - try to make some time for yourself, and do things that you find relaxing. Time DOES pass, and you will have answers. And we'll be here for you Sue",

Yes. People who have had shingles can receive the shingles vaccine to help prevent future occurrences of the disease. This is true no matter when they first got shingles. Updated Oct 2008 This was very comforting information to me, because I got shingles right after treatment, and like, oh, my god, I never want to do this again. The shots are expensive to those of us not yet on Medicare ($200), but I was willing to pay it to avoid that misery again! I wouldn't be surprised if your mother-in-law couldn't get it completely covered.",
