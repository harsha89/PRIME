I had a repeat core needle biopsy for my growing / changing fibroadenoma. It came back as \u201cfindings consistent with a fibroadenoma\u201dso I\u2019m back to follow-up imaging in 6 months. At that time I may see if I can go ahead with a lumpectomy like you did. Hope you\u2019re doing well and recovering quickly post surgery. =)",
