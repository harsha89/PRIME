    "Content": "godsgotthis2013 wrote: I was just officially diagnosed this past Monday (the hints were pretty strong), when we received the biopsy report. Positive in the left breast 3.4cm plus satelite lesion, positive in the lymphnode under the arm, still unsure about the lymphnode under my clavical, as they were unable to access it during the biopsy. We meet with the surgeon and the oncologist specialist next Wed for a complete review of pathology report and discussion of game plan. That alone is daunting, but there is just so much \"other\" stuff! Preparing your own medical file, logging mileage to doctors-we are about 45 minutes from the cancer center, getting in touch with a social worker, financial prep (I work from home by doing in-home daycare so I can homeschool our youngest in 3rd grade), legal paperwork like POA's, making sure you ask your questions and what questions to ask, not to mention the things that we were already working on in our lives before the diagnosis-our daughter and her husband just had a baby, we have 2 teenage sons-one is a senior and one is a freshmen. And while I know God's got the cancer part and I'm pretty good at multi-tasking, wow-the legwork seems like a lot. And I'm really sad about the thought of starting treatment right before the holidays :( Anyone else feeling it? Dx 10/14/2013, IDC, 3cm, Stage IIB Log in to post a reply",
