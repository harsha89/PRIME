Prior to last summer, my entire dcis diagnosis/treatment in  2009 was relatively non eventful.  I had two surgeries (1st biopsy, 2nd lumpectomy), followed by 4 weeks radiation. I had a small infection due to stitch that didn't fall out(and I felt the need it touch constantly). All healed perfectly. I missed no work, except for day of, and I day after surgeries.  Continued regular work schedule and workout routine entire time including during radiation (spin class 3x's week).   I had existing implants (2004) at time of diagnosis.  I was told that implants don't always do well with radiation, but I honestly thought they meant that the one may weaken and I would replace.  I planned to go bigger anyway, so really didn't think it was a big deal.  I didn't ask specific enough questions, or just didn't know the questions to ask. It all went so fast and I had no problems at the time. Barely even burned. I have had thyroid cancer and a hysterectomy in past and bounced back very quickly with them also. Anyway, last summer I noticed my radiated breast began to shrink. It is not that stiff , just smaller.  Probably has been getting smaller the whole time, and just became noticeable. Did looses some volume from lumpectomy but was really noticeable until then. Now VERY Obvious in my summer clothes . I went to plastic surgeon to swap out implants and am now being advised not to do anything to the radiated breast and to reduce the non radiated side to even me out. Needless to say, I was speechless as  I wanted to go bigger. I had paid to make them larger in 2004.Appearantly, the implant is perfect, but the breast tissue is shrinking.    They said that is the norm with radiation. They also said that as I age, keeping symmetry will be a problem. They will do surgery to both if I want, but said that it is hard to heal radiated skin and that I could end up with nothing. The last option I had said, \"you won the lottery of how a breast can look after radiation...don't screw with it\"   I know this sounds horrible. I am alive and thankful for it. I am sorry for all the women who are fighting for their lives and are sick.  I never Even considered myself a \"survivor\" cause I was never really sick.   Has anyone had successful surgery to radiated breast?  Anyone a few years out from surgery/radiation with even breasts??
