I had a bilateral mastectomy last week - waiting for my final histo results. Was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma when I had the lump removed in May. I have received lots of info and timbits from reading all your posts - Thank you. Its a scarey time but it always helps to know that you are not the only one. Matlock from Canada",
