I just found this website and joined today in hopes to find answers to many of my questions, and was surprised to see your offer of the bras and prosthetics.  I happen to be the same size as your Mother, and would deeply appreciate them if they are still available.  I hope you see this post because I don't know how to email people individually as yet. God bless you for this offer. Take care, Karen",
