      "Content": "Jul 5, 2008 11:09AM - edited Jul 5, 2008 11:11AM by Curlylocks Hi Water,  I had an ooperectomy on May 26, am 44 was 41 when diagnosed with er/pr+ IDC, grade 3 and 3 positive lymph nodes.  I was pre-meno when diagnosed, had Zoladex injections for 1 1/2 years along with Armidex.  My oncologist brought up the oopherectomy six months almost a year after I first mentioned it.  I am happy that I no longer need the Zoladex injections (one less drug in my body) and for me the transition to surgical menopause has not been difficult as a result.   Yes I do have insonmia, hotflashes (although they seem to have gotten better 6 weeks out of the surgery) but dont have the swinging mood swings that I had on Zoladex and it has been easier to loose some weight since being off it too! I had a  9 working days off after surgery, was tired the first couple days back but the stamina slowly built up after about 3 weeks. My memory has gotten pretty poor since being shot into chemical menopause and now surgically, it gets very frustrating some days.  Like now I just realized that I have my laundry in the washer since last night....duh...gotta love those light bulb moments.LOL.  I do not regret my decision to eliminate those little \"estrogen demons\".... ",

      "Content": "Jun 16, 2008 04:39PM - edited Jun 16, 2008 04:39PM by Curlylocks Cupcake, I am 44 and am almost a 3 year survivor of Invasive Cancer that invaded outside the breast into 3 of my lymph nodes, also a Grade III which means it was aggressive and my tumour was 4 cm.  I was staged at IIb. Breast cancer is not the death sentence and many, many women are living long healthy lives after treatment. I know the feeling all too well of being \"hit by the 2 x 4\" and hearing those words you have cancer.  I remember it like it was yesterday....but today I am happy, healthy and cancer free. You will have an indication of the stage that you are once you have surgery and get your pathology report back, yes the waiting totally sucks and seems to take forever.  Its the hurry up and wait rollercoaster that you are about to embark on.... I had a lumpectomy with clear margins, 6 months of chemo, 5 1/2 weeks of radiation, recently an oopherectomy to remove my \"little estrogen demons\" and have been on hormonal drugs for 2 years.  Yes, this diagnosis is very tough emotionally but once you get a treatment plan into place things will feel a little more \"less out of your control\"..... Time does heal the emotional wounds and yes there is definitely tons of HOPE and lots of living left to do for you....keep your head held high and put on those boxing gloves to beat the crap out of this beast! The breast cancer terminology takes a little getting use to: bc = breast cancer idc = invasive ductual carcinoma snb = sential node biopsy dcis = ductual carcinoma institu  er/pr status = whether cancer was fueled by estrogen ---  + = yes, - = no Staging - indicated by Stage 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4. Your doctor should be able to tell you what type of cancer you have by the biopsy results.  Staging is not determined until after you have surgery and your lymph nodes are tested to see how many nodes may be affected, as well as a hormone receptor test (er/pr status) and her2 status, all of which  will help your medical team put a treatment plan into place.   Baseline scans are usually done when cancer has invaded outside of the breast.  I had a liver/abdomen scan, bone scan and chest xray and all turned out negative for spread.  Your doctor may wanting to get down to the business of getting rid of any active cancer cells prior to surgery.  Come back here often if you have any questions, alot of us have been in your shoes...

With starting chemo, you will need some extra help especially with the children and everyday household chores - making meals, etc.  My first 4-5 days of every treatment were the most challenging... All the best in your journey. Michele ",

I was diagnosed at age 41 with a highly positive er cancer, had 3 positive lymph nodes and a 4 cm tumour.  My oncologist wanted to be on the aggressive side of treatment for me due to the age.  I am on Armidex and Zoladex injections.  I will be getting my ovaries removed on May 26 so that I can remain on Armidex and stop the Zoladex injections. Studies are showing that AI's are a little more cutting edge as far as preventing reoccurance but are not without their side effects as most drugs  are.  An HER+ cancer would mean that the cancer is more aggressive but the good news is that there is a drug called Herceptin which is given over the course of a year via IV.  It is the new wonder drug and saving many lives!! All the best with your treatments. Sorry that this new language of breast cancer is so confusing.  You too will be an expert soon.... Your bc sister Michele ",

      "Content": "Jun 8, 2013 01:38AM - edited Jun 8, 2013 01:40AM by Curlylocks I so this post and wanted to respond as it is appropriate to my family.  I was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 41 (I just turned 49), my aunt had stage 0 diagnosed at age 60.  My youngest sister was diagnosed at age 42 in 2010 and passed away last year at age 44.  My older sister who is 50 may now have bc as well.  She went for her regular mamogram/ultra sound in January, got called back for more testing...her doctor recommended she have an MRI due to high risk first degree family history.  She went back for more testing and they said she had a few cysts.  In the meantime, she had to go to genetic counselling to get into the \"High Risk\" screening program which would get her the MRI.  She had the MRI on May 22 and got called back for further investigation.  Final tests incuding ultrasound confirmed she has a 1cm lump in her right breast and is awaiting a biopsy on June 17. My youngest sister who died was tested for the BRCA1 and 2 gene a few months before she died and it came back negative.  I have never been tested but will be going within the next year so that I can get into the High Risk screening program.  With two sisters and a possible third (first degree relatives) having bc there has to be a genetic link somewhere.  As other posters have said their are genes that may be genetic that have not been identified as of yet.  Nothing else makes sense. When you said you went for your Yearly Exams, was that a mamogram or Physical?  If you havent had a mamogram, I would ask your doctor to do one to find out what the lumps are.   Having hair growing around your breast does not sound like a symptom of breast cancer.   Its hard to say without having testing done if it is bc because everyone presents differently.  Some women have no visible lumps, some lumps are benign conditions, some women have pain others dont. Here in Canada they have criteria for doing genetic testing - you have to be diagnosed with bc and have three first degree family members.  Ie. sisters, mother.  I am not sure about aunts and cousins and the age that they are diagnosed is also taken into account.  In my case my aunt was not considered familly history as she was diagnosed in her 60's. All the best to you in finding out what the lumps are. Michele",

      "Content": "Dec 21, 2007 06:37PM - edited Dec 21, 2007 06:37PM by Curlylocks Hi Angie, I am sorry that you got the \"news\" that you have invasive cancer. I was diagnosed in Oct 05 at age 41 with invasive cancer, a 4 cm tumour and 3 positive lymph nodes out of the 23 removed.  I have to say that the beginning part of this journey is the hardest as you really dont know what you are dealing with until you do have surgery and the final pathlogy report is done.  The waiting and wondering is extremely hard and so unfair to all of us fighting this disease.... More than likely you dont have to worry that the cancer will spread before you have surgery.  Most cancers have been in our bodies for 6-8 years prior to discovery so a few weeks is not unreasonable to wait.  I had my surgery 3 weeks after diagnosis. Once you see the surgeon and have a treatment plan in place, you will feel like you have more control of this disease. Breast cancer is not a death sentence.  I am proof that you can come out the other side of this nasty disease and once again be a healthy person.  I seriously could not plan a day ahead into my future when first diagnosed but life has once again become happy and I am living a \"new normal\" beyond breast cancer. Come here often to ask any questions, voice your fears or just to vent as we understand having travelled the same journey that you are about to embark on. Big hugs to you tonight and the very best to you and your family during this holiday season. Your bc sister Michele ",

Yes moving is a big task and haven\u2019t even started yet, its all the stuff that precedes it\u2026   Mary \u2013 is there a delay in responding back and how do you keep track of all the conversation going on, can only one person type at a time\u2026OMG my head is hurting just thinking about it!   Rosemarie \u2013 we did enjoy our weekend.  We finally were able to have a bonfire as the fire restrictions had been lifted, dh and I had a competition to see who was the best \u201cmarshmellow roaster\u201d too funny\u2026..   Kelly \u2013 I wonder what impact Armidex actually has on your bones or is it being shot into menopause or a combination of both.  I have my gyn appt on Nov 20 and will get details as to when my ovaries will be removed.  I don\u2019t  want to have another surgery but also don\u2019t treasure the idea of being on Zoladex for years either due to my age and being er positive. It seems that treatment never ends with this disease\u2026.   Hands up, we are not brave\u2026we were forced to face this disease head on or curl up in a ball and melt away into nothing.  The choice for us was obvious\u2026.   Tracyseattle \u2013 welcome to Canada eh?  Hope you are enjoying your stay in Alberta, have never been out West maybe someday when we get older, ha ha\u2026we have the Caribbean bug now.   Cindy \u2013 you make me laugh\u2026.a new word disabuse.  How are you?   Maryanne \u2013 Talking about bc and pink I even saw pink ribbon air freshners for the car that smell like vanilla.   Brenda \u2013 OMG little Johnny is behaving rotten.  It sounds like your classroom keeps you hopping.LOL.   Debbie \u2013 another teacher with her hands full of little ones that make you go wonder how their parents cope with them at home.    Jacqui \u2013 you are a great support to your friend.   Amy \u2013 where are you little sister?    Have a super evening ladies.   Love Michele    ",

We are counting down to our move and our trip down south.  Will probably pack a few boxes tonight, progress is being made finally!   Maryanne \u2013 how did your run go?  Was the weather just as nice where you were?    Graycie \u2013 everyone keeps saying to me that I should be getting a little bit of an increase for taking over but they don\u2019t see it that way.  We all work as a team and one member is missing we pick up the slack and spread it around.LOL.  We get paid for the days that we call off sick, in Ontario we have 10 emergency leave days which include sick time.  We also have a percentage of our salaried paid for 15 weeks for short term disability and potentially up to age 65 for long term disability.  We are lucky and cant complain about our benefit plans in Canada!  Thanks for the info on the hot tub not sure I am happy with not being able to go in it, that sucks\u2026.  I haven\u2019t been home most of the weekend, stayed at mom\u2019s since yesterday afternoon due to the run today and having to get so early.     Deb \u2013 I don\u2019t know why those weird things show up in my paragraphs, it looks like I\u2019m burping or cusing or I don\u2019t know what, haa haaJ  We did have a fun weekend last weekend but dh is going to close up the trailer next weekend for the season\u2026. Hey sister get that mamo done, its important!!   Kelly \u2013 I get three weeks paid vacation, this year get four as had a week left over from when I was off on sick leave.  I work Monday \u2013 Friday 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 pm., no weekends.  Cute cartoon and so true, life is really different now but I cherish each day!    Laura \u2013 have you had a chance to come up for air yet?  Say hi to Shelby for me!  I hope Jan Claire is okay and gets an answer on her tummy issues.  How was the walk?    Jill \u2013 glad to hear that you are doing well.  Enjoy your trip!    Cathy \u2013 your welcome!  Amy \u2013 hope you are okay and just busy with the puppy!  We miss you\u2026..    Take care my sisters and have a wonderful Sunday evening.  Here is a picture from the run today with my radiation buddy Julie.   Love You all Michele    ",

Okay where are the pictures of our famous Ann Taylor models? I can see you putting the pedal to the medal on the old Goat.LOL.:)  I;m glad I wasnt in it either, haa haa... Deb - that sucks that your legs are in pain again.  Do you take advil for pain relief to get some sleep at night?  Glad to hear that you booked that dreaded mamo and ultrasound.  Mine is in February but they were not schedulling any appts when I went with my requisitions last month.  I have a gp's appt for my \"annual physical\" on Oct 15 so will book them then. I am ROFL now too, I didnt get Maryanne's post...OMG I am so DUH sometimes!  I wish that was the case unfortunately menopause has not been kind to me in that department.....but we do work at it....ha ha:)  The lady in the picture with me is my friend Julie who lives pretty local to me, met here in radiation last year.    Brenda - glad to hear that you dont have le.  Ha, ha your sense of humour is so funny, what did little Johnny do now that you want to hoist him up on the cabinet?  Maryanne - see its your turn now to have the energy and spunk to renovate, I am too pooped doing double duty at work to even think of packing tonight let alone putting in a floor.  I liked how you called it Michely mode.  I feel so special...hee hee:):) Woo hoo, you forgot about your 2 year anniversary, its a good sign that you are moving onward!  Kelly - thanks.  The CIBC Run for the Cure shirts have a different design each year.   This year's was a series of butterflies in the shape of a ribbon. TracyNY - you go girl, what a shopper! Have a great evening girls. Love you all! Michele ",

The nice sunny days are certainly going to be numbered here soon as the first day of Fall approaches on Tuesday. For those ladies on Armidex, do your feet hurt, mainly your toes hurt when you walk?  Mine toes have been bothering me along with my hips, tonight when I got out of the car hobbled into the house like an 80 year old! TracyNy - I know that Jamaica is your favourite island, ours too!  We are going to Negril, love the beaches there. Paula - love the beautiful pictures and one of the kangaroo too!   Glad to hear that you are well again! Debbie - what is napalm?  Hope things get better soon.  Maryanne - yes I will be doing the run for the cure on the 30th.  I have never had any stomach surgery and yes it is going to be done laproscopyly.  My appt with the gyn is on Nov 20th, hoping to book it for early next year. I know we have seven weeks left but we are going to be going away from Oct 20-30 so it puts a  little pressure on us to most things packed before we go away. I would be stunned if someone asked me if I was so and so from bc.org!  Laura - that is cute that Shelby wants the same outfit as you, she really looks up to you!  The calendar is a \"family calendar\", this is the first year that our town has done something like this, so a few of the guys are showing some muscles with sleevless shirts but most are in their uniforms but still hunky.  My dh is in October 07 with a group of other guys sitting on the firetruck.  I am going to take the picture when October is finished and frame it for our living room! Graycie - will have to check out the local drug stores to see if I can find the magazine. Have a great Sunday evening ladies, tomorrow is MONDAY, yuk!! Love you all Michele ",

Cindy - glad to hear that you finally have some fuzz growing.  Do you look at it in the mirror everyday,OMG I drove my dh nuts doing that. Laura - race chick...hee hee:)  You are daring my dear, the speed of that car is just too much for me.  I am sorry to hear about your neice but thankfully she is in good hands right now. Deb - Yes we are having an amazing trip and way too much to drink, hey but life is to enjoy especially down here..... TracyNY - when do you go to Barbados? Sounds like you are working way too hard getting into the office at 7:00 a.m. yikes.  I am just leaving for work at that time most days.  Congrats on the walk! I have had way too many fruity drinks over the past few days...paradise passion, bahama mama, bbc (baileys, banana and cream), big bamboo (overproof rum, OMG just on sip and that was enough!).... I dont have word here so that I can do a long post so just going by memory here. Ladies, enjoy your day and will check back later! Love Michele",

Laura - I am not going to keep in touch with her, I didnt talk to her too much she was with a bunch of friends and I felt like an intruder in some ways.  I didnt want to ask her any more questions that what she offered except for how old she was when she was diagnosed, she offered the stage 4 information.  I do now her name and that she lives in Nebraska, first name only. She was telling me that her family did the relay for Life this year and their team raised $21,000!!!  What a fighter and a pillar of strength she is, she had a tattoo across her back that said \"strenght\".... Tropical Storm Noel missed Jamaica, was suppose to hit her yesterday and we were to have alot of rain, but it never transpired thankfully and is now treatening Bahamas.

      "Content": "Sep 8, 2007 05:23PM - edited Sep 9, 2007 05:56AM by Curlylocks Happy Saturday my sisters! Getting used to the board, change is hard.  The one thing I dislike is that the topics are hard to find, everything kind of blends together.  I think the old board the topics had some colour to them?  I am still waiting to hear back from my oncologist's office when my appt is with the surgeon to discuss getting my ovaries removed, hopefully they will call me next week.  What a crazy busy week it was at work, my boss is still off sick and I am trying to tackle both jobs, yikes!!  I had to make a disciplinary decision and did what I thought was right based on the facts and prior warnings in the employee's file.  My boss called me on Friday and I briefed her on what happened and she agreed with the decision that was made.    The people that bought our house came by on Friday for an hour with a contractor and their agent to get a quote to do some work, maybe \"redoing stairs\", basement, dont know.  I think they also came to check that the mortaring was done on the side of the house as per our agreement.  Their agent left a note saying that everything was fine meaning they are okay with the job that my dh did on the side of the chimney.  Hopefully they wont come back for the one more visit that they are entitled to as I so hate really cleaning the house right now if you know what I mean! Today was a beautiful sunny gorgeous day, packed a few boxes, then had a snooze, took dogs for a walk and then went to see a movie \"Mr. Bean on Holiday\".  I so love I think it is \"Rown Atkinson\", the facial expressions are priceless.LOL. Tonight I am kicking back, doing laundry and probably going to bed early as I am tired.   Debbie444 - can I call you Debbie and then I will call \"Ravdeb\" Deb as 444 on the end seems way too formal now. Did you post your pictures on snapfish?  I hope that Mark's black eye is gone and that your bump on your head is too!   Deb - I hope that your travels in the U.S. are going well and that you enjoyed your trip to Florida. Rosemarie - how did get onto snap fish again for the pictures? Where is your dh off to now? Your daughter is so cute, kids seem to notice everything.... Kelly - your login name can be changed, it is now the same as your screen name...so I think if you go back into \"my profile\" there should be an edit link to change your name back.  Paula - you are a brave soul coming to the U.S. again so soon but I guess you can get cheap flights as you work for the airline.   TracyNy - I am happy that you are all moved in and you can now take it a little easier.  Maryanne - hopefully you are just busy with paddling and work.  I keep forgetting to ask my mom about Alice Gallant and to find out whether or not we may be related?  Wouldnt that be cool? Fumi - thanks for the link, I am so not computer savy.LOL. Laura - how is your sister?  I see that you got your avtar changed back to your old screen name.   I dont eny the people running this website, its gotta be a lot of work and we get access here for nothing! Amy - havent heard from you in awhile.  Kelby must be keeping you hopping.   Cindy - how are you feeling?  Get your bike up to par as I think that you will soon be riding it again just like in your dreams.  Courage and strength have a new meaning when it comes to you sister.... Cathy - miss on the boards, hope you are doing okay? Mary - I notice that you changed your avtar to the \"cheetah picture\".   Brenda - how is school going?  See my lips are still sealed and I havent repeated your famous one liner...ha ha:) Gracyie - say hi to Ki Ki.  She is a funny gal and so full of life.  I really enjoyed meeting her. Tracyseattle - hope you enjoyed your Reno trip!  Have a great Saturday evening ladies.   Love you all Michele ",

My thoughts on gmail is that it is like an email.  I use a computer all day at work and to go through more emails when I get home is too much work.LOL.  I do like the idea of the yahoo group!  I am use to the new board format but being almost two years out of diagnosis coming here is like a constant reminder of \"cancer\". We are headed up to the trailer tomorrow night after work, cant wait to put my feet up in our lazy chairs and just listen to the crickets churp! The weather is suppose to be fabulous, maybe we will take a boat ride to see the colours on the lake.  Victoria - I have pm'd you. Laura - take some time out of your busy schedule for some r&r.  When do you have to start working on Christmas projects or should I not even mention that as Halloween has even got here.LOL. Is your sister doing a little better? Debbie - your sense of humour is awesome, poor Mark let him out of the cage, although he doesnt have a frown on his face either. Brenda - where are you my International roomate?  Did you get your masks yet? Paula - did you decide to go and visit your cousin for Thanksgiving? Rosemarie - havent heard from you either... Graycie - We will have to talk about getting together with yourself and Mary as you too live not too far from me but it will have to be in late spring as the roads are too treachous in the winter especially in Buffalo!  Maybe you can come and visit me and we can have a few drinks in our new hottub! Tracyseattle - I find that my toes and the backs of my heels hurt the worst and I hobble when I walk now especially my left foot although my right one hurts still too when I had the fight with the ladder at my parents place a few weeks ago. Cathy - I looked at the article in Real Simple, we do sell it here in Canada, it was a great article and the picture of you is wonderful. Deb - I do agree with you on the pink issue, gosh they even sell pink m&m candies.   I also agree with Laura that awareness is so important if it means preventing another women from loosing her life to this dreaded disease.  I am a sad this week that our \"Shelli\" lost her battle after fighting so blasted hard to be here for her little ones.  I was diagnosed in October so would rather forget it altogether! Glad to hear that your luggage made it back home too!  Mary - I appreciate your hard work in setting up the yahoo group, it is there if we decide to change formats. Ladies, I'm am beat....have a wonderful weekend, enjoy the sunshine! Love Michele ",

I will email you the answers separately.   TracyNy \u2013 I hope that we too can also move over to the Yahoo boards, another big step in moving on with our lives.   Kelly \u2013 your trip to Catalina island makes me jealous, is it ever pretty!  Love the pictures of your and Teryn and the jazz hands with Teryn on the beach is too cute for words!  That drink looks like it could last someone a whole night\u2026.   Brenda \u2013 you are so funny my dear, I miss your sense of raw humour.    Hope the mask helps out with your sleep.  My dad has a machine but never wears it, mom is always after him.  She is being tested for sleep apnena at a sleep clinic tomorrow night.   Paula \u2013 how are you my International roommate, I miss you too!  Is the weather still cool in Australia.  The temps here today are 11C!  Hope you feel better soon\u2026   Debbie \u2013 that sucks that you still haven\u2019t got your thyroid situation straightened out.  What kind of chemical are they giving you?   Cathy \u2013 Do you know if Real Simple is available in Canada?  I haven\u2019t seen it here?   Rosemarie \u2013 its important to have that Couple time together, good for you.  Glad you enjoyed your date!   Amy \u2013 hello, hope everything is well with you!   Have a super Saturday ladies, off to do my volunteer duties amongst all firefighters.LOLJ              ",

Thanks Maryanne, Laura and Deb -- two years and going on strong.... I have met a young women here at our resort who is 32 and is now stage 4.   She is a 2 1/2 year survivor, I dont know what stage she was diagnosed at and didnt want to be noisy but I think she was always a stage 4 but it has recently spread to her ribs and liver.   She is her+ and is now on Herceptin and Zometa for life.   She had no surgery initially but ended up doing a right mascetomy to stop the primary tumour.   Tracy is so full of life and a real sweetheart, it makes me want to scream and she also has two little ones that are 8 and 5.  This disease makes me angry sometimes, sorry have to vent...  She is going home tomorrow so I wished her all the best. Laura - we have gotten up usually around 8:00 a.m. and when your outside in the sun all day it really wears you out, OMG what a problem to have....listen to me.LOL.  Anyways...we have only made it past 10:00 pm. one night and that night we crashed at 11:30 p.m.  They had a regagee (sp) band the other night that were fantastic.  Your turn will come and I'll be freezing my butt off! Cindy - I had to have another BBB drink today and am now working on a paradise passion...what a lush I have been.... I think I will have to walk home with all the food and drink I have had this week but it has been a blast and a much needed getaway. Will check back later. Enjoy your evening Ladies! Love Michele",

My clothes are still sitting in my suitcase, guess I have to wash them this weekend and then pack them in a box.LOL.  I cannot get into my gmail as my sister was here using my computer and told the computer to remember her when she signed in, now I cant log in under my name....any ideas on how I can get in now.  It keeps wanting to flip back to her name and login when I put in mine. I will try to get back into gmail this weekend.   Love all you ladies, Maryanne what a funny cake, your surgery is towards the end of this month isnt it? Gotta run and grab a shower, photobucket is down for maintenance so will post some pics on the weekend... Michele ",

Dont beat yourself up and give yourself time to mourn the loss of your old self.  The first year I couldnt even think about years ahead because the truth is I thought I wouldnt be alive in six months.   A new self will emerge with time.  You will get through this, for me the first few years are the hardest emotionally to deal with.  It takes time to find your \"new normal\" but it will happen!",

      "Content": "Mar 16, 2008 06:20AM - edited Mar 16, 2008 06:21AM by Curlylocks Lloyd, I too found my tumour on my own after having had a clear mamo the previous year.   With younger women it is hard to find cancer, as my doctor's said it is like looking for a needle in a haystack.   I was diagnosed at age 41 with no family history of bc.  This is a tough question to answer as most lumps that are found by women themselves have been there for at least 6-8 years.  Is that early detection, I'm not sure??? In the breast cancer world early stage cancer is stage 0 (dcis), stage 1 and 2.  Stage 2 has 2 levels 2a and 2b, this depends on the size of the tumour and if any lymph nodes are involved. Early stage cancer to me ideally would be dcis.  However, I was diagnosed stage 2b as I had a 4 cm tumour and 3 positive lymph nodes.  The good news is I continue to be cancer free and this is my 3rd year of survivorship. I'm sorry that you are having to deal with this blasted disease.  The shock will wear off and then you will get angry and your wife will start fighting this disease.  This is a long tough emotional journey for both you and your wife.  I bought a book for my husband at the begining called \"The Breast Cancer Husband\" by Marc Silver, it truely was a godsend and helped him to understand the emotions and treatment aspect of this disease. My best advice is to just be there for her, especially emotionally as the not knowing, wondering what is in store for her treatment wise and just being plan scared of this whole diagnosis do take a huge toll on you.  Make sure that you take care of yourself too....dont be afraid to ask for counselling if needed as you will be no good to her if you are a basketcase too!  My husband was so angry at first he punched a hole in the wall, not a very smart thing to do.... Now 2 1/2 years later life is a \"new normal\" and I am happy, healthy and we are much closer as a couple than prior to bc. Come back here often to ask any questions that you may have and if your wife feels up to it ask her to come here too.  This board saved my sanity when I was first diagnosed! Michele ",

I was 41 when I was diagnosed 2 1/2 years ago, my tumour was invasive, 4 cm and I had 3 positive lymph nodes.  I had the kitchen sink thrown at me as far as treatment goes --- lumpectomy with the removal of 23 lymph nodes, 6 months of chemo, 5 1/2 weeks of radiation and now on hormonals.  I am know currently in remission and doing well. Please try and talk to your mom and let her know that treatments today are totally doable and the meds that they have for chemo REALLY DO WORK!!  It is not something that I want to have to repeat over but would definitely do it again, if I needed to... Your mom has lots to live for including you, she may need to talk to a counsellor to help her sort out her feelings of anger and get onto getting treatment and getting back to healthy living again.  Please tell her it is not time to give up but that it is certainly okay and NORMAL to be angry, cry when she needs to because yes this does SUCK and no one deserves to have to deal with this disease... Tell her that you love her and want to see her get well and encourage her to seek the help see needs to deal with this! All the best in helping out your mom, you are a great and caring daughter.

He was gone in 2.5 months after being diagnosed.  It makes sense when you say he could be the gene carrier. My sister who passed away was 44, she had genetic testing done about four months before she died.  Her test was negative.  Here in Canada, the guidelines are a little different than in the U.S.  They wouldnt do genetic testing on my older sister as she hadnt had breast cancer, but did genetic counselling so she could get into the High Risk Screening Program to get an MRI. I have never been tested, had an appt but cancelled it...this was before my younger sister was rediagnosed a 2nd time in March last year. At the time (it was about 2 years ago)  I didnt see any benefit in getting it done as I had my ovaries removed at age 44.  I will reschedule now for the testing so that I too can get into the High Risk Screening Program, they wont do an MRI on me unless I do...pretty stupid considering I am a bc survivor. My other sister who is ten months younger than me lives in a different part of Canada, she is eligible to go for MRI`s every year and has been for several years.  She has never been tested, again as she is not a bc survivor she wont be eligible.  Another criteria, is you have to have three living first degree family members with bc and sadly the fact that my youngest sister is no longer living they dont count here into the equation.

A little history on what is going on with my older sister....she had her regular Annual Mamogram in January this year, got a call back more testing and they determined she had cysts.  Fast forward to May 22/13 she had an MRI due to high first degree risk of bc and dense breasts.  She got a call back to go for more testing, compressed mamo and ultrasound last Thursday.  The ultrasound confirmed a 1cm lump in her right breast that needs to be biopsed.   She was originally scheduled to have that biopsy next Monday, however, got another call from the hospital saying they were cancelling that biopsy and rescheduling it for next Tuesday as they have reviewed her MRI and now want to do a biopsy of her left breast too! I am terrified that she now has bc as well.  That would make three sisters with bc.  My Mom is still alive (73) and was never diagnosed with it.  I was the first one who had the diagnosis.

It has markings on it so you can see how much is in there before you dump it.  I had my drain in for 8 days, it was uncomfortable and you have to make sure that you either pin the tubing to your clothing so it doesnt get caught or buy a drain pouch. Sleeping with the affected arm down flat hurt for a few months after the surgery, I used a pillow underneath my arm while sleeping.  Most important thing is to make sure that your medical team shows you how to do the exercises to get proper movement back into your arm. If you have any questions, send me a private message or respond here. Michele",

I am sorry that you are having to deal with this and hope that your fiance supports you to the fullest in this journey. Your tumour is quite large like mine was and due to the IDC despite negative nodes it will most likely be recommended for you.  You are also young in the world of breast cancer.   Cancer can travel through the blood stream, chemo will be an extra insurance policy in your arsenal to beat this disease.  None of us willingly sign up for chemo but you dont want to second guess your decision a little later on if this beast should come back.  Your first chance is your best bet to living a healthy long life.  I wish you the best in your bc journey, it is tough but I am proof that you can come out the other side of breast cancer.

I am 46 as well and will celebrate 5 years of survivorship next month!  My stats are similar to yours too! The waiting part of this journey is the absolute worst, it is hard on you but even harder on your loved ones.  They are freightened and are afraid of loosing you so their defensive mechanism kicks in and thats when you get the \"everything is going to be okay\" comments.  I think it is a coping mechanism. My husband had a very hard time with my diagnosis, we have been together 22 years, married for 11 years, no children. I ended up buying him the book by Marc Silverman called \"The Breast Cancer Husband\", it is written by a guy whose wife is doing through treatment and the thoughts and ways that he would relate to his wife and how he felt he could have changed things.  It is a very worthwhile read!  My husband also went to speak to someone and get anti depressants, that is how much it affected him, it is much harder on men as they tend to interalize their thoughts and feel hopeless that they cant fix this! Communication is the most important thing that will help your marriage and your family get through this very difficult emotional journey.  If you need help with something or are having a bad day take sometime to share it with your kids or your husband...honesty up front is the best! Dont be afraid to cry or have bad days cause they are many, many of them in the beginning as your mind tends to wander to places that it really shouldnt. I found out how hard it is being on the other side of dealing with breast cancer as my youngest sister was diagnosed in July and will be undergoing surgery for a second time on Tuesday due to unclear margins for her lumpectomy. This process if every hard emotionally, physically and changes your life.  You can live life beyond breast cancer, I am proof that it does happen! Love Michele",

I am no doctor but will try to help you understand your pathology report. Grade of your cancer is 1 which is good - how aggressive the cells look under a microscope and how aggressive the tumour is.  Tumours are graded as 1, 2 or 3 with 3 being the most aggressive. Tumour has both idc and dcis.  This may sound confusing but all it means is the cancer started off as being contained within the breast (dcis)  and then at some point it has invaded outside of the breast.  Most cancers are in our bodies for 6-8 years prior to being discovered.    80% of breast cancers are invasive. Estrogen receptor positive (also known as er+) is 100% which is another good trait as you will be able to take hormonal therapy (daily pill) after treatments typically for five years to help prevent a reoccurance.  This also means that the tumour was fueled by the estrogen in your body. It also looks like the progrestrone receptor although, weakly positive is positive too. Her2 status, is also another factor that will play a part in your treatment plan.  Yours is not amplified which is also another good trait!  It means that you will not have to take the drug Herceptin. I hope I have helped and not totally confused you...it sucks that you were given this report without an explanation. Michele ",

All this stuff is just too scary and hard to digest especially in the beginning.  I know what you mean by wanting to get \"the cancer\" out of your body.  When I first found out I foolishly wished there was a way I could cut it out myself.LOL It is VERY NORMAL to have the \"why me\" feelings, it is not fair that we have to deal with this diagnois while others go along happily on their merry ways without a care in the world.  If only they knew who lucky they were not to be facing this disease.  The fact is that more and more women will develop breast cancer with or without a family history (I had none) just because of the fact that we are women and have breasts.  One in eight are now affected.  It doesnt mean that you didnt anything wrong....  HUGS....as I remember this feeling well.  I remember going through chemo and seeing women with their gorgeous hair and secretly wanting to cut their hair off...warped, I dont know it helped me cope! This disease is beatable, keep that in your mind when things get rough in the next little while as you wait for surgery, results of pathlogy, treatment plan to be recommended and getting on the \"bus to beating the crap out of this cancer\"!!!!

I am a soon to be 7 year breast cancer survivor (diagnosed at age 41) now 48 with a 4cm tumour, was aggressive grade 3 and I had three positive lymph nodes.  Treatment was hard and even thinking about 6 months into the future in those early days was not an easy task. I went through a lumpectomy, 6 months of chemo, radiation, had my ovaries removed in 2008 due to the cancer being fed by estrogen (er+, pr+) and took a drug called Armidex for 5 years to hopefully prevent a future reoccurance.  I was diagnosed stage IIb.  This whole journey is tough emotionally, physically and trying to get yourself back into a \"new normal\" way of living after breast cancer is really tough.  It took me a good 3-4 years to not think about breast cancer every single minute of every day.  Fast forward to 7 years later and I can hardly believe it was me that went through all that crap!  I am healthy, breast cancer free despite positive lymph nodes and living my life beyond breast cancer.  I was never tested for the brca1 or 2 gene, my youngest sister was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 42 in 2010, she was tested for the gene and didnt not have it.  She unfortunately did not have a good outcome and left us in April of this year.  I have a really heartwarming story to share with you.  I am a part of a group of 15 breast cancer survivors that established friendships online here starting back in 2005, we are all still in communication with each other and get together once a year to celebrate life in various places.   The ages of us range from 28 at diagnosis to middle 60's.  Our youngest member of the group was 28 at diagnosis, she had just been married for 3 weeks when she was diagnosis with stage 3 breast cancer.  She went through all of her treatment incuding a double mastecomy with reconstruction, chemo.  She is doing extremely well 7 years later, adopted a little boy a little over 2 years ago and then just had her own child naturally two weeks ago when she was told she would never get pregnant!  NEVER GIVE UP HOPE!!!!  My motto is to never give up hope, life is too precious! Hang onto the positive, although things are very scary and unknown right now.  Give your precious wife a big hug and congratulations on the upcoming birth of your new son!  This board was a life saver for me in the beginning, I dont come here much anymore but like to pop in to offer hope to the newly diagnosed....kind of a way of giving back to those that helped me in the beginning.

The beginning of this journey is the hardest. You DO NOT have to give up your dreams of being a doctor.  This is a temporary setback.   I took almost a year off during treatment, lumpectomy with removal of 23 lymph nodes, 6 months of chemo and 5 1/2 weeks of radiation and then two months post recovery time.  I am lucky that I work for an employer that has an excellent benefit plan so financially it wasnt a huge burden.... I am also married and had a second income to support us. Alot of the ladies here have worked throughout treatment, taking a few days off after each infusion and have done pretty okay.  It is tough but sometimes you have no choice.  Breast cancer has thought me that life is truly precious and that those that are important in our life, family, friends will help you through this.  It is easiest when you look at this journey, one step at a time, one day at a time...baby steps.   Once you have surgery, meet with your medical team and have a treatment plan in place things will be a little easier as you feel like you are doing something to get rid of this nasty beast. Breast cancer is very treatable and many women are living long healthy lives after treatment.   I was totally devasted when I was diagnosed back in Oct 05, it seemed like life was turned upside with a few little words...\"you have cancer\".  I had no family history of breast cancer, although other cancers and had found my 4 cm lump on my own after having had a first baseline mamogram 13 months earlier that showed no maligancy.  My tumour was a grade 3 which is aggressive and fast growing with 3 positive lymph nodes.  I cried rivers of tears for months after diagnosis, crying is healthy, cleansing and NORMAL.  If you can try to seek out a counsellor that you can talk to about your feelings.  This board is also a great support line and saved my sanity when I was diagnosed. I can honestly say that life has returned to \"a new normal\" now, almost 1 1/2 year post treatment.  When I was first diagnosed all I could think about was...am I going to be here tomorrow.  Those thoughts are far and few between now and planning for the future is okay and exciting now!!! As far as strength my thoughts are that we have been dealt a crappy hand of cards and have no choice but to go through treatment to get healthy again.  You will be totally surprised how much strength, spirit and determination you have when you dig down deep inside.  This is not an easy road but you can do this like so many of us have and come out the other side of living beyond breast cancer.  Moving on does not happen overnight, I still struggle the odd time to come to terms with this whole disease and have the odd cry at the unfairness of being diagnosed so young. Come back here often to ask any questions you may have.   Your bc sister Michele ",

I had a little bit of numbness in my face and hands but it was really temporary and went away quite quickly after each infusion.  I did have sore feet but they too got better, no lasting effects from taxol at all.... Congrats on finishing the nasty red devil and all the best on the rest of your treatments! Michele ",

It sounds though like you have an early stage cancer (DCIS) like Tender said confined to the breast. Your pathology report will conirm this information and be used to determine further treatment as it will also show tumour size. One thing that was not mentioned was since you are Her2+ herceptin will be used in your treatment plan. I wish you all the best in your treatment.

He may need time to emotionally wrap his head around this and therefore it feels like he is distancing himself.  Do yourself a favour and sit down and talk with him about how you feel and what you would like him to do.  If need be, he may need someone to talk to (a professional), some hospitals have social workers that will help with family members.  If he is not coping with your diagnosis emotionally, he is not in any position to help you.  My husband was so angry that he punched a hole in the wall!  I told him at that point that if he didnt seek out help for himself he was not going to be in any position to support me emotionally.  He went to the doctor's that week and was prescribed anti depressants to help him cope. I am not saying that your husband needs anti depressants, but my diagnosis was enough to push my husband over the edge.  I also bought him a book by Mark Silver called \"The Breast Cancer Husband\", it is highly recommended...my husband read it from cover to cover and so did I.  It is written from a man's point of view on how to deal with helping your spouse through this really tough journey. Hugs, I know that it is hard trying to get through this when you feel like you \"are going it alone\". Now 5 1/2 years later, my husband and I have a exceptionally strong marriage....communication is the key. Love Michele",

My husband and I had been together for 16 years and married for 6 years when I was diagnosed so I knew our relationship was strong.  I know now that it will survive anything after dealing with the emotional aftermath of a bc diagnosis.  Many days I felt sorry for myself but more importantly felt for my husband who didnt seem to have an outlet to let out his feelings and fears.  I bought a really good book for him called \"The Breast Cancer Husband\" which is written by Marc Silverman.  Marc's wife is a breast cancer survivor and the book is written from a \"guy's\" presceptive on how women are impacted by this and what to do and not to do to be a caregiver.  If your local hospital has a social worker it may be helpful to have your husband and children talk to them if needed as well as yourself as this is a \"tough disease\" to emotionally handle.  On the days when I have the odd emotional breakdown now (yes still at 3 years out), my husband hugs me and says we are in this journey together and that is the best way to sum it up -- you and your husband are in this battle together---good and bad days... A big hug out to you as I remember the early days of diagnosis like it was yesterday, they were soo soo hard but it does get better --PROMISE! Your bc sister Michele",

Has your surgeon discussed the reasons for doing one against the other? For me this is such a personal decision that only you should make based on the results of the tests after talking to the surgeon. You have the right to a 2nd opinion, I know you just want it gone but there is time to seek another opinion and take the time to make an informed decision not one out of fear. If you are doing a mastectomy will they do immediate reconstruction, does your surgeon have a recommendation for a plastic surgeon? If chemo is recommended which it probably will be with IDC, what protocol, how often and when? Will it be dose dense (every 2 weeks) or every 3? Will you be getting injections to boost blood cell count while doing chemo? - Neupegeon(sp), can't remember other one. If so do you have a benefits plan to cover it....it is extremely expensive....$2,000 plus. OHIP does not cover the injections!. If insurance will not pay may be able to get it covered under a Special Compassionate Assistance Program (hospital should be able to give you application). Is it possible for them to do a sentinel node biopsy versus a full auxiliary node dissection?Sorry cant remember whether or not you addressed this in your first post. Sential node will cut down on risk of lymphedema (unfortunately I was just diagnosed with it a few months ago..not something you want!) Once you have your er/pr status (this won't happen until after surgery and you get your pathology report...you will need your er/pr status to determine if you can take tamoxifen and/or one of the AI's if you are put into menopause either chemically with injections or permanently through ovary removal. I hope I haven't overwhelmed you...let us know how things go and I hope things turn out okay with scans! Michele",

Remaining cancer free for 5 years is wonderful but does not determine your chances of reoccurance or dying from bc. Breast cancer is a crap shoot and as someone said early on in my journey which started 3 years ago for me, you are either 100% alive or 100% dead.  I prefer to say that I am 100% alive because I am!! Estrogen positive women have a lifetime risk, whereas women that are triple negative have a higher survival rate once they hit the 5 year mark although their cancers tend to be more aggressive.  I have gone through treatment and remain cancer free 3 years out.   No one can predict what is going to happen to a person as far as survival as everyone responds differently to treatment, most do well and some unfortunately do not.  Some ladies that have a poor prognosis outlast others that a good prognosis. As you can see the last part of your question is a really hard one to answer as no one knows.",

Hearing the words \"you have cancer\" has changed my life forever, I am not the same person I was 2 years ago.  I am no longer have a carefree attitude about my health or life.  I cherish my husband, family, friends even more than I ever have, they were my \"rocks\" in getting through a very difficult road of treatment, lumpectomy, 6 months of chemo, radiation and then hormonal treatments.  The first days, weeks and months following my diagnosis I cried alot, wondered why this happened to me so young with no family history of bc, was angry, constantly thought about cancer and that I was going to die.I would not dare think long term with respect to the future.  Crying is good for you and also very normal and healthy through this process.  I ended up having to go on a antidrepressant 1 month prior to the end of chemo as my system went into overloaded and I was not sleeping or processing any of this in a healthy way. I am still on an antidepressant but I find it keeps me on an even keel. I tried to keep busy and had the cleanest house in town while I was awaiting all my test results.  Reading a good book also helped. Deb - a big hug to you my friend, once you have a treatment plan in place you will feel a little more in control of your life.  It does get easier with each day, think \"baby steps\", one day at a time.  If you are having problems sleeping \"ativan\" does take the edge off and will allow you to sleep.  Dont worry about having to take meds right now to get through this hardest part, sleep is really important to your overall wellbeing. Dont look at the overall picture especially when you start to think about treatment.  It takes the better part of a year of your life but the tradeoff is awesome, being brought back to a healthy person once again!  I'm crossing my fingers that your sister's results are beign. I still find it hard to believe sometimes that I am a breast cancer survivor.  It is so hard to accept and being numb right now is your body's way of slowly digesting all this..... Life now is good and relatively \"normal\", I dont think about cancer constantly and enjoy life's fun moments...   Barb - I hope that you get good news on your test results this week. Have a good night's sleep ladies and stay warm! Michele ",

A/C is commonly used for treatment of agressive grade III cancers and node positive cancers.  It does have a small percentage of problems with heart toxicity.  I am 4 years out of chemo and have had no long term side effects from a/c or taxol.  It is difficult emotionally going through this journey.  It is comforting to have a family member or friend with you during treatments. to keep you company.  My younger sister was diagnosed with breast cancer in July of this year at age 43 and she had a larger tumour than myself but no positive lymph nodes amazingly! She unfortunately had to have a masectomy of her left breast due to unclear margins after surgery.  Her chemo drugs are 3 FEC - which is the \"E\" drug that you were speaking of and 3 taxtotere (which is the sister drug to taxol).  So in 5 years the same oncology clinic that I had gone to is using FEC more often as it is said to have a lesser effect on the heart.  Who knows.... I wish your mom all the best during her treatment, there is HOPE and never forget that! I am proof of that!!! Michele",

My new bc is triple negative, 1 cm but due to the aggressiveness of TN I started 4 rounds of chemo started last Tuesday. Pathology will test whether or not there has been a spread to the lymph nodes.  If it is true DCIS, it should be contained within the ducts.  But until you get the pathology back there is no way of knowing 100%. It can only invade the lymph nodes if there is a mixture of IDC with the DCIS. HER2 Positive bc used to be a scary diagnosis until the introduction of Herceptin woman having been living many, many years...never give up HOPE!   Regardless of whether this is a new diagnosis or a reoccurance, treatment will be the same.  Your K167 is pretty high, which means that the cancer cells when looked at under a microscope are dividing very quickly...talk to your doctors about treatment including chemo and radiation.  Herceptin would be a definite. Try not to think the worst...I know it is hard.  If the pathology report reveals DCIS, I am not sure if it would warrant a PT Scan.  They are normally done when you have an invasive component.

My treatment was 4 a/c and 4 taxol.  I had 3 out of 23 positive nodes thus the extra 4 treatments of chemo.  I also had a lumpectomy with radiation, had my ovaries removed last May and am on Armidex (hormonal) drug to help prevent reoccurance for 3 years now.  Most women do loose their hair during chemo, for me it was the most traumatic part of chemo.  But it is only TEMPORARY for a good part of about 9 months and it grows back in alot of cases curly and thick, thick.  I had long curly ringlets past my shoulders before I lost my hair, got it cut short in preparation for loosing it.  I cried my eyes out when it started to fall out but then my husband shaved it off for me so it wouldnt all just come out on Christmas Day in the shower.  I did loose my eyelashes and eyebrows.  I got really good at drawing fake eyebrows and well the eyelashes just let it be.  My eyebrows and lashes came back fairly quickly about 3 weeks after the end of chemo finished.  I didnt have any problems with my nails, except my little one turned black but never fell off.  Everyone is different in how they handle this disease, the emotional impact is the hardest...it is similar to going through the grieving process.  You are grieving the loss of your old carefree life prior to bc, denial and anger are the first steps of it.  At a much later date the acceptance will come...be kind to yourself...baby steps will get your through this...one day at a time.

I am 44 and was diagnosed at 41 back in Oct 05 with IDC that was highly er/pr+, also had 3 positive nodes.  My oncologist recommended that I get my ovaries removed and had them out a little less than 2 weeks ago.  The first day was extremely painful and I slept alot the first week but have returned to work on Friday and all is good. The gynecologist that my oncologist referred me to was totally for removing my ovaries and said it made perfect sense due to my er/pr+ status.  I no longer have to take the injections now and can remain on Armidex.  The surgery is pretty quick about an hour.  I was chemically menopausal due to Zoladex injections so the transition for me was not that bad hormonally, my nightsweats are a little worse but sleeping with the fan on has helped ALOT! All the best in your decision.  Its a tough one.... Michele ",

This journey is really tough emotionally and physically but it does get easier as time goes by.   Your are at the worst part of this journey, the beginning, so many unknowns, questions, fear and wanting to just \"get the cancer out\". Take your time in making a decision re: surgery, your medical team, etc as most cancers have been there for at least 5-7 years prior to discovery.   This board was my lifesaver in the beginning days, thus the reason I come back to \"pay if forward\" for all the support I received when I needed it most. It is nice to hear that you have a loving, supportive husband and some beautiful children to help you through this journey. Hugs tonight as I remember the day of diagnosis like it was yesterday Michele",

My understanding of an snb is that they use die to trace to the main sentinal node that is the first node that feeds into the breast.  This is normally tested first to determine if there is cancer in the lymph nodes as this would be the first node it would hit.  In doing this procedure it looks like they may have taken a few extra in the process, in your case this is good as they were able to determine that there are 3 positive nodes.  They may go back and do a full auxillary node dissection as part of your masectomy to make sure there are no more positive nodes.  This helps to stage your cancer as well as setup a treatment plan for you. I had a full auxillary node dissection, skipped the snb as my doctor knew that I would have positive nodes due to the size of my tumour. They took a section of tissue out in the auxila area under my arm and that contained 23 lymph nodes so 5 is small in comparison.  It is also my understanding that radiation is not normally a part of treatment with a masectomy.  Chemo may be recommended in your case as you have positive nodes.  Hormonal theraphy also if your tumour is er/pr+ which means that the cancer was fueled by the estrogen in your body.  Hormonal theraphy is a drug to help prevent reoccurance.  The er/pr status is normally available with your pathology report after surgery, mine took about a week.  This helps determine what your course of treatment will be. Hang in there, it is scary and we always have our minds imaging the worst.  Dont panic if they ask you to have further scans done after this.  It is usually standard for IDC and helps stage your cancer and determine treatment too.  I had a chest xray, bone scan, liver/abdomen scan and thankfully everything was clear.  They use these scans as well for a baseline if they need to later on. Big hugs and hope that your surgery goes well. Michele ",

I am a 7.5 year survivor of stage IIb IDC (Invasive Ductal Carcinoma), had a 4 cm tumour and 3 positive lymph nodes.   I was diagnosed at age 41, will be 49 in May:) Treatment was tough but certainly dobable, especially chemo with the meds that they have available now, no one should have to suffer needlessly!  Emotionally was the biggest challenge for me, knowing that initially you had your whole life ahead of you, carefree not a worry in the world and then BAM this crap hits you!  Learning to not let breast cancer overtake your life is a struggle for most, but it does come eventually and we learn to live a \"New Normal\". For the first 2 years or so cancer occupied my thoughts every second of every day, but now I can go for days without thinking about it.  It takes alot of work but you will learn how to get there baby steps at a time.  If you need to seek out counselling to get you through some rough patches, certainly go for it, some women end up taking anti depressants for awhile.  I had never taken any medication in my life until I was diagnosed with bc, I went about treatment like a robot and then it hit me about a month before I finished chemo.  I took anti depressants for 2.5 years but have been off them for over 4 years and doing well! If friends, family offer up support during surgery, treatment, accept it.  It is time to take care of yourself and the rest will fall into place. Big hugs as I know how scary all this can be.  I made it through the other side of bc, why cant you too? Michele",

I was diagnosed at age 41 in October 05, had a lumpectomy with the full auxillary node dissection, 6 months of chemo and 5 1/2 weeks of radiation, now on Armidex and Zoladex injections.  I will be getting my ovaries removed on May 26 to eliminate the Zoladex injections and so that I can stay on Armidex as I was pre-menopausal prior to bc diagnosis. Feel free to pm me with any questions that you have about chemo.  It is a tough physically and emotionally exhausting experience as is the whole bc journey.  I was not physically ill with all eight of my treatments except for the first one, once my anti nausea meds were changed I was okay. What chemo regime are you having?  I had 4 a/c and 4 taxol due to the positive lymph nodes.   Here are some chemo tips that I have learned during my treatments: - take prescribed meds on time or it will be hard to keep nausea under control - drink lots of fluids, if water starts to get old or taste bad, try adding some lemon or crystal light to it - take senekot with stool softner as the meds and the chemo drugs will constipate you, I took 2 every night before bed for about the first week of every treatment - listen to your body and sleep when you are tired, fatigue is a very big part of chemo, nothing like I have experienced before - dont be afraid to ask for help, especially if you have little ones...take others up on offers to help clean, cook meals, run to the store, etc... <> - cut your hair short prior to treatment, makes it easier when it starts to fall out, when it does start coming out ---be kind to yourself and shave it off makes it emotionally easier to handle than to have big clumps coming out in your hand.  My husband so lovely shaved my head 2 days before xmas in Dec 05---this was the TOUGHEST part of the whole chemo experience loosing my long curly locks... - buy bandanas, wigs, hats or whatever you plan on wearing prior to loosing your hair - if you are having any side effects that are uncomfortable, call your oncologist's office and let them know so that it can be taken care of Most of all you dont have to be positive all the time, scream, yell and cry when you think that you cant do anymore.  There is light at the end of this big long tunnel---I am proof that you can come out the other side of this disease and start living a \"new normal\" life!

Chemo started for me about three weeks after surgery.  Did your doctor give you any exercises to increase your range of motion for your arm?  The one that is most common is to stand up close to a wall and crawl your hands up the wall slowly-- this helps with the stretching and getting some of that motion back. Try to do a little more every day as it will become a little easier too....  I hope that your soreness goes away, mine took a few months not so much on the breast incision area where the tumour was removed but the incision where the lymph nodes were taken and the drain incision.  I found that sleeping with a pillow underneath my arm really helped with the soreness at night. Let me know how you are doing? Your bc sister Michele ",

It does get easier to handle this diagnosis with time, I still think about cancer everyday but it does not overtake my thoughts and does not prevent me from LIVING life to its fullest.  You will get there too!!

      "Content": "Oct 7, 2008 07:20PM - edited Oct 7, 2008 07:24PM by Curlylocks Hi Swimangel I had an oopherectomy in May, stage IIb here, also highly er/pr+ - 44 years young.  It was done laproscopically and a fairly easy surgery, I am glad that I no longer have to worry about my ovaries. <>Just my luck for the first time in my life I unfortunately had high grade precancerous cells of my cervix last fall, discovered on a routine pap.  I had a cone biopsy to remove the area at the same time as my oopherectomy this past May.  If the cells come back abnormal again on my followup, the rest of my female parts are going for it too....dont need any more worries about constant followup. I asked about a total hysterectomy when I found out about the high grade cells but my gynecologist didnt want to do it because if the cells came back invasive they would have done the wrong time of hyster.  If it turn out invasive, I would have needed the surgery at a cancer hospital.  Will see what happens next month at my followup....",

That's good that your doctor is giving you the exercises to do, they are important!
