I will be getting a biopsy in a couple of days to check what this lump is and will report back with what the results are. All I know is that it is definitely NOT a cyst and it could be a fibroadenoma or breast cancer. I know fibroadenoma's have a more circumscribed looking shape which is why I am concerned it is breast cancer as it doesn't look very round. On one angle it sort of has a triangular shape where the point is facing down. It is a bit angular and has few mini 'tentacular' arms. It is 1.19cm by 0.76cm so not very big. Please leave a comment for some advice on what to expect as I am quite nervous, thanks Log in to post a reply",
