Got to celebrate those milestones. ",

You are going about everything so well, get as much information and opinions that you can. The decision to have adjuvent versus neoadjuvent should probably also include information about your hormone and Her2 status. Neoadjuvant is good for both seeing if they can shrink the tumor size and also used if your cancer is fast growing and aggressive. I think I would push for more information about the type, stage of your cancer, and hormone/Her2 status so that you can make the most informed decision possible. Don't forget to ask for copies of all pathology reports and then ask the doc's to explain each section.",
