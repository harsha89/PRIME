I highly recommend getting an MRI, it gave me such a level of comfort, there truly was nothing else but these small papillomas (smallest I have ever had).   So now the wait is on, in the mean time I am trying to come up with the $$$$ to pay for a mastectomy and reconstruction, since my insurance is not very good. I would rather get a sports car.",
