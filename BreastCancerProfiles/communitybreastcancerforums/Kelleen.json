That same day I had a mammogram and ultrasound then was sent to a breast surgeons office. The following day I was told I had breast cancer and had a biopsy.  The biopsy result came back benign but my dr still wanted to do surgery to be certain. A week later I had the lump removed. About three months later in the same breast, I found another large lump. About a month after finding this one my dr again wanted to remove it. Again coming back benign. In October I found a third lump in the same breast. Not feeling comfortable with my breast dr and not wanting a third surgery in a year, I decided to get a second opinion. She reviewed all of my records and had her pathology team look at everything. She called me to confirm that I have pash. She then had me have a mammogram and a breast MRI. I was called the following day to confirm that there are no signs of cancer. Great news!  I go this month to discuss pash, the new lump and the next steps. I fear being told that I will again need surgery to remove the lump. I cannot find any information on pash recurring so often and growing so large, so quickly.  Has anyone had any issues with pash recurring in the same breast?",
