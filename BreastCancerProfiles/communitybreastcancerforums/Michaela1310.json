I had them checked by the Nurse at my g.p. surgery, who confirmed that there were 2 lumps. She advised that I see my G.P, who referred me to a Breast Clinic. I had an examination by a Nurse Practitioner, and was sent for a Mammogram and Ultrasound. The Mammogram and US results were within 'normal limits' as was the Clinical Exam. The Nurse mentioned that it was possible that there could have been a cyst, which had since disappeared. The difficulty I am having, is understanding how both lumps are still present, but nothing was picked up on either the Mammogram or the Ultrasound? Also, apart from explaining that one of the lumps was a possible cyst, nothing was mentioned of the other one. I had a full hysterectomy in 2004, and have never been on H.R.T. I have not had any children, and as far as I am aware, there is no family history of Breast Cancer. I don't want to be making a fuss or bothering people if it is unnecessary, and just wondered if anyone else had experienced similar, or whether I should consider asking for a second opinion? Thank you in advance.. Log in to post a reply",
