I had the core biopsy done 5-8-13 Path results ( which I have not physically seen mind you- but requested) read lobar tissue benign with atypical finding- thus inconclusive! This is what my GP stated to me over the cell phone... I've read pathology reports.. And this does not sound like one to me!!!! So now I must go for more testing- and I still have not met w my GP and have not received my path report! I did receive a letter from the breast center of the core biopsy procure they conducted on my left breast ( mass at 4' o'clock w septations ) Has anyone else felt they had THIER GP reading something incorrectly or using wrong terminology??? Hyperplasia/ hyperplastic.... Ok- changing cells even!!! Heck- I liked the benign!!! Yaaaahoooooo!!!!! I'm confused in an area I thought I had a handle in- on- ive been though cancer before.... Had the cervix removed and called it good!!! Now I'm 42 and inconclusive size A's?????? Any help would b great.... I'm lost and in a new area.... Is this a normal reading??? Should I go back in two months once they are healed???? Keep in mind the 24th I have genetic counseling ( Brcas) then thermography........ Thanks sooo much!!!! Butterfly Log in to post a reply",
