At least the probability of a new malignancy has been ruled out - for now! I'll leave the surgeon and oncologist to decide on the timing of the new surgery.  I'll keep you posted.  Thanks again for your concern and support. xox",

So I'm going to have a new ultrasound in three weeks' time and see. Thank you again for your concern. xoxo ",

      "Content": "Kohinoor wrote: I had a lumpectomy for ILC in late July followed by a 25/5 radiation course. I've been put on Tam 1.5 months ago. I had a breast ultra sound two days ago. The radiologist noted a small lesion that she graded BIRAD 4C. She recommended an ultra sound true cut pathology. My surgeon seconded this opinion saying there is a probability this is a new malignancy. The question is how could this have gone undetected only two months ago when I had the mammogram, US and MRI? The doctor said it could have been very small to be detected and the radiation actually made it grow. Radiation treatment was supposed to destroy any rogue cells and not to activate new tumors. Am I missing something? Does this make sense? Please help answer my questions. I'm worried sick. Cheers!
