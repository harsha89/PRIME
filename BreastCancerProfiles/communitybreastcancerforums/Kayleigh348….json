I say \"moderate amounts of soy\" because there's alot of controversy about soy and those of us with hormone positive cancers.  This is what my research has told me:  soy protein isolate, the stuff that they cram into protein bars, powders and even some fake meat products, is not natural and too conentrated...this is not healthy.  But minimally processed soy, such as tofu, tempeh, edamame and unsweetened soy milk are a more natural form of the bean and the proteins are not overly concentrated enough to mess with hormone levels.  In fact, in countries where this type of soy is consumed regularly there are MUCH lower rates of BC (like practically none!)  Still, there's much research to be done on the issue so my personal approach is to limit my soy intake to a couple times per week and only the minimally processed stuff. Not sure you needed all this info,lol, but hope it helps anyway!",

Speaking of which, KS1, I wondered about the neuropathy too, since it was after beginning Taxotere that my symptoms began.  But my onc says that the peripheral neuropathy from taxanes starts in the fingers (or toes) and works its way up the arms (or legs)...and that it is bilateral, never just on one side.  But it does have me wondering...I have often not fit the typical model in this breast cancer journey, so who knows?",

      "Content": "Aug 30, 2009 05:58PM - edited Aug 30, 2009 06:01PM by Kayleigh3483 Same thing happened to me -- clear during surgery (uni skin/nip sparing mx w/immed ped TRAM recon) then the final path report showed .7mm in 1st of 2 sentinel nodes. My surgeon felt chemo will take care of it and doesn't recomend doing axillary dissection.  One onc wanted me to remove more nodes but changed his mind after speaking to the surgeon.  A second oncologist wants me to have axillary removed no matter what. There are two additional issues for me -- one is that I had skin necrosis and have an open wound so no surgery for me until after chemo in order to give the wound time to heal.  However that defeats one of the purposes, namely that when they remove the rest of the axillary thanks to chemo they will most likely all show as clear...whether they were before chemo or not.  So I won't really know if there was more lymph nodes involved. The other issue is that my surgeon thinks my positive sentinel node was likely from displacement -- sometimes during biopsies or surgeries microscopic cancer cells can be displaced from the original tumor and end up in the first node.  So how do I know if the cancer migrated there of its own volition or if it got there via surgery?  I don't. Since I'm going to do chemo and since there is a question about whether or not to do an axillary dissection in my case...and since I had an Oncotype score of 16, I'm probably going to forgoe the removal of any more nodes.  Either way, I have time to think. My advice?  No matter what, if there is only a microinvasion insist that you get Oncotype done anyway...even if it doesn't help decide about chemo there is valuable info to be had about one's specific tumor that you might need down the line - who knows?  Lots of docs won't do Oncotype w/any positive nodes but I insisted and am glad to have that info now. In any case, much good luck to all!",

Well, it sounded extreme to me too at first but so far between 3 docs (1 surg, 2 onc) they all concur that chemo is needed...I had 3 tumors, the largest of which was 1.3 cm.  But otherwise I've got good stats, as it were, strongly ER/PR + and HER2 - etc. I'm still seeking opinions and have some time while I'm waiting for my necrotic wound issue to heal. Oncotype is a 21 gene assay that has been used for those with node negative BC as a tool to determine the efficacy of chemo for preventing a recurrence.  The scores are divided into low, intermediate and high and assigned a number.  I'm in the low group (18&under) which would probably mean that without my little smidge of micromets in that pesky node I would be able to skip chemo and go straight to hormones.  That's why I'm seeking a number of opinions so I don't end up going overboard. It's a tough decision...chemo can wreak havoc certainly, but so can removing more nodes, as Artemis said, the more they yank, the higher the risk of lymphedema.  I've said it before, these are decisions not fit for a mortal. May we all be healed by whatever choices we make!",

For some women the focus is about getting peace of mind, which of course is totally rational and understandable.  But for me personally, with my own unique psychological make-up, it was about coming out of this as unscathed as possible and emotionally that meant doing the minimal amount of surgery/treatment I needed.  I want to be safe, but I couldn't deal with doing anything more than necessary. Again, that's what has worked for me so far.  I think you need to assess the whole picture, the kind of person you are.  Try to project yourself 10 years from now...what do you think is important?  Even try to imagine what you'd feel like if the cancer came back.  For me, I felt I would be able to face it again if I had to.  If that thought sends terror thru your veins than your needs are clearly different than mine. Each of us has to fight this in the best way we can.  That being said, these are some of the MOST difficult decision we could ever be faced with.  They don't seem fit for mortals to make.  We just have to do the best we can.  May the choices you make fill you with peace & health. PS:  I don't want to give you medical advice, but is there a reason that you need to rush to make this decision before MRI's and BRCA testing?  I would think you have time to do these things beforehand.  The more info you make your decision armed with, the better.  But of course, I may not be understanding your situation clearly.",
