I was a little skeptical because my husband got some capsules from a random person he met while at work. The Kratom does not show what kind of strain it is. I\u2019ll have to do a little more digging looking at ingredients and what not. It\u2019s worth a try! At this point my BX surgery was May 9 and I have expanders in and I just cannot get used to them. Some days the pain is worse than others and I don\u2019t want to be on opioids. I\u2019m alsogoing to try CBD oil this weekend. Overall, I think the natural route is the best route. I thank you again for this thread.",

I couldn\u2019t agree more about the government interference with opioid procurement and the reluctance to make marijuana legal. My husband just picked up Kratom and I was concerned about taking it. I had a BX with tissue expanders on May 9. I\u2019m on my last three Norco, and the incision pain and the pain from the fills is still very real. NDAIDS do nothing nor does the Arnica that a friend got for me. Are there any side effects to taking kratom? I\u2019m on Tamoxifen now and wondered if you or anyone knows of any issues taking both. Of course much of the research I\u2019ve been doing includes the dangerous side of a natural drug like kratom. Big Pharma could be behind much of this. There\u2019s also plenty of good information about the benefits of taking it. Thanks in advance!",
