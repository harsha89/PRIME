      "Content": "britbaby wrote: SISTERS A young wife sat on a sofa on a hot humid day, Drinking iced tea and visiting with her Mother. As They talked about life, about marriage, about the Responsibilities of life and the obligations of Adulthood, the mother clinked the ice cubes in her Glass thoughtfully and turned a clear, sober glance Upon her daughter.   'Don't forget your Sisters,' she advised, swirling The tea leaves to the bottom of her glass. 'They'll Be more important as you get older. No matter how Much you love your husband, no matter how much you Love the children you may have, you are still going To need Sisters. Remember to go places with them now And then; do things with them.'   'Remember that 'Sisters' means ALL the women... Your girlfriends, your daughters, and all your other Women relatives too. 'You'll need other women. Women Always do.'   What a funny piece of advice!' the young woman Thought. Haven't I just gotten married? Haven't I just joined the couple-world? I'm now a Married woman, for goodness sake! A grownup! Surely My husband and the family we may start will be all I Need to make my life worthwhile!'   But she listened to her Mother. She kept contact With her Sisters and made more women friends each Year. As the years tumbled by, one after another, She gradually came to understand that her Mom really Knew what she was talking about. As time and nature Work their changes and their mysteries upon a woman, Sisters are the mainstays of her life.   After more than 50 years of living in this world, Here is what I've learned:   THIS SAYS IT ALL:   Time passes. Life happens. Distance separates. Children grow up. Jobs come and go. Love waxes and wanes. Men don't do what they're supposed to do. Hearts break. Parents die. Colleagues forget favors. Careers end. BUT.........   Sisters are there, no matter how much time and how Many miles are Between you. A girl friend is never farther away Than needing her can reach.   When you have to walk that lonesome valley and you Have to walk it by yourself, the women in your life Will be on the valley's rim, cheering you on, Praying for you, pulling for you, intervening on Your behalf, and waiting with open arms at the Valley's' end.   Sometimes, they will even break the rules and walk Beside you...Or come in and carry you out.   Girlfriends, daughters, granddaughters, Daughters-in-law, sisters, sisters-in-law, Mothers, Grandmothers, aunties, nieces, cousins, and extended Family, all bless our life!   The world wouldn't be the same without women, and Neither would I. When we began this adventure called Womanhood, we had no idea of the incredible joys or Sorrows that lay ahead. Nor did we know how much we Would need each other.   Every day, we need each other still. Pass this on To all the women who help make your life meaningful. I just did. Short and very sweet:   There are more than twenty angels in this world. Ten are peacefully sleeping on clouds. Nine are Playing. And one is reading her email at this Moment.   yvonne Dx 9/2007, DCIS, <1cm, Stage IV, Grade 1, 0/1 nodes, mets, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

Before and after my Taxol I get tagamet, zofran and benedryl and I am always fine just tired first couple of days but nothing really exhausting I still can function. As for that nurse she needs to be in another line of business as her code of ethics SUCKS!!! I have worked in the medical field and the first thing you are is the CODE OF ETHICS!!!, plus if you are unable are unable to show empathy to your patients then you are in the wrong job, plus had it been a nurse of mine she would be in hospital right now with an anal disorder as I would have put my foot up her arse and knocked her Sh-t back a week, pardon my french ladies as I have low tolerance for such un professional medical workers, and there are many. I am glad you complained Tracy, but she needs reporting to the medical board and her licsense revoking..Truely...I will keep you in my thoughts and prayers Tracy...Luv Yvonne",

I put that header on my post as I thank God every day for my Girls and for Michelle who is my mentor and my rock, she is a very passionate woman when it comes to cancer and she knows fully how it feels to be told that you have it, luckily from a mothers stand point I was glad in her case it wasn't cancer, but she is my advocate with my treatment process, although it is sad to that it seems to have fallen on her more than my middle girl, my youngest has had to deal with a lot as she is here with me 24/7 and has been through some of my worse moments, that has been very hard on her, but anyway I am thankful that Michelle has somewhere to come and share her fears with, as I know she has been scared from day one of my journey with this dam disease. I also wanted to thank the ladies who read my story on my web page at (caringbridge) and left a message, that was nice of you ladies to do that. I know Michelle posted it was good news on my scan results and I am very happy but still very causcious as I know how quick things could change as we all know that. But thank you ladies and thanks for being there for my girl, I do come in here and read up on how you are all doing but don't always post, but that doesn't mean I don't care, God Bless you all...Yvonne (mimi1030's) Mom xoxoxoxoxoxoxoxox yvonne Dx 9/2007, DCIS, <1cm, Stage IV, Grade 1, 0/1 nodes, mets, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "britbaby wrote: I RECIEVED THIS TODAY AND THOUGHT IT WAS THE FUNNIEST THING I'VE READ LATELY, SO I THOUGHT I WOULD SHARE IT WITH ALL YOU LADIES AS IT MAY MAKE YOU LAUGH AS IT DID ME....YVONNE  Dear Mr. Thatcher,   I have been a loyal user of your \u2018Always' maxi pads for over 20 years and I appreciate many of their features. Why, without the LeakGuard Core or Dri-Weave absorbency, I'd probably never go horseback riding or salsa dancing!!, and I'd certainly steer clear of running up and down the beach in tight, white shorts. But my favorite feature has to be your revolutionary Flexi-Wings. Kudos on being the only company smart enough to realize how crucial it is that maxi pads be aerodynamic. I can't tell you how safe and secure I feel each month knowing there's a little F-16 in my pants. Have you ever had a menstrual period, Mr. Thatcher? Ever suffered from the curse'? I'm guessing you haven't. Well, my time of the month is starting right now. As I type, I can already feel hormonal forces violently surging through my body. Just a few minutes from now, my body will adjust and I'll be transformed into what my husband likes to call \u2018an inbred hillbilly with knife skills.' Isn't the human body amazing? As Brand Manager in the Feminine-Hygiene Division, you've no doubt seen quite a bit of research on what exactly happens during your customers monthly visits from \u2018Aunt Flo'. Therefore, you must know about the bloating, puffiness, and cramping we endure, and about our intense mood swings, crying jags, and out-of-control behavior. You surely realize it's a tough time for most women. In fact, only last week, my friend Jennifer fought the violent urge to shove her boyfriend's testicles into a George Foreman Grill just because he told her he thought Grey's Anatomy was written by drunken chimps. Crazy! The point is, sir, you of all people must realize that America is just crawling with homicidal maniacs in Capri pants... Which brings me to the reason for my letter. Last month, while in the throes of cramping so painful I wanted to reach inside my body and yank out my uterus, I opened an Always maxi-pad, and there, printed on the adhesive backing, were these words: \u2018Have a Happy Period.' Are you fucking kidding me? What I mean is, does any part of your tiny middle-manager brain really think happiness - actual smiling, laughing happiness is possible during a menstrual period? Did anything mentioned above sound the least bit pleasurable? Well, did it, James? FYI, unless you're some kind of sick S&M freak, there will never be anything \u2018happy' about a day in which you have to jack yourself up on Motrin and Kahlua and lock yourself in your house just so you don't march down to the local Walgreen's armed with a hunting rifle and a sketchy plan to end your life in a blaze of glory. For the love of God, pull your head out, man! If you just have to slap a moronic message on a maxi pad, wouldn't it make more sense to say something that's actually pertinent, like \u2018Put down the Hammer' or \u2018Vehicular Manslaughter is Wrong', or are you just picking on us? Sir, please inform your Accounting Department that, effective immediately, there will be an $8 drop in monthly profits, for I have chosen to take my maxi-pad business elsewhere. And though I will certainly miss your Flex-Wings, I will not for one minute miss your brand of condescending bull shit. And that's a promise I will keep. Always.
