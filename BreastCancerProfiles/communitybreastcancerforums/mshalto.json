Had a fine needle biopsy yesterday and made the mistake of asking the doctor if she's seen lymph nodes as big as mine, which is 3 cm. She replied that 3 cm was pretty big. Don't ask if you don't wanna know, I guess!  When my onco looked at it on Monday, she said she really couldn't tell if this is a worrisome situation  until the results of the tissue biopsy are back, which won't be until sometime next week. She did ask if I had synptoms suspicious for lymphoma--I had none of 'em. Weight loss? Loss of appetite? Uh--NO WAY! :) My bloodwork is fine but onco said that good bloodwork doesn't necessarily mean a good result. Don't get me wrong--she's a WONDERFUL doctor and I know I'm reading way too much into every nuance of what she says, her facial expressions, tone of voice, etc. Anxiety levels are as high as they were a year ago Sept. when I got my dx. I do feel kind of silly being obsessed with this when so many others here are dealing with very difficult scenarios, but hoping to hear from someone... many thanks- Miriam Dx 9/18/2008, IDC, 1cm, Stage IB, Grade 1, 0/3 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

All the pathologists know right now is that it's aggressive (stage 3 or 4) but they're having trouble determining the primary cancer. They know that it's not bc mets. Certain signs point to the genitourinary area, gastrointestinal, anal..the list goes on.  Having a PET scan Tuesday and then an anoscopy (sp?).  If those don't reveal anything , then CT/MRI.   There's a chance that this could just be what they refer to as CUP (Cancer w/ Unknown Primary). Obviously in shock but more or less functional. With bad news, I tend to go into business mode, i.e., gathering all the info I can from the docs, etc. I guess it's a self-protective device, and it's working for me right now. Emotions will come later....it helps to blunt feelings right now with anti-anxiety meds, which is helping me cope with activities ranging from work, telling my mother and sister, doing laundry without losing too many socks :), and reading way too many silly magazines like People, Us, etc...... It's funny where your mind goes when you're in shock from news like this. For me, it's not been \"how long do I have to live\", but instead I obsess about making sure I get every anti-nausea med in the book during chemo, as I am deathly afraid of vomiting-aka emetophobic. Well, just wanted to update you guys. Any support would be more than welcome... Thanks, Miriam and her Very Naughty Lymph Node (if I can't joke a bit I'll totally lose it...)

I guess the next step is bloodwork to determine if there is underlying infection and then biopsy. I finished treatment (lumpectomy and rads) last December and started Tamox. in January, followed by Zoladex in August. I highly doubt this enlargement is due to meds.....and I feel absolutely fine! No colds, flu, etc... I was really hoping for a hernia. Damn.  Now it's back to worry mode....this time, I have promised myself to stay off the internet (Except for here :)    and I intend to keep that promise.

Obviously not thrilled by the fact that it's spread there along with the groin lymph node, but I'm relieved to finally have what is a hopefully definitive answer. Seeing a colorectal surgeon for anoscopy/exam sometime next week. Right now, treatment plan includes possibly concurrent rads/chemo, since the cells in biopsy were aggressive. Sounds like Stage IIIb or IV, but what do I know??  I just like to make believe I'm a doctor to amuse my friends, family, and patient husband. :) I'm blessed to be surrounded by the greatest of friends, family, of course aforementioned husband (#1 Good Guy), to be living in Boston w/ access to (hopefully) a top anal doc--ha!     Perhaps I should be professional and say butt-doc.
