      "Content": "Apr 2, 2013 02:15PM blessed-to-be-alive wrote: I was happy that I ran across this discussion board.  I was diagnosed with stage 2, grade 3 lobular breast cancer almost 2 years ago.  I was told I had no choice other than a mastectomy.  I chose to remove both breasts because I was a high risk for it to move to the other breast (my older sister also had breast cancer) and I did not ever want to repeat what I was going through at the time. The tumor had gorwn to 5 cm.  I used Scott and White and had great doctors.  Dr. John Hendricks was my surgeon ( absolutely loved him and the time he took with me and my family to answer questions).  Dr. Christopher Ruud was my oncologist.  Dr Mundy my radiation doctor.  I had 16 chemo treatments.  I had 3 different kinds.  All had different side effects.  I never knew what to expect.  I too, developed nueropathy and osteo-arthritis from the chemo.  I had 32 radiation treatments.  I worked part time through it all.  My hausband is a pastor and I didn't miss many services through it all.  I think it was good for me to try and keep going even when I didn't feel like it.  I am blessed with great employers. I made the decision to have reconstruction so I too, met with (Dr MAHABIR @ Scott & White in Temple TX).  He is fantastic.  He told me I was not a candidate for implants because of the radiation I had.  He said too many problems develop from implants after radiation.  I had the DIEP Tram Flap surgery done at the end of last November.  I am not going to say it was pain free.  I am thankful a husband that helped me so much.  I came home with 4 drains and could not get up and down by myself or even roll over but that didn't last forever.  I was off work 10 weeks.  After 2 1/2 months I went back in to have the nipples made, one breast raised a bit and lyposuction to try and remove some more of the tissue destroyed by radiation.  I went last week to be checked out.  I go back in two months and if all is well I will have the tattoing done to create an areola and color the nipple.  The journey hasn't been without problems such as issues with sutures causing me not to heal correctly but Dr. Mahabir and his staff have been excellent.  He was willing to talk me through my fears and answered all of my questions even if the answer wasn't what I wanted to hear. I am thankful to God for leading me to Scott and White. I also had cancer in the lymph nodes but I chose not to have them removed but to radiate them instead.   A new study had come out to say that it was as effective and since I had trouble previously with swelling I was concerned about developing lymphdema.  I am thankful I don't have that problem.  I have struggled to regain my strength like I would like but I am rejoicing to be alive. I have a lot of incentive.  We are blessed with 15 grandchildren and another one on the way.  My husband and I got married when I was 15 and he was 17.  We have been married 41 years.  We have 4 children who are married to wonderful people sp pur famly has grown to 8 children.  I serve a BIG GOD who is ever faithul! The day I had the ultrasound after the mammogram I heard the words from the radioligists \"The cancer is right here\" changed my world.  As I was getting dressed I asked the Lord to help me handle all of this in a way that would bring glory to HIM!  Hopefully, I have done that. I would strongly suggest Dr MAHABIR @ Scott & White in Temple TX as a plastic surgeon to anyone going through this.  He has done over a 1000.  He has a fantastic team of doctors.  Dr. Woo really stole my heart.  I feel whole again.  I absolutely hated the prostectic breasts.  They were really hot. I didn't like the sunk in look I had without them.  I wanted to look like me again.  I am almost there.   If I am asked to day would I choose this route again I would say YES. I ran across this site by accident.  We do need to share.  You all are in my prayers/  The only thing I would change is I think there should be an opportunity at the beginning for the patient to meet with the team of doctors to give an overview of the whole process.  All along my oncologist seemed to believe that after the chemo and radiation I would be a candidate for implants.  Maybe with some doctors but not with Dr. Mahabir.  He felt it was too dangerous.",
