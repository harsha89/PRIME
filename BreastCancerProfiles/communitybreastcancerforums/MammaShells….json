I had an Aurora Breast MRI, you lay on your belly and your breasts are placed between openings. It was pretty comfortable considering...and it lasted about 25 minutes I think. It is noisy, different bangs and buzzes. I just imagine that I'm laying on my towel at the beach, and the hot construction workers are making a whole lot of noise at the house next door...being all hot and jack-hammery...",

I had a stereotactic biopsy in November of microcalcs, they remove a small bit of tissue with a wide needle and you'll be numbed before the procedure so you shouldn't feel a thing. They won't know anything when they are doing the biopsy, they will be focused on getting the best sample possible to send to pathology to review. The best thing you can do on Friday is to try to be relaxed, make sure you are wearing warm and comfy socks so you don't get a chill. The most uncomfortable part of the biopsy for me was having thin knee-highs on and cold feet, as well as having to lay still with my head to the side. My neck hurt worse than the actual biopsy, it took about 20 mins for them to take 4 samples, and another 10 for an ultrasound guided biopsy.  I had the results within three days. I'm wishing you peace and good results.",

My oncologist made a good point, when she stopped to call my pharmacy personally mid-appt to order the prescription, she asked that I at least try it to know I have been doing all that I can and that if the side effects were unbearable that I could stop at any time knowing that I gave it a shot. She also said that with ADH the benefit can be as much as 85%. So, I'm finally in a place to give it a shot and I plan to start on 4/1 if you would like to join me!",

After a core needle biopsy of microcalcification clusters with diagnosis of ADH I went in for an excisional biopsy and the report came back with LCIS, ALH and ADH in two large (12cm and 8cm) areas that were removed. I haven't found anything regarding risks for women with both LCIS and atypical hyperplasia. I have an appointment next Tuesday to go over the pathology in greater detail and plan to ask this exact question! I will check in with any information I receive.",

The wires weren't bad, I sat at the machine while they guided them in and it went fine. They tape the wires down so that you aren't too uncomfortable and they also give you something before the anesthesia to help relax you. I was surprised at how long it took to recover and expected 24-48 hrs and it was a little longer than that. But, everyone's experience is different.Wishing you all the best!",
