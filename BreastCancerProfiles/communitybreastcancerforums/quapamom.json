      "Content": "quapamom wrote: Well, I had my excisional biopsy/lumpectomy today.  I found my lump at the end of January and went through a baseline mammogram, diagnostic mammogram, ultrasound, ultrasound guided core needle biopsy and finally this.  Pathology from the core needle biopsy showed fibroadenoma and phyllodes tumor.  Excision was recommended to rule confirm diagnosis.  I have to say that the surgery today was a piece of cake compared to my core needle biopsy.  They did the surgery at a surgery center under general anesthesia.  I got all prepped with special stockings and compression things on my calves, IV started, vitals checked.  Met with anesthesiologist and surgeon.  My surgeon said a prayer with me before he went to get ready.  I was given demerol to \"help me relax\" and next thing I knew I woke up in recovery.  They got me a Diet Coke when I was alert.  I got dressed and they called my mom to come get me.  My mom and girls only were gone for about 2 hours, enough time for IHOP and Walmart.  My girls were only upset that they didn't get to come back to the waiting area to get the candy from the vending machine they had scoped out earlier.  I was wheeled out to my waiting car.   No major pain. Mostly a dull ache.  I do have a headache which may be from the general.  I'm taking the pain meds as prescribed.  Been taking one pill, but just took two to try and sleep well tonight and hold off this headache.  I slept most of the day, on and off.  No nausea from the general, but they gave me something to help prevent that.   Funny things I have noticed since coming home:  I brought home my hair net tucked in the back of my bra.  I still had the stickers on my back that they used for the ekg.  (I wondered what my hair kept sticking on.)  My 8 year old daughter says I smell like a hospital.  I think I stink from the betadine?  I can't take a shower till tomorrow with a waterproof dressing.  I'm thinking I'll have to use first aid tape and a plastic bag to make that work.  I can't remove the bandage for 5-6 days.   I just thought I'd post my experience for anyone else going through this.  Now I wait for results.  Hopefully Wednesday will come quickly!   Log in to post a reply",

I'm afraid that I will be manic about SBE's in the next six months espcially as the swelling goes down. ",

Or am I being totally neurotic?  I asked for a copy of the report and she said not until the doc has signed off on it.  Waaah!  I'm worried she didn't tell me everything.  My followup isn't until the 30th.  Ugh! ",
