I had a right breast mastectomy/ lymph node removal and reconstruction with the abdominal flap. It is overwhelming and very scary, but not as bad as I imagined it would be. The first few days after surgery were hard but pain meds help to get you moving. Once you are home you will be feeling much better. I was feeling more like myself after the second week. I am now almost 4 weeks past and I am doing really well. Of coase I am tired and much slower than my normal self, but each day is getting easier. You will get through this. I wish you all a successful recovery.",
