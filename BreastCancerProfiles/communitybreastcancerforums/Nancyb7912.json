Herceptin will be finished this month.  Showed up at the hospital with chest pains in late Feb. Heart is okay but they were surprised to find an enlarged lymph node right next to my heart and difficult to biopsy without surgery. Onco wants to watch it for 6 weeks so my next scan is Tuesday. Waiting is the hardest part. I pray everyone's  tests come back clear. It just feels too soon for us to be dealing with recurrence, though I know it can happen ANY time. Be strong!",
