I'm sorry for the unwelcome news but at least you know what your are up against (and it's out of your body).  My prognosis back in 1994 was over 75% recurrence, extremely high risk... and medical science \"Beat\" that one.  Your case is an individual one, always remember you are not a statistic.  Make sure you feel comfortable with your doctors, you want someone who will fight with you.  YOU CAN DO THIS.... one step at a time.  I'm glad the surgery is over, and the tumor burden is so much less.  Try to get some rest.. the rollercoaster continues... up and down... just remember that it will go up again.  I am sorry you have to go through the down sides.  Feel free to PM me if you'd like. ",
