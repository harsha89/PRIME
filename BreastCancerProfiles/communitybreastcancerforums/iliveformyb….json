They are on top of my liver. My husband is currently deployed. I am in the Fort Drum area and the closest oncologist is 20 min away. However, that oncologist is a small practice and don't even keep online records. The best place for me to go to is Roswell Park in Buffalo but it is close to 4 hrs away. I just want to know if it's doable. How often are the treatments, how tired will i be, can I make the drive myself? Thank you again",

You have every reason to be sad so--Give in. Shed Tears. Be depressed. Embrace fear. Worry about dying. Think about the loved ones you'll be leaving behind. Cry over the life you should have had. Lose hope. Go through all the negative emotions you can possibly think of, but when you're done, please remind yourself that you are strong. Had you not been strong, you would not have lasted 6 years! I read your bio and you have been through a lot--a lot of setbacks. You are strong not because you don't shed tears or go through a slump. You are strong because you let yourself embrace sadness, hopelessness and all these negativity--for a moment, but you manage to pull yourself up and fight again. With our situation what's the alternative? Just as staying positive and fighting to be happy can be tiring, I find it as tiring to be hopeless and depressed. It's always a roller coaster ride with my emotions. I personally will choose to hope and be somewhat happy everyday. If my hope gets crushed one day because I \"lost the battle\" oh well. I'd say I still won. I would choose that over living in fear and sadness everyday and die that way. I know it's easier said than done. You've had your 6 years. I've only been a stage 4 not even 2 months. I'm a rookie compared to you. Please know that women like you are my source of inspiration so please hang in there. I would love to have 6 years or more too...Love and prayers, Kim",

I dislike Xeloda, ---diarrhea, nausea, mouth sores and just blah, but I know I need it. I have quite an extensive liver mets going on. My doctor is still trying to figure out the cocktail to put me in. =) Happy thanksgiving to all!",

Every day, I wake up and it is a battle to be happy. Thank you for your input on seeking treatment from a large center. I am currently receiving treatment in a small one. The big one is 3 and 1/2 hrs away and then of course 3 1/2 hours driving back. So far, just one cycle of Xeloda and Taxotere. I have 5 more to go. It was rough the first week, but it got better. I am handling Xeloda good--for now. My oncologist wants to lower the dose to 5 a day instead of 6 a day next cycle. I am not sure how long the Army will let my husband be with me to help me through the treatment. He eventually has to get back to work, but we will see. A day at a time. overused, but I still can't help but worry. What are your struggles? I am glad you took time to write to me. It gets quite lonely being in our position especially every time I open Facebook. I see people and their peachy lives. =( I know I am a debbie downer today. haha sorry. I saw a story about a liver met girl who's still alive after 10 years...She's treated at MD Anderson though, but there's still hope. I can live with being treated at a small facility as long as it is convenient to people who are taking care of me and it will not take my time away from my kids. I will just leave everything to God, and I will just talk to you and the girls on here and get idea to suggest to my oncologist. It's like having a team of specialist. wink wink",

Yes, I kinda realize that Xeloda by itself, I am toleration well because after the WBC shots, they put me back on Xeloda, and I was fine. Just tired, but none of the nonsense I encountered on the first week of taxotere with Xeloda. the doctor is keeping me on the same regimen but lower dose of Xeloda, 5 pills vs 6. Thanks for your insight again. Wishing you well Woodylb as you continue to provide support to most of us in this forum. xoxo",

I can totally feel that my spirits are getting better---BUT then again it may just be because I am on a 1 week chemo holiday! hahaha I know I was just in a slump a few days back. I am in such good spirits, I feel like a completely different person. I attended a Christian praise group and that really really lifted my spirits up. I am not one of those very religious person. I don't go to church, I don't read the bible. Yesterday, I went just because I don't want to be alone at home while my husband goes to the gym. That may just be one of the best decisions I've made. The power of praise, and knowing that I have nothing to lose if I put my faith in Him. I am not here to preach, so I am not going to start spouting bible verses or lyrics to a Christian song. It worked for me. Yesterday, my husband shaved my head. My hair started looking like Gollums', so we took immediate action and shaved it. I felt so loved. It is not always that you have a husband who is willing to shave your head 2x or willing to fight a cancer battle with you 2x. I am just absolutely thankful for whatever blessings I have right now--even with this horrible terrible disease. Being happy, having a warrior's heart is an ACT of WILL. You have to will it. Lift your spirits, make it whole, and the body will follow suit. I am already making plans of using mind over matter/mind control, when I go through chemo again Tuesday next week. Here is LOVE and POSITIVITY to all my Warrior Buddies. =) Happy Weekend!",
