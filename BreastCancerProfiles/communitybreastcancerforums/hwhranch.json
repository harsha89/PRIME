I said well then you should have no trouble treating it right? Your cancer is very favorable for treatment and the fact that you are hormone receptor positive gives the doctor another avenue of treatment to help. It's easy to get wrapped up in the fear of it all but I'm telling you the best thing you can do is keep moving forward and stay positive because this to shall pass. It will be a bump in the road of your long life!!!!",
