Is anyone doing research studies? What are your thoughts or experiences. I am planning to do Taxol, Avastin and Zometa but am considering doing an additional study drug to these.Â  Thanks for your comments. I am 29, will be 30 in a few weeks and was originally diagnosed at age 26.",

It's based upon if it has spread or reoccurs in order to get it. If you come up for a review which is usally 3-4 years and you are free from disease you will likely be stopped but if it still shows it will not be stopped. wait until you get the final report, then apply. also submit your records with your application it speeds things up. let me know if i can help more.",
