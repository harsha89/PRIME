I was diagnosed back in April and my friend sent me to this site being a BC survivor herself, and I didn't go on it until a week or 2 ago. The women here are so supportive, we have all been through the same terrorizing feeling of a diagnosis, the tremendous fears that we all face as we move into treatment, and the hundreds of questions that race through our minds daily. I too was unable to concentrate, and yet I moved through this one day, sometimes one moment at a time. I kept exercising through the whole thing as best I could to help keep my endorphin's up and my attitude healthy. And yes, I have had some days where I couldn't move from the overwhelm, but you will find a strength inside yourself that keeps you moving forward because you have to. For me this has been a huge wake-up call, I want to learn from it as best I can but I am still scared. My life is more precious to me now, even though it was precious before. I want to focus on the most important things in my life and not sweat the small stuff. And I'm trying to utilize this time in my treatment to get reunited with my personal passions because there is healing in find time and space for those now more than ever. We are here for you, and you are not alone. Sending blessings and hugs!!",
