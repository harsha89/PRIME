The vast majority of my days are normal with the occasional days when I feel more down, fearful and uncertain. Then I remember the things that bring me peace and a sense of control, the most important of which is practicing gratitude and remembering I am a long way off from death. You might find some inspiration from the \"Life does not end with a stage iv diagnosis thread.\" I also suggest you talk with your doctor about having some ativan on hand (I use for sleep occasionally) and or an antidepressant that relieves anxiety such as zoloft or effexor. This whole damn thing is a process; trust that you will find coping strategies that will work well for you. Best to you!",

The visit went well (although even though I had the questions written down I did forget to follow up on one of them) We will do a restaging CT in mid August of the chest, abdomen and pelvis. (the whole staging thing is still a bit of a mystery. My current understanding is that from a medical and statistical perspective I am Stage 1 with metastatic disease so I don't get why they refer to it as restaging.) He likes to use both CT and bone scans and will do a bone scan 4 months after the August CT scan and then scan every 4 months for a while then every 6 months. He is very confident in the letrozole and that is what I neglected to follow up on- what if it fails (I'll email  him.) He's not wanting to do a bisphosphonate at this time due to the SE and given that I don't have any of the rib discomfort I was feeling and with just the one met to the rib. Regarding the cardiac assessment he said \"we don't do that because any cardiac problems arising from the radiation would surface 40-45 years out\"  to which I replied, \"From your lips to god's ear that I should be alive then.\" Even without metastatic disease.

It's a wonderful feeling to be \"known\" in this online community. Ed Services or Special Education are two areas I'm interested in but not in my current district. A big part of my disaffection with my job is the district in which I work. I've never felt that we are a good match and it's just getting less so. I also think of teaching again but would love to do it part time and the district has eliminated tandem assignments. Sorry everyone for for the \"shop talk\" Probably should have pm'd Lisa",

Faslodex is doing the trick for me- no evidence of active disease on scan in September, Now I wonder constantly about what's best for me: work on reconnecting to what is good about my work, taking an early retirement, (just celebrated my 59th BD) going on disability first even though I don't feel disabled other than tiredness and cognition being \"different\" I know I freaked out my spouse and our financial advisor out when I said my job \"is killing me.\" I wasn't even aware of what I had said. There's so much to sort out- Can I afford to retire? Can I afford not to? How long will savings last? What about health coverage? It feels almost more overwhelming than the cancer so thanks again for all the info. I'll be rereading this thread! Peace to all of you ladies! Lisa",

Some people had a poor experience with Kaiser early on but I have been very happy with it. If you have a catastrophic illness it can be a very good place. There was a guy in my support group who needed a specialized type of stem cell transplant. Kaiser doesn't do that and refers out to City of Hope but my friend advocated for the real expertise in the area which was at Stanford. Kaiser paid for my friend's entire cost: lodging and airfare for several consultations, lodging for 6 mos after the transplant and a per diem for a 24 hr caregiver. Jobur, thanks for the Little Prince mention. I am barely managing work and the only reason I can I think is due to amazing support at home and not having children.

Onc left me in room for quite awhile as he wanted to show the scan to someone (I assume another onc) Much to my surprise he comes back in and says we're going to do femara and Ibrance. I was on femara when mets first discovered in 2014 then progressed. We tried Ibrance in 2015 with faslodex but stopped because even at 75 mg my WBC tanked. That was before the liver mets though so now we'll try neupogen to deal with the WBC. I'm adding in flax, green tea and lots of protein. I'm concerned about the low dose of Ibrance and I'm being lazy and ask all of you rather than research myself what the difference is between Neupogen and filgristim. Even if the Ibrance/femara doesn't work I am happy to get whatever break from chemo I can. There is so much activity and support on this thread! I do read some and send positive thoughts to all who are on new protocols or trying to make these tough decisions. Love to all Lisa",

I've been on Taxotere since Sept 2017. It was working well at first- good scans and tumor markers decreasing. The last few months the tumor markers have been rising; the scan in Feb showed \"no convincing evidence of progression\" so he wanted to get a few more treatments in before considering any change I have been with my oncologist since 2007. I like him a lot, and know him to be super smart, very caring and aggressive in approach to treatment. I didn't go along with his aggressive approach when I was first diagnosed but now that I am metastatic I'm in. I think. I met with him yesterday and we are testing the marker again next Monday. If they have gone up he wants to add Xeloda and docetaxol! He knows it may affect my QOL and if so we would stop. He is looking for a complete response like I had with Doxil and Cytoxan. At this point I am somewhat reluctantly agreeing to give it a try. I would so appreciate any input anyone has. One question I have for him is if we do some Xeloda in combo can we use it later as a single agent. Gratefully, Lisa",

I have also heard that some time on chemo can re-sensitize to hormonals; I heard after a year so was so pleased to try it sooner. I'll ask about the ribociclib and why the letrozole rather than faslodex. I progressed on both so is it a timing thing? I was most recently on the faslodex. As far as the triplet trial with the A/A combo goes, I didn't put it in my signature but I briefly tried A/A before the liver mets appeared. We stopped it rather quickly because I broke out in a nasty rash and since I'm still working (not for much longer) I didn't want to scare the kids. Or parents. (I'm an elementary principal). However, I'm certainly willing to give it another try especially since I will be on summer break soon and may not go back to work. The retirement thing is complicated due to health insurance. Thanks again for such great information! Z. on another note I may join your fitbit community because I'm putting on pounds. Did I read in another thread that you do a 12 pose yoga sequence every morning? I do from 10-20 minutes most mornings and I'm curious about your sequence. Best to all Lisa",

I wasn't as upset about the hair loss as I imagined. Can't say why though. Maybe just getting older or having an amazing partner who never wanted me to reconstruct (I never did either) and likes me bald. When my hair really started to shed and thin I had my hairdresser shave it. I have a hand tied wig that is very light and I like it. The only way I don't feel like a cancer patient is when I wear a wig. Forget turbans or scarves they make me feel the worst. I'd love to go out bald but I'm not there yet. For sure I would need to have a closer shave because not all my hair came out and what is left grows a little and I tend to look like the Peanuts character, Linus. On the upside, I needed to pay more attention to my brows and now that I have very little left and have to draw them in they actually look better. I miss my eyelashes a lot though. Thank you all for being you. Even though you may not know it, you give hope and support to women you don't interact with. Wishing all much love and light and good days.",

I know some return to a hormonal and I hope to be able to do that too but for now the chemo has me down.

My MO tends to be aggressive and not so much the QOL sort. I did read on the afinitor/aromasin thread a post from Toronto, a school principal, that she has minimal SE on A/A and works full time. That was encouraging to me because I'm a full time school principal and I'll need to dump the afinitor if I can't work. Doc said I could just take the aromasin. I said I was worried about burning through my treatment options and he indicated we weren't- that there would be new drugs. We didn't stick to this line of conversation. Unfortunately, that's typical of my MO but I still like him. If anyone knows how to change the thread title please let me know. My brain sometimes... ",

As always, it's great to hear others have had similar conversations or questions about treatment decisions. We truly are not at a point yet where we know exactly what is right for each individual cancer but there is hope that we are on the right path with the research. Exbrnxgrl, it's good to connect with you. The end of the school year is a trying time for me . I'm exhausted, there are lots of deadlines and the bittersweet feeling of having made a positive difference and of having fallen short in areas . You were such an early inspiration with your \"Life does not end\" thread. That's a big reason why I have been not as active here. For one, I recently discovered the great professional chats and learning available on Twitter and was at a \"F-cancer\" place so was cyber living in the Twitter-spere for awhile. I'm looking forward to vacation too. I hope you have a smooth year end and a restful/productive summer. Best to all and thanks again for the support. Lisa",

I had a small tumor, stage 1 no node involvement, a mastectomy and a prophylactic rt one. Finished my 5 years of tamoxifen, tumor markers always low even at the time of my new diagnosis. I didn't think recurrence let alone a distant metastais was an issue. Knowledge is power and we all need the reminder to be grateful for each day and enjoy each moment and never become complacent. I was aware of a \"bump\" on my chest wall and it never occured to me it was a recurrance. Sounds insane but maybe not considering the early detection message.",

This is all because my mo changed my medication. He wasn't even saying I had progression, just that my one bone met was more active! That my doc wanted to change my treatment alone was a shock to me. I went from \"I'm-going-to-sail-along-on-AIs-for-15+-years and be one of the 1-2%,\" to I'm going to exhaust my treatment options and die soon. I haven't thought that since the first weeks after diagnosis. The change in my outlook was huge. It also heightened my ambivalence about about my profession and doubts about my abilities so that I am struggling with where to focus. This weekend things are starting to shift though. I started reading a couple of professional books that have helped with my attitude towards work. And I changed my signature to include a different quote that is very meaningful to me and more helpful at this time. I hope that as I deal with this for however long I have I can find ways to cope. I hope the experiences and wisdom the ladies have shared will help you feel better soon and I hope we both stop thinking about our deaths and live fully each day. Thinking of you. ",
