Just had my port placed yesterday and first chemo today. It was kind of a relief to get things underway. I keep going through a mental battle between keeping the long term goal in sight, which of course, is health or mentally kicking and screaming \"I dont want to do this!\". So for you who about to start, try to keep your perspective. This is temporary and it's critical. The doctor just gave me the prescrip for emla cream today. Sure wish I had thought to ask for it ahead of time since my chest was already so sore from the surgery. The nurse sprayed a little numbing gel on the area so it was tolerable, but I'd definitely recommend getting the cream before the first chemo. The first chemo day was uneventful. Was nice to have a friend with me to chat with to help pass the time. I felt slightly light headed while they were giving the anti nausea infusion and again driving home. Not nauseous, just slightly off. I'll go back for Neulasta tomorrow. Fortunately it's a 15 minute drive. No one mentioned treating my eyebrows or nails. I'll have to read back through the threads but if anyone can tell me what works best that would be great. Now I'm just resting and wondering what the next few days will bring. Good luck to everyone.",

After that it got slowly better, but even by day 7 I needed to rest after being out doing errands for just an hour. If the fatigue gets worse with each treatment I'm worried that I wont have any good days between treatments! I'm curious to hear if side effects after the second treatment are similar or worse than the first. Even though I had some nausea and constipation it didn't get too bad before the meds did their job. I had no appetite for a few days, but made sure I ate a little every couple of hours and drinking lots of fluids. The only real surprise has been a yeast infection. A friend suggested starting a probiotic to help with all the digestive issues. Sounds like a good idea. Has anyone tried that?",

For me the day after treatment was pretty good, then some nausea and fatigue started the following day followed by constipation and mild bone pain. As you'll see everyone's a little different though and the degree it effects us can be very different. Definitely keep moving as much as you can, it seems to help. But dont push too hard, you need time to rest too. Hope it goes well for you. Sheila - well said! I always thought I was a pretty compassionate person, but going through this will definitely change my perspective. Rambo - had 2nd infusion on Thursday and had trouble sleeping for 2 nights. Got up to use the bathroom 2-3 times then woke up between 4-5:00 and couldnt go back to sleep. Took Ativan last night and that helped some. Slept till 6:30 today. I got a little lazy too with drinking water, but tried to kick it back up a couple of days before infusion. SE's have actually been a little easier this time for me. The first time I took compazine at the first sign of nausea like they said. It helped but made me very constipated. This time I held off for a few minutes to see if nausea would pass or get worse. Only had to take one compazine so far. Still constipated, but not as bad as last time. Of course if you need the nausea meds take them, not good to be throwing up. But if its mild try holding out for a little before you decide. We're all so different in how this effects us. Feel so badly for those of you suffering with all the nasty SEs. Praying that you'll feel better today. Going tomorrow to get the head shaved. ðŸ˜¥ Got a wig, couple of scarves and a sleep cap. Nurse said its all going to come out anyway since Im on adriamycin so no point cutting it short. Its day 17 and its falling out quickly, not clumps, but shedding all over my clothes. Im afraid to even wash it today. My 15 year old daughter wants to come with me. Sweet of her, but hope its not too traumatic for both of us. Hate that this is such a visual statement that labels me \"cancer patient\". Gotta put on my 'big girl panties' for this one. Still love that quote!",

Tylenol helps some, but it just never completely goes away. Got the head shaved yesterday. It was upsetting, but my daughter was a good support. The problem is my wig makes my headache worse! I've loosened it as far as I can, but can't stand to wear the thing! I don't mind wearing scarves inside the house, but would rather be able to wear the wig when I go out. Don't want to become a hermit, but I didn't even go for my walk yesterday because I didn't want to face the neighbors without a wig. Stupid, I know. Anyone else having vision problems? My dr says its not unusual and should go away after chemo. Hope so. I already use reading glasses and now its worse. Dr said just to get cheap stronger readers, not to have eye exam until chemo is done. HVV - I'm given Emmend, Aloxi and Decadron through the IV before chemo. The first two are for nausea, I think they just work differently, so together they're more effective. Sorry I can't answer your questions. So far, haven't had any swelling. Poconos- glad you went for another opinion. I'm in PA also and went to a top doc at Univ of Pa Hosp for a 3rd opinion when there was some disagreement between my surgeon and MO. I know it's inconvenient, but make sure you're getting the treatment you deserve. Some people have talked about their cases being reviewed by a panel of docs. You might want to ask your doc if he can do that. Maybe someone else on here can chime in if they've done that. Good luck with the surgery and new treatment plan.",

So the first taxol is done and it went smoothly. Long day though 8:30-2:30. No allergic reaction so that was a relief. The nurse said she hasn't seen anyone have a reaction for a long time. The benedryl made me sleepy and a little light headed, also got Decadron, Pepcid and zofran through the IV. Rambo the icing is supposed to help prevent neuropathy in the hands and feet. I brought ice packs and kept them on almost constantly during the taxol drip. The problem was taxol takes 3 hours and my ice packs didnt stay very cold after the first 2 hours. Next time I'll bring more and keep some in a cooler and switch them. Feel ok so far. Just the typical tiredness and brain fog. My dr came in and said \"you're tired aren't you?\" She said my RBC and hemoglobin had dropped significantly after the last AC, but she didnt do a blood transfusion since taxol won't lower it any further. She said we should see it climb back slowly. She also said if I have neuropathy she'll want to know exactly when it starts and how long it lasts. If its just a few days we'll continue as scheduled. If its longer she'll lower the dose. I think I'm feeling just slight tingling in my fingers and toes or maybe its my imagination since I'm so aware of it! That's how my mind works. She also said to start with advil if i have any bone or muscle pain but gave me a prescription for oxycodone just in case I need something stronger over the weekend. I don't like just sitting here waiting to see how this effects me, but I don't have the energy to do much else. Gonna try to get myself out for a very short walk now. I'm thinking of all of you in your various phases of treatment. Especially Angela, Hannarigs and Cherri3 since we just started together. Keep me updated and I'll try to do the same. Angela I hope this gets easier for you! Twohobbies - I hate that you're getting conflicting info! This is so hard without the added stress. I just want to shake these doctors when they do that to us!

I'm 52 and I'm getting taxol every 2 weeks. I was told last week that we may have to postpone the next treatment if my counts dont come up. There's nothing I can do but wait for the next blood work. This whole thing is an emotional roller coaster. At least I know ahead of time that there might be a delay and I've been in treatment longer so I've had more time to process all of this. It sounds like this is all too new and overrwhelming for her right now. Please dont be offended at this suggestion, but many of us have also needed some Ativan or something especially at the beginning while we're learning how to cope with it all and at night when the fear tends to creep in. Momx2 had a good idea to post your message on the weekly taxol forum. Others may chime in here, but you might increase your chances of finding someone close to her age and on the same regimine there.

Still have a little neuropathy, but not too bad. Have tiny white patches of fuzz on my head. Sounds like others have started the same way so I hope it gets darker! One week after the last tx my son fainted at school, hit his head and got a concussion. I've been busy taking him to appointments, working with the school and trying to keep him sane. Its tough on an 11 year old who is not supposed to do anything physical and cant watch tv or use any technology. He cant read, go to school or do homework without getting a headache. Its been an unwelcome distraction, but at least I'm focused on something other than cancer for awhile. Although my focus is almost as bad as his! Really need this chemo brain to go away and for his brain to heal so we can find a little 'normal' again. Im thinking of all of you still in tx or who just finished. Hope those doing rads are tolerating that well. Be diligent using the creams they give you to keep the area moisturized! It helps. Hannarigs, I'm worried about you and sending you hugs.

You're right that this is not over for us and people just dont get that. But its a huge accomplishment that we got through this nasty step and we're still fighting.

Hope they advised you to use a good lotion (mine said aquafor) a couple times a day on the radiated area. It does help alot. I had one area that got rashy/itchy and hydrocortisone helped that. Theres also a prescription cream called silvadeen (i think) which can help if the redness becomes uncomfortable. I needed this around the nipple because the skin got so red and tender. Good luck. Good news is I was able to get the blood work done yesterday for the genetic testing. Now 4-6 weeks of waiting. I shouldve done it earlier but was procrastinating.

Cherri- What a great mom for crawling around with your baby when you're exhausted and feel like hell. Amazing what we can do for our kids. Mellie - i had a different onc last tx while mine was sick.

First treatment was yesterday and I'm still feeling fine. Just a little tired yesterday but ate well, drank lots and rinsed my mouth with baking soda and water every time I went to the bathroom. Taking claritin for the neulasta shot and had an ativan to help me sleep. The steroid had me a little wired, but the ativan helped. So far I feel good this morning. I'm not working, just driving my kids and trying to get my daughter off to overnight camp. Rambo50 I'll let know how I feel by the end of the day. I get my shot at 1:00. My nurse if I have bone pain it doesn't usually start until 24 hours after the shot and can last up to 5 days. Yuck! But it sounds like you might be able to work the day after chemo. See what the others say and have a back up plan if you're too tired or nauseous. Dxat32 - I'm sorry you have the added stress of your schedule. This is never convenient is it? I didnt have the same surgery, but my doctor was very helpful in working with me on the start date. They helped me get an echo scheduled quickly, (which I don't know if you need). Just tell the doc everything you're worried about and ask how they can help you move quickly. I wouldn't skip the training session. For me it was just 45 minutes with the nurse, but it was helpful. And you can ask to do it early while you're waiting for your start date. Try to take a deep breath and keep your head up until you can work out the schedule on Monday. Waiting stinks. Good luck",

Mine spent about 45 minutes with me 2 days before my first treatment. They gave me the prescriptions I needed, went over side effects, when to call them, gave me a tour, etc. It was very helpful. If yours haven't done that you might want to call and ask. There were just 3 important scripts for me - 2 were for anti nausea meds and 1 (which they didn't give me, but I wish they had) was for Emla cream to numb the skin before they accessed the port. They also told me what meds to have for constipation, which can be severe during chemo, and what pain relievers I could use. These may vary depending on what chemo drugs they're using so make sure you find out. I also needed Claritin to take before the Neulasta shot as others have mentioned and yes, it worked - no bone pain. As far as the day of chemo you don't really need much. A friend to keep you company is nice, maybe a snack, iPad, magazines, etc. My cancer center really pampers us and provides lunch and a even a free foot massage! The nurses talked to me every step and kept me comfortable. It was really an easy day, just try to be mentally strong and keep it in perspective. Chemo stinks, but its all temporary! We'll adjust to the hair loss. I've learned to joke about it with my 11 year old son. But I'm sure when it actually starts, probably next weekend, its going to be tough. Once I was home, I used a little basket to keep all of my meds and a journal to keep track of when I took them, side effects each day, questions that come up, etc. I also kept some whole wheat crackers, dried fruit, mints and tissues. It's also good to have some easy foods on hand which are a little bland, but high in fiber and protein. Smoothies are great because you can cram so much in them. I keep some berries in the freezer then blend them with yogurt, a little spinach or kale and some sunflower seeds. Then if you don't have much appetite you can still get a lot of what you need from one glass. there were a coiple of days when i had no appetite but made myself eat a little every couple hors. Some plain cooked chicken, chicken soup, crackers, pears and dried fruit were my basics. I like having a few alternatives to water too since we're all told to drink lots - my favs were Gatorade for the electrolytes, green tea steeped with a slice of ginger for nausea, and cranberry juice for urinary tract infection. You've probably read all of this elsewhere already, but its kind of therapeutic for me to write it and maybe something will be helpful. Try to spend time this week enjoying things that you like to do, not just running errands that you're worried about! You'll still have goods days so don't think you won't be able to accomplish anything for the next few months! You can do it and we're here for you when you need us!",

I'm going to call my hairdresser to see when she can do it. What bothers me the most is that I wish my sister was here to go with me, but she lives 10 hours away.

I will pray for you today too that you're going to stop this cancer and have many, many years with your little ones. Jerigrace - if the meds aren't handling the SE's call! It doesn't hurt to ask a nurse for advice. Thats what they're there for. I remember the dr saying that sometimes alleve works better for bone pain, but it can cause an upset stomach. It could be different for you depending on the chemo drugs you've had so ask first. I would call before the weekend if you're still in pain tomorrow. I have had pain across my cheekbones and in my jaw, but I was fortunate that it wasnt too bad. They told me its often there, in the sternum and the lower back so I think its a normal SE with Neulasta. Jnprsn - day 4 was the worst for me after the 1st treatment. I was thinking \"I can't do this for 4 months!!\" But days 5-7 were a little better and by day 8 I felt mostly normal. But, like I just said, if the meds aren't doing enough I would call and talk to a nurse before the weekend. Hang in there. Hope you're better soon. Bluestars- same with constipation. At least now you know how your body is going to react so talk to the nurse or dr about how you can prevent it. Sometimes a little coffee in the morning helps me, plus all the usual advice.. prunes, tons of water and go for a walk if you can. Some of the others may have better ideas. Sorry you've been suffering! Rambo - you're so brave. I'm sorry for everything you're dealing with. I need to schedule a consult for genetic testing and have been putting it off.

To stay off the Internet until I had all of the information about my diagnosis and treatment plan. And then, only go to sites that she recommended. 2. Fill the prescription for the anxiety medication and use it, especially at night when your brain won't shut down. There's so much overwhelming information and much of it is scary. You and your hubby need to be able to focus on what applies to you. I even got overwhelmed on this site the first few times I looked through it. You sound like a very strong woman. All of us go through some degree of anxiety. It's impossible not to. Kayaking gently on quiet water sounds so wonderful. I think many of us would be right there with you if we were nearby! And even though there have been some days when I might not be up for it, most days I think I could. Exercise will be good for you, but make sure you talk to your doctor about it. Regarding the port, I also had 'twilight' anesthesia. I wasn't fully asleep, but far enough out to not care what they were doing and no pain at all. It was sore for a few days afterward and I couldn't sleep on that side for quite awhile, but it feels fine now. I wish the best for you. Keep us updated with how you're doing. You'll be in my prayers.",

( my autocorrect keeps changing that to jerk grace so forgive me in advance if I don't change it one day!) I called and talked to a chemo nurse yesterday about my headaches. She was going to get a script for something stronger, but I told her no. Stronger pain relievers effect me weirdly and I don't want another SE. I asked if they had any other suggestions. She thought that I might be dehydrated since I'm also constipated, although thats getting better. I've been drinking 2 quarts a day - that's what they had suggested. Reading daisy's description of dehydration makes me think, no that's not what I'm feeling. Maybe it's just a matter of degrees of dehydration. Nurse said to increase fluids anyway and try just switching to a different pain reliever like Advil. Did that and 1/2 an hour later no headache! I do think that my vision problems can bring on the headaches, so trying to limit my time on here and taking breaks when my eyes get tired. Regarding radiation, I did my 6 weeks already. My doctor originally thought there was a mistake in my pathology report. Triple negative didn't add up with the all the other data and she didnt think I would need chemo. While we were waiting for new path report (which ended up confirming TN) she had me start radiation since she said I would definitely need that anyway. They said radiation would reduce the risk of it returning to that breast. Chemo reduces risk of it recurring elsewhere. Like someone else said, rads may not be necessary though if you've had a mastectomy. Radiation was not too bad for me. If I could have stopped there I would have been happy. But no, here we are. A least I feel more confident that I'm doing everything possible. I'll be glad to answer other questions about the rad process and SE's if anyone wants more info. Keep your spirits up girls! I'm not wasting another beautiful PA day sitting inside because of my shaved head and headaches! If the wig hurts again today I'm ditching it for a scarf and everyone else will have to get used to it. Time to get over being so sensitive to what they think!",

If it is a sinus headache what has helped? Advil helps some, but they never completely go away. Daisy, I'm so glad for the attitude of your dr! He's so right that we have to take this opportunity to fight it hard, especially because of your age. And asking you what he needed to do to get you through it was the perfect question. And good for you for saying what you need.! So glad it's helping. For anyone dreading round 2, I hope it encourages you to know that for me it was slightly better than the first. The hardest part for me was losing my hair and now the headaches. Im so grateful that I haven't had more serious issues and Ive been thinking of all of you who've had it worse. A friend told me she felt like there was something a little different that came up with each treatment. But she learned from each one and was better prepared for the next.

She was expecting a slow gradual increase since taxol isnt supposed to effect this like AC. I wasnt surprised because my fatigue has been horrible. She ordered an iron study which will take a couple of days I guess and then may do an iron infusion. She said I'm almost at the level of needing a blood transfusion which I'd rather avoid. Hoping we can get these counts up so I can function a little better. Shes worried that Im going to faint and fall down the steps or something. I am too. We talked about the bone and muscle aches and I asked if I could skip the neulasta to see if that would reduce the aches. She agreed to let me try it since wbc are in the normal range. The risk is that if it falls too much I might have to delay the next chemo. Not sure if I made the right decision to forego the neulasta. Im second guessing myself now. But its so hard to deal with pain when I'm sooo tired. Once the fatigue is better I think I could deal with the pain if I have to have neulasta next time. But I'd also rather not delay treatment or end up getting sick. I also asked about getting a half dose and my dr refused. She said its a preloaded syringe and they will only give all or nothing. Any advice about whether I should or shouldn't try skipping the neulasta? Dr also said its normal for the pain to pop up in different places with taxol. She looked at the little bumps on my back and thinks its just irritated from the skin being so dry. Hard to get moisturizer on the center of your back so now thats my DH's job. I actually had radiation right after my lumpectomy so then had to delay chemo until my skin healed. Long story, but the bs initially didnt think the path report was right, didnt believe I could be triple negative, and didnt think I would need chemo. So while we were waiting for new path report and an appointment for second opinion we started rads. At least thats done, but now that I know more I wish we had started chemo earlier. Angela my radiation was on the left breast too and no one mentioned proton rads. I was so overwhelmed at the time and I didnt know enough to ask about it. They did take great care with the mapping of the breast to avoid the heart, but who knows? Whats done is done now though. Cherri- my dr said my headaches now are from low hemoglobbin. I get kind of a pulsing throbbing headache sometimes. May not be the same for you, just thought I'd mention to describe the kind of headache that you get to the dr and check your bloodwork so it might help determine the cause.

I just called the cancer center to check on the iron and b12 blood work they did last week. The doctor said its fine! Thats not what i wanted to hear. I would much prefer to do an iron infusion than a blood transfusion. She said my options are to wait for it to improve or do the blood transfusion. The nurse tried to reassure me that its much safer than it used to be and that it would definitely make me feel better. I'm not sure that I'm buying it. Any thoughts? Should I just deal with this and wait for the counts come up on their own or take the relief and the risk?",

My doc wanted me to write down what day it starts and what day it goes away (if it goes away) before the next tx. She also asks alot of questions about whether I'm able to fasten buttons and things like that. The severity and how long it lasts will determine whether its worth cutting back or not. After 3 dd taxol mine has only gotten slightly worse. So dont assume it will be worse each time. I would call the chemo line if you're worried. Thanks everyone for understanding my anxiety. I think my grumpiness may also be due to being thrown into menopause and being depressed from having so few 'good' days. You're right nocompromises, that sometimes we just have to go through the emotions before we can be ready for a more positive outlook. I just wish I could say that this will all be over in two weeks with my last tx, but I know its not that simple. I'm sure I'll be glad to be done with chemo even though I wont feel it for awhile. I need to talk with my mo about what follow ups we'll be doing other than mammograms. I've already had radiation so i'm afraid we're just going to just be waiting to see what happens. As you all get closer to your last tx I'd be curious to hear what your follow up schedule will be... Blood work, mammograms, other scans?? 2bluestars - if your doc says its safe to wait until after thanksgiving then by all means enjoy the holiday. You need that to look forward to and the little break will let you gain strength for surgery. Take care girls. Praying for you all.",

I had radiation on the left breast and I remember him telling me there is an increased risk, but it still seemed low if you did not have other risk factors. I just can't find the number he told me. What was the risk you were told for heart attack in 10 years? After chemo and rads it seems like the heart should be checked periodically. I hope you're able to do the proton radiation. Ktle- so glad you're done with chemo. Hope this last one is easy on you and that you're over the cold. When I first got diagnosed I wanted to do the least amount possible. Now that I know more my perspective has changed. I'd rather treat this aggressively now to reduce the chance of ever having to go through treatment again. Radiation was relatively easy for me compared to chemo. I would strongly say if it reduces your risk then do it! I havent started tamoxefin yet, but would say the same for that too. Hannarigs - sorry that you're having such a hard time. I was thankful that I made it all the way through without having to make changes so I can't answer your question. I hope things improve for you soon. Still dealing with the taxol aches and fatigue from tx last week. So glad I dont have to go back. I've also had an emotional couple of days. A mom at my kids school has been battling a rare cancer that started in her sternum 3 years ago. She's been through hell and now she's out of treatment options. She's in her 40's and shouldnt have to be facing this. Then today I got a message from a friend asking for some advice for her friend's daughter who was just diagnosed with bc. She just moved out of state with her 12 year old daughter and doesnt have anyone around her for support. I cant imagine going through this without my husband and friends. My heart is so heavy for both of them it's hard not to get depressed. I'm with the rest of you who can't wait for this month to be over. I'd really like to be able to watch tv without being reminded of breast cancer. Trying to remember it may prompt others to schedule their mams. Hope the rest of you are feeling well and still fighting hard!",

Praying for health for each of you this year and strength for those of you still having rads or surgery. It's been almost 3 months since my last chemo. That sure went faster than the time during tx! Â My energy is almost normal now, but I still feel so stiff and achy all the time. Really need to get into an exercise class. I can also relate to the lack of sex drive, dryness, ugly duckling feelings, etc, that some of you mentioned. Its reassuring to hear this from others. I'm always wondering if its from the chemo, tamoxifen or being thrown into menopause. Probably all of the above. My hair is only about 1/2 inch long, but is growing and getting thicker. I was hoping to get rid of the wig soon, but theres no way. I WISH I looked like Jamie lee Curtis. No such luck. Â And I just noticed the fine peach fuzz all over my face too! I'm wondering if its because of taking biotin. Anyone else have this who does NOT take biotin? Â I might have to try the nono too. I have a couple of appointments coming up that are on my mind all the time... Mammogram next week and colonoscopy on 2/4. Colon cancer runs on both sides of my family so thats a concern. And this will be the first mamm since finishing tx. I hope to be able to rest a little easier once these arent hanging over my head. The nurse practitioner already warned me not to be surprised if they call me back since scar tissue from rads can make it hard to read. My boobs were always small, but now it'll be like squishing raisins. Ugh. I don't know how they'll be able to see anything. Hannarigs - so happy that you are able to volunteer at the cancer center! Â You have a great way of using humor, but also being sensitive. You'll be great.",

We're here for you and I hope that helps you as much as it has helped me. Congrats Angela! So sweet that the nurses celebrated with you. Tomorrow is my last tx. July 11th - Oct 17th has seemed like a lifetime! Going to go make some apple bread for the nurses and patients to celebrate. I have lots of questions for the dr about what we do next, when can I get this stupid port out and how long its going to take to get some energy back! Even on my best days I can't make it all the way through the grocery store without feeling like I'm going to faint. I went to the look good, feel better program yesterday. Almost cancelled at the last minute because I was so tired, but I'm glad I went. The free make up is good quality stuff! Mostly Elizabeth Arden - their under eye concealer is magic. Get there if you can. Gma - the program will help if you're feeling \"dumpy\". I dont have an answer on the Brian Josephs but I think I remember seeing a thread on here about brows and lashes. You might find an answer there. I have heard of people continuing to lose them a month or more after stopping tx so you'll probably need to continue for awhile. I'll be thinking of all of you tomorrow because you've helped me get through this as much as anyone else!",

Didn't really work though. When you're living with it constantly its hard to get away from. You were all on my mind anyway so I thought I may as well try to read up. I had my 3 round of AC yesterday. Went well. Just felt a little light headed and groggy by the time I left. Doc said my WBC are good, but reds are a little low so expect to feel more fatigue. ðŸ˜’ At least she didnt have to reduce the dose. I want to kick these buggers as hard as we can! Didn't sleep much at all last night. Ativan just doesn't cut it the first night after chemo. HVV - my mo gave me a prescription for Protorix 40mg for reflux yesterday. I was only taking Pepcid when I felt I needed it because it wasn't bad all the time. My mo said I should be taking something everyday to prevent it. Since I already have the pepcid I may try taking it everyday before I fill the script. Good luck. Angela - my mo said to wait on the eye appointment because the vision problems usually go away after chemo. She said not to spend alot on new glasses, just use cheap readers. Problem is the bluriness is not just during reading. Your eye dr may have some ideas to help tho. I'll be curios to know. Was able to go to the beach with my docs approval last weekend. Stayed under an umbrella AND had on 50 sunscreen for the sun glare and for when we were walking around. My skin was fine. Marsha do be careful, but enjoy. It was good for my mental health. Speaking of wigs, a nurse told me a funny story from another patient. She wore her wig to the grocery store then ripped it off as soon as she got back in the car and put on a hat. She then decided to make a quick stop at the drug store so she left the wig on the seat and went in with her hat. A woman walking by saw the wig on the seat and thought it was a dog that had passed out from the heat! No windows were cracked open and she was very worried. She stayed by the car for a few minutes and was about to call the police. Fortunatley the patient came back to the car and the woman immediately realized her mistake and started to walk away. But the woman in the hat asked her if there was a problem. The embarrassed woman owned up to her mistake and they both laughed. I rip my wig off in the car all the time, so this cracked me up. Going to start putting it in a bag so no one calls the police on my unconscious dog! My biggest fear is that it will blow off at one of my sons soccer games and scurry across the field like a rat in the grass. I have visions of everyone screaming over the huge rat AND my bald head. Guess a hat's a better idea for soccer. So nice that some of you feel pretty in your scarves. I'm not there yet.",

I'm feeling so depressed and stressed out this week. Dreading tomorrow. Everyone keeps saying \"yeah, you're halfway through\". But I'm thinking easy for you to say. I still have to go through the next week feeling lousy while my kids are starting school and theres so much going on. Plus 2 more months of who knows what with taxol. Sorry for being such a downer, but this is the only place I feel I can vent. My birthday was yesterday and I spent all day grocery shopping, getting school supplies, filling out school forms, all the stuff I won't feeling like doing after Thursday. Kind of felt like the kids were more caught up in shopping for themselves and not much thought of their depressed, discouraged mom on her birthday. Plus my sons opthamologist (who was very rude) is recommending that we do a more aggressive schedule of eye drops and patching to strengthen his weak eye. We've been doing this treatment for a long time with some success, but the dr says we have to increase it to a daily schedule. I've been so stressed out worried about how he can function at school if we do this. Taking him for a second opinion in a couple of weeks. I hurt my moms feelings on the phone when she was just telling me how many people are praying for me. Which I appreciate and believe in, but it just felt like she wasnt hearing how I was feeling. ThenI felt so guilty for upsetting her and thought of momx2 who would give anything to have her mom with her right now. Plus our air conditioner is broken. There! I put it all out there. I know I need to stop feeling sorry for myself and pull myself together. All the others things in our lives don't stop just because we have cancer do they? I usually have a more positive attitude, but this is all beating me down. It's good to know you all understand.",

I think its fine to respond so people aren't misled into thinking that it wont happen to them if they follow these simple rules. Its just not so. Just provide information in the right tone so people will take it seriously and not shrug it off and think its just you having an issue with it. Grace - sorry to hear how hard the past week has been for you. I hope you're home and doing better. Definitely talk with your dr about your options. Cutting the dose has to be better than stopping completely. Hang in there. Girlstrong - what is your schedule now for taxol & herceptin? I haven't heard of doing taxol as an injection I thought it was always an infusion. I know it's so hard to continue, but our best chance to knock these cells out permanently is to force ourselves to do the full treatment. Switching drugs is kind of scary, like starting all over again and not knowing what to expect. For some taxol is easier so give it time and just keep going. For me the fatigue has been the worst part, but thats because my rbc's took such a hit with AC and haven't come up at all on taxol. I've had bone and muscle aches and some nights I've needed a pain killer to get to sleep, but I've been able to tolerate it with just advil during the day. I've had some neuropathy, but not too bad. Shary - from what I've heard I think taxotere is very similar to taxol so you can see my message to girlstrong. Its seemed like with AC there were so many different side effects..nausea, mouth sores, constipation, loss of appetite, headaches, etc. With taxol those went away almost completely, but were replaced with achiness and neuropathy and of course the fatigue that I mentioned. I hope taxotere will be easy on you. Anyone on taxotere have a better response? Hannarigs - you almost made me cry! You could have sat through your tx focused on yourself and you would have had every right to do that. But you looked around and were touched by other peoples needs. I love that you found simple, but effective ways to help and encourage them. Bless you for your caring heart and helping hands! Wish I could hug you. Angela - I'm so glad tomorrow is your last tx.

Not enough to feel a difference yet, but at least they're starting to climb. We talked about follow up plans. I'll see my mo in 4-6 weeks, then see her every 3-4 months for 2 years. Then every 6 months. I'll have a mammogram in January. Since I had radiation before chemo we have to wait 6 months from the end of radiation to do the mam. Then I'll have mams every 6 months on the affected breast and once a year on opposite side. No other scans unless there are symptoms. I asked when I can have the port removed she said to wait until my blood counts are normal then I can do it anytime. She said some people choose to wait a couple of years to remove it in case there is a reccurence. I don't like that attitude and don't want this alien in me for that long! I hope to get it out after my next appt. She said most people start to see hair growth by 4-6 weeks even though it will be very thin and fine. Sue - please let me know how tamoxifen effects you. I was surprised yesterday to hear that my mo wants me to start tamoxifen too. Even though I'm considered triple negative, my pathology was 5% positive for estrogen. It was so low that they treat me as triple negative, but my mo said as long as there is a small amount of growth due to estrogen I could get some benefit from tamoxifen. Ugh. I thought I was done with drugs. Now I need to read up on tamoxifen risks and side effects. She said we can wait to talk about it more at the 5 week visit and start it after that. But I need to see if the risks outweigh the benefits. The mo also explained their survivorship program to me. Its not a support group although thats available if you want it. It's actually follow up with a nurse practitioner who will spend a couple of hours with me making a 'care plan' and 'treatment summary'. She's supposed to talk about symptoms to watch for, make a plan for other doctor visits, communicate with my primary, talk about other screenings, preventative care, ongoing symptoms, and lots of other stuff. It sounds worthwhile and I hope it will make me feel like I'm not on my own waiting for problems. Just thought I'd mention it in case anyone wants to ask if your cancer center does anything like this. It sounds like a new program for mine. The steroid effected me more than usual this time. Only got about 1 1/2 hour sleep even after taking benedryl. Hope I can settle down for a nap today. Hope you're feeling that determination to keep pushing through this! Stay strong girls.",

Angelanature- I almost cried when I read your hair dream. Glad you feel better with the side pony tail fakeout. Great idea. Keep your fiery red spirit! Twohobbies - thanks for all the info/advice on sinus headaches. It does feel a little better when I press on the bone above my eyes. I'll talk to the mo about sinus meds. Nocompromises- I just did a web search on clarinase. Looks like it might be the same thing as Claritin D. Do you know? So impressed that you can give yourself that shot! Bluestars - so excited that you get to see this nasty chemo stuff having a positive effect! Excellent news. LanaM- my name is Lana too! I keep going by lark to avoid confusion or you can call me the \"the other Lana\" Fyi all - I just heard on the news that the stomach bug that's going around in several states has been linked to a bagged lettuce. Be careful. We don't need that right now! Wig stuff - I look like Moe from the 3 Stooges. ok, maybe not that bad, but theres too much hair in the front and I hate it. My hairdresser is on vacation so I'm trying to wait until she gets back to see if she can help. Or I might try the tlc site. Definitely self conscious when I wear it. Someone said to me on a rainy day \"oh your new hairdo looks so perfect! Mine is so frizzy in the rain.\" Uugh. Can't wait for my frizzy, not so perfect hair to grow back. People like to remind me that it may grow back with more grey and curly. Not sure why they think I need to hear that right now! Hope everyone can enjoy the weekend. Hugs to everyone.",

Counts are on the low side, but no transfusion and no reduction in the dosage. guess I should be thankful that we were able to do dose dense AC full force all 4 rounds! Feel ok so far, just the brain fog and up at 3am. I asked questions about Taxol. She said there's less nausea, usually a little less constipation, and gradually the fatigue improves. That part sounds good. Have to wait to see what happens with allergic reaction and bone pain. She says statistics are low and if there is pain it usually subsides in a couple of days. She agreed it can't hurt to bring bags of ice for my fingers and toes to help prevent neuropathy. Realitycheck - I think it depends on HOW low the counts get. I forgot to pick up a copy of my blood work and don't remember my numbers from yesterday. (Chemo brain ðŸ˜Ÿ) The dr has often said that one thing or another is low, but still in a safe range. So we've been able to keep on schedule. It doesnt necessarily mean that you'll have a delay. Good luck, try to rest and eat well, have lots of protein, give your body every advantage you can. Thanks to everyone for your understanding and encouragement on my last post. As I was leaving for treatment yesterday morning I threw in a pack of thank you notes to work on while I was waiting. I think writing all those cards helped me change my perspective to being thankful for all the little things people have been doing. Then a friend showed up to sit with me for a couple of hours and got me laughing. Love her. As far as the kids go, yeah they were pretty selfish on my birthday, but they've done a lot to try to support me and I don't want one bad day to overshadow that. You'll love this... My DH was having a hard time picking out a birthday present for me this year. I happened to mention earlier in the week that we needed to replace our grill brush. Yep, you guessed it. He wrapped up a grill brush for my birthday. I didn't even know what to say. To his credit he did have some other gifts too (including chocolate) but he must have been really desperate to give me a grill brush! Angela - thanks for the info on amblyopia. When my son was 5 we discovered the vision in his left eye was 20/200. He's 11 now and in April it had improved to 20/40! We were so happy with the progress. It was all through various schedules of patching and eye drops and has been very difficult. The dr never talked about the glasses you described. During the summer we let up on the treatment (a few other things going on in our lives, ya know!) and he regressed to 20/60. So know we've wasted the summer and I feel mommy guilt for not pushing him more. I am definitely going to talk to the new dr about what other methods we can try that will not effect him so much at school. Our dr has said that our window of opportunity is closing because of his age and that's why we need to be more aggressive. Hoping the new dr has a more manageable plan. Soryla - I never responded to your question about underarm odor. Boy has mine changed. I tried changing deodorant, but it hasn't helped. Ive started washing my pits a couple of times during the day and reapply deodorant. Helps some, and I keep wipes in the car in case I need them. Ugh. Hope this goes away. Hormonal changes maybe or simply nasty toxins escaping. Glad I dont have the \"chemo gas\" with this or my family wouldn't be able to live with me! Im starting to think I'm being thrown head first into menopause. Hadn't really started that before chemo, but i know chemo can bring it on. Im waking up alot at night hot (not sweaty yet, just hot) plus all the emotional turmoil I've been in this week I'm wondering if this is the beginning. Sorry for such a long post. Thinking of you all and hoping you're managing the SE's well. Love the support you all give to me and each other. Keep it up!",

I hardly ever took even a Tylenol before all of this started. I find myself gagging whenever I have to take all these pills. But I have learned that i have to take meds sometimes to help my body get through this. If you need to take something for nausea or a Pepcid for indigestion - just do it. It will be harder on your body if you start vomiting or can't eat. Some of our side effects, like constipation, can get SO MUCH WORSE if we don't take the pills so don't avoid the meds. Some people have said that sinus meds have helped with the headaches. Not sure if you're getting cytoxan, but that can effect the sinuses. And remember that you ARE doing the right thing to get treatment. So now use your defiant powers for good and fight hard girl! Feel free to vent here whenever you like. It's kind of therapeutic. I'll be praying for you and hope you have someone to help you with everything. So glad to see the progress we're all making. Many of us are halfway through! My first Taxol starts tomorrow and I'm scared. My mo and the nurses make it sound like its unusual to have severe pain. I sure hope they're right.",

I've been feeling stressed and frustrated and I needed the attitude adjustment. I know you're right. One of the biggest things I'm thankful for is the timing of all of this. I know that sounds weird, but a year and a half ago I had to take my daughter out of school for 3 months to deal with an eating disorder. She was in counseling 4 days a week with constant supervision at home, and I do mean constant. She slept in our bedroom, I was in the same room with her all day, stood outside the door when she went to the bathroom, monitored every meal, had to work with the school to get assignments, it consumed all of my time and energy. There is no way that I could have done this and dealt with the stress of all of it at the same time as going through my own treatment. Now, she's so much stronger physically and mentally. She's taking honors classes at school and playing Varsity field hockey. For a teenage girl who was so focused on herself for so long it's been amazing to see her become more sensitive and supportive. She's even started a little project of making hair bows, selling them to her friends and donating the money to Susan G Komen. I know that we will both be stronger and hopefully more sensitive to other people because of what we've been through. Angela - glad your pain is manageable. I'm curious about how they cut your Neulasta in half. Before i even started AC i asked if they could just give me a smaller dose and monitor my wbc. I was told they can't give half a shot. My WBC was only 6.3 so I'm not sure if they would do that anyway, but I'd like to try if its high enough next time. I'm doing better, thanks for asking. Mostly tired, from low rbc and hemoglobin and not sleeping well. Hannarigs - I'm glad you can finish everything this year! I hope everything stays on schedule and that radiation will be easy for you. Marsha - my moving pain has stopped. Just some occasional achiness. I think it was just the taxol pain, but I'll talk to the doc about it next week. Good for you for telling work what your needs are instead of trying to do everything. I hope they will be cooperative. Jerigrace - ugh, go take a nap! I've had so much trouble sleeping this time even after taking benedryl the past 2 nights. Hope you can get caught up. Two hobbies - love your warrior image. Can I have long flowing brunette hair? I'm afraid it's going to come back grey and curly. Sorry this is so long and that i didnt include everyone. I'm thinking of you all and hope you're feeling like the warriors that you are.",

My mo says it's normal, but that doesnt make it any better! Yours sound more severe. I can usually just take pain meds at night. Mine usually last just a couple of days then gradually get better. Hope you feel better quickly. Ive been absent for awhile too, but theres a lot going on. Had #3 out of 4 taxol on Thursday. My blood counts were still very low and yesterday I had a fever that would vary between 100.2-100.8. Im supposed to call if its 100.4 but I didnt. Was afraid the on call doc would tell me to go to the hospital and I'd rather wait to see my own doc. So far no fever this morning but I'll keep an eye on it. I was wondering if my temperature goes up because of hot flashes or if its really a sign of infection. Talked to a genetic counselor when I was there on Thursday. . My insurance is supposed to cover the testing since i'm triple negative and under 60. We havent done the blood work yet, she didnt come back in time when i was there for chemo so now i'm waiting for her to call and schedule it. More anxiety and waiting. I tried to follow the triple negative forum on here but it was too depressing and was just upsetting me. I've been getting angry at people who say 'yippee, only one more to go!' I dont know what to say that doesnt make me sound like i'm just being negative or feeling sorry for myself. But really, would they celebrate going for a root canal? And is this really over after the last treatment? NO!! The anxiety of every follow up is going to drive me batty. I dont even want to ring that **** bell! Maybe I'll be ready to celebrate when I start to look and feel like myself again. I was venting some of this to my favorite nurse last week. She said its pretty common for women near the end of treatment to feel more anxious about reccurence. Im trying not to let my mind go there, but its hard not to. She suggested a survivorship program through Living Beyond Breast Cancer. I dont know yet if I'll do it. I just want some time off from all of this. Anyone else know about survivorship programs? Sorry this is so long. Hang in there sisters.",

I think I really need some yoga classes to get these muscles stretched out. Glad you can be with your kiddos for thanksgiving! Nocompromises - glad you're doing well on T. I still get hot flashes that started during chemo too. Not too bad, but annoying when it wakes me up at night. I lost weight on chemo and dont really need to lose any more. Will have to watch out for that if I decide to take it. Thanks",
