I have just discovered this thread.   I am meeting with my surgeon this Thursday.  I will be finishing chemo on June 22.  When I met with the surgeon in Feb he mentioned that I may be a candidate for MX with immediate recon.   Trigeek - you mention your friend was going into the hospital for this and I am wondering how she is doing.  Mine will be right side only.   My thought at the moment is that if I have the MX then immediate recon I wont have to think about it later on... but then again... these decisions are so bloody hard to make.   And really until I meet with the surgeon and know more its even harder to decide. Any other ladies out there who had immediate recon or has any advice for me. Thanks and hope you are all doing well.",

I mean that - yes it is sore of course it is - but we have great pain meds so use them.   I didn't sleep well, but every time the pain woke me they gave me a morphine shot so I could doze a bit more.   The SNB I will not lie, hurts like a bitch for seconds then its over.   Even the mental side of it all... I even looked at the wound this morning when my BS was checking it out to discharge me... and you know what?  All I could think was \"its OK... the cancer is gone its out of me\".  I get the path report in about 10 days - 2 weeks and as BS is away my family doc will go over it with me for the margins.    BS said today that he was extremely happy with how things went - so that makes me happy. Even the drains aint that bad.   For those with surgeries coming up, I know you will worry, but please try not to too much, look on it as just a step closer to being cancer free. Well I am off for a nap now and typing really does make the arm ache. Damiana, SecretAgent...hope you are doing as well as I am.

I am a right side sleeper, or was until I had my MX and now everytime when I sleep I try on my left side... but as soon as I try (in my sleep) to turn on my right the pain and aches and uncomfortableness of it wakes me and then I toss and turn and cannot get back to sleep... this in turn keeps my poor DH awake. Even though I offered to sleep in our spare room he will not let me. Anyway, she gave me some tabs called Everil(sp?) mainly used now for pain management and as nerve relaxers and they are not addictive which I liked. So hoping they work as no sleep makes for a grumpy me. Hope you all manage to have some peaceful sleep tonight and happy days tomorrow.",

Sucks on having LE already.  I just got my arm measured - and can you believe that my left arm (I had a right MX) is in 2 places .5 cm bigger than my right ??  And I am right handed. Cottontail: great news about figuring how to sleep with that stupid drain in.   They were the biggest pain the arse for me when trying to sleep.  Momto5: welcome - great place to hang out.   Sorry about your hair.  When I lost mine I kept telling myself that it was for the good of killing cancer and will grow back - still sucks though but we are here to hold your hand through your fears, laughter, crying, and pity parties. I still have some slight swelling on my chest and still underarm is so tender.  No one seems to concerned, but me... all I keep hearing is 'its normal - you had major surgery, give yourself time'.  Anyone else still having issues like this 5 weeks post surgery?  Hello to any I've missed - thinking of you all xxx",

Omeggo.. thanks for the reminder about the mantra \"in six months... in six months\".   Hoping that those with surgery in their rear view mirror are continuing to heal and recover nicely.  Anyone had a melt down yet... I did last night when my DH got home from work.  I was just so angry at everything and everyone.   I felt so good after a cry, whine, bitch and yell though.   Poor DH all he could do was hug me (gently) and that's all I needed from him too.  Today is another day and will be a better day.   The surgery means that the cancer is out of my body and I really am one step closer to being NED.   But damn it... I hate that my life was put on hold this year - for the first time in my life something outside of my control, controls my life and I didn't like it. As Beckers said... time to pull up the big girl panties Blessings - happy you sorted out your dates... yay, still an August girl indeed.

Pre-surgical appointment on Friday was very non-eventful. Apparently I am very fortunate to be so healthy going into this surgery - except of course for cancer - how ironic eh? How: A little denial never hurt anyone. Like you, I don't think I am concerned with the surgery as much as the recovery etc. Maybe I'll feel differently in an hour. Trinity: hope the new meds help you - sending sunshine thoughts your way. So frustrating when \u2018medical people' don't listen. Of course you know what works for you but they believe they know best. Nice of the in-laws to come and help out. Yay on banana split and lots of ice cream. Markat: yep I now go with the flow... I think I am, well we are all, entitled to bad days. Beckers - vent away - does us good. Maybe its your DH's way of dealing with you dx to focus on unrelated issues of which you don't give a crap. Omeggo: Agree with everything you said. This board has kept my sanity so many times. Had it not been for here so many part of my house would've been smashed to rid myself of the frustration and anger of my dx. Sandcastle - would love to see a pic of your new puppy . Lisa: hope you had a great weekend with your sister and cousin. That is a lot eh? 4 out of 5. Good thoughts to you all. Damiana - party sounds like a lot of fun...boobie cake is hilarious. Shabby: We are cancer patients with no patience Lisag46 - welcome - that's a lot of surgery to deal with, but like everyone else here - we'll be there for you Christina: Great you are doing fun things to take you mind of this. Hope you had a great time with your sister. Bet you cant wait to see your Mum - mines in the UK so I know how you feel, but thank goodness for Skype eh? Marilyn: What about making the bras into upside down tomato plant holders I have tried to respond to everyone - if I have missed you doesn't mean I'm not thinking of you. I have read all the posts and like everyone else am so grateful we have each other cos other people really don't understand the way we do. Sharing a bit of a funny story with you all... yesterday we got back from camping and I was in the garden and because it was so bloody darn hot I was \u2018topless', the thoughts of wearing a head covering brought me out in sweats. Anyway my neighbours MIL was standing on their deck and when she saw me shouted out \"hey Michele, how are you... you look great'.... As opposed to what - when I had hair  Just made me chuckle anyway. Wishing you all peaceful, busy days as August approaches with lots of ice cream and chocolate.",

For the ride home - yoga pants, zip up hoodie, pillow for car, knickers. Blessings... thank you so much for your post - phew.   Isn't it like everything in this journey... the waiting is way worse than the tx, surgery, rads.. whatever we wait for.   Congrats on your successful surgery and fingers crossed for being on the squishie side this month.

I didn't do too badly on chemo really.   As my signature notes I was on  the combination of Adriamycin & Cytoxan.   After about 6 hours of it being administered I just felt blerh... that's the only way I can describe it.   Achey feeling like the flu and just feeling crap.   But it only lasted for me about 4 days... then I was back to having 2 weeks of doing OK before the next lot.   I brushed my teeth aftermost meals and rinsed out with baking soda (1 tsp baking soda to just under a cup of warm water)... never suffered mouth sores during all chemo.  I did get that horrible crappy metallic taste where most foods tasted like they were out of a bubbling mud pool, but that could be the adriamycin.   Taxotere hurt me more - or it could have been the neupogen/neuelsta shots.    since I have finished treatment, I have read on these boards that Claritin works wonders in helping with the bone pain.   My emotions were closer to the surface as well.   For taxotere make sure you are given ice gloves for hands and feet...this really helps with the neuropathy... if where you go dont provide them.. take bags of peas or something. When you are feeling crap and not sure if you want to do it anymore... .keep focused on the fact that chemo works... shrunk my tumour from 8+cm to 1.5cm.   Its hard but it is doable.   Oh! and keep a daily journal of how you feel and take it with you to each appt with your MO... really helps them and you too... you can see it does pass.  Hang in there sister... we're here for you and can hold your hand through the worse... you are not alone.    Ask any other questions you may have or fears you have - share them.",

Omeggo... chemo is hard and who in their right mind would chose to cure ourselves of something with poison? But it works.... I am proof of that. My 8+cm tumour was shrunk to practically nothing. Beckers - what wonderful news about your friend. Shabby - good luck with the fills and exchange.   And thanks again for stating this thread.  Who would've believed when we all met that we'd be here, talking about our healing progress, and fills and everyday life.   Thank you !! Blessings... rad #6 today. Last night skin felt a little tender and red... I am lubing 3 x per day. So the techs told me to start using the saline soaks today. Also don't have a high energy level today so I am listening to my body and having a vegging day. I just keep focusing on this being the last stretch and then I can concentrate on recovery for real. I know I have missed some of you but don't mean I aint thinking of you. Peace & hugs to you all xxx",

And you're right at your age, why the heck should you have to dress terrible too. For me I am like GMA... too old to worry - and am wearing my DH's cotton shirts. I have a couple of oversized (for me) baseball shirts that we bought on trips to the States that I will wear when I go out. Your Dad sounds wonderful. And your sister may not care what you look like, all she wants is for you to be well... sometimes they say things in the hope it makes us feel better. Pinkie.. welcome to our group. And good luck for today's surgery. Let us know as soon as you can how you are. ChristyRN - how comforting for you that your chat with your eldest went so well.... Not having children myself I cannot even begin to imagine where you start with that. Must be a wonderful relief. Howm... ha ha ha. Great news on the clear results - woo hoo! Love good news. I continue to heal and feel better each day (pain meds still helping ). My underarm is still quite swollen and sore. I am getting my dressing changed tomorrow so will check with the nurse that is all quite normal. The drains are just a pain in the arse. I was tending to my garden this morning before it gets too hot and now sitting in catching up with you all in a nice AC house. I hope I haven't missed anyone, if I have I am still thinking of you and sending you some good mojo. Be kind to yourself ladies. Thinking of you and wishing you nothing but the best.

So ladies in the LA/California region... who would be the best people to contact to let them know of this disgraceful so called service.   I have emailed the LA chamber of commerce, but wondering who else I can contact to put the word out.   Thanks for any advice. One good to focus my pissy mood",

And honestly, if they don\u2019t like it, screw \u2018em. So today I was being nuked at 8am and went to a workshop from 9-1 through work. An amazing employment lawyer was speaking about a new workplace health and safety bill on bullying.. anyway there were lots of managers who I haven\u2019t seen since I was dx\u2019d. So one manager, who has always been a touchy, feely type came up to me and said \u201cI never knew you were so sick until a while ago, can I hug you\u2019 \u2018sure\u2019 I said. Well it was a bear hug \u2013 I thought my foobie would be squished never to be the same again. So after her asking how I was blah, blah.. she put her hands on my shoulders, gave me another hug, looked me in the eyes and said \u2018are you going to die?\u2019\u2026 WTF ? all I could say was \u2018not today I\u2019m not\u2019.

Adriamycin:  First things first.. and I sound like a broken record with this... drink plenty of fluids... I like water so that was easy for me.   Not sure if you have a port, I didn't but water keeps the veins open for any iv's.   Try and have a slow walk... even for 5 minutes, keeps the chemo moving and out your body.   I did not get diarrhea - I got constipation, but that may have been the anti-nausea drugs.  if that happens, take stool softeners a few days before chemo and after... you will find out what works for you.  Also I incorporated more fibre.  to keep mouth sores at bay, what worked for me was a baking soda mouth rinse after meals.   Hair loss - as soon as I knew I was doing chemo I got my hair cut really short.  As soon as it started coming out... I got it buzzed at the cancer agency - put me back in control.  Also it hurts, you will feel your scalp getting tender, that goes once its gone.   Crappy metallic taste in my mouth - everything tasted like a mud pool.. .except for some reason red apples - so I ate lots of them.  Cant say I really lost my appetite even with that.. darn it.   Oh! and your pee will be pink for approx 24 hours afterwards... I was so happy someone told me about that one... would've scared the crap outa me.   Felt just blerh, no energy for about 7-9 days after... then would start feeling better again.  Cytoxan:  Hair was already gone so that didn't bother me.  I did lose my brows and lashes, but they are growing back quite thick now - June 22 was last chemo for me.   Really for me the biggest piss off on this was my nails became very weak and brittle, even though I wore cold gloves.  I cut my nails very short.  I had such lovely long nails before... even these are growing back now. I was fortunate that I never had any nausea.   Take all the meds they prescribe even if you think you dont need them.    Keep a daily diary of how you feel - I took this with me to every appt. with my onc before infusion.  You'd be surprised how you forget.   Oh and then there's chemo brain... really !!  Listen to your body Trinity... if it needs to rest, rest.   Not sure when you are starting - but let us know, wear big pockets so we can jump in with you. Remember they always give you ALL  the worst case scenario SE's - we are all different and dont get all of them.   I am sure there will be some other great advice coming your way.  And ask any questions you have.

I had a umx August 2.   Only thing I can relate to is the tightness along the right side of my chest.  I still have tenderness and numbness under my arm - where they took the nodes.  My onc and BS also assured me that this will pass in a few months. I am sure there is a thread which relates to 'dog ears' on this board... if you cant find one, you can always start one and let others jump in with their experiences. Have a good weekend.",

She said not to splash out money on the medical camisoles for postop - they are expensive and not covered on benefits (least on mine). She suggested getting old or buying cheap tee's, cutting the arms out and wearing them and then pinning the drains - like she said, we are likely only going to need these for 2 weeks at most, so didn't see the value of buying the cami's. Also she said to start the postop exercises now to help prevent lymphedema. I was given a pamphlet for these - here's the link - hope works http://www.cancer.ca/~/media/CCS/Canada%20wide/Files%20List/English%20files%20heading/Library%20PDFs%20-%20English/Exercises-after-breast-surgery_2011.ashx One of the ldies on this board said that for showering she read that a cotton belt or pantyhose tied around the waist worked to pin the drains to so they didn't hang and pull.  She said it worked for her.  Prior to getting out of the shower she squeezed out the excess water, dried herself, put the t-shirt back on, re-pinning the drains, hung the pantyhose over the shower to dry - ready for next  use. Take cotton button up front pj's to the hospital.   Told me not to worry about a bra to go home in - that makes sense.   Again, to go home in comfy clothes, and tops that button at the front.  Oh, she did mention that for the tees - put your surgery side arm in first - sounds like we have to be contortionists, but I'm sure we'll do fine as others have before us. Janet also said that I would likely find the drain under the arm more uncomfortable than the chest one.    She will be in touch with me soon regarding a workshop she holds for postop ladies.  I'll keep you posted. There is so much we need to find out eh?  And I intend doing lots more research soon   I I'm sure if we share all the info we find out, we'll feel like pros before long. In the meantime, if you have any specific questions, let me know and I will call her to ask and get answers for us.  Oh! and happy news, saw my MO yesterday and chemo has shrunk my tumour considerably - woo hoo... so its hard, but it works - take that cancer! picked on the wrong person here. Today I am going to meet a friend for lunch and shopping trip.  The sun is shining here.  I hope you are all managing to enjoy your days. damiana - sounds like you had a lot of fun at your wig party - and yes, putting fun into our crappy situations does make it better.",

Since being home during chemo I did watch a couple of these episodes.  Actually it made me very very angry that for the sake of 'reality' (and I use that word loosely) tv they appear to portray 'early stage cancer' as not too serious. ALL CANCER IS SERIOUS !!     Chickadee... I couldn't agree more with you.  But it is wrong, by portraying this as they do they could be giving false hope to other women in the same situation.  She could say no, really she could.   But hey, that wouldn't be very good for ratings would it? Thanks for letting me rant and I hope someone does shake her up soon.",

The ladies on here are the most amazing bunch of people you will meet.  Knowledgable, funny, experienced.   Plus its where you can really express your feelings to others who know exactly what you are going through and no one judges. Good luck for Thursday and let us know how you get on. Take care.",

Well, until tomorrow when I meet with my BS, she couldn't confim if I would be having rads before surgery or after.   Anyway what she could tell me is this.  Rads will start approx 6 weeks after either chemo or surgery.. so lets say after chemo.  That will take me to end of July.  They will be for 6 weeks, 5 days per week.   She told me all about the side effects and I have a ton of reading to do and a dvd to watch.   She said that the rad therapists will go over with me what kind of bras etc I should get.   So really not much news - but I'll let you all know how tomorrow goes.

Tomorrow I will find out if I have rads first then surgery or vice versa.... like everthing during bc.. its the bloody waiting and not know that is the worst.
