AC 4 x 3 weekly, then carboplatin/taxol also 4 x 3 weekly.  Then radiation, then tamoxifen followed by an aromatase inhibitor. No port.  Aimster,  I took my first BodyPump class last week, and I thought it would kill me.  Chemo has got to be better than that (and I am strong, but clearly not fit!) Annie, my three children are 7, 10 and 12, but the 10 year old skipped a grade and thinks she's 11. :-)  I had a free TRAM reconstruction when I had my BPM 4 years ago (and it was a beautiful job), but they took the flap out to clean things out with this cancer.  (The cancer was near the sternum and they wanted to get all the nodes so I'd have ended up looking like a bad lawnmowing job if they took a strip off each side and left the middle, so out it all came. Hmph. (My biggest worry was that they'd remember that my breast was made from tummy tissue and attempt to put it back on my tummy.  Now, THAT would have made me unhappy!) I can have a lat flap reconstruction when this is all over if necessary.  And I had my ovaries out 5 years ago (that BRCA thing again), so I went into menopause at 41, so at least that is done! And I live in New Zealand, but I'm a Canadian (from Toronto) and my husband is Australian so I'm mostly really confused about where I belong.    Mary Margaret, shutting up now. (For the moment.  Maybe.)",

Right now I'm not exactly a nervous wreck, but I'm more of a nervous fender-bender.  Concentration isn't a happening thing and my children are really tense and bickering all day long.  (They're like my own personal Picture of Dorian Gray--I act normal (or so I claim--my husband would debate that) and the kids reflect my moods!)  For me, busy-work with my hands (painting a room, building a treehouse :-) while listening to podcasts or playing the piano (without the podcasts) have been what works best for me.  And lots of exercise.  But doing things that put me into the zone, where I have to concentrate on what I'm doing with my hands are great--I get to the end and realize that I've completely forgotten to worry for an hour or whatever.  Recurrence is a big worry for me, as BRCA cancers that are ER+ don't respond as well to treatment as non BRCA ones, but for now I'll focus on what's right in front of me, not what's way down the road!  36 hours to go! BAF, I really like your thought that we just have to show up. :-) The taking time off work thing is interesting.  One teacher friend was off for six months last year with chemo.  Another teacher friend missed 2-3 days per cycle, and that was it.  When my mum got OVCA she never went back to work at all, and she lived 5 years. I know that the anti-emetics are better now than then, but in the last 15 years it seems to have gone from people being on leave from the day they get the diagnosis till they're through treatment, to people trying to work through it.  I know that having something to do is important, but I'm not sure that I want my energy to be going into my responsibilities to others... Good luck to anyone starting chemo tomorrow!   Mary Margaret, who went for a run today and then a BodyBalance class and THEN treated myself to 3 hours by myself at the mall as a distraction (and got my toes done).  My husband goes back to work tomorrow, chemo starts the day after, and school doesn't go back for a month.  (It's summer vacation here!)",

One of my fun treats where I live is that literally EVERYONE here knows what is going on with me.  We have a shortage of medical oncologists here in Wellington, and because I'm stage II, ER+, no nodes, I was not at the top of the waiting list.  (Don't get me wrong--I wouldn't give up free universal healthcare for anything, but there are times when being rich and privileged in a hierarchy looks more appealing. :-) Anyhow, the Wellington paper ran an article on the shortage and concluded with \"Are you affected by this? If so, ring this number to speak to our reporter!\"  I did, and ended up on the front page of the Wellington paper.  Three times.  (Search in Google for \"cancer appointment wait New Zealand\" and you'll get me.  I am not putting the link in, because I do have hopes that it will vanish in time.) (If you do find the article, notice the way the photographer camoflaged my son's lunch all over his clothes by hiding him behind me.) At the time, I was very glad I did it--they need a public face on these things or change doesn't happen, and I was pretty concerned with some aspects of the situation.  But then, in one of those \"people are so utterly amazing\" moments.  Someone bought a lottery ticket for me (so I could travel for treatment, bless him!), IT WON $700 AND HE POSTED IT ANONYMOUSLY TO ME!! So what could I do?  I had to contact the reporter again--I just couldn't not, after an incredible act of generosity like that, but now EVERYONE approaches me on the street.  My community has about 150,000 people in it, and I apparently know them all.  Last night, the mother of someone I knew years ago (our kids were in the same preschool for 6 months) approached me at the supermarket, blithely sure that I would remember her.  (I did, but only because she has her daughter's remarkable smile.)  I am so grateful and overwhelmed by the experience so far, and by people's kindness, but really, truly, I am an introvert and would like to not be public property.   I was happy to let people I know in real life know the full story--I HATE when some people know (which, in Lower Hutt, means that everyone knows) but no one knows who is allowed to know, so it's all discussed in whispers.  And I hate it even more when kids are involved, as keeping secrets from them is pretty well impossible.  (A friend got cancer last year, and told 2 friends but not her kids.  So every mum at school knew before her kids.  That was bad.) But there is a difference between that and every clerk in every shop I go into saying, \"Have you started your treatment yet?\" Maybe I should get some very odd wigs and big glasses.  I could go incognito!  (If I start wearing makeup that will provide enough camoflage. :-)  Or I could go commando and paint my head a startling colour--like bank robbers who dye their hair orange to distract people from their face. Today I am on a tiny island in Wellington harbour.  It is a nature reserve and access is controlled.  (There are 5 families staying the night tonight.) The ranger who briefed us asked how my treatment was going. Ack!!!!! (I'm sure I've met her before, but I have NO idea where.  But in Lower Hutt, everyone knows everyone, and most have lived here 10 generations.  And I have an accent (Canadian) so I stand out! Anyhow I don't mean to whine--I've receive some wonderful gifts.  But I'm ready to become private again!   MM, very very glad my hair has not chosen today to start falling out.  (Yesterday would have been fine.  Tomorrow will be fine.  Taking the ferry home 1/3 bald would not be fine!)",

Julie, I don't know if I could do the classes under normal conditions, but my only priority now is beating this, so I'm willing to do 6am classes, knowing that I can always have a nap later on if I need to.  I've been doing a plan of targetted activities.  Today I HAD TO run, make dinner, get my daughter's uniform in to be shortened before school starts in 2 weeks and a couple of other trivial things.  Beyond that, everything else is a candidate for being dropped if I don't feel up to it. Rest trumps everything!  It has helped that my sleep has been so weird, as often as not, the days of th 6am classes were days that Mr Dexamethasone and I have been up partying until 3 am, so it's not like I was going to make it through the morning no matter WHAT time I got up!   MM, now sporting a #4 haircut, but with a lovely full bag of hair to post to NSW. :-)",

Do you have anyone who could help out?  You need to prioritize--one thing that works for me is to say to myself, \"Looking back, 10 years from now, will I be glad that I pushed through and did X?\"  If I realize that looking back, I'd think, \"What an idiot--I should have just backed off from that for 6 months!\" (I hear that a lot, oddly enough) I try to listen.  I know that it's important for us to be doing meaningful things, but not at the expense of our health (literally our lives for us) and our families. (And while I'm also trying to be there for my kids' things, \"being there for my family\" does not necessarily include cooking a proper meal each night.  A few months of frozen meals or takeaway isn't going to kill them.) I had always assumed that if I got cancer I'd be the sort of person who worked right through, taking off only a day here or there when things were worst.  I'm finding out that actually no, I'm not that kind of person, and I'm very happy to use my former work time (admittedly volunteer work, but they are left hanging and overworked right now, just like a business would be) in exercise, rest, researching this disease, shopping for scarves online :-), and reconnecting with the friends who are helping me get through this.  I know that not everyone has that choice and I feel lucky that I can take this route. And do feel very guilty for letting my colleagues down, but this is a short period of my life and I want to get it right. The \"brave, happy face\" thing is a real pain, isn't it?   I've decided that the phrase, \"Oh, I have my moments...\" is a really useful one to let people know that it's not all TV and ice cream, and that just because I've got my company face on doesn't mean that it isn't hard at times.  I also find that when I hear other people use it, it helps remind me that we all go through that pit at times, and that others who appear fine are also struggling.  Can you think of a way that you can vent?  Would counselling help?  Talking with a close friend?  I started a password-protected blog, purely for purposes of spilling all my worry and negativity on. (I type way faster than I write, which is why it's not a paper journal.) I don't re-read it, and I plan to delete it permanently when I'm done, but I do think it's really important to get those dark things we have to deal with out there, rather than bottling them up.  Repressed emotion is really really bad for us.  (I can share the studies if you like. :-)  Keep sharing with us in any case--we get it and won't judge! I think for me, the single biggest part of this thing is figuring out how to listen to my inner self and doing what it tells me.  I'm so used to doing the \"right\" thing (as defined by everyone around me) and doing my duty (Can we spot the Good Catholic Girl?  The eldest child and only daughter of an alcoholic parent?) that it is very hard for me to use my own judgement on what feels right for me to do instead of just assuming that I have to do everything.  In some ways this has been liberating for me, as I reckon that there is no other time in my life when society will expect less of me. :-) It is really really hard for me to not feel like every moment needs to be full ofTHings I Must Do, but leaving some space for the unexpected nap attacks, or just to catch my breath, feels like the right thing to do right now. I really hope you do find a way to create the space for you to heal, to rest, and to deal with this stupid disease fully, rather than feeling like you have to shove dealing with it into the spaces left over in the rest of your life.     MM, who initially planned to go away and run a national meeting the weekend I got the Dx, but eventually I worked out that if my husband was returning at top speed from Singapore (leaving conference panels unchaired in the process), then possibly it would send the wrong message about my priorities if I went away for my volunteer work, however fulfilling it normally is.",

I remain in awe of all you superwomen who have been working fulltime.  Tammy, I'm singling you  out because you're a school principal so you have the chaos of the kids AND the management/funding rubbish and a house of young kids.  Just thinking of it makes me totter off for a little lie down.  Tottering off for a lie down remains my main activity these days.  I can so I will!  I had my last AC 3 weeks ago, and went away to a volunteer thing that weekend.  (As I've said, I'm national vice president (voluntary) for an early childhood preschcool that has about 500 centres, and we have a big national meeting twice a year (and a conference in May).  I missed the last meeting (the week of my diagnosis) and the organisation came out in an uproar, deciding that a whole new structure was needed nationally.  Not a good meeting to miss.  THIS meeting they were deciding on the structure, so I really needed to be there.  I was there in spirit only, since I spent most of the actual meeting time sleeping, but I saw everyone at mealtimes. :-)  Even though I slept most of the time, it really wiped me out.  I was shattered for about 8 days after that one (although I realize AC#4 is the hardest anyhow).  Just a zombie, sleeping as much as I could, and really struggling to do the family stuff.  (Family== get kids to school in uniform, pick them up, take them to activities, feed them.  It did not include laundry, tidying or bathrooms.)  Then I spent the whole remaining 2 weeks trying to get cauaght up, and didn't get there in the end.  (Have a huge pile of clean-unsorted laundry today and some tables in the house are piled high with Stuff. Bleah.)  It was a good lesson to me though that for me, this Taking It Easy thing is really important.  I'm shocked that 3 days away had that effect on my recovery. On the positive side (and there's heaps of positive) my kids are SO happy and settled these days.  My DD has started intermediate/middle at a new school where she (a shy but social girl, if that makes sense) knew no one and it's been a bit of a struggle, but I have so much time to spend with the kids, since I'm never out at night or away on weekends (I used to go away once a month for a weekend).  I'm so glad.  Of course the fact that my brain is in just the right place to read 75 Zac Power books in a row and find them interesting doesn't hurt at all.  (Would he please stop writing those books!!  Two more waiting for us at the library today...)  It also helps that I find folding socks intellectually challenging, and I get the same sort of cognitive thrill from deciding how to load the washing machine that I used to get from writing journal articles.  On the other hand, when I try to actually read the emails about our new structure (or worse, try to comment on them), I feel the way my kids do when I hand them Faulkner to read.  This is good, and keeps me grounded and not trying to do things that would be stupid for me to be doing.  (Cf my utter awe of you that are all still working.)  I just can not see any reason to add the anxiety and stress that would come from  trying to do that stuff--especially when I'm a volunteer.  It's not like I'll lose money or run out of sick leave.  When I no longer find unloading the dishwasher a delightful achievement, it will be time to get going again. (See, you don't need me to write often--I make up for it in volume!) Am still going to they gym although after AC4, I ws the slackest yet.  Stopped classes and went to the treadmill or elliptical and predictably, the sessions got shorter and shorter.  I am getting back on track though and am increasing again.  Am not fussed if the next 3 months aren't the fittest of my life.  This is reinforced by my decision to do a hill run on Sunday--a 5 mile loop starting at the top of a giant hill.  At the bottom of the loop, as far as possible from my car, just as I was about to run (all right, walk purposefully with the odd jog thrown in on downhills) up this gorgeous river valley (and then slog up the cliff at the end to my car), the heavens opened and I got as wet as if I were swimming up the river.  Half of our region ended up flooded, cars were washed away--and I was in a river valley with no phone coverage, no roads (so no chance of a pickup) and looking like I was entering a mud wrestling competition.  Clearly Exercise Is Evil, and I'll go back to exercising my fingers on the remote control for a while instead. Started Taxol/Carboplatin yesterday. They did the whole scary \"let's worry about anaphlaxis\" thing with the Taxol--premeds, having it in a bed with oxygen all ready and a nurse in the room for the first 10 minutes, starting it REALLY SLOWLY etc etc.  it was fine, of course, and the carbo was a non-event.  Everyone was really thrown by it being a taxol/carbo combination, which is really uncommon there (and this is the first they've ever done for breast cancer in Wellington).  So everyone i talked to would say, \"Oh, you're starting Taxol today.\"  \"And carboplatin.\"  \"CARBOPLATIN?\"  And then there would be a mighty rustle of paperwork and attempts to look like they knew it all along. It has been very tricky finding out what meds I should be on or what the likely reactions would be or how hard it would hit etc.  Very annoying.  Finally I stopped trying to get answers from humans and went to the Australian EVIQ website, claimed to be a Health Professional (Hey, this is my full time job now!) and downloaded the protocol for High Risk Early Stage Ovarian Cancer, and it was just what I'm getting and had all the details.   Which made me very obnoxious yesterday, as I questionned dosage, prescriptions (\"It says here I should have ondansetron just in case\") and protocols.  (\"Which one am I getting first?\" \"Oh, whichever they get ready first, I imagine.\" \"It says here that it has to be the paclitaxel (Taxol) because it can interact with the carboplatin and that will increase the risk of myelosuppression and peripheral neuropathy.\" \"Let me see that...\") My old life was as a human factors engineer, and rule 1 there was that when you were dealing with new or unfamiliar situations, or were changing significant things from the familiar situations, that's when errors creep in, and Bad Things Happen, so I was happy to be a bit bolshie.  I brought chocolate chip cookies (proper, chewy ones, not the dry awful ones that people think are normal around here), so I'm hoping the bribery won me back into their good graces.  My only reaction so far has been an really annoying full body itching, but I expected that, since about 6 years ago it started happening when I got stressed.  Perfume free laundry powder mostly stopped it, but if I was goign to have any reaction, that's the one I expected.  Am just waiting on a phone call to confirm that I can take more anti-histamines.  Fingers crossed on the bone pain.  None yet, but it's early days... So 11 more weeks of this, then rads, then Aromatase Inhibitors for 5 years and that sexy Prince William pattern baldness!  So nice to feel like there is progress.  (Maybe I can marry into the royal family if I have the right hair style?) Am very glad to keep reading the updates.  Please keep in touch, even those who are moving on.  I feel like we're family and I love to know how you all are doing, even if I am the delinquent correspondent.  (I blame distance.  It takes weeks for those electrons to travel by waka from New Zealand to the rest of the world.) Love,   Mary Meg.",

My children are all hyped up on jelly beans and chocolate, so hiding from them (and hanging out with you all) seems like the best way to spend Easter afternoon! So glad to hear how many of us are finished chemo! Lucky ladies!  I'm 8 down and 8 to go.  I'm 1/4 of the way through the taxol/carboplatin combination (after having my last AC 6 weeks ago).  I'm on a 3 week cycle, with TC the first week, then just Taxol for the second and third.  Repeat x4. Am finding the TC combination much much harder than AC ever was.  While I felt very \"not me\" with AC and felt quite yucky and tired, the TC feels like I'm being beaten up by a gang.  Actually about 12 gangs, each one with it's own specialty.  One gives me mouth sores, one makes me nauseated, one gives me a full body itching including raised welts whenever I scratch.  One has been stealing my eyelashes and eyebrows, and several have been ganging up to make me very tired.  Another has been giving me chest pains and shortness of breath, one has been refusing to let me sleep, and one has been making absolutely everything taste like platinum, which is a beautiful metal when handed to me in the form of jewellerly, but is not so endearing when sprayed all over my taste buds.  Then again there is the crew who are after my fingernails (but they don't want my beautifully painted toenails--go figure?)  The last gang is stealing my red blood cells, but I'm going to thwart them with a transfusion this week. I'm really lucky not to have bone pain (yet) and am hiding from that gang if they try to show up! It did help this week to find out that most of the fatigue is likely caused by dropping my hemoglobin by 1/3 in 3 weeks.  I'm lucky that a friend had asked to take the kids for a day at the end of this week, so I've got 6 hours available for the transfusion.  (6 hours?!?  Is it so we can savour every drop as it goes in and admire the hue?)  I had had other plans for the day (shopping, resting, a massage?) but you know, hooking up with an IV can be fun too.  I'll be on the rheumatology ward, which will be a new experience, at the very least. To be honest, it will be the last day of the 2 week school holidays, and (did I mention that the children are hyped up on food dye and chocolate?) I may well be ready to have a day without them by that point anyhow. The chest pain is a fun symptom and I highly recommend it if anyone is feeling neglected or short of attention.  Apparently I didn't use the right code word when I saw the junior doctor last week, and he didn't react right away.  I followed up later in the appointment and he said that they don't worry unless one is short of breath.  I replied by telling him how my kids had described our latest hike up the hill to my husband, (\"... and she could only go like SIX STEPS without having to stop and rest, and when we found a bench she could hardly get to it and then just SAT THERE for TEN MINUTES, and then when we moved she could STILL only go six steps before needing to catch her breath AGAIN!\") (I felt like I was listening to them describe my grandmother.)  Anyhow, the nice doctor got all excited at that point, and I got the attention I crave.  I'll have an exercise ECG one of these days, but I had a resting one that day, right away.  They did say that the hemoglobin drop can put pressure on the heart too, so the body's response can be out of proportion, and getting some blood into me should help. The junior doctor (which I keep mentioning because it drives me mad to see him--everything he discusses with me then needs to be discussed with the real oncologist if I say anything interesting at all--but I don't get to be part of that conversation--he just leaves the room and returns, saying, \"I've spoken to ... and they say...\"  And I worry that what would be interesting to a real oncologist might not catch his attention through his juniorness), anyhow, he also told me that my hair probaby wouldn't come out any more than it had--by weeks 6 or so of Taxol people's hair comes back. (I had had 3 by that point.)  I don't think he knows carboplatin, since I've been shedding like a puppy all weekend.  My hair was firmly committed to my head on Thursday, but is quite flabby and weak in resolution  now.  Down to about 1/4 eyebrows, and hoping to go no further, but will take it as it goes! I'm glad that Easter is over.  It's a very big week in our family and I'd been dreading having the carbo plus taxol on Holy Thursday, (not least because I also had to do birthday shopping this weekend) and being knocked flat for such an important week.  We're pretty much through it now, aside from the overtired crying and bickering (and the kids are a bit off colour too!), and I'm going to generously let my husband  enjoy that aspect of the holiday while I go off and have a rest! Good luck to everyone on the Mx decisions.  It's a really hard decision to make.  I have to say that I was really happy with my reconstruction--I didn't realize how happy until I ended up with the messy scar high up on my chest and the deflated breast.  It's such a personal decision though; I sympathize with everyone trying to make it.  (I'm trying to decide if I should go for a third reconstruction--greedy, that's me!) I hope you all have a long weekend and are able to enjoy time with your families.  MaryMeg.",

(Not that we'll stopposting of course!) I finished my taxol/carboplatin yesterday and am amazed at my frame of mind.  Things that I've been procrastinating on for 6 months are all done.  (Other things, like tidying my house, don't seem to be happening however, hmm.)  They were all simple things that would only take a phone call, but they involved forward planning (like having a tradesman in ) and it's like I was afraid to make any plan at all that involved a schedule, because I've been so flaky. I find it mind-boggling, because my last Taxol was YESTERDAY, so it's not like my physiology is noticeably different today than it was, oh, 3 days ago, but suddenly I feel like I'm looking forwards again, instead of treading water.  I have a weekend plan that involves having my toenails painted royal blue with sparkles, just to say \"So There!\" at chemo.  (Oh dear, there goes my reputation for maturity!) I had a transfusion on Monday, to try to get my hemoglobin out of the 85 range and it had an astonishing impact, much better than the last transfusion.  Pity I didn't have it before I played the piano at Mass last Saturday night.  Oops.  (It's hard to do new, complex tasks that require lots of attention sharing (watching the priest, the overheads, the person running the projector system, the music and the piano all at once) when your brain is sitting there going, \"Duuuuuhhhhhh.\") I was also amazed at the psychological difference.  I was SO low, for the past few weeks, and I thought it was a normal part of chemo (and I guess it sort of is) but the transfusion made it all go away, so I finished on a high.  This is good, because I'd hoped to trot gracefully across the finish line, but if not for the transfusion I'd have been one of those who staggers down to the finish, then trips and lies on the tarmac till they come with a stretcher.  Not quite the image I was hoping for. Did anyone else find that chemo just destroyed their hand?  All of mine was in my right hand, and it now looks shocking.  It's yellow and mottled with purple all across the knuckles and sides; the veins are completely munted (takes a minimum of 2 tries to find one that works), scratches no longer heal--it's a real delight to look at.  (And my platelets are now at 1/3 of normal too, (and I already had a mild clotting disorder), so I'm a wee bit paranoid about cuts!)  I have a week old cat scratch on that hand, and on Monday when I got the transfusion, they gave me a prescription for antibiotics (which I thought was ridiculous)--until I woke Tuesday morning to find it red and puffy.  I think I want a refund on that hand. Aside from that, I've been very lucky.  I had a week of the Neupogen shots a while back which also gave me a HUGE boost of energy (which is not recorded in the literature, so apparently it wasn't a real boost, just a figment, but I'll take it either way!) Next up I have rads (time to start reading again!).  I had my planning session on Monday, but they are coming up with two plans for me, one involving the mammary nodes and one not.  I'm taking the mammary one (esp after my oncologist said that if it were her, she'd insist on it), so I really hope that it doesn't involve destroying my heart and lungs to get the nodes.  That would be a nuisance!  UTMom, I don't have my eyebrows and lashes fully bck, but the lashes are definitely growing. No one can see them, but I dont'care--I know they are there!  Try feeling for them--I could feel mine before I could see them.  (All right, I still can't see them. :-)  No head hair, but the carboplatin is to blame there.  I'm still not over the thrill of having no leg hair, so I'm happy to be bald a while longer. Sorry to hear about your neutrophils, ProudMom.  I had one chemo when mine were at 600 (that ws the one where I got the shots, oddly enough).  It's a bit unnerving to have them so low, isn't it?  Glad you're able to go with the rads now.  Yorelh, I hope your drain is gone by now and your BMX recovery is good.  WIll you be having a reconstruction?  I've got a plastics appt in 10 days and need to start getting my head around my options there.  (I had a preventative BMX and TRAM reconstruction 5 years go, and my brain just can not deal with the idea of reconstructing the same breast TWICE. I hope the New Zealand public health care system can deal with it. :-) Christine, that is so cool about your hair.  I hope it improves every day! marial, everyone I've spoken to says that effects get worse for a few weeks afterwards before they improve, both with chemo and rads.  Hardly seems fair, does it?   MM, off to see if there is any food in the house that doesn't taste of metal.  (How long before food is nice again?  Anyone?)",

Glad to hear about those whose hair is behaving.  Mine is still short--it used to grow very quickly (6\" a year), so my frustration that it's still not shoulder length is huge--it was waist length (I donated 24\") when all this started.  And my eyebrows look like I let a pack of 6 year olds practice waxing on them.  I have some lovely friends who are beauticians (and one who used to run Look Good Feel Better) and they have gently mentioned a few times that filling in the eyebrows would make a difference, but once again, my engineer's sense of style is taking the lead and I'm leaving them patchy. (My legs, luckily, are also patchy.  Hey, for all I know, my hair might be too, but I have so much of it, I wouldn't notice.  For the past year it has looked like nothing so much as a curly bush. Meh.  I'm hoping that the fact that I no longer feel superstitious complaining about it is a good sign.) We had a fun scare a few months ago--I got a lump on the exact site of the original tumour (Tinkerbell)--on the day of my original diagnosis-- and EVERYONE was freaking out.  The radiologist's words were \"You don't have to be Einstein to know what we're seeing here,\" the surgeon, when I was making (nervous) small talk at the appt where I found it and asked how his day was going said, \"You've ruined it thoroughly,\" and my pessimistic husband was possibly the least cheerful person alive.  Unfortunately, my kids are quite switched on and my 11yo girl figured it out when my husband came with me to the appointments, so we had a period of serious local panic.  Oddly, I wasn't panicking.  I knew which way the odds were tipped, but I'm not  one to count chickens early and I've had a few very unlikely events recently (in addition to getting cancer AFTER having my breasts removed, I won a travel prize of $100k of flights a year ago.  How cool is that?)  So to cut a long story a bit shorter, it was a false alarm, but it was quite tense.  Not least because all the hospital oncologists went away just as the results were ready to a conference and were planning to make me wait 2 weeks fo results that were ready in 3 days.  I ended up getting in touch with the office of the New Zealand Health and Disability Commissioner and they got in touch with the hospital and they worked out a way for me to get the results without having my hand held by the surgeon at the time.  (The hospital was insistent that the results would need to go through the multi-disciplinary committee first;  I was insistent that they were my results and I had a right to them as soon as they were available!  (Watching my daughter and husband bravely mope was starting to put me off my food.) Even if that wasn't enough of a wake-up call to count my blessings, a good friend died last week.  She was within 6 months of my age, and her cancer had metastisized when it was found.  She had a very good run (and NZ has a fabulous group called Sweet Louise that takes care of women with metastatic BC), but it is still sobering. I hope that everyone we haven't heard of is staying well.  I'd love to hear how everyone is doing.   MM, who had been a bit casual about the tamoxifen until October but I am quite careful about it now. :-)",

I'm a statistical anomaly in lots of ways.  I'm BRCA1 (which is not very common); I had a double prophylactic mastectomy 4 years ago to ensure that I didn't get breast cancer, but I got it anyhow (which is particularly uncommon!) and my cancer is ER+, which is also very uncommon for those of us who are BRCA1.  From now on I'd like to just play the odds and beat this thing! I'm looking forward to getting to know the others who will be going through chemo at the same time as me, and working out how to cope best.  I'm having AC (doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide), followed by taxol/carboplatin. (The carboplatin is because of the BRCA1 mutation, and just to make chemo more fun!)  I do have a question, for those of you who know more about this than I do--with AC chemo, how long is it likely to be before I lose my hair?  I've got a rather thick mane of it (which I gather means that it will fall out quickly when it starts to go--the weight of it will pull it out), and I'd like to be prepared.  Mary Margaret, feeling like I should be introducing myself as though I've just joined a country club. :-)",

How many of us have blood draws between treatments?  We just have it done the day before the next one.  I scraped through and am a wee bit nervous of not making it next time. My SE have gone up this time.  Manageable nausea, but insane fatigue.  Everytime there is a good chance (and sometimes without one), I just drop into my glassy-eyed fish on a platter routine.  Today 2 of my kids started school (at different times, in different places, one at a new school, of course), and I felt like I was in a comedy routine.  Send child out door.  Flop onto bed.  Leap out of bed at alarm, plop possum on head, make chitty-chat to other new parents, drive home, seal door, debone onto bed again.  My youngest, who had unlimited computer time while I was doing my dead fish routine, thought he had gone to heaven (although he was disappointed that we didn't go geocaching or bowling as we'd hoped to). Made it through the pickups, the swimming lesson, and more chit-chat with new teachers, then let my 12yo make carbonara again (4th time since I started chemo :-).  Am going to have to work out how to look more languid and Garbo and less grey and glassy! Anyone else finding the steroids filling them like a vase?  I finished my steroids (mexadethasone) for round 2 on Sunday and last night (Monday night) I was up to the loo about 900 times.  No wonder we're on water restrictions around here--I was hogging it all.  I didn't know that was an SE, but it it's not, then I'm not just turning into a fish, but a fish bowl as well.  Hmm. This was day 6 for me, so I'm hoping for a gradual turnaround starting tomorrow, when child #3 also starts school and the other 2 get themselves there and home without help.  I have leftovers thawing (a phrase to cheer any family) so I plan to sleep the whole 6 hours they are out of the house tomorrow if I need to (and I expect to need to!)

I'm baaaack!  I've been reading all the postings but haven't had much time/energy for posting myself.  I had my 2nd AC 2 weeks ago and found it much more tiring than the first one.  Am more or less back to normal, but keep getting whacked by the \"Take A Nap\" bus.  Last night I pushed through (at least till dinner was made), then ended up in bed with chills, hot, chills, hot.  A wee bit scary.  Just before that I got a massive headache and took Tylenol, so I don't know what that did to any fever.  My normal, evening baseline temperature (which the cancer nurse got me to make sure I know) is 96 degrees (35.5C), so even when I was burning up, my temperature only got to about 97.3 (after the TYlenol.)  I knew it was way up on normal, my husband knew it was way up, but we also both knew that no one was likely to take it seriously when it was below what it normally should be!  Luckily I'm fine this morning, (and temp is 36/96.8) but we were both quite worried.  (DH kept muttering \"sepsis!\" under his breath to cheer me up.) I was planning to go to a funeral this morning--the only child, 18 months old, of an acquaintance,-- but as every preschooler in New Zealand (and their parents) will be there, after last night I am staying away. I too found the second round of AC a bit rough and am glad there are only 2 more.  I've heard from several friends that weekly Taxol is much easier, esp once the AC is out of our systems. I'mnot going to be doing it weekly (since I'm adding carboplatin to the Taxol), but will give updates from The Land of Platinum Chemo once that starts. Have been watching tons of DVDs, mostly old episodes of THE WEST WING. I love watching on a laptop!  Am very grateful for the tip on the lint roller.  I'm starting my second shedding and am looking forward to getting rid of most of what remains.  I'd also love to lose my sideburns, but my hair is a bit longer (it was a #4, a month ago) so they aren't as obvious. Star Trek sucks me in (I'm a certifiable geek) as does anything before 1965--the older the better.  (Had my 7 year old asking to watch NORTH BY NORTHWEST and HIGH NOON recently.  Get them early, that's my philosophy!) Jean, thanks for the suggestion on the decadron.  I only get 2 pills though, so not sure what to do.  Will ask onco. Am very happy with my wig.  A number of people have told me it's the best they've ever seen, and 2 have told me it makes me look 10 years younger!  Best part of all?  My 10 year old daughter presented with lice this week and I don't have to worry about getting them! (That was always my nightmare.)  Yay!  (Lots of mother/daughter bonding time in progress.)  I've got some lovely hats and scarfs, but they aren't getting any use at the moment.  Partly that's because at home I go commando if the wig is annoying (only by the end of the day). I'm curious about why people are using shampoo on mostly hairless heads?  ('m just using the Dove soap I use on the rest of me and am enjoying the liberation.  My husband, who sports a #2 most of the time, uses expensive shampoo and conditioner and I just don't get it.  I had \"Pantene Girl\" hair, so it made sense to me.  He has \"sea captain\" hair (and beard), so I can't see why he'd bother! Emily, I hoe the shedding goes okay.  I found it really useful to have a buzz cut when that happened--shedding tiny hairs wasn't nearly as traumatic, but the buzz still covered my head so I didn't feel bald right away.  (Where in Ontario are you?  I'm from Toronto.) Sherry, that's wonderful about your daughter.  I hope that youfind yourselves coming back together as you work through this! Like a few of us, I'm dreading #3 AC next week, but am glad that AC will be 3/4 done.  Have decided not to fast, just as a data point, to see if it was making a difference.  I'm also a bit worried about WBC, and would hate to fast for 2 days and then be deferred!  I have the 3 weekdays between now and then full of appointments for kids and pets, and have grand plans for cooking and freezing gourmet meals.  (That's not going to happen, but I like planning. :-)  Good luck, everyone--hang in there!",

I don't know if any of you know of the studies that have found that people who eat way fewer calories than normal (like half or less), tend to live a very long time?  It's been reproduced in mice, particularly, and their cells work like ours in lots of ways.  Some of those scientists were looking at why this happens, and they've found that fasting (in mice) causes cells to go into a sort of protective mode that is almost dormant, and keeps cells from dying at the normal rate.  They wondered how that would work with cancer, and found that FOR MICE, if you starved/fasted the mouse, the normal cells were protected 1000-fold from the effects of chemo, while the cancer cells were killed off at the normal rate. (Cancer cells are well known for not following instructions, so in this case, they didn't go dormant, but kept partying.)  Again, this is in mice; there are no full studies of this in humans.  Normally all cells in our body are equally vulnerable to chemo, but in the mice research, they found that only 1 normal cell would die for every 1000 cancer cells that were killed by the chemo.  (The implication is that if this does work, you could really ramp up the chemo doses without hurting your patients, since right now the limit on chemo doses is the damage done to normal cells.) There has been a human case study (published in a journal on aging (I assume because these scientists are mostly studying cell aging and death) www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20... looking at a very small number of people, and they found that it looked promising and seemed to reduce side effects quite a lot for some of them.  Because what little data there is seemed to offer benefit and no loss of effect for the chemo, and since it was a peer-reviewed study in a real journal (and reported in New Scientist) I decided to try it, and I've had very few ill effects from the chemo (but I've had lots of anti-emetics too--so who knows). I want to emphasize though: 1) I was trying it without it being through any medical process--it was purely my own reading of the research (although I was a scientist before I had kids) and it wasn't suggested by any doctor. In fact, my oncologist was away the day I started chemo and doesn't know yet! 2) While the research looks good so far, there is very very little of it, so there could be important stuff (good or bad) that we don't know, and I'd hate anyone to think I was suggesting they try it. We think that the cancer is killed off by the chemo just as well in this situation, but there is too little evidence yet to say for sure. The only way to know for sure is proper clinical trials, and they haven't been done. 3) It only works if the fasting is long enough for the cells to shut down into the protective mode (ie. 48 hours or longer before the chemo).  Again, people's doctors are not likely to suggest that as a routine idea. (I only managed 43 hours (I forgot to stop eating :-) ), and I don't know if that had any effect. Again, and I hate to harp but I have to say it, this was me (not a doctor) weighing up the science on my own behalf and deciding to take the risk that the benefits would outweigh the negatives, but there is so little evidence (however promising that little is), that if anyone wants to try it, please discuss it with someone who can read the paper and help you come to an informed decision--don't take my word for it, please! I did discuss it with others who have science backgrounds to make sure we all had the same take on it, but I'm annoying to argue with (being part bulldog) and I'm not sure how hard they'd have tried to talk me out of it. :-)  (And that said, I'm not one for complementary or alternative treatments normally and am pretty scientific/rigorous in my outlook, but again, the only person I was risking here was me!) I hope that gives you more information, anyhow! There is another writeup in press at the moment by some of the same authors, bt it hasn't been published yet--they're just teasing us with the abstract (somewhere--I've lost it).   MM, who was amazed at how easy and non-traumatic the fasting was.  Normally going without a snack finishes me off!

I got a buzz cut on Tuesday, (day 13) to ensure that my hair didn't fall out before I donated it.  The ponytail was exactly 24\", which was cool.  Friday night I noticed that my remaining was starting to come out a bit easily (but I was still happy going around on Saturday with just the #4), but last night (Saturday here) it started coming out by the handful.  Or what would have been the handful had it been more than 1/2\" long.  Fingerful?  Several times today I've locked myself in the bathroom and gone through it with a fine-toothed comb with a bit of tension on it, and about 80% of the hair is now gone.  I'm not nearly as scary looking bald as I'd feared, although at the moment I think my look is more \"advanced mange\" rather than \"bald\".  Would love to know how to get that shiny look on my pate (although I fear the children will draw on it while I'm napping if it's too attractive-looking).

My recipe has no cooking at all--you just mix the first lot of ingredients.  (You can melt the butter if you want, or cream it with the cocoa and egg.  Until very recently I never saw the instructions to cook the base--am assuming that's a raw egg thing.  I've always used raw egg and never had a problem.)  The original recipes also called for unsweetened chocolate, which provides a cool contrast to the very sweetness of the rest. Here's a link with a picture. http://www.joyofbaking.com/NanaimoBars.html ProudMom So glad your husband sees it that way and is supporting you.  Take care of yourself! navywife :  That is awfully scary to be BRCA1 and have 4 children.  How many are girls?  I'm 46 and just Dx (My mum and their sisters were 48, 50 and 52 and two of them died).  I worry a lot about my 10 year old daughter, especially since the kids (I also have 7 and 12 year old boys) all get genetics and that she is particularly at risk.  At least it's not BRCA2, so the boys won't get BC! You join me in the \"unusual\" category--we're both ER+, which isn't common with BRCA1.  Yay, us! What is your chemo?  My oncologist added carboplatin to my AC+T (making it AC+PT) because of the BRCA1 and because we don't beat ER+ as well as non-BRCA people. It's hard not to worry about those  stories you hear, but I find it best to just focus on the odds.  Finding it early hugely increases your chances.  Being Stage I is the best possible stage, and you're not TN, which gives more options.  By far the most likely scenario is that you will be fine.  Hang in there!  bdavis, are you also BRCA1? I am a HUGE believer in mastectomies for BRCA carriers, although the risk reduction is lower after a Dx, I believe.  I did it myself 4 years ago, but I was one of the very rare cases where the few remaining cells still went feral.   (And they DIED for it, so there!) Even so, it was in an easy to catch place, and I don't have to live with the \"what if\" of not doing it and then thinking I could have avoided the place I'm in.  I have an advanced degree in Maternal Guilt, so I'm glad that source of guilt is denied me.  Navywife, I can't believe yours went feral at 29.  That's awful.  How old were other family members?  I didn't even really worry till I was close to 40. lorenar, I'm glad you're feeling better (and sorry that day 1 was so hard).  Good for you on walking the dog!  ScienceGirl, how are you doing with the hair loss?  I wasn't as upset as I'd feared, but mine was very very short by then, which had a very different emotional impact.  It tended to squick those around me though. I hope everyone is well.  Who are the next of us to have The Chair?   MM, whose AC#2 today was very relaxing, except when the internet failed.  I fasted again (but will try #3 without it, just to see if it makes a difference).  Am so looking forward to breakfast.

Lucky husband can take kids to the ER if it's needed from now on! jcoutee, I totally understand on the BRCA thing.  It would be so nice to know why you've been hit like this at such an unusually young age.  On the other hand, at least you don't have to make decisions about having your ovaries out.  And the risk of contralateral (other breast) cancer for BRCA1 types is 28%, so you're spared that too.  Now you just need to get rid of what you've got and you should be okay!  I don't worry much because I've had the mastectomies--I figure I'mnot likely to get unrelated cancers, but if I hadn't had the mastectomies, the risk of cancer after cancer is just so high.  Yick. Julie, thanks for the reminder about steroids and emotions.  My kids were wild today--and I'm sure that is why.  Oops.  I've been popping in and out of my husband's study all evening just to share tidbits as I tidy through my paperwork basker and he finally followed me out to the kitchen to tell me how hard it is for him when I'm in this stressed out frame of mind.  I thought I was on the cheerful and happy end of normal, but I think I was probably closer to that wild-eyed cheer that sends people backing carefully out of the room.  Oops. We don't have wifi, but my phone tethers my laptop to the internet--except the latest update on the phone has it crashing all the time.  Bleah. I sympathise on the \"I totally understand what you're going through\" thing.  When my dad died, when my brother was 18, a teacher of his told me that he \"understood completely\" because his favourite uncle had died a few years ago.  Now the teacher was quite young, and in retrospect he probably did really get it if he'd been very close to the uncle, but I remember how disgusted our whole family was that he, at the elderly age of 28 or so, could have ANY idea what it felt like to lose your father at 18.  For some reason I don't mind it as much if they say \"I've been there\".  Because that's more about the general situation and not our emotions and our specifics. Full sympathy to those of you dealing with the snow days.  It would drive me mad to never know from one day to the next if school would be on or off or delayed or what.  And getting phone calls at 5am would not help! Welcome Nancy!  Sorry you're here, but it hope it all goes well.  I'm the same as you for the Tx, except my taxol will include carboplatin.  We're the unusual ones, getting it 3 weekly! I hope everyone is well. How are people feeling in general now that we're mostly getting into the routine of all this?",

I've reached that same number of daysafter AC #2 now (I'm half way through my 4xAC every 3 weeks) but the remaining hairs are hanging tight.  Not sure how I feel about that.  On the one hand, if I'm allowed do the the total-hairs-end-to-end thing, I'm going to have more hair than my husband again soon. (He's not allowed to count his beard)  OTOH, I'd like to be either bald or normal.  Right now I feel like I'm auditioning for the part of a middle-aged newborn baby.  Are they going to re-run Mork and Mindy?  I could do the Jonathan Winters part! Lots of sympathy for those with tender scalps.  I'm lucky; mine tingled on about day 5 after #1, but nothing at all since then.  Carla, the leg lesions sound awful.  Have others had that?  I totally sympathize on feeling like life is totally unpredictable.  I'm like that too.  I'm 16 days after AC#2, and should be perfectly fine, but still have no idea what I'll be able to do.  Today my husband arranged for us to go on a hike with some colleagues of his (and our children; 7, 10 and 12).  It was up and down some hills, about 6k in total distance; took us about 2.5 hours, including a break.  I was half-expecting to be shattered by it and spend the rest of the day in bed.  Instead I spent the rest f the day cleaning the house, buying groceries, and cooking. No crash at all.  On the other hand, 40 minutes before we went this morning, I was tottering off to the sofa to lie immobile for 20 minutes (trying not to panic at the thought of the possible ordeal that lay ahead).  It drives me mad not to know. I worry that my friends will think I'm a drama queen--constantly warning them that I may not be able to make things (only to then show up, perky and apparently fine)--while on the other hand, everyone else is thinking me unreliable as I promise to do easy things on what will be good days, only to end up doing the floppy fish instead.  (At least back in my youth when I phoned in sick I was able to fake sounding sick.  I hve no idea what faking In Cancer's Clutches would look like.  I supposed I could just take the wig off and flash my Darth Vader skull at them.)   Which is  long way of saying that some consistency and predictability would be welcomed! Have now been told by 4 unrelated people that the wig makes me look \"10 years younger\".  Am carefully not asking \"Younger than what?\" Am assuming that I now look a sprightly 37, not that I previously looked like an old hag with a young girl's hair.  Sherry, I've also been amazed at how survivors have reached out.  This week I got a card from the woman who last year taught recorder at my children's school.  She has moved away since then (I assume in response to the trauma of attempting to instill music into my 7 year old) and didn't put an address on the card, but \"wanted to encourage\" me.  People are so lovely. baf4292, I hope your arm gets better quickly.  I'm on AC and was given serious warnings about that--the adriamycin in particular has a terrible reputation for destroying tissue.  Our hospital does it as a \"slow push\" (I can not tell you the images in my mind until I saw what they really meant by it!) so that they can monitor it going in.  This is scary stuff they are putting into us! Amy, thanks to the link to your blog (and for the photo of the lovely Millie).  Don't feel a wimp at all--the combination of what we're going through and the way it drains us of energy and resilience makes it awfully hard to keep going.  We can make it though--one day at a time is all we need to face.  (My mum was diagnosed with Stage IV Ovarian CA and I remember her saying that she'd rather die than finish her first round of chemo.  She did finish it though--and then did two more sets of chemo later.  That was a real lesson to me of how people can hang on through things they never thought they could do.)  I do agree with you though--chemo is barbaric! It's nice to be able to vent to each other too.  Sometimes just saying how I feel helps me get past the feeling.  (Unfortunately, today's salient feeling--like all my clothes are getting too tight--seems unlikely to vanish through expressing it.  Darn.) How many of us sleep commando?  I bought a few pretty caps, including a \"Night Before Christmas\" style red night-cap which I love, to wear in bed, but I feel like a dork wearing a hat in bed.  Particularly when my husband happily sleeps in his half-bald, half-buzz cut head without any need for headgear.  Luckily the family has the good manners to not shriek when they see me bald(ish), and I quite like the feeling of the wind whistling through my sparse hair! (It was hysterical on the hike today--it was a really warm day, and I kept dropping behind so I could lift up my wig and get some airflow--I felt as surreptitious as a flasher, or someone trying to hawk stolen watches.  Anyone who saw me would have thought I was smuggling something up there, the way I was acting. Am not sure what I could smuggle between a wig and my scalp.  Bra halves? Carla, I am concerned that you were not told that we Must Have Goals.  Apparently Having Goals is what cures us of this disease--the treatment is just a decoy.  If you're not planning on doing the Hawaii Ironman, a PhD in neurobiology, a quick trip up Everest, and curing ingrown toenails, then you are Letting The Side Down.  The idea that it's enough to grit our teeth through the treatment, while taking pleasure in the little things like the kindnesses of those we love, seems to be out of fashion.  My goal (shared so that you can plan your own) is to rack up as many floppy fish hours on the sofa as possible.  Double points for having the TV or video on at the time (although I often  just listen, so as not to prematurely wear out my vision on all the movies I plan to watch while in floppy fish pose). Sometimes I sleep and take it in subliminally.  This is a serious Goal I am engaged in and I don't want to burn out early.  I hope you're paying attention and planning your own Goals. Hang in there, everyone!",

Sorry for being AWOL.  I feel like the number of hours in a day is so very short now, what with all the napping, and I'm just not getting to all the things I want to be doing.  On the positive side, my cats now believe that I have become a cat, as my activity to nap ratio is rapidly approaching theirs, and they now follow me from room to room and nap alongside me.  Their hair is longer, however, so my husband can still tell us apart. I have my last AC (#4) on Thursday, and will be glad to have it done, although I'm very nervous about the weekly Taxol+carboplatin that will follow it.  I can't find anyone doing weekly carbo, so I'm not sure what to expect. I'm very well, aside from the napping.  I'm still going to the gym every day and am sure I'm fitter than when I started chemo (not that that would be difficult).  I'm looking around for a half-marathon for the end of the year, as I should be able to manage one by then if things do improve after the chemo.  (Failing that, I'm hoping to find a staged race with naps embedded in the race.  Anyone know of a Sleeping Beauty Half-marathon?) My big preoccupation lately (besides napping) is the earthquake in Christchurch.  It's the worst disaster to ever hit New Zealand, and it has essentially destroyed our second-biggest city.   While in nearly every respect we're a normal, affluent Western country, we are a TINY western country, and i just can't see how a country with only 4 million people can absorb an earthquake that has caused the destruction of 1/3 of the buildings in the downtown, 10,000 homes etc.  I'm involved in an early childhood service  and we have 42 centres in the city, so even though I've been on leave, I'm aware of the impact. 20% of the people in Chch have had no sewage--for two full weeks. Many have also been without water or power for that length of time.  (At least Katrina didn't destroy the sewage pipes--they'll take months or longer to put back together)   It's just unimaginable.  And of course, on top of everything, the aftershocks are constant.  No wonder 80,000 people have left the city so far. http://www.geonet.org.nz/earthquake/quakes/recent_quakes.html I'm watching this weekend approach with a sense of bemusement.  Did I mention that my last AC is on Thursday?  Well somehow I have committed to go away for the weekend on Friday.  (Some people go through chemo as Superwoman; I'm going as StupidWoman.)  I'm the national vice president of my early childhood service (we have 500 centres altogether) and each year we have two semi-annual national meetings, plus a conference.  I missed th last meeting, because it was the weekend of my diagnosis.  This is the next one, and it's here in my town, 15 minutes from home, so I thought I'd go.  I expect I will sleep nearly the whole weekend, but I reckon that any time I do wake up, I can go visit everyone else. And if they really need me for anything, they can text me and I can interrupt my nap.  (That's scenario one.  Scenario two would be that my oncologist wants me to take the steroids, in which case I will not sleep at all on the weekend and they will end up regretting telling me where they were meeting because I never shut up all weekend long.)  We shall see.  I really want to be there though, because next year I'll be president, and having missed most of this year isn't really great preparation for that. My biggest fear for the weekend is that I'll forget the ondansetron at home! Second biggest fear is that I'll forget to wear possum and the delegates will all be traumatized by the sight of my bald head.   (Third biggest fear is what the kitchen will look like by the time I get back.  Can kids get scurvy in 2 days?)  I was wondering about the Claritin that people are taking--is that just for the neulasta shot, or do some take it with Taxol too?   I am making a list of questions about the TC chemo for my oncologist, and I'm aware of the various things people are taking (e.g. l-creatinine for neuropathy) and I really struggle with my desire to not appear flaky and gullible to my oncologist, but am balancing that against my desire to not look like my hands and feet are gangrenous.  And *I* know that the B6 and l-creatinine aren't flaky ideas, but there's no guarantee that the oncologist won't think so.  My husband went through med school and I'm very aware that in some areas they appear to deposit information in the med student's head and then weld the head shut to keep anything else out. At home, I find it entertaining when we are discussing things and I come up against a welded-shut area of brain, but I'm not so enthusiastic when it's my doctor.  (This is not because I ignore my husband's opinions, really.  I promise.  Possibly it's because I feel free to mock my poor husband, but  I am not sure that is a wise approach for my doctor.) I've been reading avidly and am so glad to hear of so many of us getting through this round of chemo.  I hope we stick together through the next treatments, even if it's not chemo!  Sending lots of supportive thoughts to you all--it's great to be in such a wonderful group of women! (And now I'm off for a nap, I think. :-)",

My nurse said to eat whatever I wanted, and I found myself craving things that were hot, salty, fatty and not hugely flavourful--like grilled cheese, buttered toast, etc. I did find the AC cumulative, and my last dose was much harder than the first.  Good thing there are so few of them!   Good luck managing with the kids; that would be the hardest part.  The more rest I got the better I felt.   Mary Meg.",

I was really looking forward to this last one being \"normal\" again (whatever that is), so that I could just rest for 4 days.  Guess who found out yesterday that my youngest has the day off school the day after chemo for a teachers' only day AND my husband is going on a business trip as well?  (DH has offered to cancel the business trip, but he rarely has them and it's an important one.)  I have bitten the bullet and invited my son's best friend over for the Friday as well (since his mum is a teacher and will be struggling to figure otu what to do with him on a day when she's at school)--at least it reduces the odds of me yelling at my boy when I'm feeling awful!  I'll take steroids one last time to help me get through it, I guess, plus increasing my patronage of Coca Cola Corporation.  (Just keep saying, \"Last one, last one, last one\" (of the icky ones anyhow!))

It's lovely to hear how people are doing after that charming experience we all started back in January.    I got very anxious a couple of months ago as the anniversaries started ticking by, starting at the end of August when I found my lump.  My surgery was early November, so I'm past all the anniversaries I care about now  and I truly feel like that whole experience was in the past. I feel like I'm pretty much back to normal, and when people ask how I am (using THAT tone of voice.  (\"No, REALLY, how are you?\")), it's lovely to say, \"It's all behind me now, and I'm fine.\"  And then I knock on wood, cross my fingers, and say a quick prayer to the Saint for Not Tempting Fate. My hair is still very short, but it's very thick again, which is lovely.  I missed it.  My eyebrows and eyelashes seem to have missed the news that it's safe to come back, and they're very sparse and utterly uncommitted to staying, but I'm hoping time will fix that.  And if not, I'm now FABULOUS with an eyebrow brush! Enough adults have asked me if I'm planning to keep my hair this short, (\"It REALLY suits you!!\") that I am getting a weird suspicion that waistlength scraggly hair wasn't the best look on a 46 year old.  I'll try keeping it short for a while and see how I go.  It doesn't feel like me yet to have short hair.  (Although bald didn't feel much like me either, so I shouldn't complain!) I'm a bit more nervous about my fingernails.  They all turned brown, but didn't fall off, with the Taxol.  Then the brown bits separated and I got white, hollow spaces under each nail, of varying size.  They're pretty much gone, except for my middle fingers, where I still have these large half-moons of white extending way down into the nail which are persistenly NOT growing out.  Much as I've loved having a great excuse to have my nails done every week for the past 5 months, the novelty (and the budget) have worn thin and I'd like to go back to being just me.  My daughter (who is 11) is very conscious of my nails and prefers them covered (even though she was fine with me wandering around bald), but she's just going to have to cope.  I really hope my fingernails get with the programme and start growing properly soon.  If not, they can be a lovely conversation starter.  (And then the conversation will end abruptly and awkwardly. That's always fun.  :-) Has anyone else made Serious Life Changes as a result of the cancer?  I quit my volunteer work (which had been 20-30 hours a week), despite being warned not to make Serious Life Changes during chemo, but it has been fabulous.  I keep thinking that I ought to miss it, but I don't miss it, not one little bit.  I find that weird, since it was pretty much my life for the past 10 years, and am a wee bit nervous that I'll wake up one of these days saying, \"What have I DONE?!?!\", but so far I'm loving the freedom and the spare time and the ability to slowly but surely tidy up a house, garage, and garden that were attacked by toddlers 13 years ago and have never recovered.    In general, I've found that I'm happy to toss tons of stuff that I've literally kept for decades.  No idea why the stuff mattered to me before and doesn't now, but I'm throwing it out before I change my mind. :-) I'm 3 months into Tamoxifen now, with no real side effects besides strong fatigue.  I suspect my husband thinks I'm grumpy, but it's hard to say if that's the Tamox, since I'm so tired so much of the time.  Still trying to calibrate my activities and interests so I can get to bed at whatever silly time of evening my body wants me to.  So far am not having much luck. 1 down, 19boxes of pills to go. I've been fretting a bit about followups lately.  My surgeon plans for me to have no imaging at all, for surveillance, which I can understand, given that I've had a double Mx, but I managed to get cancer in the first place AFTER the double Mx, so I'm not wild on no imaging.  (Let's be honest, I'd like to start every day with an MRI, just in case.)  Had a wildly unsatisfactory appt with his intern a few weeks ago, (where the poor intern could only repeat what the surgeon had told him to say), and am meeting with the surgeon himself on Monday.  It's frustrating to me that the followups here are with the surgeon, but we are very short of oncologists.  Wish me luck! Ooh look at that, I rambled all over creation again.  She's baaaaaack! Please post, everyone else!   MM, who is going to have a lat reconstruction, but probably not for at least 6 months, which gives me time to decide whether I'd rather live without the lat or without the breast.",

I don't know whose pain will be worse when I make the kids start it all up again, theirs or mine. Do you teach regular or Suzuki?) I have read that some exercise, no matter how small, is really important every day.  Even a walk around the block (or around the house) will help with the next day's energy. When things were worst, I tried to calibrate the exercise according to whether it was a day when I could just collapse all day afterwards, or whether I'd be expected to be interacting with humans. :-) (This morning my class had 52 people in it.  Public holidays are fun.  At least as I was pretty well UNDER the stage, the instructor couldn't see me wimping out.  (My excuse was that it was my first class in the wig and I was terrified of losing it.)) I haven't shaved, but am thinking of it.  I got the #4 buzz, which was fabulous while I had hair, but now I'm halfway between \"advanced mange\" and \"Hallowe'en skull\".  (Did you know that heads covered in thick hair don't tan?)  I've thought of shaving the stragglers off, but am afraid that when those follicles let go it will just be itchy while the follicle stubs try to climb out. (I'm afraid it will be like the ingrowing from shaving my legs, only worse, since if I scratch this part of my body in public, the way it looks now, grown men will pale and children will scream.) Have worked out that turbans and hats aren't for me.  Funny how personal a choice it is.  I've been wearing a scarf over a turban (since the turban is comfy and it isn't its fault that I feel hideous in it) and it gives some extra volume.  My wig is lovely and I've received lots of compliments on it, but it's a teeny bit small (I have been told in the past that I have a fat head--was that really what they meant?) and I'm afraid that if I move the wrong way, the wig will edge its way towards the middle and ZINGGG! off into space.  May have to work on strategies for that. I'm paranoid that if I wear a hat, I will forget that I have no hair and will take it off, leading to the aforementioned swooning of women and screams of infants. So scarfs it is for now! Webu, I am totally with you on the being expected to be perky thing.  I do not understand how anyone gets into the whole pink thing and puts on the tshirts and signs up for runs and dragon boat races.  Maybe because I'm an introvert?  I love talking to you guys like this, but I do not find anything to be cheerful about this disease about, and turning it into some sort of cheerleaders' pep rally doesn't work for me.  (I'm glad that there are people it works for--I'm just clearly not one of them!)   Melissa, I am SO glad your tumour is shrinking.  May it vanish completely by the end of chemo!  JulieH (and everyone else struggling) PLEASE hang in there.  I remember 22 years ago, my mum (Dx w stage IV ovarian cancer--that's how we found BRCA1, our unwelcome family guest!) saying that she would rather die then and there than go through the rest of her chemo.  But she did, and then did 2 more rounds (including a very early trial of Taxol, which I have always felt very fondly towards, as I feel likeit gave me an extra year of having my mum). It is SO worth it to our families to stick this out.  I keep telling myself that if I mum could do it (and she knew it wasn't going to save her life), then I can.  Of course that's easy to say for me, as I haven't been run over by a bus with it.   MM, planning to fast, starting tomorrow, so I'm \"anti-fasting\" today.  (Where is the chocolate?!?)",

I'm also about to start using tape on the wig, I think.  Has anyone tried one of those gel rings that headcovers.com sells?  I like the idea of them, but they look, with those wires (?) inside, like I'll also be able to receive radio signals on them--are they as uncomfortable as they look?  Or should I just stick with wig tape?  I like the idea of using something like the gel ring with scarves too, as I currently do worry about the scarf slipping, and me going, without noticing, from Grandma Babushka to Night Of The Living Dead at the supermarket.  Might clear the queues at the checkout though!",

(I realize that isn't a high bar to cross, given what the top of my head looks like at the moment!)  For those with sore heads (physically, not the kind my kids accused me of thsi morning), I've heard that Bonjela (yes, the stuff used for babies who are teething) is really great at soothing the irritation.  (Revised worry--if we start sprouting teeth up there that would be worse than a beard.) Today is my birthday (47!) and once again I declared my descent into decay by carefully dressing in the dark, gathering my keys, and dashing out to a gym class utterly bald.  (\"The Elephant Returns\" would be the title of the sequel to that, as I attempt to quietly slip upstairs and find the possum in the dark.  I didn't wake anyone on my original evacuation, but they were all up by the time I left the second time.  Why should they sleep if I am having to exercise anyhow?  They should have been up making me cupcakes! Blowing up balloons!  Making origami birthday cakes!) Today I'm off to Look Good, Feel Better and I'm very much looking forward to it.  I've decided that there are lots of things about this Cancer Thing that I really don't mind these days.  Silly things, but real ones.  For instance I could NEVER relax before.  I had 9000 things happening, and my idea of relaxing with a book involved a laptop in one hand, the book in the other, a phone on my armrest, a cup of tea which I'd drink and refill 85 times, a few snacks, better check on the laundry while I'm up, what are the kids up to anyhow, oops, time to start dinner!  Now I lie down and don't move for hours.  I watched 3 consecutive episodes of THE WEST WING in bed last night, perfectly guilt free and then read 3 chapters of THE POWER OF NOW.  Not a washing machine check in sight. I'm also finding that I'm more in touch with my emotional self (as opposed to my hyper-academic, rational self) and it's something that I'm working at consciously (since my hyper-academic self is very aware of the research on suppressing emotions and cancer).  It is so cool to have permission to think about how I'm feeling at a deep level and to deal with that, without apology or excuses.   I know we're supposed to Have Goals During Cancer, as though if we don't aspire to climb Everest we'll Lose The Will To Live, but I'm really happy to have my main goal to be to relax and get to know my inner self better.  Of course, that gets easier as my inner and outer self continue to expand!  (Thanks, Mr Steroids!) (Notice that I blame the steroids, not the 4 pieces of brownie I had for breakfast.  (It was warm!  It didn't turn out well and would be wasted!  It's my birthday! (Note to self: need new excuses for tomorrow!))) What are the positives that the rest of you have found?  It has been amazing to me just how many there are (amidst the not quite as positive things too!)",

Was utterly shocked when on days 20 and 21 after AC#2, I needed naps.  I guess they're not making it up and this stuff is cumulative! BTW, I'm Day 3 after AC#3/4 (3 weekly) +taxol/carboplatin (12xweekly) Serious new problem after AC#3:  I have no neck.  And I'm bald(ish).  I now look like Danny DeVito.  I know the weight gain isn't our focus, but yikes!  I've gained about 6 pounds and am NOT HAPPY! Second serious problem is the worst memory ever.  Chemobrain came crashing down on me a few days ago out of the blue and now I'm forgetting children at events, forgetting half the meal I'm making, etc.  Forgot that I was grilling peppers in the oven the other day and went out for coffee with the griller on full blast.  (We finished the coffee in my house, just grateful it hadn't burned to the ground, accompanied by the gentle scent of carbonized peppers.)   Yesterday was day 2 and I went to the gym at the crack of dawn (since I didn't sleep that night of course) and used a treadmill (which I do on rare occasions,but not often.)  Thanks to Mr Steroids, I was like Wonder Woman.  Just kept going and going and going and going, and thinking that I'd stop soon, but no, I kept going.  Then I didn't crash when I got home either. Felt way better than I had after AC#2--didn't use any metaclopramide at all, which is new.  Had a fabulous day, aside from some fatigue, and kept thanking the Decadron all day.  Till it came to bedtime pill-time and I realized I hadn't taken any.  Oops.  Can you have placebo effect without the placebo? (I did get tons during the chemo, so some must have lasted, but still...) Am now seriously torn.  I feel 100% better than last time, and am convinced that the steroids were causing half my weirdness, yet I don't like to not take things I'm told to take.  Unfortunately it's Saturday, so I'm on my own advice-wise.  Maybe I'll call the ward at the hospital.  Everyone says the steroids are just for energy and anti-nausea, so I can't see the harm in not taking them...(I am such a nightmare patient.)  A funny coincidence is that my 6 mo puppy was fixed yesterday and she's on the same medication schedule as I am with the ondansetron/Zoloft.  No chance of me forgetting hers. (Unless I forget mine of course!) (And it's 9am of day 3 and I have no breakthrough nausea at all, and the last pill I took was at 6pm last night.  Weird.) Oh, and I didn't fast this time.  Just my luck--I'll be the only person alive for whom fasting made the SE worse! Have been reading this group closely and am so glad that so many of us are nearly done with the first round, esp those who have had the really nasty SE.  Add me to those whose hair has kept growing.  I lost NONE in round 2 of the AC, so I still look almost-but not quite bald.  The #4 has grown out to a #9 or something and I look like I'm on the way to a combover (see, just like Danny DeVito!) but I like the fuzzy feel so I'm not shaving it. I hope everyone has a good weekend!   MM, off for a walk in the hills, a grocery expedition, then I'll redeem a few more nap certificates!",

Annie, I think that you and I were making chocolate chip cookies at the same time. :-) I hope you're feeling better. Glad to hear it went so well today, Allison.  It's nice when they make an effort to make the first one pleasant. bdavis,  I'm with you on and Sue on the hair thing.  I didn't try to get a matching wig, but waiting is driving me mad.  I had heard days 11-12 with AC, but I'm on day 10 now and my hair is much more firmly attached than it was 5 days ago (when there was a weird give to it when I pulled hairs out <shiver>).  I am glad that my camping trip tomorrow (one night in a cabin on a tiny island in the middle of Wellington Harbour) is unlikely to involve a wig, as the winds here are fierce and I was afraid it would come off in the boat!  I think that working out what will work for you is really important--hang in there till it feels right! Kym, how is your infection today?  That's the last thing you need right now! Tammy, sorry to hear about the nausea meds.  I had a similar experience with painkillers after my reconstruction and I now have \"Not Being A Heroine\" tattooed to my forehead, just in case I forget. Glad the meds kicked in quickly! MM, spending the day NOT with my team at their meeting, but sitting at home cooking with the kids.  (Mr 7yo is cooking a chicken dinner \"all by himself\".)

Beckie, Sorry to hear that work was so hard.  It does sound like day 5 might be a good day to stay home and sleep next time.  How did wig shopping go? baf4292, I so agree about the nausea.  I remember that from pregnancy--the more tired I am, the more nauseated.  I'm really worried about tomorow (day 2), when my husband will be at work and it is the last day of the summer holidays for my kids.  I'm going to take them to a movie in the morning, and just hope they don't drive me nuts by dinnertime.  (And we're ordering in for dinner!)  My husband is trying to step up to the mark, but I'm trying to hang on as long as possible--by the end of 6 months of chemo that's when he'll need to be using up his leave to help me! Julie, I had no idea that the Pacific NW knew Nanaimo Bars (although it makes since since Nanaimo is on Vancouver Island).  They are really common throughout most of Canada--most cafes will have them (along with butter tarts and doughnuts of course--did you know that per capita Canadians eat ten times as many doughnuts as Americans?  My kids thought they'd died and gone to heaven when we visited Toronto and they saw 3 doughnut shops on every corner!) AimeeMac, I LOVE what your friend said about us being replaceable at work but not to our families.  That is so utterly true, but it had never occurred to me before.  Duh.

I had a BMX (supposedly prophylactically, but BRCA1 had other ideas) 4 years ago, with a free TRAM reconstruction.  I was very very happy with it.  I loved waking up from the surgery not flat, I loved having my own tissue, with natural jiggling, not having to do fills or worry about replacing foreign objects, and I was just more comfortable with being all me.  I also loved the feel and shape of my new breasts.  And the tummy tuck was awesome! The surgery was long (about 8 hours) and the recovery was huge.  Two weeks of being hunched over (via the tummy tuck), 4 weeks of having no stamina and no real ability to do much, another month or two of being very tired (and I stayed off my work in a preschool for the whole10 week term).  It was about 6 months before I was totally back to myself, but I was back to being able to do anything (just not much at a time) after about 4-6 weeks. Full arm mobility took a long time--probably over a year.  Still can't sit up without using my hands or rocking. I figure that just lets me off doing situps! My husband helpfully had surgery on his knee when I was three weeks post surgery, so for 2 days I had to do everything at home and I ended up with an antibiotic-resistant infection for which I still sport the scar.

I felt my cancer.  It was a lump right in the middle, by my sternum (which is why I'm so keen to get the nodes there irradiated--they can't examine them surgically because the ribcage is in the way).  You'd hardly have thought breast tissue went that far into the middle (which is probably why it was left behind in the mastectomies). My tumour scar is less than an inch from my sternum. (So much for scoop-necked or v-necked tops for me!)  My oncologist says (and what I've read agrees) that MRI is the most reliable way to do surveillance after mx.  I had a CT after the cancer was diagnosed and it didn't pick up my tumour, even though the referral identified it! And mammograms work best on breast tissue because of the density (or lack) of the tissue.  The trick is the frequency and convincing those that pay for them that it's worth it. When surgeons do a mastectomy, they work very very hard to scrape off every last breast tissue cell they can possibly get, so many do feel that there is little point in surveillance, as you have to spend huge sums of money to detect even one cancer (since the cancers are relatively rare).  I dont' know how that works for those of us who have proven that we get breast cancer already. :-) My neutrophils went down to 1, or 1.1 after each chemo too.  I'd never heard of losing brows and lashes AFTER taxol.  Hardly seems fair.  I might go and tape mine on right now!   MM, also about to start insisting on getting CA125 tests done again since my risk of ovarian cancer is the same as my (theoretical) risk of breast cancer was, and I'm a lot more nervous about ovarian CA!",

Aimster,  BodyPump and other exercise has been a lifeline for me through this.  I really notice it on the days that I don't get decent exercise--except that normally \"decent\" exercise has been a short run or 25 minutes of weights.  I tend to do a small number of heavy reps, and I WAAAAY overestimated how much I'd be able to handle in BodyPump!  I do plan to go back, but I don't know when or whether I'll have any weight on the bar!  In the meantime, back to BodyBalance (do you guys call it BodyFlow?) and running and free weights. :-)  I was very proactive on the wig front.  I knew that my hair would come out eventually, and because I have been waiting for a long while for my onco appt and was afraid that the summer/Christmas holidays would affect it, I got in early.  (Here 2/3 of people take their vacation in January, and Wellington isn't very big and there's only one real place to get a wig--and as it turns out, the lady who does it was going to be away for most of Jan, so i'm glad I got it when I did.  I've got waist length, very thick hair, and getting a wig that would suit me mattered a lot to me, partly because I've tried short hair before and never had any luck (just looked like an electrified bush, due to the hair thickness), and partly because my Mum (also BRCA1, died of OVCA 17 years ago) looked like she was wearing a dead muskrat and I was keen to avoid that option.   Had a helpful friend (very very VERY analytic type, bordering on aspie) tell me that hair loss \"doesn't matter\" because the effect is \"only psychological\".  She was trying to be helpful, so I didn't get into it with her, but I know that for me, the hair loss is going to be a big deal.  I really like my hair!  Aimster, my oopherectomy was really no big deal.  I had a month or two of waking up sweating and that was absolutely it.  Iwas really really lucky.  I did a low dose of HRT for about 9 months (after consulting right left and centre about it and finally deciding that the impact of menopause on my bones would be the key factor) and am now wondering if that is why the cancer is ER+, which is not common for BRCA1 types.  (Of couse the side question is whether it would have emerged at all without it, but if that level and duration of HRT gave me cancer in the teeny number of breast cells I had left, then I was doomed anyhow!)    Am definitely getting nervous.  My chemo starts on Thursday (AC) and on Sunday, my two younger children (7 and 10) are going away to camp for the first time (a 45 minute drive away through the mountains) AND I've been offered the chance to sing a solo at church on Sunday morning.  What were the odds, eh?

I'm taking a \"targetted activities\" approach--working out what I HAVE to do in a given day (like picking my kids up from camp today, and going to a 6am gym class) and then I fit everything else around it.  Some days that has meant multiple short naps, some days it has meant one long nap, and some days I've just not managed anything else except the things I really needed to do.

Melissa, if the bone aches are from Neulasta, some find Claritin helpful.  I hope you find something good for you. slcst, I love that bracelet idea.  I have been wandering around saying, \"1 down, 7 to go\" and feel very pleased (until I remember what the last 3 reps feel like in a gym class :-)  JulieH, I am really struggling with how much to slow down.  I have to say, I don't see this as a speed bump, as some advise people like me with early stage BC to regard it.  Because I'm BRCA1 and because both my mum and my aunt died at around my age, I feel like I need to give it ALL my attention and do every trivial thing I can to increase my chances.  (I have a baby brother and 2 cousins who went totally off the rails (as in ruined adulthoods now, 20 years later--one now moving into a second generation of it) from losing their mums as teenagers.  (I was 29, but my brother was only 17), so I am obsessed with doing everything I can.) So I'm feeling like rest and exercise and diet, really the only things available for me to do right now, need to be my full focus, and I'm reluctant to take on any commitments that I'll have difficulty dropping if I need to.  I feel like a complete slacker, though, which isn't helping. I'm a SAHM with a big volunteer job (national VP of an early childhood service with 500 centres) and I hate letting people down, but I find I just can't care about doing the work at the moment. I feel like my important job is recovery, and it's irresponsible of me to take on other things that will make that harder (i.e. to fulfill my spontaneous desires for naps :-)  Then I look at all of you out there, working through chemo, and feel like a dilettante.  (Or would if I could spell it.)  I'm normally the sort of person who is up to my eyeballs in everything (I'm also on 5 committees at church, sing in the choir, am a trustee for our school's board, and run adult education workshops), so figuring out what I should be doing and how much I should be doing, and not losing my self-esteem (or dying of boredom, once my initial drive to research everything in sight is fulfilled) in the process is a huge issue for me. But at the same time I will hate it if I struggle to keep up with things that aren't always fun in the first place (Ooh, can I write up minutes of my subcommittee meeting, please?) and then get a recurrence.  The world will not end if I am not in the centre of it.  Or will it? Sorry for going on so long, but I'd love to hear how the rest of you are managing this and how you are feeling about it (bearing in mind that we are all coming from very different places).   MM, who would possibly feel less like a woman on a mission had I not already had the preventative double mx 4 years ago and then still managed to get cancer.  (If IT is on a mission, then *I* can be on a mission!) I'd love to know how the rest of you are handling it. (And I have to say, I'm not obsessing over dying etc etc.  I",

On the BRCA websites there is a lot of discussion about options, but the research is solid--that the results that work best for people are the ones that feel right for THEM--and it's different for everyone.  No matter what the choice is, if it doesn't feel right, it is likely to not work well.  Good luck with the choices!    MM< waaaay behind so many of you, with 10 Taxol/carbo left, then rads (then AIs for years...)",

Yes, I've found the combination of carboplatin and taxol quite a rough one.  I only get carbo every 3 weeks, luckily, but the last one was a weekend when my DH went over to Australia for his sister's 50th, so he was gone the whole weekend, and the one before was Easter weekend (and being Catholic, (and I'm a soloist in the choir), it's a biiiiig weekend for us. So I've spent lots of time strugglign to get through those and then collapsing once it was allowed again. I do feel a wee bit like a 1940s MGM child star--caffeine to get me moving, drugs to help me sleep.  Drugs for my tummy, drugs for the itching!  The NZ pharmaceutical industry (and Coca Cola Amatil) will collapse when I'm done chemo! I've had some excitement.  I got to use my litte \"Neutropenic Fever Alert!\" card when I got a fever of 38.7 (101.6) a couple of weeks ago.  My favourite part was when the triage nurse took my temperature, looked at my file online, then stepped to a microphone and bellowed \"CODE TWO IN ROOM 4! CODE TWO IN ROOM 4!\" I felt very special.  Sadly, that was the extent of the drama.  No source of infection was found, and they sent me home (at 11pm, without a car) after they'd done the IV antibiotics.  (My least favourite part was where I spent 75 minutes feeling utterly miserable in the waiting room AFTER presenting my little card.  However, I'm told that Reception Is To Be Re-educated on what those cards mean.) I got a less exciting fever last week (100.5) and ignored it (since DH was going to his sister's birthday the next morning and I was afraid he'd stay home if I was being all Chemo Drama Queen.)  Unfortunately I mentioned it to a nurse at chemo the next week and YIKES did I get my head ripped off.  I won't ignore any such thing again, I promise.  (She had a patient with a similar fever die on her once.  She had been waiting 2 hours till her husband came home from work so he could watch the kids.) I had an interesting experience about 10 days ago.  When I went in for chemo (this was the day I got the mild fever and didn't tell) my immune stuff was low, so I got the Neupogen shots (called G-CSF here--why use a word, if you can use a random string of letters?).  Has anyone else found that the shots affected their energy levels?  By the day of the last shot, I had tons and tons more energy than beforehand. I was making proper dinners, doing laundry--all sorts of things that previously I'd just thought about, then gone for a nap.  Nothing else changed in that time--no transfusion, no hearty eating of liver (yuck!), and I know that going into the shots my hemoglobin was very low --but it was at the end too.  THe only change was neutrophils and WBC, which both shot way up. (Neutrophils have been in the 0.5 - 2.0 range for 4 months, but were 5.5 last week.) I'm back to low energy again, but I was very grateful for my week of feeling like Superwoman. (I think my husband was too.  The kids less so, since takeaway and hot dogs featured less prominently.)  (Funny how you don't trust yourself though--today I look at the work I should do and jsut want a nap, but despite how much I did in the last week, the voice in my head isn't saying \"You're not very well\", it's saying \"You're being lazy!\" I'm a bit sad this week.  Last weekend was my preschool's annual conference and I stepped down from my role as national VP.  It was definitely the right decision (mostly because I am SO over going away every 3rd or 4th weekend--not that I have been lately), but I'm now in that crisis of identity that comes from no longer being able to say, \"Yes, I'm at home, but I'm in full time volunteer work.  Well, <cough, cough>, I'm national vice president of the New Zealand Playcentre Federation.  Why yes, we do have 500 licensed centres!\" Now I get to say, \"I'm a housewife!\" (And judging from the state of the house, not a very successful one!) It was a wonderful conference, and I got the kind of magnificent send-off that you only get when secretly people are worried that you're quitting because you're dying (I wanted to wear a placard that said \"Stage IIa\", but that wouldn't have meant much).  And I was lucky that my energy lasted throughout it.  And I'll still be in touch via facebook, but I'm a bit lost this week, just the same! So there you go, I'm still here, just lurking (and being jealous of all you that are done chemo.)  I finish on June 16th, and will be very glad of it!   MM, whose wig has gone into rehab, since it was turning into a very mangy Possum.",

I just got a phone call from my dentist's receptionist, saying, \"We were just wondering if you were coming in for your hygenist appointment this morning?\"  to which the answer was, \"Actually, no.\" (I didn't receive the booking notice, but normally I'd leap in the car and head straight over, full of apologies.  Not today however!  Oops.  This is called \"Playing the Cancer card\", my children!)   MM, who did buy groceries (since DH, while expert at feeding the family all weekend, wasn't so expert at finding the grocery store on the weekend), but I had to sit down 4 times while putting them away.  I am a precious, fragile little princess, I am. :-) P.S.  So very glad to hear of all the positive news and those finishing chemo.  Very glad that your mammogram was normal, AimeeMac!

Julie, that's no good at all that your husband's cancer has come back!  (You guys are sure keeping up the workload on your oncologist, aren't you?)  I'll say a prayer that the excision does the trick. Nothing exciting here.  I'm well and fit and happy (and doing insane amounts of travel, due to winning a prize of zillions of free flights.  Ten years ago I'd have been prudent and sensible and blown it all on one big trip (we have to still pay for accommodation etc--just the flights are free) but instead, having a much clearer \"shall not pass this way again\" voice in my head, we are having lots of teeny yet long-haul trips (3 days in Beijing anyone?)  We will still be eating cat food in our retirement, but not to the same degree as if we hadn't won the flights, so it's all good. I am struggling terribly with chemo brain still.  Anyone else?  I went back to university this (calendar) year, and nearly lost my mind trying to study in June.  Aside from playing whack-a-mole with people who cluelessly try to tell me that it's just middle age (and HOW would they know unless they can get into my brain?) I haven't found any helpful approach to it yet.  Have done some reading and Ritalin looks worth a try, but my surgeon (who is my point of call for after-care) and my GP clearly think that the cancer has addled my brain in other ways.  (C'mon guys, if I wanted serious drugs, Ritalin is not where I would start!  As well, I have a bedroom drawer with enough sleeping pills to make me Rip van Winkle.  (Hmm, maybe I should find a more secure place for them.)) Chemo brain increases with chemo dosage (and I got AC+Taxol+ carboplatin as well) AND Tamoxifen (tick there too!) so it looks like this is long term/permanent and I really would like to find some relief! Would love to hear if any of the rest of you have experienced this (before I go and hang out on a forum actually intended for that conversation). I hope you're all doing well, MaryMeg. ",
