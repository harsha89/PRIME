I went home with a drain which was removed yesterday. Since the surgery from my armpit to my wrist on the underside of my arm is very painful and tight. I am unable to straighten my arm fully or rotate it or raise it above shoulder level without a lot of pain. It is not swollen at all but very sore. I tried to pick up my sons toy and dropped it, I lost all strength in my hand. The surgeon said this is normal and told me exercises to do. Has anyone else experienced this? Do you think it is just from the surgery or could this be the start of Lymphedema? I am looking for a pt who is LE certified but would appreciate any advice from anyone who has experienced the same issues following surgery. I have surgery again next week to get my port inserted and I would like to be feeling better before I go through surgery again. Also any info on how port insertion goes would be appreciated as well. Thanks so much! Sandy Dx 8/22/2011, IDC, 2cm, Stage IIIA, Grade 3, 4/14 nodes, ER+/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

Surgeries were very delayed due to extensive flooding , I am in the northwest suburbs of Philly. I did end up with lots of nodes involved, hubby doesn't remember how many he was told by Dr. but enough that I left with a drain. I am very sore mostly from the node removal but I am glad to be done. Hopefully Dr. got clear margins. I hope everyone who also had their surgeries today recover quickly. Thanks to everyone for their kind words and encouragement.",

I am also a nervous wreck but I am relieved to finally get this process started. The waiting was hard for me. I know I have a long road ahead of me but I am glad to have begun my journey to survival. I wish you both an uneventful surgery and an easy recovery. Best Wishes. Sandy",

      "Content": "SStayton wrote: I am 34 and I was diagnosed 2 weeks ago with IDC, at least stage 2 because the lump is between 2.4cm on ultrasound and 2.8cm on mammo. The doctor sent me for additional tests, Chest Xray, Bone Scan both were neg. (yeah), and an MRI. I got the MRI results today and I am concerned because in addition to the lump I knew about, they measured it at 2.6cm, the report said there is an additional 2 cm mass superior and posterior which is presumably an abnormal lymph node/s.They also explained the two masses as behaving the same as far as enhancement and such. Does this indicate that the cancer has spread to my nodes? Has anyone had abnormal lymph nodes on MRI that ended up being normal? I am still waiting for more pathology on receptors and tumor grade as well as genetic testing. I meet with med. onc. and rad. onc and breast surgeon on tues, I am just trying to be as prepared and informed as possible. Any advice or info. will be greatly appreciated. I don't have any family or friends with BC experience so I am hoping I might find the answers I need here.

Grade 3 in every area, so I guess the tumor is worrisome. I have had clear bone scans and chest x ray, but was not given a PET scan, is that normal? I am going to ask my MO next time I see her, maybe they are waiting until chemo is done?? Any thoughts or anyone in the same situation... Thanks for any advice.  Sandy",
