Hope to have LN results tmw/Fri, but dependent on Holiday! My 3 drs (and I) are very positive that I will only need Tomoxifen; no chemo/radiation.   I have been very lucky, all 3 docs (family, general surgeon, plastic surgeon) have been upfront w/me from day one, often answered my list of ???s before I cd ask, and have been so very supportive. My family phs called me every day after 11/17 to \"chat\" w/me, gave me her home ph# in case I needed to talk, & her cell phone when she went to Hawaii for 5 days! Also left a message from Hawaii that she was thinking of me!! Although not wanting it, I went into surgery very positive. Waiting for DX, I researched everything I could, and did feel Mast was the right choice.   You'rr right about Pagets - very little info, contacts - & everyone I talked to had never heard of it. Had all kinds of people researching it!! My doc suspected it the minute she looked @ my nipple. The reason for the mastec was calcifications thru/out the milk ducts.   I got info today about \"Aromatase Inhibitors Better than Tamoxifen Ager Surgery for Early-Stage BC\", so will talk w/them about it. I've talked w/several BC survivors who have been very positive about Tamox, but if anyone has info/ideas I'd love to hear.   Most of the time I'm \"UP\", but am trying to accept the grief stages I go thru various times. I've not yet really looked at my reconstruction, but I opened the 'bra' a little the other day to clean up a little. I saw just a little of the area and really lost it. My hubby was there helping me, and hugged me for the longest time til I felt better. I'm sure that tmw when the drains are removed, I'll get  a full view and am really scared & the tho't of it makes me shake all over. I have lots of 'self talk': Hah, you've been cast out damn spot; it could be worse; blah, blah.   I'm scared, worried, concerned about the reconstruction over the next few months & will should feel a little better w/results from lymph nodes. I do have lots of family/friend/coworker support. This is my first time in a chat room, but th't it might help me get thru this & hopefully I can be of help to all you.   My son gave me a pink hat for Christmas & told me \"when you feel down, put this on to remember you're a cancer survivor\". Little things like that help me smile.   I look forward to hearing from you.    ",
