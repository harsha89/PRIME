He didn't elaborate but organised for me to have a CT CAP first thing tomorrow morning. Last week I went to the GP because I have been nauseous and pain under right ribs. My blood test came back liver function is ok but on exam my liver is enlarged. Last year I had a CT and it showed \"severe hepatic stetanosis \", this wasn't noticed by GP until this latest issue. My question is does the elevated markers mean I have mets of some sort.  I hope someone may be able to shed some light on this. Thanks Jennie",

I see my oncologist on Thursday for the results, so I don't have long to wait. This is so much quicker than the original diagnosis. Thanks Jennie",
