      "Content": "nurseiam wrote: I am scheduled for bilateral mastectomy with breast cancer on the left side. My ps said I have the option of keeping the nipple on the healthy side for the additional option of using nipple sharing to create a new nipple on the left side. She said the long term stats are the same between keeping the nipple or not. I will lose the left nipple for sure b/c the tumor is right under the aerola. My ps is highly skilled with micro-vascular surgery reconstruction. If I give up both nipples, I will have a clean slate for nipple reconstruction however my ps sad nipple sharing is an excellent option for a good cosmetic outcome. Any thoughts on nipple sharing from those who went through it?
