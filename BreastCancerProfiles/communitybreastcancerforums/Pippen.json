Was able to eat my normal breakfast, although tasted rather flat. Rinsing my mouth with salt/soda water every so often which helps with the burning sensation.  My normal sense has been to feel weak, but able to do most things, just not as long, feeling a little off, strange sensations. Feels weird to breathe deep, my lungs feel kind of strange, not sure if it is anything to worry about, so won't.  I have my sweet purring kitten sitting on my lap going to town to make me feel loved and wanted. Everyone else is busy today, so am home alone watching old movies and trying to stay positive. Tried posting the other day, but my computer disconnected just when I was ready to publish, so sorry for the lack of introduction. I will keep you all in my prayers as we walk through this together. Thanks for sharing your s/e and your experiences here. ",

A couple of new SE popped up this last week. One was my feet started itching suddenly, fortunately that lasted for a little over a half hour and then calmed down. My doctor said to use Benadryl if it happens again. Then the next evening my hands started itching... same thing. Another thing started, but has calmed down since I started my dexamethasone - I started having what felt like a bladder infection with the urge to urinate at the end of the stream, very uncomfortable. There was no urinary tract infection, so probably bladder irritation is the reason - again a SE from Cytoxan.  I take Ativan at night, cause it helps me sleep, especially the days on the cortisone, but also helps with nausea. Then I taper off taking it every other night until I can just sleep. I slept a lot last week. Tired, so tired... But able to walk a mile today without having to stop to rest. So it passes.  Thanks for all your input here, I enjoy reading it and seeing how everyone is doing. Have a happy New Year. ",

The taste buds still acting up, but I know they will return. Sounds like everyone is going through their own specific issues. Glad for so many of us that our chemo is through, now radiation ahead. I meet with my RO on Monday and then will know more specifically when radiation starts, I assume in 4-5 weeks from this week...that will be a change of pace. I'm also wondering if I will have any major side effects caused from radiation, but that should be explained next Monday. Am tired, and tired of being tired... working parttime through this whole time has helped I suppose. I am amazed at how many of us have mixed emotions about coming to the end of chemo. The unknown is known, so it is familiar, now we have to face a new unknown, radiation and tamoxifen or femora treatments another place to go. Knowing several women who have survived treatment for more than 10 years, I know that our lives will be different than what we knew before this started, and yet I believe better and more fulfilling. I look forward to making this year a new beginning as I have passed through the shadow of death - Blessings to all. Look forward to reading more postings in the future.",

When we finished up at Target and walked across the parking lot, thought I would get a bowl of soup at Panera bread, which sounded really good. Well I didn't get to eat it. I sat down to wait for the food to come, and proceeded to pass out! That was a surprise. I guess maybe I over did it? I don't know, there was no warning. Anyway my husand got my food and went and got the car and drove it right up to the door and when I was ready to stand up and walk, I got in the car and went home... so much for going out to eat soup! :-) I'm home fine, just tired and feeling shaky.",

Felt pretty good 2nd and 3rd week after treatment, went back to work and could almost walk my normal pace. Cut off the hair on Wednesday and my hubby joined me, now we have shaved heads together! Too funny. The scalp was sore as many of you report and still is with the stubble, but this too shall pass...  I now have 4 wigs, two bought, two given to me, one really funky (maybe I'll go as a gypsy on Halloween) 2 look almost like my hair, thankfully my hairdresser trimmed them up a bit so they looked more natural around my face.  Definitely take those wigs to a hairdresser who likes you! After treatment Thursday my husband and I went to this lovely boutique in Los Gatos called \"The Next Step\" and I purchased several head coverings, especially night caps and some cute hats. Am so glad I did, that way if I hate the wigs I will still have cute covers. I found several really cute caps at Target as others have mentioned here.  Good news my blood work was all within normal limits, so no shots of Neupogen for me this time around Thank you Jesus!  Had to give up a sweet little kitten that I just loved, but she was getting sick and even my vet was concerned for my health with her. She is safe, but I miss her purrs. My other cats don't miss her though.  Had second chemo Thursday this week and today the burning tongue sensation has returned as before, but I'm not as tired (since I didn't have surgery this time i think) I had a port put in the day before my first treatment and so I think that caused a lot of exhaustion and pain and feeling crumby that I'm not feeling as much tonight. But tomorrow may be a whole nuther story!  Got to go out and go to the International Gift Fair today - loved it, was so fun to shop for Christmas in an atmosphere of friends and something familiar to this time of year. So far noone was sneezing or anything so hopefully I am safe from harm.. ha ha who can tell. Found out that all my worrying about wearing masks was for nothing. My Onc told me that the surgeon masks that you buy in the store do not protect us from flu or colds because of the holes in the sides, but she did say there was a higher numbers type of face mask to wear, unfortunately I didn't write it down so i could remember what it was for future use. I will make a note to ask her again. I passed on the church social tonight though, figured I shouldn't push it in one weekend.  After the last treatment I went back to work and by the following Wednesday was so sick I stayed home, so this time am planning on staying home the first two days of next week and maybe go back on Wednesday for a half day... This will make it better I hope. Blessings to all you who are walking this walk and may your Sunday be a good one without too much pain and suffering. ",

The last treatment #3 was much harder on me, so didn't get much done around the house. But felt better yesterday and today. Regarding avoiding stores - since I live in California, not too much colds and flu noticeable yet. Plan on a trip to Disney soon just to enjoy the Christmas - low crowds during the week so will have fun even if I have to spend some of it in a wheelchair! Thanks for sharing all your posts... :-) Hope the holidays will cheer everyone up.",

Planning on a long nap this afternoon. Trying to get laundry done too. Some asked about work, I work 3 days a week, but the week after chemo I take Mon and Tue off and work a half day on Wed. Thus is isn't so hard. I don't envy you having a mastectomy in the middle of treatment, that would be so hard to face. I still have two more treatments to go, the week after Christmas will be getting number 5, and then one more in Jan - TC - so far not too much peripheral neuropathy, occasionally if I let my hands or feet get pinched from the way I'm sitting. I am noticing a significant dryness all over my extremities though - using lots of lotion after showers and in between, always putting lotion on. This week I celebrated my birthday with friends and found it hard to eat anything fun, chocolate cake didn't taste good, but the chocolate milkshakes from In & Out sure help. My day is expanding as the stomach is rebelling from whatever I had earlier today... Oh well... one more day down and hopefully by Thurs will feel closer to normal again. I find that the fresher the vegetables are and cooked, the more they taste like what they are, with an occasional exception. Fruit is a little more difficult to decide - I just put them in a shake so have a blend. Christmas will be done early for me this year as we celebrate on Sunday this week. Merry Christmas everyone blessings and peace to each of you as you continue to walk this walk of BC. ",
