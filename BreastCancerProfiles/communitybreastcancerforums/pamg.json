    "Content": "pamg wrote: I am working with a PT for AWS. She has done some manual work on my cords but she is now more focused on recommending a number of different compression garments for me to wear.  In particular, the Tribute sleeve by Solaris and another vest type garmet that will fit under my arm (where the cord is very thick). I can't seem to find anything on the web that talks about the effectiveness/necessity of using these types of garmets for AWS. Everything else seems to point to stretching and PT. Anyone have any experience with this?
