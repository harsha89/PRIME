I also wanted to clarify about the Glutamine treatment for swelling and skin irritation from radiation. Glutamine is an amino acid that is in powder form. Thirty grams are to be ingested daily divided into three 10 mg doses. It can be sprinkled on food or mixed in a beverage. Anyway I'm trying it and I'll post how it goesl. I also want to get some psychological help for anxiety, but can't decide on a psychiatrist, psychologist or social worker. If anyone has any thoughts on this I would welcome them.",

I'm pretty much just alternating them now. I only have 5 more boosts so I'm hoping to fend off any major skin breakdown. I'm looking forward to the weekend and seeing my son and pregnant (first grandchild) daughter-in-law. Hugs to all",

So far the skin is holding up well. I have been using a coat of Calendula cream first and then apply Aquaphor. I do this right after my treatment and then again at bedtime after a shower. After next week I start the boosts. I had a planning session today and will be prone for these treatments. My back is so marked up I feel like I was on an episode of SkinWars. One thing that has really helped are the integrative nurses here at the radiation center. Once a week I get a session with them for massage, healing touch, guided imagery and other healing therapies. It is a great feature to having treatment here Thanks to everyone for the sharing and encouragement. This is very therapeutic and informative.",
