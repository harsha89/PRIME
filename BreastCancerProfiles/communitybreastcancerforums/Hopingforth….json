I had to make that hard decision of whether or not I was going to keep the baby. It didnt even cross my mind that I wasnt going to go through with it. It was the best decision I ever made, He was born at 31 weeks after trying to stop labor twice. I went through chemo the whole time I was pregnant and think that is why he came early. He is beautiful and is still in the hospital ( hoping he comes home soon) . You can do it , and know you made the right decision!!",

I had my surgery at 14 weeks, and started chemo in my second trimester. I had my beautiful baby boy at 31 weeks. I then started chemo again 6 weeks later. I have just finished rads and finally getting my port removed tomorrow . I understand where you guys are coming from. I lived that very same life last year. I was also very scared of the outcomes. Chemo is doable, like above make sure to take the nausea meds, sleep lots, and drink lots. I understand how she feels about losing her hair, it is hard! I had two rounds of chemo before my hair started to fall out, and I would say the best thing to do is to not let it control you. I would just get a cute haircut that would match a wig that you would get. I bought a wig, and then had the hairdresser cut my own hair to the same style, so that way when it came to me having to wear my wig , nobody even noticed. I bought a real human hair wig, I found it was the best for me, as I could color it, blow dry it, curl it, what ever I wanted to do as you can treat it like your own hair. Everything will be ok, just breath and take one day at a time.!",

I myself had breast cancer and was diagnosed in 2011 with triple negative , I was also pregnant at the time . I have undergone chemo, rads, surgeries and honestly don't think I could of done it without her there , she was my rock and my go to person. She made me strong and confident that I was going to beat it and I did, and have tried to take every precaution I can to have it not come back. My mom wasn't that lucky and has had to fight since day one, the cancer was in her bones and so she was in constant pain and then my brother died last year from brain cancer and my dad died in May so she has not had a easy couple months especially her being told herself that there wasn't much they could do for her and she had maybe a year and they told her this only two months ago. I'm so glad to not see her in hat pain anymore and suffering everyday but I sure will miss her",

I kind of feel like I don't want to come back to this site because of negativity. If it is was cancer I wanted a mastectomy. I have small breasts and if she removed the lump then it would have been 1/2 of a mastectomy anyways. Very sad to hear people ripping on my doctor, when she just wanted to calm me down by having one surgery. Are people on this site anti-mastectomy???",

Well now I received a call from the radiation nurse two months after my last tx that I need to come in discuss rads ! What??? Now I feel overwhelmed all over again , I thought I was getting on with my life and trying to fix the damage but now told this, I said to her I didn't think I was having rads done and she said well just come in and talk about that, I feel so confused now and feel am I doing all I'm suppose to do to fight this disease?
