    "Content": "Nov 28, 2010 11:51AM - edited Aug 20, 2013 03:17AM by lizoly I finished chemo on September 9th. The neuropathy in my feet has been the most painful. Exercise and lots of water seem to help. I've been taking generic Neurontin called Gabapentin for about three weeks now.  I have not noticed any side effects and it has reduced the pain in my feet somewhat.  My feet still hurt most of the time so I'm still exploring other remedies.  My onc says it should continue to get better over the next 6 months or so.  I\"ve also tried Acupunture which hasn't helped much. ",
