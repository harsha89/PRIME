You guys really have some great ideas for wearing LE garments.  I think I'll check into some of those for myself.  Thx.",

Breast/truncal LE is supposed to be rather difficult to diagnose and you may want to use some compression.  If mine is bothering me I'll sleep in an Ahhh bra for a few days and I'll also insert something to help when wearing a bra, including a Swell Spot I bought from Lymphedema Products but you'll not want to do anything until you get directions from your therapist as we're all different in how the LE affects us.  I'm going to try the Ledder or something like that (not sure what it's called) treatments that we can find online on youtube.  They say it helps.  Kira and Binney are the experts here on LE and can help you with most any question.  They're very kind and supportive and know more than anyone about our problem.  Good luck.  I'll be anxious to hear what your therapist says. ",

I'm to go back to regular rads tomorrow but I don't think my clavicle area can take it - I'm so itchy, red and inflamed.  Even my prescription cream isn't doing the itching trick this time.  It worked really well on my chest.  I feel like taking some drug to take my mind off the itchy feeling but know that everything has to be cleared by the RO so can't.  wah wah wah",

It's funny but I have friends who look at me and tell me how much they love my hair and seem so surprised by their own statements. I even have people I don't know tell me what beautiful hair I have and how lucky I am to have just the right amount of curls. I never know what to say and have a hard time responding but inside I'm thinking of the strangers' comments like \"If you only knew what I had to go through to get this\". Someday I'll get up the nerve to ask my friends why they stare so much. I really don't get it but I'm so thankful, grateful and happy that my hair has grown back in at all. I was so afraid I would be someone whose hair never grew back so for all of you worrying avbout your hair, it takes time but the end result will get there sooner or later. I never miss a day without looking in the mirror and being grateful. I wish I could put on a photo but I've never been able to figure it out b ut it doesn't matter.

My brows and lashes are my big issues. At first they grew in but not completely and then I lost most of them and they re-grew but I have thin eyelashes with no volume and I think there are still some clear ones in the mix that stay short so mascara doesn't help. Like you, one set of lashes is better than the other and I sometimes still get them curled inward. That is a pain you know where. My brows are the worst problem. I get the fine hairs above the brows and a little bit under but nothing to fill in the actual brows. I had them threaded sometime back and now nothing grows between my eyes where I always had to remove the hair. This is all so weird for us. I hope someone can help us. I use pencils and powders but I would love to find something to help fill in with real hair.",

I'm at a point I'm afraid to pluck any hair for fear nothing will grow back ever since the middle brow hasn't come back at all. I'm not complaining about that but am afraid of any other part of my brows. Has anyone dyed their brows when they're missing brow hairs? I'm desperate here. lol",

I don't know how it works but having it under my arm and partially on my breast is comforting and takes down swelling. Someone mentioned using a round swell spot and maybe I'll look into that.

I told her about the phone message and she said and said I needed further clarification and I wasn't leaving.

My O said it had been growing about 7 to 8 years but was so deep to the chest wall it couldn't be seen. It became aggressive at some point, and I ended up being told I was stage 2, had chemo with little results, radiation, surgery where I was then told I was really Stage 3 all along but they didn't know that before surgery.
