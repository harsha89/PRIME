Mammogram was negative however my ultrasound found a 1.6 cm solid nodule.  I knew something was up when the ultrasound tech stopped saying, \"nothing to worry about\" and I wasn't even asking her about it.  I was her measuring a black spot and knew something was up.  When I left I asked her if everything was still ok and she said, \"nothing very worrisome\".  I left freaking out.  Just the change her wording made me know that she found something.  I convinced myself that it had to be a cyst.  Two days later I got the call.  I nearly collapsed after being told that it was a solid nodule.  I had a core biopsy a few days later and within a week I learned it was a fibroadenoma (benign tumor...common for women in my age group...I'm 33).  I sought a second opinion with a breast surgeon at a breast cancer clinic.  He had his pathologist look over the slides to make sure everything was ok with the first report and everything was.  They also did some more ultrasounds with their breast specialist radiology department to make sure that the original images were good.  This past January I had my follow-up ultrasound and the tumor looks exactly the way it did in May of 09.  I have another check-up witht he surgeon in August.  I don't have an ultrasound appointment but I may ask for one.  Since the core biopsy I've noticed that after I ovulate the area where the tumor is gets tender.  The closer I am to my period, the more tender it gets.  I never noticed this before the biopsy but the biopsy was also pretty painful for me.  I don't think they numbed me very well and I let them know that I was in pain.  I could feel the needle ripping the tissue out of me.  Horrible, but very very very uncommon.  I think this is why I still get the cyclical pain, which is also common with fibroadenomas.  The breast surgeon says that the discharge is normal and that it's due to fibrocystic breasts.  My OB says it's hormonal.  I did notice that if I try hard enough I can get an even smaller amount to come out of the other breast when I squeeze on the exact same spot.   Let me just note that my discharge was never spontaneous and was only bloody for a few days after my biopsy (I had to check if it was still there after I removed the bandages and got freaked out by the brown color).  It went away and hopefully will never come back.  You may want to get a second opinion from another breast specialist just to be sure that everything is ok.  Blood is usually a sign that something is going on (papilloma - benign - most of the time). ",

I'm so sorry for your loss.  The past few weeks sound like they have been very hard for you.  Here's what I do to keep my fibroadenoma in line: -Monthly breast exams immediately following my period.  My tumor isn't palable but I know where it is so I am extra vigilant about monitoring that area for any changes. -Maintain my breast surgeon's recommended follow-up schedule.  I don't put off appointments with him.  I also make sure that everytime I see my OBGYN that I remind her about the fibroadenoma so she does an especially good clinical breast exam paying special attention to where the tumor is. -Something you may want to inquire about is getting your vitamin D level checked.  Adequate levels of vitamin D have been linked to a smaller risk of getting breast, colon, and other common cancers.  Before taking vitamin D be sure to get the vitamin D blood test as having too much vitamin D in your body isn't good for you.  You have to ask for this test.  It's not part of your standard work-up. -This is just my personal opinion.  Considering that fibroadenomas are driven by hormones and that studies have shown that starting bc pills at an early age is linked to a higher likihood of developing a fibroadenoma (it's also linked to breast cancer) if you are on any type of bc pill or are considering it you may want to read up on birth control and fibroadenomas or discuss it with your breast surgeon.  Your OB may not be so aware of this link as the focus is usually on breast cancer and birth control pills.",

I completely understand your stress.  I have similar stress and my tumor is biopsy proven to be a fibroadenoma.  If you are having a lot of anxiety over the tumor which it sounds like your are having then you need to strongly convince your doctor to biopsy the tumor (even if it hasn't grown).  If the doctor refuses or tells you it's just your anxiety/nerves/stress, etc. leave and find a new breast surgeon.  After the biopsy you should have at least a radiologist but even better a breast surgeon following up at certain intervals.  Initially I was being follwed every 6 months and once it was proven via ultrasound that the tumor remained stable I was switched to yearly follow-ups.  Even though my breast surgeon is against it, I have my OB send me for a yearly ultrasound but no more mammos until I'm 40 due to radiation exposure concerns.  Remember, it's your body and you have every reason to be concerned.  Don't let anyone call you crazy/hypocondriac, etc.  You go with your gut instinct because that little voice in your head that is causing this anxiety will not go away until you have answers.  There is no reason for you to be living with this fear.  Sometimes the anxiety can be more painful than the biopsy (which shouldn't be very painful).  When in doubt...biopsy it (regardless of your age).  PS:  I'm going to assume that the ultrasound tech said the tumor looked dirty because of the gray/whitish specs within the tumor.  Fibroadenomas have a similar shape to some cysts but unlike simple cysts which are solid black on an ultrasound they are speckled with these gray/whitish specs making them look like a complex cyst (meaning a cyst filled with debris or blood).  As long as the tech didn't use the word spiculated try not to read too much into what she said about it looking dirty.  Techs really shouldn't be talking about their findings because they aren't doctors. ",

At your age, chances are very high that it is a fibroadenoma.  However, it's best to be sure that you're dealing with a fibroadenoma instead of its nasty cousin, the phyllodes (can be benign or malignant...it also tends to grow faster and bigger than a fibroadenoma).  If your biopsy comes back as a fibroadenoma, you will most likely be placed on a 6 month check-up schedule for a year to make sure the tumor doesn't change in its appearance, size, or behavior.  If you have a radiologist doing the biopsy then I'd follow-up with a breast surgeon afterwards so the surgeon will keep a good eye on it for you.  Good luck!  I wouldn't lose too much sleep over this right now.  I did even though everyone was telling me I was getting too worked up over it because chances were that it was fibroadenoma. ",

If this doesn't work then try calling a cancer center, preferably one with a breast cancer clinic or center.  Again be sure to point out that this is for diagnostic purposes (even if this is your first one).  Don't assume that the person you are talking to on the phone understands this.  If none of this helps, call your doctor and have her make a request for an earlier appointment.",

Then I saw my breast surgeon.  He re-did the ultrasound because he said the breast cancer clinic's expert radiologists and technicians can get better images because he likes the pathology to match the radiology.  He said that fibroadenomas tend to move away from the biopsy needle which makes it harder for the needle to get into the fibroadenoma.  When he said that I think he was hinting at the biopsy coming back as fibroadenomatous changes and not a fibroadenoma.  He told me based on what the ultrasound showed, he'd either see me again in 6 months or do another biopsy.  The ultrasound confirmed a fibroadenoma appearing tumor.  He also had the clinic's pathologists looks at my biopsy slides.  I never looked at this pathology report.  I know to always ask to see the pathology but I was scared to maybe read something that would send my anxiety through the roof because I usually leave no leaf unturned.  Six months later when I asked him what his pathologists found he read the new pathology report in front of me and looked up at my eyes and said, \"This is defnitely a fibroadenoma.  No cancer.\"  My theory...since a core biopsy is only a sampling of cells, not the whole tumor, it makes it harder for the pathologist to find all of the necessary characteristics to call it a fibroadenoma.  Fibroadenomatous changes has the common features of a fibroadenoma.  I am 100% sure that the radiologist who did the biopsy hit the tumor because I watched the needle go into the tumor on the ultrasound monitor.  I think this is one of the reasons why when atypical hyperplasia is found the lesion is removed from the breast.  Sometimes, without having the whole tumor pathologists have a hard time differentiating a pre-tumor condition (i.e. hyperplasia) from a tumor.     ",

      "Content": "Feb 9, 2010 04:51AM - edited Feb 9, 2010 05:11AM by alligans I've decided to go back to the breast surgeon after reading your stories.  They did scare me but that's a good thing.  I tend to be proactive but I also tend to have healthy and cancer anxiety and overanalyze and worry obsessively about these things.  I am trying to stay calm because things look very good for me right now but I don't want to make a stupid decision that I will regret down the road.   Sooo...I'm back at the worrying stage again.  I see the surgeon on Monday, the 15th to see if he will remove the fibroadenoma so I don't worry about it for 7 years.   About a month after the biopsy I noticed 3 swollen nodes in my cervical neck.  I know they weren't there in April (long story but my neck was checked via ultrasound because I was concerned about something).  They haven't grown and are most likely still swollen because I touch them to make sure they are staying the same or getting smaller.  They have gotten smaller since I found them but are still touchable.  They are around 1 cm...possibly slightly smaller.  This set off fears of lymphoma so one node was FNA biospied with no malignant cells found just a reactive node.  I also had a CT scan of my neck (which showed everything in my head from my eye balls down to part of the supraclavicular ares).  Nothing abnormal but the 3 nodes which the radiologist didn't think much of.  The breast surgeon wasn't aware of this as I saw it as a completely different issue.  He did check my armpit nodes and supraclavicular area but not my cervical neck.  Now I'm starting to wonder if these nodes are connected to my fibroadenoma.  I was wondering if a tumor that looks benign, is core biopsied as benign and has remained unchanged could actually me a type of breast cancer that has spread to my neck nodes.  The tumor looks exactly like it did in May 09 so I'm guessing that it isn't possible.  I'm guessing that a metastic breast tumor would look different after 6 months.  Is this a good guess or a bad one?  Ughhh...I hate anything medical.  My life has been a mess since my doctor found a calcium level of  10.4 in January 09.  After reading about high calcium I flipped out emotionally and anxiety has gotten a strong grip on me.  My PTH was smack tab in the middle or normal and the calcium never to anything above 10.2 again.  At last check it was 9.6 which the hematologist/oncologist told me is a good indication that the high calcium wasn't caused by a malignancy becasue the calcium with continue to be high (it's been checked numerous times at my insistance).  I saw the hematologist after nagging my primary about the swollen nodes, lymphoma, and my fear of the calcium indicating a malginancy.  Every doctor I've seen who has looked at and touched the nodes is well aware of the calcium issue and the fibroadenoma issue.  I feel like such a medical mess that is in limbo all of the time.  Everytime I see a doctor the first thing they diagnose me with is anxiety.  I've been politely kicked out of 3 ENT offices and an endocrinology office (another long story but nothing is wrong with my thyroid which has been checked 3 times).  In the past year I've had a colonoscopy, 2 back MRIs for a backache that eventually went away, a back x-ray before the MRI but I wasn't satisfied, numerous blood tests (numerous CBCs, numerous liver panels, metabolic, PTH, LDH, ESR or Sed rate, urinalysis, 3 pelvic ultrasounds for a small cyst, that went away, prolactin for the discharge, von Willebrands, bleeding time, 3 neck ultrasounds, a neck CT, abdominal and renal ultrasound, lymph node FNA, skin biopsy because the dermatologist was arguing with me that I cluster of spots on me was not petechiae when in fact the biopsy proved him wrong, 3 mammograms...1 for a diagnosis, 1 post clip insertion, and 1 because the breast center couldn't get a hold of my orignal mammogram, 5 breast ultrasounds...1 for diagnosis, 1 during core biopsy, 1 two months after the biopsy because I was still feeling pain from it where no pain existed prior, and 2 from the breast center to diagnose and follow-up).  From all of this, nothing abnormal except for a minimally elevated calcium level which never reared its ugly head again and a fibroadenoma.  I'm scared to death and am sick of being told that I'm anxious.  I know I'm anxious...I live with it daily.  If someone would just get rid of the fibroadenoma so I can be sure that I'm ok and get rid of one of the nodes so I know that I'm ok then I'd be able to get on with my life.  I feel like I've aged 5 years in this past year from all of the worry that the orignal calcium test caused.   Ladies, I'm sorry I went on and on but maybe someone on here can relate and help me sort through this because it's been inside of me for a year and I am not getting much help from the specialists I've seen.  My primary doctor has been great but he is starting to think I'm nuts too and is only sending me off to these specialists with the hopes of reassurance that I'm ok.  He looked into my eyes twice and said, \"I don't think anything is wrong with you\".   I read so many misdiagnosis stories on here and on the lymphoma board and I fear that I am being misdiagnosed about one of these conditions because nobody will cut these things out of me.  I've so had it.  I don't trust most doctors because if they can't find it they assume you're nuts and don't want to listen to my concerns.  My family has had it with me which at this point I understand.  I've had it with me too but I can't get these stories out of my mind.  Most likely I'm not one of these stories but I don't want to regret later what I could have fixed sooner. Any advice or help? Thank you so much.  It feels good to finally get my concerns out in the open.  If anyone can relate me help me sort through this.  You can PM if you want.",

Lymph nodes swell for a large variety of benign reasons but they can also swell from cancer (I'm not saying you have cancer).  You will most likely notice the ones in your neck swell when you have a fever, sore throat, cold, nasal drip, infection in your throat such as strep, scalp infection, a virus, allergies, and even bad bouts with acne.  Most of the time lymph nodes swell for benign reasons.  Anything over 1.5 cm in most areas is concerning if the lymph node remains swollen for longer than a month.  Anything over 2 cm warrants a biopsy if it does get smaller within 2-3 weeks.  A lymph node that is hard and/or immobile (attached to underlying tissue) warrants an immediate biopsy regardless of size or location when there is no visible fever or illness present.  The cancers that would be concerning to a swollen lymph node in your breast would be breast cancer and lymphoma.  However, since the radiologist could see the fatty hilum your lymph node is most likely benign.  The average human has 500-700 lymph nodes running thoughout their body.  Their job is to keep your body safe.  They collect any crap (germs, infections, bacteria, virus, fungus, cancer cells) and swell up because the lymph node rapidly produces lymphocytes (immune system cells called B cells and T cells) to fight off whatever is trapped in the lymph node.  Excessive touching can cause them to swell as well (I learned this the hard way).  The radiologist wants to biopsy your lymph node for 2 reasons:  A - to make sure it's a lymph node and B - to see if it contains cancer cells.  I had a FNA of a neck lymph node about 1 year ago and it was a little bit of an ouch but nothing bad.  If your doctor is concerned about lymphoma, I'd highly suggest an excisional biopsy as lymphoma is a very hard thing to diagnose and there are literally 40 different varients.  However, a visible fatty hilum (if the words of an endocrinologist that I saw who did a neck ultrasound on me himself) is very reassuring that lymphoma isn't the case. One more thing, if by some odd chance it's not a lymph node, the term circumscribe to describe a breast tumor is usually indicative of a benign pathology but biopsy is needed to be 100% sure. Good luck!  Wishing B9 results for you.",

In my case the PASH was listed as focal which means very small amount.  This is a common incidental finding in biopsies and doesn't really mean much of anything.  Just another type of hyperplasia and is benign.  However, there are rare instances when the PASH makes up the whole tumor.  This is very rare although it does happen.  Again, it's benign as long as the pathologist knows his stuff.  Like another poster mentioned, it can be mistaken for angiosarcoma which is a very aggressive but rare type of cancer.  It differs from most breast cancers which are carcinomas.  I think in this instance the most important thing is making sure that it's not an angiosarcoma because pathologically the two can be mistaken for each other.  In layman's terms, pseudo means that it looks like one thing but it actually isn't it.  In this case, it means that it looks like angiosarcoma but it isn't and it isn't malignant.  My layman's wording may make this sound malignant but it's not as long as the pathology is correct.  You may want to get the slides checked over by another pathologist (at a breast cancer center) just to be sure since this is a pretty rare thing (having it as a whole tumor rather than just an incidental finding). ",

During the second 6 month check-up he didn't order another ultrasound and just did a clinical breast exam.  I asked him about another ultrasound and he said it wasn't necessary as the tumor is stable.  I wasn't too happy with that response.  He then graduated me to a 12 month follow-up so I will see him again this summer.  In March I am going for my yearly OB exam so I will ask her to order an ultrasound.  She told me before that she had no problem doing that and agreed that the tumor should be looked at yearly.  In October I will turn 35 so I'm pondering whether or not I should ask for another mammogram.  My first mammogram didn't show the fibroadenoma.  The mammogram came back as completely normal.  It was the ultrasound that found the tumor (which by the way cannot be felt by anyone and I'm small breasted).  I think that due to my age I may just ask for a bilateral ultrasound.  The younger you are, the more dense your breast tissue is which is why mammogram screenings usually begin at 40.  Why get a dose of radiation if it's not going to do anything.  ",

      "Content": "Jun 22, 2010 04:04PM alligans wrote: I'm not a doctor but here's my take (I have a fibroadenoma)... 1. Your lump in the right breast does sound characteristic of a fibroadenoma.  Mine appeared on the ultrasound but not on the mammogram.  I can't feel it.  After the ultrasound picked it up (and the report said that it is a fibroadenoma), the radiology report said to biopsy it to be 100% sure.  You sound very nervous about this lump so you should push for a biopsy just to be sure.  You can have a core biopsy (but even with that,  you'll still be on the 6 month follow up schedule.  I am and every 6 months I go through lots of anxiety).  An excisional biopsy would give you a 100% answer as to what it is.  Core is very accurate, especially when the pathology matches the image and follow up shows a stable lesion.  2.  Are the calcifications located where the breast pain is?  If so, you may want to push for a biopsy of them to just to be sure that nothing is \"cooking\" in there.  Breast pain has many benign causes but it can also signify something more serious which is why, IMO, it should be taken seriously and not be ignored until everything has been ruled out.  If you're still getting your period, this pain could be caused from hormones.  If it doesn't go away after you get your period then take that as a red flag and get it further investigated. I have health anxiety which has been getting better over time.  However, after my biopsy I was very anxious over my fibroadenoma.  I decided that the best thing I could do for myself was to find a breast surgeon at a breast cancer center to watch over the fibroadenoma.  He redid the ultrasound and had his pathology people look over my slides to be sure that everything equated to a fibroadenoma.  I see him every 6 months.  Fibroadenomas are benign.  They do not turn malignant.  Sometimes, malignant cells can hide out in the tissues inside of a fibroadenoma or in the tissue surrounding the fibroadenoma.  There are at least 2 women on here who had this.  However, that's the minority.  Most of the time fibroadenomas cause no harm and have no malignant potential.  However, you need to be sure that it's a fibroadenoma.  This is a very common lesion in younger women, but it may just be something that's been in your breast for years that you just never noticied.  I can't even feel mine.  However, you need some pathology to be sure that it's a fibroadenoma.  Sometimes, fibroadenomas can look like another tumor called phyllodes tumors.  Some phyllodes tumors are benign and some are malignant (strage wording but I've only read a little bit about this tumor so I don't know about this gray area tumor).  With a fibroadenoma-like lesion appearing on a mammogram or ultrasound, the biggest concern is it actually being a phyllodes which is why a biopsy is usually done.  Also, not to scare you but so to educate you in helping you to make a decision, sometimes benign appearing things can actually be malignant and sometimes malignant appearing things can be benign.  I'm not a doctor, but I think that any lump appearing in the breast should be biopsied so that you are sure what you're dealing with.  I'm surprised that the radiologist didn't recommend this.",

Although not 100% accurate, at your age there will be a better chance for the radiologist to find whatever you're feeling.  I have a benign tumor called a fibroadenoma and it wasn't seen on my mammo which came back as normal but it was found via ultrasound and it's 1.6 cm (not that small but not huge either).  Good luck and I hope that everything turns out benign for you (chances are good due to your age but you still need to get this checked out as 22 year olds can get breast cancer...albeit rare).",

      "Content": "Aug 15, 2012 10:47PM - edited Aug 15, 2012 10:50PM by alligans What kind of biopsy did you have?  The pain could be any number of things from injured tissue to an infection or possibly something else .  Do you have a fever?  Is the area where the biopsy done red, inflamed, swollen, or warm to the touch?  If so, it could be an infection. I had a biopsy in 2009.  Before the biopsy my breast never hurt.  My biopsy was in May and I was still hurting in July.  It was especially bad during my period.  One day while at the park I leaned against a playset and I was like, \"Ouch\".  I decided that that may not be normal and called the radiologist who did my core biopsy.  He said that he had never gotten a call like this before.  He wanted to examine me and he wanted me to get an ultrasound just to make sure that it wasn't an infection, hematoma, or something else.  I  had the ultrasound and everything looked ok.  Eventually the pain went away.  Once in a while it will be a little achey but nothing major.  Usually my period has something to do with it.  I have no idea what is causing this but it's definitely from the biopsy as I never noticed this before. The best thing to do is to call the person who performed your biopsy just to be sure that everything is a-ok. Edit:  Just saw that your doctor is on vacation.  Are there any other doctors in the practice that could examine you?  Perhaps your OB could see you?  Just a warning, my OB's office is very lawsuit paranoid for some reason.  They wanted nothing to do with me since they did not do the biopsy.  The stupid office manager was very nasty to me on the phone but I eventually convinced her that I needed to be seen by a doctor.  I ended up getting hold of the radiologist (I didn't think they saw patients) and he examined me.  If none of this is possible, maybe there is a walk in clinic that takes your insurance?",
