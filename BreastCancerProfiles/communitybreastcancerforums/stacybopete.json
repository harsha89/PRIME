It has been almost 6 months and i have noticed that where my lump was originally has become bigger and bumpy feeling. I thought once I had a lumpectomy, that I wouldn't feel a lump there anymore?? I am a little confused. Why does it seem bigger? Is stromal fibrosis and hamartoma the same thing? And why am I having to come back every three months to have bilateral breast ultrasounds??

      "Content": "stacybopete wrote: I'm 26 with an extensive family history of breast cancer. Nov 2009 had a lump come up in my left breast. It doubled in size by dec so I had an ultrasound it looked suspicious and a needle core biopsy that later revealed stromal fibrosis. but due to my family history we decided to take it a step further by me having a lumpectomy. I had it in jan 2010 and it revealed that the pathologist \"thinks\" its most likely a hamartoma. Well im worried. Are they the same thing? Why am having to come back and have ultrasounds done every 3 months? Why does it feel like there is still a lump in my breast after 5 months and why does it feel bigger than it did before??? Sorry with all the questions. i am just really scared that something might have been overlooked. I am having a follow up ultrasound next week and I feel scared all over again.  Log in to post a reply",
