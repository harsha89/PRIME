In my case my urine was cultured repeatedly with no result (urine is supposed to be sterile unless you have a UTI.) Still, I was given repeated antibiotics and finally referred myself to a urologist who scoped my bladder and saw the tell tale signs of IC--raw, inflamed bladder lining and small ulcer type sores.I'm going to collect my thoughts about interstitial cystitis and my five-year battle with it--I will post it on the stage 3 forum here, and will hope it can be useful to everybody with bladder issues.Here's hoping your bladder is okay, and if it isn't I hope you have a UTI!!!

I was glad to read you are going to establish your natural estradiol level. Just be sure it is with the new sensitive assay test and not a run-of-the mill test. The sensitive assay can differentiate between, say, a ten and a less than two. It makes sense to me that this should be routinely done. I wonder how many women have suffered needlessly with AI side effects. Also, I think the dose is too big for some of us, or perhaps as we get older and our estadiol levels naturally decline, we should have a reduced dose. For me, half a pill every other day works to keep my estradiol below 2. I can't take more than that. I tried to get up to half a pill once a day and my se's became horrendous. So many oncs take the position of all or nothing. I have two friends who decided to get off AI's fairly early on. They were not offered the opportunity to take a lesser dose. Both got recurrences Several years ago I found an article in HemOnc Today, \"Estradiol concentrations linked to breast cancer recurrence.\" 3088 women were followed for more than 7 yrs after diagnosis. 153  had recurrence and were matched with 153 participants who did not recur. Women who recurred had an average estradiol of 22.7 pg/ml and women who remained healthy had an average of 10.8pg/ml. I think you can read the whole study in Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2008;doi: 10.1158/1055-9965. EPI-07-0761 Let's start a tradition of reporting our onc's wisdom.

I hope it gives hope back as a small return for all the hope I have received here. First my Thanksgiving: I did not get together with my girlfriends last year but had Thanksgiving with my family. As we all assembled to sit at the table I noticed champagne flutes at every place. My older son did a wonderful toast to me and my survival, noting that that Thanksgiving was my tenth cancerversary. (I didn't know they remembered!) There wasn't a dry eye when he sat down. Then we ate a wonderful Thanksgiving dinner that my children and their significiant others prepared, and I never thought of my reprobate girlfriends and our rowdy celebrations (which no doubt will be relaunched next year.) When I composed my diagnosis line many years ago I wrote \"5 cm\" because that is what the path report said after my mastectomy. However, I had had two lumpectomies without clean margins prior to that and also a surgical biopsy. My oncologist believes it was originally at least 8 cm. My nodes were surrounded by tumors, extranodal extension, matted and clumped. My sentinel node had a 2 cm tumor wrapped around it. My ki-67 was a staggering 70%. I have done well and have been free of legitimate scares. (Have invented a few that have turned out to be nothing thru the years.) I had dose dense AC, then dose dense taxotere, 6.5 weeks of radiation and very sketchy attempts at all 3 aromatase inhibitors. I am just now getting over thinking about my breast cancer (which evaded annual mammograms for at least ten years) and my treatment-- on a daily basis! How neurotic is that. Oh, well, love to all of you. I am so proud of the longevity we are amassing here. weesa (Louisa)",

I say that my tumor was 5 cm but it was hacked up so many times, (4) that my onc says it was at least 5 cm, maybe larger. My five positive nodes were surrounded by large tumors, and worst of all my ki-67 was an astronomical 70%. I only took AI's sporadically, with many unauthorized vacations because they ripped my body apart. Fact is, I have been known to hold Slouchfests at my bar for other survivors who are equally as naughty as me. I am hoping this postcard will give hope to all of you---those who are slouches like me, and those who are conscientious and follow the guidelines for beating this ghastly thing.

Look no further, I have found the solution to the Pink Problem. Not only are my margueritas a proper icon for breast cancer, but they include all the major food groups: most importantly, the lime juice, (the Vitamin C group), the corona beer (the grain group), the tequilla (the vegetable group) and the 7-up (the convenience store group). One glass of it takes care of your oddly yellow-green nutritional needs for the next month!. No bc cells can possibly thrive in this milieu.

If you are er and pr positive what are you going to do--remove ovaries, take tamoxifen etc. I can certainly understand your hesitation about radiation twice. Fortunately for me my radiation was on the right side, but having had a mastectomy prior to radiation, I am sure that side got damaged. In fact, I know it did--my right lung was scorched. I had radiation pneumonitis for a while. I hope somebody will come along in a similar situation as yours. The collective wisdom here is amazing, so stick with us!",

I had purchased a brand new car in 2004 and felt overwhelmed by the manuals and video that came with it. I stashed them in the car, thinking someday I would get them out and look at them. Meanwhile I slowly learned by trial and error the basic rudiments of the car--I could turn on the wipers, lights, turn signals and never tried anything more exotic than the basics. I have a mechanical ability worse than the North American woodchuck, so I didn't try to delve any further into the car, but was always a bit bothered by all the buttons and switches all over the dial that I never ever dared touch. It looked more like a cockpit than a Porsche. So, one extremely hot July day I left the office to get lunch at Burger King and sat in the line for a while with my A/C running. On the way back to my office I became aware that I was burning up, literally, and my ass felt like it was in flames. (The car I had owned previous actually had burst into flames while it was parked, so naturally I became alarmed I had screwed something up again and was on fire.) I saw a guy I knew coming out of my office as I was parking, so I said, \"Hey, Rick, are there any flames coming out the bottom of my car?\" He walked over and stuck his head in my window to talk, and after a few moments, he said calmly, \"Weesa, there are no flames coming out the bottom of your car, but your burger is resting on your seat warmer button.\"  That was how I discovered I had seat warmers, back in the summer of '06.",

I think it was in the mid 80's percentile. Several years ago, fortified with a couple margaritas, I opened up the dreaded bottom drawer of my desk and scooped out hundreds of toxic yellowed pages of old lab tests, oncology notes, ad nauseum, and threw them all out en masse without looking at them. Into a black Hefty bag! To the town dump! It was just something I had to do. Temporarily painful, like cleaning out the back of the fridge, and it felt liberating and cleansing afterwards. So... I can't go back and get the exact number, not that it really matters. I recall my Onc being amazed at my Ki-67 and telling me that meant my cancer was very aggressive. However, my mitotic rate was a 1 (one) which makes me wonder. Shouldn't a high Ki-67 be accompanied by a high mitotic rate? I think my ki-67 was a main reason my Onc told my husband privately that he was hoping I'd get a good three years from the treatment. Didn't know this until recently. Couple of things to think about if yours is high: The ki-67 score is often subject to lab errors. Also, nobody has really gotten a consensus about what in tarnation it means. At least that was the case back when I was diagnosed. I don't truly know why I've made it. My husband thinks it is so I can keep being irritating. At any rate, I wasn't a good cancer patient. I never tried prophylactically to avert a recurrence because I was always convinced it would happen any minute. So I lived life to my own version of the hilt. Jeesh! Isn't this just one friggin scary journey? Love to all my heroes here, Weesa",

In my case, my onc always presents several different options and tells me it's my choice.In the case of AI\"s for more than five years, he encouraged it but I had trouble walking when on them, so he said it was up to me. (Damned if I didn't spent 7 years in college studying English Lit and Psychology instead of microbiology. My bad.)

The reason is intermittent funny rib pains that seem bad for a few weeks, then disappear. My scans are always clean. There is a name for the inflammation of the tissue between the ribs and I think that is really what I have. Can't remember the name of it but it has been written about here.

First of all, I SO know how hard winter is for you.I am originally from Burlington Vermont where the kids at the University of Vermont actually leave with skiis on top of their car in May--to go skiing at Stowe.I've seen snow there on Labor Day in September. Then summer comes, June and July, and it is gone in a flash. My husband who went to college in Ithaca NY remembers the snow, the unrelenting whiteness from October to May first and foremost whenever he recalls college. Something else to mention is that it gets dark where you are by 4 pm and the sun hardly ever pokes thru the gray gloom. You sound like you are feeling a bit of Seasonal Affective Disorder and I don't blame you a bit. I've been poking in my gardens the last few days--the daffodils are up a couple of inches and even the peonies have started little red nubbins under all the mulch. The forsythia is swollen with buds as is the flowering quince. I always think Valentine's day is the first day of Spring here because it is the day my first bulbs bloom. It's nice to have 4 seasons, to have a bit of winter and a bit of snow, but it is nice this time of year to see spring start to unfold. For years, Asheville has always appeared on the best places to live, or retire to.Many of my customers (I'm a realtor) start out thinking Florida is the place for them, and then they have trouble adjusting to the heat and humidity because they didn't grow up with it, and they move to Asheville--we call them half-backs. Well, Mary, I hate to see you like this. You are always our spark plug here, our steady cheerful presence. I know what you need is to sit in the sun all day, even for one day... wish I could send you one.",

For Lauri, a Lady Godiva martini (better than ovaltine.)For Bugs, 200 beers to choose from in a frosty mug. (Sorry we don't have any home made hooch as we'd lose our liquor license.) Rum and Coke for the New Me, and she will tell us all about her new trial. Celtic-Spirit, also known to visit this little pub, will hike here from Calif to have several pints of Guiness. JennyBoog, I'm going to make you a KnockYouNaked Marguerita and some fried okra.ElmCity 69, we will invent a sugar free drink for you, which is going to be tricky, so you can repent from past debauchery. ElmCity  will be our dinner speaker because she is so dang funny. I'll probably skip my usual G and T and have a drink called a \"Screaming Orgasm.\" or maybe a drink called a Klondike Bar, or Sex on the Beach.. Dozens of wine cocktails for Diana and more G and T's for Romansma. We will all dine on greasy pub food that has no nutritional value of any type.EveryMinute will pour us out of there and herd us back on the school bus where she has thoughtfully provided pillows and blankets and bottled water.",

You know, I think I mentioned in an earlier post that I had had weird sensations too in my rib cage and had a bone scan in November. After it was done I was asked to sit in the waiting area for the results! I waited about 10 minutes, and the technician came out to tell me everything was negative, that a radiologist had looked at my bone scan, found a few areas of arthritis in my neck and compared it to an earlier bone scan. Same thing happens when I go to the same hospital for mammograms. I never appreciated this policy until I realized how agonizing your wait was.Pleased for you...",

      "Content": "Feb 3, 2010 04:31PM - edited Feb 3, 2010 04:32PM by weesa More thoughts about interstitial cystitis: There is that same burning sensation when urinating because the urethra is also involved. The cramping feeling occurs because the mucosa is stripped away in the bladder and it spasms when irritated. I too found relief sitting in a hot tub. I had 3 different antibiotics which did no good and when I finally went to a urologist she said the antibiotics actually exascerbated my condition. I eventually took a medication which coats the bladder until it can heal. When you have interstitial cystitis any urine at all in the bladder hurts it since it has no mucous protection, so these pills enable it to have a protective coating. It was a long haul however until I was free of it. I also took an over the counter pill, Prelief, which neutralized acidic food in my stomach before it went into the bladder. The urologist said she sees a good many cases of interstitial cystitis, especially among older women and those women who have had chemotherapy. Does your mother have microscopic blood in her urine--another telltale sign. Please ask the doctor treating her if there is any possibility of interstitial cystitis. I know she is just miserable. BTW, just got back from Caesars Palace. What a place is Vegas.",

The limeade has a good deal of Vitamin C, the beer is full of hops and other healthy grains, and the tequila is derived from the sturdy Cactus plant.( Admittedly the 7-Up doesn't have much going for it except that, you remember when you were sick with the stomach flu or the measles, your mother brought you 7-Up and you felt much better? I rest my case about the 7-Up.)The finished drink itself fills your body's need for that \"Curiously Green Group\" which has its own RDA.  I make this drink in the largest pitcher I own, the same one I use to water my geraniums in the summer, multiply it by seven, and serve it to my girlfriends every November 22 as we toast my continuing success.   Other than imbibing the above health libation, I am not a good example of survivorhood. I do exercise every day and recently have been on a bit of a diet and lost 20 pounds.

      "Content": "Nov 21, 2015 07:55PM - edited Nov 21, 2015 10:16PM by weesa Thirteen years tomorrow. I just read Faithfulheart's comment above about my celebratory cocktails and realized it's time to get out the very large pitcher, (the one that gets pressed into watering the geraniums in the summer),and mix me a big ole batch of margaritas. I make em healthy, with no salt. Plenty of lime juice, beer, 7-up and tequila. Pretty remarkable recipe--covers all the food groups in one healthy libation. I often get personal messages asking for the skinny on my survivorhood, and I do think that cancer cells can't hardly live in my alcohol stream. But here is a couple of more sensible, mature thoughts as well: I had a tough time taking aromatase inhibitors. My joints became so inflamed that both shoulders tore, and one knee. All had to be repaired surgically. What I learned to do, along with my onc, was figure out how little of the AI I could take and still keep my estradiol level in a low, safe range. I tried every other day, and or taking half a pill a day. I found a lab willing to do a sensitive assay on the estradiol level. Much to my surprise, I did not have to take a full dose every day to maintain the safe level of estradiol, and taking a smaller dose helped my inflammation in the joints tremendously .It makes sense to me that we all should not be taking the same dosage. Well... I am sending you all a cyber margarita. Not just for me-- for all of you--we need to congratulate ourselves on how the longevity is piling up here. We Stage 3ers are on the cutting edge of newer, more optimistic statistics. Many women with the scariest statistics are thriving. I myself did not ever expect to be here tonight, despite my cancer-kicking health juices. I had an 8 cm IDC and a layer of lobular underneath it. My sentinel node was 2 cm of tumor and many other nodes were bursting with cancer. Worst of all, my KI-67 was 75%. So, I have just dropped a pebble in your worry pond, let it start ripping outward and give you hope. Love and admiration, Weesa",

First of all, I have to admit I loved losing my hair!  It had always been long and straight and brown. It would never curl even if I put it up in hot rollers or had a perm. I was so limited in what I could do with it, but I had never tried it very short.( I wasn't so happy when I later lost my eyebrows and eyelashes--I thought I looked exactly like a hard boiled egg.) But anyway, I am digressing here. My hair started to grow back in while I was in the middle of dose dense taxotere. When it grew a quarter inch or so I abandoned my various wigs and scarves and hats. (Thank goodness--it was starting to get hot in the Southeast.) Then-- I was amazed to get so many compliments from women who wanted to know where I had had my hair cut so short, that they had always wanted to do it that short. It was no longer just plain boring brown--it came in pretty uniformly salt and pepper gray. And it was coming in in great swirls that turned into curls and waves and lots of body. Pretty soon I had a great big mass of hair I could do anything with-- I could brush it a certain way and it would stay there rather than collapsing into a hunk of flat limp hair as it had for the first 60 years of my life. Then the first weird thing happened--all the gray suddenly disappeared, I am not sure to this day where it went but suddenly my hair was just plain brown again. (I don't think it went down the shower drain because I always checked it, being nervous about AI's.) Still, it was shaggy and curly and so it continued for the next six years. I wore it short and it always looked styled even if I washed it and then hung my head out to dry in the car on the way to work. For the first time in my life I felt slightly chic. Now for the second weird thing about my hair--I stopped taking the AI's in end of April '09 and now my old hair has returned, straight as a stick and limp It looks kinda silly being so short and straight and fine. The curl and great body started to disappear as soon as I stopped taking the AI\"s. Has this happened to anybody else? Seems so peculiar to me. I had taken it for granted, that somehow I had ended up with fantastic hair and that that was my reward for all the unbelieveable crap I had gone thru, never suspecting it was temporary, albeit six years temporary. Guess this has turned into a hair rant, thanks for indulging me.",

I am sure many of them will come on to assure you this is fairly routine--unfortunately. I think your grade 1 and mitotic rate of 1 are very favorable, as is your ERPR positive and Her 2 negative. When I had my surgery ten years ago the standard was many lymph nodes taken out--about 25-- because my sentinel node was positive. I now have mild lymphedema, which, while mild, is quite annoying at times.I have noticed here on the boards lately, many women in this situation are just having one node taken out and letting chemo and radiation do the work on the rest. You might want to inquire about this to your surgeon to see if you are a good candidate for this less invasive node surgery. From what I have read the success rates are the same. Stick with us and remember you have a path report many women here would regard as very treatable, very encouraging.",

Since I bailed out of them at 5 years I don't have much advice except to say I have been fine. One thought though: Do you know if you still need an AI to reduce your estradiol level at the age of 61? There are special labs who will do a serum estradiol with a SENSITIVE ASSAY--important to ask for this and important to find the right lab. Many labs say sure they do estradiol level but they are gross sort of numbers, like to find out if a woman is pregnant or entering menopause. Studies have shown that woman with er positive breast cancer are not as likely to recur if their estradiol level is below 12. So find out if you really still need to keep taking the AI.

I had a number of operations to repair ripped and weakened joints, and while my onc wanted me to continue on for ten years, he supported my decision to stop. I think now more is known about the type of reaction I had but at the time I quit, around 2008 after five years, not much was known about how to counter this reaction. (My onc had not wanted me to try tamoxifen because my port had clotted up once and tamoxifen raises the risk of clots.) There are times I worry about my short spell on AI's which was punctuated with frequent AI vacations. I know my estradiol level is still fairly high. In addition to a sketchy history of AI's I also do pretty much everything else wrong. Bad diet, lack of exercise, use of body products with dangerous ingredients, daily wine. Don't take any supplement except vitamin d3. I think of myself as being uniquely well-suited to give hope to the survivors behind me--pretty much do everything wrong yet don't seem to relapse.

I did absolutely all the things you have reported here. I couldn't hold a thought. One day, still during chemo, I lost my way home over very familiar roads. I knew that they were familiar roads, I just had to pull over and think for a while. The worst examples of chemo brain, however, occurred after I had recovered physically. Here are two examples, both a few months after chemo: I went back to work full time, and as I have always done for years, I put my pocketbook over my shoulder last thing and exited the house. Repeatedly, I would say five or six times, I would be rushing around, and couldn't find my pocket book. I would get frantic and have my husband help me look so I wouldn't be too late. Every time he would look at me after searching for a few minutes, and say, 'Weesa, it is already on your shoulder.\" The worst was one day I had been at a meeting outside the office. Driving back to the office I realized my cell phone was nowhere in the car with me. I was convinced I had it on my lap and when I got out of the car to go to the meeting it had fallen out onto the parking lot. I drove back and searched the parking lot and the floor of the car, no cell phone. I couldn't see it anywhere. Then...I realized I had been talking on it the same time I was searching for it.  Every day for years now I called my voice mail in the morning to leave a fresh message, \"You have reached my desk, today is such and such a date, I am probably out of the office, please leave me a message and I will return your call...\" etc. etc. I could not say this message, I would stumble across the words, finally after multiple tries I would get something that sounded fairly good, but several people who knew me well knew I didn't normally stutter or flub words. That went away gradually. For quite a while Chemo brain was dubious--but now with testing it has been quantifiable. It is not your imagination!. ",

I see my onc for the first time this week since all this started--since he is a hematologist, too. I thought he might help more than my pcp.

Both think I should wait and do nothing for a few months and see if my calcium falls back to normal range. My pcp thinks I was taking too much Vitamin D3--I was taking 2,000iu's a day to get my Vitamin D level from 40 to 55. My onc thinks my pth score does not look like parathyroid disease or metastasis to the bone.He pointed out to me that over the nearly 9 years he has followed me my calcium levels tend to wobble around, once getting as high as 10.6. They would always eventually wobble down to the mid 9's again. He said back six years ago, when I had a 10.6, if that had been bone cancer  I'd would be dead by now! I guess there might be some lessons learned here--first that lots of Vitamin D3 might not be good, at least for me--it is a hormone, don't forget. And always look over your blood tests carefully and get a copy for your files too. When I went back last night and looked at all the old tests, sure enough, I wander all over the place. I just never paid much attention to that calcium score. The other part of my conversation with my dear onc was my dread of my annual mammogram coming up, that I hate being part of that industry. He agreed every few years I should have an MRI due to my very dense breast. In 3 months I will get my blood calcium level checked again, and will let you know. Sorry about the waiting, I know it is disturbing for all of us.I'm determined not to fail you guys, being nine years out, it would be scary to watch me decline, so am not gonna do that!

Backing up, several weeks ago I had shingles on the bottom of my left foot and they seem to be gradually but slowly going away.They were so yuck-o. During this bizarre malady I had to see my doctor several times and the last appointment she did blood work--comprehensive metabolic panel and a CBC, because it was time. I have never had anything on these two tests ever out of range, even when I was first diagnosed, except for a few times during chemo which was a long time ago, so I have never sweated the results. I was unprepared for her call saying my calcium was out of range, that she had been watching it steadily climb for several years and now it is too high. She ordered more tests at the local hospital-- a vitamin D3 (which was 55) and a pcth which is a hormone secreted by the parathyroid glands and often is high if the calcium level is high. It was normal. She was sure I had developed a tumor (always benign) on one of my parathyroids causing it to put too much calcium in my blood, and it, the offending gland, just needed to be popped out.Now she is perplexed. We have four tiny parathyroid glands, two on each side of the thyroid in the neck. Their sole function is to monitor the calcium in the blood. The range for calcium is fairly tight--between 8.6 and 10.2. If you go either way out of range. you get sick fast. (BTW, the calcium in this test has nothing to do with the amount you ingest.) If you develop a growth on even one, they go berserk, taking too much calcium out of your bones, causing thinning bones and other weirder symptoms. Well my pcth test was normal, indicating my parathyroids are behaving normally, so other causes of high calcium are things like bone cancer. I just had, coincidentally, a  bone scan a few months ago and it was normal.My bone density is also fine. I have spent hours with Dr. Google and now have developed 30 or 40 odd symptoms. Been busy all day long making sure I exhibit all these symptoms, like fatigue, inability to concentrate, loss of memory, and loss of balance, and of course I am still hobbling on my blistered left stump, so it's a piece of cake to convince myself I have lost my balance. I need reassurance it isn't time for the glue factory, so please post if you have ever had a calcium level out of range on your CMP. Love to all, and thanks.

      "Content": "weesa wrote: There are three drawers in my house, all in different rooms, that I avoid whenever possible. The first is the mandatory kitchen junk drawer which contains instruction pamphlets for appliances I haven't owned in years, every vet prescription for animals long since buried in the back yard, chop sticks from a Chinese takeout a mile from home, random strings, coupons for food dated April 2003, an impressive number of wine corks, rotten rubber bands that snap when you use em, assorted and sordid barbecue skewers,-- and the rubble is piled so high it catches on the drawer on top of it. The second drawer that is a total disgrace is one of the drawers in my night stand where the leftover expired pain medication from the 17 surgeries I had after diagnosis reside, many vials of dry eye stuff tried out during a taxotear outbreak that are dangerously outdated, some odd brown sticky stuff in one corner of the bottom that I hope is spilled coffee, 4 pairs of reading glasses in stages of disintegration, and, inexplicably, a petrified pizza crust. But the frightening drawer is the bottom one of my computer desk, hard to get to since the shelf with the computer obscures it and it's way down at the bottom, never sees lamplight. Here is where those registers reside that always come with your new checkbook order and are obsolete now thanks to on line banking, and years of photos and newspaper clippings from when my kids scored soccer goals in third grade that I have tossed in there, saving for a photo album for my kids one day at Christmas before they turn 40. Worst of all I have known for some time, underneath everything, my path reports reside.Since I had a surgical biopsy initially, then two lumpectomies without clean margins and then a mastectomy, there are a number (4) of path reports. Some years ago when I created my statistics for the bottom of my posts here, I grabbed the final path report on my mastectomy and recorded the 5 cm etc. mentioned in that report, then stuffed the crumpled paper back under the checkbook bones. Recently I took the whole collection out, thinking I would understand the mystery of those path reports better now, and hoping by reading them in the light of day they would stop that throbbing they do in the corner of my drawer. Welp, I soon realized yesterday I need to add together the various chunks of my tumor from the four times it was excised, and when I did it came out to over 9 cm. Too, I reread the part about the Ki-67, the part that said 75%. I got out one of my pairs of the disintegrating reading glasses to make sure it didn't say 7.5% Nope, it didn't, there was not a trace of a decimal in that sucker. So that is a big mother Ki-67, a bad prognostic feature. Glad I did not appreciate that 11 years ago. When I read here about somebody with a \"worse\" bc than mine (whatever that really means), it gives me hope even when my rational brain knows it is irrelevant since we are all different, and one person surviving a bad aggressive nasty tumor does not mean you will. However, despite this dichotomy of thought, I pass this brave foray on to you, that I have taken on my path reports and will be soon amending my statistics at the bottom of my posts.That I dodged a big one and hope you do too. That I have broken most of the rules for having a favorable outcome. That I still feel well. That I still have days when I wig out about all of this.Love to all, Weesa Sometimes I wonder if I am an old soul temporarily trapped in a breast cancer body.

Every few months my onc allowed me to take a vacation from the AI's. Sometimes I took them every other day or half a pill each day. I kept monitoring my estradiol level with a sensitive assay test, and tried to keep in under ten. If I got it under a ten, I would stop taking the AI until my estradiol level crept up again.

We here in the south don't do skiing, snow shoeing, cross country, ice sculptures or winter carnivals.We golf in the winter. My town just purchased a second snow plow and has run out of salt and sand.The governor has declared Henderson County a state of emergency. No power, trees crashing down. When the first 12 inches came on Dec.18th it was sorta cool and I thought it was a true fluke. We still had that 12 inches of snow on Jan. 1st. Since then we have had a constant line-up of storms with two more already in the hopper. My daffodils are usually up on Valentine's day. Today they are poking thru 4 inches of ice looking like wrinkled shriveled up old ladies. In order to get to my house I have to maneuver the car so it is exactly perpendicular to the tall concrete-like barricade the plow has left at the street end of the driveway. I get as far away as I can, floor the accelerator, ride up the side of the barricade, get airborne and then try to crash land in the tire ruts on my side of the driveway, push the garage door zapper, and skid out of control into the garage and hope I don't crash thru the other side. Fortunately I don't need to do this sideshow act very often because there is nowhere to go that is open. Once in a while tho it feels good to get into a warm car with interior lights since the house is dark and cold. My indoor-outdoor cat needs counseling. He sits and cries at each outside door, I let him out and he won't go. He thinks if he keeps trying, one of the doors will have summer behind it. This Jan.my gas and electric bills were exactly twice what they were in Jan. of 09. February will be great however since the power lines are all down. I had a narrow window of opportunity just now when somebody at Duke Power mistakenly sent us a bit of juice, so I got on line and read where KerryMac is wondering where all her usual snow is. My mother in NH is wondering the same thing and my sister in Boston... Sometimes I wonder if I am an old soul temporarily trapped in a breast cancer body.

What I learned from my frantic late-night googling( before you covinced me to stop), was that many of us get all the vitamin d3 by being in the sun. I live in a very different climate from you and often sit out on my south-facing deck, butt naked, even in the winter months. How much Vitamin D3 one can utilize from the sun depends on your age (the ability to take advantage of the sun declines with age). So it could be on top of the 2,000 units I was getting orally, I was getting a good bit more than you could ever get in the winter from the sun. At any rate it behooves us all to keep track of vitamin d3 levels and calcium, and if the calcium goes too high, have a bone density test right away. Like we need one more thing to keep track of!",

We have defined the problem very well here at the stage 3 forum--nobody should be relying on a mammogram alone, whether you are already diagnosed and wanting to avoid a second local recurrence, or you are a woman about to have her first mammogram. It's awful to feel like the screening test that might save your life is being withheld from you. Not sure where you live, but do you have enough options to keep searching for a doctor whose's a good fit? I've been fortunate, relatively speaking, after my 5cm idc was never detected by a mammogram, my medical team now gives me what I want--US, breast MRI's.We're a bunch of crusaders here, please join us in educating the community in which you live.",

At the same time, I was becoming increasingly uncomfortable with myself when reading about the great feats of many of the wonderful women here: exercise, cycling, being up on supplements, not drinking, being up on the latest preventative research, in general leading a healthy lifestyle.I  finally confessed here that I was a breast cancer slouch. Surprisingly, I had a great deal of wonderful support from women who saw themselves as, well, slouches, too. I proposed that every Saturday in October, in dishonor of Pinktober, I would get together with anyone who could make it to my little Irish pub in the mountains of NC, and provide free drinks and greasy pub food. All they needed to do was not wear pink and check their supplements at the door.Every Saturday in October I met with local women and we had a rousing good time. But, while there was local interest here, nobody threatened to show up from my stage 3 ladies.( I understood--the pub is a long way from anything).My local support group of debauched ladies are all stage 1, so I get lonely for some stage 3'ers. Then came Celtic Spirit!!! She showed up, not wearing pink and lugging no satchels of supplements, and coined the name \"SlouchFest,\" and ate unredeeming pub food and drank adult beverages, Of course, the next day she resumed her healthy lifestyle and went hiking in the DuPont Forest, and took a  wonderful, soothing video of the waterfalls there. So that is the story of the first ever SlouchFest.",

When you have interstitial cystitis the lining of the bladder ulcerates with lots of sores, so keeping your urine ph less acidic helps.My urologist said take as much Prelief as you want, can't hurt. Also, when I get a flare-up I avoid blatantly acidic foods like tomatoes and grapefruit juice and cranberry juice.

Not only that, my family owns and runs a charming Irish Pub which has become the epicenter of life in our town. I love to sit in its front windows overlooking Main Street when it snows with a steaming cup of Irish Coffee. In the summer nothing is better than stopping in for an ice cold gin and tonic with a big slice of lime. And anytime a cool creamy Guinness seems to call me. (After all, \"Guinness is Good for You.\") My husband is a wine connoisseur and family dinners always center around choosing the right bottle to accompany the food. The first several years during treatment and beyond I had no desire to drink. But now I find myself drinking every few days, convincing myself, well, it was so and so's birthday, or somebody bought me a drink I can't insult them, or it's Christmas... etc etc. I know I risk a recurrence. Somehow, I feel I deserve to go back to my former pleasures after so long, a certain complacency is settling in. But when I step back and look, I don't like it, especially since I recently stopped the AI's. Just thought I would throw this out for discussion and maybe there are kindred spirits ( no pun intended) out there. At any rate,it shows that your pressing issues will change as the years go by!

PIP--think you will be okay actually, you will be travelling down the eastern part of the state about 500 miles from me. But it didn't matter if you had a four wheel drive pickup here yesterday, people were stranded on I-26 because of tractor trailers stalled on hills--some were in their cars for 13 hours. Also, there were so many trees down on local roads and live wires you couldn't go from here to there. Flurries here right now. Anyway,you girls are a hoot. Thanks for having fun with me on such a wintry afternoon.Think the grocery store run is a good idea--maybe my butt will steam in public again...from my car seat warmer.",

Not only that, my family owns and runs a charming Irish Pub which has become the epicenter of life in our town. I love to sit in its front windows overlooking Main Street when it snows with a steaming cup of Irish Coffee. In the summer nothing is better than stopping in for an ice cold gin and tonic with a big slice of lime. And anytime a cool creamy Guinness seems to call me. (After all, \"Guinness is Good for You.\") My husband is a wine connoisseur and family dinners always center around choosing the right bottle to accompany the food. The first several years during treatment and beyond I had no desire to drink. But now I find myself drinking every few days, convincing myself, well, it was so and so's birthday, or somebody bought me a drink I can't insult them, or it's Christmas... etc etc. I know I risk a recurrence. Somehow, I feel I deserve to go back to my former pleasures after so long, a certain complacency is settling in. But when I step back and look, I don't like it, especially since I recently stopped the AI's. Just thought I would throw this out for discussion and maybe there are kindred spirits ( no pun intended) out there. At any rate,it shows that your pressing issues will change as the years go by!

You won't feel like this every October when 10-/24 and 10-/25 roll around. You will get more mellow about it, but I bet you will always remember the dates, and why not?

(Long story, much of which I have described in our pinned thread \"5 years.\" ) Four of those surgeries were in two weeks--one surgical biopsy, two lumpectomies, port installation and a mastectomy. My longest surgery was reconstruction. I had a latissimus dorsi and breast reduction on other side and was under for about five hours. I was getting concerned too and feared anaesthesia overload but all my physicians assured me that with the modern methods of surgery this was not anything to be concerned about, and it wasn't. I sprang back really quickly.  The only bad thiing as I got very fond of Versed--propanolol, the stuff that killed Michael Jackson. They give it to you routinely before surgery. It is great stuff when administered in a hospital setting,. I asked for a six pack to take home but they wouldn't give me any.  My advice to you is to relax, enjoy the Versed, and make sure you start taking stool softeners a couple of days before surgery.

Especially if you have repeated bouts of something you think is a bladder infection and your urine does not culture for bacteria. This is a classic symptom of interstitial cystitis. And IC can be controlled and cured but it takes a lot of dedication. You must be careful to avoid acidic foods, and for goodness sake, don't drink cranberry juice thinking it will make you feel better.There are good medications which coat the lining of your bladder so it can heal. And Barb, interstitial cystitis can affect the urethra too. Another price we pay for chemo!  So thanks, Leah, for mentioning IC. There is a great over the counter supplement called Prelief available in most drug stores, that when taken with meals neutralizes your urine so it is gentler on a raw sore bladder. That is how I finally diagnosed myself--after taking repeated antibiotics for so-called bladder infections and not getting better, I tried Prelief  and avoided acidic foods like tomatoes, soft drinks and started seeing improvement after a couple of weeks. Then I went to a urologist. Don't expect to turn your bladder around quickly--they heal slowly, but they do heal. Most chemos are excreted thru urine. I remember getting up during an infusion of Adriamycin to pee and my bladder was already full of the stuff.  Not peeing enough during chemo and not drinking enough water just burns the crap out of the mucosa lining in your bladder, just like it does your mouth and your intestines.",

Breast cancer is really a collection of very different diseases. Some respond to chemo, some don't. Lately, researchers are coming to realize hormone positive breast cancers don't get the benefit that triple negative breast cancers receive from chemo, and pathologically speaking they are very separate diseases. Thank heavans we now have OnctotypeDx to advise us whether chemo could be helpful.While I was undergoing chemo a good friend was battling inflammatory breast cancer. She is also fine!

The areas where tendons met bone were so inflamed, those attachments had turned to mush, making the shoulders weak and prone to tearing easily. My onc and my orthopedic surgeon both believed my shoulder problems were caused by the AI's. A similar thing happened later to my knees but recovered without surgery when I eventually went off the AI's. Another thought: Have you changed out your mattress lately?

I have had no recurrence. My onc never seemed particularly concerned about the fusing of the lymph nodes.I know of many other women here who have had similar lymph node situations. I have read that oncologists are lately taking a less important stance on positive nodes--the number of them etc. Your husband's pathology--especially the Nottingham grade 2-- sounds encouraging. Perhaps somebody will come along more knowledgeable than I.",

I have recently been thinking my hair is finally back the way it used to be--and I finished chemo in MAY 2003! It fell out of course, with dose dense adriamycin--at the time it was brunette with reddish highlights and was straight as a stick as it had been all my life. During dose dense taxotere it started growing back in, and was salt and pepper gray. Then rather suddenly all the white fell out and it was just dark charcoal gray. Then it got very curly and I just wore it short and tousled. Gradually it has been becoming straighter and straighter, and then charcoal grayness left and it went back to my original color. Just this month I have been noticing I no longer have any wave or curl. It looks dumb just short and straight, I am going to have to grow it longer. But what a long time it took to go back to normal. Hopefully the chemo did just as big a job on the miscellaneous cancer cells.I miss my curly hair--it had such body I could do anything with it. I just washed it and fluffed it.Now it is straight and limp again.",
