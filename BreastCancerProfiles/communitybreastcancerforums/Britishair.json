I was diagnosed with Paget's disease of the nipple and underwent a right macectomy with diep reconstruction 2 weeks ago (20th Oct). The blood vessels from the stomach was connected under my arm instead of the front of the breast due to previous scar tissue operations. I had my 2 week check up yesterday the dressings were taken off and replaced with brown tape, today I am feeling more swollen around the breast area and under the armpit is this normal? Is there anything I can do to reduce this or make this feeling more comfortable? I was informed by the surgeon that I made the right choice to remove the breast inside he found early stages of abnormal cells which later in life would have turned aggressive this would not have been noticed if I had the lobocotomy nipple removal....I'm asking for guidance for myself but I also want to send out strength to others who are facing the choice between lobocotomy or macectomy do your research go for macectomy with an automatic reconstruction at the same time don't hesitate. I wish you all the best of luck, God bless youðŸ˜Š Log in to post a reply",
