That was also all clear. They are putting it down to changes in the breast tissue from feeding as I also noticed it in the right breast but it\u2019s not as noticeable because that breast is so much bigger than the other and it\u2019s kinda tucked up underneath. I asked about MRI and they advised it wasn\u2019t necessary and it can often give false positives and cause more unnessesary stress. Can you request a mammogram?",

Breastfeeding at the time and had an ultrasound that came back all clear. Now I have finished breastfeeding and the dent is getting bigger. I went to a different GP today asking for another ultrasound and she literally pushed on the area twice while I was standing and said no. It\u2019s normal and not to worry. I asked to explain why I have the indent and she mumbled something about milk ducts. I\u2019m really nervous because to me the change is drastic it\u2019s gone from a smooth indent to puckered and small lumps. What can I do? I\u2019m very worried for my young baby and I\u2019m feeling really anxious about it. Log in to post a reply",

I often wondered if it was always there but I never really looked at my boobs as much as I did while breastfeeding. Haha. I now take an antidepressant because I\u2019m a super anxious person it\u2019s definitely helped a lot. My friend is a sonographer and radiologist and she has reassured me that Ultrasound is great for detection especially for younger women with dense breasts. Mammogram and MRI are just another modality used for detection. Definitely go back and ask for a mammo. To be honest it\u2019s your body and if your still concerned follow your gut. I was told I don\u2019t need to go back but I will be asking for a follow up scan/mammo in 6 months time. Just to put my mind at ease.",
