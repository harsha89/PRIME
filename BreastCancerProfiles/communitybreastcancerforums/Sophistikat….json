It was also in 39 of her lymph nodes (i think) by the time she found the lump. She underwent chemo and has just finished her radiation too this week and is going on a chemo pill too soon and a pill to bring on menopause. However she has just been told that it has now spread to her ovaries. Does this mean it is metastatic and is Stage IV? She meets with her consultant tomorrow for the full story but I am driving myself mad researching and would love to hear your thoughts.",

We are in Ireland so don't have the choice of those places unfortunately. Going to see her this evening so woll learn more but it doesn't look good at all. It's so aggressive. She only found the lump this time last year.",
