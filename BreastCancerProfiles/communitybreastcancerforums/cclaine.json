I was wearing a tank top and looking in the mirror. I noticed that my  left underarm was considerably swollen compared to my right. I did the whole wait and see for about 3 weeks. I thought for sure if it was a swollen lymph node do to infection it would go away. When it didn't go away I scheduled a doctors appointment with my gynecologist. It took about 2 weeks to get in to her office. I needed a check up anyways. During the examine she felt my breasts and she said that they felt \"Great\" but went on to examine my left armpit and she could definitely feel the swollen lymph node/s. She said since it had already been over a month with no shrinking, that she wanted to send me to a surgeon for a needle biopsy. My appointment with the surgeon was a little different that I had prepared myself for. I went in expecting a needle biopsy and left having scheduled a full removal of the lymph node. My surgeon was very thorough and could feel the lymph node on contact. He explained that he didn't want to miss anything. By extracting the whole lymph node he could find out for sure what was causing the swelling. During my pre op appointment. I signed the surgical form that said lymph node/mass removal. Anways, my surgery is Thursday. Not sure if they are jumping the gun. I have had no image/Ultrasounds done of the area. But feel like they just want to get to the bottom of it. I have breast cancer in my family both maternal and paternal sides. Plus  Several other different types of cancer. It may not even be breast cancer. And Here I go rambling again! I am 27 female  with two darling daughters. I have a lot to fight and live for whatever the results may be.  Thanks for giving me a place to rant!  Log in to post a reply",
