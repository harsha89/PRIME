A 4cm tumor behind my reconstruction implant and 3 pea size lymph nodes in the area between breasts. The tumor grew backwards, through the spaces of my ribs and was touching the pleura of my lung. A biopsy was done and I had the same cancer - ER+, HER2-. I was given Femara and 8 months later everything was completely gone. Was cancer free for 4 years. Joint pain was a big problem. At a Onc visit, I was having a bad day and started crying about the joint pain. So she switched me to Tamoxifen. Within 2 weeks my joint pain was gone! Three months later my PET scan came back - the pleura of the left lung is LOADED with tiny tumors and my entire chest cavity's lymph nodes have cancer....there's alot going on! Onc considers this inoperable since there is so much cancer in the chest. She gave me Aromasin for 3 months and a new PET scan. Absolutely no improvement, markers went up. Switched to Afinitor/Aromasin. Started this combo on 1 Feb. Yikes, this drug is brutal!! I'm super tired, low appetite, and the mouth sores are soooo painful. Haven't eaten a decent meal in over a week and the weight is sliding off me. I'm feeling a little down which is so not me. Fingers crossed that this drug will clear this mess up. Any ideas on what to do about these sores? I was given a mouth wash which numbs my mouth but only lasts for a half hour. The label says to use every 6 hrs. I'm so glad I found this site. Wishing everyone a good day!  ",
