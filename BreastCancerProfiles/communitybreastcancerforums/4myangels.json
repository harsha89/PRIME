      "Content": "Jan 15, 2013 04:17PM - edited Jan 15, 2013 04:20PM by 4myangels Hi Everyone, I'm 43, married with two children aged 6 and 8. My kids are my angels and everything I do, including this fight, is for them. (hence my screen name). I'm a fairly typical suburban housewife, but at one point, before my kids were born, I had a successful career. I gave it up to spend more time with my kids and have had no regrets. I was diagnosed at age 42 with a single met to my spine. It's been hard for me to come to terms with having stage iv, incurable cancer mostly because I was aware of the lump in my breast for several years. I've always taken care of myself by eating really well, working out and going to the doctor every year for physicals and for anything else that came up. I even did regular self breast exams and every time I would say, \"there's that darn cyst again!\" My relatives have all lived until their nineties, so with no family history of any type of cancer and regular reassurances from multiple doctors that my lump was nothing \"because it moves\", I was fairly surprised to learn that it was in fact cancer. I always thought breast cancer was an old lady disease. Ha! Shortly after learning I had cancer, I had a PET/CT and found out I had a met on my spine. I was shocked and heartbroken. I always thought that even if I did have breast cancer, it was the good one to get. My husband is very supportive but I know he prefers to forget I have cancer. I don't complain to him and I try to stay as positive as I can around him because I know it just makes things easier for everyone. I am so grateful for these boards because I feel I have the freedom to express my worries, sadness and anger and all of you have been so welcoming, understanding and forgiving. My job as a mother is to do everything I can to prepare my children for the world. I hope every day that I can see them grow up, but I also understand how uncertain my prognosis is. I've been cramming a lot in, giving them a lifetime of love now and no longer thinking \"I'll do that with them when they get older.\" It's either now or never.",

Second, I was getting a Zoladex shot every 28 days and that sucker hurt going in. Third, it was fairly easy although it was my first surgery of any kind so I don't have anything to compare it to. I was feeling not so great for 2 days and that was it. I can't lift anything more than 10 lbs for 4-6 weeks so I've kept my physical activities to a minimum. As far as the effects of menopause, I haven't noticed much of a difference except for a few more night sweats. I was already getting hot flashes before the surgery. If you're already getting hot flashes, I wouldn't worry about being thrown into menopause. You're already there, hon. The other thing I want to add, is that I noticed the lump in my breast get smaller after the surgery. My onc thinks I'm crazy because I was getting zoladex and that's supposed to be the same thing. However, I did notice a difference. So for me, I feel the complete removal of my estrogen factory was better than shutting them down chemically. I'm not sure if anyone else had this experience. It could very well all be in my head.",

I haven't worked in 8 years but I suppose I could get a job and get health insurance that way, but will there be an issue with having a pre-existing condition (ie, cancer)? Besides who would hire a terminally ill cancer patient anyway? I'm not even sure what to do first...find a lawyer, file? I think I need to buy the divorce for dummies book. And what about the emotional aspects of doing everything alone? My family lives out of state and I don't have many close friends nearby. Actually this part for now won't be so bad. Dh barely went to many of my appointments anyway. It's when I get more sick that I'm worried. I hate cancer. Dx 5/21/2012, IDC, 2cm, Stage IV, Grade 2, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

Her story is incredible and I admire her for telling her story so that she might help someone else with similar circumstances. That said, I'm not really sure what the point of the Komen ad campaign is. Are they trying to bolster their image that was so badly tarnished after the Planned Parenthood fiasco this past February? Or, are they trying to educate people about advanced breast cancer? I don't think the ad will achieve either goal. The unfortunate takeaway from this ad is that HOPE equals CURE. In the last 30 years Komen has done so little to get us closer to a cure but now they're trying to take credit for the woman's long run with mets because they gave her HOPE. Give me a break. If you read her blog, you'll see she's running rather low on hope these days. It's such a shame that Komen can't claim that what has gotten her so far is treatments developed with Komen research dollars. Komen can't claim that, because it gives so little to research. I'm glad I'll be able to count on Komen for hope, but I'll be counting on other organizations for research and better treatments.",

Her daughter was young at the time she died, but she filled the tapes with all sorts of motherly advice her daughter would need later in life (how to wear make-up, how to deal with boys, what if her father gets remarried perhaps, etc.) since she wouldn't be there herself to help her daughter. She also bought a bunch of charms for her daughter to make a charm bracelet and her daughter opened one on each of her birthdays. I never really watched Oprah, but I did happen to see this one episode. I cried and cried when I saw it, not realizing I would be in that position myself many years later. (my kids are now 6 and 7) So, my question is, what should I do for my kids? I'm not really a video person. I could write letters, put together photo albums, etc., but would they want this? It would take a lot of time, and I'll do it if it provides them comfort, but maybe they'll just want to get on with their lives. I just don't know. I kind of hoping to hear from people who lost a parent when they were young or knows someone who did. Did they leave anything for you? Did it help you?

I didn't have any symptoms but my surgeon was just being cautious. It showed a small spot on my spine so I had an MRI of lumbar region. Then, I had a bone biopsy to confirm what they suspected. Surgery was cancelled and I started treatment soon after. Since my primary tumor is still there, my doctor can determine if the treatment is working. So far, it's shrinking, so that's a good sign. Follow-up scans will be used as well to check for progression. There are many others who have doing this a lot longer than me so hopefully they will have some useful insights as well.",

What Komen does care about is money. It's only when the money stops rolling in and they can't throw as many pink parties that maybe they will listen and change their direction. The real money is not from the walks, but from the corporate sponsors that make $1 million plus donations. Here are a few listed in their annual report: American Airlines, Bank of America, Belk, Caterpillar, Conde Nast, Ford, Frito Lay, General Mills, KFC, New Balance, Yoplait. If we really want to make a difference, we should be sending some of those beautiful, heart-felt letters I've seen on this board to the heads of corporate giving at these organizations.

Those are two different things. If more women are being diagnosed at a younger age, than that would imply there's really something going on in our environment that's causing this to happen. If it's that more young women are being diagnosed with advanced cancer then it could be that more of us are getting PET scans at diagnosis? That's what happened to me. I would have gone about my business thinking I was early stage had my breast surgeon not ordered one right before surgery. My concern is that the whole pink movement has downplayed the seriousness of breast cancer. This is just a theory but I wonder...many people think breast cancer is curable thanks to the 98% statistic Komen likes to brag about. Are young women not seeking medical attention early enough if they notice a lump? Is that maybe why when it is diagnosed it's more advanced? Just wondering.",

I think I'd be feeling too vulnerable wearing nothing but a paper gown in a tiny exam room telling someone they ruined my life. I'll be due for another annual gyn visit soon and I can assure you I will be going somewhere else. In fact, I just got a postcard from my gyn as a reminder and I called her office telling them never to contact me again. As you may remember, I too was grossly misdiagnosed for years by three different doctors. In my case I had a lump which was ignored by a doctor all throughout my 30's. I starting screening at 40 but it came back negative. Same thing at age 41. I stupidly believed those doctors who told me it was nothing. I was on hormonal birth control the entire time too! At 42, my lump was finally big enough to show up on the mammo. That's when my world fell apart. I too am angry and pissed. Since I was diagnosed, I ordered all my medical records to figure out what the hell happened. I was horrified when I saw that the doctors simply scribbled down that I had \"fibrocystic breasts\" even though I had specific conversations with them about my lump. There was no mention about the lump in any of my radiology reports either, and since nothing was written down in my medical records, there was no way to cross-check. I truly believe that any of the 3 doctors who misdiagnosed me could have saved me. However, I've only dealt with the 3rd one so far. For doctor #3, I had my primary care physician call up her office and let her know I was stage IV. My PCP had just lost her own sister to breast cancer so she was the right one to chew out my GYN. My GYN now thinks I'm suing her (I'm not, but I'm going to let her worry about it until the statute of limitations runs out.) I'm still trying to figure out what to tell doctors #1 and #2. I will probably write them letters, but I'm just not ready yet. What angers me so much about my situation is the fact that I had an obvious lump yet my screening tests came back negative. Doctors don't understand how unreliable mammograms can be and that's just wrong. If doctors don't understand how unreliable they are, how are we, as patients, supposed to understand? Even when I was finally told \"it's probably cancer\" based on a breast MRI, I asked my doctor if it was early stage. She said, \"as long as you got your mammogram last year.\" What an idiot. If I didn't have small children, I would be writing blogs, articles, books and whatever else to tell the world how useless screening is for some women and how stupid some doctors are. But, my disease will already take so much away from my precious kids, I don't want them growing up thinking something could have been done to save me. I do know that since my primary care physician called doctor #3, they have changed the way they do things in their office. I don't have specifics, but I do know they are more careful now. I suppose I'm pleased with that. So maybe whatever you decide to do, try to approach it that way. As awful as our situations are, maybe somehow we can save someone else from going through this. I hope this helps and I'm sorry if this turned into a rant just about me.",

Also, in case you're looking for ideas for another one of these fantastic videos in anticipation of October, it would be great to do one profiling women living with metastatic cancer who did everything they are told to do during the month of October (go to doctor, self breast exams, get mammograms) but still wound up with metastatic breast cancer. The picture of Suzanne Hebert made me think of this. We have a long way to go in terms of detection and treatment, and a lot more funding needs to go to metastatic breast cancer. I really feel that more and more people think breast cancer is largely survivable when in reality it's quite different.",

Just watching a professional football game these days makes my stomach churn. Seriously, how are pink cleats made in China going to save my life? However, I'm glad that so much attention is being given to breast cancer. In 2011, Komen raised $475 million, the BCRF around $40 million and Avon raised around $50 million. That's over a half billion dollars in one year going to just these three charities. There are over 1000 breast cancer charities out there, so the total amount raised in the name of breast cancer is even higher. Pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, etc. are deadly cancers too, but don't get anywhere near this amount. The fundamental problem with pinktober is very little money is going to research and people don't know this. Komen is especially guilty of this given how big a piece of the fundraising pie they own. They give somewhere around 15% to research, including less than 2% to resesarch for metastatic breast cancer. This needs to change. Then there are all the companies that ride the pink wave by selling products with pink ribbons. They are using the disease to make money. This is wrong on so many levels. New laws have just been instituted requiring companies that engage in cause marketing to disclose exactly how much goes to breast cancer charities. This is a step in the right direction, but more needs to be done. So, given how much money the pink stuff has raised, in some ways, I'm actually OK with the pink. My sister made pink ribbon magnets for me and everyone in my family. The ribbons won't help find a cure for me, but it's her way of showing she cares and everytime I see it I will be reminded of that. Anyone who sends me a pink ecard, donates to breast cancer charities or walks on my behalf is doing the same thing: showing they care. These gestures don't bother me. In fact, I'm honored and touched by them. What bothers me is the fact that so much time and money is spent on pink stuff yet so little is going to actually finding a cure. There are so many well-meaning people out there who only want to help us live longer but who have been totally deceived by charities like Komen and the companies selling pink crap. I really wish more of this well-intended money would go to research.",

Well, a mammogram didn't find my cancer until I was stage 4. The one I had a year before I was diagnosed and the one the year before that were both negative. I also had screening ultrasounds and they were negative too. So, in my case, yes, mammograms were useless, but not for the reasons stated in the article.

You have given a paltry 3% of revenues to \"The Cure.\" Do you think people will be impressed this? Maybe, but you can't fool me. I am stage IV because mammography didn't work for me. Andrea, awareness is not a cure. Hope is not a cure. Only research will save me and the 40,000 women who die of breast cancer every year in this country. Instead of spending money on lavish pink parties and CEO salaries, how about trying to actually accomplish the goal Nancy Brinker set out to achieve more than 30 years ago? How's that for an idea?",

Tumor markers, scans, symptoms? I get scanned every 6 months and so far each month my tumor markers have been normal. So I will basically be living in 6 month increments and I'm worried about how much this thing can spread in that amount of time if a treatment fails or worse, never works at all once I switch.",

Apparently Komen LA is promoting free mammograms with an ad that basically states that mammograms are the key to surviving breast cancer. I did get mammograms AND ultrasounds every year and here I am at stage IV because nothing ever showed up on my imaging. This is just great. Blame the victim and let's keep convincing everyone that every time a woman dies from breast cancer it's because she didn't get a mammogram. Lies, lies, lies!

Good for her.  Many years ago, I was getting concerned about a lump. it was around the time Sheryl Crow and Cynthia Nixon were diagnosed with breast cancer. They both said how important mammograms are for early detection. Since my mammograms and ultrasounds showed nothing and the doctors kept telling me to go home and have a nice day, I assumed I was fine. After all, mammograms diagnose breast cancer, right? It took many years to get a proper diagnosis and now I'm stage IV. These celebrities do all women everywhere a disservice. ",
