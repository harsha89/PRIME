      "Content": "bhelson wrote: Had a lump develop that was very noticeable at 12 oclock in left breast, sometime around christmas, I am only just 30 years old this past week. I thought it was a menstrual cycle thing and watched it for a few months. Its has only gotten bigger, the area I can feel is about the size of a silver dollar. Finally went for a breast ultrasound 3 weeks ago, they can feel the lump but on the ultrasound it was just presenting as extremely dense breast tissue. They wanted to follow up with a mammogram because the lump is starting to be very very sore and like I said it has gotten bigger. Had the mammogram last week and to my surprise the images were astounding, a HUGE white spicualted mass was in my left breast, the right breast is completely normal. I had seven \"punches\" taken today during a core needle ultrasound guided biopsy. The radiologist said the mass was accounting about 40-50% of my breast tissue. At first I thought it was good that nothing showed on the ultrasound, now Im not so sure. Biopsy result should be in by Wednesday. Anyone have a story similar to this?? I have included a picture of my mammogram image. Log in to post a reply",
