Mammo showed microcalcs, stereotactic biopsy showed ADH. Excision biopsy scheduled then postponed due to results of pre surgery MRI. Birads 4 at original 12:00 spot and now a new spot of curve type 2 enhancement at 3:00 suspicious for malignancy. And left Breast is Birads 3 which also worries me. So scared. Learned of ADH two days after my father passed away of cancer. So biopsy tomorrow will determine if I will still have excision biopsy or something more extensive. I have been having shooting pain in both breast for the past three days off and on.",
