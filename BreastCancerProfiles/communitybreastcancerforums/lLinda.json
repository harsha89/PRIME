One day I told my son I felt warm, he ask, Mom are you running a temp, I ask why do I have to be running a temp---he said, \"You don't know you have cancer\", so do you know about a temp? It was a great laugh for both of us, he says \"no one would ever know that you are sick\"--I am grateful for this.  OK ladies--hang in here for all you are worth--I block out statistics---they are worrisome numbers for me---this is my safety valve--Just Live!   My surgeon said, Linda, we will live til we die!!

I am a 10 yr survivor---with the support of, my husband of 43 years.  He tells me I am his \"sunshine everyday\".  I feel Loved!!! He has been at all surgeries, every chemo, and radiation when he could, do to work schedules. We are retired now, just trying to still enjoy life and be happy. He helps with every thing  to keep house, laundry--we are a team and I never forget to tell him how I appreciate him.  He has made me feel like a like a lady, when I felt like \"Not\".  We talked alot about the Cancer in the earlier times---he knows --\"the cancer will have to catch me running'--so I act like so!!!  So it is how we roll--everyday I wake is special to me to be here and he knows that--I have listened to his fears---most peope hear Cancer and think Death--people have to feel what they feel---he says ,he goes by what and how I am, and I have been blessed to be stong by this, and I feel so has he.  I have my \"cancer days\", I may cry or just be sad, but I let him know this is what it is(because you can't run past these feelings either) It is a heavy situation, but you can get through it--together--just be sure to share what you are feeling and let her tell you what she is feeling--it has to come out or it comes out in other ways--Anger, headaches, ect. Take Care and hang in there!!!  Linda C.",

This is a short version of my journey with only a few details.  I hope it will also give someone hope. I started out with a lumpectomy in Nov. 1998.  In 2002 I had to have a Mastectomy, one within 3 weeks of the other one . The situation just seem to snowball from there--to my chest walls, under my right arm and last episode 2009 in my lymph nodes under my jaws--the Herceptin and Navelbine seem to check that, so we are doing maintenance with Herceptin for now.  I have had six occurrences of BC in these years.  I have been on 8 different kinds of chemo.  In the past 9 years, for the exception of 9 months 2008, when my Dr. and I decided to do nothing and take a break, I had been on one Chemo or the other, every week, and when I went to chemo pills, every day.  I have been very Blessed not too have \"bad side effects\"(have had to get off a couple(Xeloda and Tykerb) as they were not right for me) and to be able to still be going.  My history of this, feels long--my journey with many twists and turns.  It will have to catch me running as I will not lay down to it!!  Right now I am on Herceptin every 3 weeks, have been off of Navelbine for 8 weeks to help give the nueropthy  a rest. Breast Cancer can be a \"chronic disease\" and sometimes we have to stay on the meds to live, and for me, when I have looked at it this way, it helps.  I am thankful for all the new meds that are out there, and on the way.  No I do not like having to live this way--I won't complain--as\" I am here\" to support any one on this journey, and say, \"don't give up\"--you may have ca, it does not have you!! Everyone, hang in there!!  I use not to want to tell the new people that I have had this kind of journey, as I thought \"how scary\", that must be to hear--yeah it is--but just know you can make it, as there are people who have----- and will. Thanks for letting me share. Linda C.",
