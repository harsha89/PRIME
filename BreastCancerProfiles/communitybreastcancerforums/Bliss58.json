The fatigue didn't hit me though until a couple hours after tx and then I just felt like I needed to shut my eyes for a little while. Every other day they use the sticky bolus on me, and the techs apologize, but I kind of like it. haha I think it's sort of soothing and comforting. I think that's only used on those of us who've had mastectomies. I see the RO every Tuesday and it's a quick check, I'm assuming, because I'm not having problems, but he does look me over pretty well.

I chose mastectomy and no recon, but still needed rads because of lymph node involvement. I am left-sided, too, but lie on my back for tx and don't do any breathing techniques, but maybe that's because of MX? The first two zaps are from below and the RO said that is to avoid my heart. I'm also doing post-MX exercises to stay loose and maintain good range of motion. BTW, my cloth gown does look like boxers now that I think about it! Haha. My skin is now beet red in the axilla, but just pink in the clavacle area. Wednesday, the RO said I should start peeling within two days, but so far so good, and no peeling. Skin to skin contact causes some discomfort, but the nurse suggested applying corn starch after the cream and it is fabulously soothing. I only have three treatments left; 22 of 25 done!

I started Anastrozole on March 5 and didn't notice any SEs until last week when I started to feel achy joints. It gets better once I get moving and nothing I can't handle so far, but makes me feel years older than I am! This does suck and so engulfs your life, but I remember someone who was years out from tx and commented on the July '15 chemo thread about how it all gets better slowly, but surely. She said she felt at the start like she had this \"Chemo Radio\" constantly playing in her head, but as time went on she listened less and less until she could no longer hear it.

It's very important to find a good fitter. My BS advised a BMX if I planned to do reconstruction. I was pretty certain the PS would advise that as well, but I didn't want additional surgery, recovery, and months more in the process plus potential problems, so I never did consult with the PS. I just wanted surgery over and done. Maybe it was because I was 56 at dx and I would have felt differently if I had been 40, but now I'm over two years from dx and still happy with my decision. The BS prescribed a mammo every 6 mos. for the first year, but after two all clears, I'm now on a yearly schedule. At the time of dx a growth in my kept breast was biopsied, but found to be benign. So far, I haven't considered mammos a drawback. The BS said I may experience back problems, and of course it's only been two years, but so far I haven't had any trouble. I wear the prosthetic, which is weighted, most of the time, so I really don't anticipate an issue. IMO, it all depends on your unique situation and your gut feeling about what's right for you.",

I went to the dermatologist two days before surgery and she burnt off 4 pre-cancerous lesions on my face, one on my leg and one on the back of right hand.

My surgery and a week of recovery were in Denver, but now I'm back at 10,000 feet, and I haven't had any lymphedema problems, so hopefully you won't. either What a disappointment about your oncotype not being back yet, but man, time is flying; can't believe you're already 6 weeks out! Logang, great for you to get out for a weekend trip to TN; enjoy! I too had neoadjuvant chemo and was very pleased to find that I weathered it well and was no where near as bad as I anticipated. I do think a positive attitude is key plus hydration, hydration, hydration, which seems to be key for all treatments. You can do this! So sorry to hear of setbacks for some of you, DF & Stellamarris, you both have gone through so much lately, but you are so strong! Sending everyone here positive energy and love. I am so thankful for and comforted by all the wonderful information, encouragement and support that I find here and throughout the BCO threads. Best wishes to all for a great weekend!",

I ditched my wig at about 4 months because it just got too dang hot once my hair really started growing, and just wore hats and scarves. I had it professionally trimmed and colored at 6 months and then ditched any coverings full time afterwards. Funny, PJay, my stylist said she'd trim it like a pixie to avoid the mullet, too! I went to an Aveda spa that specializes in cancer patients, because the owner herself had cancer, and they use color that is 98% pure; no foul smell at all. It was very pricey, but I think after all I've been through this last year, I'm worth the price and the pampering! I was very pleased with the results and it really made me feel whole again. I had my last Herceptin tx on July 1 and I wondered if it may have slowed my hair growth because now my hair seems to be growing faster; my bangs especially. Yeah!

I live in the mountains of Colorado and will have to drive 1.5 hrs. each way to Denver for rads, but I may stay there with my mother sometimes if the winter roads are bad for driving. I'm enjoying finally feeling like a normal person again after finishing chemo, so I'm hoping rads fatigue won't hit me too hard. We'll see, but I think I'm more worried about that than skin irritation. Planning meeting with RO on Monday. Lots of good info here already, and thanks everyone for sharing.

My favorite place to visit. So glad you'll be going and I think you'll love it. My father was also in WWII, not at Pearl Harbor, but in the Pacific theater. He and my mom went there for their 25th wedding anniversary and he so wanted to visit the Arizona memorial, but it was too windy the day they planned to go and the boats weren't running, so he never got to see it; never made it back. He died in 1996 at 72. My dad never talked about his war experience until much later in life, and then very limited. He and I would sit at the kitchen table and talk over coffee, but I wish I had prodded him more. My whole family went back to Honolulu in 2004, so my mom was finally able to visit the memorial which was very moving. By that time, the Missouri was also there, and mom was determined to visit it because as a teen (she was eight years younger than dad) she remembered seeing it on newsreels and the official Japanese surrender held on it. It was pretty powerful, too, thinking of all the history. Enjoy your time there. Micmel, your daughter is just so gorgeous, and I am so happy for her and you!

I'm starting rads in late December, but don't have actual dates yet. I meet again with the RO 12/7, but I'm pretty sure I'll have 15 treatments. I'm a bit different in that I'll first be radiated for my hip and spine mets, to make certain they've been rendered necrotic. Then it's on to surgery in late January with more radiation to the breast area most likely 25-30 treatments probably in late Feb. or early March. Hello to all my fellow RADS sisters and I look forward to us all sharing our experiences. -Barbara",

Vevs, thanks for your input on half-life, but so sorry to hear about your gastro problems with Xgeva. I go for my next shot next Monday, July 31. Brenda, I got my copy of Bestbird's manual a couple of years ago, but I was on Zometa then, so I'll have to go back and re-read about Xgeva - which I've been meaning to do. I'll have to inquire with my MO when I next see her, too. The PA seemed to think the plan was monthly for at least a year, but then that was the plan for Zometa and MO switched me to every 3 mos. after monthly for 6 mos., so we'll see. Yeah, all I could think is the PA was concerned about blood thinning, but I'm not on blood thinners, so didn't make sense to me. She said, \"well, it's like why they tell you to not take aspirin before surgery.\" Well, I know why they say that before surgery - blood thinning - and they don't want a patient to bleed to death. I didn't pursue it, but I should have asked her if Xgeva thins the blood and aspirin would increase it? I didn't because I didn't think she'd really know the answer. Anyway, I guess anything else is okay to take since the Chemo.care literature specifically mentioned aspirin only. I want to take aspirin though because I have several bottles that I got free in Safeway's Monopoly game, and I'm cheap! haha ",
