For those of you who mentioned that you are taking it now- how did you convince your doctors to prescribe it without being diabetic? Should we schedule an appointment with her general doctor or her oncologist to discuss? My mom's onc has never suggested any preventative measures other than the standard protocol. I've had to do hours and hours of research and bring all of my findings of any preventativedrugs and clinical trial openings to his attention and ask for permission and even then it feels like he is extremely reluctant to agree with me and prescribe medications that have shown to improve survival. Thankfully he was willing to allow her to receive zometa every 6 months after asking multiple times. I was hoping for monthly or quarterly zometa infusions but I guess I'll take what I can get. My mom is also currently participating in the Neuvax trial so entering into a study featuring metformin is not an option unfortunately.",

She never missed a year. She had a clear mammogram at the women's center in my city and a professional breast examination done at another time by our primary care doctor just months before she found her stage 3 cancer herself. Even after it was confirmed that she had cancer, they could not locate the cancer via mammogram. It only showed up on an MRI (her pathology report noted at LEAST 10 different foci.. None of which ever showed on the mammogram) It's been over a year since her diagnosis and I listen to and question all of her doctors often. You wouldn't believe the mistakes I have noticed that they have made- one including administering her chemo at double the rate that it was supposed to be given at. Shortly after I noticed and alerted the nurse she started having horrible back spasms due to the lack of attention to detail that unfortunately happens sometimes. Women think that they are \"safe\" after clear mammograms but the truth is that mammograms do not detect everything. If society would stop giving women a false impression that the mammogram is the holy grail detection tool, a lot of women would find their cancers a lot sooner. My point is, you can never be too safe and should never trust a doctor just because they are a doctor. If you have a gut feeling, always seek a second opinion. But it's really great that you seem to have a really educated and caring doctor who is being proactive about the situation! I think you can feel reassured that if there is a problem, your doctor is being proactive about finding it. But like others have said- most of the time it will turn out just fine and I hope that is the case for you as well :) the painful lump you are referring to deep down very well might just be a rib you are feeling as well. I know my moms surgeon said that sometimes it is hard to tell the difference between a rib and a lump that is deep down.",
