I have had discharge and thought the lump may have gotten big enough to cause that or that it may just be hormonal. I have never had children. I have hypothyroid too. So the discharge may be from that. I just worry because when I got there they didn't have the info from my doctor and they weren't aware there were 2 spots to look at until I told them. I didn't feel very confident in what they were doing but maybe my doctor will be better at what they were seeing. Again, thanks a lot.",

I'll give a bit of history. I'm 32 and a few years ago I woke up with a large lymph node under my right arm. It was very visible, I don't recall it being red or anything, but it went away in about 2 months or so. During that time I found a small lump on the same side the lymph node was on. The lump was maybe half the size of a pea. Now about 2 or 3 years later here I am. The lump is about the size of a carbonzo bean? I went and had a mammogram and so I was scheduled to see a surgeon so he could check things out, but that isn't until June. The womens health clinic called me today saying they want me to have an ultrasound and that the doctor wasn't concerned because it looked like I had cysts. (I found out today there were a few spots) I didn't think to ask if they were doing a biopsy with the ultrasound. So my question is, are ultrasounds usually done without a biopsy and then if they see something they don't like do they do another one with a biopsy or do they do that all in one shot? Thanks for any help!  A great way to keep your mind off of results is to read Charlain Harris vampire series, the first one is \"Dead Until Dark\" Log in to post a reply",

I guess I thought it would be better to do the first ultrasound with the biopsy instead of having to have 2 ultrasounds. Thanks again and for letting me know there isn't much pain if any involved. I had to look up what idc and dcis were but thats good, now I know some more terms just in case.",

They said its probably part of the breast tissue. I'm a bit confused. Does that mean that I'm lumpy? Cuz it really feels different than any other lump. Its much harder and it doesn't move. Thanks for any help. ",
