I have Paget's (feel like the only person on this board that does!).   From my research, Paget's in both breasts is rare. Also, Paget's alone is slow growing. However, Paget's is associated with underlying breast cancer (DCIS often). So you may wish to  discuss with your doctor whether he will do an biopsy or further breast imaging like an MRI. Good luck and keep us posted.",
