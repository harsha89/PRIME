The mole was there before radiation, so no one can/will tell me if the radiation caused the Melanoma. It was caught early at stage 1 and surgically removed that left a 6 inch incision on a breast that has been assaulted enough! Luckily, no further treatments needed. I remember pointing it out to my RO before radiation treatments. He didn't seem to concerned with it. You should see your dermatologist for a skin check.",

I have good days and some I feel like my face is dragging on the ground. My skin is an odd red/purple color. My scar from the SNB is sensitive and so is my nipple. I've been using Aquafor on my nipple and Aveeno lotion on my boob. I do work until 1:30 with the treatment facility about a 10 minutes away from work. Then I head home for the day. Usually, I can take a 30 minute power nap and be good to go for the rest of the day. I hope everyone's RADS fly by quickly! ",

It was bitter sweet, as I will miss the ladies I saw daily who made my treatment time so easy. My skin got very red and sensitive but no sores or anything. My nipple has peeled a few times and gives me the most trouble as far as discomfort goes. I had a lot of fatigue the last half and napped ever day after my treatments. I am hoping to resume running in a few weeks. I hopped on the Tamoxifen train 2 days ago. Hopefully, I will be able to tolerate it! Best of luck to all who are still getting their zaps and those about to begin!",

I'm 15 of 33 treatments in and when the machine is moving around me, I know when they've gone to far or not enough and I talk to the machine in my head. \"Whoops, to far. Nope, not far enough. A little more. Now you got it!\". Of course, I may just be losing my mind. I constantly tell myself that RADS is my insurance policy. I show up day after day for my husband and children. I do it for them. The machine was down today due to storms and a power outage over the weekend. So I got a long weekend break. It felt odd being at work all day.",

Day 1 of 33 is done! I work until 1:30 and have my RADS at 2:00 and then go home. I was in and out the door in 25 minutes. Not too bad! . I have a ton of time built up for sick/vacation, so I will work half days until my treatments are over. I could probably go back to work for a few hours, but I am treating myself to some down time after the last 5 months of dealing with all of this. My boss said go for it!",
