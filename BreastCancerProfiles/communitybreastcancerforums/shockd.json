Post F'n Chemo?  Anyhow, I just had AC #3, so only one more to go, and then those bloody Taxols, and then my hair should start coming back? Ugh.  Only 3.5 months to go, I guess.  Please tell me yes yes yes it'll grow back soon!!! And by the way, all you ladies look LOVELY with your new hair. I am SO jealous.  Hugs.",

RoBo47- so sorry about your hair.  Hugs. ",

I shaved my head and there is a little itty bitty growth, but thinking that soon that will stop soon or fall out.  So glad (as I said before) to see all you beautiful women with your hair growing back.  Can't wait.",
