Now we have left Bermuda and are sailing home and we hit the night club again, when the club band takes a break the lead singer makes her way to our table and says \"Hi how are you doing?\"  Great I say and then she says \"How are you Mrs. Silentbell?\" to which my wife says \"okay how are you?\".......After she leaves it's \"How does she know my name?\"  So I say \"I'd blame it on the brain mets.\"  After an hour she hits the restroom, when she comes back she says \"While I'm at the sink, the lady next to me says \"Your the lady from the first night, you were adorable.\"  We laugh and she goes   \"What the hell happened that first night?\"  I say \"You owned this place.\"  I used the word adorable as an adjective 3 times and then from the looks I got, I remembered I'm not good at sleeping with one eye open.

The scanoligist (yeah, I made that word up) tells us that a week late scan is a major trial violation.  I look at my wife and smile, we don't tell her about putting off an infusion for a week for a cruise.  Habitual violators, that's us.  So now we have had way too many mri's and the insurance and hospital can't get it right without involving us and yeah, yeah.  Now for the meat and potatoes,  the onc tells us that the tx is working, one brain met is gone, 30 % shrinkage in the liver!  So I'm getting ready to do cartwheels and my wife says \" I'm not going to get excited until the next scan.  ??!!??  We must not be on the same roller coaster.  Seven different treatments and heard the word stable only once.  This chemo tx is kicking the stuffing out of her (and the cancer) and she has been able to cut her pain meds in half.  Next scan is in August sometime and I'm in a holding pattern worrying about the next scan way to early. Man...  Good luck too all, this site is amazing. sideline husband Log in to post a reply",

Forgot to say Phase 2 - MK 2206 and Phase 1 - MM303  or 302",
