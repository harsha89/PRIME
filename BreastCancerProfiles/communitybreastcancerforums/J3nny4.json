I'm a late joiner to this board, but I started chemo on June 3rd and will be continuing through November 11th so I wanted to be a part of this group. Hope to meet those of you going through the same thing at the same time. Thanks, Jenn",

But, then, i didn't have nausea with AC, but i had terrible headaches, that chemical drugged feeling and exhaustion. For those of you who are following my treatment plan (see below) and have had at least two treatments of Taxol already, after having AC first, do you remember how you felt the days after the second treatment? I have my second treatment of Taxol on September 2nd. I will be flying across the country the day after and \"running\" (walking) in a 10k on day four. I know we are all different, but i thought i would get your input on how you guys felt. Thanks!
