I will follow up with Doctor Tomorow and thank you for pointing out what reports to ask for and copies to obtain . Again thank you for putting my mind at rest . I'm looking after a very dear friend with Stage 4 breast cancer . I go down for all her appotments in LA . She is doing really well to treatment but a never ending roller coaster for her . I think it was a shock to me to get a recall on my Mamo as have gone since I was 40 years old . I just turned 49 . I feel the gentleman who read my Untrasound was insensitive and extreamly cold which threw for a loop with worry . Forward with a cure ♥     Thanks DAY ",

I had the mamo and ultra sound completed last Tuesday . No cancer come back in 6 months . Confused and worried . I'm seeing my regular doctor Tomorow Tuesday 21 January to review report . Otherwise I feel I'm reading every breast cancer website . The gentleman who read my ultrasound had zero bed side manner and told me that it wasn't cancer come back in 6 months and walked out the room . I just burst into tears !!! My mother had breast cancer 4 years ago and is cancer free.  Thinking of you .     ",
