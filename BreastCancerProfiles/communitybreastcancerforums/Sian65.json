I cancelled the post-op meeting with him as I wanted to get the pathology report from my oncologist not him..... had to wait an extra week for results but it was worth it to get the news (bad as it turned out) from someone with empathy. The best bit is that it was the BS's nurse who suggested that I cancel the appointment with him and get the report from my onc....",

Ah well ... Such is life! I can't afford to get caught in the stats... Just live well and keep on keeping on... anyway I figure I could get run over by a bus tomorrow so why fixate on BC ;) Teeballmum so glad to hear you like your nurses they are really important. I got a wig but wore it once yuk! I wore scarves. My sister had bc first diagnosed when her kids were 12 & 6 she was always very honest with them and they handled it pretty well. She died in 1999 when they were 11 & 17 they had a rough 2-3 yrs but both are very stable now and talk very normally about their mum. Not a perfect childhood for them but they are both good, successful and happy people.",

My first chemo failed (viable cells in lympnodes after chemo) so my onc put me on Navelbine and Xeloda.  I have had pretty bad left hip pain (not in my joint) since end of February - began as intermittent and mainly at night, gradually becoming pretty constant (sometimes both hips).  I have told my onc this several times and he kind of ignored it until last visit when I told him that I was pain free for 4 days after my second cycle of Navel/Xloda (from days 9-12) - he said \"well lets see what happens next time\".  So this cycle I have been pain free for 6 days (days 9 - 16 which is today) although I am starting to get a little twinge in my hip tonight.  Anybody else get this effect? So my two main questions - if the pain in my hip has gone in line with the chemo cycles this suggests the drugs are working BUT this also really means there was something there for them to work on....right?   I feel silly to be jumping to bone mets.... It seems so paranoid because I haven't even finished initital treatment (even though I began last October), but treatment has not gone so well and the staging isn't so good.  Should I insist to my onc that I get a scan of my hip? ",

The hip pain came back yesterday after about 10 days of being pain free.  I am guess I am worried that if it is an undiagnosed bone met I only have one more cycle of chemo to go before I switch to radiation.  So I might then develop resistence to Navelbine and/or Xeloda because of \"incomplete\" treatment.  I have already failed with Taxotere and Epirubicine and I don't want to add Navelbine and Xeloda to the list! I guess I am paranoid because my story over the past year has just been as series of worse and worse news... I began as StageIIA but I kept getting upgraded to now be IIIC.  I am worried because they found lots of viable cells in the lymphnodes after 6 rounds of neoadjuvant chemo... that was found Feb 16th.. I didn't begin chemo again until end of March and still have not had any radiation.  So I have had viable cancer in me for a long, long time - at least 13 months (my breast mass first appeared in April 2011 but I was in Pakistan then and chose to get back to Sweden before acting .- a 5 month delay that I hope I don't regret).  I think I shall talk to my onc about the drug reistence worry and just see what he says - and keeping reminding myself that I really do trust him and he knows a million times more about this than I ever will :-)",

I have three white marks on my skin one along mx scar and two other in general mx area. I noticed the first about 2 week after I finished my last cycle of chemo (navelbin & xeloda) and began rads that week also. The marks look like grains of rice - began as flat marks but have become raised and elongated. I also have spider veins (telangiectasia) surrounding one of the marks and running along the bottom of where my breast line used to be.  The veins showed up about 3 months after mx, well before I began rads (I know these veins can form with rads).  My sister died of BC and she had the exact same marks (just many, many more plus some brown ones) on her body and called them skin mets. I am currently undergoing rads for the primary.  I spoke to my onc (he's excellent) a week after I noticed the first mark - he found the one on my scar line and I found the third about a week ago.  He offered a biopsy; (I was not eager as it is summer holiday here so the labs are slow and my onc was going on holidays) so he suggested to wait and see of they grow and to see him again first week August if they have (that's when he's back from holidays)... he seemed a little worried to be honest. Meant to write.... one mark has changed shape, the other two have not (one of them only appeared about 10 days ago by the way - there seem to be other marks nearby too but they are too small to see properly). and the veins have been reacting to the rads (shrinking just a little but then back to as they were plus a little, little bit more each time - this cycle has happened about 3 times over the past 3 weeks of rads.   Sooo questions - Have any of you had skin mets that began like this? Could the rads be inhibiting the growth that my onc said to watch for?  Should I see my onc in August?",

NicolaJane.co.uk have nice trianing swimsuits - I got one and the straps stay put or you could just do the old trick ans tie a ribbon between the back straps or restitch them to cross over.  NicolaJane also have a good cheap training foob - it is weighted foam... I use it for swimming (always) and running/cycling/weights (sometimes).  It doesn't pop out in the pool but it might in the surf... then again I always check both sides coming out of the surf ;) Worth remembering that you should train with proper chest balance for muscle development. Therefore I usually do land based training with my proper prosthesis (although no running now as my hip is kaput). Please be really careful getting back into training - you can actually create potential for lymphodema by pushing your arm mobility too fast and stretching the facia to quickly.  I was told not allowed to go back in the pool for training until 8 weeks after my mastectomy - but everyone is different.  Easy lapping though can help your scapula from sticking.",
