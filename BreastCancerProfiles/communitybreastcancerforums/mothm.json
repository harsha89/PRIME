    "Content": "mothm wrote: My mammogram was normal but my ultrasound was BI-RADS 4. A solid lump of 1 cm and of increasing viscosity was seen. I had my needle aspiration this morning and the aspirate was a thickish fluid with blood. Its been sent for testing. The lump didn't disappear after aspiration but it collapsed significantly. Does the blood in the aspirate mean cancer? Would appreciate any inputs as I am all nerves waiting for the results. Thanks Log in to post a reply",
