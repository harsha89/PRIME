I mean, I have four kids, my youngest being autistic and won't allow anyone to do anything for him except me, cries when I'm out of his line of vision, etc... I couldn't fathom not being here for him. the next morning I woke up with anxiety and on the brink of tears all day. But then, I talked myself down. I realized I was, first of all, jumping to grave conclusions without any indicators of it being anything grave. Not only that, but say it IS something... I'm worried about dying, what happens when I'm gone, rather than worrying about living and making the most of the days I have. I'm. It guaranteed tomorrow, nor is anyone. I could lose my life to a car accident or anything really, I don't live my life dwelling on this possibilities, so why do it over this? And lastly, I decided that no matter the Dx (or lack thereof), I have to mentally prepare to fight and not give death an option. Losing is not an option. I have four kids that need me, so if it is cancer now (or ten years from now), it is a battle I will fight and win. I refuse to allow it to define my life. Does that make sense? I've battled through some very tough things in life, and I can battle this if I need to.",

      "Content": "Tessiedawn wrote: A few months ago, I noticed my nipple on my right breast beginning to point to the right and has gradually been sinking in on the right side. I have never done self exams (foolish), but happened to notice several lumps in my right breast. Some smallish and harder (fed like buckshot under the nipple and under the right side of areola), then a larger mass deeper, close to rib cage, and several lumps all over breast, including a couple in my armpit area, bordering breast and armpit. I feel similar lumps in my left breast as well, aside from the buckshot feeling ones under the nipple, those are only right side. I guess I'm most concerned with my nipple changing characteristics on me. I'm 35, started hormonal bc at 16, have four kiddos. My youngest is 3, I bf him until he was 18mo, and my left breast still produces milk. My right recently stopped producing (past month or so). I have an appt with my OB for an emergency breast exam, they are squeezing me in. Is it common to have BC in both breasts? Or more common to have it in just one side? I'm not sure what to think right now. I've been staying mostly calm, trying not to dwell on things I've read. Most lumps feel medium to soft, not squishy, not hard. The ones under nipple are smaller and harder. Log in to post a reply",

It's been nearly two years since I weaned him. I just did some more in depth examining with my arm above my head and found more buckshot type lumps around my armpit, along with a cluster of what feel like swollen nodes. I wouldn't be too concerned if the other side mimicked it in the way it feels, but there seems to be quite a bit more going on on the right side (including the uncharacteristic nipple). I guess I will find out more tomorrow. Hoping for good news, on the heels of an upcoming trip to Florida and Disney next week, would hate to have test results hanging over my head. But at least it would be a good distraction I guess. Cancer and pre cancer run rampant in my moms side of the family, but no breast cancer I'm aware of.",

Hopefully, if there is something found in the right breast, it is low level and not invasive... Or something completely non cancerous. I already had cancer in situ on my cervix several years ago and had leep to remove it. The nipple change, like I said, I noticed it several months ago, but legitimately had NO idea it was a sign of anything more serious than just aging with a body who has had four babies and nursed two of them. If not for finding the lumps, I never would have had a clue it was cause for Concern. Hoping it is just caused by my milk drying up and causing a change in the milk ducts or something. I'm just preparing for the worst and praying for the best. I can't change whatever it is, if anything, and no matter what, things will work out how they are meant to. I have to trust that God knows my kids need me, especially my autistic son. That is my biggest fear to face in life, leaving this world when that boy needs me so much.",

According to him, none of the lumps are characteristic of malignant lumps. There are many, he did confirm that (which I already knew), and said he believes them to be cystic. He is mostly concerned with the change in nipple, and that it can quite often be an indicator of more serious problems. And of course I had to tell him I am still producing milk nearly two years after weaning. After the exam, he said he was unable to express the milk during the exam. I said, well, I can. Lol he says \"show me\". I'm like ðŸ˜³ \"huh, really?\" Yeah, well, I squirted him right in the eye. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜­ Oopsies. Anyway, he ordered lab work to test prolactin levels, and two different thyroid tests. Should know those results tomorrow. He said even though he feels the lumps are cystic, the nipple alone is cause for concern and further testing. So, I go for an ultrasound a week from today. What should I expect? I believe it is not all that uncommon to find things in ultrasound that can not be or were not felt during exam? Is that correct or no? There are what I believe to be swollen lymph nodes in my armpit, but he didn't say much about those. He didn't deny that's what they were, but didn't confirm it either. I'm not freaking out or overly anxious about it, just curious about others' experiences.",
