Please describe to me what exactly your lump felt like to you or your doctor.  It was firm and didn't move...and there wasn't one in the opposite breast either. 3. Is there a family history?  Not in the immediate family, I was the first.  I had a paternal aunt that had it years ago but that was it as far as I know.",
