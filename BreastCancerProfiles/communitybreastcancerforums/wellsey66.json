The last time I posted was in Oct.  I finished radiation in November.  I have kept busy with classes at Life with Cancer.  I follow some of you on FB.  I don't post much but I use it to keep up others and with bull riding.  I was shocked to hear about Jennifer.  She was so young.  I had never met her yet I still felt a loss. Every where I go I tell my story about my bull rider and how he helped me get through breast cancer One Jump At A Time.  In April we went to an event in Tampa where I met up with some of my friends from FB and Twitter.  I got to meet JB's dad.  I told him how much his son meant to me.  Later he asked if I had a sharpie and a friend handed him one. Tim handed me his hat and the pen and asked if I would autograph his hat.  He said the fans were important and he always wanted to remember me.  In June there was an event 8 hours away and my husband didn't want to go so I decided to go all by myself, something I never would have done before.  I drove myself and stayed in a hotel by myself and met up with friends from FB and Twitter that I had never met before.  Best of all I got to see JB ride and win the event and I got to spend time with his Mom.  Everywhere I go I tell the story of JB and how One Jump At A Time got me through breast cancer.  I talk about him at support group.  My story got back to the PBR (Professional Bull Riders)  They are going to do a big campaign for breast cancer month and they are going to use my story.  They are going to do a press release on the story and introduce me on the dirt with the riders when they kick off their breast cancer program on Oct 1.  They are going to do a line of merchandise with One Jump At A Time.  This has not been released yet and I would appreciate it if you would keep it here on the boards and not let it get out on FB yet.  I don't want anything on FB until the PBR makes the announcement.  Most of my friends on FB are with the PBR.  Everyone has been after me to write up my story and now the PBR is doing it for me and using it to launch a program to support breast cancer.  I am just over whelmed and I wanted to share it with all of you.  I don't know any of the details yet, but I don't think anything is going to happen until Oct 1.  The event will be televised, but they usually don't show the opening ceremony on the TV.  Last year they talked about the breast cancer program through out the event.  This year I am going to be there in person.  So far I have only told my family and a very few trusted friends.  As soon as I learn more details, I will keep you posted.  I hope everyone is doing well and moving forward One Jump At A Time.

Also interesting article on lymph node transplant. Had never hear of that before. I am having trouble swallowing pills and I haven't started rads yet.  Mine is irritation from the chemo. Lenna My onc gave me a Rx for Silverdine cream to use on my nails.  It is a burn cream.  I used the Elasto-gel gloves on my hands but did not use them on my feet so I am still using the Silverdine.  They said to use it for 2 months after chemo LibraryJenn  I also used the Elasto-gel gloves on my hands, but did not start using them until the second treatment, so I went one treatment without them and my nails are fine. I finished my last chemo 3 weeks ago.  I had my rads work up this week.  I got no restrictions on deodorant, but they took me off of any supplements with hight antioxidants.  They recommended a cream Calendula by Boiron.  What creams did anyone else get?  My rads will start next week. We went to FL for a week after my last chemo.  I got out and walked on the beach everyday.   Last weekend we went to watch bull riding and I got to meet JB's sister.  She took me behind the scenes and I got to chat with their Mom and hang out with the riders.  Jessi's husband came out with a bull rope.  I had never seen a bull rope up close so Shane put the rope over my shoulder and Jessi took a pic and posted it on facebook.  Shane is the #11 bull rider is the world.  How exciting is that!  I got to see JB again and he has now moved up to #2 and is only 64 points from the lead.  JB's perseverance is getting me through this trying time in my life One jump at a time.",

Njbhwgirl  So sorry to hear about your Mom.  Please let us know how she is doing. Irishtess  Gosh 12 out of 30--You are just about half way there.  You asked how I got into bull riding.  Well I was flipping channels one night several years ago and found a show Celeberty Bull Riding with Ty Murry (Dancing with the Stars last year) and Cody Lambert, both founding fathers of the PBR (Professional Bull Riders not Pabst Blue Ribbon)  I had the honor of meeting Cody Lambert when I was in Charlottesville last week.  I was fascinated that guys actually rode bulls for a living and was amazed at the strength of the bulls and in awe of the bull fighters who stay in the arena to attract the bull away from the rider once he is down.  I just started following and learning the bulls and the riders and the bull fighters.  JB just stood out for me.  He is a spunky kid with more try than you can imagine. When they interview him he is just so humble.  He just loves to ride bulls.  He just became my favorite and then when I heard the story of One jump at a time it made me like him even more.  Then when I found out I had BC and was overwhelmed with everything I just remember JB and One jump at at time so he is my inspiration.  Even when he gets bucked off he comes back with a smile and is ready to go again and I decided that is the way I needed to be to beat this thing that has taken over my life.  The top 10 bull riders in the world will be riding tomorrow afternoon on CBS.  It is one of the few times that it is broadcast on a national network.  It is only an hour.  Take time to watch it and you will have a chance to see JB.  They will ride again on CBS on Oct 17 in NYC.  Again just the top 10.  Then the Finals start in Vegas the following week.",

I entered a contest with a Flat Stanley type character and I actually won the weekly contest.  I took Flat Keith Shivers to chemo with me and I won tickets to a Professional Bull Riding event of my choice.  They have now posted the 11 weekly winners on the pbr web site and the one who gets the most votes will win tickets to the finals in Vegas.  I am a BIG bull riding fan.  It is the only sport I like.  The site is www.pbrnow.com/keithshivers If anyone could vote for me I would greatly appreciate it.  I would love to win tickets to Vegas.  I am week 5 reading Pro Bull Rider at chemo.  It would be great to be able to go to Vegas for 5 days and forget about cancer I had a PET scan on Sat and it came back negative.  My son came home to visit last weekend and I am going to see my Mom this weekend.  Never a dull moment.  I try to take advantage of the good weekends.  Next week will be chemo #5 so that will be a lousy weekend, but we are planning on going camping the following weekend and hope to go to a bull riding event in NC over Labor Day weekend.",

Jenn I was given Silverdine cream to use on my nails twice a day.  They told me not to use polish during chemo.  I guess everyone has their own set of ideas. Some of you mentioned mouth problems.  During the first 2 chemos when I lost my taste buds, my tongue felt like it had a fuzzy growth on it.  Once I started keeping ice in my mouth during treatment, I didn't have any more mouth problems.  It saved my taste buds and no more fuzzy tongue. Day My tumor markers hit 41 before they ordered the PET/CT scan but it still came back negative. I had a wonderful weekend with my 89 year old Mom and now back to reality and chemo on Thursday.",

I measures 2 teaspoons of water in each cube.  I use the Tupperware ice tray, but if you have an ice maker you can buy ice trays at Dollar Tree.  I keep ice in my mouth during the entire drip.  I start 15 min before the T starts and when the ice cube get small I add another.  I never let my mouth warm up.  I make sure my entire mouth is cold by swishing the ice all around my mouth and tongue and gums.  I just keep adding ice the entire time and I keep adding ice for 15 minutes after the C drip is over just like they do for the ice caps for your head.  Try different size ice cubes at home.  I found that a full size ice cube was too big.  I couldn't close my mouth and I would drool!!  Crushed ice didn't work because it melted too fast.  They let me put my ice and Elasto-gel gloves in the freezer in the room so I don't have to carry dry ice.  I have a big Tupperware tumbler that I put a frozen wine cooler thing around to keep the cubes from melting while I am eating them.  The wine cooler thing also helps me pick up the tumbler with my gloves on.  This week I am also wearing a sinus mask from Elasto-gel to see if I can save what is left of my eyebrows.  I am quite the sight at chemo.",

I am starting to get a growth of fuzz on my head.  Is that really hair while I am still in treatment or is it just an attempt at hair that will fall out after the last chemo? I saw an ad for Rapidlash.  Anyone try it? Day I hope you are recovering well from your surgery. I saw your faries and trolls. You are amazing. Packjen & Sacphotomom Congrats on your anniversaries.  We just celebrated our 40th. Paxton I can't imagine going through this with a litlle one.
