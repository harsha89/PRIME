Second, my rad onc ordered 16 treatments to the left breast and 5 \"boost\" treatments to the tumor site, for a total of 21.  There should be no difference in any side effects.  He said that women with larger breasts (I was a 34/C) are not eligible for the shorter course but I have forgotten the reason.  He also said that the dose is adjusted to be biologically equivalent to the longer course of treatment.  I chose the shorter course because I want to get this over with!   Good luck to you! ",

What worries me more is that I can see two stringy things (tendons?) pop up between my upper arm and my armpit when I raise my arm sideways above parallel to the floor.  They are invisible on the non-surgery arm and appeared about a week after I started my Amer. Cancer Soc. stretching exercises.  It also hurts and I'm worried about making things worse, so I am going to email my nurse again.   On the other hand, I know I am very lucky compared to so many other women!  Best to you all... ",
