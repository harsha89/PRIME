I had a lumpectomy April 25th then when I needed reexcision surgery decided to go ahead and do a double mastectomy with implants. Had my mastectomy Tuesday. Much more pain this time around plus drains are the disadvantages but I'm still glad I changed my mind. With lumpectomy you usually need radiation, which affects reconstruction choices a lot. Good luck!",
