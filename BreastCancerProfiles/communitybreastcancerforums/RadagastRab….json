Beeline- hope u feel better soon, I think my anxiety too will lessen with one under the belt. Set to start first AC treatment on the 27th at 10am. Come in day before for chemo class, blood work and hormone therapy shot to put me into chemopause. 25th I get my port. Big week next week. Just have ultrasound to confirm size this Friday. Everyone has been nice. I definitely recommend hooking up with a nurse navigator if ur oncologist offers one, she has been wonderful and helping me deal with things happening to me outside the chemo chair. Thinking of all u and looking forward to celebrating with all of u too once we finish. Looking forward to that victory bell",

Going through the infusion was less scary than I thought, not much discomfort from neulasta. Have been having what if days too, we go through so much and cannot predict the future. But we do what we can. I know I personally have been leaning into my faith in Christ more than ever, really helps. Hang in there ladies, we\u2019ll get there together!!",

I chopped mine off completely the day I started chemo just to get it over with, kinda liking the coolness on top of my head but not brave to go bald in public yet. Loving the animal pictures too! Feeling antsy and tired, come off steroids today see how that goes. Enjoyed some moes southwest grill yesterday, it was awesome. Taste buds are off and on but for most part on. No other issues other than tired and sticking on a schedule with nausea meds. I keep telling myself 3 more times of AC, I just wish I was there already sometimes. We are doing it ladies, day by day we will get there and the celebration will be glorious at the end. You ladies embody bravery, u can do it",

Need to shrink before surgery. Chest wall attachment possible because when I lift my right arm where my tumor is 6 O clock right breast it indents underneath. Mri shows no skin thickening. CT scans clear for anything else. Breast mri shows nothing in left and no swollen lymph nodes either side, no tumors other than the one in right breast. I am young and scared and shocked. Lots going on including my houses roof failing. Having to have treatment out of state with family ( mother in law, she's great) away from my husband while house is being repaired from water damage. Both of us are struggling emotionally. I am terrified of ac chemo, need to know it's doable not so scary. Need to know I have good outlook",

Piksie- I hope u continue to enjoy little side effects, thank u for sharing about how things are going for u. It's the fear of the unknown that has me. But as everyone keeps trying to tell me one step in front of the other. Trying to stay positive but go through many moments of being overwhelmed. Afraid to take the steps but know I must. Dry heaves tonight. Might take oncologist up on anti anxiety medicatio",

I completed AC chemo and now am on the weekly Taxol but I thought i would write about my experience with AC to help other ladies get through the treatment. Nausea- My symptoms started a few hrs after the infusions. Even with pre-meds within an hr or two I was starting my nausea meds. Definitely take them on a schedule and don't wait to be nauseous or you'll be hanging over a toilet quickly. Keep food in your stomach. Sip a soup or nibble on saltine crackers if eating is hard. Keeping a full stomach HELPS the nausea alot. Hair loss - I shaved my head to a buzz cut before I started Chemo, because I had long hair I thought it would be traumatic for me to see long clumps of hair fall out. So I took my own hair, one thing I had control over and I felt that it put me in \"Fight Mode\". The Buzzed bits fell out shortly after AC #2. But the first hair to fall out actually was down below and the hair loss worked its way up the body and the last to fall out was my buzzed hair bits. I kept my eyebrows and eyelashes until the start of Taxol #1. Lack of Energy- I precooked batches of meals for myself beforehand. Enough to last me at least a week. Reheating in a microwave was such a blessing as opposed to cooking. Either a cassarole or something similar- lunch kits - with a sandwich, fruit, chips, and a cookie along with a bottled water, easy to grab and eat. Salad kits with everything chopped up I just needed to put the dressing on it. Mini ice cream cups as a treat, portion controlled but really helped when I really felt like poo. Sometimes having a favorite meal really can perk you up so sometimes I'd do that too, to try and make things feel as normal as I could make them. I found protein shakes and gatorade helpful too. I was drained for energy right up until the day before the next infusion starting from AC #2. I rebounded pretty quickly from AC #1 but from there on it took longer each time with the worst being AC #4. Food Sensitivity- One of the biggest pains in the butt was the Acid Reflux. Your MO should prescribe you something for it but even with the prescription Prilosec I still experienced awful Acid Reflux. I found things like OJ and tomato based things would especially irritate it. Sometimes a cold glass of milk helped calm things down. I didn't really experience things tasting \"off\" I just found that I craved food that was unusual for me to want. GI issues- I mostly dealt with constipation on AC. Senekot with the stool softner helped. Also drinking as much water as I could get down helped with keeping things moving. AC wasn't easy to get through, its one of the toughest protocols out there, but for those of you going through AC, I have found Taxol to be much easier in terms of side effects. Once I was on the other side of AC and had recovered a bit I really felt great and felt so proud for getting through it. You can do it ladies!! :) ",

Yep, even being a slightly seasoned chemo lady I find being positive sometimes still challenging, I mean this crap is hard, it makes you feel like poo and sometimes it feels like time is standing still and like it'll never be over. One thing I would I constantly remind myself is that this whole chemo thing is a temporary reality, not my final reality :) Sometimes this helped, sometimes it didn't - The emotional toll this takes on the mind and the body, totally normal! :) Give yourself permission to cry, yell, punch a pillow, whatever it takes, sometimes letting those feelings out helps with coping and pressing forward. How far along are ya? You can do it!! :)",
