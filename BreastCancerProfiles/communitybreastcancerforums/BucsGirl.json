I also forgot to mention that I did work from home the last 2 weeks of radiation therapy. I'm probably one of the few who had a rougher time with radiation than chemo. I was very sore towards the end. Most people don't get radiation burns, but I did. I had them under my breast and under my arm. I couldn't wear a bra towards the end of it, and there was no way I was going to walk into the office without a bra. Some people can pull that off, but I'm too top heavy. Ruth - I went to the Look Good, Feel Better class too. I thought it was very informative. They give you a makeup kit worth about $200. I got some really nice makeup colors. I just wish I would have picked the lighter kit (instead of the medium). Medium was way too dark for me. My face got really pale during chemo.",

I hope you can find one that you like. I did, but it wasn't a lace front wig. I didn't know the difference in the beginning. I do know now that they have them, but wasn't actually looking for them at the time. They also had some with human hair. I believe the brand was Pantene. If you don't find what you're looking for at the local chapter, then I'd definitely go to a wig shop. I ended up at the wig shop because I found that my insurance covered the cost of it. I figured that 2 wigs are better than 1.",

We work in cubicles, and my manager understood my concerns about catching any airborne viruses. I did the whole FMLA thing (just for job protection) and only took off 1 day a week (infusion day). Most of it went to my PTO. I started in December and didn't have a whole lot of PTO left. I was able to get 5 days donated to me for that month (just in case I needed it). I only used 3 of them.  I had my infusions on Friday so that I could rest up on the weekend. I would still be weak on Monday & Tuesday. I'd start to feel better on Wednesday. I was actually happy about it. It kept my mind going. The chemo fog made me forget a couple of conference calls here and there, but everyone was understanding. I didn't go back into the office until the day I started radiation therapy. I haven't been sick at all through treatment. I'm still taking Herceptin every 3 weeks, but I do that on Thursday now. Everyone in our department works from home 1 day a week. My work at home day is Friday. My only suggestion would be to get the flu shot prior to chemo. Neulasta sounds like a good option too. I fortunately did not need it. Hope this helps in your decision. It's all quite a journey.",

I was told by the nurse at my MO's office to check them out first before spending a ton of money at the wig stores. They'll help you with trying on different wigs to see which one is right for you. My hubby was with me, and it was a hoot of a session. We laughed a lot! One of the wigs made me look like Joan Jett (her rock style from the 80's). I ended up spending more money anyway for a lace front wig, and it wasn't even human hair. My insurance did cover it using CPT code A9282 with a description of \"Hair Prosthesis for induced chemotherapy\". The MO's prescription read \"Cranial Prosthesis\" with ICD 10 - 50.919. Not sure if this helps or not. You have a great hubby. I don't know what I would have done without mine. Hang in there. It will be over before you know it.",

      "Content": "Jul 15, 2017 07:36AM - edited Jul 15, 2017 07:37AM by BucsGirl I am so happy to see this subject. I'm getting a fitting and demonstration for the FlexiTouch pump system on Monday. I'm assuming I will need the full torso. I have lymphedema of the breast (not the arm). I was on the fence about doing this, but now I'm eager about purchasing it after reading the results. It was recommended to me by the lymphedema therapist at BayCare. I'll update everyone once I get it (and start using it). I have very dense breast tissue, so hopefully this does the trick. As the therapist said, it's very difficult to do this on yourself. I just can't hurt myself (I guess). RebaMacFan - I was told by my RO not to get lymphedema therapy during radiation therapy. It's too much of an irritant during that phase. I'm post radiation therapy. I can tell you that the tissue hardens up during this time. Maybe it's because the swelling is in my radiated breast and not the arm.",
