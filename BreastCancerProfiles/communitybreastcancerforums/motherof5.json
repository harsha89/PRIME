I have mets to the liver, pancreas, bone and several other areas, but my liver is 75%-plus full of tumors. That is the big issue. My Dr. is wonderful but is always surprised when I tell her how tired I am. Is there something wrong with me or is everyone else out there tired all the time, too???? I used to have tons of energy, so I know it isn't a personal issue. I don't think I'm depressed, either. I have five kids ranging in age from 7-15 and there's much to do around the house. I don't work outside the home, but my kids definitely keep me busy and out of bed. If not for them, though, I don't think I'd ever get up! Please give me some practical insight!!!! Thank you!
