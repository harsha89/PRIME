I too was undecided about reconstruction. Other women I know were recommending it, but I was skeptical, and medically, I was advised not to start recon until completion of 33 radiation sessions.  Long story short, I tried the breast forms, and found them uncomfortable after surgery. My incision sites and skin were sensitive, and I felt like every one was looking at my chest.  I liked not wearing a bra (less laundry too).   I think this is a very personal decision. Going breast free was not an easy decision, but there are many ways to live fully without breasts.  No one wants a breast cancer diagnosis or mastectomy, but the reality is it happens to the best of us.  What we CAN control is how we define ourselves, and not let cancer define us. ",
