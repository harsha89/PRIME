As for pink, I've never been able to equate it with BC -- someone chose a nice, youthful pastel color and capitalized on it -- brilliant marketing that has nothing to do with actual breast cancer patients, survivors, sufferers.  It's just, as my dear late mother would have said, a bunch of crap.",

I had my implant removed at the end of October and have had to look at my chest every night for awhile now to change some sort of dressing due to various complications after the surgery.  It's really odd, but I seem to go into a \"clinical\" mindset when I look in the mirror and do whatever needs to be done.  It's like taking care of someone else's wound and then when it's covered again I go back to seeing myself in the mirror again.  Hope I haven't lost my mind, but this is what happens every single night.  The skin in my chest is pretty tight, loaded with hard scar tissue, multicolored and still has a very fresh and ugly scar.  I know exactly what it looks like, but it just doesn't seem like a part of me at this particular time.  Weird, but it is working until my brain is ready for the reality of this new and strange looking side of my chest.

It's great to catch up with your posts and see that we are all going through similar things. -Bonnie ",

Cinda - I'm so sorry about the loss of your dog.  It is so hard to lose pets, especially so close together.  Thank goodness your husband got that new puppy. I admire those of you who go bald, but I'm in the same spot as Elaine on this one.  I only go bald in the shower or tub!  Scarves, hats and the occasional wig day work for me the rest of the time.  This has been a long, tiring week of too much work and not enough sleep, but I'm taking tomorrow off and sleeping as long as my body wants to sleep.  The neuropathy is still bothering me at night, but I haven't called the onc yet.  My last Tx is scheduled for 2/19 and it won't happen if the neuropathy gets worse.  My thinking is that if a good night's sleep is possible tonight without all the leg writhing and cramping, then I'm good to go.  Otherwise, I'll call and tell them what's going on.  SEs have been terrible for me this time -- nausea, vomiting, upset stomach, body aches, extreme fatigue, insomnia, etc., plus the nasty taste in my mouth 24/7.  It's a drag, but it's good to know there is a sisterhood out there experiencing similar things. Take care. ~Bonnie",

I'm on Femara and also experience terrible joint pain.  The onc sent me to a rheumatologist who dx'd my pain as osteoarthritis in most joints.  Celebrex and other NSAIDS offer much more relief than the pain meds for me, but NSAIDS are really hard on the stomach so I've been using an anti-inflammatory patch (Flector) that seems to work fairly well for back and neck pain.  Activity also helps, but it's hard when things don't want to move.   Happy belated birthday!  Hope you will let us know what the arthritis specialist has to say.   ",

I tried false eyelashes too and decided they are just way too much trouble.  My lashes and brows are really thin and there are some empty spots, but that's just how it's going to be for awhile.  The brows are pretty easy to cover with wig bangs or fill in with a pencil and powder.  The lashes may just go missing for awhile.

Bobbi -- I think it is great that you are starting a new career at 52 -- being a vet tech sounds like a great job! Cat -- There's no getting around the fact that wigs are pretty fake, but my rationale is that I feel better out in public in my wig.  I don't get the stares and sideways glances that make me so uncomfortable when I'm in a hat or scarf, and that makes it worth it.  My preference at home and with friends and family is still to wear the hats and scarves or a turban.  The Lorazepam doesn't make me groggy in the morning either, but I prefer Lunesta because it helps me stay asleep longer and also doesn't make me groggy the next day. Elaine -- Hot flashes suck!  I had hot flashes and night sweats on and off for years and now they are back with a vengeance.  My covers are off and on 20 times a night!  Good luck with your TX tomorrow. Firni -- I'm sorry you are having such a difficult time right now.  My thoughts and prayers are with you.  Feel better soon. This thread has been quieter than usual lately, and I suppose it is because some of the usual contributors are done with TX.  I finished last week, but am still having SEs and also dealing with some depression that is creeping in around the edges.  I like coming here and sharing and hope it is okay.  Being done with chemo, for me, is like having a safety net removed and now I have a month to wait before surgery and then another month before radiation.  I'm scared and can't seem to shake that feeling.  My hope was to take an early retirement later this spring when I turn 62, but my need for good medical insurance may mean that I have to keep working another 3 years.  I could get on my DH's policy, but he wants to retire too.  We've been married a very long time, so I'm hoping that he just needs a little time to think this all through so we can come to a decision that works for both of us.  My job has been a good distraction through these past months, but I don't particularly enjoy going to work every day and putting on a happy face when I feel like crap.  Sorry to complain.

DH and I were counting yesterday and I've had 6 procedures, including MX, since getting BC.  Most recently, I had implant removed 10/26 after 2nd capsular contracture and then got a huge hematoma that was washed out in another surgery earlier this week.  I'm done with \"immediate reconstruction\" procedures and am going for a prosthetic when everything is healed up. As for the vaginal dryness, my gyn prescribed vagifem and estrace cream, but I was so afraid of a recurrence that I didn't use them very long.  Replens didn't work for me, but we're still looking for something that will work.  Today my surgery side is very sore and I'm still \"wearing\" a JP drain, so must get well from all of this before doing much else. Have a wonderful day.....",

I, too, have lots of stubble with some bald spots.  I wear a hat or scarf most of the time, but several times a day I put a piece of newspaper in the bathroom sink and lean over it and massage my head to get the loose hairs out.  I don't think the hair will all come out until it is ready, but the massages feel good!  I keep reading that it is not a good idea to shave your hair all the way down or you might get ingrown hairs or an infection. Take care.  Good luck on your next treatment on Tuesday.  Mine is Wednesday. ~Bonnie",

Colleen -- Glad you are feeling better.  It's understandable that you are worried about the next 4 Txs, and I, too, hope they will be kind to you.  Take care of yourself and try not to overdo it with the laundry and housework.  Cat -- I had a single mastectomy with lymph node dissection in late October and could probably have gone back to work after two weeks, but a short time into the healing process an infection in my chest wall and necrosis of some skin on the incision necessitated another surgery and I was off an additional three weeks.  If everything goes as it should and most likely will for you, two weeks seems like a perfectly reasonable amount of time to be away from work  Glad your WBC was good this time!.

The steroids kept me up most of last night, as did the hot flashes and cold chills.  I asked the onc about the hot flashes and he said it is the chemo doing its work to get rid of the estrogen.  Chemo will be replaced by whatever hormone inhibitor he chooses, so the hot flashes and cold chills are going to be around for quite awhile. Flonase seems to have helped my nose quite a bit already -- no more constant dripping and the sinus pressure is better.  It could also be the steroids, which have also turned my face a nice, bright pink color and made me very hyper and hungry. Two of our three, fifteen year old cats are sick today with stomach problems.  The vet gave me some special food and it seems to be helping a little.  If they aren't better by tomorrow, we'll take them to the vet.  Having elderly pets is sometimes worrisome and expensive, but I wouldn't trade them for the world.
