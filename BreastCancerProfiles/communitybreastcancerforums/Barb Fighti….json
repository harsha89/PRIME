But I do it, every time, and somehow, life goes on. I understand your sadness about losing your hair again. I hate that, I think we all do.  But if I can give some encouragement... I think the key is keeping you alive. Lots of new medicines and treatments in the pipeline, and if you can keep beating it back, hopefully, they will find the treatment that really works for you one of these days, and in the meantime, it will have been worth fighting it off once again.   I think the steroids are for allergic reaction, and if you don't have a reaction, perhaps you can talk your doc out of the steroids. I put up a fight this last time, and my doc gave in... I remember my big square jaw from 11 years ago... so it might be worth asking if you can skip the steroids this time around.  They did insist on the benedryl, just in case. Perhaps that would be an option for you. Hang in there!",

We ran around trying to get 2nd opinions, but they all said the same thing.... which wasn't something I wanted to hear.   What I didn't realize was that it WAS NOT THE END OF THE WORLD.  It still totally sucks though.  Just to keep things in perspective though, my doc has several patients with 'bone only' mets that are out over 20 years.  Thanks for saying how annoying it was for your hubby to be the trooper with the shaved head, you totally cracked me up, I was actually laughing out loud. Glad to know that others also find their loved ones annoying - even though it's through no fault of their own. Still we are just human, right?! Good luck with it.",

It's just that sometimes we just want to vent, and can't do that with our family, because we hate to bring them down, too. I try to be strong. All the time. I always give my kids the 'best case scenario' and mostly I try to live each day thinking positively. Once in a while, though, I just need to cry. I have a sis who lets me do that, and it's a relief. I love your simple words... \"I love you and I care.\" I think that's pretty eloquent.  I also appreciate it when people admit that \"it sucks.\"  Thanks for sharing.",

      "Content": "Jul 27, 2008 08:13PM - edited Jul 27, 2008 08:14PM by Barb-FightingBC Ozzie, After initial diagnosis of bone mets, it was strictly \"hormone therapy\" which I think is still considered the gold standard for women who are ER+PR+.  And that simply means getting rid of all your hormones. So I had an oophrectomy (removal of ovaries) and took a pill, can't remember which one. That was effective for 21 months. Next was light chemo, which didn't do the trick, so they put me on Abraxane/Avastin, which worked almost 4 years. I was typically on treatment for about 4 months. After four months off, my counts would begin to rise, so it was back on 4 months. So typically, it was four months on and four months off. That treatment was very tolerable for me. I had very few side effects (other than hair loss) and felt pretty good most of the time. My red counts would fall toward the end of the cycle, and so I would get pretty anemic, but overall it was very doable. After my last round a couple of months ago, we discovered that the Abraxane/Avastin had not worked as it had in the past, so I was just switched to Ixempra. Had first infusion 2 weeks ago. It will be once every three weeks.  So far, I've felt pretty good. I had tender gums and teeth (which was corrected by taking Glutamine) and some aches and pains, but that was only the first few days and feeling 100% again. I did have progression to my liver about a year ago, but I still feel great. I generally work out several mornings each week and play golf several afternoons as well. I have just started juicing, which hasn't been easy, but I'm not giving up on that! I also have a researcher that looks for complementary/alternative things that can help, and I'm sending it in a private message to you Ozzie, so everyone doesn't get bored with me posting it!",

This is gonna crack you up, but after I had the first one, I felt really great. And NORMAL.  So the next time I was feeling a little tired, I was begging for another transfusion!!! It was no biggie for me, just a big bag of plasma or blood - whatever they call it - on a pole and it was a little slower than chemo. But I felt WAY better by the next day.  Totally worth it. Let us know how you feel after. I think you'll be smiling.",

Regarding your comment about soy in vitamin supplements, I am ER+PR+, and on advice of doc, I avoid products with soy. Apparently there is data that goes both ways, but since it isn't definitive, I avoid products containing soy. Don't know if it's enough to make a difference, but in this battle, I figure every little bit could help. Feel better!",

I was diagnosed with BC in 1997 and then with Bone Mets in 2002. That was 6-1/2 years ago.  It spread to my liver about a year ago and I'm still going strong. I know that everyone's situation is different, but metastases is not the end of the world. I thought it was, and I do tend to feel down every time I have a relapse... but it can be treated like a chronic disease - similar to diabetes.  Mets diagnosis seems hopeless, but it's not. I hope you can pass on to your friend that there are many of us living normal lives. Barb",
