I forgot to mention - I too am having hot flashes.  I have been told that this chemo will push me into menopause and then I'll get drugs to keep me there. I have no idea as to what this means really: hot flashes and moodiness? What else? Will I suddenly start to put on weight? Age faster?  ?? However, I am not thinking of these things that much right now. Mostly I am grateful that the side effects are manageable and even \"easy.\"  I realized that all this may change over the next few days...  Will keep you apprised.   Good luck to you and please keep me updated!",

There is some fatigue but I got my period yesterday and that may be the cause. Yesterday I learned I have a bladder infection (UTI) which, I was told, was not due to the chemo. The symptoms were burning when having to urinate and the feeling of having to urinate frequently. I have only had a similar infection once when I was eleven. The burning sensation started the night of the first chemo, so it's hard to believe it's unrelated to the chemo. In any case, I am on cipro and drinking cranberry juice and the discomfort has almost wholly gone away.  Redbarb: so sorry to hear about your back pains. I have had some mild back pains too, but nothing like what you're describing. I'll cross my fingers for you that it stops! Countryfrau - sorry to hear about your stomach aches.  I find that it helps to always have something in the stomach but never eat a big meal in one sitting. I don't know if that will help you...  fotopet - so so sorry to hear about your first day! I pray the second infusion goes much better for you! ",

I don't think my hair is showing any signs of falling yet, but can't be sure as I have long curly hair that sheds on a good day.  In any case, I am well armed with a super cool wig which makes baldness less awful to contemplate at the moment. This whole last week has been very uneventful. No pain at all.  Friends phone or stop by and sometimes seem both relieved and disappointed that I don't look the part. (Is she lying? maybe she has cancer lite). I figure a bit of baldness will help my cause.  Of course, I am joking, but there's nothing that screams cancer quite like a bald head.  Hi Paxton - welcome!  I'm so sorry about your situation - I hope you're taking meds for your yeast infection and mouth sores. Having a very small child must make this so much more trying. I hope you have friends and family you are reaching out to? fotopet - glad to hear you are doing better!   re: neulasta - I too had the shot in my tummy - didn't hurt at all. In fact, unlike what most of you describe, my neulasta shots take place immediately after the chemo - ie on the same day. I asked my doc why I didn't have to return the following day and she said waiting 24 hrs didn't make a difference.  Good night and sleep well ladies!",

I for one have a lot of questions for you May 2008 ladies, such as: how long did it take before your energy levels returned to pre-cancer state? If you went through chemopause, what was it like and what are its consequences? Did your hair eventually return to its pre-cancer texture and color? Do you regret any of your decisions about treatment?  I am sorry to deluge you with so many big order questions!!! Perhaps I need to wade through the discussion archives and all the answers to these questions are there!  presently, I am focused on the daily issues of chemo aches and pains but am aware that the bigger and longer-term questions are huge unknowns to me!!!",

Back to working full time and pretending that I am not a cancer patient (I have another week of hair, so pass easily as a civilian). Yes, I did get a bladder infection two days ago and a bloody nose out of nowhere today but  all these are minor irritations and I am joyful that I have what I hope will be two weeks of good sailing before the next infusion.  cf: I really enjoyed and appreciated your post - especially on the clinical trials but also your humor and writing. I hope you continue to post! I too approach the chemo with a \"bring it on\" bravado!   KristyAnn: thank you so much for generously addressing all the many questions I posed! Very interesting and useful information. fotopet: Thanks for the info on the ACS class. I definitely plan to take it! It is hard to work full time when cancer is a half time job (not to mention being a mom!) but I will gladly take out a few hours for this class. Overnight I was handed this new cancer identify that I didn't ask for but I just as well make the most of. I have bought a great wig (\"Erica\") and am thinking of getting one zany--perhaps purple or green--one to establish once and for all that I am not letting this cancer get the best of me!  In any case, I look forward to learning how to put on make up from a professional. Something about being hairless makes me look like I am at auschwitz (I have never been hairless but have \"practiced\" with a scarf). Some bright lipstick and glistening eyeshadow should help in that department! So it is Friday again and I hope all of you lovely women are able to enjoy the weekend without too much discomfort.  Also, I want to thank you all for openly sharing your stories. Like others, I have found them helpful and found this forum a source of comfort on what could be a lonely and frightening road.  ",
