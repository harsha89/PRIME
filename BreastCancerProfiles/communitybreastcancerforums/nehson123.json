I have been a nurse since 1977,worked mostly Peds my entire career,mostly Peds ER in a large regional pediatric center, I now am faculty at a nursing school where I do theory and clinical peds and med-surg. My diagnosis was aa shock.I am 8  weeks s/p Bilat. Mx.I am going back to work this wek. My energy level is pretty good. I still have TE's which I hate,very painful especially at night.Sleeping has been difficulty but I take benadryl every night to help. I was pleasantly surprised that even though I was a nurse I received so much guidance and information from everyone caring for me. I am barely numb except for my armpits which made my fills painful.My PS used EMLA at my request because I was such a mess at each  fill. My exchange is scheduled for 2/17.I am nervous  because it is another OR experience even though everyone says it is so much easier than the MX. Still worried about pain etc... Hope going back to work keeps my mind off of it for a while. Take Care Everyone Andrea",
