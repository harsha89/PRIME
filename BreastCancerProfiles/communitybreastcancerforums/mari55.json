Still, it is hard for me to see so many young women dealing with the spread of this disease.  I know your issues are different than mine since you have a young family and lots of years you want to spend with them. There is a woman who checks in every year who has lived with this for 17 years.  Right now there is no \"cure\" but there is control.  I have experienced significant regression in only 6 months.  I work and go on with my life because that's what you have to do. This forum will help you understand  more about any treatment that is prescribed for you and will give you a link to many wonderful women on the same journey.  First, I recommend finding doctors you trust and can talk too.  Learn bout your mets - is it hormone sensitive.  This dictates your treatment. I echo Holly's recommendations to look into some of the support groups for young women with this dreaded disease.  I check into this forum daily because I need to know I'm not alone on this rocky road and sometimes even the closest friends and most supportive family just can't understand.  Sending you hugs Mari ",

With some of us  tumor markers are very accurate and with others they are not.   Some oncologists never measure TMs. Some are followed by MRIs, some by CT, some by bone or PET. Scans can be dictated by insurance as well, as some find that a PET is not routinely covered by their insurance.  Hope this helps Mari ",

So unless I face paralysis I am going to avoid it.   Luckily I have not had to face that. The stenosis is better and I have very little discomfort except from the kyphosis ( curvature of the spine)  that is a result of the compression fracture. I can relieve it by stretching so far.  My last PET showed no new cancer and no activity in the thoracic spine specifically.  I did have to have stabilization of my hip ( Jan 2010)  which did involve pins and a rod. that runs from my hip to my knee.  It was a much easier surgery than I thought it would be ( In on Monday and out on Wednesday). I am back to exercising and I work full time.

Have spinal stenosis at T9 but that is not hitting the spinal cord. Haven't been on chemo that causes neuropathy so I have learned to live with it.  It may be from previous radiation or from the hardware in my right hip. It is better than when it started last August.  I have had acupuncture- that has helped some.  I have been on neurontin ( gabapentin), but have been weaning myself down becasue of SEs and don't see an increase in symptoms.  There is some data on a supplement acetyl-L carnitine ( google it or PM me and I will find the citations) and even a few clinical studies are in place looking at it in chemo induced neuropathy.  I take it and not sure if it is the supplement or what, but the neuropathy has at least gotten tolerable ( When it started it was all the way up my leg  and hip and affecting bladder function).  Sometimes it is the stuff that comes with treatment of this disease that is the most frustrating on a daily basis.",

My plastic surgeon is the one who told me this.  They won and I had the surgery with no problems last April. I sought a second opinion on my back ( I have a compression fracture at T9 and some increasing neuro symptoms) and I could tell that doctor saw stage IV and wrote me off.  The doctors that get to know me seem to get on board with the fact that I want aggressive treatment and wholistic treatment until I don't want it anymore.  I have reminded a few of them that no one knows when their time is up so as long as I am productive, working ( at home or at work) and not in horrible pain I want to be treated.

Most hospice  services have a medical director that writes the Rx's for pain and anxiety meds and Medicare does cover this.  If the mets is limited to what the PET showed I would say a year or more is reasonable.   You should not have to wing this by yourselves.

It is under Medicare part B and not every one opts to purchase this  Hospice is covered by Medicare and I am pretty sure it is under part A ( I work in the VA system so I have forgotten a lot of this) and  they can care for your mom in the home. They say 6 months estimated survival but I have a lung cancer patient who has been on for over a year.  On hospice however, you concede that you are dying and chemo, rads etc is not covered.  I am not sure how they view the antihormonals.  They do however, pay for all of the palliative care meds. I agree with talking to a home health agency (one with hospice may be able to give you the pros and cons of each).  Most oncologists have those they work with and you will need  a doctor's order to get an evaluation.  I also agree with Chickadee that being a caregiver is a tough job when it comes to the end of life.  Many of the assisted living and even skilled homes have improved  but you do have to visit often and ask lots of questions",
