I was taking the mini pill have done so for about 3 years prior to that had a mirena coil. My breasts felt swollen and large a bit like before you are due on and nipples were very tender. I have had a thickening feeling on the left side of my breast under my arm. I don't have periods due to the mini pill and haven't suffered from sore breasts etc. the doctor found a lump in my left breast and has referred me to the clinic within the 2 weeks since this has happened my breasts still fill sore but around the edges if that makes sense nipples are still tender but more so on the left. I have been getting a deep dull ache which also goes to. Sharp pain hard to describe my should and left arm also aches and feels like a \"dead\" arm. Any opinions will greatly received am I worrying unnecessarily? Any help gratefully received Log in to post a reply",

He said the left breast is lumpier than right he felt a couple of smaller round ones too but wasn't concerned about those. It is side of breast going towards under arm. He said ultrasound will give us an answer. He said mammo wouldn't show anything. I had this done but radiologist still needs to look I'm more worried now though coz the person who did said the left is definitely denser than the right I asked if there was anything to be worried about she said not massively the radiologist will look?! I now have a 2 week wait for the ultrasound:( Log in to post a reply",
