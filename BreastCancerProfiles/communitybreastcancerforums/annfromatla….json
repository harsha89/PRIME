It was between there and Nashville, the two site locations closest to me. The clinical trials director there (in Charleston) is really on the ball and had me in there for the trial in no time. I had my first treatment exactly one week ago today. I went into my local oncologist's office today for labs. A requirement to be on the trial is to get lab work each week that you don't get the treatment, at least between the first 4 treatments. The treatments are every 3 weeks, indefinitely. The side effects have been minimal, so far. I've had bouts of fatigue, some neuropathy, abdominal pain and light nausea, but all these symptoms should improve after the first 2 weeks. At worst, I might have the symptoms after the 2nd treatment, but I think (?) not after that one. The treatment center is phenomenal, just opened in October, and the people who work there could not be nicer. The doctor is attentive, professional and young (age 35), so I figure I'll retire before HE retires (ha-ha!). I could go on and on, but basically, it was a really great & better than expected experience. Ann",
