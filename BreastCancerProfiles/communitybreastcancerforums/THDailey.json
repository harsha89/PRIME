I have a metal taste in my mouth constantly, I have a really crazy rash (upper body) for the last 4 days and I am having swelling in my hands. I am pretty positive overall, I have moments of sadness or feeling sorry for myself but overall I try to manage it. I drink water all the time and I put lotion and organic oil on my face and body morning and night because the dryness is overwhelming. My hair is thinning but still hanging in there. I like to think after the first treatments I can manage the other ones better (hopefully) but I believe that eating and exercising is so critical for staying healthy. I love all the tips I am learning! Thank you!",

But I have been using organic shampoo and conditioner to help with the fullness and growth. I am 12 days out from first chemo round. I think I worry too much about my hair and eyelashes falling out. Overall my attitude is good but boy I don't like losing the hair, sure none of us do :) Stay strong and really learned a lot on this site.",

I drink water and then more water, drink your water and use your lotions and make sure you tell doctor when you have pain or any symptoms. I am on TC too so I get it my friend. I do every 3 weeks, but only have 1 more treatment left, thank goodness. It's hard but manageable. Keep your life as normal as you can, in my opinion :)",
