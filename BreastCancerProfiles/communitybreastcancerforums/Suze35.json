      "Content": "Jul 23, 2011 11:19AM - edited Jul 23, 2011 11:20AM by Suze35 There has been one (maybe two) studies done on diet and exercise - here is a link to a summary of the WINS study: http://www.cancer.gov/newscenter/pressreleases/2006/winsbreaststudy ER/PR+ women showed a 20% overall reduction in recurrence when they lowered their fat intake and upped exercise.  So if you have let's say a 20% chance of recurrence, diet and exercise can theoretically lower that to 16%.  The benefit is more obvious for triple negative breast cancers, with recurrence rates dropping by as much as 40+%.  More studies need to be done obviously. For the OP - do you have any other information about your cancer?  What is the proliferation rate (Ki-67)?  How big is the tumor actually?  I know it says 1cm in your stats, but is it closer to 2 cm?  Size also plays a role in possible recurrence.  How much of it was DCIS?  Did they identify lymphovascular invasion (different from positive lymph nodes).  It is Grade 3, and those cancers are at greater risk for metastisizing.  They also tend to respond better to chemo.  A bit of a quandry.  I would agree that age and overall health should also be taken into consideration. Would your doctors be willing to offer Taxol rather than Taxotere? It has a decreased incidence of neuropathy, although the chance is still there.  Taxol can be given weekly as well to deal with this. In the end, this is a decision you have to be comfortable with, as well as your family.  Do they have any opinions?  I hate it when doctors don't give you their clear opinions, it is frustrating. Good luck with your decision!",

I know Carbo dumped my numbers to the point of needing Neupogen shots the last five weeks, and I did weekly doses. Being Grade 2, it would make sense that you didn't respond as well to the chemo (slower growing tumor). Has your doctor computed your Residual Cancer Burden? It looks at things like residual cellularity, leftover DCIS vs. invasive components, and yes, remaining nodes. Many oncologists wouldn't recommend more chemo, because there are not many studies backing up its effectiveness. Those studies, however, are now starting. The good things you are ER+, which means AIs will help reduce your risk. I suggest a second opinion if you haven't had one yet, at a large cancer center or university if possible. Maybe see if there are any trials that suit you as well? It is a tough decision as to whether or not to go for more chemo. I was TN, so I chose to throw everything I could at it. I wish you the best in your decision.",

My stats at the bottom are a little misleading - I actually have TWO lumps (around 1\" each), four confirmed nodes (but my onc believes they are in the breast tissue and are not \"lumping\" together, hence Stage IIb), and we are 75% sure it is triple negative.  Still waiting on the FISH for the HER2neu, as it was initially HER2neu++. I am starting my chemotherapy on Thursday - 2 weeks from the day that I found my lump - and I think that is saving my sanity.  Push for quick treatment - but responsible treatment - if possible.  The thought that in just a few days I will actually be DOING something has given me purpose. I no longer break down at the sight of my kids, and my wonderful oncologist has given me hope that I'll live to see them grown with babies of their own.  Make sure you and your doctors are on the same page - even if it is just emotionally.  I could not handle a completely clinical doctor, I need someone to be a bit compassionate and reassuring. I have found that reading the threads here is very inspiring - these women are survivors, at any stage, and it helps me to keep my life in perspective.  I don't go much beyond that anymore.  I know what I have, roughly what stage, and what my treatment will be.  Now I just want to read about how these women have overcome everything I'm about to go through.  You will find strength in their stories too, I have no doubt. I wish you luck and good healh - this is treatable!  That was my BIGGEST fear - that someone would say \"sorry, too late to treat you.\"  Even now I'm a little afraid of my second opinion meeting tomorrow, lol.  But IT IS TREATABLE!!",

It is one of the few trials aimed at TNBC, and is opening up at all the major cancer centers. It is randomized 2:1, but if you have progression on just chemo,they switch you over. They are having some good results, so I'm hopeful, but realistic. I can always go to traditional chemos, but only have one shot at this trial, so it was worth the wait I hope!

I know there is a tacked thread at the top of the board for brain mets, you should be able to find lots of info and fellow women going through WBR real-time with you. I will keep you in my thoughts that WBR knocks this stuff out and you are able to move forward with few SEs. I mentally prepare myself for this dx every day, knowing it is the way of TN, but nothing truly prepares you for this news. Hang in there. Hugs and love. Susan",

I know you aren't as concerned about your surgeon, but I do think it is important.  If you have to have lymph nodes removed, or want skin sparing, etc., their skill is very important.  I chose Dr. Michelle Gadd at MGH because she is a breast surgeon with 20+ years of experience, and helped to pioneer the SNB.  I had a lot of nodes removed - two surgeries - and I credit her skill with my good surgical outcome - very little LE and an easy, quick recovery.  So while it is true you will be spending more time with your MO, be sure you are happy with your BS also. The MO at MGH offered me the same regimen as a more local doctor, so I chose my local doctor.  In the end, the local MO did quite a bit for me outside standard of care, and I'm not sure that would have happened at MGH. Dana Farber has a fantastic reputation, and so far has been good.  I had a lot of administrative snafus when starting the clinical trial, mess ups with appointments, tests that I needed, etc.  But as far as the MO is concerned, I am extremely happy with her.  She is young, very active in her research, and very well prepared.  Being Stage IV, I want someone on the top of their game, and I feel I have that.  Their infusion center is very nice, and everything is very central so parking is easy.  I can get my labs, eat at their cafeteria, and get my treatment, all in the same building. I would recommend you do a second/third opinion with each place.  You may find, like I did, that separating out your treatment is the best option.  I do think both factilities are top notch. Good luck!",

From my personal perspective - the \"traditional\" drugs are always there.  But there are many clinical trials right now that combine these with other agents, and being TN, I think that these extra agents offer us the best hope for better outcomes.  I am currently in a trial myself, and if/when this one fails, I will be looking for another one if possible.  Best wishes to your mother.  ETA - I find this VERY helpful here, as I am TN and am always looking for new clinical studies. Coolbreeze - this board states it is available for both patients and caregivers as a source of information and support.  I don't see how it is inappropriate for her to be posting here?",

If you are interested in other clinical trials for your mother, this is the one I am doing: http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01307891?term=death+receptor+5+uab&rank=1 It is strictly for TN, and has been showing some promise.  Abraxane can really be a work-horse, and the SEs aren't as bad as Taxol.  I am on the chemo-only arm for now, but when/if I progress, I will have the experimental agent added on. It might not be a bad idea for your mom to bring up the idea of other options to her doctor, because then he may provide her with a sound rationale.",

I've changed my diet quite a bit since diagnosis, and the one thing I've learned is that the best way to stick to those changes is to make sure you ENJOY them.  I don't think diet and supplements can cure cancer in any way, but I do think they can help improve your health which helps you deal with treatments and recovery better.  So have your mom keep the chocolate and occasional wine, but maybe make changes where she can. For example, I eat oatmeal every morning with blueberries and soymilk.  This is supposed to be very good for me, but I really enjoy it!  I've tried avoiding animal protein except fish, but it got boring fast, so I've added lean meats back in.  I've replaced any white flour products with wheat and whole grains, but I like them, so no big deal for me.  I love wine, but have switched to red.  So see what your mom is up to doing, and go from there! And I really recommend Dr. Servan-Schreiber's book - easy to read, doesn't promote EXTREME changes, and is very uplifting.  His dietary suggestions really make sense. Best to you both.",

It appears you've gone 5+ years since your initial dx, which is great - that shows you had a pretty good response to chemo the first time, and that usually indicates you will again. Hang in there, the waiting for treatment is the hardest part! I am currently doing a clinical trial of Abraxane and Tigatzumab (sp), which you might want to ask your doctor about - I don't know if it is working for me, but the early results are promising, and it is one of the few targeted drugs in trial for TN right now. There are also several trials with platins and taxanes. If you go the more traditional route, the chemos are more gently administered so QOL is maintained as best as possible. I really like www.tnbcfoundation.org, although it can initially be tough to read. However, the people there are amazing, and they tirelessly research new things for us.

I just received my preliminary diagnosis yesterday, and it has been so darn fast that I am still processing.  I am a 41 yo mother of 3 children, nine, six and three.  I have zero history of BC in my family - in fact no cancer at all!  I had a totally clear mammogram on April 20 2010.  The radiology doctor just kept repeating \"it was clear\" like he couldn't believe it.  This past Thursday, when I was showering I found a lump in my upper left breast, a few inches below my armpit.  My blood went cold.  I also felt some enlarged nodes. Yesterday AM I saw my GYN who immediately sent me for a sonogram.  The doctor then immediately did the biopsy.  I have two tumors next to each other, each about 2.5 cm.  He did a suction assisted cone on one, and a regular cone on the other.  He aspirated 4 nodes - which was actually one less than he had originally thought, so that was good.  I will have the path results Monday afternoon most likely. Due to the extremely rapid growth of this tumor, I am going forward believing this is HER2+, but have been reading up on EVERYTHING.  I also assume I will be at the very least Stage IIB, and more likely early Stage IIIA. I have a few questions that I know will be answered by doctors at some point, but I could really use some feedback if at all possible! 1) Given the extreme aggressiveness of these tumors, how quickly can I expect to start any sort of treatment? 2) It doesn't appear to be inflammatory or lobular - there are clear tumors, with clear edges.  Are there any other types of aggressive tumors that are not HER2+? 3) Does having two mediumish tumors change the staging in any way? 4) Do swollen glands always indicate involvement of that specific gland?  I.e. with 4 swollen glands, can I assume I am positive for 4 or could that go down? 5) Will I see a surgeon or oncologist first?  Or will that depend on surgery vs. chemo first? Needless to say I am gobsmacked.  This came completely out of left field.  I have had pretty strong premenstrual symptoms for the past 6-8 months, and I just can't help but feel that is related - surges of hormones making these suckers grow.  I am feeling very positive having read so many great outcomes here.  It has absolutely cheered me up.  I am generally a pragmatic, upbeat person, and this has served me well.  The doctor doing the biopsy commented several times on how calm I was, given how fast this has gone. I know I can only post 5 times a day, so I will return later to comment.  Thank you!

My MO is calling Dana Farber, as well as a few other contacts, for feedback on clinical trials. I am limited in that many of the trials use platins or taxanes, and I became resistant to those the first go-round. Is there a benefit to me putting off new treatment and risking spread for a visit to MDA? Can they offer me things I can't get at other top cancer centers?

I will be going through Dartmouth-Hitchcock in New Hampshire, but I live close enough to Boston if I am not comfortable with my care to go there.  I have heard excellent things about DH, and a friend of mine who is two years out from diagnosis had a fantastic experience.  Another aquaintance also did very well with DH.  I will be talking with their \"breast coordinator\" tomorrow AM and she will help me coordinate my care throughout this entire process.  I'll have my initial labs back tomorrow evening or Tuesday AM. I am heartened by how quickly my biopsy took place - the doctor wasn't playing around!  That bodes well I think for getting the ball moving downhill fast. I really appreciate the reassurances regarding the clear mammogram.  I have extremely dense breasts to the point that it was noted on my mammo \"which markedly limits mammographic sensitivity.\"  They never told me this at the time (just got the report Friday), nor did they \"emphasize the importance of self breast exams\" as they suggested.  Thank heavens I do them anyway! When the doctor performed the biopsy, he put a small chip in each tumor to mark them, and did another mammo to place them.  I plan on getting a copy of that film because I'm curious to see if the tumors are clearly defined.  Just curiousity I guess. Twinmom77 - I am thankful to hear your nodes were negative, even though enlarged.  I haven't found very much info on that other than enlarged = involved.  The doctor at first thought there were five, but dropped it to four, which he seemed pretty relieved to do.
