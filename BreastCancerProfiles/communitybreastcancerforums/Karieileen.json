I had to yell at some of my doctors, too.  They treated me like a pin cushion and stuck me with more needles than I can count;  I was in a \"learning hospital\" and the newbies were working on me until I refused to let anyone near me who hadn't been drawing blood for at least 5 years.  Your story is way worse than mine, but still...I like it when patients have the strength to pursue their needs instead of just listening to a doctor.  When you move on to radiation, be aware that it's no fun either.  It can make you sick, too.  Have you thought of trying any natural remedies?  Sometimes getting off of some of the pills really helps boost your mood and your health.  Look into peppermint or ginger for nausea if you still get sick and make sure to take care of your skin; radiation can reak havoc on it.  Try searching for relief bands or anti-nausea lozenges.  Try everything that helps.",
