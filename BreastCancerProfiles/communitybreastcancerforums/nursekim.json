I am finally done.  What started in June is now over.  Lumpectomy with axillary dissection, lumpectomy revision, port placement, taxotere and cytoxan every three weeks for six treatments, port removal, and thirty radiation treatments.  When I was diagnosed I came on here to read about other women that were survivors of this dreaded disease and found many. Thanks to you all for your support!  For all the \"newbies\"  good luck to you, and there is an end to this!  Other than a somewhat burnt breast and armpit I think I will survive.
