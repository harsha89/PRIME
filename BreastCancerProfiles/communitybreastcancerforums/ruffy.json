I was diagnosed at 37, no family hx, had my son at 23 and breast fed him for two years, I was very low risk for getting BC. And it doesn't seem like I'm alone, alot of young women with no risk factors seem to be getting diagnosed. :( I hope dr's realize this and continue to do cbe's. It just makes sense.",
