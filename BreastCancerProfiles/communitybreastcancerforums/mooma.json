I have all my reports...right from the beginning of this crazy journey.  That's excellent advice for everyone.",

I was diagnosed Nov. 10th.  I had a stereotactic biopsy on two areas of my left breast.  One diagnosed as invasive duct carcinoma and they found nothing on the other spot.  I had an MRI on the benign one and another mammogram, ultra sound and another biopsy.  They all came back neg. The first biopsy I had was after the MRI and the OR that did it missed the spot.  She then did it guided by ultrasound and got it but it came back benign.  The cancer wasn't detected until my OS did a biopsy during my lumpectomy on another cancer.  Very confusing and I don't want to scare you I just want everyone to take advantage of as much info as they can get so nothing goes amiss.  On the morning of my surgery, Christmas Eve morning, my surgeon (who was my second opinion surgeon I decided to go with...thank you Lord)  decided to take another piece of the second tumor....just for reassurance.  It turned out to be cancerous.  Now I will be having a mastectomy and recon.  You will be in my thoughts and prayers Friday! ",
