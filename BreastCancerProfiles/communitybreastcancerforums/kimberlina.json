Sickness is still going on - saw the nurse on my 12th session and she said that the sickness is because the radio is zapping the top of my stomach (I am quite short in height), and gave me anti-sickness pills.  The shortness of breath is because the radio is zapping top of my lung. It is now 5 days since I finished the radio - feeling sicker today - boob is full of blisters that are popping then bleeding. Havent walked the dogs today as I am short of breath. Is is just me - or is anyone else suffering ?  Everyone that I have spoked to have said that radio is a breeze - not for me it isn't.
