I would think as dtad said they won't do a mastectomy unless you are diagnosed with cancer or are at very high risk--some people who have the BRCA mutation will get a mastectomy even if they have not been diagnosed, but it doesn't sound like that is your situation. As for questions to ask, I would have them explain exactly why hey are doing it and ask if there are any other options.",
