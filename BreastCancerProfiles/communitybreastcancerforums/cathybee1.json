She wanted the Oncologist to weigh in on that. I found out yesterday that getting in to see an Oncologist is going to be as bureaucratic nightmare. Frustrating because all I want to get is a consult. My doctor also said insurance probably wouldn't approve genetic testing or an MRI given my diagnosis. I went into the appt thinking amother biopsy would be scheduled, but just as well because I have a huge hematoma from the core biopsy. I really don't like the fact that there's another cluster of microcalcs that no one had looked at. Read some of your posts in the LCIS group about the new findings. Did you have another excisional biopsy? And with your new locations, would they put you back on the anti hhormonal?",

The plan is to return in 6 months for a 3-D mammogram (which I haven't had up to now) and follow up with breast surgeon, then alternate every 6 months with a MRI. We discussed tamoxifen and AIs. For now, no chemoprevention. I agreed to revisit it if there are any changes after the next mammogram.",

I trust her and she has set up a weaning regime from the HRT that sounds humane. She did want me to talk about the HT and additional biopsy with someone else. Lots of strokes in my family, so worried my risk for having a life threatening SE from HT might be higher than average. An oncologist consult made sense to me plus my husband is seeing one for his myelodysplasia. He offered to give his appt to me just so I could talk to her, but it doesn't work that way. I have been doing some PubMed searches and there really is not much about ALH, let alone LCIS, is there?",

      "Content": "cathybee1 wrote: Started with a screening mammo in early October and got biopsy results yesterday. They biopsied only one of 2 areas with suspicious microcalcifications. The place they didn't was right next to my armpit. I was diagnosed with focal atypical lobular hyperplasia and columnar cell hyperplasia. It is a difficult report to understand but that was the diagnosis. 3 pathologists from the same practice had to sign off on it which was the reason they told me it took so long. A week ago, my GP called and prepared me that results were atypical so I did some reading. Yesterday, with the actual pathology report in hand, the women's health doc in the same practice as the GP wanted to start me on a course of Tamoxifen right away. I started weaning off HRT last week. I am 69 with 6 or 7 years of HRT under my belt after 3 years of menopause from hell. And have some endrometrial issues from the past. Zero cancer on either side of my family, but lots of strokes. And super active, a long distance backpacker. I was pretty adamant yesterday no Tamoxifen after reading posts on the Tamox thread here. Doc is referring me for a follow up with an oncologist for a consult but it sounds like that won't happen until January at the earliest. I requested a 2nd opinion pathology but doc yesterday said no need since they got 3 to agree already and also ordered a BRCA test just because. They ran the GAIL assessment on me, 4% chance of getting a malignancy in 5 years, that didn't sound so bad. Then today I ran the ISIS breast cancer assessment since I have Askenazi Jew heritage and that risk assessment came out 11% not even considering my dense breasts. I reconsidered the Tamox decision, then I read it knocks only 30% off the risk for my age and diagnosis. My head is spinning. Anyway it plays I'm still high risk. Words of wisdom from those farther along on this journey welcome. I will add I am very glad I have some time to think about it. Log in to post a reply",

A cancer center in the nearest big city is offering a stereotactic biopsy on Wednesday Nov 9. At first, I thought it would be better to have the last invasive procedure first. Then I talked to a surgical technician today about my concerns about a titanium marker. I am getting hardware removal the following day for an implant rejection to a surgical stainless steel plate and screws in my ankle following a fracture. You can imagine, given removal surgery the next day, I'm not up for having another bit of metal inserted in my body right now. The radiological tech today said not having the marker would limit subsquent surgical options if the biopsy was positive, saying that would foreclose lumpectomy/excisional biopsy. I am conflicted needless to say. I am really bothered by the no marker/mastectomy comment. Ideas welcome. Log in to post a reply",
