You say that you don\u2019t have an oncologist yet. You will feel much better and informed once you discuss your cancer with a oncologist. Having a plan to beat this is a very important part of dealing with it. What options have you been given? I had DCIS in my right breast and had it removed last year. I\u2019m just finishing with reconstructing the right breast and revisions to my natural left breast. It\u2019s been a long road but I\u2019ve stayed positive throughout everything and I know that it\u2019s helped me cope. It\u2019s also important to share your feelings with your husband and family. Let them be your strength",

You will meet with a doctor to discuss your pathology report. I know the waiting is hard, I had three biopsies a week apart before I learned of my diagnosis. Stay strong and best wishes for a clean report",
