I usually just say thank you. I cannot understand however why some feel the need to project their religious beliefs on another. That is such a personal issue.  Here is one that left me speechless--maybe you all can help me with a response. \"It is so sad that you will not be able to see your son grow into adulthood\".  Any thoughts on how to handle this one?",

I so get it BouncingBetties as in the last six months I have heard every comment I could ever think of and given every cancer diet and cancer cure book available(at least it feels that way). I found it so overwhelming altough I do realize everyone meant well. I am a positive person by nature but bc can sure knock it out of you at times. I also put on a front and try to spare others but the latest comment was the pits. \"You will be fine, you will live forever\"  Really?  My first post was about feeling lonely and down because no one truly understands until I found all of you.  I am very open about my cancer and I am trying to be very open about my emotional health even when it isnt good but it is so hard because everyone thinks you are not positive. BB I am hoping the Xeloda brings regression and better days. Hugs to you",
