I have a radial scar tumour which is being removed next week and then I have to wait another 2 weeks until I can hear for sure whether it is cancer or not. Big hugs to you, I can only imagine how you are feeling right now. xxxx ",

I am booked in to have it removed with a hook wire excisional biopsy for the same reason that flamom mentions. I can't wait to know for sure if this thing is benign or not! flamom how did you find the biopsy? How much time would you recommend taking off? I asked the lady from the hospital who called me to make the booking but she didn't know. Really hard as I am starting a new job on Monday and have to ask for time off for the surgery which is the week after! Such bad timing.",
