I found a sizeable lump this weekend in my left breast, to the left and above the areola area. No pain at all with it and it is somewhat mobile. I waited all day to see my doctor because she wouldn't just send me for the diagnostic u/s and mammo before seeing me and feeling it for herself. She told me my breasts are very dense...which I already knew and why I usually fight for an u/s in addition to the annual mammo...except this year I didn't fight for it. Found the lump right away and thinks it is probably a good sign that it is bigger (I don't know the exact size, maybe 2-3 cm) and more mobile (although I know this isn't always true). Radiology couldn't fit me in today so I have to go in tomorrow afternoon for the ultrasound and mammo...I know that I'm lucky that I don't have to wait a week or two but I'm still aggravated anyway to have waited all day to just see her and have her confirm what I already knew was there. Anyway...just needed to vent this. I'm not particularly nervous (at least I don't think I am!) as I know it's far more likely to be nothing than something. I was just hoping to get the test part done today as well. The fact that my doctor was on the phone trying to get me seen today and that they fit me in tomorrow is probably a little worrisome??? Wondering what other people felt when finding a lump. Log in to post a reply",

Part of that is because I just have a gut instinct that I will be at risk for BC at some point. I am currently 45 and I have extremely dense breast tissue. I have had annual mammo's since the age of 40 and a baseline at 36 (because of a maternal grandmother who passed away from BC at the age of 42 and a maternal cousin who was diagnosed in her late 40's). The past 2 years I have fought for and received full breast u/s but this year I just didn't feel like fighting. I did have my annual digital mammo yesterday and no phone call so that is good. However, I'm just wondering how secure I should feel given my situation. Do I push for a 3d mammo? Thanks! Log in to post a reply",

I'm never one to \"borrow trouble\" but knowing what I know about dense breasts, it seems like I am consistently more concerned than my doctors. I had to fight hard at my mammogram last year for the u/s (that they already had the order to do) to convince them I was well aware that it would change my mammo from a screening to diagnostic....and that I was more than willing to pay the copay! I just didn't feel like fighting it this year when they called to question me on it, again. meg2016 - as for the family risk, they don't seem to think it puts me at much of a risk since my mom and her sister are currently fine. And my sisters are also OK. Apparently, it's just enough to make ME nervous! I'll call my primary doctor and explain the issues I had with getting them to do the u/s this year....and ask if I should just go that route or something else (3D mammo or MRI).",
