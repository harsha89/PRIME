I can\u2019t worry about what may or may not happen in 10 years. I am living for today. Happy that my bc surgery is over. Looking forward to getting fitted for my prosthetic next week. I will worry about the future when it gets here.",

I had made up my mind from the beginning that I would not do chemo. Only hormone Therapy. My bc surgeon said from the get go that I would not need rads or chemo and I am leaning that way. I am 62. If I live another 7-10 years with no recurrence I am ok with that. Someone tell me that I am not crazy? Diag 4/17/2018. IDC stage 1a. Mastectomy 5/30/2018. Nodes negative ER+ PR+ HER2",
