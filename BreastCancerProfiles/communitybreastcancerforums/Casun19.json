Following along. I had bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction, however i ended up with an infection and the expanders had to be removed. After I finished chemo I was supposed to go back in to get it corrected but they found out I was stage iv and cancelled everything :( P.S. I would absolutely find another plastic surgeon that seems more interested!",

I think he is the one that is putting the hold on it because he wants more scans and doesn't want me to come off meds. Tigwin, thank you! I am in Northern California and have an amazing plastic surgeon who has always been ready to reconstruct. I think it's just a matter of getting all the docs to agree reconstruction is a priority. I started following along this thread was because I never considered the Diep flap before but since my body rejected implants the first time or I had that infection, I wanted to see what other stage iv gals have done. My plastic surgeon gave me a long list of things she could do. And this was one of them!",

I lost most my hair during AC and Taxol took the rest away.. (except the lashes and brows like I mentioned, which fell out later). I did dose dense treatment which was every other week 4 AC 4 taxol. Not sure if that has something to do with it? But So far it's the fluff and some dark patches on the back of my head but not the top... hoping it will fill in. Good luck on the rest of your treatments.",

      "Content": "Jun 21, 2017 08:52PM - edited Jun 21, 2017 10:21PM by Casun19 I love this post because when I see others posting about grandchildren my heart sinks. I have a 2.5 yr old and I know deep inside that I will never see grandchildren. My husband and I have been together for 10 years/ married 4 and we wanted more children. We had to \"grieve\" over the fact that this was not going to happen. This is a crazy thing to have to deal with, I also use Ativan to take the edge off. And if you are in any pain, make sure this is managed. Because that is the first thing that makes me snippy!! Check your local hospital. Sometimes there are support groups or programs you can request free through the hospital that is focused on children of parents dealing with cancer. So, either you can go talk to someone and get tips on how to discuss the topic with your child. Or your child can go sit with other children in a supportive setting. Lastly don't forget about yourself. We a very lucky and have tons of family help/ support. But over the last year my husband and I have just been on auto pilot to make sure our daughter is getting Everything she needs, Finding her a preschool, potty train etc. it's exhausting!! But we are now making a commitment to each other to have at least one date night a month. Find something fun and get your mind off the cancer",

Then I was diagnosed stage IV and cancer took priority. I had to wait for a few stable scans but, last month I had a Diep flap and so far I am very happy. I did have to take about a 1month break from treatment but it was throughly discussed with medical team. The prosthetics do help and you eventually stop thinking about not having breasts. But personally I absolutely hated it. I never felt comfortable in the prosthetics and swimforms. I just mentally couldn't get over it. I wish I was stronger but I was not. The benefits outweighed the risk of surgery for me. Good luck with your decision!!",
