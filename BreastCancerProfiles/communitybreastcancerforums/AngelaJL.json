It's not that I don't want treatment right away, it's just that the BS had been acting so nonchalant about it all up to that point that it really surprised me that the surgery needs to happen so soon. It makes me wonder if this is more serious than he had let on. In fact, after receiving my diagnosis of DCIS over the phone on Tuesday night and reading up on what DCIS is, I was very confused when he walked into my appointment on Wednesday afternoon and said, \"Now, you don't have cancer.\" I'm pretty sure the \"C\" in DCIS means \"carcinoma\". Was he just saying that because it's non-invasive",

After my every-2-year screening mammogram showed clusters of calcification on both sides on 8/1, I had biopsies on both sides on 8/9. I was just diagnosed on Tuesday (8/15) with DCIS on the right side (6mm) and a cluster of atypical cells on the left side (4mm). I was told they're estrogen and progesterone receptive. The BS says I need lumpectomies on both and radiation on just the right. I'll be meeting with the medical oncologist and radiation oncologist on 8/30. This has all happened so quickly In an appointment with the BS on 8/16, he said, \"There's no rush for the surgery.\" I asked him to define \"no rush\", thinking maybe some time in the next year since it's non-invasive. He said I'd need to have the surgery in the next 6-8 weeks. That seems very much like a rush to me! So I'm wondering how quickly DCIS progresses, how quickly people usually have surgery after diagnosis, how soon they begin radiation after surgery, and whether or not someone with DCIS usually has genetic testing done. Also, is radiation standard for DCIS? I'm so grateful for these forums and all of the shared experiences and wisdom.

I spoke with the radiation oncologist afterward, and he said they aren't going to be adding any extra sessions to make up for the 9 day pause, but I'll be having Saturday treatments this week and next. And - next week Saturday is my last treatment! Can't wait to be done. Since I'm face down for my sessions (like on a massage table), I don't get to see the machine moving around me. I kind of wish I could, since I'm very curious about how all of this works. Have a great weekend, all!",

My skin started getting pink after the 3rd treatment, and it started to itch a lot and break out after the 8th. I thought the itching and breakouts were my skin reacting to the cream (I have very sensitive skin), but when I saw my RO on Monday, he said that I actually have folliculitis as a result of the radiation. It's not a reaction to the cream. My RO said I could also use Radiagel or aloe if I wanted instead, but I'll stick to what I know. He also told me to add hydrocortisone cream into my rotation, between applications of the calendula cream, in order to stop me from scratching at the skin. So now I'm 13 treatments in, and my armpit, underboob, and the skin right around the areola are really pink and tender, and I have an itchy rash along my sternum. I'm not looking forward to how much worse it might get in the next two weeks. But at least I only have 8 treatments left!",

Regarding treating the skin before rads, my RO said to begin using the calendula cream maybe a week before I even began treatments, as he said it can also work preventatively. But yes, I have to wipe off any creams or deodorant immediately before each session. The treatment center where I go provides moist wipes called \"mammowipes\" in the changing room along with the dressing gowns, so I use those to clean the area. I've been wearing the Warner's \"Easy does it\" bra since beginning treatment. It's got no wire and no scratchy seams. Pretty much the whole thing is soft nylon, and it's pretty comfortable. Not terribly supportive, but oh well! Today, on a whim, I put on one of my normal, cotton, underwire bras from before all this, and I was unpleasantly surprised at how uncomfortable it was on my radiated skin. So I took it off and spent the rest of the day braless at home!",

The radiation team said they'll pay for my gas! I'm not sure how that works. Do I get to way overcharge them and then negotiate with them for a lower price? :D At this point, I'm concerned about what they'll need to do to make up for a week of missed treatments. Hopefully I'll get answers on Thursday.",

My skin is quite pink, though an area in the armpit is dark reddish brown and the skin around the outside of the areola is, too. My RO said today that he gives it a 50-50 chance of the skin breaking down, which he calls desquamation. So he prescribed me some silvadene antibacterial ointment to use instead of Calendula cream, if it does break down. Has anyone else used that ointment? Anyone dealing with open sores? Also, how about fatigue? It suddenly hit me mid-week last week, and it\u2019s seems I can\u2019t get *not* tired no matter how much sleep I get!",

I'd mentioned earlier that my center's radiation machine broke down last Friday, so my last treatment was Wednesday the 22nd. Starting today I was going to be driving to a different city for treatment at the sister facility. Well, today I got to the other city and found out that their machine had broken down, too! (Granted, they called me in time to save me the drive, but I'd driven over early, so that was my fault.) So this means I'm currently 5 full treatments behind schedule. Fortunately, my local center's machine is supposed to be working again tomorrow, so I'll go for my 14th treatment (out of 21) tomorrow. They'll be giving me a new schedule with all of the make-up sessions, including the weekends. I am very ready for this to be done! The daily frustration of not knowing whether I'll have my treatment - or where - was really getting to me yesterday.",
