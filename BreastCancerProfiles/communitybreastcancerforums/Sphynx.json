The first picture is 4 months growth, thick and curly. I ditched the wig at 2 months out. The second is about 9 months and I didn't know what to do with those curls and bangs. Tried being a blond. The third is 2 years and it is still thick, long and curly but less so. Loved that year. The last is current - back to natural color, very thin and fine and exactly like it was before chemo - sigh! I used nioxin shampoo back then. Editted since I noticed that the third picture was taken at a bc.org get-together in 2/2005. (not 2006) ",

My lashes and brows fell out late and came back quickly. Unfortunately, the lashes fell out a few more times way after chemo. Everything is back to normal now. I know it's frustrating but, I haven't heard of anyone not growing their hair back after chemo. Some just grow really slow. I don't think I did anything special to make it grow fast. I shaved my head when it was falling out. When the baby downy hair grew in, I shaved that off also. It is wonderfully soft but didn't feel like real hair. It's some kind of tease of nature. That was the only time I've ever had thick hair. Now it's very thin. Don't forget to take advantage of the 'Look Good, Feel Better' program for your area. Tons of free makeup! http://www.lookgoodfeelbetter.org/women/program_finder/ Jane - I'm not sure but I'm sure someone else will know. Nancy",

When my hair grew back, I look like a monkey with so much arm hair.  I still have the face fuzz that I think you can see in the first picture.  I could do without that. Whether it grows slow or fast, it does come back! ",

I put pictures back on page 60.  Six years out, my hair is exactly like it was before, THIN!  It was nice while it lasted.   Don't get discouraged you guys.  It just takes time and the best part is we are around to talk about it.",
