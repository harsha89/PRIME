I wasn't sure if this thread was still actively monitored after so many pages :-) She's not taking any hormonal stuff right now; although I believe she did in september/october, but I don't want to be quoted on that. She will be starting low doses of \"effexor\"(sp?) because her OBGYN said that can help with hormones as it seems like the Chemo treatments put her in post menopause symptoms and is now experiencing hotflashes. The thought of \"cancerw that doesn't mean that's what my wife is experiencing, it does fit along those lines. Is it a chronic condition? is back...\" is definitely a huge concern for us, and I really agree with your sentiment, Peregrine. Thank you for your bursitis comment, while I kno Thanks again you two!",

She has gone through all the treatments, like: chemo, herceptin because she's Her2 positive (I think is why she is on it?) and perjeta while she was doing chemo. She had a double mastectomy done on June 8th and had a decent recovery. In early October, her right side pelvis bone area really started hurting. She describes it as if it's a bruise, and when she moves in certain twists/turns, that it feels like someone is kicking her on the bruise. When this started happening is when she was working outside a lot, but she stopped for a few days which made the pain lessen, but never really went away per her description, There are days where it's fine, days where it's not fine. More often than not, she mentions it bothering her (she's a pretty strong fighter, so it takes a good amount of pain for her to say something like that.) The thought in both of our minds is: Did the cancer already spread to other areas in her body? The pet scan she had earlier in 2017 showed that it was in 7 or 9 (don't remember which for sure) of her underarm lymphnodes (left breast.) The other scans and blood tests that have been performed haven't shown a tumor marker increase. There's another Pet scan coming up at the end of the month, but the anxiety is killing us. Based on what I described, does it sound like her cancer did spread to other origins of her body? like we got it too late? I know everyone knows what I want to hear, but I wouldn't mind hearing an objective opinion favoring one side or another.. She has no other \"stage 4 symptoms\" that I've read, \"just\" this pain near her pelvic area.  thank you for any insight",
