I last posted here about 2.5 years ago when I found a long, flat spot (nearly three inches in diameter - I have HUGE breasts) on the bottom of my breast. After four months of inconclusive mammograms and ultrasounds and a lot of \"we know something's going on here but we don't know what\", I finally had a bilateral MRI. My breast surgeon called me to tell me that she saw no evidence of cancer and believed the flattening was caused by fibrocystic breast tissue. She told me to follow up three months later if the spot was still there, but three months later I was sitting at my father's deathbed and for a long time afterwards, the flat spot on my breast never crossed my mind. After talking with a friend who encouraged me to go in for a follow up exam (even 2.5 years later and now living on the other side of the country from my surgeon), I examined my breast again. The flat spot only appears when my arm is lifted - but now it is more indented than flat and there's a deep dimple (about a centimeter in diameter) immediately next to it. I'm relatively new in my state and didn't yet have an OBGYN. After getting a referral from a friend for a trusted one, I found out that she can't see me until May 31st, so her nurse practitioner suggested that I ask my breast surgeon (again, 2.5 years later and on the other side of the country) if she would write me a script for a diagnostic mammo/us in the meantime. And because my surgeon is an absolute rockstar, she agreed! My mammo/us are scheduled for this coming Thursday morning at the local breast center. I can't seem to stop myself from doing as much research as I possibly can about whether or not fibrocystic breast disease can cause such dimpling. Everything I've read makes it seem like if it was FBD, the dimpling would have resolved by now, and that the vast majority of dimpling is because of breast cancer. I know that MRIs can be fallible, so there's a small chance that the radiologist may not have caught something that has continued to grow in my breast in my extremely dense breasts. Or that there's something new there causing the new dimple. I'm trying (and failing) not to be afraid of what may be lurking inside my breast. And to round out my fears, I'm a pastor who just had a congregant (who has been going on her own adventure with breast cancer testing) call me to tell me she's been diagnosed with cancer. Her meeting with her surgeon is at the same time as my diagnostic mammo/us. I know that's not a sign of anything - we are two very different people with two very different (and different aged! She's in her late 60s and I'm 31) breasts. But it still feels spooky to me. Oh ladies, stuff like this proves to me that I'm not as fearless as I think I am... Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "LoveTheWatcher wrote: Hello, all. This past Saturday I was mopily examining my droopy (and large) breasts in the mirror and was trying to make them appear more \"lifted\" when I noticed that the right breast was no longer a perfect half-moon shape like the left. I couldn't feel a definite lump in them, but the obvious change in shape scared me and I immediately made an appointment for a breast exam. Several years ago, when I was in undergrad (maybe 5 years ago now?) I asked my GP about the multiple lumps I felt in my breasts, and he did and exam and told me that my breasts were just naturally lumpy and to not be terribly concerned. So I decided not to be, and though I would notice lumps from time to time, assumed they were part of my natural biology and didn't have them checked out, especially as they were present in both breasts and were always moveable. Probably a stupid move on my part, but when I get scared about my health I latch on to the most benign possibility and go with it. But this time, I got really scared about the misshape in my breast and I had my appointment on Monday. He did a breast exam and said that while he couldn't identify masses, exactly, there was something disconcerting inside of my breast and he could see the same misshaping that I could. He did identify what he called \"thickening\" that was concerning, and decided to send me for a diagnostic mammogram, which I am having tomorrow afternoon. He said we would figure out what was going on inside my breast and that he would have a surgeon look at the mammogram and ultrasound results to determine the next point of action. He said he saw no outward signs of something like IBC, as my skin had no changes and I had no issues with the nipple other than the occasional itch. He also told me that my age was on my side in this matter, though he knew I had been an oncology chaplain (I am an ordained Presbyterian minister now - in fact, I just moved to Florida two months ago and am working in my very first church) and so we both knew that being young doesn't mean I don't have cancer. He told me he was hopeful that this mammogram would be the last one I'd have to have before I turned 40, but that he had concerns and wanted my tests to happen as quickly as possible. The thing is... I can't stop thinking about what could be wrong, and kicking myself for not having the other lumps checked out. I'm completely alone in this new state and all my friends and family live on the West Coast and in a line of work where I am supposed to be the emotional and spiritual support for others - in fact, I was counseling a man who has recently lost his wife to breast cancer the morning before I had my exam on Monday. I am hyper aware of my breast, and now it feels constantly painful, which I think is probably psychosomatic. I am a little bruised in places after he palpated my breast, which seems a little weird because he didn't press hard. I am trying not to go down the road of \"what ifs\" but I've got the \"burden of knowledge\" from my prior work in oncology and can't help but convince myself that I'm about to journey down this road, too. But I am so very afraid, and I feel so very alone. Log in to post a reply",
