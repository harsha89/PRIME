I love that... and totally agree. I'm going to be provocative here and say cancer is the best thing that ever happened to me. Never have I had the chance to get off the life train. To stop. Look around and find out what's not working. We each have the potential to create our own reality and that is no less true than here. Cancer is not a single well-trodden route. It's your route. What you have seen on the telly or heard in the media is not the only way. I'm sorry you will be challenged in new ways but also... Yeay! You'll be challenged in new ways! An opportunity for you to cocoon and emerge a butterfly. For relationships to improve, life-balance to shift and how you feel about you to sky rocket. I send you my best healing vibes for your convalescence. Love yourself, nurture you, relax as much as possible. That's when the body heals itself... And work through your fears to see what is actually happening / how you're feeling in your body. That's my best advice chicken. Make it yours xx",
