I know my situation is a little different in that I never had drains ( think this was a big mistake) but wondering if anyone out here is dealing with seromas? I am at week 6 post op tomorrow and keep getting radiation postponed because my seroma is too big. I have it drained 6 times over 3000 ccs so far and frustrated !! I am wondering if anyone has been fiven tips or tricks to help get rid of them :) Hope everyone is well and other then this annoyance I can say I am finally feeling normal ( well the new normal) since surgery !! Update - Just got a call going in to get drains in until radiation is over... frustrating to say the least !!",

Stay strong ladies and for those entering Chemo , stay strong and advocate for yourselves, it is temporary and you will get through but use the boards to ask questions and vent, lean on people and accept offers to help, there will be ups and downs for sure but in the end you will all kick cancers ass !",
