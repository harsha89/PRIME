Anyone have insight into how much pain I should feel afterward and for how long? Will I be going braless for a few days? Thank you!",

I was able to speak to the doctor at 8 a.m. this morning (so grateful that she was already in the office and at the same location today). Bad news is that the MRI confirmed that there is something there, so now I need to go the MRI biopsy route (I don't know all the terminology yet). The good news is I'm geting this dealt with. As I've read time and again on here it's the unknown and waiting that will undo you! Having concrete information and a next step is helpful. They couldn't schedule me until 10 days from now. Of course I hate the thought of waiting but so grateful to have a plan. Doctor says in a nutshell that we're likely looking at radial scarring or a cancer. Can anyone point me to data that tells me how often this sort of thing is benign v. cancer? Guess that's pointless because this is ME, no a study, but I'd like to know what the liklihood is based on stats.",
