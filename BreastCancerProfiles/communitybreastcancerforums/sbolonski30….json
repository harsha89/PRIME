I know before i went i came to this site and read and read and I found it extremely helpful so i am just trying to tell you as much as i can to help ease your mind. Tonite, my boob is a little soar but im making dinner, dancing around the house and cleaning, i will probably clean until friday when i get the results. My mom was diagnosed with breast cancer 2 yrs ago and to look at her now, no one would ever know she is more radiant and more beautiful then ever. I wish you luck. Stacy",
