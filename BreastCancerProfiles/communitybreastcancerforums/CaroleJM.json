I am fairly positive that if I had any choice in the matter, I would have picked Door Number 2 and had poison ivy instead of MBC. That's what irks me to no end. We all know that attitude is important to our quality and enjoyment of life but that has NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FACTS. We are living with a disease that is going to take our life. Today, tomorrow, next year, next 5 years but it is going to win. Being Merry Sunshine Tossing Rose Petals might be good for a laugh, but it doesn't change the facts. Knowing that isn't having  a \"bad\" attitude. It's reality. I try to stay upbeat and engaged most of the time, for my mental health and the sake of my loved ones but damn! Am I allowed to have a bad day without some ignorant  twit throwing it up in my face? See? Now I am in a bad mood. Gosh. I guess this means that it will be \"my fault\" when I die from metastatic breast cancer.",
