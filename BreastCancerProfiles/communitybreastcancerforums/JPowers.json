I was diagnosed in 2009 and never had a problem with this. On a recent flight, I was wearing my compression sleeve and I noticed it was really annoying me. By the end of the flight I couldn't wait to get it off! Since then I have started noticing the aforementioned symptoms but thought they were related to my high blood pressure so, knowing that women present differently than men, I became concerned that I was maybe having heart problems. After a visit to an ER, and a myriad of tests that determined my arteries were fine, it was determined that I did need a new blood pressure medication but that my arm pain was unrelated. So, here I am reading this and wishing I had considered this first because you all describe similar feelings to what I'm experiencing! Thank you all for your posts",
