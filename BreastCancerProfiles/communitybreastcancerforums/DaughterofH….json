The surgen last week was able to pick up her tumor by pupils being different and that was before official diagnoses! I hug her all the time and I have 5 kids ages 2,3,4,6 and 9 who I take over every day to give her something to work towards as they are her only grand kids! Will be back on later Thankyou again it's good to know I'm not alone ;)",
