He told me I have nodular gynecomastia. He said the lump I am feeling is just a more prominent section of my gyno. He showed me on both testing screens where I have the same tissue around both of my nipples but I can only feel where it is more severe. He told me if my anxiety does not go away he will biopsy but he does not feel it is necessary, but if I insist he will be glad to schedule it to put my mind at ease. For now he wants me to make an appointment with a breast specialist to do blood test and monitor my situation. My only question now is how often is breast cancer in my age group misdiagnosed even with the test I had today. Either or my mind is surely more at ease than it was when I woke up this morning. Thanks to all for following my case and giving positive thoughts. Hopefully the test today are correct and I am fine, but this scare has also influenced me to spread the word of early testing of male and female breast cancer:)",
