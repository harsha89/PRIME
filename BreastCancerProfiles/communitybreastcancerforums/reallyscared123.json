    "Content": "reallyscared123 wrote: I am absolutely terrified. I noticed a horizontal dent in my left boob. I've had this before, ten years ago, after I had lost weight, and had a mammography. All was fine. Its come back now, again after losing weight, but I am still very worried and awaiting a mammography. The dent looks like I have pushed my finger into my breast, just as the breast starts to increase in size and the skin is very thin - in fact it is sitting in between two ribs. Because of weight loss and probably the menopause (it's now been one year since my last period and I'm 52) my boobs have got smaller and my ribs are very pronounced when I raise my arms. However, when I do this, the dent seems to stretch and appear longer. The skin in the same place on the other boob feels thin too. I have no lumps. The doctor has referred me for a mammogram which when I rang the surgery today has been marked urgent and to be done within two weeks. Without losing it completely, I understand this is normal procedure for anything that is array with a breast problem. Any reassurance/guidance/experience sharing would be appreciated so much.
