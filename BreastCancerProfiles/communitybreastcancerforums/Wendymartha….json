A question for you post-surgery gals...did anyone have a spinal block in addition to general anesthesia?  My girlfriend had this and it scares the living daylights out of me.  My next step is to cut off my 10 inches of long hair knowing that chemo is coming - but I have decided to donate it...it somehow makes this aspect of cancer bearable.
