I have finally got my treatment plan, I start this coming Friday with chemo (FEC-T) 6 rounds, ne day every 3 weeks.  After chemo I will do 4-5 weeks of radiation and hormone therapy.  They are throwing everything at me to make sure they get any straggler cells that made it through the lymph nodes.  They said my sugery was successful and there was a clean margin (so that's good) but they can't be 100% sure stragglers didn't get through.  I am nervous but also anxious to get this over with.   Thanks for your concern.",

I feel too young to have this, especially when there is no family history but I'm trying not to dwell on that.  I noticed that you had your treatments before the surgery, one of my local friends had the same.  Do you know if there is a reason for this?  I've had all my surgeries first and then I'll have treatment, most people I've spoken with had the surgeries first and then the treatment and I was just wondering if have the treatment first was new and more effective.  4-wheeling 86 miles sounds so great we love to 4-wheel and I think that sounds amazing.  I think the first thing I would like to do after all my treatment is go away on a honeymoon with my husband and children, we never had one because we both had started new jobs when we got married.  Thanks for your reply and your prayers, I appreciate all the thoughts and prayers I receive and mine go out to you also. Take care and you are right, it is only temporary.  Angie",

I really appreciate all the replies.  I think we all share such a strong bond.  Take care and goodluck with you liver biopsy, I will be thinking of you. Angie",

I completely understand how you felt, I made the decision before I even had the results of the partial that if it came back I had to have a mastectomy I would have both removed.  It was a shocking sight at first but I'm getting used to it and am so happy I made the decision I did.  I bet it does making riding the 4-wheeler more comfortable :).   Have a great day too, and love and prayer to you!
