I go to the surgeon on Tuesday to get the results and schedule for surgery... Breast is painful and has been for over a year..trying not to worry but it is so hard I forgot to add, since the first time, I started running lost 15 lbs, ran my 1st 5k which just happened to be a breas cancer race, and went to an primary care, now having to go back for more blood work because my platelets are elevated, could just be because of exercise or cancer, so says Google.

No biggy..before the surgery the surgeon told me he was very concerned because of the tail thingy. He took many samples and right at the end of it the round part of the mass collapsed.. He said he feels that is a good thing. But then did say it had blood in it. I keep reading that blood is bad. Now the waiting game again until Tuesday afternoon.",

      "Content": "Alemap118 wrote: my journey started May 6th when I had my annual mammogram  which was actually two months late. I got a call back and had an ultrasound and specific spot mammogram. I got the results last Tuseday and it states 4c highly suspicious for malignancy. I scheduled my mammogram because my right breast felt funny. It would tingle and burn in the area that I now find out is a mass. And my armpit (nodes)??? Would hurt. My breast would hurt. Only on that side. So that is what prompted me to get my annual done. Everything I keep reading says BC doesn't cause pain or any symptoms. But I defiantly feel something weird. I can't feel the lump. The dr didn't feel it either. I also just found out that I have very dense breast. Why didn't they tell me over the last 3 years of getting mamos? I am 49 and I am terrified. I am having heart palatine, feel like I can't breathe and headaches. I feel like I am in a fog. I can't concentrate. Tomorrow I go to the surgeon to go over the results of the us and mammogram.. And then I guess they will do a biopsy? I have had cysts 20 years ago but this is defiantly different. Sorry for the rambling, but this is how my grain is working, like switching channels I am all over the place.  Log in to post a reply",

After the Mammogram they said the radiologist didn't fell I needed the us because everything looked fine. I had a gut feeling I should have done it. I have very dense breast. No for the best month I have intense itching and burning pain in my right breast right under the nipple. I have now a small red marklike 2 inches from the nipple. At first it felt like stitched were popping though the skin. My mast biopsy was in April.My armpit is aching and occasional pain into my arm. I feel some hardness under the nipple that just does not feel right. But not really lump per se. I'm calling the surgeon tomorrow, but how do I get him to take me seriously? It feels like someone is taking a blow torch to my breast. But no redness. Log in to post a reply",

Sorta looks like a sperm..he said if it was coming from the nipple out he would not be concerned at all and believe it is just a papiloma..but the \"tail\" thingy is going the opposite way..but no worries...I'm going to take the advice of others and just breathe..what will be will be.",
