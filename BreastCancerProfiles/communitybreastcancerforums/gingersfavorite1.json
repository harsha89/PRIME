I've hear you say hair loss usually happens  (starts?)  around days 14-17.    I'm assuming you mean two weeks after first chemo, right?     Does it make a difference what your cocktail is?     Those of you that have lost yours,  do you use any special lotion to keep it feeling and looking good?    (The easier to get / less expensive the better of course  :)  I've also read to suck on hard candy during treatment.   I had a popcicle during round one, but will chose ice chips as I get the mighty red injection this time.     Any particular reason for hard candies also? Hmm....  those are the only questions I can think of at the moment, although I'm sure I'll come up w/more later.    Anyone else, feel free to chime in w/questions of your own.     And thanks to those of you who've gone before us, for sharing your insight & experience!

The issue now is .... that I've had abnormal pap's for more than a year  (maybe 2?)     Was told not to worry, they take care of it by way of cryotherapy and a colposcopy.     Both of which I had last year and apparently didn't work ..... since my most recent pap still came back suspicious.    I was called in to see the ob/gyn this week.    My friends and I (always looking on the bright side)  thought  \"well,  if it's pre-cancerous,  at least you are treating it  (by way of chemo)  already!\" Umm.....  no  :( The doctor explained to me that this is viral in nature.    Caused by HPV,  which I may have been exposed to 3 years ago or 30 years ago, doesn't matter.     She went on to say that the chemo will actually be hindering my ability to fight it off, as it's compromising my white and red blood cell counts.     So while a strong, healthy body might be able to fend off this viral attack for awhile,   mine cannot.     She suggested another colposcopy and if that comes back suspicious, then a LEEP procedure.    If that is still abnormal,  then it may be time to take my cervix.   I'm thinking why go through two more  (somewhat painful)   procedures - just take the dang thing!     My second concern was if I'm not so much as to get a scratch or a cut at this time ..... how safe would it be to have these procedures done?    She feels that the risk of not treating it now, far outweighs the risk of doing it.    She was going to call and consult with my oncologist about this.    I have great respect for him!    He also happens to be married to an ob/gyn,  so I feel he may have a little more insight to women's issues than some might. I will see him before my next chemo this Wednesday,  so I'm anxious to get his take on the whole thing. I guess I'm posting for feedback and insight.   If any of you have experience w/this I'd love to hear from you.    Otherwise just well-wishes and prayers would be much appreciated!  Stephanie ~ Log in to post a reply",
