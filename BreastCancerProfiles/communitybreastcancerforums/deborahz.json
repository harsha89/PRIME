I'm not a candidate for DIEP, and I don't like the idea of moving any muscles, so I'm looking into having hip flaps or SGAP at NOLA, but Ihave so many questions.  I have tried to find answers to my questions by searching through previous posts, but I would love to talk to someone who has been through a similar situation- reconstruction with silicone implants that have failed and then had a bilateral reconstruction with hip or SGap flaps, preferrably at NOLA.  Some of my questions are: 1.  How do you sleep if your backside and front side are both healing? For how long is sleeping difficult? 2.  I'm concerned about having a flat, odd looking butt- How bad is it?  I don't want to fix my boobs just to have my rear look awful.  I have seen some of the photo gallery pictures on NOLA's site, but none are from the side so I can't tell if they look OK. 3. How do Hip flap boobs feel?  My implant ones are pretty firm and have no movement.  Are the reconstructed ones from flaps soft enough for husbands to enjoy? If any of you would be willing to talk with me, please email or PM me.  I appreciate the help!
