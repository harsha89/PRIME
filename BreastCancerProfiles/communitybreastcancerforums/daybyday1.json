Speedy recovery to all.......",

I'm getting alot more nervous as the days go by.  The advice you ladies have been giving is great and hopefully I will get through this without a hitch!  My surgeon said I would probably be in the hospital for 1 or 2 days - I'm hoping overnite only.  I'm supposed to be at the hospital at 10:30 am so not sure exactly what time my surgery is scheduled for. The only good thing out of this is that this particular hospital has all private rooms YEAH!!!! Best wishes and speedy recoveries to all who have had surgery and those having surgery today and the rest of this month. Ev",

This is a recurrence for me. I was diagnosed May 2007 and had Lumpectomy 7/5/07 (IDC 3cm Gr3 Stage IIb/III 1/3 nodes er/pr - her2+).  I had AC x4 every 21 days, then Taxol x4 every 21 days, then Herceptin every 21 days for 1yr. I completed my year of Herceptin 11/08.  I felt a lump under my left arm a couple of weeks prior to my LAST Herceptin treatment and ct of chest, biopsy and pet scan confirmed metastatic left axillary lymph nodes and recurrent left breast cancer. No evidence of distant sites thankfully.  Wishing all a speedy recovery!",
