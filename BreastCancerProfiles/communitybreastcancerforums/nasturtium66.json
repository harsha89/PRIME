I had my first ultrasound June 10th after an annual exam where my nurse practitioner was a little concerned about how lumpy and bumpy my breasts were. Over a month goes by before I get my results. I had figured everything had turned out ok since I hadn't heard anything back. But no, results just took FOREVER or they got lost or something. The results were that I had 3 masses in each breast. The ultrasound was labelled as technically difficult and I was recommended follow up with an MRI. So I then have to wait a little more than a month for an appointment with the breast surgeon. August 18th. August 18th I meet with the BS. He almost dismisses me with just having fibrocystic breasts, this is until I ask him a bunch of questions, and asked him why they had recommended an MRI. He then pulls out the report from the old MRI and actually READS it...then he decides to do an ultrasound on me right then and there. Ultrasound was done..the technician seems to see all cysts except one possible clustered area with calcifications. All the while the doctors and tech are commenting on how dense and cystic my breasts are, and how the ultrasound is even tricky to see anything.  So with seeing the clustery area, the BS orders me a diagnostic mammo. I'm not sure why we didn't go straight to biopsy considering how dense my breasts seemed. But probably since I have never had a mammo before they wanted to at least get that in as a baseline or something to that affect. I wait 2 1/2 weeks for the diagnostic mammo. I arrive to the appointment only to be turned away because they didn't have my past ultrasound images. The BS office had screwed up and had miscommunication with radiology....so because of this I had to make a new appointment. Now it's another 2 1/2 week wait! Finally I go in for the diagnostic mammo on September 17th. As I guessed, my mammo was so unreadable. It was labelled as a BRI RADS 0 and the radiologist recommended I go to her for ANOTHER ultrasound. So after waiting a fews days trying to get a hold of my BS, the decision he makes is that I should come in for another breast exam with him, then if he thinks it' necessary we will do a fine needle aspiration right then and there.  This appointment is now in about 2 more weeks. October 6th.  So what I'm saying is....June 10th to October 6th. I'm going a little crazy over here!  And now all I do is try to do a breast exam everyday to feel all of my different bumps and try to figure out which one is the one of concern. I ignored my breasts for years because of all of the sensitive lumps..now I'm nervous there is something there or hidden. And I'm mostly concerned that since I don't have any clear imaging yet that something could be hidden that we don't even know about. I also definitely admit too obsessively looking at my first ultrasound's images of the masses and comparing them to different ones online. Not healthy I know...but it's hard with all of this waiting!
