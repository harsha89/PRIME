I drove myself CRAZY with Google and then stumbled upon these boards. I was convinced and preparing myself for a diagnosis of at least DCIS. I am too thin for needle biopsy, so had to have a location wire placement followed by an excisional biopsy. Actually turned out to be a lumpectomy. The procedure for the guide wire was not nearly as bad as I imagined it would be. I had the surgery done and my mind was a whirlwind as they were talking about clear margins etc.. I swore that, no matter what my results turned out to be, I would come back to this board to share my personal experience. The lumpectomy was not bad at all. I was out of the hospital within an hour after the surgery. I needed no pain meds at all. Waiting, Now THAT was the most terrifying part. I am happy to say that 3 days after my surgery I got the GREAT news that my results were benign. THANK GOD! I have very small breasts and cannot see any difference between the two other than the 1 and a half inch scar which I've been assured will become very faint with time. I can live with that knowing what the alternative could have been. God bless all of you who are going through diagnosis or treatment. I just wanted to provide some hope for all of you who are playing the 'waiting game'. Be well! Log in to post a reply",

I've heard many explanations, as well as some anger about the two terms being used interchangeably. What I was told was that an excisional biopsy would remove some tissue for 'diagnosis', while lumpectomy would remove the entire 'questionable' area with a POSSIBLE 2nd surgery if they did not achieve clear margins. I guess Doctors are different and it is a good reason to ask LOTS of questions! Again, the purpose of my post is to let ladies know that these microcalcifications can and do come back benign! My best to all.",
