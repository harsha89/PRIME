What you're describing sounds like \"cording\" to me.  Renee gave a detailed explanation of this on 12/22 and it sounds like this is what you're experiencing--here's what she posted: # Cording occurs as a result of the lymph glands and lymph channels being removed from your axilla region or armpit # Cording often shows itself as a palpable tight and painful band of tissue (like a cord - hence the name) running down the arm towards the hand # Cording can be felt at any part of the arm (Marjory had pain and tightness down the back of her arm but I've heard of other women who feel it in the forearm or around the elbow) # Cording is a kind of soft tissue tightness usually seen in the axilla. It can extend from the mastectomy or lumpectomy or even the drain scar down the arm to the wrist. It is painful and can sometimes recur. The pain of cording can settle in a few weeks or can last for months # Some physical therapists say that the cords can be stretched or massaged and that this can lead to an immediate improvement in range of motion and a decrease in pain. Some women say that massage is too painful to tolerate # Cording is probably due to changes in the arm's lymph vessels and can appear six to eight weeks following surgery or even months afterwards. Many surgeons don't tell women about this, like they don't tell you about lymphdema or about the need to do exercises for the arm on the affected side.  Hope this is helpful!",
