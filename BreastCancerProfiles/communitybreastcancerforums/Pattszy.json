Would like to ask anyone here what are the challenges that you have experienced after surgery? I'm a week of finishing my 2nd trimester for my MBA program. As of now I'm currently at home and still can't go to school, and office. My surgeon is offerring me breast pads because i do not want to do a tram flap and reconstruction. My supportive husband told me not to be conscious without having breasts because its not obvious. I'm worried to how can i cope and bring back my normal life after surgery. I read forums regarding breast cancer and my mom just died because of leukemia but not breast cancer, after she fought breast ca after 25 years she was diagnosed with mds and later on progressed to aml. im so scared on the future on what hold for me. any encouraging message?
