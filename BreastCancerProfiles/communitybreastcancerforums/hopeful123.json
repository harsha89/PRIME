So the fact that you have micromets doesnt necessarily mean you didnt respond to treatment. You still have radiation and Tamoxifen to keep things in check. You are luminal A it appears, and this has one of the best prognosis. I know of two people who are close friends one Stage IIIb and another Stage IIIc who had a similar pathology to yours at diagnosis and are  5 and 8 years out. Keeping you in my thoughts and prayers. ",

While it could just be my harmonal mood swings (I am 45),I think a large part of it had to do with just connecting with this forum of people who have been through or are going through what I am going through. I feel ready to face whatever the results bring on. As cycle-path put it, I am not on the Titanic (cycle-path -I am afraid I like the Titanic better )",

They found a 3 cm mass along with two other smaller masses at the same site as the calcifications. The radiologist and doctor said it looks very suspicious didnt give me a score. She did look at all the surrounding lymph nodes and said they looked good (didnt know you could say much about lymph nodes involvement with US). My PCP called and said it was a 50-50 chance that it was cancer (again not sure how she came up with this number). Now waiting for biopsy to be done Jan 24th. This wait is killing me. I am a type A person that stresses out about every little thing in life. I am so glad I found this forum and can vent without feeling guilty. Thanks for listening to me.
