I have just found I have a lung nodule, and a visit again via the livertumor conference. The tumor disrupted fluid in my abdomen during opex. Right now, I faxed my pathology report to the highest medical authority in Sweden, and they gave directly me a reviewer who wll demand in all journals fr the hospitals and imaging firm.

Conversions of lumpectomy to mastecomy if needed. My hard papable lump, with profilerative papilloma has an inner structure in a cyst thing, that cannot be reached with multiple CNBs. Say, if the lumpectomy margins show BC down to the rib where I have great pain, since 6 months and MRI biopsies done, showing strange older bleeding. Are relevant axiilla nodes or SNB nodes removed at the same time as surgery? Optimal thing would be to take all cancer stuff away at the same time, including nodes. Many ladies seem to have relevant nodes missed by the surgeon. All nodes not taken. I had rich amounts of transformations in my whole skelletton pelvis after total hysterectomy, and none of these transformations were sampled for biopsy. The gyn surgeon, non oncologi surgeon, she had taken all suspicious stuff away. My pathology report of the opereation and specimens removed show the promises samples were not taken. Due to heavy adhesions, in the gyn, abdo. area, no one dares go in with laparoscopi to take new samples, risking perforation of colons. The health authoritey are going to check this up, but making a claim, will risk that future bad treatlment will be done, by collegues, as we have a joined medical journal thing, so the whole country can see you prior treatment.
