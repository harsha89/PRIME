You won't always wake up and have cancer be the first thing on your mind. You will get through this. It might even make you a stronger person. I was 35 when I was diagnosed and I thought it was the end of the world. In some ways it was, but now I'm so much more grateful for every moment I can spend with my kids and family. Ask lots of questions -- and come over to the IDC board too when you're ready. -Tricia",
