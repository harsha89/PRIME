Combine cauliflower, & stock in a sauce pan.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes or until cauliflower is very tender.   Puree soup, in batches if necessary & return to sauce pan.  Add milk or add'l stock or water.  Season to taste.   Freezes well.  Note - You can also use broccoli or a combo of cauliflower & brocolli.  I don't use any milk and have used 1/2 stock and 1/2 water.  I try to use a low sodium stock.  ",

I read likesquirrels experience earlier today and I am just finally responding. How you ladies always reach out to all who are in need is a very special blessing to all. likesquirrels - I have found the medical system to be a glass half empty kind of a place many times as well. They often seem to very reluctant to give us anything positive and sometimes I wonder if it is possibly for legal reasons. Or do they just get broken and cold? Firstly, I think they should be telling you more how they think you are doing based on your blood work results and future scanning. Regular scans can give them a lot of information combined with blood work and how you are feeling. There is one lady on bc.org that is a 10 year survivor that posted on bc.org to inspire many of us. We can do many other things in our life styles to help us in addition to medication. And, the better we feel the more likely we will and are able to do. ie exercise, healthy eating, supplements, complementary treatments. I would suggest counselling or supportive treatment through any means you are comfortable and have access to. (pastor, friends, psychologist etc) I found blogging about my experience has helped. beverlymartinwpg.blogspot.ca Treat yourself well and believe the treatment is working.

Kaayborg - I was on Xeloda from April 2016 to June 2017. The only reason I switched to Ibrance and letrazole was due to the drug company closing deadline for offering it on a compassionate basis in Manitoba. I started at 1650 mg 2 x per day. This was too high of a dose for me and it was gradually reduced to 1150 mg 2 x per day. It is weight based but there is a woman on bc.org that is taking 500 mg 3 x per day without breaks. Not sure what thread it is on but will let you know if I see it. University of Southern California hospitals is recommending 1,000 mg 2 x per day. (flat dose without any variance for weight) They claim they get as good results as higher doses. The worst side affect I had was hand foot syndrome. (burning and pealing) The lower dose helped somewhat. I found it much more tolerable the original chemo that I had in 2008 (FEC T) My qualify of life on Xeloda was pretty ok once the dose was reduced. I got significant response from this xeloda and would potentially go back to it if needed.",

I used to post and bc.org was a regular thing for me. My husband now does research and posts as husband 11. (rabbit photo) A photo of his real pet rabbit actually. Please know that I pray for all of your every day. I too had a liver biopsy which I tolerated well. The toughest part was of course the anxiety and results. Kandy - I hope you tolerated the biopsy ok. Praying for healing and blessings for all of you beautiful women!",
