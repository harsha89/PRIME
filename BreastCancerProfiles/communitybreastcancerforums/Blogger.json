I used masculine colors and a nice geometric design. I wanted it to be something I made so he knew I put some effort into it. He was so grateful. I told him that gratitude was a memory of the heart and I will be forever grateful to him. He also has two daughters (ages 9 & 11) whom I can tell are the light of his life. I also designed and sewed them each a pillow for their bedrooms. I received the cutest thank you notes from them. My PS was very touched. I think your idea of remembering your doctor's is a wonderful idea. I don't think it happens all that often and for them to know they made a difference in someone's life has to be a wonderful feeling. I think a batch of fudge or cookies would even be nice; a labor of love from your kitchen. I love the idea of something homemade. I have been on my reconstruction journey so long we have been together through all the major holidays. I brought him a large tray of Christmas cookies for he and his family. I will do the same this year even if my reconstruction is done. It feels good. Whatever it is I think it is a wonderful idea. Bless you. Suzanne",

I had no pain afterwards, no bandages and no pain pills. My tumor was quite large and there was quite an indention but circumstances were such that I needed to have a BMX so things got complicated for other reasons. The lumpectomy was easy so do not fret over it. I did sleep in a recliner because my own apprehension told me to. I was told there are not a lot of nerves in that area so having very little discomfort is not unusual. With your healthy diet and exercise you will do great. I am not a vegan but I eat clean and healthy. I work out 6 days a week and it made everything easier. Keep up the good work and go into this procedure with strength and courage. You will do great.

It is sleeveless, zips up the front with Velcro pockets on each side to hold tubes. It was so helpful because the tubes sucked. Ha! I had mine in a lot longer than most because my drainage would not stop. I had the left side in for 5 weeks and the right side in for 6 weeks. I think that is very unusual but the vest was terrific. Ask your PS about it because mine had the nurse order it and have it ready for me before I left the hospital. The drainage tubes are not hard to empty but my husband helped me anyways. My PS also had antibiotics, pain pills and muscle relaxers ready for me. You will be very glad you have the muscle relaxers when they start filling the TE's. I slept in a recliner for a long time. I highly recommend it if you have one. I was not comfortable laying perfectly flat so the slight incline was perfect. I took sponge baths until the tubes were removed. After that I took shallow baths until my incisions healed completely. It was quite a while before I felt comfortable enough to shower. I lotioned up all the time. It just felt good to smell good and have my skin feel so soft. Be good to yourself, my dear. Make sure you stay your priority. That is very important. I went to my hair stylist once a week for a good shampoo. He gave me a good twist with his curling iron and I felt ready to accept people who came to wish me well. You won't have much of an appetite but keep your strength up and drink lots of water. I guess this happens at different times for every woman and it happened to me in the middle of my journey. I have never been prone to mood swings, depression or anything but, about 3 months into this journey all I wanted to do was cry. I did not know what was happening and I didn't know what to do about it. I read on this blog that some women go on anxiety medication. I did not want that. Then I read something that made perfect sense. \"The breast tissue that was removed is hormone retaining tissue so it takes a while for your hormones to rebalance themselves.\" Finally something that made sense to me. I was patient, talked to my husband for support and tried to keep busy. It slowly got better and I started feeling like my old self once again. I hope this explanation helps if this happens to you. You are NOT alone. The TE's are an interesting phenomenon. They get uncomfortable but not unbearable. They are only temporary so talk to me if need be. You will get through them with no problem. I had Mentor high profile silicone implants and my TE's were filled to 680 cc's. After the exchange the implants look smaller than the TE's because they are soft and not as much projection. Keep that in mind. Many women are very unhappy after the exchange because they look too small. One last piece of advice that a breast cancer survivor told me was: LET YOURSELF HEAL. DON'T RUSH BACK DOING ANYTHING BEFORE YOU ARE READY!!! That's all I can think of except your time in the hospital is short so let the nurses do everything they can to help you. I did not find this surgery to be unusually painful. They cut a lot of nerves and it takes weeks for them to wake up. I was really in need of some peppermint gum. I did not have any so I had my husband bring me some. Plan on having something peppermint with you whether it be gum or mints or something. Even after brushing my teeth the peppermint was so refreshing. Just a small, inconsequential tip that helped me. Wow! I hope I did not overwhelm you with too much info all at once. Don't worry, my friend. I, too, was nervous about the lymph node diagnosis so there are things that we have to wait to find out which isn't the easiest to do. I was blessed with clean nodes and I hope and pray you will have the same good news. I did not get many breaks in my cancer journey so I deserved that one. You deserve it, too. Let me know, after reading all this info, if more questions popped up for you. I am here for you. Suzanne",

My PS told me mine would expand slowly because my pec muscles were so strong due to all the powerlifting I was doing. I had them in for 4 1/2 months which I heard was not too long. I found them uncomfortable but not unbearable. I, too, slept in a recliner which was my salvation. I could not sleep in a bed for a long time. Even tho I never got totally comfortable I was able to sleep. Did your PS give you any muscle relaxers to take? I found that the first couple of days after a fill were the worst and then it got better until the next time. Ask your PS for muscle relaxers. They really helped me. I would like to tell you that the pressure gets better but, as you get larger, the expanders get harder and more uncomfortable. My breast surgeon said: \"short term pain for long term gain.\" Easy for them to say, right? I have had my exchange surgery last February and am still getting used to the implants. Even tho they are soft and pliable I still feel very tight. My PS tells me this is my new normal. Check with your PS and see what he/she says about this. You might not like the feel of implants once your TE's are out. Worthy heckling into. It's a challenging journey. How many fills have you had? How many left to go? I had to wait for 6 weeks after the last fill for my muscles to calm down to be ready for the exchange. Hand in there; you can make it! This reconstruction is a long, bumpy road. It it will all be worth it.i I am still going through it so I can relate. The pressure is totally normal. The TE's are doing their job. They have been placed behind pec muscles so they have to be temporary workhorses. Hang in there. You will make it! Suzanne",

It is a very long and challenging journey, much more so than I ever dreamed it would be. I don't know what I was expecting but it has been quite a journey. First, ask your PS if he has a book you can read on the exact silicone implants he will be using BEFORE he puts the expanders in. You want to know ALL your options because silicone might not be the best option for you. My PS gave me the book explaining silicone after my expanding was completely done and I was waiting for the exchange surgery. There is a lot of scary information regarding silicone implants you should know before deciding. I have silicone and am going back into surgery because one took on a life of its own and has become square. The TE's took some time getting used to. As time goes on and they get filled with saline they get harder and a bit uncomfortable. After all, they are placed under your pec muscles so the muscles can stretch to accommodate the implants. My PS gave me a prescription for muscle relaxers which I took the first couple days after the expanding. Then your muscles start to relax and by the third day I was feeling better. They are not happy for a couple of days. Remember: Short term pain for long term gain. The saline is inserted through a port by a syringe. It does not hurt because your nerves are totally asleep from your mastectomy. I had 7 fills which took approx. 4 1/2 months. I was filled a little slowly because I am an amateur power lifter and my pec muscles are so strong they stretched slower. It has been three months and I am getting prepared for nipple reconstruction. I am 9 months into it. Take your time; there is no need to rush. We need to keep in touch. We are on like journey's and walk our path together. Suzanne",

Plus, I read in many sources that the faster they fill the expanders the more pain you will be in. It makes sense that your muscles are reacting to 150 cc's all at one time and then more to boot. I was never filled more than 60 cc's at a time. I also read if a person is in too much pain they can remove some of the saline the same way they put it in to give them some relief. I feel so horrible for you. I hurt just hearing about you, my dear sister. My next question to you is: why can't they be removed? I have heard many women making that decision. Some women even go through the whole expansion process, have their exchange surgery only to have their permanent implants removed because of the tight feeling from them. There is ALOT we are not told ahead of time. I, for one, had my exchange surgery feb. 19 and I still feel like I am wrapped up with duct tape. My PS tells me that is my \"new normal.\" It would have been nice to know about this before hand. You have to get some relief either from your BS or PS. They have to help you. January 14 is a long ways away. I hope you can stop filling for awhile. Let your pec muscles calm down and adjust to the added pressure. I have some muscle relaxers left from my expansion. They sure helped me through some rough spots. They made me sleepy so I took them before I went to bed so I could sleep. I would find out WHY they won't prescribe them for you. I have the prescription right in front of me and it is called: Methocarbamol 750 MG Tablet. Take one tablet by mouth every 6 hours for muscle spasms. I was lucky because I only had spasms the day of and one day after a fill. Please keep me posted on how you are doing. Nobody should be in that much pain with no relief. I am so sorry you are going through this. I wish I could do something to help. Please ask your doctor(s) once again. Now that you have a name, see what they say. It was a Godsend for me. I have a very, very good PS with high credentials and he would never prescribe anything harmful. I did not need chemo but I can't understand why that would change anything. I don't know, tho. I am thinking about you. It is a long, challenging journey. Please stay strong and stay in touch. Suzanne",

They are safe and they work. You should not have to endure the kind of misery you are in. And, until next January? NO WAY! I feel very lucky that the expanders were not that bad for me. I was uncomfortable but it was not unbearable. I did not have chemo and they were in for 4.5 months. I was filled with approx. 60 cc's each time and I stopped at 680 cc's. My exchange surgery was feb. 19, 2013. I am sad to report to you that my silicone implants are TIGHT. I feel like I am wrapped in duct tape all the time. My PS tells me it is my \"new normal.\" I read an article in the NYTimes last week That was written by a woman who had a BMX with silicone 5 years ago. She still feels very tight. The implants are soft and pliable like normal breast tissue (not at all like those rock hard expanders) but they do feel tight. This Friday (June 7) I am going to have further surgery because the silicone implant on the left side is being affected by scar tissue created in the exchange surgery. The vertical scar created is shrinking and putting pressure on the soft implant forcing it to flatten on top and take on a square look. The scar has to be released and some fat grafting has to be done to fill in the crease. What a mess. You will find this interesting. In the same NYT article it said that 94,000+ implant surgeries are performed each year. Of that number 64,000+ are silicone. Of the silicone 19,000+ are removed for one reason for another. I think those numbers are staggering. You demand to get some relief. January is too far off to be in such pain. Nobody understands except those who have been through it. Good luck with your chemo tomorrow. I will be praying for you and know that all of you \"sisters\" are with you, also. Please let me know what happens and how you are doing. Suzanne (blogger)",

It is my first time with breast cancer but I had uterus cancer years ago. I, too, was very nervous about lymph nodes. I had good news and they were clear. The waiting is the worst. I had a BMX and am still going through the reconstruction process. There have been several bumps in the road but am hoping this next surgery on June 7 will be the last one. I wish you clear sailing through this most difficult time. Keep up your strength, courage, determination and hope and all will be well. My story will is going to have a happy ending and so will yours. Keep the faith, trust in your doctors, continue on this forum because it is wonderful, keep us posted on all you are going through and trust in yourself. Be your own best advocate. Recovery was not as bad as I had thought. You will come hoIme with tubes but they are very temporary. Be good to yourself and don't overdue. This surgery was not painful for me. Are you having tissue expanders put in by a plastic surgeon at the same time as your mastectomy? I can give an awful lot of info on silicone implants if that is the route you are considering. You will be OK. Take a few deep breaths when things get overwhelming. The wait is the worst but try not to worry. My dad always said you might be worrying for nothing and often times that was the case. Please keep me posted. I will be in surgery the day after you. Let's compare notes when you feel up to it. I will be praying for you. Blessings will come out of this journey; they have for me. Suzanne",

I could not sleep laying flat so the incline was great. Are you planning on beginning reconstruction right away? You will need to find a plastic surgeon if that is the case.

Let's hope there is nothing to worry about. Please take someone with you. My sis-in-law went the first time with a paper and pen in hand. She took copious notes and it was great.

He was telling me things the doctor said that I did not remember. My lumpectomy went very well. No pain and very little scarring. In my case the tumor was so large (including the margins they had to take) that I had a pretty good size indention. That would have had to be fixed if I did not need the BMX.

Let me tell you how God works in this breast cancer journey. First of all: GOD IS GOOD and so are you. He does NOT punish; what bunk! My PS has a mission in So. America. He and his colleagues volunteer two weeks each year and do cleft palette surgeries on infants whose families are too poor to afford it.

It is everything from buying socks and underwear to sewing bags, fun hospital gowns, no-no arm bands, etc. This is exactly the place my breast cancer journey has taken me and it has become more blessings than challenges.

I could have used them a few months ago but felt so great reading them right now. Strength, courage, dignity all came home to me and your words did, also. So profound, so encouraging, so hopeful. What s good \"sister\" you are. Thank you and I am so grateful. Suzanne",

You will get through this my dear sister. I am coming into my 9th month of my journey and it has brought challenges and blessings. Hang in there and I will continue my vigil.",
