    "Content": "mgreene7 wrote: Hi everyone. I had recently put a post on here this past week, telling my story. But briefly...I am 29 and have found I think two lumps in my right breast recently. One feels more oblong, rather than round. and the other \"lump\" isnt really a lump...but feels more like hardness or thickness in a section of my breast by the armpit.  My OBGYN had me schedule a mammorgram and ultrasound for next week.  Prior to maybe a week and a half ago, I was not having any pain. But every since my obgyn visit (where she did breast exam and pushed quite a bit on it) I have had sometimes dull pain, sometimes shooting pain in this breast. If I feel and push on these lumps, it is very painful and sore...and now, I'd say the last couple of days, i've had kind of a dull pain going down my arm at times. But mostly, always a pain in my chest...above the nipple and then closer to the armpit. Does anyone have any opinions or experience with this? from what i've read...most people who've found cancer...have had no pain. I go for mammo on monday and then see surgeon on friday.  Thanks - everyone on here is so supportive and helpful it seems! Scared mom in NY Log in to post a reply",
