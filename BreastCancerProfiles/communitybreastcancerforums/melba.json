I was diagnosed last year , had 6 lymph nodes removed, all negative, treated proactively and for the most part did not have many issues with the LE, wore compression sleeve and gauntlet during the day, massaged and exercised the arm.  It has been about two months and now my thumb is always swollen, diagnosed with carpal tunnel , both hands .  Swelling is only on the Lymphedema side. I have now worked with three qualified LE therapists.  I am considering changing from Arimidex to Femera, my onc gave me the script.  I am told much of the flare ups are probably due to the medicine but it is extremely limiting and painful.  I will try everything before surgery but may have to face it if it doesn't resolve.  I even contacted the National Lymphedema Network.  It seems no one has any clear cut answers.  I also met with the hand surgeon who was not terrribly well versed on Lymphedema,  He even suggested it may be the carpal tunnel causing the swelling, not the Lymphedema.  If I seriously consider surgery I may ask the hand surgeon to consult with the Lymphedema specialist, not sure how that will go.",
