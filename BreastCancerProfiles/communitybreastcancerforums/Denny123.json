I don't know how much higher the SUV score is, so I am anxious to read over the report. BUT, it turns out that I also have pneumonia! I had a bad cold a couple of weeks ago, which I always dreaded since I can't blow my nose. Then I started coughing up bloody mucous, which I figured was because I can't blow my nose. I didn't go to my PCP since I knew that I couldn't get my PET scan if I was on antibiotics. I figured anything would show up on the PET, and it did. So now I am on Cipro for 10 days which upsets my stomach. So I will stay on Kadcyla for at least 3-4 months. Escorpion-the nose bleeds come and go and are totally unpredictable. The best advice that I got on here was to put Afrin on a Q-Tip and swab the inside of my nostrils. That slows down the bleeding if it is just dripping. And YAY for a hegative BRCA!!!! Pasque-welcome!!! Kadcyla really isn't too bad. I am a 15 year (as of tomorrow) survivor of Stage 4 BC, nad have been on chemo the whole time. So it is hitting me harder than most.

My nose bleeds on Kadcyla are making me crazy-just starts for no reason. 5 days in a row now. Even when I wake up during the night, and laying there quietly, it starts to bleed. But at least I can get it stopped in about 15 minutes, and no more trips to the ER for packing. Just read on BC.mets site about a new chemo pill....Tucatinib, 2 pills daily currently in a Phase 2 clinical trail. Seems to be much like Tykerb, but easier.

But they sure aren't like ours! I have the Equate brand of Generic Afrin, and will definitely keep it in mind. What is funny is that I have a store on eBay and participate on a sellers discussion board and I have been whining about my bleeds. One of the gals on that board, who doesn't get chemo, has had nosebleeds for years and an ER resident told her the same thing about Afrin. I had sinus surgery for a deviated septum on my left side about 3 years ago. I had a cauterization about a year ago, and now with the worse bleeding, my ENT said that I don't need any more cauterizations. So tell me, does your left eye water then? There are others in this thread who also have (like me), a very watery right eye and bleeding left nostril. No doctor can figure out that one! Booger Buddies Unite!",

If so, they are a foreign object just like a knee replacement. If you had a Tram flap or DIEP, you probably don't need antibiotics. I just had a filling today and my dentist said that I didn't need antibiotics, but I took 300mg of Cleosin anyway. When you have your teeth cleaned, is when the bacteria can enter your blood stream and cause an infection in your implants. So it depends on what kind of dental work you are having and if you had saline or silicone. Be sure to take a Probiotic, if you do take them.",

So anyway, I now know that as soon as the pains start, that I should hit the Motrin.",

Watch for nose bleeds and if they start, try not to blow your nose.  Kadcyla thins the linings of the nasal passages so the capillaries are too close to the surface.  The best thing for bleeds is to put a bit of Afrin on a Q-tip and swab the inside of the nasal passages.  It constricts the passages and halts the bleeding.  Or you can spray Afrin into the nose, when needed.",

So I just had my second tx yesterday. Kadcyla is a super Herceptin, so just might be better for her. I am a 13 year survivor of Stage 4 BC, with original liver mets. So I am well beyond the Perjeta stage since there are guidelines for previous treatments. I currently am on Faslodex and Kadcyla, and my nurses are very encouraging that the combo will do a great job, as it has for many other patients.

And the best advice that I read on here was to put a few drops of Afrin on a Q-Tip and swab the inside of the bleeding nostril. If it won't stop bleeding, put Afrin on a bit of cotton, insert into the nose and hold it shut for 10 minutes. That will stop the bleeding.

They are much better than the Kytril that I had gotten at first.  At home, I take Compazine for a week if needed. I can't take Zofran for the first week since either Emend or Aloxi has the same ingredients as Zofran. I used to be offered a Tylenol as a pre-med, but never needed it for a fever. Don't know if anyone else heard this, but there is a shortage of saline since it was produced in Puerto Rico and the plant has been destroyed.  So I had one of my pre-meds as a push to save on saline. I asked about my Alt again, and mine is shown as SGOT for the AST which is 44, and SGPT for the ALT which is 40.  My nurse said it is fine.",

In April I had to go to the ER since my nose would not stop bleeding. Kadcyla thins the lining of the nasal passages, thus making the capillaries too close to the skin surface. Since my nose runs a lot on Kadcyla, I had been blowing it lightly once in awhile. But just that was enough to cause irritation. The irritation caused bleeding, and then clotting. So then I was blowing my nose to get out the clots, which made everything worse. But since I have quit blowing my nose all together, I seldom even have the thin bloody discharge.

I had major nose bleeds Thursday night through Friday afternoon. I sure didn't enjoy those. Used the Cotton ball soaked with Afrin treatment which did stop the bleeding for a few hours. Then it would start again. I will get Kadcyla again tomorrow and see my onc. I will beg him for a PET scan ASAP since I hate to wait for too long between the scans. I have been on Kadcyla for 2 years and 9 months. Fun times. Love to all, Denise",

Since I have been sprung from the home and am finally getting around, the bleeding has started again, but not as bad as it had been initially, 3 1/2 years when I first started the tx. What I read on a Kadcyla site is that it thins the membranes of the nasal linings, thus bringing the capillaries closer to the surface...so, yes it is an SE! My nose did bleed more the first 2 years of my tx with Kadcyla and last Thanksgiving, for some reason, it bled copiously all day!  And most of the bleeding was originally on my left side, but now it is also on the right side.  I did have sinus surgery a few years ago for the deviation. Anywho, I have found that Afrin dripped onto a Q-Tip swabbed into the nasal passages really helps.  If not, I drop a few drops into each nostril which finally stops it.  Sometimes I have to lay down until the stuff finally clots.",

But it was a good decision to not radiate it since I got more cancerous nodes.....so obviously I needed chemo that would go through my whole system to protect it. So you could have it removed with surgery, radiation, or see if chemo would reduce it.  So, like DL3 says, wait to see what your onc says, and maybe he can discuss the situation with your radiation onc.",

I had one tx on Feb 28.  I had mild nausea for about 10 days, but no throwing up.  Occasional bloody nose-but only when I blow it.  Fatigue as usual, since my reds are down.   My nurses told me that I would not lose my hair.

So they gave me samples of a triple antibiotic ointment (Neomycin, Polymyxin and Bacitracin). So far, no bleeds....but we will see. Funny, they also suggested the AYR too.

Well, yesterday was the beginning of my 16th year since being diagnosed with Stage 4 breast cancer.  I saw my onc today for the results of my PET scan. The cancerous node by my esophagus is about the same size, but more active.  But the tumors above my heart and the one at the entrance to my lungs have both gotten bigger, more active, and joined together to make one large node. So I am off Kadcyla now, after almost 4 years.  I have to take a month break and meanwhile will go through genomic testing for possible targeted therapy.  The testing searches for genomic alterations that can occur through time, and maybe there is a different kind of chemo that might stop the cancer. I will also go through consideration of a clinical trial Phase 2, of a new chemo, called Poziotinib. If I fail to qualify for either of the above options, I will have to go on a standard, but really hard combo of Xeloda and Tykerb, both of which are chemo pills. Radiation is not an option since I have already had rads to my left side. What a crappy year this has been.  Still recovering from a broken femur and shoulder from a fall in April.  I lost my 38 year old daughter in July.  And my other daughter is going to file for a divorce in a few days.  Now this.  Makes one wonder if stress really helps cancer to grow. I will still stop back in to visit everyone here.",

I will continue to read this thread since it appears that no one else so far is participating in the Poziotinib trial.  There are only 70 ladies in the USA on this clinical trial. I might find out in 2 days if I can go on it, and am hoping that the CT scans will be paid for since I would have to have them every 6 weeks.  On a monthly income of only $900, I sure can't afford to pay for them!  Medicare is reluctant to pay for clinical trials.

I have been on Poziotinib for a week, and so far (maybe since I have been constipated for 4 years from the Kadcyla), no diarrhea.  I am taking stool softeners, actually. I had nausea for the first 3 days, but not the puking kind.   So far my side effects are mouth sores, a sore scalp, acne around my mouth, my nose bleeds are worse, loss of appetite, dry mouth, only a few finger cracks. But the best part is the weight loss!  I lost about 5 pounds in a week!  If I lose 17 more pounds I will be back to my pre-BC weight, which would be great. I eat a very small meal every 3 hours. I take 2 pills per day for 2 weeks, then I will have a week off.  Then 2 more weeks of pills, etc. My home-health psychology nurse daughter inquired about home health care, which will help, since they can access my chest port for the bloodwork that I need to get tomorrow.  I am in PA with frigid temps and snow. And I will have a number to call 24/7 with questions....like on day 2 when I had an allergic reaction in the late evening and my throat started to close up.  I took a Benadryl, which helped that, but wasn't sure if I could.  Talked to my nurse the next day and she said that Prednisone or Benadryl would work.  I prefer the OTC Benadryl. That hasn't happened again since that first day. Denise",

My heart ejection fraction actually went up with my last echo-between 55-60. Gemzar was sooo easy for me-just a little nausea the evening of treatment, and some hair thinning.  I did have a very fine light rash, nothing major(made me look healthy and rosy!).  I also drank 4 ounces of RED grape juice daily as it is supposed to help with the platelets, and my platelets were fine the whole time.  (Can't hurt-might help category)! Please feel free to ask any other questions.  If my liver mets return, I will definitely go back on Gemzar. Denise",

I had Gemzar with Herceptin and 9 months later my liver went into remission, and I am still in remission, 5 1/2+ years later. I am on Herceptin for life, and have no SE's at all with it. With all of my tumors, I had no pain, so I agree that the pains could be caused by something else.  When I did start on Gemzar, I did have some liver pains and my onc said that that meant that the Gemzar was working.  And he was right.  After that, the pains were much easier to tolerate-knowing that the chemo was kicking butt.

I think a biopsy is indicated to make sure that the liver mets are from the breast cancer.  They may be from another primary CA and different chemos wold be required. Otherwise, if the mets are from BC, there are many other chemos that can do a great job. Best of luck to you! Denise",
