I don't know too much about it but it probably depends on what chemos have been tried previously. I did carboplatin with gemcitabine, others I've seen mention carboplatin with tamoxifen. Carboplatin seems like a common choice for TNBC. I found the side effects fairly tolerable just hard on the platelet counts and started having abnormal liver enzyme levels. My brain met was surgically removed so I don't know how effective it was in my brain but it cleared up a local recurrence in my lymph nodes after 3 cycles. Hopefully it cleared up any micro-nasties in my brain too.",

I asked my oncologist if it penetrates the brain barrier and she said there is evidence to believe it can especially when there is some swelling/injury to the brain. Apparently this disrupts the brain barrier a bit.",

At my last check up they told me it was from the radiation, kind of like scarring I guess. I've had recent scans and there's no disease there. It has improved with time. If it doesn't improve in a couple of weeks though, I would ask them to check it out. It is worth while even just for your own emotional well being. I know every time I have an odd ache or pain I keep poking and prodding it. Then I'm not sure if I'm causing the pain by constantly touching it. :) I hope you get some answers soon to put your mind at ease. Ally ",

Everyday my thoughts are consumed with cancer. I struggle to find hope even though these boards are so positive. I feel stuck. Unable to make plans. Unable to have a career or even carry on a normal life. My health is really good at the moment but the physiological toll is enormous. I don't feel I can talk to anyone about it because no one wants to believe I'm dying. I hesitate to post these feeling in the community because I don't want to steal someone else's hope. I just wanted to say thank you because you made me feel a little less alone today. Ally",
