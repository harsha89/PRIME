Of course my family decided everyone needed to go get a mammogram. My mom came back clear, my sister came back clear. I got a call early last week after my 3D mammogram saying they wanted me to come back for an ultrasound. I was on vacation when they called and scheduled it for Wednesday thinking it was just my first mammogram and they didn\u2019t have anything to compare to. In the meantime they posted the report, \u201cPossble 11mm spiculated left breast upper outer quadrant nodule in mid one third depth.\u201d After googling all that stuff I\u2019m thinking my odds aren\u2019t great of being cancer free. I haven\u2019t said anything to my mom as she\u2019s having a hard enough time dealing with my sisters recent diagnosis. I\u2019ve discussed with my hubby a bit but he thinks I\u2019m being paranoid. Just want everyone\u2019s real thoughts and want to be realistic.

My sister (age 39) was diagnosed with stage 4 exactly 3 months before I was diagnosed (the only reason I know about mine is her Genetic Councilor telling her to have her sisters checked). She tested negative for the gene (mine is still pending). I chose bilateral mastectomy for a few reasons. 1) Obviously having a sister diagnosed at stage 4 makes me want to do everything I can to avoid a recourrence. I know had she been given that option she\u2019s surely take it over her diagnosis any day. 2) I know it will always be there making me check worrying me & stressing me out. 3) My surgeon said while they may they may the same after recon reconstruction; they won\u2019t age the same. 4) Having ILC puts me at a higher risk for other cancers & ILC likes to hide on imaging. Best of luck on whatever you choose. It\u2019s just a personal choice. I very hard personal choice",
