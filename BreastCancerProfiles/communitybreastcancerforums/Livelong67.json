      "Content": "Livelong67 wrote: I had two prior occurrences of ER+ HER2- PR+ breast cancer in same breast. Prior occurrence was 2005 where I had mastectomy and give years of Zoladex. In Jan of last year, I found a mass on my sternum and spots on my lung that were suspicious of metastasis. The pet scan showed the activity on the sternum, but most spots except one were benign and one was inconclusive. The biopsy on the sternum showed 99% ER+ and oncologist indicated that if I responded to AIs and Ibrance that they could potentially \"kill it off\" with radiation although there was the possibility of micro cells elsewhere in my body. Long story but I had to switch oncologists to another facility and she also said potentially \"curative\". Again had to switch and my current oncologist goes back and forth. He initially said that even though nothing showed on the pet scan, that they kind of assume \"the horse is out of the box\" and so it's likely that there are micro cells elsewhere so risks outweighed the benefits of radiation. That was one visit. My CA27-29 have been bouncing up and down a bit between 37 and went up as far as 43 this week and I had another scan today and await the results. But same guy then said radiation to the sternum might be considered. Of course depending on the results of the scan, the question might be moot but wondered if anyone has or had a solitary metastasis and if so was it treated differently? Of course perhaps those people who were treated maybe with radiation or surgery (mine is inoperable), they may not be on this forum any more. I feel so confused and am getting conflicting information. Thanks to all for their help. Log in to post a reply",
