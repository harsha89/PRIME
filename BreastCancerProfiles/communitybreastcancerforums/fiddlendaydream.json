I meet with my doctor in a week and we will discuss the pathology. My questions are: 1) Are any of these areas considered pre-cancer? 2) Having removed these masses, am I still considered at high risk for sometime in the future developing cancer 3) There has been talk about me going on Tamoxifen, I'm concerned about this. what would be the criteria for putting me on this medication if no cancer comes back in the pathology report. 4) is it unusual to be diagnosed with all of the conditions that I've been diagnosed?
