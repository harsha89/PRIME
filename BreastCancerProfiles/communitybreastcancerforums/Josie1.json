My onc. just said last week that needing 3 recipes in a year moves me into a \"bad\" category, and clinical trials are needed to give me more time. ( talk about destroying hope!). I am now waiting to see if I can get into a clinical trial -appt is this Friday ( I think gem-carbo plus something). My onc.'s office just called to schedule an appt for next week. (I had understood I'd move to the clinical trial's doctor if accepted). Trying hard not to read that this means I don't qualify and will start standard gem-carbo.. 3 weeks now \"flushing out\" capecitabine that hadn't \"performed as hoped\", (approx. 8 weeks on it and new spine and liver mets found). So I've had no meds lately and that has been scary too. hope people get nothing but good news, Josie",

I've been on a break to flush out for this clinical trial and I'm certain the mass in my neck has enlarged: sore jaw, visible facial neck and temple swelling, helped with hot compresses and Tylenol. Lots of coughing and breathlessness. my prior small brain metastasis was treated once with a cyberknife - hi dose radiation -think like a laser. very easy and effective. with this extra fluid its like an hour long ice cream headache. I'm hoping this subsides if I respond to this drug.I will settle down once some type of treatment is underway. Again its so great to read about N ED.. tho what a bummer to struggle with all those extra issues. I hope they will subside too. I am so much also enjoying reading about others' clinical trials. thanks for posting everyone. Tomorrow I find out whether .I am still a candidate for the clinical trial - they will review the results from the 3 ct scans and all the blood work and tell me. Needless to say, here I am online after midnight instead of sleeping! hope all of you can enjoy some peace of mind this week. I will be thinking of everyone.",

I guess I could \"post a reply\" to each topic that spoke to me, or I could comment and see where that goes.. I'm afraid from despite all my reading, I don't yet have everyone's names and comments linked properly in my memory!however, here goes: -I love the piece (Mtinxie)? where you see you are NED. that is so encouraging to see! and that it was such a time until recurrence. that bodes well! I've recently met with a research oncologist who thinks my TNBC was present originally, was missed by my TAC treaments in 2008, and hid during Tamoxifen and Aromasin and has surfaced this last year in my neck nodes and is populating other places now...hmmmm? -also glad to see options suggested nrsteph re. funds. In Canada, its not the same picture really. We don't do PETs at this time, tho I guess I could try finding privately. I think my MRI and CT scans give answers. We also don't do tumour markers as my onc's say the numbers are too unreliable and there's no standard yet to say what means what with such variances between individuals. (my interpretation of that info anyway). -to ksmatthews: my thought too are to get more opinions/ information. Originally last summer, I was told the \"median survival rate\" that matches your time frame, but was then told its now 30 months(ish) but that people are at other ends to much shorter to NED; BUT all oncologists have said that no statistic can be applied to an individual so I hope your situation unfolds in a new light with more info! I think the big picture is to just keep living and trying to find treatments that can optimize that in terms of quality of life and length of time.. -Texas Rose- congrats on retirement! and on your own timeline.. hope its full of fun developments. I was off on short term sick leave until early spring when everything got intense with lots of new, not good growths and I thought it would be tough on coworkers, me and people I work with directly to go through those ups and downs. I really grieved going onto LT disability ( so lucky to have benefits, but so sad to leave a wonderful workplace).. -and lastly, not to fuss too much, but I've had facial pain too: Roseio - I didn't see more details for you, but for me it was because I had extra lymph fluid in neck and area that was due to cancer growth. Because the area around my jaw neck and hairline was so tender, my MD thought TMJ. When I mentioned to my onc she scanned and could see my neck lymph node mass was increasing in size. Originally, shortly after diagnosis of my recurrence last year I had a similar discomfort in the same area, thought I had an ear infection, and had my ear inflate to a bubble without any of its regular curls and indents. My onc explained that was an earlier example of the same scenario. So from my history, I would at least ask the question, could it be lymph fluid, and if so, why is there extra?? I too check to see what action there is and I'm glad to see all the posts. I feel lonely - alone? sometimes as I may have said there's no metastatic disease support group and no TNBC group here and I am the embodiment of everyone's worst nightmare when I dropped by at a local breast cancer support group! :) Wishing everyone well, Josie  ",

Fabulous news is that I'm still stable and even some mets are smaller again !!! :0) They have seen some inflammation in the brain area where I had cyberknife surgery Sept '15 that may be explained by my perhaps having a flu (to explain the nausea/vomiting), but the other alternative: the swelling is a growth that's causing the nausea/vomiting.

It is so helpful to read about people's scan fears, about their minds tricking them, about scary swelling, and about trying to figure out what our bodies might be trying to tell us - I always appreciate hearing about longer times on certain recipes.. Donna - that oozing and drying up cycle sounds so frightening. Is the area around the growth infected/stressed? will antibiotics or disinfectant (hydrogen peroxide??) be helpful. I sure would expect your onc. to give you management strategies as I'm thinking our teams' role is to help us live with this condition and its side effects. Steph, I have never had a PET scan. They are not done in Canada regularly. I am waiting anxiously for CT scans the last week in Oct. When I was on a trial treatment I was CT scanned with contrast after 1 month and my liver had one met in particular that went from approx 3 cm to 8 cm in that time. Because I was so sick at the time I couldn't feel any symptoms that could signal changes. My new recipe, CMF (Juli I am so glad to see your great history with this!) - started the day after the scan results - have had me feeling stronger and stronger each week. The scans will be after treatment #4 with cmf next week. Kay, I can't believe you have shrinkage. I will love it if I have some stability.. Here's hoping. And BarbDenise, you and your children are on my mind. I hope you have more news and may be able to keep us posted. all the best wishes for everyone - J.",

It lets kids feel valued for who they are and showing them they can nurture too. No matter when we leave their lives, that has to be a lasting core they will hopefully have as adults.. (I am tearing up here as I am believing this to ideally be true with my family - and for other people living with mTNBC too).. a kind, wise friend recently told me I don't have to try to live 30 years, but instead try to live to the next new trial, or the next new treatment, and that gies me some peace at times.. Which brings me to my next comment: Thanks minxie, sherriw, kaayborg, donnad, amber and anyone else I've missed, for the resources, info on new drugs and links to trials and emerging info..it helps me feel better prepared when I meet with my onc... and to carry on from nrsteph's post: I also am angry on your behalf, having been there too with crazy info and mixed directions.. I think Onc.'s need to be held accountable for their conflicting, contradictory treatment plans. This is all a big muddle that's so unique to each individual. We are experts on our bodies (and you are trying to relearn them, and to again trust your instincts that seem to have let you down so drastically - speaking for myself).., but Onc.s have wider exposure to other people with TNBC -- they should have better skills with people to address all the confusion and pain. I get tired of feeling I have to be so clinical and informed to participate in this process .. I feel sometimes I am having to get information and have to ask my questions in certain ways and use certain buzz words to get a fuller briefing - come in with my reference numbers, researchers' names.. and I am so tired sometimes..!!! TexasRose, so sorry that CMF stopped working.. I will cross anything that can be crossed that good results give you stability on your next recipe. I got the first good news in a year about my health that my 3 CMF doses are doing something! A whopper liver met found in the spring had doubled from 1ish cm to 2ish cm , and other developments in my lungs and aorta area etc had lead to my stopping Xeloda and starting a clinical trial in July. during the 4 weeks between scans on that trial, that met became 8.3 cm! CMF started the next day and that met is now halved, as are most others; bone mets are stable - and nothing new found!!! phew for now.. :) I was thinking of you on your patio in Texas when I was bundled up Monday night looking at the Super Moon here in Ottawa... Kaayborg, your inlaw event was too, too real 2 weeks ago. We learned - while updating wills and financial planning (based on my onc's very blunt info - and our \"prepare for the worst, hope for the best\" approach to life) - that my dh's health wasn't what last year's regular annual physical had left us believing.. He had a nosebleed that wasn't stopping -72 hours off and on- and our GP luckily took a BP reading, and then 3 others. She wouldn't let him leave the appointment without a prescription. The \"tightness\" he hasn't told me about (his thinking it was stress with all our cancer stuff, just self-managing through deep, calming breaths) - all have started good solid steps: testing, bloodwork, prescriptions, 6 followup appointments at 2 week intervals. His mother: \"They don't what they're talking about.. don't fuss - look at your father and me\", implying they are the picture of health. they are not. We have always lived healthy and ate sensibly, but this is a big tap on the shoulder that he needs not to handle everything, and keep quiet to shelter me. sister-sister, I am glad you are out of hospital. my lung situation is improving but I was close to all that in the summer. I am learning from what you share.. and I again want to repeat that this thread is so necessary to me and how much I appreciate everyone's comments and participation. Even just knowing that others are out there and just, like me at heavy times, viewing the thread, helps. good wishes to all, J.",

I live in central Canada and we have some good clinical trials in Toronto Montreal and Ottawa. ...and minxie, sister-sister kaayborg rgc and rhys I'm all reading to compare symptoms and treatments.. CMF still seems to be OK for now and my brain seems Ok too. Rgc, cyberknife was great for me and I could take in a cd from home to view which was the Earth series -1 on oceans and space -very celestial for me. I have seen a team who say I don't complain enough - they are all about symptom management. so big shake-up : 10 radiation sessions as I learned its likely my secretions and spewing are due to some disease higher in my neck behind my jaw. They can't see my jugular and so backup arteries are helping but that's why facial swelling pain breathlessness and secretions - which can be improved. Also on decadron (sp?) to help with swelling, appetite (sister-sister - maybe a steroid to improve appetite and weight gain for you too?). other pill regime too, but seems do-able. also found out I have LITRES of fluid around my lungs so possible draining, but I want to wait until rads done.they start on Friday. I also have lost function in my left arm and painful too now. also due to disease at c3-8? messing with my bracchial plexus.They are hoping some decreased swelling may offer gains. wishing everyone stability - in whatever shape its needed!

I think Halvaren may be in my future too.. my treatment schedule changed bcuz of my platelet count for gem carbo but they will try gemcarbo, gem, then rest week .. here's hoping I can proceed on Thursday as it was cancelled last week. My swallow has improved and my left lung is draining minimum 500 ml every m, w and fri so my breathing sleeping and coughing all greatly improved!!! Hang in there 4everstrong ..

I will get gem and carbo this week 7 days after and then gem again. I am scared as I am so tired- just move from chair to couch and nap this last week. Not sure I can handle this next round I have been warned both will be challenging with nausea and fatigue. I will take emend zofran and decadron to manage but ??? How is your regime going?

I was reading a thread \"sh*t people say to mbc \" and lauging and relating - I think thats why its so hard to tell people as you can't anticipate their reactions and end up needing to support people while you are still learning how to talk about it.. ive had some friendships become incredibly deeper. I agree about relying on a healhy diet for health but I have concentrated on making sure my salads smoothies and juices bring a greater variety of fruits and vegetables and just extra volume as I sometimes can't eat enough due to fatigue or heat. One woman on a thread specifically added papaya and pumpkin (not what she ate frequently) to stay on her same chemo schedule as her platelets got low and was reporting it worked for her. (I take notes on bits like that and wonder what the future holds!) I was able to start the trial. Daily trips to the hospital for ekgs and bloodwork. one dose 1st week, 5 doses next week. . will be busy and scanned every 8 weeks. Also started pain medication as I had so many days in a row with little sleep due to horrible facial and neck swelling. 1 day now and such a relief! hope everyone has a good weekend, J ",

She was trying to prevent me from hearing secondhand about her health. We laughed but when my cancer came back I similarly fell to bits. Itold some and not others. Just do what feels right . I've usually also expressed how awkward/painful/tentative etc I've felt. The ones who were hurt did so because they had wanted to help from the start- no issue once they understood how we were still trying to cope. I recently spoke with my dad about hiw our telephone calls were becoming trite as I was only telling good news.. We keep learning.. BarbDenise, I had a consult with an anesthesiologist for a surgery, and he asked me \"why not let nature take its course if I had stage 4 and stop everything\"?!?? He was disciplined by the hospital. :) I have neck lymph node Mets and mets on/in my lungs (& elsewhere), and no one is certain what explains my cough- strctural blockage on my airway, vocal chords being pressed, fluid/mets in lungs - or a combination- but codeine pills control it. I do know there are many options for chemo - I too love having my list. I got it after my (somewhat yucky) ONC made a point of stressing how I needed already 3 recipes in 12 months in terms of hope for the future. My clinical trial failed for me after 4 weeks: a liver met went from 3.5cm to 8.3cm. Starting now CMF. Here's hoping! Good wishes everyone.",

I also agree with everyone that this board is so very important to me. I come read when I feel overwhelmed or hopeless and I find that the encouragement and the frank discussion of these horrific developments is calming. Knowing that others feel and experience similar issues is comforting. On Nov1 I will find out if CMF is doing anything for me. I am hopeful but I'm struggling with a cold and the efforts to breathe are scary - congestion? clots in my lungs? mets in my lung getting bigger or more? low blood cell counts 1 week post chemo? my cancerous neck lymph mets are more active? (I found out in the summer that my one lung had collapsed almost 70% b/c of accumulated fluids around it - a situation that thankfully resolved itself for now)..Breathlessness is likely explained by a combination of one or more of these factors.
