Around the time I noticed the dimpling a few weeks ago, I had missed 4 days of pills in a row, which caused me to have an early period because it messed up my hormones. My son was in the hospital, stressful time, which is why I missed the pills. Anyway, my hormones are still leveling out. Maybe this is a hormone issue too? I have a definite change of shape on the right side around the nipple, but its not a lump. More like just a puffy look to the areola on that side.  Sorry for the long post. ",

My original appointment had to be postponed because my doc was on maternity leave. Therefore I am no further along with answers as to what if anything is wrong. I was kind of hoping there was a way to post a pic here? I know that none of you can diagnose me. I totally understand and that isn't what I am looking for. However I think I have an indented area in the breast I am concerned with and I was hoping someone could tell me if it looks similar to what they experienced?  My symptoms have been breast swelling, shape changes, & pain. No redness or swelling. I am most concerned over the possible indented area though. Thanks to all. You're an amazing bunch.  Log in to post a reply",
