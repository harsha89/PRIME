I literally thought I might die of a heart attack waiting to find out. Please be encouraged that people with 4C ratings (like me) do often turn out to not be cancer. My nurse navigator was great in calming my fears and I really hope that you will have hope. I went for annual mammogram on 1/28, back for additional views on 2/6, biopsy of two masses (atypical and solid and irregular and all the scary stuff) on 2/13 and results were benign on 2/14. Sarbar22 was same, 4C was benign. Please have hope. There are lots of others on this site that post and are scared and then just stop posting. I assume they received good results and returned to normal life and forgot to post good results. Please have hope.",

I was called back for mammogram and they said I would need a biopsy on two irregular masses. I asked if it could be a cyst and she said no as it has \"no fluid\". The Dr seemed pretty convinced it would be cancer. She told me that she \"saw a surgery in my future\". She labeled it BIRAD 4C - \"high suspicion for malignancy\". I was worried sick. Literally sick, throwing up and not sleeping. I could not think of anything but this. When I bought milk, I would look at the date and think that I will be fighting cancer by then. It was all consuming. They were trying to get me an appointment with the breast surgeon before the biopsy results were back. I was certain it would be cancer. Biopsy came back benign for both spots. One was fiber something and other was a cyst. The nurse navigator later told me that my doctor was young (probably early 40s) and she was aggressive in terms of ordering biopsies and labeling them 4C. She said she felt it was better to label it 4C and have it be benign than label it 4A and have it be cancer. Nurse navigator said she gives out \"lots\" of benign results to people who are worried sick like I was and people with 4C. She said to remember that 80% of biopsies come back benign. While waiting for the results I had asked her if she felt that 80% benign applies to 4C and she said yes. I was where you are and I understand the panic you are experiencing. Please allow yourself to have some hope. Have some hope. You hold on to that 80% number and don't allow the devil to steal every bit of your hope. Pray. God hears you. Give this to God. I'm praying for you, girl. Even if you have to pray every 30 seconds then do it. Just pray for the Holy Spirit to pray for you. You don't have to pray anything else. Praying for you to be calm and have peace. 80% includes you!",

My best friend's niece has a website i think you should visit. http://christytibbets.simplesite.com Christy is young like you (34), with two boys and two girls and a full time job (preschool teacher). After the initial shock, she looked at her kids and said she has to kick cancer's ass and for them not to worry, because she is a big enough bitch to do it. She found out on a random Thursday this past November and had a double mastectomy on Monday. She has said that she's going to beat this and get it out of her life and she is doing it. She told her team that she wanted to go nuclear on this cancer and get rid of it once and for all. She is going at it with both barrels, take no prisoners. She is really inspirational and maybe in a few days you will get the strength to have some similar thoughts. I am sincerely sorry this is happening. I've been reading about all the dumb things people say when you tell them you have cancer and I hope this post doesn't wind up in that category. I'm writing up a prayer sheet right now for with-pity and my family will be praying big time. ",

      "Content": "Mar 1, 2019 12:34AM - edited Mar 1, 2019 02:47AM by Natasha007 Beep7bop, I had routine mammogram and was called back. Had Ultrasound and color Doppler. They found an irregular hypoechoic mass as well as a subtle irregular hypoechoic mass. Bi-Rad 4C high suspicion for malignancy. They did a spring loaded core needle biopsy on both places, taking about 8 samples. I had not mentally prepared myself for how many times in and out would occur with the biopsy. However, I'm the biopsy was super easy, I could go in for another today and not give it a second thought. I worked myself up that it would be awful and hurt and it was so easy and didn't hurt. I didn't want to be there but it was fine. I'm a classic over thinker and I worried way too much about the pain of the biopsy. Everything was benign, both masses. My nurse navigator said 4Cs come back benign often. She said Fibroadenomas mimic cancer and it is difficult to tell. Please don't assume the worst although I know that is hard. While waiting, I made myself sick with worry. Physically throwing up and sick. Not sleeping and weeping. I imagine that's normal but after I saw the 4C I just lost all hope. Try not to if you can. Call the breast center and speak with the nurse navigator. It really helped me. I also downloaded the calm app (blue cursive) and that helped. I prayed every 30 seconds in my head. Keeping my mind on God helped. I didn't have the strength or mental/emotional capacity to say meaning prayers so I just prayed for the Holy Spirit to pray for me. That's all I could muster. I'm so sorry you are going through this. I want to give you hope that even 4C can be benign. My nurse navigator said doctors have different reasons for labeling 4C and she told me to stay off google about it. Please see if you can speak to nurse navigator.    ",

You absolutely have to allow yourself to have a little hope. The odds are definitely in your favor at this point. Please consider calling your breast center and asking to speak with the nurse navigator. Your center should have one. Mine was so helpful and she gave me general information (not about my specific case) and after speaking with her, Ihad hope that I desperately needed. She also told me to download the calm app (blue cursive) and go through that several times a day. That helped. I also downloaded candy crush and made a goal to get through 20 levels a day. I also agree about Netflix. My Bi-Rad was 4C and turned out benign. Please have hope. I'm praying for you.",
