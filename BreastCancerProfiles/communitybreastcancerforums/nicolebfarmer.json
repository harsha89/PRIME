    "Content": "nicolebfarmer wrote: I have two grandmothers who have fought breast cancer. My paternal grandmother has been in remission and always had a very positive outlook. My maternal grandmother, with whom I am very close, just found out today that she has to have her remaining breast removed. She is very upset and I know feels as if she has been let down. I truly do not know what to say to her at this point to help her. Fortunately, I have never been there and feel that anything I say would be condescending. Do any of you know of any inspirational quotes or anything? I know that I should just tell her I love her and that I will be there for her whatever she needs. She's not exactly a \"touchy feely\" person anyway. What else can I do? Can any of you who have been there give me any advice on what to say/do? What helped everyone? Thank you so very much and best of luck to you all! Nicole Log in to post a reply",
