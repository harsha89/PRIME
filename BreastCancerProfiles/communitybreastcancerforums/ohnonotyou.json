I discovered swollen nodes in my neck (posterior cervical - both sides & the ones jsut above the collar bone) about 2-3 weeks ago, went to a walk-in clinic & got antibiotics. I ran out of antibiotics, and somewhere within that timeframe i notices swelling in my breasts (mostly the right) I am currently menstruating and probably have fibrocystic changes but i'm still so worried. My girlfriend says my nipples are always slightly retracted, but i never noticed, and everything just seems to be a symptom of everything. I got blood tests done at the ER earlier last night, and everything was normal & I have a middle ear infection in both ears, but i'm still so worried, and it's so hard to find reference pictures for people with smaller breasts. I have before & after pictures, one from around May, and nother from earlier tonight, and i was just looking for an opinion on whether or not it looks like i could have IBC? thank you, and i'm sorry in advance if these pictures could be considered explicit at all.
