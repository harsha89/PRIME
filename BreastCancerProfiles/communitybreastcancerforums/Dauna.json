      "Content": "Dauna wrote: So, I'm not exactly sure why in the past couple of days I've become really very worried about something I first discovered about eight months ago. I had IDC right breast diagnosed in June 2015. Stage 1c, grade 3, ER+, PR-, HER2- , oncotype test score 34 I had breast preservation surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. I was in a clinical trial and initially was lying on my stomach for radiation. It turned out to be diasterous. I broke two ribs during mapping. Immediate excrutiating pain was misdiagnosed. Began radiation two weeks later. Awful pain each time lying on my stomach five or six treatments later I broke more ribs and was hospitalized with what was thought to be a PE Eventually completed radiation March 2016 Fast forward to early 2017. I thought I noticed a thicken below my right breast on my rib cage but my breast had really changed (right breast is really very firm now and I'm 67) so I didn't give it a lot of thought and have mentioned it to no one. Now there is a much large and very distinct band of thickening under my breast across my rib cage. What's different now is that in certain positions I can feel it tugging and there is some intermittent stinging pain. Today I'm in tears about it but don't know if I should call my family Dr or my medical oncologist? I'm in such total denial that this is anything that when I saw a nurse practitioner three weeks ago I never mentioned it. I have t told anyone about this including my husband. I'm hoping that this is a common occurance 1-2 yrs post radiation and wonder if others have the same thick band of tissue? Thanks for reading my post and sharing any similar experience.

I try so very hard to never over react but I seem to reach a tipping point and have a mini melt down. I finally told my husband my fear. He acknowledges that he can both see and feel the thickening. He just said that tomorrow we'll call my medical oncologist. He's a tremendous source of strength for me. ",

I actually had to spend some 4 or 5 days in the hospital. I had been breathing so shallowly that my lungs were filling with fluid. A resperologist helped me to recover. When my radiation resumed I was placed on my back. Very best wishes Dauna",
