He is really afraid and bottles it up--I can see it--and sometimes it gets to be too much and he blows up and nothing is right. I ask if there is someone he can talk to (to vent) and he says there isn't. He doesn't want to go to support groups, or talk to his family or friends about it. I think he feels very isolated. Our friends and family will ask how I am doing, but they often don't ask how he is and that really bothers him. He thinks that I am doing too much and that I should take it easier, but I work and feel pretty good after my first chemo. He is a fixer and he cannot fix my cancer, so he feels helpless. He makes it up by doing as much as he can for me--until he gets exhausted. I am emotional at times and he came home a few days ago in the middle of the day to pick up some supplies and found me in tears--which doesn't help him much. He carries his cell phone everywhere (and actually has it on) just in case I get a fever, or something happens. cfdr, I am so sorry that you are having to deal with all of this while you are feeling so awful.",
