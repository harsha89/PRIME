My pain was subsiding, but today, after the placement of the SAVI, I'm hurting again. My BS did give another script for pain meds and I am using them. I will start with the radiation on Monday morning, for 5 days. There aren't many of us out there so I am happy to read or learn anything that you all can offer on the SAVI. I know we are fortunate to qualify for this kind of treatment, but since there's not a lot of talk about it on this forum, it's hard to know if what you're feeling is normal. Anyway, keep me posted on your healing, and I will do the same! Cheers!",

I am not sure if you have learned the details of your situation, but don't let \"rare\" frighten you! There are many rare types of BC which have favorable prognoses. Hang in there. You will get your information, and begin the journey. I was diagnosed in Feb, had my surgery March 23rd, had radiation....and am moving on. I remember the beginning....the shock, the surreal aspect of it all. The falling apart time....Things are better now and somehow, the trauma takes a back seat, as you learn and educate and take care of yourself. Remember, you are far from alone. This site has been a godsend to many of us. Please be proactive as you move forward. A nurse navigator is often offered to BC patients, someone you can call with questions . Take advantage of her for her wealth of resources. And remember....there are a lot of survivors out here. You can beat this!",

I am a 4 day survivor! :) I haven't posted for awhile, because my tumor type and choices have been a little different from most of the folks on this forum. At any rate, here goes. I had my lumpectomy 2 weeks ago today, (Mar 22). At that time, my BS put a spacer in the tumor cavity, in preparation for Brachytherapy. 3 days later, on Friday, after finding my margins were clear and my node was negative, (yay!) my BS put in a brachytherapy device: SAVI. The following Monday, last week, I began internal rads which lasted 5 days, 2x per day. I finished that treatment last Friday, April fools Day! They took the device out, and sent me on my merry way. As far as the experience, I felt it was a little rough, and there were days I felt it kicked my butt! My fatigue was overwhelming, but I realize that my emotional state could have played a part in that. Aside from that, I felt the device inside of my breast, and it did border between hurting , and just general pressure. I talked to others who were on the same timeline and treatment who were having an easier time than I was, I learned that the placement of my SAVI device was in an awkward position, which had to do with the location and whatever about my tumor, so maybe that's the reason I had a harder time. That being said, I am on the other side of it, and I got all the rads done in 5 days! I have no external burns and I am getting back into the groove of things. At this point, I just have a gauze bandage on the wound from the SAVI device, and I can stop that as soon as my minimal draining stops. My most troubling surgical effect is where they took out the sentinel node. It's still very tender and hurts quite a bit, at times....the surgery was only 2 weeks ago, so I realize that the node areas take a bit longer to heal. I have my first MO appointment this Friday. I don't know what he'll recommend, but it may be Hormone therapy. I have read different articles on the protocol of adjuvant treatment for my diagnosis and results, so we'll see. I know there are not many on this forum who have done the APBI (Brachytherapy) thing, but I thought I'd post it here. If anyone has the opportunity to do this type of rad, while I am not an expert, I would be happy to share my personal experience with you. All in all, even though it was not the easiest week, I would do it again, in a heartbeat. I feel fortunate that I was a candidate for this type of internal radiation, and if it is suggested to any of you reading this, feel free to email me, or ask me on this site. I will share this post on the Brachytherapy topic as well. Finally, to all of us, let's continue healing, stay strong and stay positive!",

I had my Lumpectomy on March 23 and finished the SAVI (5 days 2x per day) on April 1st, 2016. I have been having mild pain, and tenderness, but yesterday I spent a lot of the day icing the area. The pain felt more like it was around where the SAVI had been inserted, rather that the lumpectomy area....but both are tender. I have been working out a lot more so that might be part of it, but I'm glad to know that the pain is not abnormal.",
