      "Content": "Jun 23, 2011 01:21AM - edited Jun 23, 2011 01:29AM by elinruby By the way, I have taken mood meds and am not especially a fan, especially in cases like here where it seems like the genesis of the problem is not with you. Possibly you are wound a little tight though? Why do you care if he drinks vegetable drinks? Did I miss a step there?  Here's what I know to tell you about them, though, so you can decide for yourself. Most likely they will want to give you an SSRI such as Effexor because many doctors feel these drugs are less dangerous than some of the more addictive happy pills for example. If this works you will generally have a sunnier mood and more serene outlook. On the other hand it can take up to a month for this drug to take full effect. In some patients, and I was one, forgetting a dose or stopping the medicine can cause a wierd \"brain zap\" sensation that is rather disturbing, like an electric shock. It happens intermittently then gradually tapers off, but to me that's too much trouble for being a bit happy, especially if it takes a month to get there.   Anti-anxiety meds might help, or there is a drug called Wellbutrin that takes effect immediately and clears your system the same day. It's probably considered pretty safe; they use it to help people stop smoking anymore. If your doctor thinks not on the anti-anxiety meds, this might be  worth a try. Not for you if you have a history of seizures though; also it affects some people as a stimulant which you may think is a good thing , or not. At least you would find out quickly whether it is going to help.  Music or exercise may help if you have it in you. One hole in the road I wanted to point out -- I was reading the list of interactions and side effects for Taxol the other day, and I am pretty sure there was a warning not to take St John's Wort with it, that there is some sort of undesirable interaction. Thought I would mention that as quite a few people take it for mood and think it's harmless because it's a plant. It does interact with quite a few things, and so does Taxol. You might want to google taxol interactions as there may be classes of happy pills I am not recognizing in the list and if so that would potentially affect your choices hope this helps a little, the validation at least... ",

      "Content": "elinruby wrote: Please allow me to rant about this, as it has been driving me quietly crazy for months, and who knows, one of you ladies may have a key piece of information for me. I was diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer in Sept of 2010 after I wound up in the ER with excruciating back pain. I could not lie down at the time; that in and of itself was ok, but sitting up afterwards made me scream. The back had been getting steadily worse for about a month. I still remember the pitying look the nurse gave me when the doctor came in to tell me. I have a history of pulmonary embolism so they they had done a CAT scan, which found a lump in my breast and another in my spine. They admitted me and the next day did a mammogram and a needle biopsy, which confirmed the cancer. I had no insurance so their oncologist refused to treat me. But they kept me in the hospital for a couple of weeks trying to get the pain enough under control for me to function. I could not sleep much. The pain woke me up when I rolled over. To give credit where it is due, their social worker made me aware of the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment program. But the hospital I was in could not enroll me in it. I needed them to discharge me. Then I could get myself across town to the hospital that *could* sign me up. The BCCTP staff had moved elsewhere in the hospital complex, I found when I got to the hospital. New people worked there, for a different program. But I could barely walk and was in obvious pain, so they made arrangements to have the forms to come to me and sign me up where I was. So then I had medical coverage. I still had to get from the office building to the hospital itself. The ER was a couple of buildings away, but just then walking sent sharp pains down my spine. I did have to walk, though. I arrived in tears, with a blood pressure so high the triage nurse put me on her couch until a bed became available. So *that* hospital admitted me, also in an attempt to get the pain under control. The morphine the other hospital discharged me with did not begin to touch it. I could sit quietly but once the pillows slipped or I lay flat, for another CAT... shiver. It was very painful. Dark times. The PET scan was positive. The CAT indicated that a sliver of bone was impinging on my spine and I was sternly instructed to tell someone right away if I became incontinent or lost sensation in my legs, because surgery *might* work if it happened soon enough. Otherwise the paralysis would be permanent. Despite this, they discharged me, but I did make it to the appointments with the radiation oncologist. The friend who took me to the doctor's office told her that I'd been saying hey what's the point? If it just gets worse from here, why even do this? The radiation oncologist said well, we've been worried about over-sedating you, but sometimes undersedation is worse. She gave me a prescription for Dilaudid, which did work pretty well, and miraculously did not knock me out the way the morphine had. If anyone knows how that works, incidentally... that's one thing I wonder. The removal of pain changed the calculations a bit. I let my parents and my sister know about the diagnosis. They lived in other cities. I have to say, their grief was not helpful to me. But anyway. The radiation oncologist said, I really need to be sure that the lesion in your back is cancer. It probably is -- normally we don't see fractures like that in women in their fifties. And no, you are not going to be cured. We don't use the word cure once it spreads. But you could easily live for years. But not decades, I extrapolated. She hesitated and said nothing. So. She sent me for a spinal biopsy. I have no idea why they don't use a general anesthetic for this test... nothing like excruciating pain, while being told \"don't move, or you could be paralysed.\" It feels just like being stabbed, except that you can feel the needle scraping on bone. I had nightmares about this test for months. But here's the thing. The biopsy was negative. The tumor board was divided. The radiation oncologist thought I should have surgery to stabilize my spine but the neurosurgeon said that if I did not have cancer the surgery was too risky, as it required him to move my heart and my lungs before he even started. But he made it clear that he thought I *did* have cancer there. And he should know what cancer in the spine looks like, he said. At the tumor board the doctors apparently argued about this. The interventional radiologist rejected the idea that he somehow failed to detect cancer that was there, pointing to the multiple scans he did during procedure. They show the needle *right there,* the radiation oncologist told me. And the biopsy did find cells that were growing for some reason, accounting for the scan results....they just not cancerous. Nobody liked my theory that I hurt my back and it was healing. The interventional radiologist refused to repeat the biopsy. No additional benefit, as I understood it, because he believed his results. Lots of unnecessary pain for me was the risk, with a significant risk of further destabilizing the vertebrae, which the CAT scan report described as having a \"moth-eaten\" appearance. So the tumor board thought about me again and decided to send me back for a biopsy of a smaller area that also showed \"hot\" on the PET scan. This one was on the iliac crest. Taking a cell sample here literally required a screwdriver to be hammered into my pelvis. This biopsy was also negative.  Back to the tumor board. I told the radiation oncologist that if they really really wanted me to, I would have the biopsies again, but meanwhile, could we please deal with the cancer that we know that I had? I was worried about it spreading, even though I was on Tamoxifen while all this was going on. The tumor board decided to refer me for surgery. If you threw out the spine and the pelvis hot spots, I was a candidate for axial node dissection and a lumpectomy. I think the radiation oncologist went to bat for me. She told me I deserved the benefit of the doubt. I myself want any treatment that increases my chances. The surgeon did a really good job of explaining to me that mastectomy would not improve my odds, but said that she would perform one if that was what I chose. I elected a sentinel node biopsy and... 2 of 3 lymph nodes had micrometastases. Well.... apparently it's micro at 2mm or less. I had one that was less than 2 mm and one that was *at* 2mm. Apparently there is some controversy about whether this counts as metastasis. I have had two doctors tell me no. But one of the nodes with cancer in it was not the sentinel node. The surgeon was not able to explain this. She said she took that node out because she did not like the way it looked. But the idea of a sentinel node biopsy is that it identifies the lymph node that the cancer would go through to get to the rest of the body. If the cancer is in the lymph nodes this is significant for the staging, as I understand it. Except maybe it doesn't count under 2mm, apparently? On the other hand, if the cancer is in a lymph node that is *not* the sentinel node, then... how did it get there? Does this imply that it did not come from the primary tumor but from some distant site to which it has already spread? The surgeon did not have an answer to that. But what she did know, she said, was that if the cancer had already spread beyond the lymph nodes, there was as little point in removing them as there would be in removing them if the cancer had not reached them yet.  So it is still unclear whether the stage is IIB or IV. Meanwhile, the neurosurgeon and the medical oncologist (who had prescribed the Tamoxifen and switched me to Fentanyl for a further improvement in pain control) both still thought I had stage IV breast cancer. Somewhere in here, the bone shard that was pressing on my spinal cord shifted, or shrank, or....something. And suddenly pain was not the primary factor in my life. The margins of the biopsy were not clear so I had to have a second surgery. The surgeon infomed me that in her opinion I was at very high risk for lymphedema and that while removing the lymph nodes was still the standard of care, this would probably change. I asked her for her own personal opinion, which was that the benefit to me of removing them would be zero. Because of this, the surgeon *also* presented my case to the tumor board, and it was again divided. I asked for a week to think about the available information. In that week ASCO announced a study came out saying pretty much the same thing the surgeon had. Exactly. So I decided against the lymph node removal, although I did elect to go back in for the DCIS at the margins. Then chemo. I had four treatments with Adriamycin and Cytoxin, two weeks apart. I am currently headed into my eighth of twelve weekly treatments with Taxol. Then I am scheduled for three months of daily radiation treatments. Somewhere in there we need to figure out if she will treat the breast, or the breast, the spine and the pelvis. Another CT scan is in my future, but... this gave us a false positive before. The thinking seems to be that if the spinal lesion responds to chemo, then the cancer must be stage IV.  But... the spine was better *before* we started chemo. I am really afraid that this means another biopsy or two. But much as I dread that idea, another biopsy might avert zapping healthy bone tissue. If healthy bone tissue is what it is. Argh.  I would appreciate any thoughts. Possibly helpful data: grade 1, estrogen positive. Primary tumor \"kinda big\" at 3.5cm. I am 54, with a history of precancerous findings on PAP smear (treated with cryosurgery) and colonoscopy (polyps removed during procedure). Both findings came before these tests are normally done, but I had had symptoms. BRAC status unknown, but no family history of breast cancer. An aunt had ovarian cancer and died. So far I have shortness of breath and pain in hands and feet, but am coping well enough to continue chemotherapy. I have a rather, um, full, medical history, but I guess my health is fairly good. I tend to get better rather than spiraling into infirmity. I'm told my treatment regimen is \"aggressive\" and I am ok with that if it is likely to help. I am being treated at a county hospital, but the county is Santa Clara in California and most of the doctors are affiliated with Stanford, so I don't worry about getting the right care, although I do not have a good feel for whether it is conservative or cutting-edge or middle-of-the-road. I *have* noted that I'm getting some new and expensive palliatives for side effects -- shots for white blood cell production and new anti-nausea medications.

If she is and sleeps a lot, then perhaps another pain medication could help. I was taking morphine and really didn't want to do anything but sleep. They hesitated to switch me because I seemed over-sedated, but it really wasn't doing anything for the pain either so they tried Dilaudid and it worked. No nausea, no drugged-out feeling, much better pain control. The problem there was that it only lasted about four hours so I wanted to take half the dose every two hours so I wouldn't be in and out of pain all the time. They switched me instead to a Fentanyl patch which is slow-release, with the Dilaudid as backup.",
