How long was your surgery? are you able to move around the house now or take a shower and take care of yourself?  You are an independent courageous woman.  I do not want to burden my body with extra surgeries or future complications.  do you think you will plan for new wardrobe? most of clothes i have now are quite tight fitting.. I am thinking that if i choose no recon, i will start wearing big loose clothes since I do not fancy wearing those falsies.  How many inches are your scars?  I sure hope that you are recovering well and send a note to let us know when you can!",

Well, i have always been 90% sure about having no reconstuction because i do not like the multiple surgeries. complications or possible infections and with chemo making my body a little compromised, i want the simplest and quickest healing surgery there is! ;)  Can you share some of your thoughts on this where you based your decision on?  The biggest hesitation I have is on the prophylactic breast removal, I go through it many times in my mind during a course of day, the pros and cons of each side...  Of course getting it removed means more recovery time, more trauma to the body and in Chines energetic medicine, it also blocks the energy (chi) flow of the body and then there is the worry about aesthetics and considerations for finding a partner - I am single 45 year old; but then on the other hand, the worries and concerns that will linger and stay with that breast down the road especially with our type of TNBC diagnosis.  Not to mention the 6 month interval of mammograms, the trepidation and radiation that go along with that.   And the many stories of it going to the other breast from our other BC sisters.   Can i ask if you had the BRACA gene test and what the results are?  Mine are negative.   I would truly appreciate if you could share some of your thought processes regarding this decision that you are so happy with.  I want to be happy with whatever decision i make and never live in regrets anymore.  Just like Louise Hay says, my new life will start on this year of 2014 and after i get the PCR and life will go on with passion ",

Thank you all. take care",
