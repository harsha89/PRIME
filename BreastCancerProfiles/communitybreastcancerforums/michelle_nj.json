The pathology report shows multiple tumors LCIS and ILC, classical type, with biggest ILC 3cm. I also had false negative sentinel lymph node dissection (about 30 positive cells) followed by level one and two axillary nodes dissection , with 18 nodes, all negative. I'm 49 yo. Currently I'm in chemo, just finished ACx4, biweekly and will be getting Taxolx4 biweekly too. I have an appt with the radiation oncologist next month to see if I really need radiations as my oncologist thinks I\u2018m in the gray area. Please help me understand if radiation is necessary in my case. I'm also very interested in your opinions, experiences. Thank you very much for your help! Dx 10/26/2009, ILC, 3cm, Stage II, 1/22 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
