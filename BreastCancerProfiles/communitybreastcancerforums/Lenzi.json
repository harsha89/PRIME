And while yours may be named \"aggressive,\" doesn't mean it automatically a death sentence...cancer is far more seen now as a \"chronic illness.\" If you're a research fan, check out reliable sites such as MD Anderson or the Mayo Clinic. Create a list of questions for your medical team. Be sure to get support fm your family and friends, perhaps have dad take the kids more so you may be able to focus a bit more on you. Don't be afraid/worried about asking for help (I'm not great at it...many of us women are so used to managing everything ourselves!) Try not to go to \"worse case\" scenario. ‚ù§",
