I had an MRI Friday and should hear back from that, today. They didn't take a blood smear from me, either. I figure a bleeding nipple must be caused by something. Hopefully, something real simple, but something none the less. You should probably ask for MRI for your own peace of mind. I hope you find answers. Please keep me posted. Prayers your way!",

My mother was diagnosed with DCIS in her early 50's, and my maternal aunt was diagnosed with IDC in her early 60's. 2 years ago, some left breast calcifications were noted on my yearly mammogram. After a follow up mammogram, we needle biopsied.  All calcifications were removed and life returned to normal. Mammogram 9 months ago was clear.  Last Friday, I woke up and had blood on my pajama top, over my left nipple.  I gently squeezed my nipple to see if that is where it came from, and it was.  It wasn't bright red, but obviously bloody. I briefly freaked out, called my husband, then called my GYN.  I was seen by my GYN that afternoon.  She made an appt with the surgeon for Tuesday of the following week, and mammo/ultrasound for Wednesday.  I saw the surgeon who called the breast center and asked them to add a Ductogram to my already schedule appt. The surgeon was mostly concerned because of the previous biopsy, and the maternal BC history.  I had mammo/ultrasound on Wednesday, those tests were clear, but the radiologist didn't want to do the ductogram.  He called the surgeon (as he sat in room with me) and asked if we could do an MRI as the next step.  The surgeon said this was fine as next step and I heard him say that he was espicially concerned because of the history. I asked the radiologist, \"If the MRI doesn't give us a diagnosis, and the bloody discharge continues, do I just assume this is normal for me?\". He said, \"yes\". When I mentioned this to the nurse, she said, \"No, you have to keep digging until we figure this out.\". I haven't had anymore spontaneous bleeding, only when gently squeezed  (which I don't do often). I will have the MRI next week, pending insurance approval.  Has anyone else had a situation, like mine? Log in to post a reply",
