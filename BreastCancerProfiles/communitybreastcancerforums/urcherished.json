    "Content": "urcherished wrote: I had my 1st mammogram this past May...and was called back because of an abnormal finding. At that time, I had another mammogram that was a little bit more films taken than the first one. The same day was scheduled for an Ultrasound. The results were that I had a complex cyst .7 by .6 centimeters. Catagory 3...probably benign finding...and was told I needed to go back in 6 months for another ultrasound. Today I saw my OBGYN for a check up and she looked at the mammogram report and told me she would like for me to see a surgeon just to be on the safe side, but for me not to be alarmed, this is mainly for a second opinion. I am scheduled to see the surgeon Tuesday.  Am I being worried about nothing. But I did do some research on complex cysts in the breast and was a little alarmed to find out most all complex cysts will turn into cancer.  That worries me because the radiologists did not seem to be very concerned if he wants me to wait 6 months for another ultrasound.  can anyone help me understand it all?
