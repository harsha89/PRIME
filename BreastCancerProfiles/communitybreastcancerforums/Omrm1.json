I used the full tube and it only made it worse, so I returned to my doctors and they told me to just use another tube of the cream. After using two tubes of E45, my nipples have really bad cracked skin and the skin just flakes off, causing them to bleed even more. I often get sharp pains in both breasts but everything is worse on my right breast including the soreness and bleeding. I've also found lumps on my armpit and  usually have 2-3 each time on both armpits. I told my doctors about those lumps and they told me that they were from shaving my armpits and told me to stop shaving them but the lumps did not go. I haven't found any lumps in my breasts, but I've only just turned 17 so I'm really worried as I don't think my doctors are taking this seriously, it's causing me a lot of pain and discomfort and I can't really bare it any more. Any advice?  Log in to post a reply",
