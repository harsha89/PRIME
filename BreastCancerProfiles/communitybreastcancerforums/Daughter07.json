She is 67yr old diabetic and recently had a breast ultrasound and the result came with BIRADS CATEGORY 4 RIGHT BREAST SOLID NODULE WITH LOBULATED AND SLIGHTLY ANGULAR MARGINS She's about to do biopsy nxt week and i have read alot in google that this result doesn't sound good. Can anyone please enlighten me? Coz ive been crying for days now. Is this cancer? And what should we do next? I also wanted to know if its 4a, 4b or 4c? Thank you. There is no history of breast cancer in the family but there are some men in the clan who died in different kinds of cancer: lung cancer, leukemia, and cancer in the nose.",
