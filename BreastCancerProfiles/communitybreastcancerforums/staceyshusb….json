I think we're more likely to go without the scans now, but I will discuss further with the oncologist this week. Its strange too, my wife's plastic surgeon had no problem with the tissue expanders in during radiation. He just said we must wait at least six months after the end of radiation so the skin can heal. Then the implants go in. The radiation oncologist has no problem with the expanders in as well.",
