I don't have any big questions to prompt a thread, but I'd like to chat with other high risk folks. Case in point, my friends are all posting festive family photos online for Thanksgiving, but I'm home researching breast reconstruction and reading these forums. Even if I was with family right now, I'd probably bring everyone down by talking about genetic mutations. BRCA+ life is weird like that. Log in to post a reply",
