My husband suggested driving to the ocean for the day tomorrow, just to get out of town with the kids and fish/walk/maybe swim, etc. I met with the radiologist today and we decided to take a wait-and-see approach for the nodule, as I'm still breastfeeding and he believes there is very little risk of it being cancerous. Not sure about where to go from here, if anywhere. Maybe just take a wait-and-see approach with the breast...I'm just having a hard time getting the stories out of my head wherein women had a bruise for months, or a red spot, with few other symptoms, only to find out that they did indeed have IBC. Or all of the stories where punch biopsies came back negative, and on and on. It's just doing a number on my anxiety. Will definitely continue addressing my mental state. Thanks, everybody, again, for such thoughtful replies. I will continue to check in, and I'll update, if need be.",

I saw a GP yesterday afternoon and was prescribed 25mg of Zoloft; took my first dose last night. I'm a bit scared about side effects, having never taken anything before, but know I need help and that it isn't logical to ruminate on worst-case scenarios all day and all night, even if I am dealing with something shitty. I'm in San Antonio, TX, and saw a renowned breast specialist yesterday morning, also a breast cancer survivor -- founder of Aurora Breast Center. (I can't afford to go to MD Anderson, or I would.) Said she has seen IBC throughout the course of her long career. Brought over my images, etc. She spent maybe 5 minutes with me, hugged me, and told me to enjoy my baby. After just a quick glance, she said, you do not have IBC, please move on. My husband and I pushed for an MRI, but she said no way. It'd be a waste of time and money. I'm inclined to believe her, and I did for a few hours, yet everything you read online (I swore off of stories on the internet a few days ago) mentions people getting turned down for tests and brushed off by doctors routinely, and then it's too late for treatment. And that the symptoms are so subtle and sneaky, etc. But anyhow, I tried to go to bed last night repeating the mantra \"enjoy your baby\"...worked okay. But this morning I got an email from the founder of IBC Research Foundation -- I'd reached out to her after being warned about IBC from lactation consultants -- and she said the only way to rule it out is to push for an MRI. Of course, that freaked me out, because I'd recently resolved NOT to push for any more tests for the time being, and see how things go. I just feel like I can't use a lot more energy (financial or emotional) trying to find other doctors to give me the tests I want (an MRI), and I'm having a difficult time discerning if I'm being cautious and wise or paranoid and grim. Can I ask if either of your peau d'orange symptoms were somewhat subtle? (Not like the very, very obvious pictures on the internet.) The hair follicles on my left breast are more obvious than on my right, kind of like a strawberry, those tiny little pits. But in certain lights this isn't very noticeable. My husband will finally agree that they are more pronounced, but says it's too subtle and has always been like that. The one without the obvious hair follicles is a bit saggier, thinner skin, and has some scarring from having a large mole excised from it years ago. There's a picture on this site of someone's hair follicles, asking if it was the orange peel symptom. I don't know if you all have seen that group of pictures; they're fairly old and I don't think the OP ever came back to say what was up, but mine look like that in one breast, yet are not very visible on the other. I don't think it's always been this way -- I think it happened just a week ago -- but of course I've not looked closely 'til now. Kicks, thanks so much for sharing your symptoms, and Scwilly, thanks for the advice about not fearing time passing. I know if it is IBC it will get worse, that something else will happen that would probably be a bit more obvious. Not sure if I should put this away for awhile, or continue to try to get an MRI. What do you all think? How does one even go about getting an MRI if doctors don't deem them necessary? I will have a core biopsy of the hypo echoic thing this afternoon...and I will continue to update to let you all know how things go. Thank you greatly for the support and replies.",

      "Content": "PinkMotel wrote: Hi. So, I've never joined a forum of any kind but have lurked plenty...and my current medical situation is prompting me to seek more specific support. I am 33, just gave birth 9 weeks ago to my 4th baby. I have breastfed all of my children 'til at least two or three years of age, never dealt with mastitis or low supply issues; in fact, if anything, I dealt with \"oversupply.\" This time around, at one week postpartum, I developed what I considered to be run of the mill mastitis: a deep red silver dollar sized painful spot on the top of my left breast, accompanied with a high fever (102-103) and chills. I took antibiotics and felt better after about 48 hours, though the red spot \"healed\" into a shadowy, dusky bruise that has remained for the past 7-8 weeks. I didn't think much about the shadowy bruise, but did get mastitis another time about 2 weeks later, same breast, but underneath instead of on top. I was hit hard by fever and chills again, used cabbage leaves and poke root instead of antibiotics at the advice of some knowledgable friends, rested for a few days while nursing up a storm, and felt good as new. It should be noted: both times I had mastitis, my new baby had slept 4 or 5 hours instead of the usual 1 or 2. (She's a great night sleeper, and I have to kinda wake her up and bother her if I don't want to feel terribly engorged.) So logically, of course, I never considered cancer. Fever/missed feedings = mastitis. Two weeks ago (about 3 weeks after the last round of mastitis) I woke up in the morning not to both breasts pretty engorged, as usual, but to one breast engorged (my right) and the left (the one previously afflicted with the mastitis) shrunken to a b cup instead of the d it had been the day before. I was shocked and confused, felt something wasn't right. I have pictures, but assume I can't post them. My milk supply literally \"dried up\" overnight. I can still get a bit of milk, but my breast is actually shrunken, compared to the other, and will not fill up or \"let down.\" I have recently, over the past few days, secured an electric pump from a friend in the hopes of getting the milk supply going again in that breast. I saw my midwife, who in 25 yrs. has never seen this. She sent me to two very experienced lactation consultants who seemed very concerned and also say they've never seen anything like it. They mentioned IBC (because of the faint bruising) and referred me to a general surgeon with experience in breast pathology. Of course, due to reading about IBC, I have been in a state of panic and shock for 2 weeks. I saw the general surgeon promptly and he wasn't too helpful. Said sometimes bruises from mastitis are permanent, and sometimes one breast will dry up because of exhaustion. (??) He also called the bruise a \"perceived bruise,\" as it is rather shadowy and faded and ill-defined, at the convergence of two veins. (Approximately 4cm by 3cm.) He said there is no way I have IBC, because it must present as red, infected, and enlarged. I did push for imaging, so I had an ultrasound and mammogram done. Breasts too dense for mammo, but ultrasound showed a hypo echoic mass (bi rads 3) right near the shadowy \"bruise\". Surgeon said to come back in 6 months for followup. I went back a few days later and took my husband - we explained our concerns about the bruising. He said he could promise me, as someone who \"does this for a living\", that I do not have IBC. He admitted he does not have a lot of experience with lactating breasts, so he wouldn't be able to give me answers regarding decrease in size and milk supply, and he couldn't explain the discoloration. But he was adamant that it was not IBC. We pushed him to do a small punch biopsy of the area, anyway, and he did. (I was bummed to find he did it about 1 cm outside the perimeter of the bruise, but it was no fault of his...the borders are ill-defined, as I mentioned, and I think he was trying to stay away from the veins.) Got the call today that the punch biopsy was negative, and he said if I liked, he could do a core biopsy of the hypo echoic thing this Friday (in two days), but that he knows that will be benign, as well. So, I'm not insured and am nearly broke due to just having a baby (I am freelance so I don't get paid leave) and paying for all these appts and procedures during the postpartum period. In order to have the biopsy done, or to see a breast specialist (as I feel I need), we will have to borrow money from close friends, and/or wait until I can get some work lined up. I'm not sleeping, and because of the internet, am convinced I have IBC. The dusky bruise combined with the drastic shrinking overnight and loss of milk supply is freaking me out. Do I trust this doctor (and punch biopsy) and move along with life, or keep pushing? I have no idea if I can trust my gut because I do have a history of health anxiety AND postpartum depression/anxiety. This is a really hard, emotional time for me and feels like a nightmare, even if, right now, it's only in my own head. I'm crying often, not eating, not sleeping, shaking, trying to keep it together. My husband is very supportive but really doesn't think the bruising is anything, because it is faint and isn't large, and hasn't really changed in almost 2 months. I think the hair follicles are more enlarged and defined on that breast, like little pinpricks, but my husband thinks I'm crazy when I point that out and says he sees those on the other breast as well. I'm also feeling burning under the armpit and enlarged lymph nodes on my shoulder and lower neck on that side, but once again, I have history of health anxiety and my husband (and the doctor) say they can't feel the lymph nodes. I'm just sick with fear and don't know who to trust or how to move forward. I want to be here for my 4 kids and this whole thing just feels like an absolute nightmare...I can't help but imagine the worst. I'm up all night with worry and diarrhea and trembling, just straight-up panic and morbid, dark thoughts. I am looking into zoloft or lexipro; I've never taken meds for anxiety but know I can't go on like this. Thanks for reading, if anyone made it this far. I would appreciate advice or insight so, so much. Feel like I'm flailing here, and that the doctor (and maybe my husband) think I'm a bit paranoid and crazy. Much love and respect to all of those battling this. Log in to post a reply",

I wish you well in your continued treatment. I'm working on my postpartum anxiety, but I'll admit, it is really, really difficult. There are so many stories of women being misdiagnosed on the internet, and I just can't tell when enough is enough, you know? I do notice changes in my breast, but to the two doctors I've seen, they are not concerning. It's hard to rest in that, especially when the changes seem associated with such an aggressive cancer, but I am trying. Again, Sarah, thank you for your encouraging words, and for taking the time to respond so compassionately.  Amy       ",
