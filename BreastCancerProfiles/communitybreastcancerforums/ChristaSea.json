      "Content": "ChristaSea wrote: I was diagnosed almost two months ago and start chemo (TCHP) next week. Today I had an ultrasound biopsy of my armpit because the breast MRI gave them some concerns. So here's the freaky thing: one of my lymph nodes is enlarged to 4 cm. That's almost twice the size of my breast tumor! What the heck?! Also, when I asked if there were other suspicious lymph nodes the tech said, \"a handful\" and then another tech said \"3 or 4\" Why can't anyone just give me a straight answer? I can't find (or am searching in the wrong place for) info on ginormous lymph nodes. I'm waiting on pathology (the radiologist only biopsied the huge one and admitted that if it had cancer in it we'd assume the other suspicious nodes did too.) What is my question? Has anyone had this? Am I a freak of nature? I already know I have cancer, why is THIS making me lose it? Thank you.

My diagnosis is so fresh (March 10) that my head is spinning and I don't know the secret passwords or handshake yet. I haven't cried, but am afraid I will break down when we talk to the little one and that's not good. Thanks so much for the support and stories and resources <",
