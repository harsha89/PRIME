When do you eventually hear it\u2019s no longer necessary to follow up. I am 27. I felt a marble like mass on my left breast in June. I had an ultrasound then. Then a follow up in November. They noted on that follow up to follow up again in 6 months. I just begin to wonder if I should be requesting a mammagram or biopsy or continue to trust in the care I have received. Thank you all for taking the time to read. I actually felt at ease at waiting again until a 27 year old coworker was diagnosed this week. But I imagine she had a different ultrasound reading which fast tracked her to needing biopsy etc. Some days it feels better to stay off the internet. June 2017 Ultrasound Report History: 27-year-old female with a probable abnormality left breast. Comparison: None. Technique: Realtime ultrasound examination of the left breast targeted to the palpable abnormality. Findings: At the 5:00 position, 4 cm from the nipple and corresponding to the palpable abnormality there is a 1.8 cm x 0.5 cm x 1.9 cm ovoid homogeneous mildly hypoechoic mass which is parallel to the skin and orientation and does not demonstrate acoustic shadowing and shows through transmission of sound. There is no internal vascularity by color Doppler evaluation. This is most likely consistent with a benign fibroadenoma. Impression: Probably benign fibroadenoma of the left breast. Follow-up ultrasound in 6 months may be recommended. Final overall assessment: BI-RADS Category 3: Probably benign. November 2017 Ultrasound Report History: Follow-up for left breast mass Comparison: 6/1/2017 Technique: Limited ultrasound scan of the left breast was obtained. Findings: There is a superficial elongated homogeneous mass at the 5:00 position measuring 1.7 x 0.5 x 1.8 cm. This measured 1.8 x 0.5 x 1.9 cm on the prior exam. Impression: Stable Benign-appearing mass in the left breast. Ultrasound BI-RADS 3 ; six-month follow-up exam is recommended Log in to post a reply",
