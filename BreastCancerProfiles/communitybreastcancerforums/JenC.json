I have had a few set backs with stitch abses, etc so I dont start Taxol until July 29th weekly x 12.  I have an appiontment with the radiation onc. on August 25th.  My regular onc said he \"does not think\" that I will have to have rads but not sure.  How is it determined if you need rads or not.  I know I will not be done chemo for a few months but I just want to know what is next.  Does the radiation onc decide if you have rads or is it the regular onc or are there?   Thank you ladies.  Hope you all have a great day.",

My hair just kept comming out by the hand fulls and the long strands were devistating to see. I went to the hair dresser on Friday and had it shaved off to a stubble. I thought that would be more traumatic than it was but it was not that bad. Actually once it was done I felt better. I still have little stubble that falls out but that is nothing compared to seeing the handfulls. I will get through this. Keep your chin up:) I have my second round of AC tomorrow and I asked my Onc to schedule me a consult with the radiologist to see if I have to go that route after Chemo and they arent scheduling consults for August yet??? Baffles me. This may sound like a stupid question but does everyone have to have radiation after chemo or does it depend on the pathology report. I had good clear margins with the mastectomy so not sure if I have radiation what they will radiate since there is nothing there???? Just wondering if that is the usual course or if some people dont have it.",

My son asked about cemeteries, what is under the \"domes\", how people get there, etc. and this was before I was diagnosed so it might just be a stage. I actually took my son to a cemetary so he could see that they were just headstones and that when people die they are put in the ground with a stone so that anyone who wants to can go and find their name on the stone and talk to them. Even though the person will not talk back they will still hear them. I really did not know what else to say to him but it sounded good:) Best of luck.",
