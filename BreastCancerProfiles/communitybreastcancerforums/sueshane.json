I remember getting my biopsy and really thought I might get bad news.  It was Labor Day weekend, so I was unlucky enough to have to wait one more day until Tuesday morning when I got the CA news.  If I had been a basket case that weekend, it would have been a very stressful and long weekend.  Instead, I went about my business until I needed to go into high gear with treatment options. If you are dx with cancer, find the best surgeon and oncologist in your area.  Best of luck to you,  Susan",
