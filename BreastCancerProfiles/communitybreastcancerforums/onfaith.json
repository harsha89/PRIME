      "Content": "onfaith wrote: 3 months ago I began having a strange dull ache in the lower portion inside of my left breast, say 7 and 8 o'clock. If pressed upon it would hurt, otherwise it was just a dull ache. Persistent through the months. At first, I payed little attention assuming that it was related to my cycle, but it didn't come and go with them. I do not feel a lump. That area feels a bit harder to me than the other side same place, but no lump. Still I scheduled a breast exam and mammo. Began thinking maybe I was having a Hypothyroid problem because I've gained weight, not normal for me, been incredibly fatigued and moody, also not normal at all. I eat well really well and am relatively active and have noticed that I tire so much easier than even just a few months ago and my hair is noticeably thinning. My labs for thyroid came back perfectly normal and my PCP just said it must be age. My GYN said everything felt normal and she diagnosed me with costochondritis ... which this doesn't feel at all like. Mentioning that any \"problem\" isn't typically painful. Prior to the Mammo, two weeks after my exam I had a similar dull ache in my left armpit, in the middle of it, inside near breast tissue. First Mammo came back with a spot on my left breast that they wanted to verify because this would be my baseline Mammo, I'm 43 and had just put it off. They scheduled a second mam and said that my breast tissue is dense, but there was nothing. The doctor in the scan office stated I was good for another year and that all my symptoms were nothing. Get home to receive a call from the GYN whose office told me they would prefer an MRI and I explained that I had just had my second Mammogram and needed to know what they wanted me to do. They said they'd call back by day's end, but that if the breast physician was fine with no MRI, well then \"they would be too\" and did not call back ... what the heck. I will follow up with them next week, but I'm more than a little confused. There is no history of breast cancer in my family. I am sure that it likely is nothing, but when do you push for more testing. Tonight my armpit is really sore and my nipple seems a trite tender. I have never not been healthy, outside of pregnancy complications, the epitome of health, so I am stumped and just not sure what to do with this. I just don't feel well. Have any of you, prior to diagnosis suffered any symptoms such as these, and should I even consider pushing this? Thoughts appreciated. Really confused. Thanks! Log in to post a reply",

That didn't even occur to me, nor had it been mentioned by either of my doctors, but makes complete sense. Neither of my sisters, both older, have gone through this, but both have autoimmune disorders so symptoms could be masked into those. Definitely something worth looking into. I will check into insurance. If not approved, I'll just wait until next year, but will follow up. it is likely absolutely nothing, but my breast and arm pit aren't sore, it's just a steady ache that comes and goes throughout a day and it's only the left, but again, I totally get it, hormones have a lovely way of wreaking havoc on our bodies. You guys have really helped settle some questions I had, thank you so much for taking the time.",
