    "Content": "AnxiousHubby wrote: My wife noticed tenderness in her breast two weeks ago and made an appointment with her OB/GYN.  They told her it was likely a benign cyst and said she could arrange to have it drained.  They did a mammogram to get a picture of it and the technician told my wife (after my wife insisted) that it was a probable malignancy that also appeared to be affecting her lymph nodes.  They sent her in for a biopsy the next day where they took samples from her breast and under her arm.  According to my wife they did a less painful mammogram this time and used some sort of visual device to guide the needle (ultrasound maybe?) to collect tissue samples.  We got the results back and everything was negative which is good.  They diagnosed her with acute mastitis and she is on cipro for ten days.  Why am I still concerned?  She definitly has an inverted nipple, and there is a visible pinkish bruise on her breast.  She also is complaining of itching of her breast.  We are on day four of antibiotics.  Could this be IBC and a case of an inaccurate biopsy?
