(She was supposed to get 10 but had to stop the last one due to side effects). The radiologist said that she would have problems with her esophagus, such as swallowing and discomfort. Her pain has been terrible and she can swallow very little amounts at a time, and that still even causes pain. The doctor said people with radiation to the sternum dont get it THAT bad. She is worried that it will not get better. Do any of you have experince of radiation to this area, or know of someone who has? Should it begin to improve? She wants to get 1 more treatment... if only the pain would stop. Other than the esophagus problems, she has had no other pain issues lately (Including the cancer in the bones!) Ironically, the treatment is hurting her worse :(.  Thanks everyone. Log in to post a reply",

So she called her oncologist and they said she must be evaluated - so we are going to the ER soon. They are going to take MRI's and see if her lesion is pushing up on the spinal cord (I think)... Because they said it could get worse/permentant if it is related to the tumor on her spine.  Has anyone had an issue like this with a tumor by the spine? Is radiation good at fixing the problem?.... She dosen't wet herself during the day or anything so its not like its a constant loss of control or something, but the last time she had radiation was when she was first diagnosed a year ago and im wondering if radiation would fix this issue, if this is in fact a problem due to a tumor.  Have any of you have had a problem like this?

For the sternum specifically she had radiation there. It caused a few problems with swallowing because the esophagus is located right behind it, but that is pretty much all gone now. We too live in Chandler, what oncologist do you see? ",
