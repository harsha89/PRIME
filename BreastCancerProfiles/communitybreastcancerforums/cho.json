Getting that little baby out released a whole lot of stress. Now to find out what it was. My left arm is a little miserable right now but surely by tomorrow it will be okay. As far as the \"reliablity of the study\", cbl, with as many patients as they get the term \"study\" is used loosely and actually means it is studied about as much as a flash card would be studied. But discounting their terminology the radiologists that I have dealt with have not ever missed what was most important...and that includes hairline fractures with my kids to mammos with myself. They, so far, have zeroed in on the problems I've needed to deal with so my faith in radiologists is pretty good even though they seem to talk out of both sides of their mouth. Hope you are doing well after your surgery.",

The mammo everyone knows is not your choice of afternoon fun and so I thought the worst was over...but geeeeeeeeze...when she pressed that wand over that spot I had no idea....I knew my entire breast was tender but apparently it radiates from that one spot. The tech said the radiologist was on the phone with another doctor...I don't know if the conversation was my business, someone else's business, monkey business...I'm clueless. So I got dressed and went to the waiting room to hear his words of wisdom and all I got was \"the radiologist MAY recommend a biopsy.\" Hello. Something IS in there and it does need to leave me alone. Has anyone ever had something like this??",

I have read that pain doesn't usually accompany breast cancer, although I did read on another site that cancers are usually not round but more oval shaped. I wish they would cut straight to a biopsy. Looking at something isn't the same thing as having it right there under the microscope. My mother is a cancer survivor (uterine), her mother had bc and bone cancer. My half-sister died of cancer (cervical) at 30 and it really wasn't until I read the radiology report that (that had MY name on it) I thought hey, I'm not so special that I couldn't get this disease also. 48 and still a dummy! Thank you for your encouragement. Carla",
