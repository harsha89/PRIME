I still wait for my appointmt with the dermatologist to see if he could do a biopsy. I also went directly to the breast clinic in the hospital, but the receptionist told me as below: here breast clinic is a cancer center, if my mammography looks fine, then I can't be there I actually just want try to have a breast specialist for the consultation. I checked your previous post, it's sad to know you have the peget's result positive. I also saw you mentioned yours are perfectly normal but peeling often. what type of peeling you have, it's the huge part of skin or just minor dried skin? I noticed mine is dry as well now, still itchy and also sensitive, harder than the other, the color also lighter than the other thanks for the help.  ",

I will do that tomorrow morning in the clinic to see if have the same result as yours. for now,I'm just running over here and there to see could have a real specialist to check my situation. here in MTL, almost 99% only believe the image result, if it's negative, means nothing matters. I feel huge frustration as there are other pbs which also matters but won't show on the image. we all hope it may be us over thinking, but we need a proof to keep us peace mind, now I'm still searching for the help.

I will try to find another one sooner. can I insist on the biopsy or it depends on the dermatologist? I really don't want to apply the 4th cream on the nipple, these medication just make this part so sensitive. from the experience I saw the GPs here in MTL, they just concluded the breast cancer should always related to the lumps under, or there is nothing wrong. I have the impression since the paget disease is so rare, it seems not all the GP even hear about this disease... felt so discouraged. ",

I went to see the dermatologist yesterday, who has a very good reputation in MTL. he checked and said it doesn't look like paget's disease, he said my left nipple only a bit swollen which is caused by eczema, He prescribed another cortisone 0.1% cream to apply once per day if it itches. I knew I have to insist for biopsy, I didn't get a chance. if my situation doesn't get better in a wk, I will come back to see him and ask for a biopsy or I could change to see another dermatologist for a 2nd opinion.

      "Content": "mtl114 wrote: Good day everyone, I have some concerns about my left nipple and hope if someone could give some suggestions. I live in Montreal and I'm 39 years old. my left nipple starts to itch in early Jan. 2019 and I noticed a piece of dry skin peeling off from the nipple. I put some Avon eczema cream on it, but it won't stop itchy. and I also noticed yellow liquid discharge from that nipple and some left on the bra. so I went to the walking clinic to see the GP for the 1st time at end of Jan. 2019 the GP prescribed me two medications for 10 days : Hyderm 1% cream and Bactroban cream He also ordered ultrasound for the breast and mammography for me I put these two creams for 10 days, the itchiness in the nipple was getting better, then repeat itchy again. I went for two scans as well. since the itchiness in the left nipple doesn't getting better, also I want to know the results of imaging. so I came back to the clinic for the follow-ups. this time I saw another GP. She said had checked my image result and there is nothing wrong shown for the left breast. I talked with her for my concern for a rare type of nipple disease and asking whether I could see a breast specialist and for a biopsy. she concluded I only have the skin infection and prescribed me another antibiotic cream: Clotrimazole for a week. She didn't give me the referral for breast specialist but recommended me to see a dermatologist. Actually the antibiotic cream she prescribed doesn't help mush to stop itchiness. I contacted the dermatologist for the appointment in 3 wks, that's the fast appointment I could get. but for now, my left nipple continue to itchy, also notice the left nipple skin color becomes lighter than the right one, I also feel discomfort for the left breast I look through internet and have some concern regarding a type of nipple cancer disease called paget's disease in the nipple. I wish it's just me overthinking about my symptoms, but I really don't want to wait to have clinical symptom appears then going back to run the test, that maybe too late. my concern is since there is no tumor show on the image of ultrasound and mammography, the doctor won't let me go further. I would rather to have the breast specialist to have a look and I'm willing to do the biopsy just to be sure. Could someone provide some suggestions to help me thank you all in advance.

I saw 3 GP.s, none of them think it matters, only skin issue, even I show the paper I print out for paget's disease. I went to breast clinic but they refused to serve since the image is ok. I will check with a general surgeon next wk and will try to have the dermatologist appointment next wk as well btw, where could get appointment for breast specialist or breast surgon? thank you again for all your warm help ",
