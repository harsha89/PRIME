My oncologist advised the same and felt very comfortable with me not going on T as the side effects outweighed the benefits in my situation. I am in my second year of increased monitoring. Nothing is guaranteed, but I feel very secure with the increased monitoring and visits with my surgeon and oncologist. It is interesting that my surgeon had stronger opinions about T than my oncologist did",

So far so good on all my imaging. Since DX I have had two MRI\u2019s. My surgeon advised that the gladiolinim used for breast imaging is not as high as with other types of imaging. For now, I will continue until the 5 year mark. Definitely stinks for insurance purposes though. Our deductible is high so we basically pay out of pocket.",
