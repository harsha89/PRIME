I was diagnosed with triple negative in November, 2018 and just finished 5 months of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  It shrunk the tumor considerably, but I won't know how much is gone / left until later.  ",

I'm hoping that it will pick up a bit now that I'm done with chemo.   I have the beginnings of eyelashes and brows, but they too are snow white.  It's, um, interesting. I invested in a very nice real hair wig that I wore exactly once.  I'm more comfortable in hats and have quite a number of them!  I forgot my hat once.  Was dressed in my work skirt and silk blouse, make up applied, pantyhose and heals on, dangly earrings in.  Didn't realize I was bare headed until 15 minutes into my commute.  Thought about just continuing my drive, but decided that the world and I were not ready for that, so turned the car around, grabbed a hat and started out for work again.  I keep a hat in my computer bag now, just in case chemo brain starts again! Anyone use castor oil?  I just got some and apply it to my scalp morning and night.  Not sure if it regrows hair, but it feels nice and makes my goose down less itchy under my hats.  ",

I have a prescription for Ativan and I have used it upon occasion, but it's not something I made a part of my regular routine.  That said, I had two yesterday, which is unusual for me.  (I got a 20 pill prescription 5 months ago and have 15 pills left.  Well, 13 after yesterday.) Yep - my pre-chemo anxiety is definitely peaking this week!  Only two more to get through.  Perhaps I accept this is short term and just roll with it.  A friend helped me download a guided meditation app.  Maybe I'll give that a shot.   ",

Just got back from meeting with my MO, post chemo.  I told him that when I met with the SO earlier this week, the surgeon thought the felt something left in my breast and that he observed that my nipple, which was inverted 6 months ago, is still a little off compared to my healthy breast. This triggered my MO to be extra diligent in the exam.  A month ago he told me he could not see or feel anything suspicious.  After the exam he doubled down and reasserted that he felt nothing.  Mind you, I've got an MRI and ultrasound next week so we will have more data later.  Anyhoo, now I'm thinking a small lumpectomy and breast conserving surgery is back on the table - yay me! But no, there's a twist.  At the beginning of the process I tested positive for the CHEK2 gene, which was listed as having an \"undetermined significance\" on the potential of developing breast cancer.  Since then he's done a bunch of research and while CHEK2 is not BRACA by any stretch, he recommended I seriously consider a prophylactic bilateral mastectomy.   BMX is where my head was at 6 months ago and I gradually came around to the idea of a lumpectomy.  Now I have some additional thinking and research to do.  I'm think I'm OK with the idea.  Just need to let it roll around in my brain for a bit.  ",

I've just come to accept that the next 5 weeks is just going to be a slog.  Everything I've heard, read, and researched tells me that the side effects, exhaustion, and general yuckiness gets progressively worse and that's just how it is.  Maybe if I expect the worst, I'll be less likely to be disappointed and maybe even pleasantly surprised on occasion.",

No matter the treatment plan we are \"lucky\" enough to have, everyone starts with diagnosis day, and whether you \"escape\" chemo, or a mastectomy, you don't escape that one day, that one conversation.  As horrible as this sounds, however, it unites us.  We understand each other in a way few will be able to at a gut level.

Mind you, I need to strip the sheets and blankets from the bed because they're soaked and gross.  And I've literally lost the whole weekend recovering.  But my good days are better than they were on A/C by a long shot.  I can work (productively, even!) socialize, focus, read, and enjoy life in a way I couldn't manage on A/C.  I guess the chemo gods giveth and the chemo gods taketh away. Only 8 left - that's my mantra.  I can get through 8 more of these.  ",

No fever, sore throat, or cough.  My MO thinks it could be related to recovering blood counts, like my bone marrow is making up for lost time.  I'm also more active than I was and maybe my muscles are just sore.  Advil is pretty effective, though, so it's manageable.  What I'm trying to avoid is being hyper attentive to every ache and pain, every body change.  I've spent so much time and energy being vigilant, but sometimes a sore back is just sore back muscles and not anything to write home about.  ",

I had nausea, but if I could get it down I could keep it down.   Other than nausea, my primary side effect was fatigue.   I found the side effects got progressively worse. Or rather, they didn't intensify, but they lasted longer.  AC#1 I was nauseas for a few days.  By #4, I'm 10 days post treatment and still queasy. For #1 - #3, the second week after treatment I not only felt normal, I felt a great sense of relief to feel normal!  My energy levels rebounded.  I regained some of the weight I lost the previous week, and I went back to a normal sleep schedule. I didn't get the body aches many report with neulesta and my blood cell counts were all good, so it did its job. I only got a sore mouth after #4, but it's manageable. Be kind to yourself. Get rest.  Accept help (Mealtrain.com has been useful to us for coordinating the goodwill and offers of help.) For nausea, stay hydrated and try to eat small meals, but more than the 3 per day we are used to.  But hydration is key! Oh - and the biggest effect of AC so far - bigger than anything - my tumor has shrunk dramatically.  It went from 6+ cm, obvious and painful,  to hard to find, even by my oncologist and painless.  So, you know, there's that.  :)",
