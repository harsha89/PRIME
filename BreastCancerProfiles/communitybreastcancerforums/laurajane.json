They just started me on Abraxane and it's still getting worse. They tried Xeloda and it didn't touch it. I'm going to ask my Onc about this Navelbine on Tuesday. Man I hope it works for you and gives you more time. What are you taking for pain. My onc has me on Oxy every 4 hrs and it barely touches the pain. Is your pain meds helping. I can truly understand your fear I selfishly thought I was the only one who had it moving so crazy fast in just four weeks. If you want to call and talk I will PM my number. You are more than welcome to cry, laugh or scream on my shoulder.",
