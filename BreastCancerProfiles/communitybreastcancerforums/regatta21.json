      "Content": "regatta21 wrote: The story: The breast surgeon said I would not need chemo because my tumor was less than 2 cm and stage one. I had a double Mastectomy for IBC -- and a month later, I had a flap surgery. I did not know I was supposed to meet with the oncologist before surgeries as I knew I would already need tamoxifen. Well, no one told me that they were going to run the oncotype test on me. I never heard about this even existed until my meeting with the oncologist three weeks after the flap surgery. Well it's turns out I needed chemo as I had a high oncotype test score TAC (recommended T first before AC). And I had to recover from the flap surgery while going through chemo. I find out that this slows down healing by about six months. Had I have known that I would be a candidate for chemo potentially going in to any of the surgeries, especially the flap surgery, I would've not had the flap surgery and just did implants. Anyone else recover from a flap surgery while doing chemo? The breast surgeon should not have said that to me. It was not her place or her job. This made cancer harder than it had to be.
