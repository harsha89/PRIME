I have to use a cane to walk with (or hold on to a shopping cart in stores) because the nerves in my lower back are compressed and it has affected my foot strength. I have trouble walking. This condition came on very suddenly when I was 50 years old and messed up my life. I have friends who have had back surgery and they complain about the results so I never rushed to have back surgery. It's one thing after another... I also had an ovarian dermoid cyst removed when I turned 50 when I went to the ob/gyn he found it while doing an ultrasound. Luckily it was benign. I also had a much larger dermoid removed from the other ovary, along with the ovary when I was a teenager. I'm still having hot flashes since I went through menopause and I also have nerve pain from my back issues. I actually thought that the nerve pain was hot flashes as I had never had a hot flash till I turned 50. I also get nerve pain in my face, why I have no idea. Maybe fibromyalgia or something. I also have some kind of internal tremors which comes and goes, the neurologist doesn't know why. She gave me some gabapentin but I didn't want to take that stuff it makes me feel dopey.  update: I looked it up and unfortunately it can cause blood clots. I had a DVT when I was pregnant 26 years ago...I don't know if they would give me that drug. I never took birth control pills before or after I got pregnant and my doctor never gave me HRT due to my blood clot risks. So I don't know...(my first ob/gyn misdiagnosed the DVT it could have killed me, I went for a second opinion at the time and they sent me for a ultrasound). Put me in the hospital immediately on Heparin on an IV. https://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/hormonal/serms/evista",

      "Content": "Jul 8, 2018 05:15AM - edited Jul 8, 2018 01:34PM by jenndenino578 Hi, I had a diagnosis of a radial scar. My breast surgeon decided to do an excisional biopsy to remove it after my needle biopsy and a breast MRI. There were ADH cells found in the radial scar along with UDH cells. My breast doctor decided not to put me on any hormonal medication. I don't know why except that he said that there are a lot of side effects. I should mention that I'm 58 y.o. and post menopausal. I had a sister who died at the young age 40 of leiomyosarcoma of the uterus. I have read that Tamoxifen can cause uterine leiomyosarcoma. (my sister wasn't on tamoxifen when she was diagnosed with uterine leiomyosarcoma, it just developed spontaneously when she was 37 years old after giving birth, she was initially misdiagnosed with a fibroid, the dr did not send her for any imaging tests such as an mri, big mistake.) I also have arthritis very bad in my lumbar spine and have trouble walking (have had to use a cane for the last 8 years) and I had a blood clot in my leg when I was pregnant 26 years ago. Tamoxifen can cause blood clots. Needless to say I'm very confused about what to do. My breast doctor didn't seem to think I should be on medication which surprised me. (It's been 3 weeks since my exisional biopsy). I really didn't have any severe problems after the surgery which only lasted about 20 minutes, I was put under general anesthesia and had no problems other than a sore throat afterwards. My breast surgeon wants to follow up in 6 months with a mammogram (that will be in December). He then wants to do follow up MRI's. Other than a 2 inch scar above my left nipple/areola I had no complications after the lumpectomy but I dislike looking at the scar or touching it. It feels \"lumpy\" underneath it which makes me nervous. I only had bruising after the surgery, it's pretty much cleared up now except for the scar tissue. I have an anxiety disorder and all of this stress is not helping it. I really don't want to take any of those medications but then I think what if I should get a second opinion? I hate this disease. I feel like I'm going to get cancer eventually and have to go through more traumatic treatments. I watched my sister die from cancer 16 years ago and I'm still angry about what happened. Her son was only 6 when she died and she was very sick for 3 years of his life. I feel as though he has ptsd from losing his mom so young. Also my mother is 80 years old, never had a bad mammogram. I also had 2 grandmothers who lived to be 88 and 89 and neither one of them was ever diagnosed with b.c. One more thing, I also feel as though this whole b.c. tx thing is a crapshoot. They need to find a vaccine or something to stop it from happening to begin with or at least to reduce women from getting it. I doubt that is going to happen in my lifetime if I make it to be 90! Many cancers are caused by viruses, I wonder if some of these breast cancers are caused by viruses.",

I had a radial scar and some atypical cells were found (atypical ductal hyperplasia). I am 58 y.o. though. I asked my breast surgeon do I need to be on hormone therapy and he says no. He says it has too many side effects. I have read up on it though and am not sure. Of course I don't want to take that medication (Tamoxifen) as it can cause uterine cancer and eye problems. My sister died of a form of uterine cancer (uterine leiomyosarcoma) at the age of 40, they have no idea what caused it. I also have a bad back (lumbar spine). I had an epidural steroid injection into my lumbar spine last summer (Kenalog 40) a steroid and 10 days later I had abnormal bleeding after being menopausal for over 4 years. The shots are known to cause abnormal bleeding in premenopausal and in postmenopausal women. I had to go to get a trans-vaginal ultrasound to check my uterine lining as my doctor freaked out when I called the office. So I no longer will get those shots, the one I had didn't help anyway. (My uterine lining was fine and the bleeding stopped after about a week). My last gyn exam was fine in March. But it makes me think that my uterine lining is sensitive to certain medications...who knows? I keep worrying about whether I should be on a medication though. I have to go back for another mammogram in 4-5 months. My mom is 81 years old and she never had a bad mammogram, she just had one 2 months ago. They told her everything was fine. She had no living sisters (one died at birth). My father's sisters never had bc, one of his sisters is still living and is about 88 years old. His other sister died of kidney cancer in her 80's. My dad died of a heart attack young. This is really stressing me out wondering about these hormone therapy medications though. I also read the A.I. hormone therapy causes joint pain....I already have severe arthritis in my lumbar spine with bone spurs (osteophytes).  p.s. I also had the \"savi-scout\" put in the week before surgery, they injected it with a big needle. My breast was sore afterwards. They removed it during the lumpectomy. I read it in my surgical pathology report. (I asked for the report before my doctor ran out the door). Doctors today don't spend much time with you from what I notice. (I also recorded the convo on my phone because he talks so fast and then runs out the door). Wanted to make sure I got all of the information down and wasn't about to start taking notes. They also made a mistake on my MRI report, I told the doctor about it and he said he would have if fixed but I bet it's still on there. The place is like an assembly line.",

(I'm embarrassed that I never had a mammo till my 50's, but from what I'm reading I am far from being the only woman who hadn't gotten one till a later age). I only went because I felt a cyst in my right breast (turned out to be benign looking, they haven't biopsied it). They're going to do ultrasounds and MRI's annually in the future. It seems that after I went through menopause I ended up with fibrocystic changes in my breasts and I can feels cysts in them when I do my self exams. I then asked one of my girlfriends if she had ever been called back after a mammogram, she is in her 50's also and she told me she hadn't had one in 20 years because breast cancer doesn't run in her family. (she had a baseline mammo at age 35). I told her maybe she should have one. But then I thought who am I to dispense medical advice? I've done a lot of reading since and mammograms miss plenty of cancers in women who have dense breast tissue. I knew of a woman who had annual mammograms then she found a lump in her breast in between mammograms which turned out to be an aggressive cancer. The mammograms never picked it up, I don't know why. She was someone who worked with my mother. Now I have to have them in the future every 6 months because of my dx of a radial scar which they removed 5 weeks ago. It was benign thank God but there were atypical cells found in it. So who knows what is coming down the road. I hope yours is also benign. And it's really good that the radiologist thinks that it is benign, when they found my architectural distortion they did a sonogram right afterward and they were acting like they thought it was going to be malignant although they never said that I could tell they were extremely concerned. And my gynecologist also called my house as I was walking in the door and she kept saying, \"I don't want to sugarcoat this, you have to have a biopsy right away.\" So I think that the radiologist must have told her on the phone that it looked very suspicious for cancer. I had an ultrasound guided core needle biopsy the next week and the radiologist that did it called me 2 days later and told me it was a radial scar and he didn't see any malignant cells. He knew what it was immediately. I was then referred to a breast surgeon and they removed the whole radial scar. They took out some tissue about the size of a grape according to the breast surgeon who removed it. then they biopsied the entire thing (the tissue that was removed). I got a call 2 days later that there was no \"upgrade to dcis\" which was what they were concerned about. But I have to be watched very carefully in the future. I am now considered at higher risk due to the radial scar and atypia.",

It's also itchy around the scar. The scar itself is also shrinking and pulling in. It was originally about 2 inches now it is shrinking up to an inch and a half. The surgical scar feels hard underneath. It's probably going to take a least a year or more for it to 'mature'. At first I was swollen and the indentation wasn't noticeable. Now it is more noticeable. I also have an abdominal scar from when I had surgery over 30 years ago, that scar still feels firm underneath. That one starts above my navel, goes around it and ends up at the pubic area. (I had a large dermoid which was benign removed). The final scar is dependent on how you heal I believe. I also had a second abdominal surgery via laparascope for another smaller dermoid on the other ovary. The stab scars from that one are tiny. I have a hard time finding them. So yeah, my breast doesn't look or feel like it did before but it's not that bad. My anxiety has gone down some from when everything started back in March. Regards, jenndenino",
