I would definately do something like Zometa as there is good evidence for it's use in bone mets. Apart from feeling a little fluey and achy the first couple of times I had it, I have no SE's from it that I notice. I'm deifinitely with the others on the communication thing. Your relationships with your onc and treatment team are some of the most important relationships you have in your life at the moment. It's vital that you trust them and they know what you need. Do what you need to do, to either make that happen or find it elsewhere. Definitely strength in numbers here!! Laurie x ",

Many oncs don't bother with TM's because they can go up and down seemingly randomly. My onc does then but I tell him I don't want to know as there's bugger all I can do about them  He always says that TM's are a very small part of the picture and only looks at them in conjunction with scans and how I'm feeling. Frankly, I would say that the difference between 188, 273 and 338 is pretty negligable - check out the queen of the TM's - Marybe who's had them up around 7000+ at one stage and are now on the way down! Good question to ask though - it's one we've all had thoughts about at one time or another! Laurie x  Edited for spelling and I'm still not sure that I've spelled negligable right! ",

(I'm a nurse and work with alcohol patients). Some of my patients drink a litre of vodka a day for a few years and amazingly have normal liver function tests although their ultrasound or CT usually shows a fatty liver or cirrhosis. The liver is  a pretty incredible organ and can take major hits without showing anything in the blood work. The flip side is I can see someone drinking 2 or 3 bottles of wine a week and their numbers are deranged. Don't read too much into it at this stage.  I have worsening liver mets and console myself with the fact that my numbers are still way better than most of my patients! Be aware that US on the liver will sometimes show things that turn out to be cycts - it's not terribly specific. CT or MRI would be better to rule anything out. Deep breath.

The problem might be if they don't have previous MRI's to compare with but it sounds like they're running around trying to compare a whole load of stuff so might be worthwhile. Lx ",

Scottish from Edinburgh but now live in the middle of middle England in an old village called Geddington. Diagnosed stage iv from the start after routine breast scan in June 2011. My cancer history (and failure of everything to help so far) is in my tag line. I'm 51 and on long term sick from my job as a nurse specialist in alcohol. 2 great kids - son Mischa 15, and daughter Marsaili 13. My aim is to make it to August for my sons 16th birthday. Also have Trevor, my incredibly supportive husband who I've been with since 1994. Used to be very positive and optimistic in the beginning but after 18+ months of liver progression, brain mets etc, quite honestly I can't be arsed to worry about the next scan, chemo etc. I'll try to rein in my personal pessimism because I know that there are a ton of women who are responding well to treatment and doing well. Hell I used to be such a fun gal to be around - maybe once I get some of this 14 litres off my abdomen tomorrow ill be in a better mood :-) Laurie x",

As some of the other gals have suggested, TM's are only one part of the story. My onc looks at them in conjunction with scans and how I am feeling in myself. At the moment, my TM's have gone up, however I feel very well so the onc has ordered a scan for the end of the month to check things out. It's very hard to put things away in a box, but please try to do this while you are waiting, so you can be there for your mom. I guess if you can be positive and calm, then this will translate to your mom and may help to relieve her anxiety. Best wishes to you both Laurie x",

The best we can do is to dust ourselves off and move on to the next one, living as we go. Hope this chemo is more successful for you. Hugs Laurie x PS: I have extensive bone mets - no pain either.

I was diagnosed stage 4 from the start with liver, lung and bone mets. My onc decided to start with chemo because of the liver mets and then move onto hormonals, however as barsco says, everyone is different and treatment will vary from person to person. If you do end up doing chemo at some point, it is doable and I've found it not too bad - but hope it doesn't come to that. Good luck and congratulations on the safe arrival of your baby  Laurie x ",

For the most part, the answer seems to be no.  She said to me that the good thing about the breast cancer community is that it is very open, with information and results being shared across countries. Last year she went to the first worldwide secondary breast cancer conference in Spain where they were trying to get a consensus on treatment for stage IV. I don't think they came to any great conclusions on what was the best way to treat stage IV so we're back to that thing that there are no right or wrong answers. She did say that UK oncs were more likely to stick with hormonals for longer however I guess that's a generalisation and it would be based on individual circumstances.  Personally if it were me, I would want to get a rationale from both oncs as to why they are suggesting what they're recommending. If there wasn't much in it, I'd opt for hormones every time... Laurie x ",

Assuming she was sitting / lying down for her reading as if she had suddenly stood up this could cause it to drop dramatically. As long as she's coping with a low BP, she should be OK in the short term. I'm 49 and pretty healthy (apart from the cancer!) and my BP jogs along around 90/60, dropping to 70/40 when I was last in hospital with a low white cell count. Guess her doc will be monitoring her pretty closely. Might be workthwhile buying a home BP monitoring device if that would ease your mind a bit. Love to you and your mother. Laurie x ",

Unfortunately their service isn't geared towards SBC and I think they don't really know what do do with me. Ended up calling the Breast Cancer Care helpline (I've never called a helpline in my life before) and spoke to a really fab woman who gave me all the stuff I should've had from the hospital.

Just had my first of 3 Docetaxel on Friday which I understand is the 'gold standard' for visceral mets.  Feeling pretty low.

Have the occasional mini-meltdown where I suddenly start crying for a couple of minutes, usually in the car and a more rare major one - like on Saturday when I went to bed at 4pm and literally put a pillow over my head to block out the day. The head in the sand / fingers in the ears La La La approach is my preferred option between scans and works pretty well. Yesterday, I heard that a lovely young woman called Tina from the UK board died. I didn't know her personally but got to know her through her posts, like you do. While every death from this bloody disease is tragic, hers seemed particularly so as she had been taken ill on the way to the airport last Thursday as she prepared to go to Disneyland Paris with her husband and 3 year old son; she died on Sunday. Had an up-all-nighter - my first for a few months - thinking about life in general, kids, money, and all that other 3am stuff. It struck me that my approach means that I am living my life as I always have. Some friends and people at work comment that I am really upbeat and that my approach is 'inspirational' but I think that's because I think about death in the abstract, like it's not going to happen to me, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. I wonder if I am limiting my options, living like this. If I could truly accept that I am dying (difficult when I am just on Tamoxifen and feeling very well) would I be really doing something different? Keeping that blog I meant to start for my kids; working my way through the mountain of fabric in the sewing room waiting to be sewn; doing something that I've always wanted to do - but don't know what it is. Don't get me wrong, I live for the day and find joy in so many things. I know that for some, faith is a great comfort as is the thought that they will see loved ones again. Unfortunately as an atheist (lapsed Catholic - believe me I've tried so hard...) it doesn't come onto my radar. As always, I figure that if this is something I am thinking about, there are others who have had these thoughts too. I guess my question is: How do you achieve a balance that's somewhere between denial and acceptance? Laurie  Stay in the present and live each day as it comes. Stage IV from the get go June 2011.

So many times people have told me to go but being the stubborn, awkward person I am, I do my own sweet thing which pisses everybody off but hey like you, I'm over 50 and can't see myself changing either! My onc has always told me that I am more at risk from myself than from others (bug wise) although I really wouldn't want to put that to the test in a crowded ER! I'm on Zometa and had some dental work just before starting Xeloda done by my friend who is a dentist. I had broken the back off a tooth and he fixed it up. I think it's just when they have to start taking teeth out that it can be a bit of a problem due to the risk of osteonecrosis (although I think it's a pretty slim risk) I think that getting specifics is a good idea. All this, \"Give us a call if you're not feeling well...\" Does my head in.  Hope you get ther ok on Monday. Laurie x ",

This is a coping strategy and a good thing, unless you're doing stuff like completely ignoring what is happening but sounds to me like you're just getting your head around stuff and that can take a while. That feeling of it all being a bit surreal is something we can all identify with here.  So the good thing is that you have no major organ involvement and there are lots of treatment options. Will it get better? Yes you will find a way of coping with this, putting one foot in front of another and living your life with your kids right now. There are lots of postive stories out there from women just like you. I notice you have a biblical quote in your tag line and maybe you can find some strength in your faith. I'm sure there will be a bunch of folk along soon to give you lots of good advice. Hang on in there. You can do this.  Hugs Laurie x ",

Generally speaking, I'd say your onc is right. You 'only' have bone mets (crap but it's all relative ) and hormones are a good place to start with lots of folk doing well with them. Assuming you will have regular scans to check things out so you can be switched to something else if things are not working. Your really don't want to do chemo unless you need to. Save the big guns. Get a second opinion to put your mind at rest and if you decide on the Tamoxifen, hope you can have a SE-free summer and a long waltz with one of the boys (Reggie, Stable or NED!) Hugs Laurie",

I guess I'll be elbowing my way in, trying to stay as the lynchpin of the family for as long as I can; it's a relief to know they can do it without me.  I recently started a private blog for my kids and husband to read after I've gone. I want to cover lots of stuff - memories of the kids when they were little, \"How I met your dad\", music / films I think they should listen to and watch - stuff like that.

Because you are strongly hormonal positive and your mets are 'just' in your bones (as opposed to organs where they tend to be more life-threatening), it sounds like your onc wants to start with the little guns and see how you respond and then keep the big guns (like chemo) for later. You may respond well to the Letrozole and you should have another scan in the first 10-12 weeks to see how things are going. You may want to talk to your onc and make sure he/she is communicating their expectations with you. It's always worthwhile to be up front with your onc and make sure you ask about all the options. Sometimes, oncs can make assumptions about what we want - e.g. that you would prefer a more gentle (hormonal) rather than an aggressive (chemo) treatment. Second opinions are always useful to get another perspective and also give you a chance to check things out with another specialist, especially when you walk away from the first one and then, 2 days later think, \"I wish I'd asked that!\" The most important thing is to have a team you feel you can trust and have confidence in.

I give the info as a psych nurse who prescribes anti-depressants and also as someone who spent 10 years on and off them after I had post-natal depression. Personally I found them to be really useful at times. They didn't make me happy but what they did was make me less worried about the stuff I never used to worry about before I was depressed! In the end I came off them because I found that I was living life in the middle; never really sad but never really happy.   Sorry you're having such a rough time with the pain. Hugs Laurie x ",

The other thing to consider is that we have all heard of women e.g. at a lower stage who had the works - MX, chemo, radio, herceptin, hormonals - were NED and then it came back.

Had a CXR and they have started me on oral antibiotics and something for oral thrush. Assume if my temp is stable I can go back home tomorrow. So staying in one of the guest rooms around the corner from the hospital which is nice and watching la vuelta (Tour of Spain - cycling) which is fab. Had a wander down the Kings Road which I haven't done for years - man the cash that is splashed around here! Have friends checking in on kids to make sure they don't drive my 74 year old dad crazy. Another friend offered to pick up my eBay bookcase so that's another thing ticked. Actually feeling ok at the mo (whisper it!). Earlier, got chatting to a guy whose wife is triple neg and is on her 4th chemo which is working - and it's the Havalen I'm on so I'll take a little bit of hope from that. Only down side of today was I decided that after 15 years, the sparkly belly bar has to go - just another potential source of infection and I can't imagine my stomach will ever be flat again. A small thing but I was a bit sad! Thanks so much for all your kind comments! Lx",

If she only has one met in her liver, she may be a candidate for targeted radiotherapy (In the UK it's called Cyberknife) and you may want to ask about this. One of the ladies on the board recently had a procedure called chemoembolisation where chemo is put directly into the liver (if you type it into the search, the thread should come up). Chemo makes you feel pretty crap but is doable and there is lots of chemo information on this site. As to how long you are likely to have your mom around - no one can say. However, there are increasing number of women (and men) living longer with mets due to new treatments etc.  It's great that you are being so supportive.

Reading through your post I wondered if the onc had said tumours or just spots (or both).  Along with other mets sites, I was diagnosed with a lung met however after recent scans, they now think it was something inflammatory, rather than tumour cells.  It's unusual (but not unheard of) to go from DCIS to stage IV. Where do you go from here? Do you have any more scans / another appointment booked? If it is lung mets, it would be worthwhile asking for a biopsy as tumours can change their status so while you were ER/PR/HER2+ this might have changed and would affect the course of your treatment.  If it is your 'worst case scenario' the most important things are: 1) Having an onc you can trust and feel comfortable with 2) Getting a treatment plan sorted. This may involve hormones/chemo depending on what is recommended and your own feelings about it. Remember, if you're not sure, its very worthwhile asking for a second opinion. I know your head must be spinning right now. Day at a time. Let us know how you get on and feel free to pm me. Hugs Laurie x  PS: Rule of the boards - don't Google Stage IV and anything to do with survival. It's out of date and will scare the crap outta you! Stay in the present and live each day as it comes. Stage IV from the get go June 2011. ER/PR+ HER 2- Liver, lung, bone & axillary mets.",

Is the draining making things more comfortable? I found it so difficult waddling around with my skin stretched to the max and no room for food or drink. I'm on a low dose - 2mg Dexamethasone while I have my WBR and like spamgirl says it does put the edge back on your appetite. High protein shakes could be good too but would it also help to see a dietician as maybe there are some essential things that need to be replaced that are coming out with the fluid which might help you to start building weight gradually?

The fact that she sent you an email (as opposed to a visit or phone call) suggests to me she's trying to keep everything at arms length while still trying to appear that she cares - or maybe she's doing it becase she thinks she should. She doesn't strike me as someone who can deal with real, hard-hitting emotions. At this point, it is worthwhile having a think about how much you want or need to invest in this relationship? If it were a friend, you'd have blown her out by now. I know families are different but at the end of the day, do you just need to be able to focus on the friends and family who are there for you and stop wasting precious energy on your sister who sounds like she's on 'Planet Me'.  Would it help to email her back and say exactly why you feel she has abandoned you? Sometimes, I find that people are so wrapped up in their own stuff, the things that they do and the effect they have on others doesn't really come onto their radar.  At the end of the day, this really isn't about her and she needs to know that Big hugs Laurie x ",

Just bought the Help to watch again and will have to rely on husbands choice for others (hmm dodgy DVD picker - he likes nice lurve films with beginning middle and end whereas I like thrillers and scifi - interesting to see what comes in...)

I was diagnosed last June and I live from scan to scan, then, as far as us humanly possible, after the scan results, I put it all back in a box, wrap it up with string, put it in a safe, put the safe in a cupboard and walk out of the room like it's not happening. I've wrestled with doing this. How can I ignore and deny something that is so huge and is having such a major impact on my life? So what is the alternative? I can: 1) Think about it every waking minute 2) Cry and feel sorry for myself and envious of everybody else 3) Mourn for the life I wanted that I now can't have  4) Think about dying and nothing-ness  (I'm an atheist and don't do the whole afterlife thing) 5) Think about how I won't be around for the kids Hell we can all fill in lists like this 'til we get to a few thousand and believe me, I think I've run through most of them at some time in the past 10 months! For me, waking up in the morning, thinking, \"I feel well today\" and refusing to think of the what ifs is the only way I can handle it without going mad. Who says I have to think about being terminal?Why should I? Sometimes I get so bloody bored of having cancer. I've got cancer - so what? Do I roll over and wait for it to come get me or do I just get so pissed off with thinking about it the whole time that I end up giving myself a really good talking to and move on to thinking about something else? I have today and when you think about it, whether or not we have a serious illness, it's all any of us can have. Oops turned into a bit of a rant towards cancer at the end there. Whatever you have to do to keep putting one foot in front of the other and looking forward to the day, do it. Have a great meet up with Apple and some pics of you both having a fine time would be fab to see  Hugs Laurie x ",

My last appointment with one of his minions a few weeks ago went badly with him telling me I had progression in my liver but not being able to say how much (because he's a numpty). So today I get the definitive result and apparently I have gone from around 5 in right lobe to multiple in both lobes but am trying not to panic as scan was done after my first 3 FEC chemo and I am about to have my last Docetaxel which I'm hoping is going to do it. I also had a breast MRI a few weeks ago but they have nothing to compare it to because they didn't do one before I started chemo.  What about my hormone levels and tumour markers? I asked. Um.... they don't seem to have been done. Well, I remember they took them but 'computer says No' Half way through the consultation he says, \"You seem a bit down today\" Hmm I think that might be something to do with the S IV breast cancer.   At this point, I really should have said, \"Fuck off mate, I'm off to the Marsden\"  but I got my prescription for Tamoxifen, and the form for my next bloods and I let him organise me a CT scan cause I though, you know what, I just can't be bothered with this. So I have my appointment through to transfer my care to a Prof. at the Royal Marsden in London who specialises in Stage IV. I am so glad I don't have to see that guy again or have anything to do with the Breast Care nurses (can't believe they have the temerity to include the word 'care' in their name - I've had nothing from them; no support, no information, they don't return my calls...)

Will you be going onto an AI or maybe back onto Tamoxifen (or had you been taking it for the full 5 years?) The other thing you may like to think about is that sometimes, the sneaky little buggers can change receptors, so it may be worthwhile asking about a biopsy to check you are still ER/PR+ and HER2-  Good luck with the Zometa - you'll be just fine.

I've given myself a good talking to and thankfully, I appear to be in a mood to listen - always a good sign Also feel I had a bit of a wake-up which jolted me out of my wallowing. Yesterday at my onc appt in London, I briefly met with one of the women - who I'll call Ms A - from my private FB mets group who is a bright and vibrant woman in her 50/60's and had travelled a long way accompanied by her friend, for a second opinion. She has Metaplastic BC and appeared to have been abandoned by her local team. Within the group, we all encouraged her to get a second opinion and raved about how great the Marsden is.  I txted her afterwards to see how she got on. They offered little hope, suggested another chemo but she was basically told (hopefully in a kind way because she had asked) that she may see Xmas but probably not another summer. I guess it brought it home to me that here I am, having a bit of a self-indulgent strop, being short with my family and generally being a drama queen darling, and I still have some hope in there somewhere. I am booked in for a drain on Thursday and chemo on Friday. My bone marrow appears to have recovered and finally, they have agreed to give me Filgrastim alongside the chemo to try to keep the neutropenia at bay. Also when I mentioned to the onc that I thought the ascites had been less after my first Eribulin, she checked back on my TM's (which I never ask about since there's bugger all I can do about them) and she said they had dropped a bit after my August chemo...  Just back from a lovely long bath at my neighbours house as I'm still waiting for the bathroom guy to come and give me a quote. Dad is still here lighting fires, painting, hoovering, washing (what a gem!) and my brother has just headed back to London to pace up and down waiting for an appointment at the US embassy for work visa's for him and the band he manages who are playing 3 promos in NY this month (They're called the Savages, a 4 women, post-punk group - apparently) He has flights and hotels booked but still no appointment for Visas... He's going to collect me from the hospital on Friday after chemo and bring me back on the train which is nice of him to do before he and my dad head back up the road to Edinburgh.  Just waiting for my fave film of the year (so far) to be delivered from Amazon so I can watch it with the kids on Pizza Friday. We did Hunger Games (great but grim) last week so am so looking forward to the uplifting story that is Moonrise Kingdom.

I've given myself a good talking to and thankfully, I appear to be in a mood to listen - always a good sign Also feel I had a bit of a wake-up which jolted me out of my wallowing. Yesterday at my onc appt in London, I briefly met with one of the women - who I'll call Ms A - from my private FB mets group who is a bright and vibrant woman in her 50/60's and had travelled a long way accompanied by her friend, for a second opinion. She has Metaplastic BC and appeared to have been abandoned by her local team. Within the group, we all encouraged her to get a second opinion and raved about how great the Marsden is.  I txted her afterwards to see how she got on. They offered little hope, suggested another chemo but she was basically told (hopefully in a kind way because she had asked) that she may see Xmas but probably not another summer. I guess it brought it home to me that here I am, having a bit of a self-indulgent strop, being short with my family and generally being a drama queen darling, and I still have some hope in there somewhere. I am booked in for a drain on Thursday and chemo on Friday. My bone marrow appears to have recovered and finally, they have agreed to give me Filgrastim alongside the chemo to try to keep the neutropenia at bay. Also when I mentioned to the onc that I thought the ascites had been less after my first Eribulin, she checked back on my TM's (which I never ask about since there's bugger all I can do about them) and she said they had dropped a bit after my August chemo...  Just back from a lovely long bath at my neighbours house as I'm still waiting for the bathroom guy to come and give me a quote. Dad is still here lighting fires, painting, hoovering, washing (what a gem!) and my brother has just headed back to London to pace up and down waiting for an appointment at the US embassy for work visa's for him and the band he manages who are playing 3 promos in NY this month (They're called the Savages, a 4 women, post-punk group - apparently) He has flights and hotels booked but still no appointment for Visas... He's going to collect me from the hospital on Friday after chemo and bring me back on the train which is nice of him to do before he and my dad head back up the road to Edinburgh.  Just waiting for my fave film of the year (so far) to be delivered from Amazon so I can watch it with the kids on Pizza Friday. We did Hunger Games (great but grim) last week so am so looking forward to the uplifting story that is Moonrise Kingdom.

Was her BC discovered after the build up of fluid was noticed? Any time the liver is involved, people often do feel very tired and nauseous, and I guess she probably hasn't been eating much. The important thing is to get the fluid out to make her comfortable, control nausea and pain and start to build her up so she is ready for her treatment, So good that you are there for her.

The amount of time they have left is displayed on their arm. It was an OK movie - not great but not bad and for me, with sore chemo feet and a strong aversion to anything that isn't low, soft and comfortable, the most amazing thing was Amanda whatshername's ability to run (fast) in 6 inch spikes - all the way through!  Anyway to my point. Some folk have loads of years on their arm and don't need to worry while the poor folk in the ghetto live from day to day. At some point Justin Timberlake (my he has grown up fine!) says something like, \"So we've only got one day on our arm - you can only live one day at a time\" (so what's the point of having months and years) and I thought, yep mate, you have a point there.

There still seems to be a bit of talk between the oncs about whether to treat me now or not - assuming because I have no symptoms, so maybe the want to do the 'wait and see' thing. I'm assuming that there is only so much radiation a person can have in a lifetime so it may be that this is the best approach - a bit like chemo where it' s bring out the big guys later.  OK ramble over. Back to you. I think that our mental response to progression gets quicker and better over time as we become more accustomed to it. We've done the crying on the floor, throwing stuff, swearing at the sky and after a while it just seems to take up too much energy that we could be using for the good stuff.  So feeling numb / shrugging acknowledges the \"yeah, yeah, so what?\" Is it going to change how you live right now in this minute or are you just going to keep on living the good life you're having.  You've got a great attitude going and I think you're doing everything right.

I had a routine breast scan in May last year and was confirmed with DCIS and a small invasive tumour with lymph node involvement in June. Staging 2 weeks later confirmed liver lung and spinal mets and I started chemo on 26th July so from stage 4 diagnosis to chemo it was around 4-5 weeks.   I understand the shock and the fact that you just want to get going on chemo. Personally I don't think this seems like a long time but that's just my experience. Do you know what chemo you are going to start with? I had FEC x3 first but had some progression and then Docetaxel x3 and I'm due to have my first scan since finishing in November next Monday.   There are lots of positive stories out there. Keep hold of hope. Laurie x ",

      "Content": "Apr 28, 2012 04:37AM alesta29 wrote: Interesting article and I have to agree with some of the things she said. I personally find my frequent flier alcohol dependent patients pretty challenging at times. Example: 45 year old woman who has been in hospital with bleeding oesophageal varices 3 times in the last 6 months. She is jaundiced and her liver numbers read like a big lottery win. If she carries on drinking, she'll be dead by Xmas. She'll go home and for the first few weeks, she'll be abstinent. Then she'll have a bad day and think, \"Hell just one won't hurt\" but because of her adiction, before you know it, she'll be back to a bottle or two of vodka a day and then back in the hospital, glowing like a lemon.  I really wish she could stop drinking but the reasons for her drinking are pretty complex and, like the doctor in the blog, I feel there is very little I can do to change things. The best I can do is to make sure I treat her with respect, acknowledge her difficulty, patch her up and send her home to repeat the cycle - except I always hope that this time will be different. Walking into the main doors of the hospital, there is often someone with a limb missing due to arterial disease, puffing on a fag. They keep smoking because 1) They're addicted. 2) They enjoy it. 3) They think, \"I've already got the disease and lost a leg, so I might as well carry on\" There has been a debate over here in the UK recently about whether or not it is right for a doctor to insist that a morbidly obese patient loses some weight before they get a hip replacement. On the one hand, is it right to allow someone to go on in pain (who probably can't exercise) or on the other, given that the hip replacement will not stand up to carrying the patient's weight and will fail, should it go to someone else who is in just as much pain and will do better? I don't have any answers and I would never advocate that people are 'blamed' for their illness. I do believe that people have to take responsibility for their own lives and as far as possible (economics and education allowing - those are biggies) they should do that.  I'm not sure what it's like in the US but over here in the UK, there seems to be a growing attitude amongst people I meet that if they get in a spot of bother, someone will be there to bail them out. There will always be those who need physical, mental and social support and that absolutely needs to be there but to the guy I saw the other day who had come into hospital begging for a detox and who then left sneaked in a bottle of vodka in a water bottle and created mayhem on the ward - I have no time for them. I discharged him  Interesting topic and no easy answers but good to debate Laurie ",

Believe it or not, things do get better although I know right now that thought seems a bit unbelievable.  You've already had some great advice. Stats are meaningless here. It's all about people and everybody's cancer is individual, so please don't scare yourself by googling \"Stage IV Breast Cancer Survival Rates\" I did that and it scared me to death (so to speak!). Remember that for everybody on the planet, it's one day at a time. I'm 8 months out of stage IV from the get go with mets to liver, lung and bones. I've done 5 months of chemo and am back working full time. I still have the occasional meltdown when I think of the future so mostly I just think about today and maybe the weekend. You will find your own way of coping with it and it sounds like you have comfort from your faith which is great. Expect a roller-coaster ride and don't beat yourself up when you're having a bad day (or even when you're having a good one). There is a wealth of experience here and hope you will come back for advice / support. Remember, there is no such thing as a stupid question! Deep breath and big hugs Laurie x ",

A few things came to mind when I read about your family get together and I wondered if it might be useful to imagine yourself sitting back in your house, the day after the get together and reflecting on how you would like it to have gone. Then focusing on the good time you have had, think about how you can manoever things to make sure that you get it. For example, if everyone knows you have cancer and you want to take a break from being cancer-lady for the day, can you get the message over that you just want to enjoy a bit of normality with the family and you'd rather not talk about it. Maybe you could get your partner, sister, mom or whoever to put this message over for you. It's inevitable that people will ask the question, \"How are you?\" as that's the kind of small talk we all do. I suppose the choice then may be to say, \"I'm fine, how are things with you\" and most people will happily talk about themselves until the cows come home.  One thing you may be worried about (and I'm very guilty of doing this myself) is wondering if this is going to be the last time you all get together. Sound familiar? The last Christmas, the last birthday etc. Big occasions by their very nature tend to make us reflect back on other occasions and look forward to ones still to come. I found I was starting to think like this about a few things and I got out of doing it by forcing myself to think about everything in that way for about an hour. e.g. \"This might be the last time I turn on the TV\", \"This might be the last time I get in my car\" \"This might be the last time I eat some chocolate\" Believe me, after 20 minutes of forcing myself to do this, I got pretty fed up, realised how much precious energy it was taking up and stopped doing it. There will always be a last time for everything but by focusing on it, you risk losing the joy of the occasion. The worry of breaking down in front of everyone is a feeling I guess we have all had at some stage but you know what, people really don't mind one bit and it often gives others the chance to say stuff that they want to say and to comfort you. You will always get the odd person who will shuffle around and look at their feet but that's their problem to deal with. The psychologist I spoke to after my diagnosis gave me a great answer after I told her I didn't like to cry in front of the kids. She said: Kids need to know that even though you are sad and crying, at some point, you will stop crying and be happy again. They learn that sadness is a part of life and then they don't get scared when you are crying - because they know you'll be OK again.  I hope you have a lovely time with your family (and your little whirlwind of fun!)

I can see many more days out on the horizon and if the kids miss the occasional hour or day of school - so be it. Glad you had a lovely day out with your daughter.  As Lynn points out, you just never know when you're gonna go. Nancy - loved to hear that about JT.

We seem to have a bit of a glut of period dramas at the mo. There's one called the Paradise which is about a department store in Edwardian times which I caught a bit of last night which was OK. My husband was very excited about the second series of Homeland which started here last week but I find it kinda depressing. Personally I can't wait for Veep to come back over this this way. It was done by one of my fave comedy writers (Armando Ianucci) who also did In the Loop and the very best satirical political drama of all time, The Thick of It which is very sweary but chock full of some of the most unsavoury politicos you'll ever come across. The scary thing is that I can imagine things are ike it in real life.... Sun is out, washing is out and I need to go get ready for my train trip down to London for drain and chemo.

Sometimes it seems pretty endless doesn't it - you get the crappy side effects and the pain and then the progression. We know we all have widely different responses to all the chemo thrown at us and it really is a bit of a crap shoot. So far all I have had is progression after 2 lots of chemo and Tamoxifen. Am thinking I will never get to stable and certainly never to NED with all the mets I have. It's tough - you're not a wimp. Sounds like a conversation with some palliative folk to get your symptoms under control would be a good place to start. As to when to stop - that really is a tough decision. I know one woman with liver mets who has been off treatment since December and she is nearing the end of her life now.   I hope you can find some solution that allows you to live comfortably and pain-free while you see how you respond to your current treatment. Maybe then you can feel ready to decide. Hugs Laurie x ",

Biggest problems I found were my taste buds which disappeared so it was a real struggle to eat anything and I got quite breathless as well.

I did it through my GP, basically went along with my husband for a bit of support, told him I wasn't happy with my care and gave him the name of the consultant I wanted to see at the Marsden. He then wrote a letter and I spoke to the consultants secretary who called me to arrange an appointment. The sec has also requested all my scans, reports, tissue samples etc to be sent. Most of the xrays and reports can go electronically. If you get the name of a consultant at Christie, you can always call their secretary (ask through switchboard) to say you are planning to transfer and ask what they need. If you have any probs, I would contact PALS (Patient Advice and Liaison Service) at your local hospital who are there to help. Don't let them tell you you can't do it. It's bollocks. I would definitely try again if you are unhappy. It's bad enough going through this crap and doubly bad if you end up with a team that don't care. Good luck Laurie x ",

Do you think the writing was linked to your blurred vision? I had some odd visual disturbances when I was first diagnosed when I couldn't focus and things were very wavy. GP put it down to stress as the brain scan I had was clear.  The fact that you are triple postive makes you less succeptible to brain mets (than you would be if you were triple negative). As to what you do - personally I'd be inclined to see how it goes over the weekend and go back to see your GP or eye folk if things haven't improved by Monday.  Hopefully there will be someone else along soon with their advice.

Think that more opinions are better than just 1 but at the end of the day, after taking everything into consideration, how do you think you will feel about living with the breast compared to having it removed? Maybe something to think about. One of the surgeons I spoke to says that he has done Mx in stage IV for psychological reasons in women who could not bear to keep their breast after the diagnosis.

It completely wipes me out and I generally spend 48 hours in bed on day 3 and 4.

I hold onto that thing which says that kids are incredibly resilient and resourcefull and very often breeze through the stuff we fret over. I think those of us with kids or grandkids of whatever age have had those feelings. For me it's the sheer unfairness of it all. Im bringing them up and don't want to miss a single minute. It's the one thing that always tears me up. As to how much she should see I think only time and your instinct will tell. I have a friend who was 7 when her mum died of a brain haemorrhage. No one told her she had died, only that she was in hospital. A month later a friend told her in the street that her mum had said that K's mum was dead. This was a few years ago and we have to hope things have moved on. Are you doing things to make memories - films, tapes, photos? It can be so hard but I think it's worth it. I've also spoken to friends who have promised to do things with my kids e.g. My daughters godmother is taking Marsaili and her own daughter to tea at the savoy for her 18th birthday and another friend has promised to teach her to sew in case I don't get around to it. And my step-daughters partner who gets on great with my son Mischa is going to teach him all about motorbikes and I plan to leave him some money so he can get a moped when he is 16. None of this is easy and I know having a much younger child makes things more tricky. Sure there will be some mums with younger kids along soon with lots of advice. Enjoy you time with your daughter every day! (((((hugs))))) Laurie x",

The liver is pretty resilient and as Rose said, it can still function with a lot of tumours. While hormone therapy is of course an option assuming your mom is ER/PR+ I would have thought that with 80% of her liver tumourous, chemo should be used first as it generally tends to shrink things faster than hormones. You might want to ask the onc about that. Once the liver tumours are under control, her jaundice should go. Also does your mom know her HER2 status as if she's positive, she should also be on Herceptin unless the onc thinks it's contraindicated. She may need a liver biopsy to be sure. As to lifting spirits, the first few weeks of a diagnosis will be the toughest for you and for your mom and if you're all still spending the days between shock and tears, I'd say that's about normal. Things will get better and you will all find a way of coping with this.  Let us know how things go. Laurie x ",
