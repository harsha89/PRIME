By being open about it I found it alot easier to deal with everyday life.  Normally I am a private person but for this I was a very open person. Just follow your instinct regarding who you tell.",

Another recommendation is if you still have the drains and are trying to take a shower use a piece of ribbon or string around the waist to hold the drains.  I was able to start taking showers 5 days after surgery and found the ribbon helped.",

The Neulasta helps stimulate WBC growth.  In my case it was essential because the first treatment did not include it and I ended up in the hospital because my WBC's were way to low.",
