You have plenty of time to buy things in between treatments if you should need them and you'll probably have people looking for things to do for you anyway. The only thing I think you have to get beforehand is Claritin because you will have to start taking it a few days before treatment. And yes, it is an antihistamine but for some reason it does help with bone pain. Maybe stock up on foods/drinks that you usually tolerate when your stomach is upset. And if you should choose to cold cap you'll have to research that and get what you need beforehand as well. That's it. I pretty much used/or did none of the other things on the list. Good luck on your chemo. It's not easy but it'll be over before you know.",

They realized that they haven't scanned the healthy breast since 2015. Fortunately, nothing showed up. (But then again nothing showed up on the bad boob back then, either.) I'm doing well. My hair is really starting to come in and the texture is going back to what it was before chemo. The ridges on my nails have finally grown out. My tumor was on the lower inside of my breast and it has really kind of caved in where the lumpectomy was. It has caused my nipple to become inverted and face a weird direction and the skin is very thick. I've been told to massage it and to wear compression bras with one of the little chicken cutlets to fill in the gap. I guess it's not bad enough for cosmetic surgery but even if it were, I don't know if I would want to put a foreign object in my breast or risk necrosis. The hormone therapy is rough. I wake up each morning my hands in claws and unable to bend my ankles but it goes away pretty quickly once I start moving. The night sweats are ridiculous. I look like a fountain at times. Sex is painful. Two of my docs are suggesting that I use estrogen cream but are deferring to my MO who I won't see again until August. I know most of my post has nothing to do with chemo but this really has become the only thread I feel comfortable on. The others seem to have a few regulars who just chat with each other and bully those who don't agree with their views.

If they fall out before then, I'm going to book an appointment at an Ulta's Brow Bar to see if they can show me how to draw brows. ACS74, Funny thing but my period also started out strong a few days before my infusion as well. I had an endometrial ablation years ago and it is usually just one day of barely there spotting so this heavier flow was odd. My MO said chemo would most likely make me post-menopausal anyway since I'm over 50. Good riddance. lmenken, I don't know what the deal is with Claritin but so far it seems to be working. I've read it could be any antihistamine but tests have only been done on Claritin. This is high season for allergies for me and I usually take Allegra but I switched to Claritin just in case. I might stick with Allegra for my next infusion just to see what happens. I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop but I still feel pretty good. What is the saying? Anticipate the worse but expect the best?

I looked at the prices of generic pepto and saw that the bottles of milk of magnesia right next to them were half the price! Score!

And to be honest, I think the over the top effort from my company may have been to play down an incident that happened earlier. On day 6 of my first infusion, I sent an email to my boss and the office manager that I would be working from home that day because I was feeling weak. The office manager sent back an email stating that I could not work from home when I am \"under the weather\" and that I had to take PTO. Shortly after that the bone pain set in and I ended up in a fetal position on the floor of my bathroom sobbing and wondering how the hell I was going to manage to work at all and pay my bills. It has since been resolved but I still get angry when I think about the needless cruelty from the office manager. There has been a news story locally about a woman pretending to have cancer to get money. I'm guessing the office manager thinks I'm faking it since I look really healthy, even though I've asked for nothing other than to work from home on bad days. Seriously, my skin looks amazing right now, I would be suspicious but it's kind of hard to fake this haircut (tweeze individual hairs for hours?",

We discussed my hot flashes and he's certain it is menopause. He wants me to start hormone therapy as soon as I'm done with radiation and it is to be an AI and not Tamoxifen. He took a look at my incision and told me that my nipple is probably permanently inverted and may get worse during radiation. Ugh. Speaking of hot flashes, I had one during the infusion today at the end of the Taxotere. The nurse came running over and stopped the drip, I told her it was just a hot flash but no, she had to consult with the doctor. They decided to give me more Benedryl and then saline for 10 minutes before they started the Taxotere at a slower pace. I was there FOREVER. I had another hot flash during the Cytoxan and hid my flush face so the nurse wouldn't see me. This same nurse put my Neulasta pod on the muscle of my arm instead of the fat in the back. It hurt when it the needle when it and now I'm worried it wont inject properly tomorrow. She admitted this was the first time she put one on. I'm so glad I'm done with this crap.",

I haven't had a chance to look into it between work and radiation. Besides, I worked in health insurance many years ago and I have a good idea how this will work out. Neulasta is probably on the auto-reject list and some clerk didn't match it up with the pre-certification. I'll let the doctor's office battle it because they'll want their money and it's more likely to come from the insurance company than me. I'm three weeks out from my last chemo treatment and my eyebrows are still thinning. If I may make a plug: IT Brow Power. I used it before chemo to cover the greys in my brows but I was really impressed when I attended the Look Good, Feel Better class and every kit had one in it. Nobody knows that I've lost about 70% of my brows because of this product and I want to support a company that quietly and without fanfare made such a big donation to help women with breast cancer. Plus, it is an awesome product. Speaking of hair, when I run my hand over my scalp I can feel stubble but I can't see it. I think this weekend I'll shave my head because the few hairs left have grown and now stick out like some mad scientist and I'd like it to be the same length as the new hair coming in.",

That was pretty awful but worth it. In addition to the fat injections, my surgeon \"released\" the scar tissue that radiation caused which made my breast turn in on itself and inverted my nipple. Now my aureola and nipple are back in the middle of my breast. I am told I may need a couple more grafts to fill in the dents.

The other ladies were fascinated by my hair loss and it ended up being a half hour discussion. They were in so much pain thinking this was going to happen to them. I don't know if I can articulate what is going on in my head with the hair loss. I barely make the cut to get chemo to begin with. I am taking what is considered by many as the mildest form of chemo. Yet, I have pretty severe hair loss early on. It makes me think it might be permanent. Sure it bothers me but when I put in perspective, it's nothing really. I have a husband who adores me and thinks I'm beautiful no matter what. My children are grown and one is even an RN that I can talk to about some of this. I have a job that I like, for the most part, and has cooperated with all my medical appointments. Friends have come out of the woodwork to support me. I'm in a good place. I don't know if all my babbling is of any help to anybody but I hope it is. I hope my pictures show that an overweight middle aged woman with no hair can look good and be happy.

I'm worried how bad it will get after my last infusion which is this coming Wednesday. My worst symptom right now is chemo induced menopause. The hot flashes are manageable except for my big bald head. I've always sweated a lot from my scalp but without any hair to hold it, I look like a human water fountain.",

I'm tired but that's mostly because of the benedryl they gave me and the lack of sleep last night from the dexamethasone. I think I talked them into giving me the Neulasta pack for my next infusion instead of making me come back in. After all, I am still working full time. I got my Phil's Friends box yesterday. It was packed full! And even the box was decorated. Very thoughtful. It was nice to come home from work with the weight of upcoming chemo on my shoulders and find that waiting for me. But I haven't gotten any of the other freebies other than the most important one: the wig from the American Cancer Society but I had to make an appointment for that. My hair is already grey and fairly short so I too am looking forward to the full Carol look from Walking Dead. However, none of the grey wigs looked right so I decided to get a medium brown bob that flattered my face and skin for a different and fun look. Speaking of freebies, I tried the fighting pretty site and they wanted a 30 dollar donation. Anybody else have the same problem? I kind of feel petty but I'm sure people are making donations yet they are expecting even more donations to send out packages.",

It works most of the time but when I have to go through something like taking an antibiotic, I double down on any food that might contain probiotics. I figure it can help with chemo too. So far, I'm not experiencing any nausea, I haven't had to take a Zofran and my nether regions are still happy. Kombucha is a fermented tea.

You and I are on the same chemo and your schedule is only a day behind mine so I'm definitely going to be quietly following your symptoms like I do many others on this thread. So the Milk of Magnesia was pretty much just spitting in the ocean. It didn't help, obviously, but it didn't make anything worse. This morning I broke down and took an Imodium. It hasn't stopped the diarrhea but it has slowed it way down. I actually sat through an hour meeting at work without having to bolt. My scalp is starting to tingle now but no shedding yet. Every day is an adventure. Oh, I forgot to mention my chemo bag routine. My chemo room has no breakfast or lunch; just bags of chips and crackers. No TV; just a radio playing top 40. Plenty of warm blankets, though. I don't really bring anything other than something to read or mess around on the internet.  ",

Not enough lubrication the world to make sex comfortable right now so I'm trying estrogen cream and if it works, I'll be switching from Arimidex to Tamoxifen. My metabolism is gone. I lost 20 lbs of the chemo/steroid weight and gained most of it back. After all the chemo and radiation, the swelling in my affected breast went down and now it looks like a caved in rotten peach. Nearly a third of it is gone. My MO mentioned that I should ask my BS if I'm a candidate for fat grafting. A year ago I would have said no way but now I'm considering it. Has anybody here considered fat grafting for a lumpectomy? But I'm here and doing okay. Not so much with others in my life. Almost a year to the day I started chemo, my dad started his chemo. Big difference is he has stage 4 rectal cancer that had already spread to his lungs and possibly his liver. Chemo was rough for me and I'm considerably younger and was in great health when I started. My dad, not so much. I'm afraid he's not going to be with us for very long. I'm reliving last year through him but it's worse because there's no light at the end of the tunnel.
