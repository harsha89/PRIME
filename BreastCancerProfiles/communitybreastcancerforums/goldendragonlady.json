How do they know it's a new cancer.  I know, I know, everything I have read says that bc only rarely spreads to the other breast, but how can they tell for sure?  Do they do some sort of test?  In any case what type of treatment do they reccomend when you have been taking tamox and it comes back anyway?? tumor #1 1.8 cm IDC histo 3 - 3, nuc 2 - 3, mitotic - 1 - 3, bloom-richardson 6/9.  Final path. tumor #2   .7 cm IDC histo 3 - 3, nuc 2 - 3, mitotic - 2 - 3, bloom-richardson 7/9   Core biopsy.

I had one done in 05 on my right breast.  The first tumor was about the 1:00 position on the top of my breast about halfway between the top of my breast and my nipple. It was deep down, almost to the chest wall.  The 05 surgery was not very painful afterwards,  just a little soreness which gradually went away.  This new tumor was in my left breast about 1 inch below my nipple and about an inch deep.  It was a little sore at first but got better over the first week. The last couple of days though my nipple has become much more sensitive and hurts sometimes even when I am not moving around.  The pain is not bad, just distracting.  The surgeon made the incision along the line of my areola to reduce the visibility of the scar.  I went in to see my onc and she mentioned it looked a little swollen, but it was not painful then.  I go in to see the surgeon on Friday for my post surg check.  I have been trying to streatch it a little bit .  Maybe I over did it??  Are incisions more towards the nipple/lower part of the breast more painful??  Anybody know??
