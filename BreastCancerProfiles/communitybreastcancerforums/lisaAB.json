A recent bone scan lit up my jaw and 2 new places on cervical spine. I was sent for CT of head & neck. The results were terrific the changes there were only athropic. I'm planning on talking with MD this wk, but curious if anyone developed similar problems.which became necrotic (sp?) or better put did your arthropathy develop into death of jawbone,,wondering if I'm more likely to have problems in the future with this due to mets to bone? lisaAB lisaAB Dx 2007, Stage IV, ER+/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I like the NP, but I feel it is my right to have the \"expert\" present for my questions and to hear the results directly from the doctor. It is very important at this point in my cancer (stage 4) to have a relationship with my doctor. I actually went 2 full years without ever seeing the MD during followup to the initial treatments. That doctor is gone and I have a chance to actually be cared for as a person with a new doctor. I actually got angry when recently I had a scheduled appt. with followup to PET/CT scans with the doctor and at the visit was told I'd be once again seeing the NP..the hospital actually paged the MD who came to see me..how sad that this isn't standard practice though..and the patient as to be made to feel like a demanding pain to get time with the care provider the insurance/copay is paying for! Has anyone had these experiences too..what do you think? lisaAB Dx 2007, Stage IV, ER+/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
