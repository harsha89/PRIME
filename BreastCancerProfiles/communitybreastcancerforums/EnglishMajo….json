Statistically, I believe that most breast cancer is sporadic (vs. inheirited). At a basic level. cancer signifies cells gone wild.  Before you had cancer, cell division proceeded in an orderly fashion. What made our cells start spreading like kudzu? It could be a combination of environmental and other factors. (For example, in my case, not having kids resulted in decades of unopposed estrogen which probably wasn't good. My mom died of breast cancer in her 50s--I don't have the BRCA gene, but maybe I just have one they haven't decoded yet.) I was in a stressful job and I don't think that helped either.   Here's what NCI says:  The genetic material (DNA) of a cell can become damaged or changed, producing mutations that affect normal cell growth and division. When this happens, cells do not die when they should and new cells form when the body does not need them. http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/stress Can stress increase a person's risk of developing cancer? Studies done over the past 30 years that examined the relationship between psychological factors, including stress, and cancer risk have produced conflicting results. Although the results of some studies have indicated a link between various psychological factors and an increased risk of developing cancer, a direct cause-and-effect relationship has not been proven (3, 4). Some studies have indicated an indirect relationship between stress and certain types of virus-related tumors. Evidence from both animal and human studies suggests that chronic stress weakens a person's immune system, which in turn may affect the incidence of virus-associated cancers, such as Kaposi sarcoma and some lymphomas (5). More recent research with animal models (animals with a disease that is similar to or the same as a disease in humans) suggests that the body's neuroendocrine response (release of hormones into the blood in response to stimulation of the nervous system) can directly alter important processes in cells that help protect against the formation of cancer, such as DNA repair and the regulation of cell growth (6).",

      "Content": "Apr 7, 2012 08:54AM - edited Apr 7, 2012 08:55AM by EnglishMajor I thought Musa Mayer at www.bcmets.org made some good points: She writes:   ....the guideline about follow-up after early breast cancer has been an ASCO recommendation for 13 years, as you can see from looking here at this 2006 update of the 1999 guideline:  So ASCO issuing this recommendation is nothing new, and still about a third of oncologists use these tests for follow-up anyway. Neither is the recommendation for discontinuation of chemotherapy after three failed regimens in bedridden metastatic cancer patients anything new. This has been a part of the NCCN guidelines for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer for as long as I can remember. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines are the most widely used and respected guidelines for cancer issued annually. Look at page BINV-19 of the Breast Cancer Clinical Practice Guidelines, which you can find on the NCCN website at www.nccn.org You have to register to get access, which is why I can't give you the exact webpage for the guidelines. So, these guidelines have been in place for many years, and yet treatment options for women with mets continue to increase, and proactive, informed, insured women like yourselves are able to gain access to as many lines of treatment as you feel are right for you. From the widespread negative reaction to these recommendations, I'm quite confident that's not going to change any time soon. I think the strongest motivation behind this recommendation is the wish to spare patients near death the added pain and suffering from chemotherapy drugs administered in the week or two prior to death, and allow a more peaceful passing. If chemo at the end of life was a rare occurrence, that would be one thing, but studies that indicate it happens 20-50% of the time to cancer patients. To me, that is horrifying, and I too would like to believe there might be a way to avoid that added misery, a way easier than having the difficult conversations about dying so many avoid at all costs. But I think that thi recommendations will simply be ignored, as the existing guidelines have been, because of the powerful reactions people have to the thought that their choices for treatment might be restricted, and that their sense of hope would be taken away. Here's what haunts me, though. When they studied metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients on fourth-line chemotherapy, they found that 0% responded to the chemo, and that it made them die much sooner. As in months sooner. The concern is that this may also be true for other kinds of cancer, that there comes a time when further treatment is futile and toxic, and that patients may live longer without chemotherapy after it stops working when tried repeatedly, leaving them precious time with their families, but we don't know that. It's not the patients like you who are most likely to have this happen to them. It's the many, many, many people who don't ever talk about this with their doctors or with their families, who don't understand or don't have explained their treatment options, the risks, benefits and chances of response, the patients whose families pressure them to keep on receiving treatment. And it's the doctors who are uncomfortable with any discussion of dying, who feel a sense of personal failure, who can't stop treating patients, who ignore their responsibility as healers to help their patients through this final transition... ...I don't know what the answer is. Guidelines are only that, and many if not most doctors and patients will make other choices, rightly or wrongly. But I don't think they are anything to be feared. To me, it is never an either/or...we always need to weigh both the evidence AND what patients want. I just always want decisions to be as informed as possible. Musa",

CONCLUSIONS: Surgical extirpation of the primary tumor in patients with synchronous stage IV disease is associated with improved metastatic PFS when performed more than 3 months after diagnosis. Resection should be planned with the intent of obtaining negative margins. HOWEVER, this paper from Brigham and Women's in Boston does NOT see any real benefit: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18581232 Bafford AC et al. Breast surgery in stage IV breast cancer: impact of staging and patient selection on overall survival. Breast Cancer Research and Treatment 2009;115:7-12 Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston - Review of prospectively maintained database of 147 women who presented with stage IV breast cancer between 1998 and 2005. CONCLUSIONS: Breast surgery is associated with improved survival in stage IV breast cancer. However, in our experience, this benefit is only realized among patients operated on before diagnosis of metastatic disease and is likely a consequence of stage migration bias. While some women may warrant palliative surgery to the breast, it is unclear that such surgery otherwise improves clinical outcomes. The possible biases in these retrospective studies are summed up well in this editorial (the link should take you to the whole article): http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077920/?tool=pubmed Khan SA. Primary Tumor Resection in Stage IV Breast Cancer: Consistent Benefit, or Consistent Bias? Annals of Surgical Oncolog 2007;14:3285-3287 ...five retrospective studies... present us with consistent evidence that either surgical therapy of the primary tumor has a substantial survival benefit in women with metastatic breast cancer, or there is a strong and consistent selection bias driving the use of surgery in women who have more favorable profiles (i.e., younger age, smaller tumor burden, better access to care). It is also possible that surgery is a surrogate indicator of more aggressive therapy overall, including more aggressive systemic therapy, which translates into better survival. All authors acknowledge the problem of selection bias in the interpretation of these data, and all advocate for a randomized trial to settle this question.",

To the point of telling me about losing my hair and then showing me the infusion room on my way out. This was all a bit premature--but based on her outline, I had a port put in at the same time they did the bone biopsy.  At my second and LAST appointment with her she very casually said \"Oh, you'll start with tamoxifen.\" Me: \"So what do I have this port for?\"   Her: \"Blahblahblahblah....\" On the one hand, I was very fortunate I could start with the mildest option first.  And, I have used the port for blood draws and zometa (bone booster infusion). I did not have nearly the preparation ordeal that you did, but I really found this big switch upsetting--I was braced for one thing and then wham! Not doing that. (Altho yes, I am glad I could hold off on chemo.) It is small comfort, but virtually everyone with bone mets will get zometa or xgeva (bone booster) and you do have to have your teeth fixed before you can do those. So your efforts are not in vain, you probably would need to get your teeth fixed very soon.  I don't think my original oconologist understood why this big change (with no warning) from her original plan was so upsetting. I felt she could have given equal time to BOTH treatment possibilities. When I asked her why she NEVER mentioned tamoxifen during our first meeting, she was very patronizing---as tho I was off my nut. My second opinion oncologist confirmed that tamoxifen was an appropriate treatment. I liked her a LOT better than Dr. Debbie Downer, so I switched. If you have the option of getting a second opinion, it can only help. It probably won't change the treatment plan, but maybe you can find a better communicator! Hang in there",

Bone biopsy isn't routine--it depends on the location and other factors. There might be concern with the rib or spot where it is located.  I also had a CT and MRI when I was dx'd stage IV. I did have a PET some months later.  After  a year or so in tx, I had some inconclusive scans (bone, CT and PET). So the dr. sent me for an xray.  After I was stable on antihormonal tx for about six months, I did have a mx. There is thought to be some benefit in some cases. Triple positive cancer is less responsive to antihormonal tx and is often more aggressive. So chemo is often used early on. (I haven't had chemo yet, I am HER2-) http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/BoneMetastasis/OverviewGuide/bone-metastasis-overview-diagnosed  The ACS offers this explanation of imaging tests: Imaging tests to find bone metastases X-rays: X-rays of the bone can show signs that the cancer has spread. X-rays can also find breaks in bones that have been weakened by mets. Bone scan: This test helps show whether a cancer has spread to the bones. A radioactive substance is put into a vein and collects in diseased bone cells throughout in the body. These areas can be seen on the scan and are called \"hot spots.\" Bone scans can often find mets much sooner than normal x-rays. But arthritis, infection, or other bone diseases can also cause hot spots. CT scans: The CT scan uses an x-ray beam to take a series of pictures of the body from many angles. A computer combines the pictures to form a detailed image. If bone scans or x-rays do not show mets, this test can help tell whether the cancer has spread into your bones. MRI scans: Like a CT scan, the MRI shows a cross-sectional picture of the body. But the MRI uses radio waves and strong magnets instead of x-rays. MRI scans are especially useful for looking at the spine and spinal cord. PET scan: PET scans use a radioactive form of sugar that is put into a vein. Cancer cells in the body quickly take in the sugar. A special camera is then used to show where the sugar collects. This test can find groups of cancer cells that are too small to see with other tests. It is also helpful when the doctor thinks the cancer has spread but doesn't know where. Newer machines can combine PET and CT scans to give pictures with more details.",

One doctor I know likes to say: \"If cancer is the answer than the tissue is the issue.\"  Meaning they must have your biopsy results before they can \"officially\" determine the best treatment. Zoladex is ovarian suppression, meaning it will stop your ovaries from making estrogren. If your cancer is ER/PR postive, estrogen will help it grow. So thus ovarian suppression for premenopaual women and tamoxifen (binds to estrogen receptor so estrogen can't get in there).  If your biopsy were to show you are ER/PR negative, ovarian suppression (Zoladex) wouldn't necessariy be appropriate.  I was first dx'd in first week of  August, didn't start actual treatment till about  mid Sept, (waiting for test results, etc.)   I was definitely on edge during the rollercoaster of those months. Many ladies find Ativan very effective for dealing with the stress, etc. Consider asking your doctor about it. Hang in there, you are on the right track.",

So in trying to pray, you are indeed praying.  I have not been a church goer really since childhood. But I would like to go back and that is my goal in the weeks leading up to Easter. Some hospital chaplains of all faiths recently spoke at a meeting for cancer patients. I have thought about getting in touch with one of them--I think they could help. Sometimes I consider my situation: I have metastatic breast cancer. Even tho I (and medical imaging) can't see most of the cancer, save some spots on my spine, I know it is there. I can't see God either, but  I know He is there.  Not that I don't have my doubts on some days.

From what you have said, the treatment sounds reasonable. But if you don't feel your doctor is listening to you, you may want to consider finding an oncologist you have a better partnership with. (As Dr. Larry Norton says, \"If you don't like your doctor, he probably doesn't like you either.\" ) A new doctor could also serve as a second opinion, which would provide peace of mind.   Your treatment. I also presented with bone mets, but I don't have lobular cancer. Surgery is not standard of care of Stage IV people--but in some instances it is thought to be of benefit. Can you clarify why surgery was recommended off the bat? (Didn't know if it had to do with being lobular or something else.) Can you clarify how you came to have recon right away? (Often it is delayed in case the person needs rads.) The rads issue can be six of one, 1/2 dozen of another. It is  a decision often made in consultation with the radiologist and the oncologist. In terms of tracking---that's a tricky issue. Generally speaking, all tests are considered in aggregate--a rising tumor marker would be considered with scan results and the patient's overall well being. (At every appointment an oncologist will typically ask about your energy level, unexpected weigh loss and any new symptoms, such as shortness of breath or  bone pain that persists for a couple weeks.)  In general, for someone with hormone receptor positive bone-only disease, chemo would be reserved until all the antihormonals had been tried. There are probably 5 other antihormonals. It is likely too soon to determine if the tx is working. In terms of the rash, I suggest asking for a referral to a dermatologist. It will put your mind at ease. Hang in there.  ",

This misconception may be based in part on a misunderstanding of positron emission tomography (PET) scans, which use a small amount of radioactive tracer - typically a form of glucose. All tissues in your body absorb some of this tracer, but tissues that are using more energy - including cancer cells - absorb greater amounts. For this reason, some people have concluded that cancer cells grow faster on sugar. But this isn't true. http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/cancer-causes/CA00085/NSECTIONGROUP=2",

One local couple is frustrated with the Food and Drug Administration's approval process and is demanding changes. Lorraine Heidke-McCartin and her husband, Phil, recently returned from their sixth trip to Virginia this winter. That's the closest place offering an experimental drug to control her advanced breast cancer, the couple said. \"I just had my first CAT scan done the week before last and everything has shrunk or it's gone already,\" Heidke-McCartin said. In studies, T-DM1, a combination of Herceptin and chemotherapy, has shrunk tumors in 33 percent of women with advanced disease, according to Genentech, the drug maker. It also has few side effects. But the travel, at her own expense, has taken a toll on the 54-year-old Hanson woman. \"It doesn't have to do with the treatment itself, but it has to do with what you're putting a stage IV, critically ill, terminally ill person through to get a drug,\" Heidke-McCartin said. Last summer, doctors told Heidke-McCartin she was a perfect candidate for the drug and would start receiving it in Boston at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in September. \"Then I picked up the paper, the FDA pulled the rug out, said Phil McCartin. \"It's just baffling to me why the FDA did this.\" The FDA denied accelerated approval and, according to a spokeswoman, will not comment publicly on the reason. In a statement, drug maker Genetech said the FDA told them the drug did not meet the standard for accelerated approval \"because all available treatment choices... had not been exhausted\" among those in the study. That infuriates Lorraine's husband. \"She and hundreds and hundreds of other women across the country have already exhausted all those other options,\" McCartin said. Sen. John Kerry fired off a letter to the FDA, writing, \"Especially when patients have exhausted existing treatment options, they shouldn't have to face unnecessary obstacles to innovative treatments that are potentially life-saving.\" \"As a general rule, it takes too long to get drugs to people who need them,\" said Dr. Eric Winer, director of the breast oncology center at Dana-Farber. Winer said the overall drug approval process needs to be accelerated. \"One of those ways. potentially, is to issue preliminary approvals, do more definitive studies and recognize they may or may not get final approval,\" Winer said. Genentech spokeswoman Krysta Pellegrino said, \"We are really committed to this medicine.\" She said potential FDA approval isn't likely until late 2012 or early 2013. After several doses of T-DM1, Lorraine is looking better and feeling better. \"They're asking me how I'm doing, and I got very teary, and I said for the first time in I can't tell you how long, I feel like me.\" Heidke-McCartin said. \"I was able to play on the ground with my grandchildren, run around with them. Do those kind of things that I've always dreamed I would be doing at this age.\"",

AIs tend to worsen bone loss and increase fracture risk.(A patient prone to falling or someone who has had a broken bone due to osteoporosis probably should not be taking AIs.) Should your MIL be taking appropriate calcium and vitamin D3 supplements?   Oncologists rely on clinical signs to go with test resutlts. As you will know from your prior appointments, they will want to know if your MIL has any new bone pain, how her energy level is and how her appetite is. If any changes, of course, bring this up.  Take care",

I really want to quit (not just bc  of this coworker) but I don't have the nerve and frankly having been at one place so long, looking for another job is pretty unsettling.  Thankfully, the majority of people I work with are pretty decent. I think if I concentrate on inhaling/exhaling, I'll be ok!  ",

Interestingly, when my collegue had to have surgery (sinus) it was scheduled for the early part of December. So, just like when you get a Triple Word Score in Scrabble, because of the holidays, the time off was maximized. I would have to doublecheck, but I think she was out longer than me for this mx!

You are right about forgoing personal slights in favor of professional issues. I think I am just going to cool off and try to put things in perspective. In the larger picture this is a petty disagreement--we're lucky we both still have jobs and in my case, doubly blessed I have the physical ability to to do it. This latest deal is probably symptomatic of simmering issues I should have addressed a lot sooner. (And probably some of my outrage is indeed fueled by the knowledge I have to go back to this unhappy situation in about two weeks.)  A sit down meeting with her when I am back with a follow up memo recapping our conversation should do it.

The Guardian took down Emma Keller's post. In a comment posted to the editor's explanation, she wrote: The readers' editor has said that there are inaccurate representations of Ms. Adams' illness. All of the information that I wrote about Ms. Adams was taken from her blogs or tweets. For example, Lisa Adams disputes my description of her cancer's progress, telling The Guardian in an email that she was \"only diagnosed with metastatic cancer in 2012.\" Yet on her blog she describes a different time line - which is the one I used in charting her progress. Her own language on her blog is that following a bilateral mastectomy for DCIS that was diagnosed in December 2006, she was told within some weeks that \"I did have a micro-metastasis to a lymph node.\" and that \"I actually had stage II (grade 3, the most aggressive grade) invasive ductal carcinoma that had spread to one lymph node.\" http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/16/why-article-lisa-bonchek-adams-removed?commentpage=1 Can you clarify what is meant by micro mets in this situation? (Keller contstrued this to mean Adams had mets in 2006 and this not the case.)",

(Was there not an oncologist he could have spoken with, for cryeye?) Emma Keller wrote about her  DCIS (or more accurately reconstruction) in an earlier article:  http://emmagkeller.com/blog/2012/06/my-40-day-breast-cancer-a-handful-of-atypical-cells-one-week-a-double-mastectomy-and-reconstructive-surgery-the-next-its-a-cure-but-its-brutal/ This is  Emma Keller's cached article that launched the current furor.  https://web.archive.org/web/20140109033020/http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/08/lisa-adams-tweeting-cancer-ethics As I said previously, neither Keller understands what metastatic breast cancer is. Bill Keller's implication--that people like Lisa Adams (who is in fact getting standard of care)--is clutching at straws shows just how poorly understood this disease is. And comparing a 79 year old man's cancer to that of a 40-something mom is just idiotic. I think if you have been on this board, you've read about people with bad bone pain and pleural effusion. While these are serious--and certainly painful things--they are not--as Emma Keller suggests--signs that someone is on their deathbed.  Keller notes that Adams is constantly tweeting--and indeed, most of it is about cancer related things. Some are how she is feeling at that moment, some are are reflections on cancer, living with cancer, etc.  Keller calls this \"Dying out loud.\" Because she doesn't quite \"get\" MBC, Keller suggested Adams is spending her final days obsessively tweeting. I don't think that is the case. Adams was in the hospital to get rads for pain relief. If I were in her place, I probably would tweet, if I could, for the company. On the other hand, I just couldn't keep pumping out updates about myself and dropping pearls of wisdom--that is just not me. I like to take time to absorb any news on my own. I am fortunate I really don't have a lot of news to share. It does bother me when I see someone, who I kind of feel overstates their treatment for attention/pity etc. I don't mean Adams. There is one person who posts occasional blog updates and has essentially the same treatment as me Femara and Zometa. (Tho I switched to xgeva.) Ok, as we know Zometa is given as an infusion and usually takes 20-30 minutes and generally doesn't have a lot of SE after the first one. Does this woman miss a single opportunity to post pictures of herself hooked up to an IV? Nope! And, because her non-Stage IV friends aren't that savvy, I am sure they think she is getting chemo, poor thing. That just bugs me as it seems dishonest and insulting to those who ARE having some pretty tough treatments.",

You know the special Sloan Kettering back room for loyal customers..... Anyone familiar with MBC could quickly discern Adams' treatment is standard of care--NOT \"Heroic Measures\" as Keller describes them.  I commend Lisa B. Adams for sharing her story. I frankly would be uncomfortable with that level of sharing, but I respect that we are all different. I also wish Lisa would use her platform  to say something for those who don't have her means. If she finds things difficult, what about those don't have cleaning or childcare help or the financial ability not to work? I don't think she has considered that.  But that is her choice and I respect it.  Lisa's story is a compelling one, but it not the only one and I wish more voices were being heard. Still I am very grateful for what she is doing and I hope it brings new awareness of MBC and its treatment.",

I have been on tamoxifen (two years) and now femara (start of this year) with lupron until about a month ago and Zometa until last fall, now Xgeva. Lupron shots could sometimes leave me kinda queasy--since I was able to work from home sometimes I did. Early on I would sometimes come over with a crushing fatigue (to the point where I needed to sit down while shopping). That didn't last, would not have wanted to deal with that in a meeting or while traveling. First Zometa infusion left me feeling like I got hit by a truck, but as most will attest, first is the worst. Femara hasn't been bad for me, but some do get really bad joint pains. If a job required standing all day, that might be an issue.  I faced something of a similar issue when first dx'd. At first it was thought I was Stage 3 and would have chemo/surgery/rads. I had a big industry  confab coming up--if I could not be there, I needed to arrange coverage. I did--only to learn a week later (thank you, bone scan) I have bone mets and old tx plan was scrapped.  So I ended  up going to the event, but I was in a weird kind of limbo.  My job is generally a desk job. Overall I did not have a problem continuing to work, but I did on occasion need to take a day off or just take it easy. But most days I am ok. It is difficult for all concerned, but until you know your tx and have a little time to see how you do with it, you won't know. From my experience, my advice is don't rush to make a pronouncement--wait until you know what is going on.  While most employers are subject to FMLA, the law may not apply to very small companies.

As my one surgeon put it: no one dies of bone mets (which is not say that they are great or a walk in the park). Just that organ mets are a different kettle of fish. I know someday I will no longer have bone-only disease but this is where I am today.  I have never been NED but I have been stable (nothing got bigger or smaller; disease stayed the same). Stable is just as good (or at least for me). Doctors talk about disease tempo--mine would be slow--hasn't done too much. It was \"good\" that there was a long time between your first dx and then the mets. As you have some treatment under your belt and the disease seems to be regressing this is a \"good\" sign. Another factor is how you feel in general--if you feel pretty good, good energy, etc. that is a \"good\" sign.  I also pressed my oncologist for some kind o f prognosis but she didn't give one.

Most focus on \"the cure,\" she says, with brave women describing how they beat a fearsome disease. Lange doesn't expect to beat breast cancer. There is no cure for breast cancer that has metastasized, or spread to other organs; most patients survive just two to three years. \"Metastatic breast cancer patients represent the early-stage breast cancer survivor's biggest fear,\" says Lange, 48, of Annapolis, Md., whose cancer relapsed five years ago. She says she was recently asked to tell her story to a breast cancer group. \"When I got to the part about metastasis, people started squirming.\" Some groups ask women not to reveal that their disease has spread, says Dian \"C.J.\" Corneliussen-James, 60, who has lived five years with metastatic disease. \"That means the people with the worst situation have no support.\" Resources for women with aggressive or advanced breast cancer Inflammatory Breast Cancer Help and Support Metastatic Breast Cancer Network Metavivo National Breast Cancer Coalition At other events, metastatic patients \"hear about women who are surviving and celebrating, but they are women who every day have to summon the strength to overcome fatigue and all the other side-effects,\" says Karen Neyer, an oncology social worker with the Cancer Support Community. \"They're living with cancer and going on with their lives every day.\" Much of the recent discussion of \"pink fatigue,\" including the backlash against what's become known as \"Pinktober\" and \"pinkwashing,\" has come from women with metastatic disease. Most October breast cancer events - from fundraisers to walks, runs and relays - are \"all full of hope,\" says Sally Drees, 42, of Des Moines, Iowa. [article continues]",

There are few jobs and everyone knows my story, so I doubt a competitor would offer a fulltime job. Given the lousy economy/struggling industry, this job stopped being fun a long time ago. But I felt somewhat trapped---realistically, I won't find a job that pays my current salary and provides the same flexibility. So I stayed.  I guess what I am hoping to do is possibly parlay some of my volunteer experience (some with breast cancer related nonprofits as well as some misc. communications work for my high school) into a new job. I don't know what that job will be...but it will be a new challenge which sounds good at this point.   I think the main thing for me is to have some projects (paid or not) lined up. Left to my own devices, I could easily spend my days watching \"I Love Lucy\" reruns... Sometimes so many choices can be overwhelming. I feel so fortunate to have options and just to feel good.  It's been ages since I wrote a resume. Listing my job(s) are easy, but describing my accomplishments will take longer--haven't thought about it in awhile.  I think I will enjoy a little break, but when I was off for my surgery and rads last year, I could see how isolating being home/working at home could be. ",

She responded back that most continue to work and she's not sure I would qualify for disability. (My scans and CT have been stable for last two sets of scans. My low volume of bone mets isn't doing much.)  Hmmm...my understanding is that Stage IV is Stage IV for disability purposes. Am I wrong?

Does my oncologist even have any say in determining if I am disabled? I thought I essentially had to show evidence of a Stage IV diagnosis, which I do have.

The SS person said she would advise sending as much as possible to support the case.  The bottomline is, I can submit my own application. While it is possible SS could always deny my claim, I can make my own case, I don't have to have my doctor's blessing/cooperation.

I think some of this info is used more for someone who has an early stage cancer to maybe give an idea of recurrence odds.  I also think you have to look at what's happened to you over the year of your treatment. If your cancer was super aggressive your experience would probably reflect that.   Here's an explanation of how the scoring works. (Sounds like figure skating!) http://www.oncolink.org/types/article.cfm?c=3&s=5&ss=838&id=9588&p=2 Histological Grade Histological grade is reported using the \"Bloom Richardson Scale\" or \"Nottingham Score\". It is a combination of nuclear grade, mitotic rate, and tubule formation, which are characteristics of the tumor cells seen under a microscope that predict its aggressiveness. Now, this scoring system is very detailed and usually does not affect treatment decisions, so it is not particularly helpful in the big picture. However, you will see it on the report and may be interested in what it means. In general, high grade tumors are more likely to recur when compared to low grade tumors. * Nuclear Grade: a score is given from 1 to 3, based on the appearance of the nucleus of the cancer cells, with 1 being the closest to normal cells (better), 3 being the most variation (worse). * Mitotic Rate: describes how quickly the cancer cells are multiplying or dividing using a 1 to 3 scale, 1 being the slowest, 3 the most rapid. * Tubule formation: this score represents the percent of cancer cells that are in tubule formation. A score of 1 means greater than 75% of cells are in tubule formation (better), a score of 3 is used when less than 10% of cells are in tubule formation (worse), a score of 2 is in between 10 and 75%. The three scores are then combined for a total score between 3 (1+1+1) and 9 (3+3+3). This score translates to a histological grade. You may see the three values and total score or just the final grade. * Score of 3,4 or 5: Well differentiated or low grade (Grade 1) * Score of 6 or 7: Moderately differentiated or intermediate grade (Grade 2) * Score of 8 or 9: Poorly differentiated or high grade (Grade 3)",

(The campaign is really well done, it's not due to that at all) My FB friends are a weird hybrid of actual friends and family as well as many acquaintances from my job. People who know me well do know I have Stage IV breast cancer. But there are probably a lot of people in the industry I work in who don't and some of them are among my FB friends. I don't mind that they know, I just dread the thought of having to talk about my health with people I don't know well and in some cases hardly at all. Like the Divine Miss M, I seldom post about my own BC on FB The other reason I didn't repost....I have a friend from a prior job--I think her mom had early stage breast cancer. My friend did a 3 day walk and sent constant bulletins, fundraising messages etc. This was shortly after I was diagnosed and I would concede my anti pink sentiment was at an all time high. I did support my friend's walk, but a few weeks later, I sent her a note telling her of my dx and how MBC differs from early stage bc. I wasn't a jerk or self righteous, I just felt like I had to tell her it's a different world. To her credit, my friend has subsequently done fundraisers for Metavivor and posts messages about the importance of research for Stage IV breast cancer. But (and as Pee Wee Herman would say everyone has a big but...) this past October she kind of went to the extreme on MBC FB postings. While very well inentioned, some of the posting had the undertone of \"Dear Ignorant Friends I Am Going to Make You Feel Really, Really Bad on Behalf of the 150,000 US People Who Are Ultimately Gonna Die From Breast Cancer...\" I feared that my FB support for Metavivor would be perceived as invitation for her to get back on the lecture circuit.....",

But I am not a pet person--I am allergic to cats (and most dogs). When I was five our neighbor's dog (a chihuahua no less) nipped me and I guess I have always been afraid of dogs. I am the youngest of seven kids--and as you noted, a twin. My mother's family was Jewish but not religious. As a college student, she had some Catholic friends, and on her own, converted to Catholicism. My mom, then an art student from Chicago, was in Mexico sketching/researching when she met my father, a Bostonian in the late 1950s. My father was a WW 2 vet as well as an Atomic Vet (at the Nevada proving grounds when atomic weapons were being tested). After my parents married, they soon started their family. Although I have six siblings, we are all practically the same age, only a few years between oldest and youngest. In my case I have an \"Irish triplet,\" one of my brothers is not quite a year older than me and my twin brother. So there were three of us in the same grade. I was pretty shy growing up. I am close to all my siblings, they are all great people.  My father worked an insurance company--he was a creative guy and probably very bored with his job, but those were the days of  job security and he did work for this company his entire life and it did provide a pension. My parents were both family oriented--they always came to our sporting events, took in an interest in all that we did and we did eat dinner as family virtually every night.  Neither of my parents drove. We did not have a car until I was in 7th or 8th grade and one of my older brothers was driving. We lived in small town in Northern IL--there wasn't a lot of public transportation (a bus which served the neighboring communities). So we did a lot of walking. Airlines hadn't been deregulated when I was growing up in the 1970s. Our family took one trip for my grandparents' anniversary--it was very exciting to get on a plane--but I guess did wonder what it would be like to be the Brady Bunch and go on a car trip. (We also did not have a dishwasher--imagine if Alice was around to do all the chores!) My parents did not let us watch much TV--but we managed to keep up with \"Happy Days\" and whatever the \"cool\" shows of the day were on the sly. So far I am sure my family sounds like some offshoot of an Amish sect--no car, no TV, etc. but it wasn't like that. Here's a picture of my famiy back in the day.  My mom was dx'd with inflammatory breast cancer when I was 15 and she died a few weeks after three of us graduated from high school (and an older brother graduated from college). I wish my mom had a board like this because she must have felt very isolated--there were no real resources then--even for people with early stage breast cancer. When I was dx'd with MBC, I thought of my mom and I feared I would have the pain and aggressive disease she did. (I don't, but I didn't realize that at first.) Altho my mom had cancer, my cancer is not considered heriditary--I don't have the BRCA1/2 mutation. (Given that my mom was dx'd when she was 51 and I was dx'd when I was 43, I think there is probably a mutation we just don't know about at this point...) My father, a lifelong smoker, died of bladder cancer in his early 70s.  2. I work full-time. I edit a trade magazine (as distinct from a consumer magazine, a trade magazine is free to \"qualified\" subscribers in that profession). I can't say I have limitations--just time off to go to appointments. I had surgery and rads and then an ooph, so I took time off for that. I do notice I get tired more easily at times, but overall, I can't say I have restrictions. I don't know what I would do if I wasn't working. Sometimes I think I would like not working but it could just be those are times when I am overdue for a vacation... I have traveled at lot for my job, but usually with friends in the industry. I wouldn't care to travel alone. I do volunteer with MBCN.org, mostly writing related projects.  I do have a lot of nieces and nephews--I would probably go to more soccer games.   3. I have always liked to read. Musa Mayer's book  (now out of print, but my cancer center had it) and Lilly Shockney's book provided excellent overviews. Musa had a blog post (she is now on FB) and BCMets.org   where she suggested people read the Third Concensus on the Medical Treatment of Metastatic Breast Cancer http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/content/20/11/1771.ful. As a technical writer, I guess I have become accustomed to looking for plain English among mountains of jargon. So I wasn't intimidated by what I didn't understand. I knew somewhere there must be a clear explanation. I did not understand the Third Concensus at first, but after I had \"been around\" a litte while, I could make sense of it.  People have different learning styles. (I don't have the patience to watch videos, but if that works better for you, there are good ones on YouTube, MBCN, etc.) Also, if you have an unusual subtype (triple negative, triple positive, inflammatory, etc etc) there are some associations and websites spefically dedicated to those treatments, take a look. 4. Hmmmm...not sure there is a typical day. Until last fall, I worked downtown. So I would get up and depending on the time of year/weather, I might go for a walk. Upon returning home, I would get ready for work and then take the train downtown. About a 25-minute train ride. I used to be someone who would read the morning paper, but now I read it online. I also like my coffee in the morning, but just one cup. Work is somewhat cyclical--Mondays are typically busy. Generally I will have two very hectic weeks.  I am not a big TV watcher--but I do get sucked into \"Law & Order\" reruns and classic shows as seen on MeTV, etc. I am not an outdoorsy person (in terms of camping, etc) but I am a big walker--I loved to walk along the Chicago River and Lake Michigan when I was downtown. I have an affinity for junk--I do stop at garage sales, thrift stores, antique stores--I try to do more looking than buying. My Kindle/iPad are awesome but I still have way too many books just sitting around. After I graduated from college I spent some time working in a book store--my father said this was like hiring an alcoholic to work in a liquor store--I would say that was correct! 5. I am very fortunate, I really don't have any physical complaints. I think for me it is a mental challenge--I can't believe this is happening to me--I can't believe I will always be dealing with this. I think my attitude flucuates--right now I really don't have much going on. As I think everyone does, I get on edge when going for scans.  Thanks for asking. Who will be next???",

      "Content": "Oct 21, 2012 07:23PM EnglishMajor wrote: SonnyB, as I noted on the Patch site: Earlier this year, Dartmouth professors published a paper in a reputable medical journal criticizing a Susan G. Komen ad campaign for citing the same statistics mentioned in the above article. As CNN reported: Professors Steven Woloshin and Lisa Schwartz at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice say the foundation overstated the benefits of the procedure and totally ignored the risks. \"The ad implies that mammograms have a huge effect, but the only evidence that they use is the five-year survival rate for breast cancer when caught early is 98% and when it's not, 23%,\" Woloshin said. \"The problem is that in the context of screening survival, statistics are meaningless.\" \"To make an informed decision, you not only have to know the benefits you have to know the harm. And the ad does not say anything about harm, it just gives you this exaggerated benefit statistic,\" Woloshin said... ...Woloshin and Schwartz write a series that highlights exaggerations, distortions and selective reporting in advertising, news stories and medical journals that are misleading. They say the problem in Komen's case is using survival statistics to determine the benefit of screening. \"There is no correlation between changes in survival and changes in how many people die.\" Woloshin said. \"Twenty to 50% of women who get screened every year end up having at least one false alarm over 10 years, and 5-20% actually end up having to have a biopsy to rule out cancer. \"The most important harm is overdiagnosis -- screening can find cancers that were never destined to cause harm because it grows so slowly or can go away on its own,\" he said. \"It would never have harmed you, you would never have known about it and you would have lived your whole life and died from something else. These people get treated. They get radiation, chemotherapy, surgery and it's all unnecessary. \" Woloshin also says the Komen ad ignores the problems with screening. He says for every life saved by screening two to 10 women are 'overdiagnosed', suffer anxiety and undergo unnecessary radiation, chemotherapy or surgery. He said in the end, it all boils down to this: \"You can't make a good decision unless you have the basic facts. It exaggerated the benefit and it ignored the harm.\" But Komen, the world's largest breast cancer charity, says while mammography isn't perfect, it's still the best detection tool available. \"We have long advocated for women to be informed about the benefits and risks of early detection and treatment,\" said Chandini Portteus, Komen's vice president of research, evaluation and scientific programs. \"The numbers are not in question. Early detection allows for early treatment, which gives women the best chance of surviving breast cancer.\" Since its inception in 1982, the organization -- creator of the \"pink ribbon,\" a symbol of breast cancer awareness and the official symbol of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month -- has invested nearly $2 billion in research. \"We've said for years that science has to do better, which is why Komen is putting millions of dollars into research to detect breast cancer before symptoms start -- through biomarkers, for example,\" said Portteus. \"Komen also is funding research to help accurately predict which tumors will spread and which won't. While we invest in getting those answers, we think it's simply irresponsible to effectively discourage women from taking steps to know what's going on with their health.\" Portteus said Komen encourages women to work with their health care providers to find out what's right for them. But according to Woloshin, a recent survey he and his colleagues conducted showed even doctors mistake improved survival as proof that screening saves lives. \"The survival statistics are confusing for doctors, too,\" he said. \"This is a real communication problem that doctors and patients alike face, so whenever you hear about survival statistics in the context of screening, you should ignore them.

When asked about this, NCI's media contact responded: \"Thank you for your interest in NCI and the SEER Program. The SEER Program recognizes the importance of understanding and capturing disease progression and recurrence. You are correct in saying that SEER records information, including stage, at the time of diagnosis and follows men and women who have been diagnosed with cancer to estimate survival. Mortality vs. Survival: Mortality numbers tell the story more precisely than survival numbers, and screening skews the survival numbers. The more we screen, the more we diagnose and treat women with breast cancers that would not have been a threat to their lives (some DCIS, other slow growing invasive breast cancers, and others that are dormant or regressive); so it looks like survival for early stage breast cancer is 98 percent.  This is only a 5-year survival number\u2014and includes the 20-30 percent of women who will have recurrence and may die of the disease later.  For Stage II and III, one-half to two-thirds will develop metastatic disease within five years and they are included in the 5-year survival statistic.  Women die of metastatic disease, not primary breast cancer. As the National Cancer Institute explains thoroughly on its website: But that is a lifetime risk. Risk increases with age, so the NCI provides a more helpful way of looking at it for women of different ages: Note that NCI statistics are \"five-year relative survival\": (\"The survival statistics presented here are based on relative survival, which measures the survival of the cancer patients in comparison to the general population to estimate the effect of cancer.\") http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/breast.html#survival",

The 127 races that are held by Komen affiliates around the world raise a lot of money--yes. And 75 percent of those funds stay in the community where they were raised to be used on all kinds of breast cancer related needs. Each affiliate sets its own guidelines, but they award grants in their area to non-profits, including hospitals, that provide such services as screening, diagnostics, and treatment as well as programs to educate and raise awareness. Some fund services such as expenses for survivors like transportation to treatment. In the '90s I was founding president of the board of two nonprofits in Dallas that addressed breast cancer. The first, a group called the Bridge Breast Network, assists uninsured women with diagnosis and treatment. We started the group with funding from memorials for my mother, who died of breast cancer in 1992, and then we had the very arduous task of fund raising for a start up that provided medical care for women with breast cancer. Had it not been for the Dallas Affiliate of Komen, we would never have gotten off the ground. And the women we served--all of whom did not have insurance and many of whom were minority--would not have had treatment. When we started Gilda's Club North Texas, the funding also came, albeit at lower amounts because we had to prove the numbers of our members that were breast cancer survivors. Komen affiliates do their homework on every grant. The other 25 percent of the money raised by the Komen affiliates goes back to Komen National and is directed to research - all of it. So where does the money come from to run the organization: corporate sponsors.[blog continues]",

I had a pretty easy time--no nodes or recon so that significantly speeded recovery time. I didn't have much pain and felt pretty good afterwords, all things considered. Again, my prodedure was pretty minimal and everyone is different. I was very modestly endowed to begin with. I found I didn't use the surgical camisole--support was not an issue. (I was glad to have the option, tho.) I only had one drain (an advantage of being on the small side...) I didn't have any difficulties with my arm as no nodes were taken. I had rads a few weeks after the surgery--a bra would have been uncomfortable, I could get by with a tank top.  Most insurance will cover the cost of the surgical camisole, prothesis, etc. My treatment center has an \"image center\" where they fit and dispense these. ",

But I would say MBC research is underfunded.  Here is July 2010 commentary from Kathy Miller:  Hi, Kathy Miller with Indiana University, back with another installment of our Medscape video oncology blog. Today it is another convergence of 2 seemingly unrelated issues that got me thinking. I spent a long time last night reviewing grants that have been just submitted, or rather, grant proposals, just submitted to the Komen Foundation, and there were some truly fabulous ideas there, really innovative ideas that might be wrong, but if they are right, have the potential to lead to really major improvements for our patients. And I kept getting more and more frustrated as I was reading these proposals, realizing that there simply is not enough funding to support all of the proposals that would really be worth funding, and that should be given the chance to be tested. And this morning, I came in early to see a patient before my usual clinic started -- a delightful young woman with advanced metastatic disease who was expressing her disappointment to me that with all the funding available for cancer research, that from her perspective, we have made very little progress. I have to say on one hand, that I disagree with her that we have made little progress. We have made some major progress in important areas over the past decade. But from her perspective, she is right: we don't have anything that is going to cure her of this breast cancer. She has done everything we have asked her to do from the time of her early diagnosis, and she knows she is going to die from this breast cancer and that is going to happen pretty soon. But it did get me thinking: is she right about the amount of funding? And it got me to look at the actual numbers. So here are 2 numbers for you to ponder and for you to think about the next time a patient of yours asks you about the lack of progress with the huge amount of funding. If you combine all of the funding for cancer research in this country from all sources (private foundations, pharmaceutical companies, the US government), and lump them all together, it comes to just under 69 cents per person per week for a disease that is consistently one of the most frightening, one of the most deadly diseases, one that will affect nearly half of us directly, and all of us indirectly. Just under 69 cents per week per person. Let me put that number in perspective for you. That is roughly one-sixth of what we, as a nation, spend on soft drinks. It is roughly one-third of the tobacco industry's advertising budget. So when you wonder why progress is not as quick as we would hope, the funding is not that great, and in comparison with other things that we freely spend money on that are not nearly so important or maybe frankly harmful, it puts the problem in a whole new light. It is really a problem of commitment and willingness to fund the endeavor in the necessary way to make progress. Something for us all to think about the next time we go to the vending machine and get our favorite soft drink.",

While we know, for example, that smoking can cause cancer, many people who smoked live to a good old age. And some who didn't died well before their time.  Consider Dana Reeve, Christopher \"Superman\" Reeve's wife. She died of lung cancer--she was not a smoker. I think she probably took excellent care of herself. Another good example is Linda McCartney, Paul McCartney's wife. Linda was a passionate vegetarian--at a time when it wasn't fashionable to be one. I am sure she took excellent care of herself--and she still got breast cancer.  There is a perception among some people that people get metastatic breast cancer because they did something wrong--ate or drank the wrong things, etc. etc. But on this board, as you will see, cancer doesn't care about gold stars in going to the gym or eating kale--it doesn't discriminate.  On the other hand, I would never take a \"why bother\" approach. We should be good to ourselves and take care of ourselves. But we can't take cancer as a personal failing--because it is not. It is a cellular disease. In some cases, we have inherited faulty genes in other cases, there may be environmental factors at work. Chin up, grasshopper!",

And of course, people have different experiences, what was easy for one woman may prove painful for another.  That being said... I had a left mx no recon followed by 30 rads because I had a close margin. I had a  big tumor and small breast, so  lumpectomy wasn't an option. I was pretty flat to begin with so balance and symmetry were not an issue for me. I wasn't offered recon, but wouldn't have opted for it. Because I was small to begin with, the mx did not make a huge difference in my shape. I was glad in retrospect to be recovering only from the simple mx vs. recon. which would taken a longer time.  Radiation made me tired toward the end. My skin held up pretty well, altho that is not the case for everyone. There is also the time commitment---having to go 30 consecutive days for tx (less weekends) can cramp your style. The tx is quick, but, like a suspect on a cop show, you can't leave town (well, only on weekends).... This was the right decision for me, good luck with your choice! ",

No trial experience here, but for you and others, here's some info on an assn. created by Darby Steadman, herself a Stage IV bc patient, that helps with clinical trial expenses.  Darby's participation in Dr. Emens' breast cancer vaccine trial forever changed her perspective on medicine, convincing her of the importance of scientific research in the war on cancer. The result is Darby's passion for supporting patients who, like her, have chosen experimental treatment for their disease. The truth is that Darby's participation in this trial will likely not benefit her at all. She chose to participate in the trial hoping that her daughter will never face the same disease that both Darby and her mother have faced. Darby will use her foundation to promote scientific discovery and help facilitate access to experimental treatment for patients who otherwise could not afford it. The ability of our scientists to develop cutting edge clinical treatments will stagnate unless they can recruit and retain study patients, a process called accrual. Only then can our medical community put into practice the promising results of research such as Dr. Emens' vaccine work. Read more about the accrual crisis from the New York Times. Read more about the accrual crisis from the Wall Street Journal.",

There are some women here with unknown primaries whose cancer has spread, they can offer a better explanation.  Sometimes it does happen that a woman will have breast cancer which can't be seen in her breast but has spread nonetheless.  I would hazard to guess this is because cancer must have divided into millions of cells before we can see it, even with today's soposticated imaging devices. (I believe cancer must be 7mm or so before it can be seen.) At any rate, it's likely your friend has cancer in her breast, it just isn't detectable. Hope this helps.

Also:  If you are going to a treatment center, there should be a social worker who will know the best resources. If you haven't done so, tell your oncologist your concerns. This is an important part of your total health picture. Your doctor should know what is on your mind.  Hang in there. http://gallery.patientadvocate.org/requests/paf_cm_request.php http://www.patientadvocate.org/help.php?p=480#one What does PAF do? Patient Advocate Foundation is a national non-profit organization that serves as an active liaison between the patient and their insurer, employer and/or creditors to resolve insurance, job retention and/or debt crisis matters relative to their diagnosis through case managers, doctors and attorneys. Patient Advocate Foundation seeks to safeguard patients through effective mediation assuring access to care, maintenance of employment and preservation of their financial stability. Are your services free? Yes. Patient Advocate Foundation provides case management services, educational materials and live chat services at no charge to patients. How can I get case management assistance? If you have a chronic, debilitating or life threatening illness and would like to have direct communication with a member of PAF Patient Services, please call us at 800-532-5274. We have access to a wide variety of resources and can offer intervention if necessary. Do you offer financial assistance? We do not offer direct financial assistance. Please refer to our website www.patientadvocate.org for resources that may benefit you. You may search within \"The National Financial Resources Guidebook\" for National Resources, Government Resources and State-specific Resources. If you are in need of co-pay assistance, please contact our Co-Pay Relief Program at 1-866-512-3861. Can you help with transportation? Please refer to our website www.patientadvocate.org for resources that may benefit you. You may search within \"The National Financial Resources Guidebook\" for National Resources, Government Resources and State-specific Resources. Where can I get financial assistance for my living expenses such as rent, utilities and food? Please refer to our website www.patientadvocate.org for resources that may benefit you. You may search within \"The National Financial Resources Guidebook\" for National Resources, Government Resources and State-specific Resources. How can I get help with funeral expenses? If your loved one had no assets and was eligible for public assistance, you should contact either the Social Services/Medicaid case worker or Social Services General information to inquire about indigent funeral assistance. If he/she was a Veteran, you should contact the Veterans Administration to inquire about available benefits. You may also contact the Social Security Administration for assistance. If you are unsure of how to proceed, many funeral homes have access to information regarding the availability of state or local assistance. How can I get insurance if I have a pre-existing condition? You may visit www.healthinsurance.org/riskpo... to determine whether the state in which you reside offers a State Comprehensive Health Insurance Program also called a \"risk pool\". These programs offer access to health insurance for patients who are unable to obtain coverage elsewhere. Also, be sure to elect COBRA coverage when leaving an employer in order to prevent a gap in insurance coverage. If there has been no break in coverage and your spouse has insurance available through his or her employer, you should be able to access this benefit because of your 'qualifying event.'",

Some are drawn in through their love of cancer science. Cancer has always been something like a cobra to those who study it: dangerous and beautiful and endlessly fascinating. Cancer is a universe. One can spend an entire life exploring it without ever getting bored, for the biology of cancer is the biology of life. Some doctors are inspired by a great teacher. Medicine is still a profession dominated by old-world apprenticeships, where a mentor's passion can be transmitted to a new generation. I have known several oncologists whose careers turned on chance encounters with inspiring professors. Others get there by way of their patients. I'm one of these. When I was a resident, cancer patients were the ones who touched my heart. In fact, I can remember the very moment I started my path to becoming an oncologist. [continues...]",

Among them: * Legal Information Network for Cancer (LINC, www.cancerlinc.org, 877-644-5462). Services include explanation of insurance benefits and help with appeal for coverage denial; the getting of public benefits such as Medicaid or Social Security Disability, management of debt, including negotiation to ward off collections, arrangements for care and custody of children. * LegalHealth at the New York Legal Assistance Group has legal clinics for low-income patients in the New York area dealing with job and other issues, and other services (www.nylag.org, 212-613-5095). * Cancer Legal Resource Center (www.disabilityrightslegalcenter.org, 866-843-2572) in Los Angeles offers nationwide assistance with job and health insurance related issues. * The Patient Advocate Foundation (www.patientadvocate.org, 800-532-5274) offers counseling as well as referrals for cancer patients dealing with job discrimination, insurance issues and other problems. Payment for Treatments-- A number of nonprofit organizations can help with financial assistance when treatment expenses for cancer are overwhelming. A sampling: * CancerCare (www.cancercare.org, 800-813-4673), offers financial assistance in the form of limited grants for certain treatment expenses. Services also include practical help and support via the free phone line or the website. * National Marrow Donor Program (www.marrow.org, 888-999-6743) has a patient assistance program that helps with costs for searching the donor program registry and some post-transplant costs. * The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society (www.leukemia-lymphoma.org, 800-955-4572) offers some financial aid to patients with leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma or multiple myeloma who qualify as needing the assistance. * The Patient Advocate Foundation (www.patientadvocate.org, 800-532-5274) also sponsors a Co-Pay Relief program for qualified patients. * The Federal Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Bureau of Primary Health Care has health centers nationwide that provide health care based on ability to pay. To locate a health center, visit the web page at http://ask.hrsa.gov/pc. Payment for Medications-- Relief from the high costs of medications is often needed. Among the organizations that help: * NeedyMeds, at www.needymeds.com, is a nonprofit that helps patients by referring them to patient assistance programs to help with medication costs. * Patient assistance programs are offered by some pharmaceutical companies. To find them, ask your doctor or social worker or find the drug's manufacturer and visit the company site. Look for a section titled \"patience assistance programs\" or similar wording. Payment for Transportation and Lodging * Hope Lodge is a housing program supported by the American Cancer Society, providing free housing on a temporary basis for cancer patients undergoing treatment. For information and a listing of lodges, visit the web site at www.cancer.org/docroot/subsite... or call 800-227-2345. * Road to Recovery, another ACS program, offers transportation to and from treatments for cancer patients.

Such research takes longer to accomplish and the predictability of success is shaky. 2. They are Getting Away with It.  Cancer organizations have used token advances to claim they are making great strides forward with metastatic cancer.  The advances they speak of are rare and normally involve extending life at best for several weeks or months, but this is not made public.  Even those who know the truth keep giving, including some of those dying of the disease.  They are caught up by the glamour, the big names and the enticing events.   There is no need to take the difficult road. 3. Money .. Money .. Money.  Metastatic cancer research is enormously expensive, especially if sufficient models (animal or otherwise), which are critical to much of the research, are to be developed.  What would METAvivor do if money were not an issue?  No question there.  We would convene a conference and bring together the world's premier, career metastasis researchers to develop a 20-year collaborative plan aimed at eradicating death from stage IV breast cancer.  We know this is possible .. we need only the funding.",

(For those outside the US, the Onion is a parody website/newspaper. This is a spoof...) Man With Friend With Cancer 'Going Through A Rough Time'         October 12, 2005  |                ISSUE 41 BISMARCK, ND-Three months ago, Mark Sennis received the news that everyone dreads: Ben Murphy, a friend and coworker with whom he \"occasionally went out to lunch,\" had been diagnosed with cancer. Sennis, who has been suffering from having a friend with cancer since July. \"You never think you're going to be the one,\" Sennis said. \"At first, I remember thinking, 'How can this be happening to me? What have I done to deserve to have a friend with cancer?'\" Sennis, who has known Murphy since they started working in the same department at Motorola in 2003, said having a friend with cancer  is \"a life-altering experience.\" \"People ask me how I'm doing, and I say, 'I'm scared and I'm angry,'\" Sennis said. \"Unless you've personally experienced the pain and hardship that comes with having a coworker you're fairly close to get cancer, you wouldn't understand.\" Sennis said that, while it initially seemed like \"life had come to an end,\" he \"made the decision to keep living.\" \"One thing I've learned in all this is that life goes on,\" Sennis said. \"Well, maybe not for Ben. But for me. The only thing I can do is take it one day at a time.\" Sennis said he doesn't want people feeling sorry for him. \"A lot of my friends start to say 'I have a friend who's just been fired,' or 'I have a friend who tore a tendon,'\" Sennis said. \"Then, they realize that I have a friend with cancer, and they get quiet, like they think they can't discuss their problems with me anymore. I just want people to treat me like normal.\" Sennis said he wishes he'd appreciated the good times he enjoyed with his friends before he got the news. \"You never understand what you have until your friend's cancer takes it away,\" Sennis said. \"Like, I used to complain about having to go to Wednesday Wings with the guys from sales, but last week we had to cancel because Ben was getting a bone-marrow biopsy, so I sat at home alone all night.\" \"It was a pretty depressing picture,\" he added. Sennis said chemotherapy has been particularly hard for him. \"Ever since the chemo started, it's been a whole other story,\" Sennis said. \"I had to spend a good part of my Sunday hanging out in the waiting room last week. I was so exhausted I could barely move.\" \"Just try finding something decent to eat out there,\" Sennis added. \"I ate a sandwich from the hospital deli, and the bread was, like, Wonderbread, and the turkey tasted terrible, like it was day-old or something.\" Sennis said that, ironically, the presence of Murphy's family made the situation more difficult.\" I'm going through an emotional time,\" Sennis said. \"Ben's entire family was the last thing I needed at the hospital. Do you realize how hard it is to talk to people you don't know at all?\" Sennis added: \"The hardest part was talking to Ben's girlfriend. I never liked her, but because of Ben, I had to go through these awkward conversations. 'How many more chemo sessions does Ben have?' 'Is Ben keeping down his food?' It was really hard.\" Sennis said his struggle has made him reconsider his relationship with God. \"I wonder why God would do this to me,\" Sennis said. \"It's like God is punishing me for something by giving cancer to a friend of mine.\" Due to the adversity he has faced, Sennis said he has had to take special care of himself. \"I don't consider giving up an option,\" Sennis said. \"So, for the past two months, twice a week, I've been treating myself to a massage. It's expensive, but it's the least I can do for myself as I go through this really tough time.\" Added Sennis: \"I'm not going to let Ben's cancer beat me.\"",

I really like Sach's response: I agree that one of the most common reactions people have to difficulties is to say, \"Oh, you think you had it bad? Well, let me tell you a story.\"That misses the entire point. I've used this kind of trivial example with people. If you're waiting at a bus stop, and it's freezing cold and you're shivering, the fact that the person next to you is shivering doesn't make you warmer. It's a complete insensitivity to try to distract your attention from the difficulty that you're having so that you can worry about somebody else. They're compounding your problem. Not only are they imposing on you a lack of sympathy, but they're also suggesting to you that you ought to be sympathetic to somebody else when you're in the least appropriate position to do that. I'm not sure it's suitable for everybody - I don't have a great deal of patience for people who act that way - but I tell them, \"That's really not very helpful to me to know about somebody else at this time, because I have very big problems also, and a lumpectomy is no trivial matter, because cancer is serious business.\"",

Plus, when she says \"More people are living with breast cancer than dying from it,\" that may be technically true--but it does not change the price of beans for people living with MBC.  Incidence has risen during the past 20 years from 1 in 11 to 1 in 8, now leveling off; mortality has declined slightly Note that stage IV breast cancer-the cancer that is lethal-has stayed the same; screening and improved treatment has not changed this. Why numbers make it seem like we've made more progress than we have: Mortality vs. Survival Mortality numbers tell the story more precisely than survival numbers, and screening skews the survival numbers. The more we screen, the more we diagnose and treat women with breast cancers that would not have been a threat to their lives (some DCIS, other slow growing invasive breast cancers, and others that are dormant or regressive); so it looks like survival for early stage breast cancer is 98 percent. This is only a 5-year survival number-and includes the 20-30 percent of women who will have recurrence and may die of the disease later. For Stage II and III, one-half to two-thirds will develop metastatic disease within five years and they are included in the 5-year survival statistic. Women (and men) die of metastatic disease, not primary breast cancer. Source: http://www.breastcancerdeadline2020.org/homepage.html",

(Single people also attend, it's not couples therapy per se.) Anyhow, maybe that's an option--if you position it as you want to go and maybe he could be there for support?  There's also a group called Immerman's Angels (www.imermanangels.org/index.ph). They match cancer patients with each other--they put you in contact with someone with a similar diagnosis (i.e. Stage IV vs. DCIS) and age, etc.. I was kind of dubious that this would do anything for me but I thought what the hey? So I filled out the online form. On the one hand, the woman I was \"matched\" with was different from me--grew up in Europe and a mom. But on the other hand, we had a lot in common--I know a lot of women with breast cancer, but I never talked to someone with Stage IV like me. (Tho of course I have emailed many!) I believe caregivers also can sign up for this program. It might be something you could try for yourself and see if it something your hubby would go for. ",

I had a low volume of bone mets (and still do). I didn't grasp, at first, that you can essentially have \"degreees\" of Stage IV and I was at the low end of the thermometer. I think I kind of went from a \"savor each day\" approach to a sense of false complacency. (I am glad I feel fine but I know this disease will come back, sure as the swallows return to Capistrano...) And yet I can't live on edge everyday, waiting for some part of the other shoe to drop.... Dr. Sledge at the MBCN Conference talked about disease having a tempo. Mine has been really slow---kind of hoping the same song keeps playing. I am fortunate that my treatment has been very mild to date and doesn't really restrict anything I want to do. One of the hardest things is, the longer I am here--on this board, in MBC advocacy groups, the more friends I have lost.  K-Lo, I understand your question--how do we live our lives but not get caught off guard? I don't think there is any easy answer. It will be different for each of us.  I think we have to do the little chore things that we probably should have done anyhow (for example, I made a will--which everyone should have); clean out the junk drawer, etc. They say when someone on their deathbed lingers it is often because of unresolved business--perhaps an apology that wasn't given, an \"I love you\" that went unsaid or maybe even an underwear drawer that went unsorted. . . I think anything we can do during the \"good\" times to ease stress down the road can only help. I know some people have planned their services---I am not ready to do that, but I think that is a great gift to their families.

The majority of people who develop breast cancer didn\u2019t inherit an abnormal breast cancer gene and have no family history. But about five percent of people have a genetic mutation which predisposes  them to cancer. Two abnormal genes BRCA1 (BReast CAncer gene one) and BRCA2 (BReast CAncer gene two) are associated with a higher lifetime risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer. From the NCI FAQ: A woman who inherits a harmful mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 has an increased risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer at an early age (before menopause) and often has multiple, close family members who have been diagnosed with these diseases. Harmful BRCA1 mutations may also increase a woman\u2019s risk of developing cervical, uterine, pancreatic, and colon cancer (1, 2). Harmful BRCA2 mutations may additionally increase the risk of pancreatic cancer, stomach cancer, gallbladder and bile duct cancer, and melanoma (3). All of us have BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes according to  BreastCancer.org: \u201d The function of the BRCA genes is to repair cell damage and keep breast cells growing normally. But when these genes contain abnormalities or mutations that are passed from generation to generation, the genes don\u2019t function normally and breast cancer risk increases. Abnormal BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes may account for up to 10% of all breast cancers, or 1 out of every 10 cases.\u201d Ashkenazi (Eastern European) Jews are 10 times more likely to have mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA 2 genes than the general population. Approximately 2.65 percent of the Ashkenazi Jewish population has a mutation in these genes, while only 0.2 percent of the general population carries these mutations. Again stressing that having the mutation doesn't automatically mean you will get cancer. I am of Ashenazi descent and my mom died of breast cancer in her early 50s. So testing was recommended for me. I don't have the BRCA1/2 mutation.",

ISBN: 0-679-45702-X This book describes the development of a new type of therapy for breast cancer, from the discovery of the molecular target to the completion of successful randomized, clinical trials and approval for use. It is written as the story of the triumph of an inspired clinician against great opposition, which included his own colleagues, grant-awarding agencies, and pharmaceutical companies. There is no doubt that Dennis Slamon discovered the role of the erbB2 (her2) oncogene in breast and ovarian cancer and played a major part in preclinical studies that showed that inhibition of this molecular target was worthwhile. He was also a driving force in developing and conducting clinical trials that eventually led to the pivotal randomized trials that showed therapeutic activity. Having shared conference platforms with Slamon over the years, I think that Bazell's description of him is a caricature. Several other eminent oncologists are described in a similarly superficial style. not his life story but many liked \"the biography of cancer\": http://www.amazon.com/The-Emperor-All-Maladies-Biography/dp/1439170916 ",

Contributor Andrea Markowitz seems to have collected a lot of statistics from the usual sources and combined them with howlers such as: \"Caught early, breast cancer is easily treatable and survivable\" (\"What the stages mean,\" Sept. 23). So surgery, chemo and radiation are \"easy?\" Survivable? Twenty to 30 percent of women with early stage disease will have a recurrence. Many will be Stage IV. Markowitz perpetrates the \"Treat it and Beat it\" myth. I challenge Markowitz to find any oncologist who would use the survival rate statistics she quotes. Every woman's situation is different. I don't doubt that men diagnosed with breast cancer have a difficult time. But as Markowitz notes, such cases are extremely rare. Meanwhile, not one word about women--of all ages-- with metastatic breast cancer or the 40,000 who will die this year. Markowitz could have let people know metastatic breast cancer is incurable. The goal is control and treatment is life-long.",

I encourage anyone who doesn't have the time/inclination to write their own letter to copy mine and change as they would like.  Dear Editor, Millions of people around the world are participating in various breast cancer awareness activities this month. Many of these events involve walking, running or biking for \"The Cure.\" This year, I am participating in a new campaign dedicated exclusively to raising awareness about metastatic breast cancer. It's called the \"The Virtual Rally in Support of Progression-Free Survival.\" We are asking the 150,000 women living with metastatic breast cancer to write a letter to their local news outlets. There is no cure for metastatic breast cancer aka advanced breast cancer or Stage IV. We rarely hear about the 150,000 U.S. women dealing with it. In October, it seems the spotlight is almost exclusively on women who \"beat\" cancer-not the \"metser\" who is losing her hair for the third time, or the one struggling with chronic constipation or the one who knows she won't see her daughter graduate from grade school. We don't want your money or your pity and we're not selling pink t-shirts. We just want you to know that we are here and that for us, treatment never ends. Other women HAD breast cancer. We HAVE it and we always will. We hope someday there WILL be a cure so that our daughters are spared our fate. We want people to know that: >Metastasis refers to the spread of cancer to different parts of the body, typically the bones, liver and lungs. >Treatment is lifelong and focuses on control and quality of life vs. curative intent. >About 6% to 10% of women are Stage IV from their initial diagnosis. >Early detection is not a cure. Metastatic breast cancer can occur ANY time after a woman's original diagnosis, EVEN if she was initially Stage I, II or III. >Only women with Stage 0 (noninvasive breast cancer) aren't considered to be at risk for metastatic breast cancer. >Between 20% to 30% of women initially diagnosed with regional stage disease WILL develop metastatic breast cancer. >Young women DO get metastatic breast cancer. > There are many different kinds of metastatic breast cancer. >Treatment choices for MBC are guided by hormone (ER/PR) and HER2 receptor status, location and extent of metastasis (visceral vs. nonvisceral), previous treatment and other factors. >Any breast lump, thickness or skin abnormality should be checked out. With inflammatory breast cancer, there's no lump-the breast can be red and/or itchy and the skin may have an orange-peel like appearance. >Don't use the recent mammogram controversy to postpone your first mammogram or delay your regularly scheduled exam, especially if you have a family history. >Mammograms can't detect all cancers. Trust your instinct. If something feels \"off\" insist on further diagnostic testing. >Metastatic breast cancer isn't an automatic death sentence-although most women will ultimately die of their disease, some can live long and productive lives. >There are no hard and fast prognostic statistics for metastatic breast cancer. Every woman's situation is unique. One last thing. Knowing what to say to someone with metastatic breast cancer can be difficult. It's fine to say: \"I'm so sorry that you have to face this disease. I will be thinking/praying for you. Please let me know if I can help.\" Try to avoid back-handed compliments such as: \"You are so strong, if this had to happen, you were the right person to get it because you are brave and strong,\" or \"If I had breast cancer, I would be falling apart or scared to death. You seem just fine with it.\" Those statements are akin to \"You don't sweat much for a fat person,\" and we hate them. There are many excellent online metastatic breast cancer resources. Examples include www.breastcancer.org; www.mbcnetwork.org; and www.metavivor.org. Sincerely yours, EM",

From the last part of that editorial: The news coverage has been irresponsible. In pursuit of a hot headline, reporters omitted information that might have told a complete, complex story -- or, perhaps, made viewers and readers consider whether this family's custody fight is news at all. Media reports ignored the part of the ruling in which Giordano's oncologist testified Giordano regularly skipped treatment and ignored medical advice. Her doctor said Giordano \"was making her disease into a crisis.\" According to a psychiatric evaluation from UNC, those crises make her \"unavailable to provide care to the children.\" It describes an incident in which Giordano was advised not to bring the children to the hospital because she was going to be admitted for treatment. She ignored that advice and made no arrangements for her children's care. Giordano's oncologist took the children home with her to avoid having to call Child Protective Services. The oncologist called it a \"crisis.\" Giordano told the court it was \"a great opportunity\" for the children to get to know her doctor better. There are other factors -- page after page of testimony about Giordano's infidelity, both parents' allegations of assault, inappropriate comments to their children, and a lack of healthy boundaries between both parents' emotional lives and their children. The news coverage has been inexcusably sloppy, thoughtless and one-sided -- the opposite of good journalism. The chase for a provoctive story has exploited viewers, readers and, most horribly, the 6- and 11-year-old children whose parents' custody fight is now a matter of global gossip.

You may already have done so, but it is a good idea, to summarize your medical history in timeline form. As Joe Friday used, to say, \"Just the facts, ma'am\": date of relevant procedure/diagnosis, doctor involved, brief explanation. Also, some of the test technicians don't have access to your file, so you will hear \"Why are you here?\" Well, they know you need an ultrasound or a CT or whatever, but they may not know you were just diagnosed with BC or why you were sent there.

Looking at your previous post, I see you will have Arimidex (I think that's right) after you have your ovaries out. With Stage IV, as a cure is unlikely, the goal is to control the disease with the least toxic option first. If your cancer was agressive, you would have chemo ASAP.If you are having pain, then rads are advised, otherwise that's generally held off.  I am premenapausal, so the only hormonal therapy option for me is tamoxifen (plus ovarian suppression shot and Zometa). As it sounds like you had a recurrence and maybe were on tamoxifen b/4, aromotease inhibitors (AIs) are next on the hormonal buffet. But you have to be postmenapausal to do that.  I had a bad mammogram/us during the first week of July.  It was probably the end of August b/4 I had a treatment plan. The tests can take a lot of time, especially finding out the ER/PR Her2/Neu status. (Of course that may be my faulty recollection. It certainly seemed like it took forever.) Originally the onc was going to have me do chemo, but ultimately it was determined hormonal was the way to go. One thing that is difficult for me is that I still have my primary tumor. I think everyone's first instinct is \"Get this out of me!\" Altho hormonal therapy doesn't have the drastic side effects of chemo, it does work, albeit more slowly.  I just had my three month scans. Because I am sure I didn't grasp it the first time around, I asked the dr. to go over the pathology report and ultrasounds with me again. It did help clarify things.",

      "Content": "Oct 5, 2010 10:52PM EnglishMajor wrote: http://www.slate.com/id/2268104/pagenum/all/ Elaine Schattner on \"who is a survivor?\": As an oncologist, I'm not convinced of this label's accuracy, at least as it applies to a woman living after breast cancer; this, like some lymphomas and other tumors, can recur years, even decades after treatment ends. What's more, I worry the \"survivor\" lingo might cause harm: Just as the term can support or reflect upon a patient's courage and tenacity, it might alienate or wound someone who knows she can't alter the course of her disease At one level, it seems illogical to restrict the term's use, in medical parlance, to former and active cancer patients. We don't, for example, refer to Dick Cheney as a \"survivor,\" even though he's fortunate to be ticking after several heart attacks. A recent editorial in the Annals of Internal Medicine, \"Survivorship Will Be the Defining Challenge of Critical Care in the 21st Century,\" suggests this habit may turn. The authors appropriated the language to people who've come through prolonged intensive care and proposed that doctors draw on the \"oncology experience\" regarding the long-term physical and psychological toll of harsh, body-altering medical traumas. At a deeper level, what's wrong is that the expression connotes strength or heroism. Today, survivor feeds into the concept of cancer as some sort of contest of harsh ordeals. Best sellers like Dr. David Servan-Schreiber's Anticancer: A New Way of Life push the impression that survival implies you've done something right. The fault's in the converse: If you don't lick your tumor, you've failed. Maybe you chose the wrong treatment plan, ate the wrong foods, exercised too little or too much, or weren't sufficiently optimistic. But cancer is not a mystic life challenge or game. It's a disease, or really a set of complex diseases, that's common, feared, and widely misunderstood. ....The focus of many public awareness and fundraising campaigns, celebrating life and emphasizing survival, can be at odds with the bleak circumstances of patients with terminal disease. Increasingly, people are living with cancer as a chronic illness. More than 160,000 women are alive now with metastatic breast cancer\u2014all are \"survivors,\" many with low odds of remission. The precise number of patients living with recurrent or disseminated malignancy is uncertain but growing, a function of new, often-expensive, targeted treatments. In this context, the image of a cancer survivor as someone who's outlived, or overcome, the condition seems out-dated. Patients like Elizabeth Edwards offer a new kind of cancer survivor model, says Dr. Barron Lerner, a physician and medical historian at Columbia University (and Slate contributor). She illuminates how a woman can live, for years, with what's likely an incurable form of the illness. riumph-over-cancer narratives like Lance Armstrong's are powerful. To \"live strong\" works as an aspiration. It helps patients get through tough situations. Only a cynic would dismiss all the tangible, big-money support for research and the information and practical assistance offered by the survivor community's enthusiasm. But the true heroes in this\u2014those deserving of pink ribbons and medals, if they're to be given\u2014are those who struggle longest and hardest, who will never truly be \"survivors\" in the commonly accepted sense of the word. It's not the same for people like me, who move on with their lives after a discrete, albeit sometimes harrowing episode of illness. I'm an oncologist; I know I've done nothing in particular to deserve these eight years since my diagnosis. I lucked out, nothing more. And sure, I'm uncertain about my future. But who isn't?",

If your cancer was aggressive or immediately life threatening, you would have chemo first. Because the cancer has spread to one place, we have to assume it is elsewhere, too, we just can't see it yet.  The thing is, eventually a treatment will fail, so you go to the next one. So you'll start with this hormonal treatment and stay with it as long as it is doing you some good. Eventually you may have to have chemo and then you would have a range of options.   With metastatic cancer, you only have a certain number of bullets, so to speak, so you have to use them wisely.  Hormonal therapy can be just as effective as chemotherapy. Altho the side effects are not typically as drastic, it doesn't mean the drugs aren't as good. (Hormonal therapy does take a little longer to work, but it does work and typically doesn't impact your daily routine much.) Radiation for ladies with mets is generally used for pain relief. I don't know a lot about it, but I believe there is a limit to how much radiation you can have and hence metastatic breast cancer patients would generally get it if they were having pain.  I have bony mets (limited to some spots on my spine) and I am getting Tamoxifen (cause I am premenaupausal) and monthly Zometa. Here is a link to the Third consensus on medical treatment of metastatic breast cancer: advancedbc.org/blog/",

If I were a younger person who presented with mets (39 and younger) I would comment on this story---there ARE too many of you, no doubt about it..... As most women under 40 would NOT be screened (and screening really wouldn't help), I don't buy early detection as a rationale for a rise in more women being Stage IV at first dx. People don't want to scare others, but if I was dx'd in this age range (and especially if I had children)  you bet your ass I would be scared..... From the NYT story: \u201cWe need this to be sure ourselves about this potentially concerning, almost alarming trend,\u201d Dr. Bleyer said. \u201cThen and only then are we really worried about what is the cause, because we\u2019ve got to be sure it\u2019s real.\u201d Dr. Johnson said her own experience led her to look into the statistics on the disease in young women. She had breast cancer when she was 27; she is now 44. Over the years, friends and colleagues often referred young women with the disease to her for advice. \u201cIt just struck me how many of those people there were,\u201d she said. Dr. Donald A. Berry, an expert on breast cancer data and a professor of biostatistics at the University of Texas\u2019 M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, said he was dubious about the finding, even though it was statistically significant, because the size of the apparent increase was so small \u2014 1.37 cases per 100,000 women, over the course of 30 years. More screening and more precise tests to identify the stage of cancer at the time of diagnosis might account for the increase, he said. \u201cNot many women aged 25 to 39 get screened, but some do, but it only takes a few to account for a notable increase from one in 100,000,\u201d Dr. Berry said. Dr. Silvia C. Formenti, a breast cancer expert and the chairwoman of radiation oncology at New York University Langone Medical Center, questioned the study in part because although it found an increased incidence of advanced disease, it did not find the accompanying increase in deaths that would be expected. A spokeswoman for an advocacy group for young women with breast cancer, Young Survival Coalition, said the organization also wondered whether improved diagnostic and staging tests might explain all or part of the increase. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at this data with caution,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Michelle Esser. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to invite panic or alarm.\u201d She said it was important to note that the findings applied only to women who had metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis, and did not imply that women who already had early-stage cancer faced an increased risk of advanced disease. [Editorial comment from me: Cause 25% going on to Stage IV isn't scary enough....] Dr. J. Leonard Lichtenfeld , deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, said he and an epidemiologist for the society thought the increase was real. \u201cWe want to make sure this is not oversold or that people suddenly get very frightened that we have a huge problem,\u201d Dr. Lichtenfeld said. \u201cWe don\u2019t. But we are concerned that over time, we might have a more serious problem than we have today.\u201d",

I had to go every day for four weeks (this was about six weeks after surgery). It is a quick appointment (15 minutes), I was able to go before work.   I had a left mx, no recon. Because I did not have recon, the recovery was quick. I only had one drain (I am on the small side) for about two weeks. Will they take any lymph nodes out? (Probably not as they know you are Stage IV.) Because I had no nodes out, that too made my recovery quick.  If you have concerns about taking time off from work, ask if doctor can put you in touch with the hospital's social worker. You should know about the job protection you have under FMLA (provided your company employs 50 people or more). If you have insurance thru your job, you may have a short term disability policy. Cancer is a disability--you may be entitled to certain protections under the ADA act. Ask your doctor who at the hopital can help you navigate your time off, etc.  Hang in there",

Dr. Larry Norton Larry Norton, M.D. Deputy Physician-in-Chief for Breast Cancer Programs; Medical Director, Evelyn H. Lauder Breast Center; Norna S. Sarofim Chair of Clinical Oncology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center 1. If you have trouble making a decision, you don't know enough. If you gather enough information, the decision will make itself. 2. Make sure you communicate. You need to say to your doctor, \"I'm here to get better,\" not, \"Don't hurt me.\" If you're communicating that you are not interested in toxicity, then you may miss out on a treatment that could save your life. 3. If you don't like your doctor, your doctor probably doesn't like you. Don't stay with a physician with whom you're not comfortable. Don't force a relationship to work that isn't working. 4. You want a doctor to say, \"Here are the best options for you,\" not, \" This is what I can do for you.\" Doctors should be willing to look beyond their own knowledge to other experts for the best treatment. 5. When you think of your future, visualize positive things happening. 6. You are more than your body. Use your whole self to help yourself. 7. Don't forget the moment. Be in the moment and enjoy it. Sometimes patients get so focused on what happened in the past or what might happen in the future, they miss the moments they have.",

Despite efforts to prevent mouth sores, you may still develop them. Treating mouth sores primarily involves minimizing your pain until the cells of your mouth heal and begin regenerating after your cancer treatment ends. Tell your doctor if you develop any sensitivity in your mouth or notice any sores forming. Your doctor may recommend treatments, such as: * Coating agents. These medications coat the entire lining of your mouth, forming a film to protect the sores and minimize the pain you might feel while eating or drinking. * Topical painkillers. These medications can be applied directly to your mouth sores. Your mouth may feel numb when using painkillers, so be careful when eating or brushing your teeth because you won't be able to feel if you're causing more injury to your mouth. In addition to medications, you can take simple steps to reduce the pain you feel from mouth sores. You might: * Avoid painful foods. Stay away from acidic foods and spicy foods that could further irritate your mouth. Avoid sharp and crunchy foods, such as chips, crackers and pretzels, and instead opt for softer foods cut in small pieces. Alcohol also can irritate an already sore mouth, so don't drink alcohol. Eat foods at room temperature or slightly warm, since hot or cold foods might be painful to eat. * Eat small meals more frequently. Cut your food into small pieces and eat slowly. * Use a straw. A straw for drinking may help keep liquids away from sore areas in your mouth. * Continue cleaning your mouth. If it's too painful to use a toothbrush, ask your health care team or your dentist about special foam swabs, which are easier on your gums. Rinse out your mouth several times a day. Avoid mouthwashes that contain alcohol. Mix a weak saltwater solution to swish around in your mouth or try a combination of baking soda and warm water. What happens if mouth sores become severe? If your mouth sores progress, they can become severe and cause other complications. Sometimes these complications become so severe that you have to stop your cancer treatment temporarily. Complications can include: * Infection. Mouth sores offer a convenient way for germs to get into your body. Since cancer treatment can weaken your immune system, serious infection can result. Continue cleaning your teeth and mouth during and after treatment to reduce your risk of infection. * Bleeding. Chemotherapy reduces your blood's ability to clot. Bleeding from your mouth can range from mild, with some spotting when you brush your teeth, to severe, with bleeding that's difficult to stop. When your mouth sores bleed, continue cleaning your mouth as best you can - even if that means just rinsing with water. * Difficulty eating and swallowing. Painful mouth sores can make eating and drinking difficult. If eating small meals of soft foods isn't helping and you're quickly losing weight, your doctor may recommend a feeding tube to get you the nutrients you need. http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/mouth-sores/CA00054/NSECTIONGROUP=2",

      "Content": "Jun 26, 2011 08:35PM EnglishMajor wrote: STATISTICS--WHAT THEY REALLY MEAN TO YOU: From Conversations! The International Newsletter For Those Fighting Ovarian Cancer Some of the typical pieces of information usually found in health related newsletters are statistics. \"Statistics\" is defined as the \"systematic collection, organization, analysis, and interpretation of numerical data pertinent to any subject.\" Statistics can be encouraging or frightening depending on which number is applied to you or your circumstances and how the number is expressed. For those of you who have seen statistics and find them discouraging, let's talk about why those numbers may be misleading: 1. Statistics represent an average number, and averages mean there are numbers on both sides of the middle. An average of 25 may represent a low of 2 and a high of 48. Suppose you put one foot in boiling water and freeze the other in a block of ice. The \"average\" would probably be a normal 98.6 degrees, but you would be very uncomfortable. So much for statistical averages. 2. Statistics studies are usually performed over an extended time period. A typical study dealing with survival or remission rates (or length of time) usually requires 1-2 years, or longer, to find and enroll the study participants. The study itself usually lasts about 5 years or longer. Add another 1- 2 years to write the research paper and get it into print. This means that survival or remission statistics are about 5-10 years old or older. 3. Statistics are based on groups which may be entirely different from you--different in age, cell type, stage, nutritional status, initial surgical debulking, previous treatments, or even prior health states, which may influence how treatments work, etc. Remember that any set of statistics applies to a specific list of criteria. Clinical trials have a rigid list of things which determine who can participate in the study. The results of these studies, presented as statistics, can apply only to those who exactly fit the criteria--identical cell type, identical stage, identical age group, identical previous and current treatments, and on and on. No matter how similar your situation is, if your personal circumstances are only slightly different, the statistics are not totally applicable to you and your situation. 4. Statistics only really apply to the mythical human being who reacts like everybody else. Even if you appear to fit the criteria of a specific study, each human body reacts in a different way to the same situation. For example, if we all eat the exact same amount of an identical food, there will be many different reactions. One might be severely allergic to the food and react with shock; another have hives; another with itching; another with sneezing; another with a runny nose; and most of the others will have no reaction at all. 5. Statistical numbers can be manipulated to appear good or bad, to emphasize one side over the other. For example, it is 100% more likely to rain tomorrow than today (same as saying twice as much). That sounds pretty certain, doesn't it? But, if the chance of rain today is 2% and the chance of rain tomorrow is 4%, you would plan a picnic anyway! 6. Statistical group size makes big differences in the results. For example, the newspaper headlines read \"New Cure Found--100% in Study Cured!\" In the research paper, the study group consisted of 10 people. This isn't nearly as convincing as 100% of 5000. 7. Remember, you are you, an individual, and you are NOT an average. Even though some study states only 1% responded to a specific treatment, you may be the 1% to respond positively.",

I had some initial occasional joint discomfort (stiff fingers in the am kind of thing) but that didn't last. It was mildly annoying but nothing that required taking something.  I think I can blame some weight gain on tamoxifen (but what menopausal woman doesn't also face this issue?)  I would read the Tamoxifen thread with a grain of salt (even tho that could be cankle causing). We are all individuals and what is true for one person doesn't necessarily follow for another. But some of the issues people reported are not associated with Tamoxifen. I believe--as anyone would be when starting a new drug--some people are hypervigilant and because they are extra aware they perceive things that either may have always been an issue or are caused by something else.   Anyhow, when I started taking Tamoxifen I was on pins and needles. But so far so good. . . Becky, was wondering how you are doing, nice to see you posting!",

Symptoms of hypercalcemia resemble symptoms of other illnesses, making an early and rapiddiagnosis difficult. The severity of the symptoms may depend on other factors, such as previous cancertreatment, reactions to drugs, or other illnesses a patient may have. Most patients do not experience all of the symptoms of hypercalcemia, and some patients may not have any symptoms at all. However, most patients with high calcium levels in the blood do have symptoms. Some patients develop signs of hypercalcemia when calcium levels are only slightly high, while patients who have had higher calcium levels for a long time may show few symptoms. The most common symptoms of hypercalcemia are feeling tired, difficulty thinking clearly, lack ofappetite, pain, frequent urination, increased thirst, constipation, nausea, and vomiting.  Calcium plays a major role in the normal functioning of the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord). Symptoms of hypercalcemia may include weakness, loss of reflexes in the muscles, and decreased stamina. Patients with central nervous system symptoms may have changes in personality, difficulty thinking or speaking clearly, disorientation, or hallucinations. . .Headaches can also occur, which can be made worse by vomiting and dehydration. ",

It would be my understanding this is a confidential matters between she and I?  The other thing(s) are I am to have surgery in two weeks and thus have put in my STD and FMLA paperwork. I assume there is no \"penalty\" on filing for these accelerated benefits while under the STD/FMLA leave? Finally, I think this has been asked and answered, but I must ask again: Did any oncologist ever refuse to sign a Stage IV's accelerated benefit paperwork? My friend says since the doctor just told me I am stable  (and well enough to have surgery that they wouldn't otherwise do) that this would run contrary to signing the paperwork. Others point out that things could turn on a dime from one scan to the next. I really waffled over requesting the paperwork, but then I thought, it's not like the company is going to agonize over eliminating my job and if I don't at least ask  I could miss the opportunity.",

I think the key phrase here is \"by doing this\"  What the author is saying is that treatment's goal is control. If your disease is controlled/size decreased, it's possible you may live longer.  This is vaguely worded but I think the author is referring to tumor burden. Some say if you decrease tumor burden (for example via surgery) you  may do better than someone who hasn't had surgery. But we don't yet know this.  This is so vague it is easy to misconstrue. I don't think the author is commenting on evidence for chemo being life prolonging. I think she is saying: >Chemo can't cure people with MBC... >....but it hopefully can keep the cancer at bay for a long time... >...altho not cured, in some cases people with MBC having chemo (or other tx) will live longer.  Maybe the author is trying to make a distincition between \"survival\" and \"progression free survival\" I wouldn't read too much into it.....  FYI, this is what we are talking about:   Some treatments for metastatic breast cancer help lessen your symptoms by stopping the cancer from growing or by decreasing the size of the cancer for a period of time, even years. By doing this, treatment may also improve the length of your life, but this has not been proven in a clinical trial.",

In about 6 -10 % of all breast cancer patients, the cancer has spread to distant organs and is classified as Stage IV at the time of the first diagnosis. In the majority of patients with metastatic breast cancer, the metastasis is diagnosed after a cancer has already been treated at an earlier stage. Source: mbcn.org/education/category/di...  Hydeskate--you bring up a good point. Cancer is a disease of aging. The older a woman gets, the greater her lifetime odds are of having breast cancer. This is often misunderstood.  A promiinent journalist said:   \"I am now among the 1 in 8 women in this country - incredibly 1 in 8 - who have had breast cancer.\" But as Gary Schwitzer explains here  Quoting Gary: As the National Cancer Institute explains thoroughly on its website: Women born now have an average risk of 12.2 percent (often expressed as \"1 in 8\u2033) of being diagnosed with breast cancer at some time in their lives. On the other hand, the chance that they will never have breast cancer is 87.8 percent (expressed as \"7 in 8\u2033). But that is a lifetime risk. Risk increases with age, so the NCI provides a more helpful way of looking at it - for all of those women watching who are of different ages: A woman's chance of being diagnosed with breast cancer is: from age 30 through age 39 . . . . . . 0.43 percent (often expressed as \"1 in 233\u2033) from age 40 through age 49 . . . . . . 1.45 percent (often expressed as \"1 in 69\u2033) from age 50 through age 59 . . . . . . 2.38 percent (often expressed as \"1 in 42\u2033) from age 60 through age 69 . . . . . . 3.45 percent (often expressed as \"1 in 29\u2033) Do you see how misleading the \"1 in 8\u2033 can be?

One way of dealing with gossips like this is to wait for them to pause in their slandering and say, \"Well that's interesting what you say.

She had MBC for seven years--although she never made any public comment about it, I took inspiration, right after being diagnosed, to see Maggie Daley in the paper leading a Chicago Olympic delagation to Copenhagen. I only had bone mets, Maggie Daley had a lot more going on and she was flying on an INTERNATIONAL trip---not curled up on her couch as I then  perceived all people with MBC were. Anyhow, a year or two later, she was in the hospital for some complication and they ran a recent picture of her at some reception in a wheelchair.  We had a company lunch in the conference room and this came up. \"Did you see Maggie Daley?\" one co-worked asked the group. \"She looks TERRIBLE.\" This wasn't someone I really worked with and she had NO idea of my diagnosis. I was mad...Even tho Maggie Daley wasn't someone I knew, I felt defensive on her behalf. But the conversation kind of moved on and there wasn't really an opportunity for me to speak up for her--even tho part of me felt like I should. The story has one other twist...a year or two later I was quoted in a very minor way in a USA Today story on metastatic breast cancer. But the story was picked up by one of our Chicago dailies and, to play up the local angle, they ran my one sentence quote in a big block quote and I think they pulled a photo off my website. My colleague, the same one who was mean about Maggie Daley, saw it and and I know she was definitely taken aback.....(I hadn't seen the article and had no idea what she was talking about. I think I said, \"Are you sure that was me? I didn't talk to anyone at the Sun Times.\" So now she probably thinks I have cancer and am crazy, too...)",

With metastatic breast cancer, it is the least toxic option first.  Antihormonal drugs (like tamoxifen and Femara aka letroxole) have been shown to be equally effective as chemotherapy. Chemotherapy drugs work faster--if you had an immediate issue or your cancer had spread  to an organ, it's possible you would need the speed of chemo. There is often a tendency to equate a drug's side effect with its effectiveness. A drug that carries harsh side effects isn't necessarily \"more\" powerful.  Surgery isn't standard of care for people with metastatic breast cancer. In some cases there is thought to be  some benefit, so it might not necessarily be ruled out--it may be that your doctor wants to ensure your disease is under control before evaluating surgery.  Treatment for metatstatic disease is different for that of early stage disease, which can definitely be confusing!

Given that it was for a massage (which I would guess would be done in a private room) I don't understand why stage made a difference. As a practical matter, support groups probably should be separate...we have different issues. However---to exclude people with secondary breast cancer entirely on the grounds that they might scare people with early stage breast cancer is unacceptable. I went to a breast cancer event put on by our suburban support center (kind of like Gilda's club). The second day featured local oncologists/experts presenting the latest developments--the afternoon did include metastatic topics. However, the preceding day featured the Happy Pink Fiesta of Survivorhood....the author of \"Why I Wore Lipstick to My Mastecomy\" showed clips from her LifeTime movie and basically gave a big pink pep talk. A central plot point of the movie involved the author doing a topless photo shoot of her reconstructd breasts  for a woman's magazine. She's a big advocate of early detection...but she said NOTHING about reccurrence. It was like listening to the Erma Bombeck of breast cancer, because this is such an awesomely funny disease... Some people talked about being thrilled with their new normal, their great boobs, etc. I was so mad...I asked the author why we don't have cure. Unlike one attendee who planned a trip to Vegas to celebrate her new girls, I couldn't have reconstruction and my tx will never end.

I found that I would get so distracted by something I thought the dr said I really wasn't listening very well. When I replayed the audio, I found what I thought I heard and what the dr. said were different. The only way to confirm bone mets is via biopsy. This is typically done on an outpatient visit. I think asking about a biopsy--if the doctor doesn't bring it up--is an important question. Generally speaking biopsies are done under twilight sedation: You're awake but don't feel anything. We are all different, but I can tell you mine wasn't too bad. Sometime's a cancer's subtype can change from first diagnosis. It's a good idea to a have a new tumor biopsied. (Doesn't sound like you have a new \"lump\" at this point, tho, so this might not be an issue.) Another question: Ask your doctor if she would recommend a bone scan. Xrays are good--I think the bone scan might reveal more. I would guess the doctor would have to do a general exam and order more tests. I think some additional information would be needed. Consider some \"if then\" questions. \"If I DO have bone mets, can you give me an idea of the treatment you might recommend?\" \"If I DO have bone mets, would you say I have a low or high volume of disease? Something inbetween?\" How often will I be seeing you? How will my case be followed? (Example: typically an oncologist would do some kind of blood tests every visit; tumor markers might be ever other visit. Many patients start with follow up scans every three months to see how the treatment is working.) How will your orginal complaint of bone pain be addressed? Some people have radiation for bone pain. Would your doctor recommend this? Be prepared to give your medical history--you might already have this ready to go. If not, you might want to write up something similar to your signature block. The doctor may want copies of past scans, etc.,. Inevitably, you will think of an important question after you leave. Does your doctor accept emails? Who do you call? If they don't give you a business card, ask for one. take care from www.mbcn.org To better understand your diagnosis: What does a metastatic cancer diagnosis mean? To where has the cancer spread? Will a biopsy be needed? why or why not? What is the cancer sub-type? ER+, PR+, HER2+, or Triple Negative? To better understand your treatment: What are my treatment options? Which treatment do you recommend? why? Will this treatment enable me to live longer? live better? live longer AND better? What are the possible short-term side effects of this treatment? What are the possible long-term side effects of this treatment? Which side effects do you want me to report to you? how? How do I get help to relieve possible pain? nausea? fatigue? How often will I need treatment? Can I do any of this treatment at home or at my local doctor\u2019s office or hospital? Will this treatment interfere with any medications I am presently taking? affect other health problems I presently have? Do you recommend I get a port (an implanted device, generally in the chest area, through which blood is drawn and drugs are infused without repeated needle sticks)? why or why not? Do I need to take a bone strengthening medication such as Zometa? why or why not? Do I need to complete dental work before starting treatment?",

The results of a bone scan are usually available within 2 days. Bone scan Normal: The radioactive tracer is evenly distributed among the bones. No areas of too much or too little tracer are seen. Abnormal: The tracer may accumulate in certain areas of the bone, indicating one or more \"hot\" spots. Hot spots may be caused by a fracture that is healing, bone cancer, a bone infection (osteomyelitis), arthritis, or a disease of abnormal bone metabolism (such as Paget's disease). Certain areas of the bone may lack the presence of tracer, indicating one or more \"cold\" spots. Cold spots may be caused by a certain type of cancer (such as multiple myeloma) or lack of blood supply to the bone (bone infarction). What Affects the Test Factors that can interfere with your test and the accuracy of the results include: * Pregnancy. A bone scan is not usually done during pregnancy because the radiation could damage the developing baby (fetus). * Barium and bismuth. If a bone scan is needed, it should be done before any tests that use barium (such as a barium enema). * The inability to remain still during the test. * A full bladder, which can block the view of the pelvic bones. What To Think About * A bone scan does not distinguish between normal and abnormal bone growth by itself. So bone scan results must be interpreted along with your symptoms and the results of X-ray tests. In addition, other tests such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), blood tests, or a biopsy may also be needed to further evaluate abnormal bone scan results. * Some types of cancer or diseases cannot be identified on a bone scan.

If she doesn't have metasatic disease, the radation wouldn't be justified. (Typically, with someone with early stage breast cancer, radiation is used when the surgeon gets a close margin when doing a lumpectomy/mastectomy. For people with metastatic disease, radiation would be used for pain relief.) This will sound counterintuitive...if your mom DOES have Stage IV breast cancer, it's the least toxic option first: an antihormonal (typically tamoxifen) or aromatease inhibitor (something like Femara). She would also get a bone booster (xgeva or Zometa). She would stay on this treatment until it stopped working. If she had moderate progression, she would likely move onto to another AI. If her disease was spreading rapidly, it would be on to chemo. Regardless of AI or chemo, she would be on some treatment for life, as all on this board are. Every three months or so, she would go for follow up scans to see how the treament is working. She would probably see her oncologist every month or every other month for bood work and a basic \"How are you doing\" appointment. If your mom does NOT have Stage IV breast cancer....well, that depends. If she has earlier stage breast cancer she might get more \"aggressive\" treatment. Depends on  several factors. I hope your mom does not have breast cancer, metastatic or otherwise. Some people can do well for a long time with bone-only disease. As my surgeon said, no one dies of bone mets--tho they can be painful.  (When cancer spreads to liver, lung, brain, etc. that is a different kettle of fish.) I have bone only disease. Someday, in all likelyhood, my cancer will spread beyond my bones. But for now, it is one day at a time. Hang in there.",

Where were the mets initially diagnosed? Standard of care for metastatic breast cancer is the least toxic option first. It is unusual for someone presenting with mets to have surgery. Typically it would not be done from the outset unless the person had an immediately life threatening condition, a  large tumor or inflammatory breast cancer or some other condition. Unless someone has mitigating circumstances (large tumor, aggressive tumor, subtype such as triple negative that does not respond to antiestrogen/aromatease inhibitors--chemo in that case is essentionally the ONLY option) they would not have surgery or chemo right away. They would start with the least toxic option (i.e, something like Tamoxifen or Femara). When one drug stopped working they would switch to the next. Do you know why your wife had surgery and chemo out of the gate? Comorbidities must also be taken into account. As well as age. How old is your wife? I am 47--in all liklihood I will not attain the same age as your wife. Like her, I started at Stage IV.  I have a lot of options before I would have to consider chemo. Would you tell me to forgo chemo? I think we must all make our own choices--and respect those of others. You and your wife have made your choice. If you are happy with it, why have you come here? Seemingly the purpose of the discussion is to question others' choices--and in a disparaging way. Do you really want \"to understand\" or simply to reinforce the wisdom of your own choice? You seem to be angling for some kind of rebuttal. My suggestion borrows from yours--Enjoy life--don't waste it stirring the pot on the Internet discussion board. Make your wife a cup of tea, go play with your dog. Step away from your computer and enjoy the world around you.",

Swelling on one side of the body sometimes accompanied by pain, reddness and or warmth can signify a blood clot. Hopefully this has been ruled out but in any doubt, check it out ASAP. www.mayoclinic.com/health/bloo... hang in there Pain A blood clot in the upper arm can cause tenderness and pain in the arm or neck. This symptom is caused by the increased pressure on the vein and lack of blood flow to tissue. Swelling Swelling in the arm or neck can be a sign of a blood clot. This swelling may occur suddenly soon after the clot becomes trapped or swelling may come on slowly and become permanent if the affected vein is destroyed. Redness Redness may occur near the site of the blood clot, according to MayoClinic.com. The blood clot may be partially or completely blocking the vein, causing a backlog of blood in the arm. There may even be a bluish skin discoloration near the affected area of the arm. This is caused by blood cells escaping the damaged vein and leaking into the surrounding tissue. Warmth Increase in temperature when compared to the other arm. It is easier for a second person to touch both arms at the same time to detect if one is warmer than the other. Bulging veins Enlargement of veins close to the surface of the skin is caused by blood backing up in the arm because blood cannot get past the clot. A clot in the upper arm may cause bulging of the veins in the hand and lower arm. Discolored skin Eventually, if the clot does not dissolve or become dislodged, it may become covered in scar tissue. This destroys the vein and the surrounding tissue which may become oxygen starved and die. Dry, discolored skin may be noticed on the arm.",

      "Content": "Aug 20, 2012 07:33AM - edited Aug 20, 2012 07:39AM by EnglishMajor Presenting with mets is rare in that exbrnxgrl notes above only about 6% have mets from initial diagnosis--most people arrived here via recurrence. I asked my doctor about this--if I understood her correctly, the reason it is rare to present with mets is because of better imaging technologies and greater emphasis on having mammograms. While screening mammograms aren't perfect, overall we are finding breast cancer earlier.  In terms of support groups: I accidently went to my center's \"All Metastatic\" group (not realizing there was a specific mets group for peopel with breast cancer). This was a group of (to my mind) elderly people with various metastatic diseases.   I then went to the MBC group. As you may have experienced, even support groups can be clique-ish. I was the first person there. There were nametags on the table so filled one out and put it on (as they do for all the meetings at this center). Another woman came in and politely introduced hersel. Then a woman came in on a scooter and kind of gave me the once over (New Girl!). \"Oh,\" she said. \"We don't usually do name tags. We all know each other.\" When it was her turn to talk she told a harrowing tale of being fitted with a halo (\"I could feel them drilling the screws in my skull!\") in preparation for being treated for brain mets.  I used to work with a woman who would glory in sharing every harrowing, toe curling detail of her gum surgery. This woman was kind of like that---She told the story in the same way someone at a campfire might tell the tale of the couple necking on a dark road when suddenly there was a scratching at the car door and OMG! A CLAW(!) was dangling from the handle! etc. etc.  On the one hand, her experience had been harrowing and she was justtly proud of gotten through it and being there. But her personality kind of grated on me (from the moment she dissed my name tag) I was taking tamoxifen for my low volume of bone mets. I  didn't have a lot to share with the MBC group. In a followup discussion, the moderator asked me what I thought and I said I felt out of place. She suggested I try the group for people just starting their bc tx (all stages). I did feel more at home there. (This group isn't permanent, new ones form I think every 10 weeks or so.) I don't think the people in my group understood I was Stage IV. For where I was then, that was a good group for me. MBCN.org has a list of support goups for people with MBC, I'll find the link. I do think support groups are kind of hit and miss--my suggestion is to keep looking.   Support Groups:  mbcn.org/support-resources/cat... ",

She did some number crunching of her own. I am not an expert in charitable organizations/math that involves numbers greater than 10, so I am not qualified to say if Anna's interpretation is on the money. (So to speak.) I would like to see more money for mets research from all the big groups--I am looking at you American Cancer Society In terms of education, I believe Komen was a significant sponsor of the Metastatic Breast Cancer Network Conference this past fall in Indy.  That was a great event and, beyond our transportation and housing, free. So I would like to give credit for that.  I do have concerns that those on the front lines of advocating for research may not have keen insights into the MBC reality vs. early stage breast cancer. A woman who has exhausted all treatment can't necessarily wait until a drug has cleared every hurdle. What's the alternative?  GH&D. (Go home & die).  Whereas someone with early stage disease certainly should be very mindful of any potentiallly harmful side effects. But that woman has more options and perhaps more importantly, more time.  Unfortunately, our timetable is not the same. Drug safety is laudable but how do you weigh that against an MBC woman with her back up against the wall?  ",

It is ideally situated on Fannin, with easy walking distance to all the hospitals in the TMC complex. As noted by other readers, there's a light rail station immediately in front of the hotel, so you can zip downtown or to the Reliant Center. And if you're here for visiting or treatment at any of the hospitals, this is an ideal spot. And if you like coffee, well, you've come to the right spot. There's a Starbucks in the lobby of the hotel. And there's a Starbucks in the next block, and for good measure, there's a Starbucks three blocks away. But you can't live on coffee alone. We had breakfast and dinner in the hotel restaurant. The breakfast was good. We ventured to the restaurant for dinner after an exhausting day of appointments and had some rather good crayfish bisque followed by a salmon dish. when the waiter asked how was the salmon, we said a little overcooked. The staff then asked to replace the item but we had eaten most of it, so we were complaining with a full stomach. The maître d insisted on offering us a complimentary dessert - vanilla ice cream, very good, and then discounted our bill. The salmon wasn't that overdone, but they were insistent and wanted to leave us with a good impression. They succeeded.  The hotel staff were very friendly and attentive. We enjoyed our stay. The hotel room was not large, but it was a comfortable bed and very clean. We had a quiet night and would consider a return visit.",

One of these days is Yesterday with all its mistakes and cares, its faults and blunders, its aches and pains. Yesterday has passed forever beyond our control. All the money in the world cannot bring back Yesterday. We cannot undo a single act we performed; we cannot erase a single word we said. Yesterday is gone forever. The other day we should not worry about is Tomorrow with all its possible adversities, its burdens, its large promise and its poor performance; Tomorrow is also beyond our immediate control. Tomorrow's sun will rise, either in splendor or behind a mask of clouds, but it will rise. Until it does, we have no stake in Tomorrow, for it is yet to be born. This leaves only one day, Today. Any person can fight the battle of just one day. It is when you and I add the burdens of those two awful eternities Yesterday and Tomorrow that we break down. It is not the experience of Today that drives a person mad, it is the remorse or bitterness of something which happened Yesterday and the dread of what Tomorrow may bring. Let us, therefore, Live but one day at a time.",

A mastectomy (and attendant radiation to the chest wall) typically are not done at Stage IV. In some cases (if you have a low volume of disease) there is thought to be some benefit but it is not a given and not all women will have surgery. Typically women with MBC are scanned every  3 months to see how they are doing. Generally there can be three results: Stable (nothing bigger or smaller). Stable is good. No Evidence of Disease.  NED is  excellent. Progression: Disease is spreading, probably have to try something new. (But even if someone is Stable or NED, the cancer has already spread. Even tho we can't see it on the scans, we have to assume its out there.)  What general vicinity are you  in---there may be a support group that you as a caregiver could attend.  Hope this helps. ",

Dr. Larry Norton Larry Norton, M.D. Deputy Physician-in-Chief for Breast Cancer Programs; Medical Director, Evelyn H. Lauder Breast Center; Norna S. Sarofim Chair of Clinical Oncology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center 1. If you have trouble making a decision, you don't know enough. If you gather enough information, the decision will make itself. 2. Make sure you communicate. You need to say to your doctor, \"I'm here to get better,\" not, \"Don't hurt me.\" If you're communicating that you are not interested in toxicity, then you may miss out on a treatment that could save your life. 3. If you don't like your doctor, your doctor probably doesn't like you. Don't stay with a physician with whom you're not comfortable. Don't force a relationship to work that isn't working. 4. You want a doctor to say, \"Here are the best options for you,\" not, \" This is what I can do for you.\" Doctors should be willing to look beyond their own knowledge to other experts for the best treatment. 5. When you think of your future, visualize positive things happening. 6. You are more than your body. Use your whole self to help yourself. 7. Don't forget the moment. Be in the moment and enjoy it. Sometimes patients get so focused on what happened in the past or what might happen in the future, they miss the moments they have.",

I think CB  is best if you have ongoing medical news and want a reasonably secure place to share details and your own thoughts. It is better than an email group message which can result in a lot of invidual messsages that can cover the same ground.  CB users can sign up to get an email notification of a new post. Some people don't sign up for this, and, if you are not posting regularly, may not keep up with you. A blog (Wordpressis also very easy) is good for pushing out infornation.

Unless you had reported a  new symptom (such as blurred vision or being dizzy) it's unlikely he is suspecting brain mets. Brain mets generally require swift investigation/action, so if that was a concern, he would likely have sent you for the MRI right that day and you would see him sooner vs. later. Generally speaking, people with HER2+ disease are a higher risk for brain mets: Breast cancer metastasizes (spreads) to the brain in about 15-20% of women with metastatic disease. However, some factors put patients at higher risk. Women who are under fifty years of age, who have HER2 positive tumors, estrogen receptor-negative tumors, and lung or liver metastases are somewhat more likely to be diagnosed with brain metastases. Studies indicate that mutations in the BRCA1 gene are also a risk factor (Source: http://www.brainmetsbc.org/en/content/frequently-asked-questions-about-brain-metastasis) Hang in there.",

In general it's probably true that bone-only disease is \"better\" than having organ involvement. But there are no hard or fast rules. Being ER/PR+ is \"good\" in that you likely have more tx options. Some drs. say that disease \"tempo\" is a key factor--having five years between your original dx and mets is \"good\" in that indicates slow tempo.  Stable is definitely awesome! Beats the heck out of progression any day!!  Susan Davis, a tireless volunteer with the MBCN, said it best. Susan lived with mets for almost a dozen years. Although she endured progressively more grueling treatments, she said ultimately even the harshest side effects weren't as difficult as the mental fight. \"I live in a constant state of hopeful dread,\" she wrote. \"I am hopeful I will be stable.

No one dies from breast cancer that remains in the breast. Metastasis occurs when cancerous cells travel to a vital organ and that is what threatens life. 2. Metastasis refers to the spread of cancer to different parts of the body, typically the bones, liver, lungs and brain. 3. An estimated 155,000 Americans are currently living with metastatic breast cancer. Metastatic breast cancer accounts for approximately 40,000 deaths annually in the U.S. 4. Treatment for metastatic breast cancer is lifelong and focuses on control of the disease and quality of life. 5. About 6% to 10% of people are Stage IV from their initial diagnosis. 6. Early detection does not guarantee a cure. Metastatic breast cancer can occur 5, 10 or 15 years after a person\u2019s original diagnosis and successful treatment checkups and annual mammograms. 7. 20% to 30% of people initially diagnosed with early stage disease will develop metastatic breast cancer. 8. Young people, as well as men, can be diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer. 9. Like early stage breast cancer, there are different types of metastatic breast cancer. 10. Treatment choices are guided by breast cancer type, location and extent of metastasis in the body, previous treatments and other factors. 11.Metastatic breast cancer is not an automatic death sentence. Although most people will ultimately die of their disease, some will live long and productive lives. 12. There are no definitive prognostic statistics for metastatic breast cancer. Every patient and their disease is unique. 13.

There is part of me that would quit work right away--I have other ways to fill my time. But I think of a work friend of mine, a guy who was 51. He was dx'd with some kind of mouth cancer. We don't work for the same people but we are in the same industry. When I learned he was sick, I sent him a card but I never heard from him. (He couldn't talk on the phone, so calling him was out.) Anyhow, my friend was always a bit of a loner--didn't have close family, not married and a bit of a workaholic. Head and neck cancers ofen carry a grim prognosis and such was his case, altho he was determined to keep working. Because of the radiation, he could no longer speak--I guess he emailed his coworkers to have work discussions (tho they were in the same office). He couldn't eat well--he was always a thin guy and was visibly weakened by his tx. Because of the tx, he had difficulty swallowing and would sometimes be making choking noises. He worked in a cubicle. An empty office was availabe and his boss offered to let him have it. My friend refused. He may have felt it was less about making a compassionate gesture to him and more about making everyone else more comfortable. I had assumed that with chemo and rads he was getting there was no way he would or could continue to work. But he did. A little more than a year after his dx he died on his way to work. He collapsed in lobby of his condo building--I think his heart probably gave out. In writing to his colleagues, I reflected that going to work gave my friend a purpose and distraction. It's not what I would choose, but for him it was a good thing. So who knows, maybe that's how it is for Robin. Wish her the best.",

Typically surgery would only be done if the disease in good control. If there was visceral involvement, surgery probably wouldn't be done.  I don't think that tumor removal could accelerate the spread of the disease. But equally important, there is no guarantee that having the surgery will benefit your MIL. Ultimately it is your MIL's choice.  I have a low volume of bone mets and had a mastectomy this past May. If you do a search on thi site you will find additional discussions.  [from a previous thread] AnnNYC AnnNYC wrote: Hi Donna -- I hope you don't mind my posting the following literature links (this kind of literature search and review is part of what I do for a living). There are in fact recent (2006-2008)retrospective studies showing an overall survival benefit -- and even more of a progression-free survival benefit -- with removal of an intact primary tumor in women who are diagnosed at Stage IV, especially in women who are ER+ and have only bone mets. These are probably some of the studies Becky shared with English Major -- and like English Major said, they are all retrospective \"chart reviews\" comparing the outcomes in women who had surgery to women who didn't. So the results may be biased -- the women who had surgery may have been chosen to have it because they were healthier, or the fact that they had surgery may just have been part of their having more \"involved\" care from their doctors -- so that's why the prospective trial English Major mentioned is so important. But still, here is a summary of reports that found a benefit: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16614878Babiera Babiera GV, et al. Effect of primary tumor extirpation in breast cancer patients who present with stage IV disease and an intact primary tumor. Annals of Surgical Oncology 2006;13:776-782. M.D. Anderson, Houston, TX -- All (224) breast cancer patients treated at M.D. Anderson between 1997 and 2002 who presented with stage IV disease and an intact primary tumor. CONCLUSIONS: Removal of the intact primary tumor for breast cancer patients with synchronous stage IV disease is associated with improvement in metastatic progression-free survival. Prospective studies are needed to validate these findings. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17522944 Gnerlich J, et al. Surgical removal of the primary tumor increases overall survival in patients with metastatic breast cancer: analysis of the 1988-2003 SEER data. Annals of Surgical Oncology 2007;14:2187-2194. A retrospective, population-based cohort study by using the 1988-2003 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program data: 9734 SEER patients with stage IV breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Extirpation of the primary breast tumor in patients with stage IV disease was associated with a marked reduction in risk of dying after controlling for variables associated with survival. www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/p ubmed/17687611 Fields RC, et al. Surgical resection of the primary tumor is associated with increased long-term survival in patients with stage IV breast cancer after controlling for site of metastasis. Annals of Surgical Oncology 2007;14:3345-3351. Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO - 409 patients with stage IV breast cancer treated from 1996 to 2005. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical excision of the primary breast tumor was associated with significantly longer survival in this cohort of stage IV breast cancer patients, even after controlling for other factors associated with survival. Randomized clinical trials are needed to validate these findings. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18438108 Blanchard DK, et al. Association of surgery with improved survival in stage IV breast cancer patients. Annals of Surgery 2008;247:732-738. Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX - 807 women with stage IV disease at presentation. CONCLUSION: Patients with stage IV breast cancer who had definitive surgical treatment of their primary tumors had more favorable disease characteristics. However, after adjustment for these characteristics, surgical treatment remained an independent factor associated with improved survival. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18357493 Rao R, et al. Timing of surgical intervention for the intact primary in stage IV breast cancer patients. Annals of Surgical Oncology 2008;15:1696-702. University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas - review of all breast cancer patients between 1997 and 2002 presenting with an intact tumor and synchronous metastatic disease. Patients who underwent surgery in the 3-8.9 month or later period had improved metastatic progression-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical extirpation of the primary tumor in patients with synchronous stage IV disease is associated with improved metastatic PFS when performed more than 3 months after diagnosis. Resection should be planned with the intent of obtaining negative margins. HOWEVER, this paper from Brigham and Women's in Boston does NOT see any real benefit: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18581232 Bafford AC et al. Breast surgery in stage IV breast cancer: impact of staging and patient selection on overall survival. Breast Cancer Research and Treatment 2009;115:7-12 Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston - Review of prospectively maintained database of 147 women who presented with stage IV breast cancer between 1998 and 2005. CONCLUSIONS: Breast surgery is associated with improved survival in stage IV breast cancer. However, in our experience, this benefit is only realized among patients operated on before diagnosis of metastatic disease and is likely a consequence of stage migration bias. While some women may warrant palliative surgery to the breast, it is unclear that such surgery otherwise improves clinical outcomes. The possible biases in these retrospective studies are summed up well in this editorial (the link should take you to the whole article): http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077920/?tool=pubmed Khan SA. Primary Tumor Resection in Stage IV Breast Cancer: Consistent Benefit, or Consistent Bias? Annals of Surgical Oncolog 2007;14:3285-3287 ...five retrospective studies... present us with consistent evidence that either surgical therapy of the primary tumor has a substantial survival benefit in women with metastatic breast cancer, or there is a strong and consistent selection bias driving the use of surgery in women who have more favorable profiles (i.e., younger age, smaller tumor burden, better access to care). It is also possible that surgery is a surrogate indicator of more aggressive therapy overall, including more aggressive systemic therapy, which translates into better survival. All authors acknowledge the problem of selection bias in the interpretation of these data, and all advocate for a randomized trial to settle this question.",

Tamoxifen\u2019s anti-estrogen affinity is thought to depend on the activity of its primary metabolite, endoxifen. Tamoxifen is metabolized to endoxifen through the liver enzyme CYP2D6. Consequently, any co-administered agent that inhibits this enzyme will reduce the conversion of tamoxifen to endoxifen, thereby potentially reducing the efficacy of tamoxifen as a breast cancer therapy (Jin et al, 2005). Many commonly used antidepressants are CYP2D6 inhibitors, thus clinicians and patients must consider possible interactions when using these treatments in women taking tamoxifen.",

So that' something to be aware of. I am pretty sure  the ER would check for these things.   I hope your MIL will get some relief soon.  http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/side_effects/dizziness.jsp Dizziness can be caused by a sudden drop in blood pressure or from being dehydrated. If you get up too quickly from a sitting- or lying-down position, you might feel lightheaded. Some women feel dizzy while they're having a hot flash. Several breast cancer treatments can cause dizziness: In addition, some antihistamines, antiseizure medications, antidepressants, and tranquilizers can cause dizziness. Many pain medications can also make you dizzy. http://www.livestrong.com/article/95897-symptoms-blood-clot-foot-leg/ When a clot forms in the deep veins of the legs, it can either partially or totally block the venous return to the heart. According to Clot Care, larger blood clots in the major veins will cause swelling and pain in the affected leg, lower than the clot. The pain in the leg is often worse with standing or walking and is caused from the lack of oxygen supply to the muscles required for balance and walking. The increased workload during standing and walking leads to a greater oxygen demand. Because the muscles aren't being supplied with oxygen, pain is the result.

While the primary symptom of lumbar degenerative disc disease is usually low back pain, leg pain and foot pain are also common symptoms. When lumbar degenerative disc diseasepresents with leg pain and/or foot pain, this is called \u201creferred pain\u201d. Another common example of referred pain includes neck/arm or shoulder pain caused by heart attacks. The brain cannot always distinguish exactly where the pain source is, and so feels pain more vaguely in multiple areas. Referred pain is typically dull, achy, and  poorly localized.   Spinal stenosis in the low back occurs when the spinal nerve roots are compressed or choked, usually by enlarged facet joints located in the back of the spinal column. Spinal stenosis usually, but not always, occurs in elderly patients as the facet joints enlarge due to degeneration of the spine that tends to occur with age. The narrowing can be confirmed with an MRI scan. The symptoms of spinal stenosis are often referred to as sciatica - leg pain, radiating pain, tingling, leg weakness and/or numbness. Doctors usually use the words radiculopathy or radiculitis to describe the same symptoms. The leg pain from stenosis tends to develop gradually over time (mirroring the cumulative narrowing process taking place in the spine as the facet joints enlarge). Spinal stenosis symptoms tend to improve when the patient leans forward, a position that has the effect of opening up the back of the spinal column, taking pressure off the spinal nerve roots. ",

Take care SYMPTOMS OF METASTATIC BRAIN TUMORS HEADACHE: Headache is caused by stretching of sensitive structures such as blood vessels or nerves due to edema, spinal fluid obstruction or tumor growth, or by injury to the brain caused by the tumor. Initially, the headache comes and goes, and is usually more common in the morning, just after awakening. It gradually increases in duration and frequency. Ataxia is more common in people with spinal fluid obstruction, or with tumors involving the cerebellum. Cerebellar tumors often cause dizziness and vomiting.  ",

The remaining $20,500 will go to METAvivor, a nonprofit, volunteer-run group that funds metastatic breast cancer research.

Here is an excerpt:  On first meeting, you would not guess that Lorraine Heidke-McCartin, a cheerful woman who raised four children, has been battling an aggressive form of breast cancer since 2006. During that time, Heidke-McCartin, 54, has experienced heartening victories and wrenching setbacks. Last summer, her hopes were buoyed when her doctors said she was a good candidate to take a promising experimental drug at Boston's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. The treatment, called T-DM1, had reduced patients' tumors - with few side effects - during clinical trials. \"They were feeling very encouraged about this drug,'' Heidke-McCartin recalled. \"I said, \u2018Can I tell my kids this is good news?' '' Yes, her doctors said. But in late August, shortly before the treatments were to start under a so-called expanded access program, the drug's maker, the Genentech division of Roche Holding AG, shut down the program in Boston after the Food and Drug Administration refused to speed the approval process. The about-face underscores the plight of thousands of patients whose lives can be thrown into upheaval by decisions about who can receive experimental drugs. Desperate to regain their health, they might be willing to try almost any treatment, even if it is unproven. But regulators and companies also must make sure a drug that is initially effective does not later prove to be dangerous. That requires years of clinical trials. And to make trials scientifically valid, some patients enrolled in them - no matter how ill - don't receive the drug being tested. In certain cases, however, \"compassionate use'' of experimental drugs is permitted through expanded access programs, like the one Heidke-McCartin was headed for in Boston. Four months after the Dana-Farber program was scrapped because the FDA denied accelerated approval, she is still fighting HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. But she is finally taking T-DM1, which combines Genentech's powerful antibody with a cancer-killing agent made by a Waltham biotechnology company, ImmunoGen Inc. To get it, she must travel to a hospital in Fairfax, Va. - every month, at her own expense. The 950-mile round trips are exhausting, but Heidke-McCartin said she manages because of her faith, her husband, Phil McCartin - who has been her chief medical advocate - and her growing family, including five grandchildren born since her diagnosis. \"I was ready to give up,'' she said, describing side effects from other cancer drugs that ranged from nausea and hair loss to yellowed palms. \"Then I would look at my grandchildren and get back on my feet again.'' Genentech is moving forward with the regulatory approval process for T-DM1, but based on the current FDA timetable, it won't reach the market before 2013. For now, it's available only to patients in trials and those eligible for treatment at 13 expanded access sites across the country - none within 450 miles of Boston.Continued...",

Cancer is considered a disability under the Americans With Disabilty Act. No company with a responsible HR department would risk letting you go on some flimsy pretext because you have cancer. If you have an exemplary work record it would look mighty suspicious if you were cut loose on some trumped up excuse.  In my case, I felt it was certain that my job would end--NOT due to the cancer but because the area I worked in was struggling and there was no way to justify my ongoing employment--or that of several other departments. I was ultimately let go--but it was part of general layoff, it had nothing to do with my \"burden\" on insurance costs. (So I couldn't claim I was discriminated against.)  I was fortunate to find another job with benefits.  Now, with the Affordable Healthcare Act, I have somewhat less fear as I know I could not be denied insurance and (hopefully) it would indeed be affordable.  Loyola U. has a free Disability Law Center, should you have concerns your emloyer is discrimating against you:  http://www.disabilityrightslegalcenter.org/contact...

My doctor went over the pros and cons and stressed that the decision was mine.  Below is a link  to the Third consensus on medical treatment of metastatic breast cancer  Reading this helped me grasp the big picture and kind of know what I might expect down the road for tx.   http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/content/20/11/1771.full I like the people at my treatment center, but it is a big place and not immune to bureaucratic challenges. Early stage women have a half day orientation session to the hospital where they learn about the various departments etc. I came to this center as a second opinion. I did not have surgery right away as an early stage woman would. So I did not get the \"playbook\" they distribute during the orientation session. This wasn't staff indifference as much as perhaps an innocent oversight... ",

But I just came from an u/s and PET scan (reported to hospital at 8:00; finished at 3:30. It was a stressful day. I wasn't told to bring my films (figured why bother, that was a mammogram, this is an u/s) or other records. (Gave my doc the whole file, pile of reports and CDs and stupidly assumed the relevant details were now on file.)  I know breast tumors sizes are sometimes given other more familar equivalents. (A  Double AA battery, for example.) Well mine feels as big as a hummingbird and doesn't seem to be shrinking. So no great hopes for the u/s. Didn't know if I would get results on the same day, I did previously.   Huge delay to get the u/s because I wasn't told to bring orignal films and prior u/s.  Plus, there happended to be many  complicated cases prior to me. I was quite short with the nurse, especially as the time drew near to the PET. You can't mess with the PET schedule. \"Is there a problem here?\" asked the radiologist (whom I have never met). I apologized for my bad temper which I think is fueled by uncertainty/anxiety about these tests. \"There are books you can read,\" says  radiologist, eager to brand me  as crazy AND terminal. She specifically cited Elizabeth Kulbler Ross. I nearly gagged. EKR??? I had to read that in high school more than two decades ago. This is her frame of reference???  She also cited some relative with colon cancer. Because everyone knows someone with cancer and that helps them understand what exactly what I am going thru.  After waiting three hours for u/s, had to go to PET and then come back. PET took  2.5 hours, as expected.  Came home and had several glasses of wine. Doc did not call, so I can look forward to that call at work tommorrow.   Which is all a long way around the barn to saying, I don't usually come home and have a drink, but tonight I really neeeded one, and  I enjoyed it!!!",

I think there were a few college bull sessions where kids thought in romantic terms (\"I want black roses at my funeral,\" I remember some guy saying.) In terms of cancer it is truly a roller coaster. When first dx'd, I thought I would be making a quick exit. When I did not and enjoyed some years of stability, I think I got a little complacent. You know, death was something that happened to others. Maybe I was just lucky. Then when I had significant progression, I was kind of back to the way I felt during the first weeks/months of my diagnosis. Then things kind of swung back the other way as I didnt' have to drastically change tx and feel pretty good. I thing I sometimes engage in mental games of \"Would You Rather\"....ie \"Would You Rather Pop Off Quickly or Linger For Awhile With Uncertain QOL....\" Then I think, \"If I have time to be doing all this thinking things are pretty darn good because if the shyst was truly hitting the fan at the moment, I would be way too busy/frantic and/or debilitated to do anything but concentrate on being alive. . .\"",

And they did institute some kind of wellness plan. If you smoked, you also were required to pay a higher premium. I never knew of any employees targeted due to their health status. Again, all of my colleagues, well or not, knew layoffs were a distinct possibility just because of the poor business environment. My situation wasn't quite the same, as I was on tamoxifen, so the greatest expense from me would have been scans.

I had not had an issue with hot flashes or night sweats or other menopausal stuff because my level of estrogen was pretty low beforehand (thank you, Zoladex!). You are not supposed to lift more than 10lbs for a bit. take care  PS I work from home (writing at computer). I had to get back to a project--I had the surgery on a Weds. I rested from Weds to Sunday. I felt fine to get back to it. But if you can take the time to rest, do it, note what Leah and Jenn said about doing too much too soon. ",

It was originally thought I would be having surgery and or chemo. (I was ultimately found to have a low volume of bone mets and put on Tamoxifen.) My senior subordinate had to \"take over.\" I returned about a month later and it was so hard to re-establish our roles. My subordinate treated me like a ghost. I used to call meetings and lead them. Now I wasn't even being invited. In fairness, it was hard on my colleague. She had to do my job (and it's not like she was compensated for doing it). On the other hand, I think she enjoyed the power (such as it was). My head was not really in my job for months. I was just trying to get my mind around everything. Asserting myself at work wasn't a top priority...On one level, it bothered me (or my ego) that I had been usurped, on the other hand, I was just going thru the motions at work. It was hard to explain why I wasn't having chemo or surgery. I think my subordinate feared I would suddenly be back to my rounds of tests or possibly hospital stays and she had to protect herself, too. So who knows....it could be that Robin herself insists on \"doing it all.\"",

She is doing the standard treatments (anihormonals, I think tamoxifen) plus \"supplementing\" with periodic treatment at a (to my mind) dubious \"clinic\" in the Southwest. She is on SSDI which typically does not cover alternative tx. So she has set up fundraisers etc. to come up with the $30k at the clinic, things like Vitamin C IVs, etc.  Her healh is generally good, which she ascribes to the \"clinic\" as she now puts forth more fund raising bulletins for another visit. During her first stay at the clinic, she met six other patients, with various cancers, one with MBC. All have since died. This might make me think I could do something better with $30k. But the rationale is \"they waited too long\" to go to this place. A simple Google search revealed her doctor has run afoul of the state board on several occasions. One of the drugs he touted to her has all been called quackery. And yet, this woman handed her medical records to this guy and wrote down everything he said, as tho he were some great guru. (He did advise her to take the hormonal tx.) It was like she had an audience with the Mighty Oz... I think people believe what they want to, even in the face of massive evidence to the contrary....",

If your sister's cancer were immediately life threatening or agressive, she would have to start with chemo. Sometimes people equate side effects with a drug's effectiveness. Hormonal (ie tamoxifen) therapy is just effective as chemo, but it does take longer to work. If your sister need fast action, she would have chemo right away. With Stage IV, the goal is control. After awhile, a given treatment will stop working and it on to the next one. Women with ER/PR+ HER2-  generally have a wider range of drugs to work with.  In terms of drains, size would come into  play.

Although she endured progressively more grueling treatments, she said ultimately even the harshest side effects weren't as difficult as the mental fight. \"I live in a constant state of hopeful dread,\" she wrote. \"I am hopeful I will be stable.

Assume the radiation was for pain, hopefully that helped.  ER/PR+ w/HER2NEU+ often has an indolent course. If your mom's cancer was aggressive she would likely have to do chemo first.  If your mom's cancer was limited to her breast, she would get local treastment (possibly surgery, chemo and radiation). Becasue it has spread beyond the breast, it must be treated systemically (whole body). Even she had a mastectomy, the cancer would still be in her bones. Can't remove bones, so hence no surgery. Surgery isn't standard of care for someone with Stage IV, but in some cases there is thought to be some benefit. Each case is considered individually--it might not make sense for your mom to have surgery.    With metastatic breast cancer you try one thing and generally are scanned every 3-4 months. When it stops working you move onto the next drug. Some people can get years out of antihormonals, which is awesome.  It is \"good\" that your mom has estrogen receptive (ER/PR+) cancer in that there are many antihormonal options for it.   As my doctor told me, no one dies of bone mets. (Which is not to say they aren't painful or won't spread. But once cancer spreads outside the bones, that is a different kettle of fish.) We are all different---I am 46 & have a small volume of bone mets but overall am in good health. If your mom has other health issues, that is something else that must be considered. Terri is correct that most people with bone mets have a bisphosphonate (bone booster infusion of Zometa or Xgeva). I did not start with right away tho but it is something to ask about. Generally your teeth have to be in good shape b/4 you can start on Zometa or Xgeva. Vitamin D  is important for bone health, typically oncologists will check this level when they do blood tests (not every time, just perodically).  ",

As most know I volunteer with the Metastatic Breast Cancer Network MBCN is a national, independent, nonprofit, patient advocacy group dedicated to the unique concerns of the women and men living with metastatic breast cancer. MBCN was founded in 2004 by Jane Soyer and Nina Schulman. When diagnosed with advanced breast cancer, they experienced feelings of isolation from the very groups established to provide support. They felt the stigma of being a \u201cfailure\u201d in the breast cancer community. Their belief that cancer cannot be viewed as a disease from which one is either a \u201csurvivor\u201d or to which one has succumbed, fueled their desire to advocate for change. Metavivor champions research.... . An all volunteer, non-profit organization, METAvivor was founded and is run largely by persons with MBC. Established in 2007 as a local (Annapolis MD) support program, the group began a fundraising campaign in 2008, became a non-profit organization in 2009, began awarding its own annual MBC research grants in 2010 and in 2011 began advocating 30% for 30%",

Sometime ago, I read the following description and it stuck with me. I'm passing it along in the hopes that you and others might take some comfort from it. Take care Arranging The Shiva House The physical set-up of the shiva house includes the following: Memorial Candle - A person's soul is compared to a flame, since each person brings light into the world. And just as one can take from a flame to light more candles without diminishing the original flame, so too a person can give of him/herself, touching many lives, without ever being diminished. The wick and the flame are also compared to the body and soul, and the strong bond between them. And just as a soul always strives upward for what is good and right, so too a flame burns toward the heavens. Thus a memorial candle is lit in the shiva house and remains burning publicly 24 hours per day throughout the entire week. When you look at the candle, remember that your loved one's soul is eternal. This thought can help bring light into the darkness in which you are now immersed.",

So it is \"open\" until the last bit.  With PETs you may be able to wear your clothes; for MRIs you will likely have to wear a gown (and no metal due to magnet).   For the PET, you would like get a tracer injection and then sit in a dark/quiet room to let it work thru you.   MRIs are more enclosed, tho some facilities offer open ones. For the MRI, consider asking your doctor for antianxiety medicine beforehandl ",

They are affiliated with Loyola (Los Angeles) and their services are free. They can advise of you of your rights under the ADA . Even if you think this doesn't apply to you, I would still give them a call--there might be something you didn't know. Or they may have tips. And you have nothing to lose. See: www.disabilityrightslegalcenter.org The Cancer Legal Resource Center (CLRC) is a national, joint program of the Disability Rights Legal Center and Loyola Law School Los Angeles. The CLRC provides free information and resources on cancer-related legal issues to cancer survivors, caregivers, health care professionals, employers, and others coping with cancer. A cancer diagnosis may carry with it a variety of legal issues, including insurance coverage, employment and taking time off work, access to health care and government benefits, and estate planning. The CLRC has a national, toll-free Telephone Assistance Line (866-THE-CLRC) where callers can receive free and confidential information about relevant laws and resources for their particular situation. Members of the CLRC's Professional Panel of attorneys, insurance agents, and accountants can provide more in-depth information and counsel to CLRC callers. Also: www.cancerandcareers.org/emplo...  The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA): * Covers employers with 15 or more employees * Includes cancer in its definition of \"disability\" * Prohibits employers from discriminating against a person with cancer or with a history of cancer * Requires \"reasonable workplace accommodation\" of people with cancer * Covers a \"qualified\" person, defined as one who has the experience and training to be able to \"perform the essential functions\" of the job. * Requires an employer to provide the same compensation and benefits to someone with cancer as it would provides to an employee without cancer. * Will be most useful for a person with cancer who is going through treatment and needs an accommodation like working at home. * Covers an employee with cancer only if she decides to disclose that she has cancer. Protects caregivers as well as people with cancer.

Another consequence of This FDAs' bureaucratic, political , denial of approval , is that pts continue to be forced into trials with rigid dosing rules ( once you reduce you cant go back up ), and timing ( more than 6 weeks betw. doses, and you may get dropped ). So the s/e of platelet drop is made worse by This FDA ! I know this may sound scary, but want people to be informed. It is a great , breakthrough Drug for metastatic her2 . !! QOL is awesome !

She writes: Last night, Genentech announced that T-DM1 has shown a statistically significant (but unspecified) increase in the length of time prior to disease progression (PFS) in their Phase III EMILIA trial, when compared with lapatinib (Tykerb) plus capecitabine (Xeloda) in HER2+ MBC patients whose disease has progressed on Herceptin plus Taxol. T-DM1, or as the company is now calling it, Trastuzumab Emtansine, is an antibody-drug conjugate, made by linking Herceptin with a potent chemotherapy drug too toxic to use intravenously, in such a way that it is released only within the HER2+ cancer cells targeted by the Herceptin. This decreases the toxicity of the chemotherapy for patients. There are no numbers indicating what the increase in median PFS actually is in this press release, and we do not yet know if T-DM1 helps patients live any longer, known as overall survival (OS). The full results will be presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting in early June, and the full results will be submitted to FDA for approval. As you may recall, FDA rejected Genentech's application for approval for T-DM1 a couple of years ago based on the results of a single-arm study in late stage HER2+ MBC, since they require comparative data, even though these results looked very promising. However, several factors argue that the application for approval will be successful this time--in my opinion. >First, Tykerb has been shown to be inferior when compared directly with Herceptin. >Second, several studies have demonstrated that Herceptin continues to be effective after failure of initial treatment with Herceptin+Taxol, when combined with another chemotherapy agent. >Third, measured toxicities will almost certainly be significantly less with T-DM1 when compared with Tykerb+Xeloda, which has diarrhea as an overlapping toxicity with both drugs, and also causes rash (Tykerb) and hand-foot syndrome (Xeloda) in a high proportion of patients. >And fourth, in considering drug approvals, FDA considers a decrease in toxicity to be a real clinical benefit, although short periods of PFS has been controversial as an outcome (endpoint), as we saw with Avastin. When considering drugs for approval, FDA always weighs safety (toxicities) against efficacy. As an avid follower of the FDA approval process, I believe that if the PFS turns out to be more than a month or two in EMILIA, and if the toxicities are much less, that T-DM1 will win approval this time. So, all in all, good news! Here is the press release: http://www.gene.com/gene/news/press-releases/display.do?method=detail&id=13887 Musa  http://www.bcmets.org/articles/148924",

The phrasing of the above suggests an unwritten sentiment: We expect your disease to inconvenience us.  Thanks for ensuring it doesn't.  When I was first diagnosed, I had to take two weeks off for tests etc.  Before the telltale bone scan (Do Not Pass Go, Do Not Collect $200, Go Directly to Stage IV Jail), I was preparing for a mastectomy. Well, didn't have one and went back to work. My coworker referred to me as being on medical leave. I informed her that if I WAS on leave, I would have told her and the HR dept in writing.  What was worse, she was acting like I had one foot in the grave and the other on a banna peel. In retrospect, I understand her reaction--how would she know what was going on with me (I barely did). But man, was I pissed off. Probably because \"medical leave\" suggested a helplessness or hospital stay that just wasn't there.  In fairness, her misstatement of my absence was  a minor thing but it probably unleashed a lot of anger about related issues. ",

An experience with her own mother, 64-year-old Pam Bissett, gave her the idea to start a foundation to help women with breast cancer. Steadman is battling stage stage four cancer and says, \"I will never be in remission. My cancer will never go away. I will never be cancer free.\" But, despite that, Steadman, who was born and raised in Tampa, says she's actually very lucky. \"It means that time is precious. It's a beautiful gift that I am just blessed each and every day that I get to see my family and wake up my children and get them off to school.\" Steadman was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2004. She had a bilateral mastectomy and thought the cancer was gone. She says, \"My doctor had indicated that I had a less than one percent chance of it coming back or a reoccurrence. So, in 2007, I was very surprised to find out that my cancer had come back.\" The cancer is now attacking her vertebra, bones and her lymph nodes. Despite that, she and her friends started a foundation to help advance clinical research for breast cancer and help patients that are enrolled in clinical trials. Steadman was enrolled in an intense clinical trial at Johns Hopkins for eight months and says, \"We have funded this vaccine trial that Doctor Leisha Emens has created at Johns Hopkins. We've given them $25,000.\" Click here to read more about the clinical trial being conducted at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center. The foundation's goal is to also help offset some of the patient's expenses when taking part in clinical trials. The name of the foundation is Driving Miss Darby. Steadman explains how it works. \"They can call us and say, 'Hey, can you pick me up from the airport?' and I'm the driver. I say, 'Of course I can, let me come and get you.' I'll try to take them to breakfast and things like that, but really what we want to do is help offset that financial burden.\" Steadman says plane tickets, hotel rooms, cab fare and food can be expensive when patients are traveling to the site of the clinical trial each week for months. She says she got the idea for the foundation from when her mother would drive her to her appointments. Bissett, meanwhile, says she understands how critical clinical trials are not only for her daughter but for other women too. Bissett is also a breast cancer survivor. \"Without the trials, there's no new medicine coming out. These ladies give up a lot to go through a trial. They don't have a whole lot of time.\"",
