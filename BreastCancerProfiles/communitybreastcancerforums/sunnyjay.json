I start on the 20th and I tried to time my first infusion so that I still have most of my hair on Aug 5th, which is my sister's wedding. I have really thick, dark Asian hair that has been falling out a bunch over the last few years (due to perimenopause) but grows so fast. I cut my long straight hair to a short bob after surgery since I had a hard time putting it in a ponytail. It has already grown to almost shoulder length in just 6 weeks! So I'm hoping to be one of the lucky ones who keeps some of it intact (knocks on wood). Nevertheless, I'll be going wig shopping next week. Julia, The one thing you're doing that I'm not is the water aerobics or just consistent exercise in general. I'm pretty sure that has helped you with managing your side effects. I know I need to be more active, but sometimes just walking bothers my chest muscles near the expander. So I have to walk at a very leisurely pace, and I don't feel I'm getting my heart rate up. I used to do water aerobics many years ago and that school no longer offers it. But I'll figure something out. I've walked around the local park a few times during the holiday weekend so I'll keep that going. ",

My surgery was delayed about an hour since my potassium was low. So they had to insert some in the IV and when it was at an acceptable level my anesthesiologist gave me a relaxer. I knocked out before I even got to the operating room. When I woke up 4 hours had gone by and I was in recovery! The surgery went well I was told, and the sentinel lymph nodes were free of cancer. I'm still in the hospital but will go home later this afternoon. I have been on norcon for pain management but only once last night had some intense pain and high blood pressure so some medicine was added to my IV. But that made me nauseous & dizzy so I didn't want to use that drug again. Other than that, I'm fine. Blood pressure has come down and just feel lightheaded once in a while. Here are some recommendations based on my experience the last 24 hrs... Keep visitors to a minimum. I had someone with me all day yesterday. DH brought me to the hospital and stayed with me until the surgery. He had to leave for his dialysis at some point so my parents came by and were already in my room after recovery. When they left, one of my sisters came to keep me company until DH came back. It was nice to have them there. DH was also keeping my family and a few friends up to date with texts and pics throughout the day. Two of my girlfriends also wanted to come by and visit, and DH said it was ok. We didn't know that one of them would come with her family... of 5! I love her 3 girls but it was a little overwhelming that first day. Other recos: -Bring lozenges to suck on. I had cotton mouth all day, as well as a sore throat from the breathing tube. I didn't want to keep drinking water and have to get up to pee. -if you have to take prescription meds (I take high blood pressure meds), make sure to bring the bottle with the label. They didn't supply my diuretic and they wanted to verify the label with my info on file. -if your schedule allows it, take a mini vacation before surgery to relax your mind and release some anxiety. DH and I visited friends in Baltimore and spent a day in Washington DC sightseeing. I had surgery the day after we got back. That's all I can think of for now. Hope those who are having surgery today were successful! ",

But I still really want to be there since we're old friends, amd will be reunited with our group of friends from high school. I have to fly down to the wedding, so hoping the TE doesn't set off the body scanner. Anyone have any experience with TSA? Since I am really lopsided I need to either stuff my right breast or find some kind of push up adhesive fake bra. (I don't known what those things are called.)

But then he recommended tamoxifen (due to ER+) and T & C chemo 4 times every 3 weeks (because tumor was 2.5cm, considered not small). He didn't think radiation was necessary but referred me to a RO for consultation. He also showed me a model online of the 10 yr survival rate for someone with my same situation. Without the treatment the survival is 91%, and with the treatment the survival is 95%. This model does not figure for recurrence so he still encourages the adjuvant treatment. I shared my path with a friend of mine that works for a pharma company that is working on a drug for Her2+ patients. Since she works with a team of oncologists she offered to share the path results with a couple of them. Both said I didn't need chemo because the spread to the lymph node was only 1.5mm. So now I plan to seek a formal 2nd opinion. After the recommendation by the tumor board for chemo, I was set in my mind that I had to do this. But given the \"model\" and the opinions of the other MOs, I'm wondering if going through 12 weeks of side effects is worth the additional 4% survival rate. Edited to add: I didn't ask my MO whether there is a model for longer survival rate... I'm only 45 so I would like my survival rate to be at least 30 yrs!",

He told me that he got a call from pathology who was starting my path report and found some spread in one of the sentinel nodes. So I had to get the axillary nodes removed. Since I had just eaten (and had to be fasting for 8 hours) I had to wait until the following day (the 19th) to get this done. I've been home since the 20th, and the pain under my left armpit hasn't left. I had one drain removed last Wed and the 2nd drain removed on Fri but the pain hasn't subsided. I also have numbness in the back of my arm, between my elbow and my armpit. I also have some pain & chest pressure from the tissue expander. None of the pain & numbness I\"m feeling really goes away with the hydrocodone pain meds I was prescribed. I'm trying to wean myself from the pain meds by alternating with extra strength Tylenol and only taking the prescribed meds when I'm feeling extreme pain, usually in the evenings. I have a pretty high pain tolerance so this really sucks. I guess the good news is that I'm slowly gaining range of motion in my left arm. I have medium length hair and have been able to put it up in a back ponytail using both arms yesterday. Prior to this, I could only manage a low side ponytail by bringing all my hair to the left side minimizing my left arm movement. I have to yet receive my full path report but when I met with my surgeon last week he reported that the rest of the nodes were clear. Yay! However, he presented my case to the tumor board at my clinic and got a call from him on Friday, saying that the board unanimously decided that I would need to get chemo & possibly radiation afterwards. My oncologist (whom I have yet to meet) sits on this board, so we will discuss the details of my treatment when I meet with him in a couple of weeks. Because I have crappy veins, I will have to get a mediport placed soon. And, because I will likely need radiation, I won't be able to exchange for implants for about a year. I meet with my PS tomorrow to start filling the expander so I anticipate more chest pain in my near future.",

Where did you get the information to prepare for your treatments? Was it from these forums?

I have issues posting on my phone sometimes so my last post didn't make it on here. Anyway, here are a few updates... I had a bra fitting last week and it all went well. So happy to have something that feels somewhat comfortable. My insurance approved 2 post-surgery bras so I got a couple with pockets, so I can \"expand\" my right to match my left each time I get my TE filled. My PS also recommended a few Warners brand bras that I can get at macys, so I'll check them out after work. I have had 3 PT sessions now, and my range of motion has improved so much. I still have tightness in my armpit whenever I raise my arm and also in the crook of my arm when i extend my arm out. She said I had some cording but I can't see anything so she must be able to feel it internally. I have my last session this week and will be sad since she has helped me not only physically, but also helped with lots of resources in my area. Neither my PS, MO and Nurse Navigator discussed these resources with me. I feel like I have to seek these out on my own. This week I have my chemo teaching session and will start my first infusion in 2 weeks. Juliajazz, thanks so much for the information about chemo preparation. It has really helped! I think I will be getting the same regimen as you. I was trying to get a 2nd opinion, but all the information I have been reading points to chemo as THE recommended treatment for my situation. And my medical team has been wonderful up to this point, so I feel that I am in good hands.",

I'm feeling a little better about this now, hearing how well you are all doing within the first couple of days of surgery. I was just diagnosed at the end of March, and the weeks following have been a whirlwind of appointments. So I've had the last week to really let this all sink in. I'll be having a unilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction on the 17th so I'm nervous about the results of the biopsy and what the remainder of my treatment will be. My PS has given me different scenarios which I appreciate, so I'm expecting the worst but hoping for the best. My husband has taken time off from work for the first 2 weeks, but he has dialysis appointments 3 days a week. So I'm fortunate to have my parents live close enough that I can crash there during recovery. Since I'll be staying at my parents' place right after surgery, I showed my mom all the pre- and post-op paperwork I was given. She has already been checking up on me to make sure I've been following everything up to this point. I hope she will give me some breathing room to recover. LOL",

They could not put any creams beforehand and didn't want to inject anything prior because they didn't want to stick me 8 times. but there would be lidocaine on the needle. This whole dialogue didn't make me feel at ease. Before the radiologist came in to do the procedure, she put a stress ball in one hand and said she would hold my other hand. I was really anxious by this time! The radiologist came in and explained what he was going to do, and said it would be really quick and I would just feel a tiny sting. And he was right! I was stressed over something really minor. The first 3 were like a tiny pinch, and the last one was more painful than the others, but felt more like a deep needle poke during a blood draw.

My hair was still really short to do any kind of trimming, but she encouraged me to go without a wig. I still wasn't comfortable without the wig so I walked out of there without the wig, but was so self-conscious the rest of the day that I wore my wig the very next day and for the next 2 months. I still have hair that falls out whenever I just touch my hair so I considered using biotin to strengthen the roots and follicles to reduce the amount of hair falling out. I don't if I heard this from someone or just making it up. LOL hapi2bee, Thanks for the compliment! I am still not used to my short hair even though it's been a couple of months now without the wig. I have a bit of gray also, but I'm going to wait until it grows out more before I color it. My hair looks thick, but strands keep falling out, so I'm thinking it will thin out like yours did. Lupsters and Paintersdream, if you don't have or like the wigs the cancer center has, find a regular wig store in your area. I was fortunate that a wig shop recently closed and donated a bunch of wigs to the cancer center in my area so I had a bunch to choose from. Pre-chemo, my hair was naturally straight with layers so it seemed to be a common style with the synthetic wigs. I tried a human hair wig, and I didn't like the way it sat on my head. I bought one online at Godiva's Secret Wigs, and it had a nice feel to it and it was very light. They seem to have sales all the time, so you might want to check them out. Paintersdream, thanks for the tips on managing the curls. I don't have much patience with air drying, but I will try your method. I have the wild bushy hair right now. It might seem endless when you're starting treatment. I started chemo a year and 1 month ago, and had radiation following. Time has flown and it seems like a distant memory now. The only thing left for me (other than tamoxifen for the next 5 years) is reconstruction which will happen at the end of this year or early next year. So keep the faith, and you'll get through this!

During chemo I started shampooing with Nioxin 3, and my hair grew steadily. Once I finished the bottle I didn't buy another, and just started using a sulfate- and paraben- free shampoo. But the growth has slowed down so I'm considering using Nioxin again. Or maybe trying biotin. I wore wigs mostly until month 8 PFC and desperately went to a stylist to help with styling tips. She trimmed the length and layered the back to give my hair some shape. The top was still short and since I wanted to grow my hair out my stylist didn't want to touch it. I had this done on the first day of summer, so I told everyone it was my new summer look. ;) Very few people know that I went through chemo. I only wore scarves as a casual look on the weekends or when working out. So this new hairstyle was a dramatic change to my everyday look. I wasn't super excited about it but I was so ready to ditch the wigs for summer. I feel like I am always having a bad hair day because I am not good at manipulating the chemo curls. I have watched youtube videos about styling short hair but mine looks nothing like theirs. My hair pre-diagnosis was straight, shoulder length or longer, and thick. Now, it's growing in thicker than I expected but is so wavy. I don't know how to style curly hair. I use gel like crazy just to give it a sleek or wet look amd spray the roots at the top to give it some height. When I don't try to style it my hair is all over the place and I feel like Ronald McDonald! Hahaha Even though I have this love/hate relationship with my hair, I am just happy it is finally growing in. As much as I want my old hair back, I will probably try a pixier cut since my hair is already short. I have an appointment next week so I'll let you know what I decide to do. Iz1999 - My hair falls out a lot... Not the handfuls I was getting during chemo but hairs would fall out during shampooing or just running my fingers through my hair. Pre-diagnosis my hair was prone to falling out when brushing and shampooing, but I can't tell if it's more or less now since my hair is much shorter. I am taking Tamoxifen so that may be why. Hope you find out what's causing yours. Before I go, here's me 2 weeks ago... he day after my 47th birthday! ",

I think my last post was regarding an infection I had in my mastectomy breast. The culture my PS took several weeks ago was negative for any infection so she figured it was just a skin/surface irritation. So chemo was paused for a few weeks so this can clear up. It was just a wait and see situation since neither my PS or MO knew what this was. It was frustrating to say the least. I even suggested a referral to a dermatologist but my PS was against it because they won't know if it is related to the implant. The oral antibiotics helped a little for the first 10 days. I also was prescribed bactroban, a topical antibiotic, which has helped the most. I also stormed heaven with prayers since I was really worried when there was no immediate improvement from the oral antibiotics. The redness (or pinkness actually) had gone away after the first week and hasn't come back. The irritation has been slowly improving so I was given the OK for chemo this week. Yay! I just really want to get this over with.... So I start cycle 3 of TC tomorrow. My PS is hoping the chemo doesn't reactivate this thing and make it worse. So am I! Also, this week I started an exercise program called \"Living strong, living well\". It's a 12 week guided program for cancer patients and you go twice a week. We just had orientation yesterday and will do some fitness tests tomorrow to see where everyone's level is at. I was debating whether to go after treatment tomorrow (I have about 2 hours in between) but since I'll be on steroids it should be doable... 😉 Hope everyone's doing well.

I had my 3rd TC infusion on Thursday and have been on the steroids, so SEe have been minimal so I got so much done the last couple of days. We'll see how things go today now that I'm off the steroids. I hope my SE stays minimal since we'll be going to the Hall & Oates/Tears for Fears concert tonight. This was the event my hubby had surprised me with for my bday in July but the promoters postponed it, and tonight's the night! This last infusion cycle I have also had really bad bladder control! I ended up buying the Always bladder control pads for slight leaking. Ugh! But I only leak when I'm already in the restroom in front if the toilet which is so weird. Maybe it's a psychological thing that my body knows I'm about to go and just releases. LOL And since I'm already at the toilet there's no big mess. I also started the LiveStrong program last week. But here it's called \"Living Strong, Living Well\". It's administered by Stanford and this program is local to the YMCA in the Northern CA region but the description is similar -- 12 week guided training program. One of our trainers is working towards a certification for cancer-specific personal training. So I'm glad to bein good hands. This week was just orientation of the gym and learning about the machines we will be using. Yesterday I had a 1 on 1 session to figure out my specific training needs regarding weight load and introduced to the treadmill and bicycles. I haven't been to our local Y before so I'm so happy to see that they have so many group classes, racquetball AND both and indoor & outdoor pool. So I'll definitely be checking out all the services with this temporary membership they offered during this program. I was a gym rat many moons ago, and I am really excited to get back into my fitness... Slowly for now, of course! ",

I saw my oncologist on Friday and he told me to wear the sleeve for several hours a day, so as of last weekend the swelling has not gone down. So I have an appointment to see my PT next week. I never noticed the swelling until it was pointed out to me. My rings still fit until the hives breakout and now I feel the tightness on the back of my hand (the swollen area). My left hand is also my dominant hand/arm, so it is really hard for me to get used to doing things with my right arm. but I am being very conscientious of that now. I can't really tell if the rest of my arm is swollen and there's no tightness in my forearm. My elbow to my armpit is still numb from the surgery (and has always been pretty flabby LOL) so I'll leave it to the professionals to diagnose lymphedema (LE). Hopefully LE will be reversible.",

I left my Hydro Flask water bottle in a friend's car last weekend and that has been my security blanket throughout this bc ordeal. So ive been so lost all week without it! I known I need to drink lots of fluids to remove the chemo meds from my system. Regular bottled water is not cutting it since it doesn't stay cold. Ugh, I'm just ranting because the hot flashes SE are starting. Haha Paulette: A similar thing happened to me on my first Docetaxol/Taxotere infusion. My nurse started it slow since it was my first time. My face felt flushed after the first 10 minutes so she slowed it down more. It helped and I was better the next time. Hope the next time will be better for you! ",

I think my episodes are due to inner ear inflammation which usually happens to me after a cold. I had a slight cold a few weeks ago and I think it was aggravated by the air travel a couple of weekends ago since my ears still feel plugged. During rads I feel a vertigo episode come on when I'm lying on the table and they move me up & down to get me in place, or when the rads machines are moving around me. So I just fix my eyes on something on the machine or the ceiling and it goes away. I had rads #4 yesterday and I feel like the techs are still figuring out my position. I wonder if this is normal. They keep adjusting the table, scooting me up, down, left or right, marking the spots on my body even though I already have the tattoos marked. After each adjustment they say, Perfect! Then after looking at the monitor someone comes back and makes another adjustment. \"Right there... That's perfect!\" This happens at least 3 times before they start the treatment. Man, 24 more days of this... I am 5 weeks PFC and my hair growth is just like tpralph. My hair is naturally black so I hope the gray grows out also. Pre-chemo I had some grays but definitely not this much! I like seeing the posts about all your exercise efforts. It is really inspiring! I had to discontinue the LiveStrong program since my rads time coincided with the workout times. I still can use the temporary YMCA membership until the program officially ends so I need to motivate myself to get out there. Since I didn't have issues with appetite during treatment, I put on extra pounds (I'm blaming all the steroids I had to take - Haha) and need to get rid of them.  ",

For those that have already had an infusion or two, how well are you eating? I know this is a silly question, but my husband and I are big foodies. We like getting together with friends on the weekends to try new restaurants, different cuisines, etc. So this is going to be a huge change for us, since we are in this together. I am already anticipating that I will have an aversion to foods that I love, and will be eating porridge or chicken soup for the next 12 weeks. Hahaha I just started reading \"The Cancer-fighting Kitchen\" which gives different ideas and recipes to help manage various side effects. But some of the recipes seem daunting for someone like me that comes home late from work, boils a pot of pasta, pours sauce over it and calls it a meal. LOL I actually love to cook from recipes but is not something I can do every day. What are you all eating, and is there anything that you found that helps with the side effects?",

I have a habit of looking up procedures so I know what to expect. Well, I am happy to report that my experience wasn't as traumatic as others seem to be. It maybe because I have a high pain threshhold. But I have to really give credit to my infusion nurse. She made the whole procedure relatively painless. She started the taxotere in increments of slow to regular drips to make sure I didn't have any reactions... first 12cc slow, then 30cc a little more, then the rest at a normal rate. She will ask for an EMLA prescription for my next round, but honestly I didn't feel the poke since she numbed the site with ice. I was able to eat a 1/2 turkey sandwich for lunch and a little pasta salad, and I haven't felt nauseous. I do have a little bloating so I at a couple of crystallized ginger pieces. I also just had a snack a couple hours after lunch (Almond bar from Trader Joes made with flax, poppy, sunflower, sesame & pumpkin seeds and almonds). I took a compazine 6 hours after my infusion, and have been monitoring my blood pressure and temperature, and writing everything down! I'm heading to Wal-Mart (5 min away) for Biotene in case I develop mouth sores in the next couple of days and that Nail Envy stuff that I've seen discussed in other threads. And probably get pho noodle soup for dinner while I can still keep food down. Then probably wrap up my evening watching the Giants baseball game or binge watching something on Netflix. Tomorrow I get the Neulasta shot and have Claritin at the ready! Wishing good thoughts for you tomorrow, and anyone else starting a new cycle in the coming days. ",

But last night, the bone pain started up again. So around 2 am I took Claritin and took my temp. It was 100.4°! I had been instructed to call if it was 100.5. I freaked out and took Tylenol to see if the fever would go down. It did eventually, but the body aches didn't. I was able to get back to sleep but then woke up drenched in sweat. I called the on-call doctor and he said the bone pain may last up to 10 days after Neulasta, and advised me to take Tylenol or Advil. Since he was no help, I decided to wait until my MO's office opened and call again. The nurse was concerned that the pain lasted this long but couldn't offer additional remedies. I told her about the fever and night sweats, and she consulted my MO for further recommendations. If it doesn't subside in the next day or two then he may prescribe stronger pain meds. I guess if they don't need me to come in then it shouldn't be all that bad. The hot flashes continued all day and fatigue also got the best of me.

Regarding your nausea, have you tried to relieve it with crystallized ginger candy or ginger tea? You can make your own tea by boiling raw ginger for 20 min or until it reaches the desired strength. Add honey for flavor. I have also used peppermint oil with coconut as my carrier oil and rub it on my belly whenever I feel bloated. I didn't think to try it for constipation but it may help move things along. Others here have used Smooth Move tea, so that may help if your local grocery store has that. Hope you feel better soon!",

It was my first time using any of their services, and let me tell you... This place rocks!! I walked in without an appointment and the staff was so eager to help me. They brought me to \"The Boutique\", which is like a huge walk-in closet with a vanity. She pulled out the dark hair bin and most were short and curly. I have straight, dark, thick Asian hair. The only one with straight hair was a funky asymmetrical cut. So I was getting discouraged... But the girl that helped me went to go \"check in the back\". She comes back with a sack of dark hair wigs and I found several with straight hair and similar to my length! Apparently, a wig shop owner recently downsized or is closing, and donated a bunch of wigs. they haven't had a chance to store them in the boutique area. The ones I loved she said I could take... All 3! Next she pulled out a bin with sleeping caps and scarves, and told me to take a few. Wow... It felt like Christmas! In the meantime, my hair continued to fall out. I had some fun with my 11-year old niece. I pulled out one strand, then another few strands, and pretended to be shocked each time I pulled out more. She was watching me and was tripping out, and finally yelled, \"stop doing that!\" Haha She's like the daughter I never had, so we share our feelings... and a lot of laughs. Wish you all a good weekend! Paulettek, will be thinking of you tomorrow and hoping for minimal SEs this weekend. Lojo, glad to hear that your regimen will be changed. You, the runners, and the others on their dreadmills keep inspiring me to get on a fitness program and just start walking. I just added a reminder in my calendar to get my butt moving.

I used one when trying on wigs at the cancer center but didn't think to ask to take one home. So over the weekend, I've been using the wig over what hair I had left and it felt like it would slip off. Yesterday, I went to the Look Good Feel Better class, and the instructor kept touching my \"hair\" to get my bangs out of my face when doing the eye makeup. I felt the wig slipping. Last night, I bought a wig liner at the local Sally Beauty Supply and it has made so much of a difference with keeping the wig stationary. And today, no slippage, thanks to the magical liner! It looks like the foot part of a nylon stocking, but it's reinforced at the edges. I got black to match my dark wig. But I think I'll get a nude color that matches my scalp to have a more natural looking part show through the wig.  Jenruns: Love the hat! I missed it earlier since I usually read these messages on my email, and the emails don't show the photos. I want to find a nice hat, but I don't really like how I look in hats.

One of my favorite aunts passed away on 2/28 from pancreatic cancer, and we just laid her to rest on Saturday. She was diagnosed in mid-October and despite her body rejecting food, fluids, chemo, she had several miracles throughout her journey. She wasn't supposed to make it through the holidays, but we are thankful she did. I didn't want to see my cousins be without their mom during the holidays. She visited me right after my bc surgery, so it was hard to have the tables turned, and be the one visiting her in the same wing at the same hospital. I was thinking about this group a couple of weeks ago when I attended a BC conference in San Francisco, and started to wonder how you were all doing. It was a great conference put on by the Cancer Prevention Institute of California, and most of the talks were related to survivorship and local resources. It's an annual conference, and I just found out about it a month before, so I was glad I was available to attend. I'm not involved in any BC survivor groups locally, but I'll start looking for one just so that I have like-minded ladies to chat with regularly. I do attend a weekly movement class at my clinic, specifically for cancer survivors. It's an hour and a half on a Saturday morning of various exercises (from yoga & tai-chi to weights & jazzercise). And the best part is that we are exercising to live music! A gentleman brings his keyboard, guitar and amp and plays all the music. It is a blast! I've met with my MO twice since I finished rads, and the appointments have been non issues. I don't have any major symptoms that he is concerned about, so I don't have to see him until end of May. At that time he'll schedule the mammogram, since he wants me to wait 6 months post-rads. He said I can get the port removed, so I have to get that scheduled. Then get together with my PS to figure out the reconstruction schedule. Life's been slowly getting back to normal, so I'm really dragging my feet on these surgeries because that means I'll have to go through the healing process again... Teese, how did your surgery go last week? Hope all went well and you're recovering with no major issues. Runnermum, I'm on tamoxifen also and haven't had any major SEs other than fatigue and hot flashes, which hits me at the weirdest times. I saw my MO a month ago (6 weeks after I started), and he said I may feel more SEs later as I progress with the medication. Great...",

Then when this infection happened, she kept apologizing that she didn't do anything for the earlier pinkness. She was relieved when it turned out not to be an internal infection, but still perplexed at what may have caused it. So just keep watching the surgery areas and if anything looks amiss, ask about it. I had started with dryness in this area so I applied lotion. Then it started peeling like a sunburn so I thought it was getting better. But then it turned purple and that's when I said something. So maybe the lotion irritated it? Who knows... My infusions are every 3 weeks for a total of 4 infusions. So I'll be 75% done after tomorrow. Then my last cycle will be 10/5 if there are no further setbacks. Sounds like your SE with Taxol are more manageable. Are you also getting Neulasta? I think that's common for any of the taxane drugs (Taxotere & Taxol). The SE from Neulasta are what hit me the hardest (Taxotere is one of my chemo drugs).",

I got my drain out a week after my surgery and the wounds healed well. One of my best friends got married in June, so I had to find a dress that would mask my uneven breasts. I was also starting to get the tissue expander filled, so I had one perky and one saggy breast. DH and I would get a laugh whenever I tried on an outfit and they looked so lopsided! LOL Paulettek - Regarding the LE, just do what makes you feel comfortable if that means ripping off the bandage. We can only handle so much physically and emotionally, so if it means focusing on just chemo for now, then do that. I ended up getting a compression sleeve since I started this Livestrong program. I was told that it would help prevent LE for those that are at risk. Well, when I got fitted the guy taking my measurements noticed that my left hand (surgery side) was a little swollen compared to my right hand. I was so devastated! I only wore the sleeve when I work out because it's the kind that includes the gauntlet (for the hand) so it's hard to do anything with it on. Now I want to see my PT to make sure this doesn't progress further. I just wonder if I started getting to the gym to soon. I realize I didn't get clearance from my MO to start this workout program, and now that I'm starting to get lymphedema and the hives I'm wondering if I did too much too soon. Oh, and I also have this cough, sometimes dry and sometimes phleghm-y, that I think is due to allergies. It comes and goes during the day. So i usually just take a Ricola lozenge and that helps. Since the hydroxyzine is an antihistimine, it has helped with the cough too... I see my MO tomorrow to assess the hives situation. It was spreading to different parts of my body the last few days, but as of right now, most of the rash is gone. But every once in a while, I get a really itchy spot and just want to keep scratching. I've been eating as minimum as I can handle and trying to eat clean with no chocolate, no seafood, no nuts until the hives get cleared. I do not need another setback before my final chemo session next week. My feet tend to be swollen when I get home from work. I'm sitting at a desk all day and try to put my feet up throughout the days I still have some minor swelling and my toes ache. I've been icing them when I get home and that seems to help but still have the neuropathy feeling. I will try the epsom salt. I think I have a foot bath in the garage somewhere that I should start using.",

I'm so glad I'm doing the Live Strong program so I at least get some activity during the week. I do get updates by email so I do read how everyone is doing throughout the week. Loved seeing all the pet pics this week! A bunch of us in my family have allergies to dander so I grew up with no pets. I have since outgrown the allergy, but I've never had the opportunity to be a furmom... My husband has had pets his whole life. He has a Lab that has been staying with his dad who lives alone. He is a great companion to my FIL, so he'll stay there for now. Teese, I'm hoping my lymphedema is also temporary since it's just my hand that's swollen. I can't tell with the rest of my arm, but it did measure 1/2 - 1 cm more than my last measurements that were taken when I had PT after surgery. I got so excited last week when the swelling went down a little, but this past week I had no such luck. My PT said it could be that my body is still adjusting to life after chemo. I am 2 weeks PFC as of yesterday, so hopefully my body can get adjusted and get this swelling down. She gave me a prescription for a glove since my fingers are a bit swollen. They're not as puffy as they were a few weeks ago, but sill not able to wear my rings on my left hand. She also mentioned that rads may aggravate LE, so I'm not looking forward to that. Speaking of rads, I will meet with the RO next week. My MO initially thought I might not need rads but referred me to the RO back in June just to consult with him. That was when he told me I was a borderline case. This RO will be on sabbatical, so I get to meet a new RO. I'm going to treat this as a 2nd opinion and will ask him to go through everything with me again. So we'll see what he says. I still have some neuropathy on my feet, more so on my toes than the balls of my feet which I felt before. So it seems like it has reduced from when I was active with chemo. Hopefully it will eventually go away. Jen, hope you're feeling better today. Enjoy your birthday weekend and hope it includes some time to relax! :) Paulette, I've been trying to eat clean and cut carbs and sugar, but it's so hard! I just take it one day at a time, and most days I do ok. Hope you can figure out what to eat to boost WBC. My labs in the past before bc would show lower than normal WBC, but I was never given any suggestions how to increase it. Hope those that had infusions today have minimal SEs this weekend.",

Glad to see/hear about all the bell-ringing since my clinic didn't have a bell to ring... but I am happy to say I'm 3 weeks PFC as of today! I met with my new RO today and he was very thorough with his explanation as to why he agrees with the recommendation from my first RO (who is now on sabbatical). I had some runaway cancer cells in my lymph node that escaped AKA extra-nodal spread, so the radiation will help kill those cells in case they were not removed during surgery. He also wants to target the lymph nodes that were not removed (so near my collarbone) to reduce the chance of any spread. So I do the simulation on Monday and we'll figure out the treatment schedule from there. I'll be doing 28 days so it will span Thanksgiving, but at least will be done before Christmas. I'm glad to read about your rads experiences here and happy to hear that no one has had complications. I'll check out the Oct Rads thread also to see how I need to prepare. I'm not looking forward to my lymphedema possibly getting worse with rads. I wear a sleeve daily now, as well as a compression glove since most of the swelling is at the back of my hand. I really hope that the swelling is temporary. This weekend, DH & I are doing the Making Strides Against Breast Cancer 5K walk, so I'm looking forward to that. We did this in previous years in memory of my Mother in law, but the last time was probably 5 years ago. We did a practice walk last week to see if we can last for the entire 5K and we were able to make it from start to finish. Since my surgery in May, I haven't really walked more than 2 miles at a time, and wasn't walking regularly. So I was happy to get through it. I think that since the walk takes place in the downtown area, there are a lot of sights to keep me distracted from any aches and pains. Plus, we'll have my girlfriend and her family join us, as well as one of my sisters & my niece, so it will be fun! My DH planned a post-chemo getaway for us next weekend. He is keeping it under wraps, so I have no idea where we are going. I'm the one that usually plans our vacations, so I'm itching not knowing how to prepare. haha Since we're flying somewhere, he'll have to tell me sooner or later so I know what to pack.",

Whenever I tell someone about my experience with BC they can't believe how upbeat I am about it. I guess when people hear \"cancer\" they always think it's all gloom and doom. And I thought the same thing before I was diagnosed. I learned a lot from these forums about what to expect and how to deal with the hand we're dealt with. I am thinking of joining a support group in my area as well. Maybe after rads, I'll try and find a BC survivors group. With work and the daily rads schedule makes it hard to do anything else. I've already had to change my rads schedule several times to accommodate work meetings. I'm so glad the rads center has been flexible with finding me an alternate time, even if it's early in the morning. My sessions are usually mid-afternoon, so I just take my lunch break later. ",

I didn't have a bell to ring, but when they finished my session, the streaming music stopped and there was a trumpet fanfare. it made me laugh and happy to be done! My skin ended up being dark and pink and the area where I have the tissue expander is really sore and sensitive. I'm anticipating more side effects for the next couple of weeks. My RO added Aquaphor to my arsenal. He advised to stop the aloe, and move forward with calendula cream during the day and aquaphor before bed. He anticipates my skin may get worse since my armpit started to get irritated. I've been wearing a bra this whole time, but now that the area is so sensitive, I think I will have to forgo the bra and just use camis or tank tops until it heals. I also have to really take the time to stretch my chest throughout the day to relieve the tightness. But otherwise, this went better than expected up to this point. Leatherette, great hair growth!

The 1st nurse who tried, joked saying, It's a good thing you're having a port put in! And I replied, this is EXACTLY why I'm doing this! It was pretty funny until the 2nd nurse who is supposed to be a pro tried 3 times, and started apologizing each time she had to stick me. Once the IV was in place, I waited for an hour before I finally got moved to the OR. When I got to the OR, no one was in there. The nurse found out the doctor/radiologist got a call that was supposed to be \"really quick\", so I had to wait another 20 min or so. By this time half of my IV drip was done so naturally, I had to use the bathroom. So they had to wheel me out. When I got back, I had to wait another 20 min before the doctor finally arrived. At least they had Michael Buble music playing in the room... By then, I was all prepped and ready. I was awake during the procedure, but they placed a drape over my face so I didn't participate in their vacation conversation. Since I was not very talkative, they thought I was napping. The procedure itself was pretty quick, and I'm so glad that ordeal is over. When I first arrived and was getting prepped (before the IV was placed), one of the nurses tried to reassure me about the surgery and said, \"This is going to be the easiest part of your journey!\" Now that I think about what she said, all I can do is laugh and hope the rest of the journey gets better.

I have read elsewhere that certain vitamins may have an adverse benefit to chemo, but my MO said it should be ok. Also, I asked about eating big meal prior to infusion since a few of you mentioned it. I wanted to make sure there was nothing I couldn't eat that would also affect the chemo drugs. My nurse said I should definitely eat beforehand, and said I could even eat during my infusion. I just thought it would be weird to eat a Denny's Grand Slam in front of the other patients. Ha! ",

Starting Taxotere now... Should be another couple of hours and I can enjoy the rest of my day. ",

Teese, You are the best Mother Hen around... keeping tabs on everyone the way you do makes me so happy to be part of your \"coop\". Since hubby was released from the hospital a couple of days ago, I didn't want him driving around so I was his chauffeur today. Good thing the nasty side effects didn't come back. However, I do have a new one to report... dry mouth! I have been using the biotene to keep the mouth sores away, which seems to be working but did not keep the dry mouth away. I've been chewing gum all day which created saliva, but the dryness seemed to get worse, like when you eat something tart and makes it dry. It's kind of a weird feeling. I am sucking on a sore throat lozenge right now which seems to be helping, and I've been drinking a lot of water. I've also been feeling more winded when I go for my walks. We visited my father-in-law today, and took his dog for a walk around the cul-de-sac. Just glad I got out for a bit. Like others, Aunt Flo made visited me today, so I guess \"chemopause\" for us pre-menopause girls hasn't hit yet. Ha! Have a good weekend!",

I think in my last post I was about to travel to Vegas for DH's bday weekend. Considering we're not huge gamblers we had a blast taking in all types of entertainment. As we were getting ready to go home, my hubby found out that his sister had a stroke. So the following weekend we traveled to Los Angeles to visit her. Thank God it was a mild stroke. Her speech improved just in the few days we were there, and was able to walk on her own. So she is expected to recover, slowly but surely. When we were visiting with her, she had friends (a couple) visiting at the same time. I leaned that in the last couple of years, the husband had suffered a stroke and the wife had a heart issue. But what stood out to me was their positivity! They didn't let their disabilities bring them down. They kept encouraging my sister in law to keep a great attitude, and not to stress over little things. They also had a great sense of humor that lifted up her spirits. I tried my best to stay positive throughout this journey, and couldn't have made it through without BCO and especially all of you. In about a month it will be a year since my diagnosis. So that means I'll be getting my mammo done soon. I'll also ask for an ultrasound if that's not part of the protocol. Are there any other tests I should ask for? Hope everyone is doing well and adjusting to our new normal...",

Clynne, welcome to the group!  I didn't have any major abdominal issues during treatment, but like Jen I still have some lingering neuropathy from chemo. I have been busy with work as well, so haven't been around the boards lately.  I met with an oncology dietitian a few weeks ago since I gained some weight during treatment (most likely from the steroids), and haven't been able to take it off.  I have been so lazy about implementing a good diet and exercise program on my own, so she's given me some guidelines to start. I'm still working on it but at least I'm more conscious about what I eat and how much.  My clinic also provides a movement class for cancer patients and survivors every Saturday mornings so I've been doing that for the last couple of weeks. It has awoken a lot of my muscles!  This has motivated me to do more exercise during the week.   Hope everyone is doing well...  Since the posts here are sporadic, I'm hoping that NO news is GOOD news.  :) Have a great weekend!",

OCDAmy: Regarding the tissue expanders, my PS told me that there is a possibility that it may shrink a little. My RO didn't say anything about them. I had my first treatment yesterday and didn't have to get a pregnancy test (I'm 46 so still premenopausal). I also just finished chemo and they emphasized not getting pregnant during treatments, so maybe they just assumed I wouldn't be?? EmmyEdward: I was told to only use aloe 2-3 times a day by the rad nurse and to moisturize, moisturize, moisturize. She said the same thing about not using other ointments until the symptoms appear and they would give me samples of the ointments at that time. My PT had mentioned starting to use the aloe a week before I started treatment, but I totally forgot. The info about applying it to your back area is interesting. I might try that. I was supposed to start on Tuesday, but at that appointment, the tech said they had to take pictures and they did more mapping that I thought was already done during the simulation last week. At the simulation there was only 1 tech, and at the mapping session there were 3 techs. I didn't get a treatment, so they had to add another treatment day to the end. My last day keeps getting closer to Christmas week... Boo! Anyway, I had my first treatment yesterday and they told me that the RO wants me to do bolus every other day. So today I have to do mapping for that too. My RO never mentioned this at our initial meeting, so I need to clarify this with him when I see him next week. I hope I get a treatment after they do the mapping today. The actual treatment seemed longer than 5 minutes. I think it's because they're still trying to get the position right. They kept moving me this way and that, then marking me in certain spots. Since they're doing my left side (heart side), I have to do a breathing technique where I breathe through my chest and hold my breath from anywhere between 5-10 seconds. I have a hard time with this because when you're lying down and you take a deep breath, your chest doesn't usually expand. It's usually the stomach. The 10 second one seemed like it lasted forever! I really felt like bursting, but I was able to hold on. I have 27 more of these... Lord, help me! LOL",

The time it takes to get me in the right position takes longer than the treatment itself. Is this normal? Also, vertigo is triggered when the machine moves around me.

LOL Leatherette: So sorry to hear about your MIL. I'll be praying for your family and the strength to get through everything. Re: weight loss... I have been doing the opposite. I have gained 7 lbs since the start of treatment! I feel so fat lately and my clothes haven't been feeling right. My taste buds are way off, so everything tastes bland to me. So I feel like I'm always eating. I'm really bad with snacking too. Chips and bread are my weakness. The upside is that I started this Living Strong exercise program. The first actual workout was yesterday and I got in 20 min of cardio and strength training. Until yesterday, I had not done any consistent exercising, always making excuses (fatigue, getting winded, etc). But when I was walking on the treadmill I felt none of that. Mind over matter, I guess! I had my #3 TC infusion last week. During previous infusions, I had major bone pain on day 5. This time, it was a lot better. I was thinking that it would be worse since chemo is supposed to be cumulative (??), but I took Aleve this time and I think that made all the difference. However, this time around, I had tummy issues SE yesterday. I had a good BM in the morning and by mid-morning diarrhea hit me. I took imodium and was better by the time I had to go to the gym. I still have this bloated feeling though. After a month and a half of dealing with hair shedding, I finally shaved my head the other night! I don't know why I held off for so long... Maybe because it was something I was able to control somewhat. All my hair had not fallen out but I was looking like Beetlejuice with the messy, thin strands that were left. My brother did the deed, and I didn't want to get a super close shave due to the possibility of irritation, so I mostly have peach fuzz all over. Now I have to get used to the feeling of wearing my wig over the baldness. When I had hair, I would use a wig cap to hold in the longer strands, but today I went commando! Hahaha I use a wig gripper to hold the wig in place, but without the wig cap the top of my head tickles against the wig. ",

I live about 2 hours away from the Nor Cal fires in Napa and the smoke has traveled to our area making air quality really bad. I don't have asthma but started wheezing earlier this week. I think the chemo side effects aggravated it. It has been so depressing watching all that's been happening on the news, and as much as I want to drive up there and help out I know I have to prioritize my health. After my last TC infusion a week ago, my bone pain lasted longer than usual. Aleve helped manage the pain better than Tylenol. I also have tingling in my feet, more in my toes so I'll pick up some glutamine this weekend. For those fighting fatigue I just realized that moving helps. I forced myself to go to the gym twice this week since I'm doing the LiveStrong program and just getting on the treadmill for 20 min at a leisurely pace helped with my fatigue. A new SE came up for me this week: peeling skin! My hands have been drier and peeling like I have dried glue on my hands. It's not painful or blistering, but it's very annoying. It maybe that I'm not drinking enough water this time around. I also went back to my PT this week to diagnose the swelling of my left hand (surgery side). She took measurements and it looks like I have started to develop lymphedema. 😞 My arm measurements were about 1 cm more than it was 4 months ago so it's not only my hand that is affected. I can't tell just by looking at it so I'm glad I went to see her. Now I have to manage it by doing lymphatic draining massage daily to move fluid around to other lymph nodes. She said the swelling may also be partially chemo related since the steroid may cause fluid retention so we'll see if it goes down in the next week or so. I have been pretty private about my bc so only a handful of people outside my family know. But I am participating in the ACS Making Strides Against Breast Cancer walk at the end of the month. So last night I posted a link on FB to my fundraising page which shares my story for BC Awareness month. I know everyone's FB timelines are filled with news about the fires in the area so we'll see how much interaction my post will get. Sorry for the long post but it's been a crazy week and wanted to update you all. Have a great weekend everyone!",

Whenever I feel I am getting back to my pre-bc self, I only have to look in the mirror or under my shirt to realize things are now different. I have to really think about what I put in my mouth, how much weight I can carry on my surgery side (to not aggravate Lymphedema), and how much I can do in a given day before fatigue sets in. The other day I tried to go shopping and, in less than 10 minutes of walking around, I started feeling dizzy and overwhelmed. Other than my mother-in-law, I'm the only one among my family and close friends that have been/are going through this. So none of us knows what to do. My MIL lived 60 miles away so I saw her maybes once a month amd she was always in good spirits. I know as much as my medical team tells me, and always follow their advice. But they don't tell us about the emotions we would go through. We have a nurse navigator that's supposed to guide us through all this, but she was only there when I needed help with my surgery decision. I haven't heard from her since. But I'm so happy to have found this site to help me through all this. My friends have been a great support and always check on me. But no one outside of here knows what we're feeling. I am trying to \"rejoin normal life\"... Especially this time of year I sing with different choir groups for various Christmas concerts and masses. Even though I feel well, I know I'm still recovering and have to finish rads. So I've had to pick and choose what I can and can't do which is hard, because my old self wants to do it all. Singing is my passion and Christmas is \"the most wonderful time of the year\", so it's tough to have to say No to things I've been doing for the last 10 years or so. But it is what I need to do for myself to heal. I know there will be those who don't know what Ive been through and will probably think I'm being lazy. Since I'm \"so young\" (at age 46) and don't have kids, I should have the energy to do what they (in their 60s with grandkids) should be able to do... It can be hurtful, but I don't play the cancer card. I'll just let them think whatever they want. It's not worth my energy to have to explain why I do what I do. ",

Although, I actually found that going to Macys an hour or so before they close is less busy. :) I wanted to exchange some stuff I bought online, so I took my chance and went later in the evening, and there was no line at all! I'm glad to read you all posting about your exercise. I have been walking during the weekends, but during the week it's been hard to get it done.

Hopefully, it doesn't get too bad for the rest of the sessions... My lymphedema has not gotten worse like my RO said it might get, but I did notice last night that my arm was a little more swollen than usual. But after I did MLD, the swelling went down.

Paulette, I just noticed over the weekend that my eyebrows are growing! I didn't realize it because I've gotten used to just drawing them in every day. I also use Wunderbrow that takes a few days to fade so I didn't realize the growth until I gave them a good scrubbing and realized there was hair! Continue with the LE pump because I was told rads may cause flare-ups. I haven't had a major flare-up since rads started, but I notice my hand and arm is more swollen during the day. My PT wants to meet with me after rads to see how my LE held up. LoJo, I pray that the fires are contained soon. I'm in the SF bay area, and during the Napa fires, our air quality was pretty bad. Thankfully, I don't have asthma, but I did notice that my breathing was affected whenever I would be outside. I haven't watched the news in the last day or so, but I heard the fires were moving north. Hope it doesn't reach your area. So far, rads has made my tissue expander feel tighter than usual. I don't know if wearing a bra makes it worse, so if this continues I'll probably go bra-less for the rest of my treatments. With 6 more to go, I'm at the home stretch, and knocking on wood that I get through them with no significant SEs. This weekend has put me in the Christmas spirit finally! My niece was in our city's Nutcracker production. She had 2 roles and was amazing in both! And I'm not saying this because I'm her aunt. LOL Then yesterday, our choir had our Christmas concert, and just seeing the audience's faces light up made my day. Afterwards, my hubby and I had a lovely dinner with a fellow choir member and her husband. The restaurant had a gas fireplace and was decked out with lights and trees, creating a great ambiance. We were seated near a family celebrating an 80th birthday. Seeing the 3 generations all together was a great reminder of what the holidays are all about... celebrating with loved ones! Have a great week, ladies! ",

Prior to dx, I was doing a fitness bootcamp which focuses on strength and resistance training. So for me, I had to stop my workouts since I had a mastectomy. I also have to be careful because of lymphedema since I had lymph nodes removed. I started the LiveStrong program through my local YMCA during chemo and we have personal trainers versed in cancer care so you may want to look into that. My treatments were 3 weeks apart so I was able to get workouts in on my good days. I know of someone in my surgery group on here (see May 2017 surgery) that was doing water aerobics, so swimming should be fine for you. Check what your MO recommends. I think most MOs will recommend some kind of activity durong treatments, both chemo & radiation. Hope this helps! JenRuns, I'm so glad to hear that your exchange surgery went well! And yay to no drains!! I have to wait at least 6 months to a year before I can do this. My PS is very conscientious about post-treatment issues so she prefers to wait until after all my treatment is done. Emily, make sure to ask your RO and nurses what they recommend for lotions. Some ROs like mine only wanted to stick to one remedy at a time. If my skin had a reaction, then he would make adjustments. I was actually given a sample of calendula cream that lasted me a few weeks. Runnermum, happy belated birthday! You deserve to be spoiled! It's a good thing your birthday is far enough away to be combined with Christmas. Hahaha My brother's is on the 27th but we have been good about celebrating his day separately. Paulette, I start tamoxifen sometime after the new year. I'm starting to feel more pain under my armpit and the edge of my breast where the rads was targeted. I feel it mostly when I move my arm and the skin stretches. But I am persisting with the manual lymph drain massage and stretching daily. How's your LE during rads? ",

Yesterday I went to buy Claritin to accompany Neulasta and Senokote in anticipation of constipation. The anti-nausea meds are all the prescribed ones but I went and stocked up on ginger candy & ginger tea just in case. Also... I just finished making Rebecca Katz's infamous Magic Mineral Broth! Will be freezing several batches for next weekend. If you haven't heard about this, it's supposed to provide tons of nutrients especially if you don't have the appetite for anything else. I purchased a recipe book called \"The Anti-Cancer Kitchen\" and this is the go-to recipe. I just realized a few days ago that she posted the recipe on her website: http://www.rebeccakatz.com/magic-mineral-broth/ Her recipe is for 8 quarts, so I halved it because that seemed like a lot. It lacks protein so I may add some shredded chicken to one if the batches later. Now allow me to vent a little... Up to this point, my medical team has been on the ball from my Nurse Navigator to my surgeon and hospital staff. But I have had issues with the Oncology team with scheduling... My MO was awesome when I first met with him and we set up our next meeting, no problem. But when I was contacted to schedule my chemo 101 and infusions, the timing got messed up somehow. I didn't know my MO works out of 2 offices that are 30 min apart so I guess I can see how the scheduling can get confusing. But they really dropped the ball on my port placement. I had mentioned (to my MO) that I wanted to get a port due to my small veins at our FIRST meeting and he said he would refer me back to my BS, whom I really liked. So I waited for a call to schedule the surgery and nothing. I sent a message to my MO during the week of 4th of July regarding the scheduling mix-ups and when I should get the port surgery. The schedule finally got figured out but again I never heard about the port surgery. So I figured like some of you, I would get it done the day of my infusion. Last Thursday, when I meet the Oncology nurse for the chemo 101 session she aaked if I had a port. I said no, and that I hadn't heard anything from my MO's office. She took a look at my arm and noticed my lack of veins and she said I NEED to have a port in place and she would send a message to my MO. So on Friday I finally got a call from someone to schedule the port placement. The only date I could do it was Wed (chemo is on Thurs) and she shot me down and said it had to be done earlier to allow for the skin to heal. Ugh! So I scheduled it for Tuesday. Then I find out I need to reserve 4 hours for a surgery that will only last an hour if that. What?! So I guess this is going to be done under GA... Double UGH! On Friday night, I went online to see the details of my appt. It turns out that she double-booked me on Tuesday. I'm supposed to meet with my MO at the same time. Now how do you not see the conflict on my schedule? I know they can see all my appointments and see where there is a conflict so I don't know why she didn't see it. So I sent out a frantic message to my MO and hopefully he can see me on Wed instead. So I have been trying not to let this stress me out, but I also had to make sure my husband can take the day off to take me for port surgery. Luckily, he was able to on such short notice. Ok... Rant over. :) Hope the ymmy soup has cooled down as I wrote this so I can pack it all up. Have a good night and a great week to come!",

She tried to time that particular SE from the time she hooked up the bag! Mari: thanks for the kind words! Remember I'm only in day 2 of my first cycle. I'm really dreading days 3-5 especially since day 6 is my birthday!! DH has something planned and he's not telling me. I just hope I'm well enough to celebrate... My only fear is going out with my immune system compromised. But I won't know my WBC count until right before cycle 2. Welcome LoJo100! Looks like we're doin the same chemo regimen. Are you doing 4 cycles or more? I thought about doing the cold capping but it would be too much for my DH to help with. I hope to be getting back to a regular walking regimen soon. Ever since surgery, I've been taking walks here and there and doing my physical therapy but I know I need to get out there more. I made it a goal to get a walk in this morning before my Neulasta shot. I was thinking that I might have so much joint & bone pain afterwards that I needed to get them moving now. So this morning, I went to my local church. Our Catholic church has a huge shrine with a statue of Mary at the top, and a cement path that goes maybe 50 yards in circumference. there were a few people walking laps around it while praying. I have heard meditation is great for recovery so I decided to try it and managed a 30 minute walk with a few pauses throughout. This was huge for me! I don't know why I never thought of doing this before. Today is day 2 after the 1st cycle so I'll try and get out there again this weekend while the SE are still manageable. Looking forward to your future updates, LoJo! Paulettek: So glad to hear your infusion went well today and that you were able to get a walk in also! Do you get the Neulasta shot tomorrow? Or do you have the injector to do it yourself? Hope the rest of the weekend has minimal SEs for you! I was doing fine after Neulasta shot today for a few hours. Right around dinnertime, I started feeling some soreness around my legs and ankles. I don't know if it's from the shot or from my walk this morning. I naturally have weak ankles since I've twisted and sprained them so many times in my younger days, so I'm just trying to be careful when I walk so I don't sprain them. I hate being in this hypervigilant mode because I'm always wary about every little thing. Like is the tingling in my feet from the chemo or have I just been sitting in the same position for too long? LOL I noticed that I had a slight cough throughout the day. Is that the chemo or my allergies acting up? I guess we'll have to play the watchful waiting game... Good night, all!",

I got a manicure a few days before chemo and my nails are pretty strong. But I'll probably start to use the Nail Envy next week. I got my hair cut a little shorter today (just a little trim) to anticipate the upcoming hair loss. I didn't want to do too much until after my sister's wedding which is right before my 2nd infusion. So hopefully I can retain most of my hair until then. I'm not sure if it was mentioned here by ine of our runners, or in another thread but someine recommended nuun tablets to add to water for flavor and electrolytes. I happened to find some when I was out shopping today. I got the strawberry lemonade flavor and I love it! So fizzy! 😝",

My bone pain in my legs has minimized some, but feeling some aches in my lower back and hips, so I have to get up & move every so often. I work a desk job so it's easy to get stuck in one position for so long. Because the bone pain is less, I didn't take Claritin and so far so good. Hubby made plans for tonight, but had to postpone since he ended up in the hospital last night after feeling chest pains. He's ok now, just needs to take it easy at work. So it'll just be cake with my hubby, parents & siblings tonight. I'm so blessed to have family living close by. I find myself being paranoid about SEs during this first week. I felt a tingling in my scalp and nail beds earlier, my nose is starting to run, and there's some rawness on my tongue... most likely from all the tea and ginger lozenges I've been sucking on. I guess its just a matter of balance, and hope I don't get to be at hypochondriac level. 😜",

I tend to pull any loose hair out before I shower so that I don't have a bunch falling out when I shampoo. But this morning, I pulled A LOT MORE than normal. So I was scared to shampoo. I used dry shampoo instead but I don't know which is worse. My hair is a short bob, so I'm hoping what remains will stay until after my sister's wedding this weekend. Will definitely start wig shopping today at a local shop. I've been having headaches more often, but not the scalp pain that others have described so I didn't think it would be falling out yet... At least not until my 2nd infusion next week. Re: weight loss, I haven't had any problems eating, no nausea/vomiting, no extra exercise, and yet my weight has been steadily decreasing. So far, I have lost 5 lbs since my first infusion. I have been eating more vegetables and less carbs so hopefully that's why. As someone who struggles with mild obesity I should be ecstatic! But the nurse that did my chemo training said that they monitor chemo patients' weight each time to make sure they're not losing too much. Hopefully 5 lbs and counting won't be too much.",

Hope everything went well, and that the post-infusion side effects will be minimal so you could enjoy the time with your friends and family next week! Prayers... Teese, Enjoy your time away from home (and cancer stuff) with your family! I know this is our chemo thread, but I hope you don't mind me sharing bits about rads... I will have my 3rd rads today and a little scared. Yesterday, I had some mapping done with the bolus and was lying on the rads table for 20 min or so while they took the images. Then treatment started, where 3 areas are radiated, and the whole thing lasts less than 10 minutes. About halfway through, I got vertigo. I had closed my eyes to avoid the lights and I started to feel spinning. I get vertigo every now and then, and it's been about a year since I had an episode. I almost panicked and wanted to yell out for them to stop so I could sit up. But instead I opened my eyes and fixated my eyes on one of the tree branches on the ceiling. (There's a neat photo of a tree on the ceiling that's illuminated, so you have something to stare at when you're flat on your back) I stared at that branch and prayed for the spinning to go away, and after a few seconds, it did. I didn't have any other episodes for the rest of the day. But I had another episode this morning. I went to the bathroom after I woke up, and as soon as I sat on the toilet, the spinning started. Again, it lasted a few seconds but I freaked out because I was thinking it might happen again at rads. So on my way to work, I picked up dramamine. I'm praying that this helps and that I don't have an episode this afternoon. ",

It turned out one of the panels on the edge of the machine decided to come loose and fell off. Crazy! I started noticing my skin peeling near my collarbone and cleavage areas. I've been putting the aloe on the breast area and armpit only. When I met with the RO earlier this week, he mentioned that I should also apply the aloe right under my collarbone up to my shoulder since rads hit that area also. When I noticed the peeling, I realized those were the areas I had not put aloe on from the beginning of my treatment. He also told me that I didn't need to apply the aloe to my armpit since that area isn't being treated since lymph nodes were removed. Doh! I had read other people's posts saying the armpit was affected throughout the treatment, so naturally I applied aloe there to avoid any adverse reactions. Regardless, I'll probably continue applying it in the general armpit area because it cools the area and feels good. 😛 What's everyone doing for Thanksgiving? I'll be spending it at my parents' house with my siblings and their families. We're all local so we don't have to travel too far.

The only thing my RO wanted me to use on my skin was aloe, and then they monitored my condition each day. My skin started to get dry a couple of weeks ago, and they gave me calendula cream last week. So I haven't tried anything else. I met with my RO today, and he said it may get worse the next 2 weeks after I'm done which sounds like the skin reacting to the radiation burn, so I should expect a layer of my skin to peel. It sounds like a reaction i get to sunburn. So I will keep up this regimen into the new year when I see my RO a month after rads is done. I don't use a pump, but I was told to keep up the manual lymph massage and was given arm exercises to do daily. For my hair, I have been using Nioxin since I started losing my hair during chemo. I was hoping it would keep my longer strands intact but I ended up shaving anyway during chemo. I don't know if it has helped my hair growth, so when I run out I probably won't buy another bottle unless I notice a slowdown in growth. My hair seems to be growing faster now, but it's growing at different lengths. I'm tempted to shave it all to the same length so that it grows more evenly but I'm afraid that will slow it down.",

My skin is still intact but is pink in some areas and dark in others. I feel some tenderness in my armpit area and the left side of my chest. (I'm only doing my left side). My expander feels tight and my RO said it was due to inflammation from rads happening under my skin. I just do chest stretches throughout the day to alleviate the tightness. No other swelling in other areas. My hair growth is crazy right now. Soon I'll need to get my eyebrows waxed to clean up the stray hairs. My armpit hairs are also back. Since I have lymphedema I'm really afraid to shave there. Does anyone have recommendations on an electric or battery-operated shaver? Paulette, my PT didn't want to see me until a couple of weeks after rads, since the swelling from rads may take a while to settle. But if I did have a significant change in fluid retention during rads she wanted me to see her. Your MO should be able to advise you as well. Proud, what a crazy schedule for your meds.

I was there in January several years ago for my hubby's 40th birthday, and despite the cold weather we had a blast! Proud, hope you feel better soon!

Time has flown by... Now that you're seeing hair growth, it will start to grow faster. One day you will wake up and be surprised at how much has grown. Re: neuropathy, I still feel a little on the balls of my feet and toes, but I only notice when I've been on my feet all day. I met with my MO last week and he started me on tamoxifen. So far, no major SEs. Since I've \"done so well with my treatments\" (his words), I just need to see my gyno regularly and keep up with my regular screenings. I'll see him in 6 weeks, then quarterly going forward unless I have any major issues. I meet with my RO next week for my 4 week post-rads follow up. Since I don't have any skin issues currently, this should be a short appointment. I requested a referral to an Oncology nutritionist, so I have an appointment next week. Since my appointments seem to be wrapping up this month, I have to figure out what my new normal will be. Other than diet and exercise, I need to watch out for activities that affect lymphedema. My LE is keeping me from doing any heavy lifting but PT was ok with light weights. I bought some resistance bands a few months ago so I guess I should start using them. Last week, my friends came by with their 9-month old baby and I awkwardly tried to carry him on my non-affected side but that was weird, so I stood him up and held his hands as we went for a little waddle around the office.

So I'm just realizing the Zofran was most likely causing my constipation. Well, I didn't take Zofran today and yup! had a normal bowel movement. Go figure! Hahaha. Instead of Zofran I took the Compazine for nausea, which I did twice today. Does anyone have any remedies for bone pain? Clariitin is a once-a-day pill so I don't want to take more. But what else is there? I'm also taking ES Tylenol. I was advised not to take NSAIDS like Advil.",

Hopefully I can sleep better tonight. I realized that everything is bland-tasting to me now. So dinner was chicken & ginger soup. I'm glad the nausea went away at least for today. Leatherette: hahaha that is exactly how I felt after my first cycle! I wanted to get everything done that day. The steroids made me feel bloated and I mostly drank fluids that day.

My MO also told me to use Ativan to counteract the steroid so I stopped Ativan when I stopped the steroid. Since I was still having bone & joint pain the Tylenol PM minimized the pain as well.

I was hoping they would give us the OPI Nail Envy that others have been using to help with nail issues. But they just gave us an OPI brand neutral nail polish. Also, this session didn't include a free wig, but we were able to go through the wig bank afterwards and pick something out. I didn't get one since I already got a few from the other cancer center last week.

I had my 2nd taxotwre infusion last week and had a couple of \"new\" side effects that came up. I may have had the onset of thrush. My tongue was white and my mouth was dry for about 3 days. I had stopped the Biotene a week before my 2nd infusion since I didn't have any incidents of mouth sores. I started Biotene back on the day before my 2nd infusion but I probably should not have stopped. It did go away eventually. But I'm not stopping Biotene this time. Another SE I got this 2nd round was in the genital area. I had a large pimple that hurt like crazy especially when my underwear would rub against it. I was not about to go commando so I just moved slow. LOL. I haven't seen anyone else post about this so I didn't think it was chemo-related. Then I remembered getting it after my 1st infusion. At the time I thought it was due to having my period, and was irritation from tampons and/or maxi pads. I did a bit of searching in past threads and did see a few discussions about this SE so I guess it happens but it's not common. I'm also having some pain starting in my fingers when I type. I'm not sure if its from having short nails, or neuropathy is starting. I normally get manicures, but decided to cut my own nails this time and I cut them shorter than I'm used to. I didn't ice during past treatments since space at my infusion center is pretty tight, and knowing my clumsy self I would probably spill the ice (or whatever melts) all over the floor and cause someone to trip and fall... If it gets worse, I'll try to ice at the next cycle. Hopefully it's not too late then.",

She gave cephalexin/Kerflex as an antibiotic, plus a topical ointment to kill the infection. But she is so anti-infection that she is thinking of removing the expander altogether. And since you can't do chemo while you are recovering from surgery, I will have to wait at least 4 weeks to resume chemo.

It hasn't gotten worse with each treatment, but I do feel it more after I do a lot of walking. I will probably try the L-glutamine that everyone swears by.  I had a horrible weekend of swollen hands and hives! I'm wondering if it was from my chocolate-covered cherries binge on Friday night. Haha I started feeling my hands swelling on Saturday morning. By the afternoon my hands were itching and the back of my head and ears were also itchy and starting to swell. I tried Benadryl and cortisone for the itching. The swelling in my hands got worse on Sunday so bad that I couldn't type on my phone, and hives started on my belly so I went to urgent care. The doc prescribed hydroxyzine for itching which helped somewhat, but my hands are still swollen. This all started on day 11 after infusion #3 of TC. I updated my MO's office this morning, and I just got a message from my MO that he doesn't think it's chemo related. I hope not, and that it goes away soon. I have my final infusion next week and hope nothing bars me from finishing this. I've gone back and read Lojo's experience with her hives, and I think we were originally on the same regimen. Hopefully this doesn't last, and that I'm able to get through my \"good\" week pain-free.",

So the hives on my belly are mostly gone, but my hands are still a little swollen. I contacted my primary care doctor to see if I can see her today, but she's busy so I left a message with my symptoms and just waiting to hear back from her. My MO's office (nurse) also called to see how I was feeling and I explained that the hives relocated to my legs and hands were still swollen. She will check again with my MO to make sure it isn't chemo related. I usually get a flu shot in Oct/Nov, when I have my annual checkup, but will see if I can get it sooner. My clinic has been offering flu shots for the last 3 weeks, so hopefully my MO will okay it while they still have a supply of vaccines.",

My PS didn't give me much detail at first so when I asked about it, she convinced me to consider D flap as a last resort in case there are problems with the implants. That made sense to me, since I know someone that tried implants but her body rejected it, so she ended up doing D-flap. If there were problems with the d-flap, there may not be another option. At least that's what I was led to believe. If my PS was more encouraging about it, I would totally consider it also. For those on Ativan, my oncology & infusion nurses both said it was not habit-forming. I only took it to counteract the steroid, so I was only using it for Days 1-3 and only before bed. But I don't know if it did anything other than make me drowsy. I still would wake up in the middle of the night and couldn't go back to sleep right away. I hated taking all these pills, but it would only be for the first few days and I guess it helped manage the side effects. I also get heartburn before going to bed and just take Tums. Also, ginger lozenges helped me with any feelings of indigestion. I took Benadryl last night for allergies and it knocked me out, and I actually ended up sleeping in this morning. i just can't take it often because of my hypertension.",

It was so much fun and so heartwarming to have friends & family joining/supporting me. But I think the walk took its toll on me. I was tired the following day, then got a sore throat on Monday and still battling this cold. The upside to all this? I get to wear scarves again! And I don't mean on my head... hahaha Fall has finally arrived to Northern Cali! I will be 4 weeks PFC tomorrow, and still have many of the same side effects: Neuropathy: I still have soreness in my toes and balls of my feet, and sometimes tingling when I'm on my feet for a long time. My nails are still purple, but I think it's growing out. And I have indentations as my nails are growing out, but no lifting or cracking. I have been using Nail Envy since I started chemo but usually changed the polish every 2 weeks. I was spoiled getting a gel manicure every couple of weeks pre-diagnosis since I'm so bad at doing my own nails. I get polish at the edge of my fingers, and my nails would always get smudged because I'm impatient waiting for it to dry... But I have to say I am getting better at this! LOL I'll keep using Nail envy until my nails are back to normal. My cuticles used to be so dry but in the last week they aren't as dry, and I don't need to moisturize as often. Eyesight: My eyesight has always been bad, but I did notice it got worse during chemo. I didn't think it was related, until you all mentioned it. I wear contacts for astigmatism, and notice that my near vision is really bad. I have a pair of drugstore reading glasses and I find myself using them more often. This is usually the time of year I see my optometrist, so I'll be scheduling an appointment towards the end of the month to give my eyes time to get adjusted. Taste: My taste buds are slowly coming back. What I'm worried about is my lack of taste for salty things. I have high blood pressure, so I really need to watch my salt intake. It's just tough when I eat out or eat someone else's cooking and I can't tell if it's salty or not. I have been noticing that my ankles swell at the end of the day, so I think it's due to water retention and having too much salt plays into this. Putting my feet up helps. In other news, I got my radiation simulation done a couple of days ago, and I start rads next week. My experience was similar to yours, Teese. Did you also have to do a breathing simulation? My technician guided me to take a breath to raise my chest, and hold it for about 10 seconds. This was hard for me, since I'm so used to diaphragm breathing. I sing in choirs and chest breathing is a no-no. I was told that since they are radiating my left side, where my heart is, the machine will use my breathing as a guide when radiating the area near my heart. Leatherette, that really sucks that HR is giving you the run around. Have you used up your FMLA? Sorry for the long-ish post, but since I don't get on here as often I'm updating as much as I can when I can. Cheers!  ",

I can't wait to be in your shoes! I think during my last thread on here, I mentioned my DH had planned a trip to celebrate the end of chemo and our belated anniversary. We ended up going to Seattle! The week leading up to the trip was pretty crappy: I had a sore throat and cough all week, then got hives a few days before. Luckily the hives were only on my left thigh and didn't spread. On the day of the trip, we started with a 4 hour flight delay on Friday, and ended up with a cancelled flight on Sunday - all weather-related. Apparently, it's rare that snow hits Seattle, and it happened to be last weekend. Despite the miserable weather, we did manage to have some fun around downtown and the waterfront, and eat some good seafood. I also loved seeing the trees with the beautiful fall colors, since it's rare here in the SF Bay Area. We decided not to rent a car, so we walked and uber'd everywhere. We did a lot of walking, so I hope that made up for all the walking I missed out on during chemo. LOL I also started rads this week. I did the simulation last week, and was supposed to start treatment on Tuesday, But when I arrived I was told they would be taking photos and taking measurements. So they added an additional treatment day to my schedule. Boo! The actual treatment took longer than the 5 minutes they said it would be because they still had to reposition me and make more markings before the actual treatment. I hope it goes quicker the next time. Since they are treating my left side and avoiding the heart, I have to take deep breaths to expand my chest when they tell me to and hold for a few seconds. When you're lying down it's hard to breathe from the chest since you automatically breathe through your diaphragm. I have a really hard time with this and they have to keep reminding me to raise my chest. So I end up taking a huge amount of breath in because somehow I still breathe through my stomach, and it feels awkward. I think I need to practice this before sleeping. Since my clinic only has one rads machine, the scheduling is pretty tight. My rads schedule coincides with the LiveStrong fitness program so I had to discontinue it (LiveStrong, not rads LOL). At least I get to keep the temporary YMCA membership until the program officially ends, so now I just have to motivate myself to go...",

I was advised to use 98% or higher pure aloe until they tell me otherwise.

I think it's a combination of the techs moving me back and forth, and the fact that the table is so narrow. At first I was afraid that I might fall off when they move it back and forth. But the anxiety is getting better each day. I just try and think happy thoughts when I'm lying there. The music that is streaming into the room also helps. Yesterday was Josh Groban whom I love!! Today was some mellow folk music, which I was not a fan of. Some of the lyrics were depressing... LOL My skin has not changed much. Even the peeling I experienced last week has resolved itself. It must be the aloe vera gel doing it's job.. I apply the aloe 3 times a day: in the morning after I shower, in the afternoon after rads, and in the evening before I go to bed. I haven't experienced any dryness, so I haven't applied any moisturizer. I have been using Eucerin as my daily moisturizer for the rest of my body, so I'll continue using it on radiated areas since everyone here seems to like it. As far as the fatigue, I noticed that I get sleepy earlier than my normal sleep time. And I have been sleeping through the night. Runnermum, I always thought rads had to be done at the same time every day, and if I couldn't make it on a particular day they would just add an extra day at the end. I'm glad that I can reschedule if there's a spot available. I don't want to add days and extend it longer than I have to. Seeing your activity reminds me that I need to do more. My rads schedule has interfered with my gym schedule, but I really need to get back into it. My RO strongly advised me to get at least 20 minutes of activity each day... it can be as simple as running around with the kids or gardening. Since I have no kids or a garden to tend to, I guess that means I have to increase my daily steps or make time for the gym. Teese, colds are a bummer. I still have a lingering cough from a cold I had 3 weeks ago! I hope you are well enough to enjoy the Thanksgiving holidays. Paulettek, glad to hear the chemo SE are getting resolved as time goes by. I don't get as many hot flashes now, but I was getting it at night also for several weeks. The neuropathy in my fingers is pretty much gone, but still have it in my toes. Does anyone have a good recipe for sauteed or pan-fried brussel sprouts? Since the turkey will occupy the oven, I will have to prepare them on the stove.",

I helped my parents put up their tree but I feel like I'm just going thru the motions. I haven't gotten much shopping done either but I'll probably do most online and/or go the gift card route. I will be doing Christmas-y stuff this weekend so hopefully that will change my mood. I will be watching my niece perform in the Nutcracker for her first time.

I'm probably a couple of weeks behind you PFC, and my hair has been growing quicker but not as full as yours yet. Have you gotten the sides trimmed? I feel like I need to get my sideburns trimmed since they are out of control, and the grayest part of my hair growth so far. I am covering the gray sideburns with waterproof mascara for now since they're not covered by my wig. LOL I also have a patch of gray near my right temple, which is consistent with pre-chemo hair. I'm about 3 weeks post-rads and my skin has been healing well. I still get occasional twinges in the back of my arm. During the first 2 weeks after my last session my skin did get worse. My skin turned red, then dark, then it started sloughing off. I freaked out when this started happening because I thought my skin was cracking and waited for it to start oozing. It never did and that's when I realized it was patches of fresh new skin underneath the burnt skin. Most of My skin is back to the normal color, but still darker in the axilla area where the bolus was. Paulette, hang in there... I noticed some swelling during rads from my forearm to my elbow. I would do MLD massage most nights but was instructed not to massage any radiated areas if it was too sensitive. When I met with my PT last week she measured my arm and there was a difference of 0 - 1.5 cm. So wearing the compression sleeve during rads definitely helped! If you aren't using a sleeve maybe check if your PT or RO will allow it. Yay Teese, you're almost done with rads! Hope the healing SEs are minimal for you. Your hair should start coming in quicker now. I felt like mine grew faster once I was done with rads. I met with my MO today and since I wasn't having any issues with SEs, he started me on tamoxifen. The pamphlet that came with the bottle noted that common side effects are hot flashes, nausea, vomiting, weight gain/loss, fatigue, bone pain, dizziness... Boy, those sure sound familiar!! I stared at the bottle for a long time, feeling really anxious about the SEs. I sure hope it's easier than chemo! ",

My potassium levels sometimes go below normal so I boost it up with coconut.

I've also been dealing with massive bone aches in my legs mostly, but hasn't debilitated me yet so I just keep on moving while I can. Do you have to get Neulasta also? I think Claritin is helping. For constipation I've taken Senokote once a day, and drinking tea and water throughout the day. I have had little success with bowel movements but not at my normal so has me a little worried.

Hopefully that will move things along. I am so motivated by everyone here, esecially by you runners. I was supposed to attempt a 5k run in June but with surgery I had to give that up. I am not a runner at all, but did a couple of 5K's a few years ago and wanted this year to be the year that I get out there again.

Haha These are the areas I wasn't applying aloe to from day 1, so maybe that's why it's starting. I wasn't told exactly where to apply the aloe, so I just assumed my foob and armpit area since I've read stories of irritation in those areas the most. Even though I knew they were radiating thenlymph nodes near my collarbone, it didn't dawn on me to apply aloe in that area. Duh! My rads center is only closed on Thursday so I'm able to get my dose on black Friday. I'm not a black Friday shopper anyway, so it works fine for me... Hope you all have a restful weekend before the holidays begin next week!",

I know technology is sophisticated nowadays, but it doesn't hurt to ask. Especially if they are radiating your left breast, you want to make sure that care is taken around your heart. Good luck today! It should be uneventful compared to chemo... :) ",

Since it's hard to find now that summer is over, our clinic's pharmacy stocks it. Even my local Whole Foods did not have pure aloe vera. They didn't want me to go buying all these creams that I may not need, so they have sample sizes of creams that they would give me if I have skin issues. I just had rads #9 and my skin is holding up fine... So just go with your RO's recommendations. OCDAmy, I use Native deodorant also. I like it better than Tom's. The only issue I have with Native is that the fragrance (lavender) has lessened. I'm about 3/4 of the way through and the scent is very faint. I don't mind it, but I like to catch a whiff of the scent throughout the day. :P ",

Congrats to those that have finished. Please continue to keep us posted in your post-rads experience. For those experiencing SEs, hang in there and trust your medical team. My team has been pretty wonderful. I do have a couple of rads techs that have type A personalities so when they're together I feel the tension. But I know they try to be civil in front of the patient. I'm glad my techs are on rotation so I don't get these two together very often. I finished 22 of 28 yesterday. And I still get a little anxious when I'm on that table. The ceiling art with the blue sky & trees, as well as the music streaming into the room, gives me some comfort. I met with my RO this week and he gave me calendula cream to add to my arsenal. I've been using aloe vera 3 times a day up to this point and have not had any skin iasues. My armpit is darker and my breast is a little pink arouns the edges. So hopefully this continues to go as well as it has. I am anticipating some skin irritation closer to the end and the weeks that follow. So we'll see... Have a great weekend, everyone!",

I had my simulation last week and wasn't given any prep instructions. The tech told me that the nurse would give me additional information at my first session. I guess I was expecting to get an informational handout that lists side effects and/or what to do for relief, etc. like I've gotten for every other treatment after diagnosis. My RO said that I can use pure aloe vera (at least 98% or higher). I've also been getting over a cold the last week so haven't made it to the drugstore. I am most worried about lymphedema. I have a bit of swelling from my left hand to my forearm and use a compression sleeve and glove daily. My RO said that a SE of rads is swelling so I'm hoping my LE doesn't get worse. I was lurking in the Oct. thread but don't recall reading about anyone's issues with LE. ",

Even Whole Foods didn't have what I needed... My local drugstores have their own version of aloe vera, but I was instructed to get 98% or higher \"pure\" aloe vera. ,I found one at Sprouts, which is a grocery store selling natural foods and has a health & beauty section. I would like to find a travel size to carry around with me. I just finished rads #10, and I think the aloe is helping because I don't have any pink areas or warm areas either. I had a little peeling a few days ago, but it has subsided. One SE that just started noticing is a pinching feeling under my armpit. It's like a light twinge that comes and goes. I meet with my RO tomorrow so I'll ask him about it. Ellyn27, I think the meeting with the nurses is to get your scheduling set up, and to go over any do's and don'ts during the treatment. At least that's what my meeting with the nurse was about...",
