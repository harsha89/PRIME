I got both an ultrasound done and I just got a mammogram done and she referred me to a surgeon. The ultrasound came back saying there was no mass or cyst. The surgeon said that all he could feel was fatty tissue but wanted to be sure so sent me for a mammogram. I just got it done today and the lady in there showed me the mammogram and nothing was visible. I have to wait 2 weeks to see the surgeon and what he thinks about the ultrasound and mammogram results. I can't expresses how worried I am! I am only 18. Can someone please give me there opinion on this? Log in to post a reply",
