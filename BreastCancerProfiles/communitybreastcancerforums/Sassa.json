My left breast received a BIRADS 5 rating in a mammogram six months after the right breast was diagnosed.  I went right in for a simple mastectomy as I wanted the left breast gone because of gross body asymmetry causing neck, back and shoulder pain.  Everything in the left breast was benign. ",

I can't offer any advice on what you may have to undergo if you do have cancer until you are diagnosed. However, your inability to lose weight , diabetes, and PCOS does sound very familiar. Starting in my forties, my weight just spiraled upward no matter how much I dieted or exercised. My blood glucose levels were creeping up and diabetes was a when, not an if. Cholesterol levels were very high and statins and diet did very little to lower it. I am willing to bet that, like me, you have high blood pressure, never really slept through the night and that you crave carbs like a drug addict craves their drug of choice. If you are diagnosed with breast cancer, I wouldn't be surprised if it is hormone negative. Now for the good news, about nine years ago I learned about metabolic syndrome (and you are a poster child for it) and about the benefit of carb controlled diets. My guru has turned out to be a registered dietitian named Diane Kress and her version of a carb controlled diet she calls the \"Metabolism Miracle.\" She has worked with diabetics for years and developed her diet plan based upon the needs of her patients. Please google her and her diet plan. I can tell you that following her system I have lost over 100 lbs; my cholesterol levels are well within normal range without a statin; my blood pressure is controlled with one very low dose of drug; I sleep through the night and that I can easily pass up bread, pasta, and ice cream. Best of all, my mood (alright, I was downright cranky) has changed for the better. As I found out too late, having metabolic syndrome raised my risk of developing breast cancer and having it be hormone negative (on the other hand, there are no pesky side effects from hormone inhibitors as the drugs have no benefit for hormone negative breast cancer). Hoping for the best for you.  ",

The other issue is just the effects of the mastectomy.

I went without prostheses 99% of the time for two years and finally decided to go for reconstruction with tissue expanders and silicone implants.  I decided on reconstruction as I realized buying clothes when flat chested was as much a problem as when being over endowed. I had absolutely no problems with the whole reconstruction process and am now very happy with B cup sized breasts.  I don't have to wear a bra and have no discomfort from the implants. I consider my quality of life with the implants as superior in every way over life with the original equipment.  My one regret is that I had to have breast cancer to achieve my current status. ",

Several things you may wish to do: Start drinking water (or other fluid, no alcohol) 1 -2 days before your appointment.  You need to be well hydrated to pass the drugs through your system ASAP.  I was encouraged to bring bottles of water to drink during the drug infusion.  You will also need to stay well hydrated for several days after your appointment. Make sure you take your anti-nausea medication as directed.  You will probably need to take it for 3 -4 days after your chemo.  I found the anti nausea medications caused their own side effects (blurred vision, headache, and gave me the jitters). If your anti nausea medication doesn't seem to work (still feel nauseated or worse, throwing up), let your doctor know so the medication can be changed. Plan on eating bland food the day of and for several days afterwards.  Anything too spicy may make you feel ill. To save me from cooking, we stocked up on TV dinners.  My husband was happy eating his choice of frozen dinner and I could stick to the bland chicken and turkey ones.  Oatmeal was a good choice for breakfast. How many times do you need to go in for chemo?  I needed to go in 4 times, so after my first treatment I was 25% done.  After my second, I told myself I was 50% finished and on the downhill slope to the finish line.  Looking at the appointments in this way made me feel that I could do the chemo without a problem. Good luck - you can do it.",

As far as not appearing in public without forms, I started noticing that 98% of the people in public didn't even notice my chest area, and; that was a big (wonderful) change for me because my huge breasts always attracted unwanted attention.  The few that did notice seemed to be women who would stare at me in horror.  If I noticed, I would smile and say, \"Have you had a mammogram lately?\"  For the young well-endowed young ladies who were fashionably dressed with their chests hanging out (what happen to modesty?), I would look at them and say, \"In my day I could put your breast to shame.  Look really well, I am your possible future!.\" Robinlbe, Like you, I hated wearing bras before my mastectomies.  It was a huge disappointment to me to find out that BMX bras were even more ugly and uncomfortable than the iron maidens I used to wear before BC.  It didn't seem fair that I finally got rid of the beasts (not a misspelling!) and still had to wear ugly uncomfortable bras. What made me finally think about reconstruction was a cruise I took in October of 2008. I had decided I didn't want reconstruction.  I had some dresses that had lower necklines than I normally wore and needed some shape under them.  I invested in some protheses that were suppose allow me to stick them on my chest or attach them to my clothes (no bra straps to worry about). The prostheses just didn't work out that well and I realized that I was just too young at 58 to restrict myself to wearing Tee shirts or being totally frustrated by prostheses for the rest of my life.  After all, I had already spent my life since my teens dressing to fit my breasts, not for fashion.  That was when I seriously started to think about reconstruction. Best wishes for you all.  You will all eventually decide what you need or want.  There are pros and cons to both being flatchested or reconstructed.  Neither is all good or all bad However, your final right decision helps in the mental recovery from the BC journey..  ",

If your mother is currently in the trial but in a different arm where the investigational product is not given, she will not get permission to use the investigational drug while the trial is continuing. If she is not in the trial, but seeks to have the drug outside the clinical trial, the trial sponsor (drug company) will have to agree to allow her to have the drug and submit what amounts to a specialized, individual IND (Investigational New Drug) application as part of their approved IND.  The doctor will also have to agree to become a clinical investigator, obtain local IRB (Institutional Review Board) approval and do all the paperwork and documentation required for the individualized study. Many sponsors will not allow use outside the trial as at this point, the purpose is to obtain data in a controlled study with certain criteria.  The data from the \"compassionate\" use will still have to be collected and submitted as data in their IND, but can not be included as part of the cohort data.  It is burdensome and not usefull for drug approval. There may also be problems with the cost of the drug and who will carry the cost.  If the patient is expected to pay, their insurance company will probably refued to cover the costs as the drug is not approved for marketing. If you are asking about receiving the drug after the clinical trial is done and the \"NDA\" (New Drug Application) is submitted but not yet approved for drug marketing, there can be several scenarios.  The sponsor can ask that after a preliminary review by FDA, permission be given to use the drug in additional study subjects.  If that approval is given, only a set number of additional subjects can receive the drug and again, there will be criteria for its use. A subject previously in the trial but who didn't receive the drug, may be eligible for the dug at this point.  Data will still be collected and submitted as part of the NDA. The company may be allowed to charge for the drug at this point.  However, because the drug has not been approved for marketing, insurance comapanies may refused to pay for the drug. Of course, a sponsor may not ask that additional subjects be added after submission of the NDA. As you can see, obtaining an investigational product outside a clinical trial is not simple and  may noy be something that either your mother's doctor, the local institution, or the sponsor be willing to allow.",

Like you, I developed over sized breasts and I hated them.  Not for me the cute little tops, strapless gowns, anything with ruffles on the bustline.  My reality was clothes whose only criteria was that they fit and close over my bustline.  Bras were iron maidens that dug into my shoulders and the weigh of hauling the monsters around led to upper back, neck and shoulder pain and limited mobility in those areas. They hurt 28 out of 30 days a month and I couldn't stand to have them touched. I was blessed with a superior IQ, but was I ever known as the smart one?  No, I was described as the girl with the (hand gesture here with the hands held two feet away from the chest).  Just once, I wanted to have a conversation with either a male or female and not have the eyes stray to my chest and linger there. Finally, I couldn't deal with it all any more and decided to have a reduction.  First step, a mammogram earlier than my yearly one because a plastic surgeon wants to see one within the last month before doing a reduction.  Nothing obviously suspicious showed but I was told to come back in 6 months for a follow up.  Not going to happen so in I went for a biopsy.  The biopsy found a very small, aggressive tumor.  One week later I had the breast removed and cheered that it was gone. Now to get rid of the other beast (not a misspelling).  My PCP and oncologist both started documenting the pain I was in from the body asymmetry to convince the insurance company the the healthy breast should be removed.  Luckily, a mammogram 6 months later came back BIRADS 5.  In one week I had that one removed with no quibbles from the insurance company (pathology showed everything was benign in the breast). The day I came home from the second mastectomy, I  looked in the mirror at my flat chest and cheered:  THEY WERE GONE!!!!!!  I went gloriously flat chested for two years until I realized finding clothes for a flat chest was as difficult as finding them for a big one.  I checked into options for reconstruction and decided to do implants. Reconstruction was easy (TE's and exchange) and was done perfectly by my gifted plastic surgeon. I have beautiful, perky, B cup sized breasts that will never need a bra to hold them up.  They are pain free and I can finally wear all types of nice clothes. My foobs are superior in every way to the original equipment and they will never try to kill me.  If I had an offer of having my old breasts returned to me in a healthy state, I wouldn't accept the offer. My only regret is that I had to have breast cancer before the option of total removal was available to me. Why couldn't I just have this done in my twenties before the damage to my upper back, neck and shoulders occurred?",

I couldn't eat anything until about 1 PM or I would throw it back up. I couldn't concentrate on anything. You have a lot of company in your stress symptoms. By the way, the same thing happened to me. Eight years ago, I went in for a routine mammogram. It was classified BIRADS 3 (something there but probably benign). My primary care physician wasn't happy; she sent me right back in for a compression mammogram and an ultrasound. Both those came back with something there but probably benign. Again, my doctor wasn't happy and insisted I go in for a biopsy. I did and the rest is history. A small aggressive IDC was found. I am not saying this will be your outcome, but rather your doctor, just like mine was, is looking out for your best interests. Because my doctor wouldn't accept the BIRADs 3, my cancer was found very early and this was for the best. If no cancer had been found, I was spared the worry of waiting for the next mammogram and wondering if something was there. You will get an answer, and either way, the stress will either be gone or greatly reduced once you know what is in store for you.",

My PCP then told me to have a biopsy done as a  plastic surgeon would not touch me unless it was clear what was going on in my breast. I had an excisional biopsy (lumpectomy by any other name) because no specific lumps could be detected in the area in question. That lumpectomy found my IDC and I went on to have a mastectomy of my right breast. Six months after the first mammogram, I went back in for the follow up on my left breast. That mammogram came back as BIRADs 5 because of calcifications. I went straight to having a simple mastectomy because I wanted to be evened out.  After slicing and dicing the whole breast, nothing was found that was not typical benign changes of an aging breast. I guess the point of my story is BIRADS just serms to be a crap shoot based on what the radiologist thinks might or might not be there.",

I am extremely glad I did.  In the cluster of microcalcifications was found a small, extremely aggressive IDC. The KI -67 was 70%. If I had waited six months, I would have probably been stage 4 instead of 1.  The tumor was so fast growing that I was glad it was gone with the biopsy.

Best wishes to you.  Go talk to a PS about when might be the best time for reconstruction.  It might be alright to do now but better in the future. As someone currently doing reconstruction (2 years, 3 months out from chemo when expanders placed), I feel that a good reconstruction can't be rushed.  Because I was so far out from my mastectomies, I have had two years to gain back muscle flexibility in the chest, neck and shoulder areas through exercise and massage.  As a result, my PS said he was able to get excellent muscle coverage of the expanders (although he still did reinforce with alloderm) and can put in much more saline during fills without me feeling discomfort.    ",

His daughter was someone I knew and had played with in summer camp just 1 month before his announcement.  I was mortified at my laughter and burst into tears. Lucky for me, the teacher understood. When my daughter was in second grade, her teacher came to me about the monster that my daughter was.  This dimwit had been talking about Martin Luther King Day and had shown pictures from the sixties to second graders of bloody civil rights protesters, black school children with German Shepherds lunging at them as they tried to go to school and a lynched black man. In the stillness of the classroom, my daughter started laughing and the teacher was furious. My daughter had nightmares for a week after that classroom lesson. I gave the teacher a brief discourse on how the body reacts to stress and suggested that she be more age appropriate in her visual aids. Maybe the young man was just shocked at seeing you hairless and didn't mean to laugh.  Of course, having once laughed, he was probably embarrassed and hightailed it out of the room.",

It wasn't until my second mastectomy and I could go smaller in the prostheses sizes that I could wear the \"pretty\" bras. Blackcat, I certainly feel for you.  As mentioned above I was huge breasted (about your size) when I had my first mastecomy.  I got the largest prosthesis available and it didn't match my remaining breast.  It was, however, a compromise I took as to go larger would require a custom form.  I also couldn't have a silicone form as the weight was so heavy (silicone is heavier that breast tossue) that my already tortured shoulders couldn't deal with it. So there I was: a lifetime of dealing with ugly bras to support big breasts and trying to find clothes to fit over them to having to buy even uglier mastectomy bras with a prosthesis that didn't quite match the remaining side. That experience lead to my first meltdown of my BC experience out in the car.  I couldn't believe I finall got rid of one of the beasts (not a mispelling) to only have more difficulty in buying even uglier bras.",

Standing up, hold your arms down at your side with your lower arms extended in front of you at a 90 degree angle.  Press your shoulders backwards toward your shoulder blades.  Hold for a count of 5 seconds.  Repeat 15 times. Stand in a corner and place your forearms flat on both walls (left arm, left wall; right arm, right wall).  Lean in and hold for 20 seconds.  Repeat 3 times.  When you lean in, you should feel a pull across your chest.  If you don't, move back from the corner.  If I remember correctly, the ACS booklet has a similar exercise on a wall, not a corner.  The corner is more of a challenge. I find a hand towel the perfect length for the next exercise. Hold a towel diagonally across your back (like you are drying yourself).   One elbow should be  up in the air, the other arm is down and behind your back. With the arm with the elbow facing up, pull up on the towel which will pull your opposite shoulder and arm in towards your back and upwards.  Hold for 15 seconds.  Repeat 3 times. Switch arm positions and repeat. Extend your arms down and behind your back.  Hold a rod about 18 inches long in your hands (Palms up) behind your back.  Lift your arms upwards 15 times.  Holding a rod between your two hands causes less stress on the shoulders than clasping your hands behind your back  and lifting upwards. Standing up with your arms down at your sides, roll your shoulders back 20 times. I know there is an exercise in the ACS booklet that tells you to lie on your back with your arms at your side.  Hold onto and rod and lift up and over your head and touch the floor above your head.  I thought I had a full range of motion on this one until I tried to hold my arms over my head and touching the floor for a few seconds.  It has taken me several months, but I now can hold the extended position for two minutes.  I get too bored to try for a longer period.",

The four AC temporarily destroyed my cognitive ability.

I developed a language problem where I could think of a word, but wouldn't have the slightest idea of how to start spelling it. I also had problems trying to organize tasks. The language skills and ability to organize have come back. However, my math ability never really came back.

When we have chemo, a lot of the lashes and brows are affected and fall out.  They grow back in and because their growth patterns are not randomized like before chemo, you will have the lashes and brows grow back in, only to have thinning occurring again about three months later (normal hair loss time period). The hairs seem to randomize themselves again, but it will take several years before the periodic thinning stops being noticeable.  I think it was bout three years for me after AC.  I did have a year of hereptin after the AC and the herceptin also affects the hair growth, so the three years may be longer than someone not on herceotin.",

My daily exercise consists of alternating bike riding with strength building and flexibility (same day for these last two).  My strength building consists of working out with resistance tubing and weights.   I work on my overall body flexibility but do about 20 minutes dedicated to chest, shoulder, upper back and neck muscles. I have had a pain free experience (of course there was some pain with the initial TE placement because of the muscle manipulation involved) with the fills, exchange and implants.  My PS attributes my experience to the excellent condition of my skin (no rads, two year delayed reconstruction) and my physical condition, especially of the pec muscles.

If your Mom is lucky, the further follow up will turn out to be cysts or something else innocuous.  Even if she needs to go in for a biopsy, 80% of the lumps are benign.  The odds are in her favor that she is fine. Remember, most of us that may respond to your post have been diagnosed with breast cancer which mean we are in the 20% that finds cancer upon biopsy.",

I have been finding the research results that find having diabetes increases the risk of breast cancer and having hormone negative breast cancer as interesting. I am not diabetic (at least not yet, my doctor says my exercise and diet has probably kept it at bay), but I now feel my family history has played into my breast cancer. Interestingly enough, of my family of four, two sisters have diabetes; my brother is hypoglycemic; I have the hormone negative breast cancer.",

I am currently undergoing physical therapy to help my back, neck and shoulders issues from carting all that weight around upfront  and the further aggravation from the 7 months when I so asymmetrical.   ",
