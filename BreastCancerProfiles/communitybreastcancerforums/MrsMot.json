Maryann - Its scarey the first time around cos you don't know how you will react.  I start #2 today and I am not that nervous...just not looking forward to the down time.  I felt bad day 4 after chemo then weak day 5 & 6 and started bouncing back.  For the past 2 weeks I have felt my old self and great.  I hope that lasts for #2 and rest (I have to have 6 total treatments). There are so many great posts here that will help you. It helped me...however, Chickadee said it right,,,everyone is different.  Don't psych yourself out that you will have all the issue everyone has.  You might not!  Best of luck and hang in there...you can do this and you WILL survive!!! Going to #2 today.   I pray it goes well as I am prepared this time...I can't wait to be done with all this!  ",
