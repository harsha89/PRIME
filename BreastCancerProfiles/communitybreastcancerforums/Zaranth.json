It will also tell you what grade it is (meaning how fast it is growing), and it will indicate if it is positive or negative for estrogen/progestin receptors as well as whether is it positive/negative for HER2 (a protein). During a biopsy they will have to take samples of each tumor (if you have more than one like I did), but I had no lymph node involvement so I don't know if they will biopsy those at the same time or send you for a sentinel lymph node biopsy where they inject a dye that, during surgery, will show which lymph nodes are involved. The sentinel lymph node biopsy is done the day before you are scheduled for whatever surgery they decide you need (lumpectomy or mastectomy), and I found it quite painful. They inject the dye fairly close to the nipple, and it burns quite bad for a few seconds, then you wait for an hour, then they put you into the large circular scanner and you have to hold your arms over your head for about 25 minutes while the machine rotates around you and takes many images. The big benefit of this procedure is it is less invasive, and the surgeon will know exactly which nodes are involved so may actually remove less nodes in the end. I can't say how long it will take for you to get in for a biopsy etc. as I live in a different part of the world than you, but I can tell you that from when the mammogram found something suspicious I waited only a week for the ultrasound, another week for the biopsy, then I was in to see a surgeon in about a week and a half. I was in for a double mastectomy about a month and a half after it all started but that's because my surgeon is proactive about booking surgery times. He told me he books the times not knowing who will need them, but knowing someone will so I didn't have to wait long. I have talked to other women in different cities who had to wait several weeks for surgery and other tests so it will depend on availability where you are.",
