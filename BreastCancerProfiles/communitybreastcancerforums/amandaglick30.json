It turned out to be Fibroadenoma. So i was relieved. Since then i have noticed different lumps in my right breast. felt one that move around but i dont feel it anymore. now i have a hard bump in my breast. i do have some achiness and sometimes sharp pains in and around my breast. hugging my kids hurts at time. i mad another appointment for a mammogram.  am i being too paranoid? is this anything anyone else has gone thru? What was your outcome?    I also read that after having fibroadenoma, you can have a slightly higher risk of breast cancer.  I have three kids and i dont want to leave them. Log in to post a reply",
