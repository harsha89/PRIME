Unfortunately my weight goes up and down and I have a 10, 12, 14, and 16!! I travel a lot and snorkel so I get use out of them.Â  A question, last year I bought the Ameona, Aqua Wave, which is a very nice form, however, I have lost 22 pounds and now need a size 7. I can't afford another one. It looks like solid silicone. I am wondering if I can trim it? Anyone know? (any yes I plan to stay at this size once and for all!!!)",
