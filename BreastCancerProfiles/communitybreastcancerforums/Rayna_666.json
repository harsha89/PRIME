I think there is a lot of truth to it, however I couldn't in my mind justify risking just using that method. I was scared since I am only 33 and had triple negative idc (very aggressive and mine was in my lymph nodes already and insanely fast growing.) Maybe I would've been fine, but I decided to do the conventional approach and use alternative methods in conjunction. To me it made sense as I believe in science and spirituality. I eat almost entirely vegan, try to eat things that are mostly alkaline, meditate, practice qi gong, etc. Among other things. I think I did extremely well with chemotherapy (side effects were bearable and I had a pathological complete response even though I only had 4 of 12 rounds of Taxol.) I feel everyone should search their feelings and see what honestly feels right. I wish I could have refused conventional treatment and been someone who could say they beat cancer naturally, but this is what felt right for me.",

I showed a pathological complete response to chemo. However, since I had lymph node involvement before chemo, I am being recommended to have radiation therapy even though I had a bilateral mastectomy. I have done some research and I have found that there is a lot of controversy as to whether it is necessary in such a case. I can either refuse, get the treatment, or join a research study randomly assigning me radiation or no radiation to help determine the answer to this very question. I don't know what to do...

Yes, they actually want to radiate the lymph nodes and chest wall to make sure there aren't any cancer cells that were missed. I kept hearing horror stories about it messing up reconstruction too. My plastic surgeon doesn't seem phased by it though. He said he deals with it all the time and he will make it look great. I suppose that should be the least of my worries but I like to be informed on all aspects of what I am getting myself into! I feel like I would obviously not want to skip it when I actually needed it and have to start back at square one later on. The thing that would be difficult is I live 85 miles away and I would have to go 5 days a week in part of December and all of January. Where I live we get a lot of snow and the winter weather can be unpredictable. But like I said, if I do need it, I better get there... Thank you again for your replies. If anyone else has had experience in a similar situation, all input is appreciated.",

I am highly recommended to have radiation therapy to my chest wall and lymph nodes to be sure there are not cells hanging out that were missed. I don't want to refuse it and start back at square one at some point, but I don't want to go through it if its not necessary. I guess there is a controversy about weather it is needed in people with pathological complete response. Any suggestions?",
