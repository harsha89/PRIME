I chose to keep my left expander because I have to do radiation and my radiation oncologist said it would be better to leave it in so we can see how well the skin does. I really want implants, and have no desire to have any of the other forms of reconstruction, so it was a logical choice for me. I just did not want any more very invasive surgeries like the trams. Of course my left breast was healing and  doing great. If it had been red and hard like yours, I would have had it removed. I hope you do well with whatever you decide and I will say a prayer for you! Susan",

But like you said this is a graet place to vent and find encouagement. No matter how tired we are..we have to keep on keepin on. At least you can see some light at the end of the tunnel.

I have battled with low  rbc all the way through chemo. I had 2 blood transfusions during chemo and 1 in December. I went yesterday for my herceptin and the Onc said my hemoglobin is 10.2. That is up from what it was 3 weeks ago. At that time it was 8.9. So it looks like my body is trying to recover, which is good. The thing that concerns me is that my ferritin levels were very elevated. I believe the high end of normal is 160 and mine is 590. My AST liver enzymes were also very slightly elevated- 42..normal is 5-40. Does anyone know anything about this? Especially the high ferritin? I have googled it and it says it can be a sign of many things including cancer in the body. Of course that scared me to death. Could the blood transfusions be the culprit? From what I have read your body does not rid itself of excess iron (ferritin). I asked my Onc if the high levels could be bad and all I got was \"yes...we will have to watch it\" UUURRRR!!  Dx 5/2/2008, IDC, 2cm, Stage IIB, Grade 3, 2/7 nodes, ER+/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

I am 14 days into my rads and my fibro is acting up bad. My muscles in my chest and the muscles in my shoulder are twitching, tightening, and hurting very bad. I am afraid to continue with the rads because of what it is doing to my muscles. Is it temporary or permanent. I know rads changes tissues, so I am afraid it is just distroying my muscles. Anyone with fibro knows the pain we deal with this stuff!!. I know I need to be concerned about making sure the cancer doesn't come back and believe me I am. I am also concerned about the quality of life I will have after all this is done. Anyone out there that can help me? Unfortunatly my rads doc is out of town until Thursday, so the office just said to stay home until I can see her. Any info on this would sure be appreciated!!

I finally got to see my rads oncologist, but all he said was he doesn't know how the rads will affect my fibro long term, but you have to keep going. He did give me a presciption for some pain meds, although they don't seem to help much. Sister I am glad to hear you are starting to feel better. I took your advice and put myself back on my xanex today and it does seem to help. As I am sure you know well, rest is a big factor when it comes to fibro and that is something I have not had much of since I started rads. Just can't seem to sleep. They even gave me a prescription sleep aid, which does not putt to me sleep. What time I do sllep it is not restful. I am sure that is not helping my problems. Barb I am also sorry your questions did not get answered. If I would have seen it I would have. You are so right how noone understands the pain. I have had this since I was a little girl and had test after test run. Noone could figure out what was wrong and finally said it was all in my head. It wasn't until I was 30 yrs old that I was finally diagnosed. I got so tired of being told I was not really hurting. I KNEW how I felt..and it hurt! I did have a flare with my mastectomies and had a very long hard recovery. I was just starting to feel somewhat better when rads started and it started all over again. peeps congratulations on finishing those rads! I know you are excited! I wish you all the best of luck!

I did get aninfection in my right expander and have to go back in for surgery to have it removed, but even with that I think I still would be tired. Just be kind to yourself, and when you are tired and need a nap...take one. It is your body telling you it needs it so it can heal. I was told by my PS it would be months before I was really feeling good again. Like some of the other ladies said, we all heal at different rates.

I was reading over my path report and am not sure how to interpret it.I was told before surgery and chemo (I had neo-adjuvent) it was thought I had 2 positive lymph nodes. This is what my path report says after. Left breast tissue axillary sentinal node #1, CPS 1319, biopsy-one out of one lymph node positive for metastatic carcimoma(1.2 cm in size) Left breast, axillary contents, lymph node dissection-one out of seven nodes positive for metastatic carcinoma. My question is....did I have 1 or 2 positive lymph nodes? Is the sentinal node seperate from the lymph node dissection? I am confused. The crazy thing is I know my dr. told me, but for the life of me I can't remember what was said. If any of you can help it would be so appreciated!
