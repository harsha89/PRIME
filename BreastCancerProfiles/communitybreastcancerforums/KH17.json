Noting this is not the same as the digital mammogram that is used now for most routine screenings, rather often a 3D is what is what is used when there is a follow up. For post Dx patients, it was recommended to me as preferred routine screening going forward. MRIs are the thing I am most confused about. I am hearing different things about their benefit in routine post Dx screening. For the most, part my doctors are not recommending it as part of my routine screening going forward, rather they say it should only be used to clarify an issue surfaced by a mammogram. On the other hand, I know someone women who have been advised to alternate mammogram with MRI, and my RO thinks its useful in first few years. The primary concern seems to be false positives that may result in biopsies and added stress. I had this happen during the MRI that was required following my initial Dx so I can understand the concern, but I *thought* MRIs were better for dense breasts and finding DCIS. I've heard doctors say both \"yes\" and \"no\" to that! Frequency also seems to be an area of differing opinions. The impression I am getting is to a large degree it's a combination of personal and doctor preference. I am generally being told annual is sufficient, however when that clock starts has been all over the map from one year from last mammogram, to first one six months after surgery (or radiation, which was post surgery) and then annual from there? I can accept the rational that with my situation -- for those with more aggressive cancers it may be a different case -- that annual ensures that if anything comes back it will be found reasonably early again. Also, interested in how often and by whom clinical breast exams are being done for you as well. Pre Dx, mine were done annually by my GYN, who will presumably continue to do that -- but should one of my oncologists (MO? Surgeon?) also be doing that? I would love to know what others are hearing and doing especially regarding MRIs and whether doing more frequent than annual in first few years post Dx. Thank you!",

I think it was because I was just starting to feel like myself again and then there you are reminded you are still in it. I'm trying to focus on the fact of how lucky we are to live in a time with so much available to us. And, yet, of course it's still hard. Thanks for all the support & advice here.",

My surgeon said it was fine but the ROs seem to have less experience with it. To the extent there is a concern it seems to be with affect on the skin, not effectiveness of the treatment. Appreciate anyone's experience. Thanks",

I had bilateral repositioning/reduction done at the same time as my lumpectomy so I would not have to go back later, but as a result have more scar area. Since I think it's less common still to do combined surgery, as I did, it seems there is less experience with using these during radiation. No one has mentioned the protection strips you are using to me, just creams etc. Good luck with everything!",

I am in the US with a good PPO, and my insurance did cover but when I was checking the company did tell me there were options to bring down the cost if they didn't. My diagnosis was similar to yours -- *slightly* larger tumor, but Grade 1 -- and I was glad I did the test. Even though my surgeon and MO were fairly confident going in that I would not need chemo, having the added confirmation from the test was reassuring for me. As some have noted there is the \"risk\" that you might come back in a gray area and then face decision to do chemo or not. I think it comes down to knowing what kind of person/patient you are. For me, more info is preferred. Good luck with everything, and see if the company will offset any of your costs.",
