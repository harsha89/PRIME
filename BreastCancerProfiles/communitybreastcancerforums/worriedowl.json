      "Content": "worriedowl wrote: I noticed a small red spot on my breast this morning and didn't think anything of it. I thought I should do a search to see what it might be. Internet searches are never comforting. I'm only 19 but now I'm wondering about breast cancer. I'm trying not to freak out but I'm such a worry wart. I'm going to ask my mom about it in the morning and go from there but the whole IBC thing is scaring me to death. I don't know what to do at the moment so that's why I'm posting here. I'm not finding any information that is comforting and all of it is leading to IBC and worst case scenario stuff. I should be studying for an exam but now I'm worrying about this. I know I shouldn't worry about it until I know - but I can't help it. Our family has recently lost a friend to cancer and it's something that's been on my mind lately. I don't even know what to say. I'm stressing. I'm worried. I wish the spot wasn't there. I'm just freaking out a bit... or more than a bit. Any advice at all would be appreciated. Sorry for such an unorganized post - I'm just worried.  Log in to post a reply",
