Then, I had a very strange side effect fromVicadin and was curious if anyone else has experienced anything similar.  The day of surgery I noticed that I was being very particular about things that would not normally bother me.  It was like I was suddenly suffering from Obsessive compulsive disorder.  I couldn't stand to see the closet door open or the suitcase left on the bed.  If my husband didn't do what i wanted immediately, I would get really upset.  Once I was home the next day, my son couldn't find my discharge papers and I freaked!  I was crying hysterically even though my rational mind knew that I had all the information I needed already.  My dosages were all on the prescription bottles.  However, my OCD/Vicadin mind kept strongly saying \"I want those 2 pieces of paper, and I want them NOW!\"  The doctors office offered to fax over a copy of the papers, and assured me I would be fine, but at that moment nothing could console me.  I wanted what I wanted when I wanted it, and give it to me! I felt like a 2 year old having a tantrum.  I could feel my chest swelling from the heaving from the hysterical crying.  I knew i was doing myself no good, but could not shake the feeling. IfI have indeed had an insight into what people suffering from OCD go through, I truly feel for them.  I would find it very difficult to deal with those feelings on a daily basis. I'm happy to say that my prescription was changed to percocette, and everything is so much better now.  Of course, I'm still sore, but my mental state has improved dramatically. Anyone else out there have a similar story? DCIS diagnosed April 2008, Grade 3, Comedo Necrosis Log in to post a reply",

I wish you luck that your draining slows down, so that you can get rid of those drains.  I know what a pain they are.  I was told I can't shower until they're out, so needless to say I feel YUCK.  My husband took me to a salon to get my hair washed, and I cried from being so happy to have at least my hair look and smell decent. Just remember, this is the time in your life to let others do for you, so that you can get better faster.  I think it's hard for women to do this, we're used to being the doers.  Have patience with yourself, and think healing thoughts.
