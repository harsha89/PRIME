Tuesday I had the PET scan, Wednesday I had an MRI, today I will have a lymphnode biopsy, then head straight to the surgeon immediately after for a punch biopsy. Next week, I have an echocardiogram. I had to see a dentist for a referral to an oral surgeon due to dental problems that need corrected before I begin chemo. I don't know the results of the PET scan or MRI, I'm assuming the oncologist is waiting for all tests to be done to have the big picture. I am praying with all my might that it hasn't spread. The punch biopsy will tell me if I have inflammatory breast cancer. After 3 weeks of its presence, I have to assume that the oncologist is correct. The final pathology report did come back that included the predictive markers. I don't know what they mean really. On tumor one: Estrogen receptor -18% - positive Progesterone receptor - 0.1% - negative Her-2/neu - 1+ - negative On tumor 2: Estrogen receptor - 50% - positive Progesterone receptor - 0.10% - negative Her-2/neu - 0 - negative At the moment, I am sitting here waiting for another 2 1/2 hours for the lymphnode biopsy. I'm sooo thirsty. I don't know why I can't have anything to eat or drink 8 hours before this one. I hadn't had dietary restrictions with the tumor biopsy. Log in to post a reply",
