I had gone at end of day to my long time hairdresser's as I knew I would cry.

My scalp and remaining hair follicles were tender and irritable for a while. Initially, it was a shock to look in the mirror too as I would forget sometimes. I had 2 synthetic but realistic wigs to wear in public, as I couldn't manage to tie a scarf to look good.",

Interesting comment Rebecca, re chemo hair not dyeing well -- my initial growth of silver tabby cat fur didn't respond well at all to getting it coloured at about 5 months, and instead of streaky blonde/light brown as before, it went dirty carpet beige....... But it is taking colour well now, and the curly poodle look one year later is now gentle waves.... I even wonder if it will go straight again -- I kinda like some curl! Strangely, I have much less grey underneath now too. I get tons of compliments, and won't go long again. I might go blonder still KCinmn, seeing your great colour!!",

I made the big jump to colour it finally, as I want to go grey on my terms ...NOT due to FBC. It's an ok blonde, but it seems as if it won't take the highlights as well as it used to. At least my weird little bald patch is growing in.... stress alopecia?? Great cut on you :) I only did a little trim so far, so use goopy product to style. My next step is to cut one side close, and let the other continue to grow more. Trvler, how did your colouring turn out? Hair is a big deal for many of us. Those who make 'it's just hair' comments, aargh I feel like saying ok shave yours. I felt my big toenails were another reminder of my cancer -- they got thick and weird, but now almost grown through finally. When I had to be polish free for the diep surgery, and then couldn't reach them for a while after, so stared at them constantly from my recliner, a friend said something about it being just a superficial cosmetic thing......

Thanks for idea Cubbie re #28, but I need to travel 500 miles to see my PS and I refuse to fly with my already pufferfish foob [not to be confused with Kate's oh so adorable little red fish], and PS appt is on Tuesday, and will be going by land not air on Sunday and returning Thursday, so only option would be #28 the following Friday.... and I don't know if that's a good idea..... I go to my #24 later today and will ask. Etnasgirl, I was told by my PS the radiated side will lift higher [already doing that] and shrink some time after [tho currently puffy]. Yikes indeed Scotland re pink up or turn up the dial - wow :(. I am not having my stage 2 diep til >6 months post rads to give things time to settle down and heal properly, and will likely need a bit of fat grafting then, tho currently [but temporarily] it's the bigger one. My initial diep created a lovely matched pair. I have no bolus and no boosts - just 28 [or 27] straight up identical sessions. No dietary restrictions either, except only 1 green tea, and no antioxidant pill form products. Sending hugs to those who are anxious, frustrated, having side effects, doing pretty good,new or finishing up -- in other words everyone! Re the cream effectiveness comments - my RO kind of poopoos their effectiveness too......apparently new skin grows from inside, but a dear friend of mine in California accidentally did a very scientific test last summer -- she had a lumpectomy scar 1 inch on problem side that got radiated, and a similar 1 inch biopsy scar same area on good side that was not radiated....... she routinely gooped up with Miaderm, and after all the rads were done the miaderm scar was far paler -- as well, there was a section of skin high up under arm pit that she had not creamed as she had not known it was in the field of rads, and it was significantly pinker !! So I say cream away :) Best case - it really helps. Worse case - you feel good and it doesn't hurt. '",

Last eve I showed a friend the final result one week post rads-- a variety of mottled dark and light pink and also dark reddish tan on chest and under boob where sun has been in my bikini days, so not the same shade all over, and sprinkle in a few dark spots, and red road rash-- she said I look like an Apaloosa, and we had a great belly splitting laugh!!! Sore and tender in arm pit [using polysporin] but looking forward to the healing and fading. Fatigue has hit more as well. My PS had been quite pleased with how it has turned out so far, but said it would be an idea to get one of those sun shirts, esp when I am out kayaking or paddle boarding as sun can sneak through a bathing suit.

I try to channel my Nana.... her famous phrase \"don't borrow trouble\" :) I am creaming like crazy too. As I only have one tube of the American product Miaderm, I branched out and ordered My Girls on amazon, as it is available in Canada, but now the rad nurse wants to see if they will approve it, as every province has different things they allow. It does not seem completely water based, so may not pass:( Etnasgirl -- my boob has always been hotter after tx from the beginning [now 11 of 20] but hasn't gotten any worse yet. My place recommends saline soaks. 2 tsp salt dissolved in 2 litres [quarts] boiled water then cooled to room temp. in a mixing bowl. Lasts a day or two. Dip a clean quarter folded facecloth and lay across breast for 20 min or so, and repeat 3 x day.

Justmaximom - congrats on going to work 'au natural' -- when I first did I was so stressed before hand, but reaction was great, and it felt very freeing to be me, and as hair has grown and changed I now say I am in the hair of the month club! Kateb although I have pretty trees to look at on the ceiling, I would wwwaaaaay rather have a fun fish! Feeling a little prickly itchiness starting above breast in area that normally gets lots of sun, but rest holding up ok after #23 of 28. I realized yesterday after I got the appt card times for next week, that they are not open for Family Day this Monday [a Canadian holiday -- quite new to BC, so I hadn't factored that in]. The plus means a long weekend, but the negative is I need to miss #28 which has now been scheduled for the following Monday. I have a pre-booked, can't change appt in Vancouver with PS to check the results of rads. It is due to new RO initially forgetting I had diep, so he had changed me to 16 instead of 28, and when I pointed out I was supposed to do 28 it took a few days to recalibrate......................... I can't imagine only doing 27 of 28 will make a huge difference, as I am still in the therapeutic range.",

The 2 small rashy rawish bits that developed from friction in the darkest spots under arm and then under boob are long gone. I have not had any I am keeping up creams [using leftovers] but only after shower and pre bed. I still keep up the stretch routine too to maintain flexibility. About the antioxidant topic ... I too was told to stop all but a multivit [which has such a small amount they don't seem to worry], but restarted my usual handful 2 weeks after. I wanted to make sure my rads were as effective as possible. My fatigue is fading too and I am starting to feel pretty normal, but still doing only lighter activity or for shorter periods to minimize lymphedema risk. Snow shovel has been put away and I am contemplating garden thoughts:) I am also looking into a sun shirt for the summer as recommended by my PS - t shirt to wear in water [I do a lot of kayaking and paddle boarding at the lake in summer] to block UV as that skin will be uber sensitive for a long time. A lot of fashionable options when you google it. I see my RO for a final followup April 1st ... April fool's day! oh Sunny - you are too funny! Loved the champagne gum balls:) I did 28 too. Best wishes to all on their treatment path.",

I had the weird small dark freckly things start to appear about 1/2 way thru rads. When I asked my RO he said -- oh they aren't moles [which take a very long time to develop] and shouldn't be there a few months from now..... yipes. BUT the good news is that they already faded away -- in fact, quite suddenly as my pink/tan colouring returned to normal abut 3-4 weeks after, .... it was a surprise as I suddenly noticed their absence one day! They are completely gone now. I am keeping up the stretchy shoulder arm routines whenever I think of it to avoid and minimize tightness. My breast is looking pretty darn good, considering I had diep before. I do need to wait at least 6 months for stage 2 nip and tweaking though, but am happy to.",
