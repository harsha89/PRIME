I know it's silly and you would think after losing it before I would be okay with it. But actually it bothers me more.

Please reconsider an antidepressant, they make you get over the hump of not wanting to get out of bed and the hopeless feeling. I do take Effexor but if that didn't work for you, maybe try another one. There are many different ones out there and maybe something else would suit you better. Try to think that no one knows how long you have. Don't you want to enjoy each day to the fullest that you can. Try to do something that you really enjoy and savor the moment. Set small goals that you want to see and do and accomplish them and set more. Just try to learn to live in the moment. I do know it's hard, but consider some of my suggestions.

I think when your mortality has been put in your face, the mind has no choice but to change in order to survive. It definitely teaches some values that sadly enough is not learnt until then. My favorite saying is, We don't remember the days, we remember the moments. I do realize this is not a place to discuss religion and respect everyone else's opinion, but I do believe God is in control of everything. Miracles only happen through him, medical technology would not be where it is today if God hadn't intended it to be. I try to concentrate on faith, I have faith that what is meant to be , will be.

At least go see your oncologist and see if they think it is any different. Peace of mind is worth everything. The psychological part is the hardest. I was recently referred to see a cancer psychologist but haven't went. I figure we all worry about the beast coming back. You take care Kandie",

I went through several drugs with nothing stopping the progression. In January we switched to chemo. Finally 2 weeks ago we reached stable status. Psychologically it's hard. But I keep reading on this forum that there are many ladies that do well even with liver mets. I'm hoping that once you find something that stops progression, you will feel better too.

I'm hoping for relief soon. I'm taking OxyContin 80mg, 3x a day, dexamethasone twice a day, and dilaudid. I can take it every 2 hours. It's a wonder I am awake, lol. I am thrilled for you, so happy. Take care, enjoy the moment. Praying for everyone.",

My upper back doesn't really hurt at all now, my lower back still does but definitely more manageable. I met with my MO today. I will get scanned the end of next week to see if Halaven is doing any good. We are anticipating progression again. My tumor markers have been spot on every time. Once again they doubled, now I'm over 3400. He wants me to try Keytruda, although it is only being given to triple negative patients. He is starting the ball rolling to see if they will give it to me. I'm hoping they will cause I feel like I'm running out of good option. So far, nothing has worked since hormonals stopped working.

There was no way I could physically do my job anymore, before I got my stage 4 diagnosis it had became nearly impossible for me to make it through my 3, 12 hour shifts. So, when I found out I was stage 4, I went out and never went back. I do miss my job, and especially the interaction with my coworkers, but for me it was an easy decision since I could no longer do it. So while you are out on STD, think about it and decide what is best for you. Wishing you the best",

Also I think that someone that has a recurrence, their cancer was resistant to chemo drugs and a hormonal. So their cancer has already figured out how to get around certain drugs.

No matter what the length of time is since your original diagnosis, it is very hard to wrap your head around and accept it. With time, it will all be clearer to you. I would think that they will schedule you for a biopsy, which will confirm it for you. If they don't schedule it, then I would highly recommend you requesting it to be done. The biopsy will tell whether the receptors are the same as your original or if they have changed. That's very important info for your treatment plan. You asked how rare it was for it to come back after 11 years, I don't know statistics but it does happen. A Dr told me that the only way you would know that you actually survived breast cancer, was when you died from something else. There is a chance of it coming back 30, 40 years or whatever the lengh of time. I'm sure you ll feel much better after you see the oncologist and get questions answered and a treatment plan in place. To answer your question as far as how they can be sure, there are certaIn things they look at on a scan that tells them rather or not it is suspicious for cancer. The way the lesion looks on imaging. It was probably read out as highly suspicious or very worrisome for cancer. Like I said above I'm sure they will probably biopsy. I wish you the best.

In Sept I had multiple recheck appts, found out tumor markers had doubled which started a whole series of events. Been a roller coaster ride to get here but after the second biopsy, I was confirmed mets to the left pelvis. I have found it most surprising and scary, how quickly this became painful. I have seen my radiation oncologist and he is starting stereotactic radiation next week. Planning on doing 5 treatments. I haven't seen a medical oncologist yet, long story there. I am switching because of the series of events that led me up to this diagnosis. So I am not sure what they will have in mind.

Also if you drop it down lower than the heart that helps. Other than that, it is a matter as to what vein of yours wants to pop up and how good the person that is sticking is. At my facility, you can not stick a person but twice, then someone else has to try. I am a CT tech and was very good at locating veins.

I think that only you knows the answer to your question. My motto always is enjoy the moment. So you must decide what will bring you the most joy. My take on what you wrote is, going to school is really important to you cause obviously you applied even knowing you are stage 4. Now, you must be having second thoughts knowing the reality of your diagnosis. But the funny thing is, if you didn't have this diagnosis, you would go on to school not even thinking about when or if something would happen to you. It definitely makes you think about how you want to spend every moment of your time doesn't it. So, back to what I originally said, you must decide how you want to spend your time. I am also from the medical field, I can tell you it is very stressful, but also very rewarding. I am out on disability and am thankful I no longer have that stress in my life. But once again, you must decide what's important to you. I wish you the best. Enjoy the moment",

MRI was done last Monday. That confirmed mets. It was not read out as highly suspicious or very concerning, the report said left ilium metaphysis consistent with abnormal PET. So that led me to the biopsy on Thursday. They did it by CT guidance. When he woke me up, the radiologist told me that it was a very difficult biopsy. He had a very hard time getting the needle in and at that only got a couple pieces. He stated that he hoped it was enough for them. So on Friday my oncologist called, she was ecstatic. She said the biopsy was normal, go celebrate. I was floored. I couldn't think quick enough but did get out I didn't understand that when the scans said differently. She said it was negative go celebrate. I asked her if we were going to recheck this and she said I will see you in 6 months. I think I am even more distraught. I feel like either I am a walking miracle or they missed it on the biopsy, quite honestly the latter of the 2 makes more sense. This is my field of work so I do realize that machines don't lie but there is human error. So my question to you is where do I go from here? The thought of waiting 6 months is devastating. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks ladies.",

Being allergic to a scratch Ashley had 9 claws on the front and 7 on the back. Her feet looked like a catchers mitt. Funny thing she never scratched anyone. My girls would hold her and jump on a trampoline and take her down the slide. She tolerated it all. I began to think that she was going to outlive us all but I guess that didn't happen.

They are giving me all the premeds. I think they are too concerned of the possibility that I'm going to react and so they have tried to cover every base to make sure it doesn't happen. The port worked well, it is still very sore and bruised, so to accesss it really hurt. I had used the numbing cream, but it didn't help today. I did get my results back from the MRI brain. It showed progression in the skull mets but no brain mets. I was thrilled about that. Once again, I took along TarheelMichelle in my pocket. She texted and sent pics for 4 hours while I was at the cancer center. Time flew by and I laughed a lot. Special thanks to her. We actually live pretty close so we are meeting for dinner tomorrow night. How cool is that? I came home and had to take an afternoon nap, those premeds make me so sleepy.Thank you all for all the support and advice you have given me. It's nice to know others that understand. Wishing everyone the very best. Enjoy the moment.",

Another reason why I call TarheelMichelle my angel in my pocket. She seems to have appeared at exactly the perfect time. I've always saidGod puts the right people in your life when needed and takes people out that are no longer needed. I'm hoping she sticks around, cause she definitely lightens up my day.

He said it was only going to get worse cause I'm rubbing bone against bone. He is referring me back to the orthopedic oncologist to evaluate to do total hip replacement. I told him that I did not think I was in any physical shape to go through another surgery. He said that it needed to be evaluated cause it will get where I can't walk again. You know, I really feel like I deserve a break. It was bad enough that by the time I got over something, something else occurred. But now it's pouring.

About to break 1000. Yuck. Not sure this is working either. On the bright side, I'm on my way back home from Gatlinburg. We rented a 4BR cabin and took all the kids with us. We stayed for 7 days. It was wonderful to have everyone together. It was also bittersweet, I had to wonder if this was our last family outing. I hope all you ladies are doing well. Remember to enjoy the moment. I'll post a couple pics. Even our unexpected visitor, lol.  ",

Tried to get into the trash but it was in a bear cage. Then he laid out on the railing before he decided to mosy off. I guess I felt a little safer cause my son and his girlfriend both had guns on them. But looking back on it, it was probably really dumb of us. We did enjoy the time with the kids.

By Friday I thought I was getting much better. Saturday morning I woke up really sick. Didn't have any idea what had caused it. The rest of the weekend I ran a fever of 102, 103. There should be a law that states, no adult is allowed to have a fever that high. Kids might can handle that but an adult can't , lol. . First thing Monday morning I called MO. They said, get dressed and get over here. They did a bunch of labs and a chest X-ray. As I had already figured out, I have pneumonia, plus an UTI. Not sure where that came from since I don't even have symptoms. Anyway they put me on antibiotics and let me leave. By the time I got home they were calling again. Said another lab result was in and I was extremely dehydrated. Said I was going to have to come back and get fluids. They said if they couldn't get me feeling better within a couple hours they were admitting me. This time I had to call DH to see if he could take off work and take me. I just didn't have the energy to drive back over there again. After a couple hours there they let me go again. The worst part is they are canceling my chemo this week. They said I was so close to being admitted as it was that if they gave me chemo, that would throw it over the edge. Great, just got to an okay spot and now we cancel chemo. I really don't have any luck at all. Hoping all of you are doing good, enjoy the moment.",

At the end of December I had a pet scan that showed progression. My oncologist said we were going to hold off and see if A/A would kick in. Then my tumor markers started rising again and I am having quite a bit of pain. Overall, not doing well. So today oncologist said, it's not working. So sad. He wanted to start giving me Abraxane, we will start that next week. Also, scheduled me to have my port put back in, I thought I was done the first time and had it removed. I am so sad over the news. I feel like this is really the beginning of the end. I really would love to have more time and just want Harper to be able to remember me. I knew that this would happen at some point, but I really wasn't prepared for it to move so quick. Dang it. I wish all of you the best.

They do give Premeds to help prevent you from having a reaction. They give benedryll so that might make you sleepy. The nurse stays with you for the first 15 minutes to make sure you don't react. Each unit takes 2 hours to go in. So if you are getting 2 units you will be there at least 5 hours. Pretty simple, just time consuming. I wish you the best.",

I really didn't think he would let me have chemo yet. But surprisingly, he did. I was in so much pain when I got there. MO was not happy at all about that. He said they were going to give me dilaudid and stop that at least for a little bit. Man, was that sweet, all the pain disappeared and I was not the least bit sleepy. I was like, can I have that every day. He did up the pain meds again, he is trying hard to control it, but it seems impossible. They did say that they thought chemo was helping to control the pain and by missing last week had made it worse. I think there is some truth in that cause I do feel much better this morning. I did have another reaction to carbo yesterday but it wasn't as bad as the first time. Two Benadryl took care of it. My labs looked pretty good yesterday and my blood counts were back up, so the transfusion last week was a success. It would be nice if they would stay up, but a couple weeks of chemo will knock them back down. My chest X-ray looked good, so thankfully the antibiotic knocked my pneumonia right out. Hooray for that. So I do believe we must live one day at a time, and today is a good day. I feel so much better than I have and am thankful for that. I believe today will be a pool day. Hooray. I hope everyone has a fantastic day. Enjoy the moment ladies, prayers for each one of you. Z, I do hope you are feeling better, you are always so upbeat, that it is disheartening to hear that something is wrong. I hope today is a good day for you. Hugs.",

I actually did ask the question to a Dr that I was so confused. I didn't understand how in the world I could be dehydrated when I drink so much. I actually drink at least 15-8 ounces of water a day. This is how it was explained to me. If your body is fighting a bad infection it doesn't matter how much water you drink, you can not keep up with it. Then your Albumin will drop. Once that happens your body will no longer allow your body to absorb any liquid that you take in. So everything you drink is either peed out or it lets it escape out of the vessels causing some peripheral swelling. Which in return makes the situation even worse. If your body has already went sepsis, your body is shutting down, nothing is working properly anymore and the result is death unless they can turn the situation around quick enough. For this to happen the infection must be being killed by powerful antibiotics and fluids ran in continually. Although it is very important to stay hydrated or you will become dehydrated it will not cause sepsis. It's actually the other way around. Thank you all for the continuing prayers. I really still need them. I found out tonight that during the last month that I've been sick my tumor markers have went up over 700 points. I almost cried. Looks like cancer loves to play while you are skipping chemo cause you are too sick to do it. I'm now over 1700, the highest they have been ever. If sepsis doesn't kill me cancer is. I was lucky enough to get off of ICU today. They said I was so much better than yesterday. Prayers to all of you. Keep your chin up and keep moving forward. God is in control",

      "Content": "Aug 3, 2017 04:51AM - edited Aug 3, 2017 04:54AM by Kandy Just a quick update. Yesterday I found out my tumor markers have risen over 700 points in the last month and that would be with me just missing 1 treatment. Obviously, I became very upset. They are now over 1700. The hospitalist came in and said because this has happened he did not think my MO would give me chemo for at least 2 weeks. Hmmm. Counting because last week was my week off from chemo, that would mean going 4 weeks with no chemo. I became more upset. I was like great, that means my markers will be over 5000 before I get it again. My MO is out of town this week, so they called his partner to come talk to me. He said that actually if I was his patient he wouldn't give chemo for 3 months. More upset. He said he was afraid the chemo was causing the pneumonia and each time it gets worse. That one of these times they aren't going to be able to control it. In fact, he said the next chemo could be the one that would do it. His recommendation was to try a hormonal. I told him that I had discussed going back on hormonals with my MO and he had said he wanted to do that but he needed a 3 month window that he could try it, have time to see if it would work and if it didn't to revert back to chemo and him have time to get it back under control. And my MO didn't feel like he had that 3 month window. He said this is true but it might be the chance we have to take. That he felt like I was close to dying from complications from chemo. So, what to do. He said that of course it would be up to my mo. He was very concerned about the rising markers and the fact that they rose that much just with 1 missed chemo and felt like maybe this isn't working anyway. So he ordered a CT to be done last night to see what's up. He will come back to see me today and let me know what they say. The other thing the nurse told me was I'm peeing out 3 times the amount I'm taking in. That obviously there is no way I can keep up with that and if they send me home I will be right back for dehydration. We have no idea why this is happening but she has left the Drs a note that they need to look into this. Ladies thank you all for all the kind words and holding me up in prayer. I'm hanging in there. In case at some point I go MIA, y'all can't get in touch with TarheelMichelle. She has even came to visit so she knows what's happening here. Thank you TarheelMichelle for being a great friend. Keep the prayers coming and I'm also lifting each of you up in prayer. Enjoy the moment",

She was diagnosed with lung cancer. She did have some treatment done but the docs here told her that she only had about 6 months to live. Her son lived in California and was a nurse. He came and got her and she lived the remainder of her time with him. He fixed her brownies with CBD, and I'm not sure how else he got it in her. But her 6 months to live turned into 8 years. I felt like that was a huge difference in time. Now we don't know for sure that the CBD extended her life but I think it's a good possibility. Hopefully you will also have great results. Praying for you and everyone else. Hang in there Lita",

The number one way to prevent most that can be prevented is strict hand washing. So pay attention to employees and make sure they wash their hands when they enter and exit your room. If they don\u2019t, kindly ask them to. But with that being said, there are so many ways that happens. If a urinary catheter is left in too long the patient will get a UTI, which then it is a HAC cause they got it while at the hospital. Now with Medicare saying they will not reimburse for HAC\u2019s, hospitals here in the US has had to make some major changes to try harder to prevent them. Like where I live they pull a urinary catheter out after 24 hours rather you need it left in or not. They would rather clean up urine, give you a bath, and get reimbursed. So even tho I know it\u2019s concerning, in your situation as long as you get everyone to wash their hands, I think you will be just fine. Looking forward to hearing about your treatment. Keeping you lifted high in prayer. I hope my explanation eased your worries some",

I'm not sure if sometimes when people react that way iit isbecause they are hurting and can't cope. Anyway, for my mom, it is about her, not anyone else. I really try to avoid telling her any specifics because of this. She does say she is hurt cause she doesn't know what is going on. But when she does know, she uses it to spread my news to everyone she knows, so she can get sympathy from them. Being I really know how you feel, no matter what, it still hurts that your mom is no support. I try to lean heavily on friends and family that treat me better and as far as cancer I chose to leave my mom out of it. Even though she is hurt, I tell myself that if she acted differently, she would be involved. But since she don't, and I can't control how she acts, then it's best this way. I certainly hope and pray for things to turn around for you soon. I do hope that you can figure out how to find peace in this situation. Wishing you only the best.",

Plus depending on the slice distance of a CT, It could have missed something if it was between slices. There are a couple things you could consider to ease your mind. You could ask for another follow up bone scan in 3 months to see if it is still there or has changed in any way. You could ask for the radiologist to review the CT again with the bone scan to make sure it wasn't there on the CT and was missed. I think I would ask for it to be reviewed again and depending on what they say would determine what I would want done next. I wish you the best. Praying for you and everyone else on this forum",

After you qualify for SSDI, any child under 18 or any child with a disability regardless of their age pulls from your disability. Their amount is half what you are awarded. If your child already gets social security, my child did, this is converted to your disability because it is typically a higher amount and comes from a different fund. Hope this helps.",

I had one bone met of the ileum and had that radiated in 2013. Summer of 2015 my hip, leg started hurting. It was so bad I would cry at night time. One time it even caused me to pass out. They xrayed and did a CT, both were normal. Even did a Pet that showed nothing new. After 3 months with horrible pain and it progressing with how bad it hurt they sent me to an orthopedic that did a MRI arthrogram. That showed a small hairline fracture through the acetabulum. From there things got worse until I finally had major pelvis reconstruction. I was a CT tech, trust me if the MRI didn't show anything a regular X-ray will not. X-rays are less sensitive. But I think from my experience, I feel like things are happening deep in the bone causing our pain, we can feel it but it's not big enough for imaging to pick it up yet. I sometimes feel like with time whatever will show up. I think I would definitely go to an orthopedic to see what they think. Wishing you the best",

He says it will never happen, I think it will because he's a good catch. Plus he is still young to think he will not want a partner. He's 58. I can't say I don't think about it anymore, but like Ms Divine says, you can't control it. It might have became easier when I went on anti anxiety and antidepressants. If you are not taking something, I strongly recommend it. I also have mixed emotions about this. I want him to find happiness cause he deserves it. If that helps then maybe that eases the pain.

I do think you need to call the Dr, just to get it checked out and hopefully everything will be fine and it will put her mind at ease. Vertigo can be caused by many things. When I was doing CT scans, it was unbelievable how many people have that issue. The main reason is from inner ear trouble. There are actually tiny rocks inside your ear, if they get off balance, it will cause severe vertigo. Typically this will take care of itself with time. The twitching of the eye is typically from lack of sleep or stress. I would bet you have both, right now. So my suggestion is to call your Dr, let them scan your head, and hopefully put your mind at ease. In the meantime, please be careful. Vertigo likes to throw your balance off and you sure don't need a fall. I will be praying for everything to be just fine. Merry Christmas tou you",

When you get a terminal diagnosis it plays with your mind that the end might now be visible. I think it is so much a mind game.

As soon as I went liver mets my MO started doing MRIs. But what I was trying to say is the first one really can't be compared to a CT. It will be the second one where they are comparing MRI to MRI that will really give you your answer. Each modality is very different and each modality is better for some things than another. With liver mets, MRI is definitely the modality of choice. As far as contrast, the contrast follows the vascular system of the body. It is a timed process that they start scanning when the contrast is in the liver. The contrast enhances the liver and therefore makes the liver more visible. Cancer is always very vascular. So, they like to do a without contrast first, now the lesions that are seen on the without is compared to the lesions that are seen with contrast. If the lesions enhance with the contrast, that indicates that it is cancer, if the lesion does not enhance then typically it is not cancer. I hope that makes sense. Sometimes it's hard to explain in writing. But I would recommend it being done with contrast, it helps them to know what is cancer and what is not. Is there a reason why you don't want contrast? If this doesn't make sense, tell me and I will try again. Praying for you. One more thing, it is crazy that it wasn't picked up for 9-12 months on the PET. I would really question the radiologist reading. That is really scary to me.",

It just makes it where we can think more clearly. I am also one that is ogliometastatic. I had one spot on my pelvis. I had stereotactic radiation that literally destroyed that spot. I have been NED since. This October will be 3 years for me. There is a lot of hope here. I hope your visit with the oncologist goes well. If you are not satisfied with what they say then seek a second opinion. Wishing you nothing but the best.",

But I realistically know he will survive. We have 3 children that are grown and the 2 oldest will be just like my husband, they will be fine and will survive. The youngest is my biggest concern. She is 24 and has Down syndrome. She will have a very hard time when something happens. I worry about how she will survive and hope she will be happy. I worry about who will take care of her so my DH can continue to work. Last but not least it is devastating to think that someday I will just be a distant memory",

Plus, I somehow feel like my cancer went crazy on my last surgery, I certainly don't have room for it to be even more aggressive.

Cancer center called this morning and wanted me to come back over there. They wanted to repeat labs, get more fluids and see MO. So we got the labs done and they said my hemoglobin had dropped since Monday. It was already too low then. So I got fluids, they decided I should get blood tomorrow, and hopefully be able to get chemo again on Tuesday. My fever had finally broke last night and they were happy with that. That obviously we were headed in the right direction. Then MO fussed at me for waiting till Monday to call. Said I should have called and I would have been told to go to ER. I said I didn't feel like it was an emergency. He said obviously I didn't understand how quick chemo patients can go septic. And if that happens most of their patients don't make it. And that will be the end. So anyone out there that thinks the same as I do, I warn you that your oncologist is not happy when you don't follow directions enjoy your evening and the moment.",

He really wants my liver in a better spot before trying hormonals again. So Halaven it is. Pray that this one will do some good. I also told him I wanted my liver biopsied, he put the order in for them to do it Thursday, I will have to wait for scheduling to call to see if that will happen then.

I seem to improve right before I get it again. I'm hoping maybe my body will adjust to it. My hair, eyelashes, eyebrows are all starting to grow back. I'm thankful for that, but then I wonder if it's all growing back does that mean it's not effecting the cancer either. I really wish that this nightmare would be over and I would wake up and know it was all just a dream. I'm sure everyone feels that way.

I really haven't felt well lately. If it's not one thing it's another. Sometimes my back hurts worse than before rads. Literally breaking into. Then I'm still having stomach issues, since I came home from the hospital. I either feel nauseated, and vomiting with it, or it just hurts. Feels like I'm full all the time, so full that it's in my throat. This morning was bad, not a piece on me didn't hurt. I sat at the end of the bed crying, told DH just to go ahead and bury me. By the afternoon I did have it better controlled. If this isn't depressing enough, I'm having trouble getting new treatment lined up and I just know cancer is having a big party as we waste my time. Tumor markers are now over 4000. I seen MO this week, he told me he still hadn't been able to get keytruda lined up. After discussing some options I asked him why we hadn't tried Ibrance. For some reason he thought we had. Maybe because I just cruised through my options. Anyway, he did feel like it was worth a try especially since we don't have keytruda in place. So I started Letrazole but still don't have Ibrance. Mine has to go through cvs specialty pharmacy and they still haven't approved it. Just seems like nothing works out smoothly. Hopefully I will get it soon. I hope everyone is doing well, keeping everyone lifted in prayer",

I didn't feel well through the weekend, even with getting blood on Saturday. On Tuesday morning, I woke up so sick. Stomach was killing me and vomiting. My husband was too afraid to leave me to go to work. Called MO, they decided to do a brain MRI. They did that and sent me over to get fluids. MO came to talk. He said the MRI showed mets in the dura, he said it was where there are numerous mets in the skull and is afraid that if something isn't done the skull will fracture. He is checking with RO to see if he will radiate so hopefully that doesn't happen. There is another new place in the brain that was questioned to be mets. Recommended very short follow up. So I suspect we are moving on into the brain. I feel like there is no stopping it. He changed meds, hopefully to make me feel better. In the past 4 weeks I have lost 20 pounds. Too much weight too fast. I have no appetite. And always feel like if I eat, the vomiting will start. Now I really don't have any more weight to give up so I hope that stops soon. I can't decide if I feel so bad because of mets or do I feel so bad cause of side effects. MO also thinks the liver needs to be radiated to reduce the swelling. They are still trying to get me approved for keytruda under passionate allowance. There is a team of oncologist that meet to discuss difficult cases to see if others have a better idea. He is presenting my case on Monday. I see him again on Tuesday so maybe he will have a new plan. ThInking and praying for each of you. Keep the prayers coming that they find something that works fast on this cancer that seems unstoppable. Love and hugs to all of you.",

Found out yesterday that I was approved to take keytruda. It will be interesting to see if he goes ahead and changes me or if he waits another month to see if Ibrance has done any good.

As far as your mother, I am so sorry for your loss. I agree with others that no matter her age or circumstance she was still your mom and that is a very devastating loss. It sounds like your sister has her own issues but irregardless that was very disrespectful to not tell of your mom's passing. Unfortunately that time is gone and no one can change that. Take time to grieve, reflect on good memories of your mom. You know in your heart that under the circumstances you did the best you could so no reason for any feelings of guilt. I am fortunate enough that my kids are over those teenage years. God bless everyone that is dealing with teenagers plus MBC. I really don't know how you do it. When mine was teenagers they just about drove me crazy. But the good news is, they do grow up and most of the time they grow up to be very respectful adults. I couldn't be more proud of mine now and those trying teenage years are just a distant memory. Probably time to show some tough love, try to find out what the problem is, and let him know that if you are footing the bill this is what you expect. Remember this too shall pass. I really hate you had to visit the ED. Ulcerative colitis? That is usually brought on by nerves, try not to let everything get to you. I know easier said than done. I hope the antibiotics are already helping the situation. And if you haven't had enough thrown at you, let's talk significant progression. Geeez. I know what you mean by using up all of your options, I'm right there with you and I just flew right through them. My MO said that my cancer just laughs at chemo. I sure am glad someone finds it humorous. But I agree with others, there's always hope. Try to keep your chin up and believe he will find the right drug to turn the situation around. Sometimes it's hard not to think, would my family not be better if I was gone. But I can assure you, your family loves you very much and they are more than willing to do whatever it takes to keep you here. My DH and I have had this conversation a few times. Of course, my DH likes to live in the land of DeNile most of the time. He has assured me that he would give up everything he has if he could just keep me here. I'm sure yours and everyone else's feels the same. Yes, our families will recover, that is what human nature is about, but their life will be changed forever. It won't be for the better or the way they wanted it. So keep fighting girl, they want you here. You asked how others keep going. I think you answered that yourself after you asked. At least that is why I keep fighting. My family means the world to me, I want every second I can squeeze out with them. I feel bad for my DH too. I don't know how he does it. He also has to show up for work with a smile like everything in his life is great. When in reality he is dealing with my problems, me calling saying I just can't do this or that. His response of don't worry I'll take care of it. We have a 26yo that has Down syndrome, he is wonderful with her, but I'm sure he's worried about how he is going to work and take care of her when I'm no longer here. We have a rental house that he has to keep up plus deal with the renters.Plus we have a place at the beach that he is totally renovating. I honestly think he has more stress than I do. I figure if he can keep fighting, surely I can. I am praying for you, just like I pray for everyone else on this forum. Rather you believe or not doesn't effect that. I do think talking to a therapist is a good idea. Sometimes there are so many things going on that we feel like we are drowning. Therapist can help sort the issues out so it's not so overwhelming. Be kind to yourself, you have had a really bad week. We are all standing by your side, pull your strength from others. Praying that today is the start of a much better week",

I had several new bone mets in September with one liver met. I was switched to Afinitor and Aromasin. For 2 months my markers were dropping and we were all excited. At the end of December I had a pet scan that showed progression. My oncologist said we were going to hold off and see if A/A would kick in. Then my tumor markers started rising again and I am having quite a bit of pain. Overall, not doing well. So today oncologist said, it's not working. So sad. He wanted to start giving me Abraxane, we will start that next week. Also, scheduled me to have my port put back in, I thought I was done the first time and had it removed. I am so sad over the news. I feel like this is really the beginning of the end. I really would love to have more time and just want Harper to be able to remember me. I knew that this would happen at some point, but I really wasn't prepared for it to move so quick. Dang it. I wish all of you the best.

One more cycle, then we can scan to see how we are doing. I start radiation next week on 2 places on my back. Going to do 10 treatments and hoping it relieves some of the pain. But it seems like everyday a new place is hurting. Feeling a little down about it. I wonder just how bad it will get. Praying that god sees fit to heal us all. Hugs and love to all.",

Once again they doubled, now I'm over 3400. He wants me to try Keytruda, although it is only being given to triple negative patients. He is starting the ball rolling to see if they will give it to me. I'm hoping they will cause I feel like I'm running out of good option. So far, nothing has worked since hormonals stopped working. I think I need more than prayers now, I need a miracle. Praying for each one of you, that treatment works exceptionally well.",

If that is the case, he thinks they should radiate it to get it off the intestines. They got me in today for another blood transfusion so hopefully that will make me feel better soon.

I hate the paranoid syndrome that we are in and cant imagine if that will improve. My Oncologist told me on the last visit that I just needed to get on with my life and quit worrying about something that is not even there. Easier said than done. The whole body image thing kills me. I was small before this happened and lost about 25 pounds during treatment, now weighing in way under 100 pounds. That is just as bad as gaining weight, the skin just hangs off my body and I look like a swiveled up 90 year old lady. My hair was always long and now it being short and soooo curly that you cant pull the curls out of it. I absolutely hate it. Everytime I look in the mirror I am still trying to figure out who is looking back at me. I also hate for everyone commenting on my hair and of course everyone just loves it.

Progression depression is a great term, thanks Janis. Depressed is probably the understatement. The last 18 months have sucked. First the acetabulum fracture, can't walk for 6 months, literally thought that would drive me crazy, finally someone agrees to do a 10 hour major surgery that they are not sure I will live through it, then recovery time, finally I'm starting to walk again and low and behold my tumor markers start doubling every month. So in less than 6 months I go from Ned to too many lesions to even name, plus the liver, oh and the adrenal gland has been added. Anyone else out there have mets there? Leave it to me to put it everywhere. I just would like a small fraction of time that I felt good again, I have forgotten what that was like. My world has definitely been rocked, more like turned over. It's hard for me to think it's moving so quick and very scary. I do wish each and every one of you only the best. Y'all rock",

I went for chemo again yesterday finishing up my 2nd round. I get a week off then I will get chemo for 2 weeks and get scanned on the third week. Chemo went well yesterday and I seem to be tolerating it well. My hair is almost all gone and I'm very tired of shedding worse than a dog. I am going today to have the rest taken off. I ordered a wig last week and it came today. Hopefully I will like it better than my last one. Time will tell. Sure am dreading the no hair again. Even worse I found out yesterday that my tumor markers decided to double again this month. Now they are over 600. Great, did I lose my hair for nothing? MO said he was still hopeful and didn't want to change anything until I am scanned, that will tell him what is really going on. It seems like I just can't catch a break. I hope all of you are having better luck than me. Remember to enjoy the moment",

He said it would be about a week before the biopsy results was back but sometimes they could actually see damage to the small intestine and he could see it on her. He said he was going to put the liver on the back burner and monitor her labs. He's hoping that when she goes gluten free that her liver will straighten itself out. I'm praying for that too. If her liver functions continue to rise even with the new diet then she will have to have a liver biopsy to see if she really does have autoimmune hepatitis too. The hepatitis is what I'm most worried about. She will have a very difficult time adjusting to a gluten free diet but she has rose to every occasion so surely she will this time. Please keep her in your prayers, she means the world to us. Take care ladies and thanks for all the support. Enjoy the moment",

Not sure what is involved with that but I will find out more tomorrow. He is definitely planning on me staying on the carbo for now. That seemed to relieve some of my stress. It has really worried me that it seems like my body doesn't like chemo. My youngest DD leaves for camp tomorrow, she will be gone for the week. My DH is taking me to the beach for some alone time.

He said because so far no chemo has had any effect on it, that it\u2019s likely none will. So he\u2019s not thinking a chemo will work, and I have already failed hormonals. Not a good place to be. He is moving forward with trying to get me approved for keytruda. He said it would take about 2 weeks for an answer. If he gets this approved and it doesn\u2019t work either, I\u2019m not sure there will be many more options. Hopefully I\u2019m going home tomorrow. My hemoglobin has dropped to 7, so they said if it doesn\u2019t rise on tomorrow\u2019s lab work, they will do a transfusion and then I can go. My stomach still hurts but we are through with the IV antibiotics and have switched to oral. So I can take my pain meds at home and it is no different from being here.

We fought it for 1 year. To make it more amusing they determined I could work even with my acetabulum fracture. Right before I had my major surgery they decided that may be I couldn't work.

I have decided t go ahead and let them start chemo, first treatment is Tuesday. I feel like this is a race against time and I don't have time for something else to work at this point. But, after I get this bet into control where I have more time to think and research my possibilities I will be looking into what my other options are. Thanks Bestbird, I will definitely inquire about having the androgen tested. I'm definitely apprehensive about having this chemo. I was very allergic to taxol and taxotere but my MO says this is taxol but packaged differently. Pray that it goes well, I was anaphylactic shock with taxol. Looks like they can't get my port in till after my first chemo. Thanks to each and everyone for all the suggestions and the loving support. Y'all are awesome",

Now if I thought I was just doing this for a few month, I would jump on that. But hopefully it will work and I will be on it for a long time. I don't think I can pay that much per month with no end in sight. So I discarded that thought. I had chemo today, it went well. The PA was amazed that I still have so much hair. I told her my hair was really thick and each individual hair was thick therefore it was deceiving. She said the amount I have now is probably close to what most people have normally. But she said that it was still no indication of what was going to happen in the next couple weeks. Maybe I would be lucky but maybe not. Since I'm really not feeling like a lucky person I am not counting too much on it. So can someone explain to me in farther detail what happens with your fingernails? That bothers me too, I am a germ fanatic, if they look bad, I'm going to think germs. Oh boy, this just gets better and better doesn't it? So does everyone get a nail issue or just some? I'm praying for each and everyone of you. Treatment works and you are pain free. Enjoy the moment ladies",

Y'all make me feel like I'm not alone doing this and it means so much to me. I went yesterday evening to have the rest of my hair taken off. I held it together until the very end, then I couldn't hold my emotions any longer and cried. But on the bright side, at this point I do like my new wig so much better than my first one. It looks so similar to my own hair that I'm even amazed. DD with Down syndrome only asked if I had gotten a haircut and said it looks nice. I still haven't told her that I'm bald. She doesn't understand and it will freak her out. Last time she was a nervous wreck over me not having hair and just knew I was dying. So for now, I'm not telling her. Thanks again ladies for holding me up in prayer. Today is a new day and I'm thankful I am here to see it. Enjoy the moment. Prayers and well wishes to all of you",

He thinks that some of the cancer has already figured out how to survive with Abraxane. So his plan was to keep taking Abraxane but to add Carboplatin. I will start that next week after insurance approves it. He is going to do 3 rounds, which is 9 weeks then rescan. I'm praying this works this time. Thank you all for the thoughts and prayers.

I seen him before I had my pelvis surgery and he was assisting the trauma surgeon for my surgery so he is very aware of my case. I like him, he is a very smart man. But like I said, I really don't think I'm physically well enough to undergo that surgery right now. My cancer is still on the run and I really feel like we should have it more controlled before having that. Plus all my energy is wiped out from chemo. It is really bad timing, just not sure I can do that right now. I also need to talk to my MO about it and get his opinion. I sure can't afford for treatment to have any delay right now.

We also discussed the hip replacement surgery, and to my surprise yesterday he agreed with me and said at this point he didn't think I should do it. Even though I wanted him to agree with me, the fact that he changed his mind gave me mixed emotions. Does he think I don't have much longer to live? He said he wanted me to be more stable before having it and I was no where close to that. So, for now, I'm not agreeing to that surgery. At least one thing to not worry about.

I did have the experience of being with my Dad during his final days. Hospice was involved. My experience was not a positive one. So maybe it has to do with location of services.",

I think as time goes by, you learn that since you can't change it you might as well make the best of it. With that said, trust me, we all have our ups and downs. I tell everyone that I am on an emotional roller coaster. Meds are great for helping to even you out. I worked in the medical field for 30 years, I don't think anyone is able to figure out what is fair as far as life and death. You just have to be thankful for the time you have. Best of luck to you.",

You have a child that needs you, a husband that loves you, along with other friends and family, they are all reasons to fight. I was also going through a difficult time, I was put on an antidepressant that has made a world of difference. There is purpose for us all. Find your strength in your family. They love and need you.
