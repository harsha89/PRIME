A great reminder of all that CAN be and SHOULD be good about going through this. Thanks for sharing. I'm doing ok today...it turns out I now have an upper resp infection...so I'm on a zpack - not too uncommon for me this time of year.  This too shall pass.  I'm treating myself to another spa day this weekend as part of my weekend pampering ritual. Joanne, I finished day 16 also today - light at the end of the tunnel. Sandra",

I'm done with the boosts - you may recall they switched up and did the boosts last week because I was red and peeling so much.  So what's next after it's all over??? I went through that emotional trip this weekend.  I know I have to take tamoxifen...but is that enough to keep it from coming back...argggh...I've got to get THAT off my mind. Joanne...good for you you're done...but I see you're having that recurrence fear also. You know, my treatments end Friday; but my follow up appointment with my medical oncologist until January...should I try to schedule sooner?...hmmmm. Brenda, glad to hear you're kicking the habit...what a great gift for yourself. Alright ladies...it's almost lights out time...but glad to see everyone is still checking in. Sandra",

I had my 13th treatment Friday...and my back is really sore this morning...on top of that I had a dental bridge to just come out over the weekend. So I\"m heading to the dentist....and actually staying home from work today. I\"ve worked every day since my treatment started...and actually went back to work 10 days after my lumectomy. But today, my body is telling me to stay home...so I am.  Layne should be enjoying Cancun by now. Can't wait to hear how she did...hopefully she's enjoying herself. Joanne like you by Thursday and Friday, I'm down for the count...and usually by Sunday I'm getting the energy back.  This weekend it was a little different...I had enough energy Saturday to treat myself to a spa day....facial and body moisturizing treatment...and Sunday I was more tired. I'm slowly learning how much energy to exert when. Have a great day everyone. Sandra",

When I returned for treatment yesterday...they decided to start my boosts this week and give the rest of the boob a break til next week. So...I'm in the single digits..8 more treatments to go .

Layne, I SO needed to hear you are on your way to Cancun.  Now I know my request is at least reasonable. Today, the rad therapist - the zapper (nice woman) also expressed a \"don't do it\" sentiment. I think she means well...but her line today was \"you don't want it to come back\".  Well, of course, I don't want it to come back...but according to my med onc - I'm in a very good position...I had non-invasive ductal carcinoma in situ Stage 0 - clear margins on the first surgery - no lymph involvement...My treatment is 33 rads followed by tamoxifen...wanting to take a break shouldn't be as stressful as this. So far the radiation treatments are going well...a little tenderness...quite a bit of fatigue...and the pinkness is starting to appear. Enjoy Cancun and take care of that cough! Sandra",
