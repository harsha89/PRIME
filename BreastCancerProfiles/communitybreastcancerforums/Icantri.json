I have 3 masses, 2 were seen on ultrasound after mammogram, the third was seen on ultrasound during biopsy procedure of the first two. 1 of the lesions was deemed benign and the other cancer. The third will likely be biopsied on 11/2 or soon after. I don't know why they didn't biopsy it with the other two. They are all 3 very close to one another. Does a multi focal cancer change anything with respect to Prognosis, treatment or likelihood of mets?",

I have learned so much just by reading articles here and your responses to others' questions. One thing I still don't understand, is that I read here that a mastectomy is no more likely to prevent metastasis than a lumpectomy. Is that for all stages? I am stage I and was hoping to have mastectomy and no radiation. My auxiliary nodes were checked by ultrasound and were clear. Is metastasis a concern if mastectomy is done before it has reached the lymph nodes? How is a mastectomy no more helpful than lumpectomy in preventing cancer from spreading? Or am I interpreting this backwards, and the statement is meaning that a lumpectomy is just as successful in preventing mets? 48 years old at diagnosis Dx 10/18/2016, IDC, Right, 1cm, Stage IA, Grade 1, 0/4 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Surgery 11/16/2016 Mastectomy: Right Hormonal Therapy 12/14/2016 Tamoxifen pills (Nolvadex, Apo-Tamox, Tamofen, Tamone) Log in to post a reply",

I breezed through the first two weeks noticing significant improvements very quickly and that has slowed up to where I don't know if it is normal or a problem. So you think this is normal tightness because of internal stitches? I understand about not wanting the scar tissue to stick to the skin. My tightness feels deeper so the internal stitches explanatmakes sense. I don't know why but feeling the bumpy parts gives me the creeps when I try massaging them. I am usually niot weirded out by stuff like this. I like the idea of the little massager. Thank you. I will try to be patient. At least until I am 6 weeks post op. :)",
