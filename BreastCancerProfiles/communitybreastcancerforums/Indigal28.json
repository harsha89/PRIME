Even though that was reassuring, the pain was a constant bother which was disturbing me from concentrating on my daily activities.The previous doctor told me that I am not due for a mammo bcos of my age and that over here mammos are done only when women are over 40 yrs old. In addition, the wait here for mammo can be months! But nevertheless I have taken the first step towards this worry to see a gynae on sat,9th oct. It's wed,6th oct over here now. Hope I get some good reassuring news from the doctor. Thank you ladies for your replies. I'll post what the Dr advises after sat. Hope it's only some muscle related or other issues and not BC!",

I'm from Asia and not sure if I am able to post anything here but thought would try. I'm a 34 year old single mom with 2 kids aged 4 and 7. Got divorced 2 years ago. I first experienced sharp stabbing pain in my left breast from the 2o'clock point to my nipple in Oct 2009. At first I thought it was cyclical due to pre menstrual syndrome. but even after my period it continued for about 2 months. The pain usually becomes more intense when I remove my bra and last for up to 30 seconds. It also comes along when I get up from bed or run or even when I get up from the sofa. I went to a doctor in my country and was refererred to a breast specialist. She checked and said she could not find any defined lumps but stated that I had dense and lumpy breast. she did a normal scan and could not find anything and gave me a date for a detailed ultrasound which was only in March 2010. I was dismissed with a few painkillers and went home. When March arrive, I forgot the appointment and did not attend the ultrasound. After that, life was stressful for me with the kids and coping with work stress as well,I did not pay any attn to my breast. There were on and off pain but it did not bother me much. Now since end August 2010, I've been having these pains again and this time round, they are more intense and there is also a burning sensation and sharp pains. 2 weeks ago, while showering, I was massaging my aching left breast and there was a watery white to slightly yellow coloured discharge from my left nipple. I squeezed my right breast and there was discharge from there as well. I could not find any lumps as I just feel confused when I do a self examination my whole breast feels lumpy.The pain is still on my left breast and at times at night when I turn in my sleep, the pain comes and I wake up from it. Even at work I do feel the ache and when I remove my bra, the pain is so intense sharp and burning.I have scheduled myseld to see a gynae this coming sat,9th October and I'm just worried. Apologise for being so long winded but I am hoping if anyone could help me if they had similar symptoms as me. The time right now in my country is 4p.m and I hope I'm not disturbing anyone of you out there. Indigal28. Log in to post a reply",

I forgot to mention earlier, I'm sorry that yo and M360 are diagnosed with BC. Hope things are better. My prayers and wishes are with you both for speedy recovery. I'm new to all this medical jargons but I fairly understand that both ofyou are diagnosed with IDC. Is that the most common kind of BC? How are both of you handling it? What were your symptoms like?",
