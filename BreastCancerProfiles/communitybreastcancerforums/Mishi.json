Was cancer free until this Dec. when I was dx with stage 1B triple negative breast cancer right in the site of my maximum radiation dose ( found on routine memmogran). Had bilateral mastectomies and am now undergoing 12 weekly treatment of taxol/carbo. Maxed out on adriamycin and RT already from previous treatment. It's difficult to resume the role of a cancer patient after 22 years of remission. And it is much harder to do when you're 51 instead of 28. Just finished my third treatment yesterday so 1/3 done!!
