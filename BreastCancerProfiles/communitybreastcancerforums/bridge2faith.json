I just had a Mammo yesterday AM and my breast specialist call me at 8am today to tell me that they found microcalcifications and she immediately scheduled for me to see her in 6 days for her to further evaluate, she stated don't worry, well why does she want to see me so soon and why did she call me in less than 24 hours after I got the Mammo when the Radiologist stated that if they found anything suspicious they would send me a certified letter in like a week. Hope someone can help me to understand if this is something to worry about and do they usual do biopsy. BC doesn't run in my family but my Mom passed early from other cancer. thank you and I hope all are being healed.Â  Log in to post a reply",
