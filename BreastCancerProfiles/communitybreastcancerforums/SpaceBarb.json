    "Content": "Aug 16, 2016 07:36PM - edited Oct 13, 2016 01:18PM by SpaceBarb I have experienced both the traditional breast radiation treatment 17 years ago and the new SAVI treatment recently. I chose SAVI this time because of the shorter duration and the targeted ability of this method. I have read some feedback suggesting the SAVI was not a big deal. I beg to differ. Any time you have a foreign object placed inside your body, it is a big deal. The treatment may be for 5 days, but I wore the appliance for 9 days. One day for placement, second day for configuration of it, living with it over the weekend where nothing is done and then the 5 days of actual radiation 2 times a day. The appliance is placed in the cavity created where the tumor is removed. Fluid goes to that area and I leaked this fluid for the entire 9 days plus a little after removal. I found the SAVI experience to be uncomfortable and at times painful. I went on a regimen of ibuprofen and the prescribed antibiotics (which ended up giving me a yeast infection). Now that it is over I can't say I am sorry to have done it, but it is a call. The old time radiation is now usually done for 3 weeks as opposed to the 6 weeks I experienced in the past. I experienced skin burn then and now (more in the past). I also experienced an accident where the table I was laying on while connected to the source was moved; quite painful and deeply distressing. Hopefully accidents of this nature are not common. I had a lot of support from friends and I am retired so did not have to deal with going to work. Removal of the SAVI was painful when the unit was being contracted in the breast not the actual removal through the entry wound which was well lathered with lidocaine cream. (Imagine pliers with the screw on the end combined with the head of an egg whisk). It may have been an issue for me because the SAVI was nearer to the skin. I am not yet fully recovered so I can't speak to any long term issues but I am hopeful that I will heal quickly and well. I should add that I experienced times of strange fatigue in the afternoons towards the end of the treatment and continuing now after the treatment. I don't consider myself a Breast Cancer Survivor but a Breast Cancer Treatment Survivor. Whatever method you choose or how you proceed, I think the more information you have to make the decision the better. Good luck! Follow up some 6 weeks later. The radiation burn I experienced was across the side of my breast not localized at the targeted spot which was on top of the breast. Also I no longer seem to have any hair growing under that armpit. I experienced this lack of armpit hair growth from the original radiation treatment I had some years ago on the other breast. At that time the beam crossed my armpit and hair above the beam still grows, below not. I shared this info with my radiation doctor and he had no answers for me. But it suggests that the radiation is not as localized as advertised. Also I was sent bills for the use of parts during radiation. The only part involved that I can think of was the SAVI appliance. I had been told that insurance would cover it all as radiation treatment. Evidently BC/BS broke out the billing into various sections. My insurance does cover \"parts\" so the bills have been resubmitted. But if someone does not have this type of coverage, they may get an unwelcome surprise. And lastly I shared all of this info with the SAVI website. I submitted it twice in case of any uploading error. They chose not to publish my story. As they have no direct competition, I wonder at their obvious attempt to show only glowing reports instead of a full unbiased account. If I had it to do over again, I'm not sure I would pick the SAVI method. It's a call.",
