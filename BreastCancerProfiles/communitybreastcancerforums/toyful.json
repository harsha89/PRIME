It definitely feels different than a swollen lymph node. Over the last 5 weeks it has grown fast and is now very visible, about the circumference of a quarter. Also, my breathing has become labored from just going up 1 flight of stairs. I am getting a petscan and catscan on January 13. I am quite confident that this is mets to the trachea. Please post what you found out from your pet scan.",

I am close to your age too and do not want to die.(45) My scans show new metastatic nodes in the ap window and lungs. My lungs have a large amount of fluid in them that is new and fluid around my heart. I was on Xeloda until today and now they are going to switch me to Navelbine. I have just got home and have not researched Navelbine yet, but my doctor says it has low side effects. I also have been on many hormonal and chemo therapies, which either don't work at all or only for a short time. I am also triple negative. Anyway, we have so much in common, maybe we can compare notes with our new phase of treatment!",

I was experiencing a lot of pain while I waited for chemo to begin, and the tea seemed to help a little bit with the pain. In 3/08, I started seeing a naturopath in addition to my oncologist, and the naturopath adamantly advised me to not take the tea. He said it would interfere with my chemo treatment. I stopped taking it at that time. Just to make this more confusing, I have been on 2 different chemo treatments and neither seems to be working much.",
