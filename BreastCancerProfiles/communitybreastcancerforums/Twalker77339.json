Now this past week had another ultrasound and they found several cyst on being 5cm. They told me nothing is wrong but my fear is 2of my sisters where diagnosed at the same time one 39 and the other at the time was 45. Now my sister that was the youngest is deceased befor 50 from cancer and my sister that was 45 had to have a double mastectomy. Someone please tell me why my doctors will not do a biopsy just to be sure even though I have had the genetics testing done it is still a scary concern. Log in to post a reply",
