Got my wigs ( I picked a short one for around the house and one outside) hahahah I thought why not live alittle-- will be cutting my hair Jan 2nd or so. Wish that I could sleep all this tension building for the 1st treatment is killing me.I had breast cancer before in my other breast and this is totally different other then the lumpectumy, my nodes were clean, didn't have the port nor the herceptin. But that was 12 years ago..now I am going thru this all again and it is getting worse 1st time tumor 1 inch this time 1 inch 1/2 more aggressive. just don't know what to expect with the chemo, I barely took the drugs last time,,",
