In other words-it's not a waste of time/money? Another random question as my wheels are turning thinking back over the past few months...when I did my mammogram 6 months ago they called me back to the imaging room 5 times to get \"clearer images\". Oddly enough at the time it didn't strike me as odd or nerve wracking. Only now am I thinking about that. Is that normal?? Or is it usually one and done image if all is \"normal\"? Sorry I know I am being over dramatic--Monday can't get here fast enough! I guess the big thing is I wasn't having anyone there with me. Should I? ",

      "Content": "LeeCope15 wrote: Hi there - Confessed stalker over the past week and have already learned so much from so many of you brave women (and men). I am scheduled for an Ultrasound on Monday and feeling concerned that I've made a mistake. A little back story - I am 37 with no previous issues. My mom is a two time survivor first diagnosed at 50 with a reoccurrence at 72. I also have dense breasts. At my last mammogram they recommended a 6 month surveillance alternating between mammogram and MRI. MRI was scheduled for January 2015, however insurance denied it. Because I haven't had an issues, they offered the ultrasound and I said I was fine with that given I haven't had any issues. However (and I promise I am NOT a hypochondriac!) some strange things have been happening: -I have lost 15lbs since October without trying or needing to. I know sounds like a good problem to have, but I small framed and it is more than I am comfortable with (and definitely has changed the size/shape of my breasts) -I have had nipple discharge since before my last mammogram but green/yellow and sticky. They did a prolactin test and all is fine. I assume nothing, but thought I should mention. -I have no breast pain but rather a frequent sensation of milk letting down like when I used to nurse. This is new over the past few months. So, I guess my big question before is Monday is if anything was wrong, would the Ultrasound be enough? I am wondering if I should have pushed insurance for that MRI. Any thoughts? Or, any questions I need to be prepared to ask? Thanks in andvance for all your wisdom! Log in to post a reply",
