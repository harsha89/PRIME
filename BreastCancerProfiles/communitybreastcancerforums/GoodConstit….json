I'm glad you're surgery is over and you had a chance to have some indication with the frozen section. My surgeon said there was no indication for me that a sentinole node needed to be checked?

What I conclude is that it's not all about margins but also grade of DCIS and other histology. I read some support for my surgeon's suggestion for a better than .5mm margin and even more that suggests it MAY not be helpful. I also learned that margins are more predictable for invasive breast cancer because DCIS skips around. I don't know how you found all that but THANK YOU! It was interesting! Still dazed and confused!

I'm not sure a mastectomy is cosmetically acceptable to me either if we are just talking about cosmetic outcome with the same survival rate, especially considering the recovery of a mastectomy. This is an excerpt from the Cancer World Report: In cases of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), however, a minimum clear margin of 2 mm is recommended, particularly with low- and interme- diate-grade lesions, because DCIS may grow discontinuously within the ducts. I Anterior and posterior margins of less than 2 mm are not of concern if there is no residual breast tissue. I All suspicious microcalcifications associated with the DCIS should be removed surgically. http://www.cancerworld.org/pdf/9184_pagina_12-16_Cutting_Edge.pdf",

      "Content": "Sep 13, 2015 11:19PM - edited Sep 13, 2015 11:25PM by GoodConstitution Hi, I read and worried endlessly about every detail of radiation treatment. I finished the three week Canadian protocol a week ago in the Seattle area and it went smoothly.  I found the enormous equipment and what it does very scary and helpful at the same time. I used aloe Vera and AquaFor as suggested and have a slight  itchy rash around my breast. It's all been easily tolerable. I soaked with domeboro for the itchiness and used some cortisone creme. I read about taking Ibuprophen just before treatment so I did that and think it helped. At least I had little to no pain and wore my usual bras (underwire) the whole time...just lined the cup with a piece of old cotton t shirt for protection. A size 34 B so one old t shirt made many cup liners. If you can live without an underwire I can see that  being much comfortable. I needed more shape for work. I experienced little fatigue and what I did experience was due to getting up early before work for treatment not so much the radiation. I worked more than my full schedule for those three weeks.  The worst of it was what my mind was doing so I can see where yoga and meditation would be powerful medicine as well.  I wish you all well!",
