      "Content": "bellagina wrote: Hi Everyone, Well, I up front apologize if it offends anyone that I am worried about hair loss but here goes.  Since my Mets diagnosis last DEC 2006, I first took Xeloda for 8 months which caused hair thinning and hand/foot syndrome even after reducing the dose a couple of times.  With the higher doses of Xeloda, I had no progression, but with the lowest dose (4 pills a day instead of 8), pleural and liver progression began and I switched to Arimidex.  I will not find out if Arimidex is working until Nov 20th as we are waiting 3 months to see my response - I have my first CT since Arimidex on Saturday Nov 10th.  Of course, I have \"Scanxiety\" and my OCN prescribes for me an Anti-Anxiety pill (just one!) to take before the CT as that is the only way I am able to drink the contrast cocktail.  I wish I'd asked for one to hear the results. My question is if we find out Arimidex is not working, what medications have you all taken that do not cause hair loss?  My ONC has told me that there are many and I know there are hormonals to try after Arimidex if it is not working.  What about other chemos that do not cause hair loss? Xeloda was not all that bad when it was working side effects included though I hated hand/foot and hair thinning but my ONC did not think going back to the higher dose of Xeloda was the best choice - it also made me extremely tired.  I'd want to try it again over something worse though. Am I making sense here?  Any responses are welcome.  Even though, inside I'm really an emotional wreck many times, I am at this point happy not to look sick on the outside.  In 1997 when first diagnosed I did the entire, lumpectomy, Adriamycin/Cytoxin, Tamoxifen route so I know what its like to be bald; back then though I had every reason to believe this would be a temporary thing. Thanks for listening, Love, Bellagina    Log in to post a reply",
