I'm sorry a lot of you have techs from hell!  My two techs are wonderful, we laugh and joke.  On Veteran's Day they were so slack they brought me over to the console and showed me what they did each time I came in and how they could tell where they needed to radiate.  It was toooo cool!  One of my pictures showed dark areas in my lungs, I pankicked for a momement until they told me the main picture was from my CAT Scan and the dark areas were actually the air in my lungs.  Each day they take the new x-rays they make and overlay them on the CAT Scan picture to make sure they radiate the correct area.  So for those who were wondering why they take x-rays each day, this is why.",
