He said the problem is he doesn't always know what condition the skin pocket is in when the BS finishes the MX part, and PS can't control the size and shape of the already emptied pocket. By starting with TEs and then having final implant put in later, he can manage the pocket better. Good thing is that PS says with pre-pectoral implants he can go ahead and start off with about 300cc in TE at time of MX, decreasing the number of fills needed later on, therefore decreasing the time needed to complete fills.",

It's based partly on your own healing ability (they won't do nipple sparring if you are a smoker). My BS said in my case it would only be 1 - 5% chance. I am starting to take extra Vit.

Don't know why drs. didn't share that information, but when I mentioned it to them they both said that was a good idea (zinc important also). My dr.s have said my surgery should be 4-5 hours. I have smaller breasts so I guess it won't take as long to remove all the tissue compared to those women with larger volume to remove. I'm lucky in that I don't have to have any lymph nodes checked or removed, so that will save time too.  ",

Who knew there were so many appropriate songs for us surgery ladies! Start with (for the night before surgery) \u201cI Couldn\u2019t Sleep At All Last Night\u201d, then (for anesthesia) \u201cCome Fly With Me\u201d and \u201cFly Me To The Moon\u201d.

My prophylactic NSBMX on 11/12 went great, nipples good, tissue expanders annoying but not painful anymore, fills have gone fine, and exchange surgery scheduled for Feb. 8. I thought I was doing great emotionally too - feeling very blessed and relieved I was able to have MX before my atypical biopsies became cancer. When I met with After Breast Cancer advisor last week, I broke down. She was talking about the group exercise classes I can start in a week or so, and I asked her if other women in there would be annoyed or resent me for being part of this program even though I didn't have breast cancer, and that I didn't want them to feel bad that they got cancer and I didn't. That's when I started crying. She explained that just because I didn't have cancer didn't mean I wasn't allowed to be part of the group, because I had gone through the scare of cancer, and had mastectomy, like the other women who will be in the group. She then said that many women, about 6-7 weeks out from surgery start to feel emotional, sad, depressed, because we are past the intensity of the build up to surgery. She also said I might have \"survivor's guilt\" because I didn't have cancer, when these other women did. Also, in 2018 I had other health issues pop up - shoulder surgery, cataract surgery, lumpectomy, etc., that all randomly happened in this same year. She suggested I meet with a counselor to help cope with these things. Again, I thought I was doing well until she started discussing these things (she's a cancer survivor), but now I do feel a little depressed. I also am realizing I have probably worn out my friends with my continued discussions of how I am/what I've gone through. I guess we have all been so used to going from one dr. appt. to another, and suddenly we are on our own more now. In preparing for this whole process I spent hours researching what to expect and to better be prepared, but now I'm done with most everything except exchange surgery.",

He also made the point that you really need to limit your arm movements (raising high, pulling, pushing, including when you stand up) as the TE is somewhat tear drop shaped, and even though he uses a few stitches to hold the corner tabs of the TE in place, you don't want movement through the chest to loosen that TE so that it moves around. I'm having nipple sparing pre-pectoral, and I asked at what point you can feel safe about no nipple necrosis, and he said that by one week out you'll be pretty safe. He said it happens pretty quickly so to keep an eye on it every day. Sound like he sends me home with no dressings - just steri-strips across the incision (interior stitches).

Certain movements feel like someone just stuck a spear deep in my side and that pain echos for a minute or so then goes away. I was told not to be doing any arm exercises, just t-rex movements, but i have better range of motion than that without any pain. It was a challenge to reach to wipe after using bathroom for first couple of days but that's better now. Two drains on each side, one of which on each side is barely draining enough to even count (1-2cc twice/day) and the other larger drains are doing 25 - 30 twice per day now. I have follow up with PS next Wed. so I'm sure at least one drain from each side will come out and maybe the other two also, as liquid is not as bright red anymore either. Got bowels moving good today, between taking colace and a bottle of citrus mag and no rx pain med today. Appetite is good and I spend most all day sitting upright (chair, computer) and several naps a day in recliner, where I also still sleep at night. Husband washed my hair in sink today so that felt good (not allowed to shower until all drains out) and am able to do decent job of sponge bath. I have two 6\" ace bandages around (not overly tight) chest, and although they didn't really explain why, based on the way she wrapped me, with most of it on top half of breast, I think it is for compression to help keep swelling down. I definitely feel swelling on top half of breasts, but I'm not seeing any bruising yet. Nipples look good (incisions are around top half of areola and lateral out to side) and have glue, not steristrips.

(9 days after surgery) although in my case it wasn't painless. I could feel the nurse pulling at the stitches on each side that hold the drains in place to cut them, and she told me to take a deep breath in and out twice. On the second breath out she yanked both of them on that side out. Yeow! Then did the same on the other side, and it hurt a little worse even. Pain was right at the drain incision site, so I don't know if it was because a scab had formed there, or I just wasn't as numb in that area as some women who claim no pain are. It was very tender for a couple of days and had a little oozing but seems to be much better today. Great news was yesterday I got to take my first full shower! Yippee! I've been sleeping in a recliner since surgery, so I thought last night, because I no longer had drains in, that I would try to sleep in bed. Only made it for about 15-20 minutes. I felt like the saline in the TEs was spreading out in a different pattern than when I am upright, and it was very uncomfortable. Also felt like extra stretching tension across chest and into arm pits, although I also may have over done some reaching into cabinets yesterday. At any rate, it was back to recliner. This is actually the first day I haven't felt the need to take a nap. I haven't taken any pain rx since day 5, but I still sometimes feel a little weak or light headed. I suppose that is partly from blood loss during surgery, general trauma to the body, and the fact I have hardly been doing anything for 11 days. PS put in 250 cc on each side at time of MX (estimating me to go to about 500 cc). I'm hoping when I get my first fill this coming Wednesday that that will ease some of the TE pain, going with the theory that the implants are still semi folded with lumps and creases, so more fill will fill in those creases. I tried to take it easier today and pain isn't as strong unless I touch the skin. I do have a little \"scabbing\" on parts of each nipple/areola but PS said that is not unusual with my type of incisions (around top half of areola and out to side 3-4\"), and that I might loose a little color to that area once scabs fall off. Hope healing continues for all of us post surgery ladies, and prayers for each of you ladies having surgery this next week. I does really feel good to have it behind you, even though it takes awhile to heal and fully recover.",

I was too antsy to be able to sit around, so I got on pinterest and started looking at projects related to mastectomies, and I have started sewing those under arm pillows for after surgery, seat belt cover cushions, and some drain bag holders. I am going to donate them locally for those patients who could use them (through nurse navigator, doctor's office, etc.) Even doing some sort of project around the house helps keep you busy. Mustlovepoodles is right - keep yourself physically busy. I also listen to contemporary Christian music on the radio in the car and at home.",

That area is now a little paler than the rest of areola and may or may not ever regain it\u2019s original color. The others nipple got a thin scab on it but that flaked off and is fine. I read that there may be some seepage at nipple and areola after surgery as a normal reaction to the surgery as the body deals with the trauma. Check with you PS to be sure.",

      "Content": "Sep 5, 2018 01:41PM - edited Sep 7, 2018 10:54AM by Moderators I had a wire guided lumpectomy in March (no dye though). I thought the whole wire thing would be really weird too but it wasn't any big deal. They took me in for mammogram a couple of hours before procedure, squeezing breast horizontally, then releasing and going vertically - the purpose to see where they should insert the wire to have the most direct access to the area to be excised. While the breast is squeezed in the mammogram, the radiologist inserted the wire into the breast. The \"wire\" is so thin you don't even feel it (I think they may have numbed me up just a little in that area). The wire is like a thin plastic wire, and once it was in place (they confirm by doing another mammogram), there is a little barb on the end, like a tiny fish hook, that holds it in place, and they then looped up the rest of the thin wire and taped it down on my skin nearby. There are also some youtube videos you can see of putting in wire. I put my shirt back on (no bra) and waited to be called for pre-op then. I was so fascinated about it I had to take a picture (see below). Surgery for me was about 1 hour, then 90\" or so in pre-op and then home. I only needed pain rx for that evening and once the next morning. I did keep icing it and that kept bruising down (I also ate a lot of fresh pineapple for a few days ahead of time to reduce bruising). I did eventually end up with a seroma in that area, but heat and very gentle massage helped with that, although it took several months to finally fully clear up. All in all, not too bad and my scar has almost disappeared (6 month post surgery picture below also). Sorry the pix are so big but can't figure out how to make them smaller.       ",
