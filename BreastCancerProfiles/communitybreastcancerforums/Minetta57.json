As member mentioned above, there is much stuff out there that makes one nervous so I\u2019m not reading that. Today, had my PET scan and echocardiogram. I\u2019m also starting to watch my diet by adding more fruits and veggies and eating less sugar. Although, I have lost a few pounds after this dx. Good luck to you and me.",

I was called back to my Imaging Center for spot compression views and left breast ultrasound for a nodular density. However, the radiologist on 4/2, found a spiculated mass. She told me it must come out. I see the surgeon on Monday 4/9/18 for consultation. I hope she will do the biopsy any day soon after the consult. I asked the radiologist, what about the nodular density the first radiologist had seen? She said that may be a satellite lesion, and that they want to do an MRI after the biopsy of the spiculated mass and we can see everything after the MRI. I\u2019m very nervous and hanging in there. Jjust moved to Florida in the Fall. Recently lived in CT my whole life. I\u2019m 56. In 1999, had a benign lesion removed in CT. I had a benign microcalcification around 2006. Had mammo every year for the past 15 years in Connecticut. I read few stories here and I wish you all the best. Now, waiting is hard but I\u2019ll keep busy with things. Will talk to you all soon. Sorry I\u2019m longwinded. But I feel better after writing this. Take good care.",

I hope things work out well for you. I\u2019m trying not to worry. These days there is so much more that can be done. I\u2019m in my mid 50s also. They also plan on an MRI for me as well. Stay on top of things is important.",
