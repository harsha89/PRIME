I think it is where they took out the tumor.  I mentioned it to my oncologist because I am not seeing the radiation therapist.  He acted like he thought I was crazy.  He said he had never heard that one.  The funny thing is that I had a gastric bypass in 2002.  Sometimes I have itching in my scar area.  I really think it has something to do with scar tissue OR, I have wondered if the itching in the breast may be related to the little pieces of metal that they put in there to mark where the tumor was.  Don't really know . . . just speculating.",
