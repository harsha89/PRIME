I believe they said fibroid. since then i have had another lump slowly grown near where other lump was but more on side of breast near underarm. I had an ultrasound 4 months ago and they said everything looks fine but to watch for sudden growth or more lumps i believe. I was wonderig if it is normal for fibroids to leave one breast always more tender and cause sharp pains near underarm(side of breast area). Also can fibroids effect the nipple and make them feel more tender/painful or effect nipple shape? I have these symptoms in my left breast (i recently began havin pain in both breasts before/during periods) but the tenderness/pain in the left has been constant and seems more frequent? If i accidententaly bump my breast or nipple it is quite painful and i have stopped wearing bras because i wonder if the pressure was causing disomfort. Is this what fibrocystic breats is like? Or do other peoples fibroids bother them often? Log in to post a reply",
