I hope you don't mind me posting on here :) I was originally going to start chemo on the 24th Oct however I got gastro that was going around (blah) so onc postponed it. I am a Hodgkin's Lymphoma survivor from back in 1996 so my BC is caused by my mantle radiation I had back in the day!! My onc made several phone calls to USA and UK re which chemo would work on me due to my prior chemo history! They decided Taxatere x 3 cycles and CMF x 3 cycles....no re radiation. I will however have a Masectomy next year and probably will do both boobies...... surgeon only recommends one at this stage.....! Well i'm feeling fine day 2 of Taxatere...think its because of the steroids i'm on...... I'm off for my shot tomorrow to boost up White Blood Count (WBC) so looking forward to that..!! I did meet a few other ladies that had or are going through chemo now in the chemo room yesterday and they are doing so well.....a lot older than me which makes it even better seeing them go through it seeing that there is a light at the end of that chemo tunnel..... Take care ladies......",

It is a gradual self tanning lotion. I ended up using this as I have lots of times in the passed and liked the colour as you manage it with the applications you apply.  I did not react to the ingredients in that whilst on chemo.",

I know you mentioned your moms family doesn't live close by, however do you have a family member that you can phone to speak to ? or perhaps a councillor at school to talk to? It isn't good to bottle things up like this. You really do need to speak to somebody about what you are going through. We are here for you on this board but really think you do need to speak with someone on the phone or face to face. Sometimes hospitals have programs for caregivers. Perhaps if you go with your mom when she has chemotherapy next you could ask one of the nurses if there is a program there. Chemo and radiation will be hard on your mom, does she have anyone else that will be helping her out? You sound like a very helpful girl to your mom and she is lucky to have you around to help her out. As for your friends, you know, we all go through it. Sometimes people just don't know how to act , or what to say around you incase they say the wrong things. It's not fair that they don't call but unfortunately people handle situations differently. Don't be offended, it's their way of coping I guess. Good Luck honey, feel free to PM me if you need to chat.",

I've just read through majority of these posts as I too am a Hodgkin's Disease survivor! First diagnosed in 1996 on my 18th Birthday with Hodgkin's Disease Stage 3.... I started on ABVD and relapsed 3 months later,   had some other chemo (not sure of name) along with stem cell transplant. Along with Mantle Radiation 39gy not sure how many times . I'm now 34 and have a gorgeous little boy who will be 3 on Christmas Day! I self felt a lump in right breast in August and thought nothing of it....was concerned but knew my Mammo was coming up in 3 weeks time so plodded along as usual feeling fine and dandy..no other symptoms or anything so thought nothing of it! My mammo showed a little lump, so was rushed from a mammo to an ultrasound which was scheduled anyway for my thyroid nodules!!  I had a biopsy on both Thyroid and breast 1 week later to be told nodules were benign, thank god and breast was malignant! I opted for a lumpectomy a week later and sentinal lymph node removal at the same time. 2/2 nodes came back positive so I had to have an axillary lymph removal which was last Thursday. IDC 16mm Grade 3 (CT / BONE scan came back all good) except for a small lung nodule which I've been told was scar tissue from radiation all those years ago. (never previously had a ct scan so not sure how long its been there for)   Results back in that the remaining 8 they took out were negative (thank goodness). Found out that these were taken out as the radiologist wanted to re-radiate if C was found in other nodes!! Now Onc appt tomorrow .. knowing I need to go through chemo again is draining me and mentally I'm preparing myself for it.... I know i got by when i was 18 even though its 'blocked' out of my mind....I know previously I use to have chemo every 2 weeks and managed to still go out clubbing with my 'gorgeous wig' back then and I know now that I still need to go out and enjoy life with my little man but can't help feel down...I have a supportive family, husband and my little boy knows somethings wrong with mummy (as I break into tears and he tells me 'don't cry mummy') and its hard when I look at him I burst out crying thinking the worst...but seeing your stories has made me think I NEED to think POSITIVE THOUGHTS I NEED to live to see my munchkin go to his first day of school, graduate, marry etc I WILL SURVIVE.!!!!!!! Just a question though, is there anyone that was diagnosed with BC, see a fertility specialist? and if so, (and perhaps you can inbox me if you prefer) with outcome of what you did or didn't decide to do.....I'm in two states of mind at the moment. Do I opt for another playmate for my son or do I stop knowing that I have a happy and healthy son now and to be happy with what god has already given me considering !!  ??? Thanks",

ABVD --  1996 last cycle  I had relapsed so apparently we can only have the A part once depending on how much we had back 'in the day' I apparently had half the amount so I can still have half now....... I had something starting with Cyclo^^^^ that was provided prior to my stem cell transplant and then agressive chemo to follow that... with radiation after. He said I don't really need chemo now but as a 'precaution' as I'm a Grade 3 and will also have a masectomy after chemo! Can anyone tell me exactly what chemo was given to you previously for Hodgkin's and what was given for BC. My head is in a spin about this!! I am doing a heart monitoring test on Wednesday and see a fertility specialist on Tuesday to consider my options for later on down the track! Any input would be great Thanks Traii",

My cousin came over today with her son whos 1.5 years old....DS had a good time with him today :) We had lunch, then walked to the park, kids played and hey, so did us mums......it was so much fun going on the slide again and swinging on the swings.....(ok ladies, don't laugh!) I'm a big kid at heart !! and you did mention to stay active while waiting for surgery date.....lol Alive, bet you feel better getting the results today and getting a plan going soon. Did they mention BMX soon. Doubt you will have a stage / grade yet until you have surgery to determine treatment options. So glad you came back here to let us know how you were doing and the outcome. Is the MRI a full body one ? After my biopsy, I had scans of the bones and chest.  I didn't have any nausea prior to my DX so hopefully your nausea is just because you have been so stressed out lately with everything going!! Maria, so true girl, never a dull moment with the C but you know what, when it's all over , the surgery, chemo etc, you will be much more please when the hospital visits come to a sudden halt...actually you miss them for that extra bit of peace of mind......instead I'm loosing my mind with every thing I feel at times.....and I don't want to be calling my onc because he will soon think I'm a hypocondriac...lol. Good luck with PS appt and your scans and testings..fun times....stay positive girl.....x Nihahi, hows those peas going  ? Hope you haven't had to get them out again and you are on the mend. Carlads, hope the mouth thing is easing , blah, don't miss that one bit ! Liefie, thanks for sending the sun !! Caitlin, is it your last one this week ? Websister, OMG, just LOVE the new avatar you gorgeous sister. My hair is about your length, if not a little longer. I left my wig off today when my cousin came over whom happens to also be my hairdresser, she looooved it.....she loved my new colour. She thinks the 'pixie' look suits...however I'm just not yet ready to face the 'world' with it yet. I guess I've never been a short haired girl, nor a girl that liked her hair up...my avatar I got lots of complements at my brothers wedding with my hair up because no one really use to see me with it up.....who knows, i may just like leaving it this length...I'm loving the towel drying it and no straightener or blow wave...lol. You look adorable. Sorry to hear you have a sore lower back, did you excercise or pick something up in the wrong way ? I've got a swallon lymph node I think on the opposite side to where my nodes were taken out and a saw jaw accompanied with mild head aches every now and then... its seems like a 'tension' headache....still got this sinus thing happening so I'm off to see my GP tomorrow. Hope nothing serious! Edi, your pics are gorgeous. You and DH are such a cute couple. So glad you enjoyed your chinese food. I couldn't remember that soup that you or someone here recommended so I didn't order soup last night ? Hope all you girls are enjoying your evening / morning / arvo / sleep. Well, I'm off to wake DS up from his mid arvo nap its 3:45pm here .... play time again !!",

Now he is watching the DVDs he chose while mummy has a break!! Then I think I'm going to make some banana and sultana bread. ( got the recipe off the back of the sultana pack so hope its nice, sounds ok)! lol. Movie, no researching of the Tim Tams.....by the case, no don't do it...LOL. I've resisted the temptation today of buying a packet whilst down at the grocery store. !! Good night my sweethearts.....sleep well for those of you going off to bed soon. Its 3:30pm here....still plenty of time for play here! xx ",

Then, having dinner I felt my top wet, I was weeping on the other drain site, so my mum had to change the dressings . Its a little red so who knows, perhaps they will take them out tomorrow though I would rather them stay in if they have too, yes a pain as they are, but I had a seroma the size of a large orange under my arm when they removed my lymph nodes. I think the drain came out a little early.! Your cousin is in my thoughts. A year older than me! Can't be easy with 2 kids because I know it's not with my one! I miss my little mans cuddles at night time and again waking me up in the morning. Can't wait to have him back home with us. Its just too quiet and my house is STILL clean after 2 weeks !!! Movie, good luck with that root canal. I hope DD surgery goes well and insurance probs sorted. Edi, hope your car is back up and running for you.

Taste is absolutely doing my head in..apart from that, Im feeling fine....even did house work while my little munchkin watched Fireman Sam for the 100th time! lol...... How cute your GD thinks you have a sore arm 'only'...my son thinks I only have a yucky booby and with the medicine everything will be better soon ( hmm....in a few months time maybe.....positive thinking). True though ladies, once you have the first chemo treatment your mind will start to ease thereafter as its the unknowing that adds the stress of SE's.....just don't go 'looking' for all the SE's because trust me.....thats bound to drive any of us loopy. Today Day 5 from Taxotere and I don't feel any different to that of day 1-4. Yes I'm a little tired but still getting things done in my own pace (and in a little fast forward thanks to my lovely son lol) CBEAR: You need to eat....I was like you, thinking omg, was it something I'm eating thats caused my BC but its not just about that. I actually gained 1kg every week !! :( Don't be afraid of eating, even my Breast Surgeon said to carry on as normal like everything, 'in moderation' ! I had a MRI after my Mammogram, Biopsy, ultrasound and Lumpectomy also... this is something I wanted to get done as it can show more of the breast area and Lymph Nodes also. My tumour was at 6o'clock right breast and cm. Then as I had positive nodes went in for a Full Bone scan, chest, body, heart etc. Treatment plans are all different hun..... I have to have chemo as I've already been radiated on for a previous cancer , it really does depend on each surgeon, type of cancer / agressiveness / stage etc. Your tumor is small, did they say lumpectomy with sentinal removal to check if your lymph nodes are clear ? Being ER++ and HER2- is good....it means that the cancer responds well to hormone treatment. I have told that delaying even a month will not make a difference as most BC's have been there years before they show up on any test. Good Luck and keep us posted. We are all here to help in any way and I hope that I've eased your mind a little ! Tracey",

Whoo hoo, 7 days like me and not too bad SE's ( just bone pain today oh and how can we forget that fluffy tongue I can't say boredom with my son around, whats boredom...lol) Enjoy your little venture out today Edi...... go get those magazines and have yourself a cuppa (and a bicky) and curl up on the couch....ahhhh......take care Traii",

Carla, sorry to hear that you have IDC.....like Bearcub mentioned, once you have surgery & pathology reports back this will help determine actual size,grade, stage, ER & HER2 stat, etc and then you can move on with the next plan of attack with you onc.  Good Luck,  these ladies have been nothing but a big help to me so you have definetely come to the right place. It does get easier to accept with time...its the first month that took its toll on me , the unknowing, but you have your surgery booked in soon so at least thats all organised. Dakota, whoo hoo, 1st treatment is always the worst ...now I've had the 1st one, bring on the next 5 for me I say....bring it on so we can all kick this C in the butt !!  Oh & speaking of 'butt' I can't help much with the no pooping dept , mines been quite the 'constant flow' so to speak ( ahh love the things we talk about here :) lol) Well its Friday arvo here, Day 10 - feeling on top of the world and full of energy, My DS is staying over my parents house tonight and  DH and I are heading into town for dinner. Take care everyone and hope you all have a wonderful day filled with positive vibes, energy and NO SE's (or very minimal ones)",

My Surgeon said, lumpectomy, axillary disection ( I had 2 nodes positive out of the 10 they took out) so I'm having a masectomy after chemo ( no radiation as I've already been radiated on) and to be honest, chemo is 'better' out of chemo and radiation !

Dakota, hairs shedding, started a tiny bit day 13 now its a little more but not noticable YET I just don't let my son give me great big hugs with his arms pulling at my hair.....would be devestated if a chunk comes out in his hands! My husband says I'm malting just like his mums dog does..(umm well thanks hunni for the comparison to a bloody dog ) ..... such a DH ( oh thats darling husband not D&*! Head ladies ) Edi , YOU are an inspiration !!! Oh , I use to tug a little too, then I tugged and oh boy did I tug and hair in my hands......so don't go tugging too much....lol It's good you cut your hair short, I left mine shoulder length..... yes, my mums a darl...she said \"oh don't be crazy, your hair won't fly off in the wind\"!! I replied \"ummm hellloooo I'm not taking that chance darling mother, just please drop me off at the front\" !! Second session next Wednesday for me (which is your Tuesday really) hope that you and I can keep up the not too bad SE's too.....my onc said they will be same as last cycle but hoping that icing will get rid of the blah blah tongue thing I had going on for a few days......and hope that the loo loo thing doesn't go on....pity I didn't loose weight...felt like I dropped a few kilos though but the scales yesterday didn't say that!! I think they were lying really !!! Oh too funny Edi, at least that will give your hubby something to do......brighten up your loo!!.... Hopefully you don't spend too much of your time in there next week !! Maybe you can take paper and pen in there and write away for your book :) Bearcub, CONGRATS, you finished chemo, so good to hear and hope you are feeling well :) Grow that hair I say...and hope it grows super fast for you :) Benny, Love love love your wig, its gorgeous and will really suit you, its just like your hair now by the looks of your profile pic..... I bought my wig for a quarter of the price that they sell human hair wigs here in Australia, I purchased it from a website in China and I had it delivered in under 2 weeks so was really happy with that. I got it coloured and styled just like my own....I'll try uploading a photo  I am in love with your giant plush toy, and so glad to hear you have a little plush toy to keep you company during your treatment.....:) I went to a LGFB class when I had Hodgkin's it was really really good... I didnt go this time around...they actually made me show them how to apply make up because they asked what I was doing there (in a nice way) because I didn't need help with mine...but its good to go to I encourage you all....you get free products too ... bonus :) Have a wonderful day ladies and hope you all have a SE free day :) I'd better go to bed as my son loves garbage trucks and tomorrow is garbage collection day so he'll be up at the crack of dawn at the window checking out the bloody bin truck ahhh gotta love toddlers :)",

(well that's what i was going to go with if anyone asked) so my reply yep.... you like, shes like I love the cut, colour everything you look great and younger..( umm well I didn't want to look younger but I'm happy to look 21 again) .. lol Didnt your onc prescribe that shot that boosts your WBC Edi ?? I get that 24 hours after chemo. I'm feeling sooooo much better than the first cycle of Taxotere..... I'm handling much better. except for this hair no one would know..then again no one does with the wig :) 1 more taxotere 12th Dec (providing all goes well) then 3 x CMF's and I'll be done by end Feb.... 6th March all up as teh C part of CMF is oral...anyone else having or had this treatment ? Its an older one but can't have the E of the FEC as I've already had that before and I don't want to have complications with heart for gods sake! Liefie, I love how you come here and give us hope and wise thoughts...KILL KILL KILL it is ..... Taxotere not pretty but so long as it's working I don't give a damn....side effects are side effects, just need to deal with them then they are gone...and we can all get back on with life like you :) take care all....... sitting here with the air conditioner on watching Fireman Sam with my little munchkin while his daddy has been called out to work xx",

Its normal to feel good one day then feel weak the next especially if youve done more than what youve been doing the days prior. Just remember you had a good 5hrs with Diamond , lets aim for a couple of hours tomorrow (weather permitting) Im so sorry you have had a rougher time with your first treatment. My advice would be not to read statistics and stories...Ive done my share of reading about my prior cancer and a new cancer etc etc and then I look at my son and say Im going to get through treatment, beat this bitch of a thing and come out ofthis even stronger than I was before! You too will be a stronger women.....you are strong now and you need to remain strong Benny. We all have faith in you...you will get through this with all our support, we are here for you.

My first Taxotere I thought I was going to give up...but then had this sudden thought I can't give up, i have things to live for, people to live for, my hubby to grow old with, my son to watch him grow up to be the the big man. I know you've had it tough Benny, tought then most of us but you need to do this for yourself.

Thank goodness for the ice my aunty brought and I took, for my feet...they worked like magic...now to see minimal tingling and hope i can walk. My onc told me that I can have wine..whoo hoo...he said I'll be a 'one pot cheap shout screamer' as all it will take is one glass to get me over my limit....lol..... lets see on Saturday about that one...and here I am mean't to be the designated driver ..... guess hubby will be driving then I'm looking forward to a white wine....my chemo nurse was a darling today, they were soooo busy waited 2and a half hours extra for a seat today..they ended up putting me in the 'trial' room where people were undergoing trials for new things.....I didn't care where I was placed so long as it was on a seat with my IV.... I'm doing ok, little tired but think that could be the 4 hours sleep I had and the 36 degree day we had and going to be a hot hot night so i'm sitting in the lounge feet up with my air con on while the boys play outside...ahhh me time ;) another hot one tomorrow so pool party at my auntys... oh and the tingly feet, plenty of moisturiser...every hour onc said. Yeh easy for him to say, I can't wear socks on hot days like this with moisturiser so I'm chillaxing with my feet up as mentioned with moisturiser on.....lathering up those feet. hope everyone is well...Benny please cheer up, perhaps don't settle for second best...you need to find other options if this second chemo doesn't work, but with the Neulasta shot, which works wonders I'm sure you'll be alot better.....we'll see the difference with Edi again next week :)",

I know its the 'coming down' of the steriods....its HORRIBLE. Even my wig that I get compliments over just 'didn't feel right' ... are we allowed to sook and say ' why me' even though we were the 'chosen' ones to go through this stuff ..... who knows.....we are all on the same mission yet yesterday I felt like I had lost self control. I'm usually IN control and I think thats what really knocked me back.

Benny Benny, glad you sound much better, see positive thoughts, positive vibes, you are getting through this, you will conquer chemo even if you take that 'whip' out and 'whip its ass!\" Carlads, you sound good hun keep it up :) All you ladies hope you are all feeling good Love all you girls on this thread .....going through chemo is hard enough, talking about it to our family and friends is comforting, but getting through chemo with a bunch of girls like you all makes time go quick, and oh so much easier .. even if we did meet this way, I'm glad we DID meet.

I had such a good time at the chemo room today!!!! Showed everyone photos of DS at Kindy and then I met a lady whom asked if I'm on any 'drugs' because I was always smiling and seemed to be 'happy', well after telling her no and that i was happy because i had two more chemos left, she told me she has valium each time she goes in to have chemo as she is really down and depressed and can't shake it off ! She has a great sister as her rock and good family support. She doesn't have BC. I told her my story. She was so inspired to start picking herself up and stop feeling sorry for herself that when my DH came back into the room (he has ants in his pants and I honestly told him to go back home but he came.....so that was nice !!! ) she said to him \" Darling, you have such a lovely wife,(his eyes rolled thinking, well you don't know her well....lol)  she is my inspiration, she is so bubbly and has a great personality and full of life.....I'm so glad I met your wife today, she is a gorgeous girl and she has made my day\" (by this stage DH is smirking, oh I mean smiling at the lady thinking, this is my wife, you talking about her....lol )  ...... I had tears in my eyes, she was crying telling DH that. I'm glad that I  touched a lady there...trust me it wasn't a sob story either, very far from it...it was a pick her up kind of story that told her about life in general, that we can't dwell over things, what it is, is what it is at the end of the day, we just have to make do with what we have today, and live for tomorrow. That was my good deed for the day :) I gave her a hug as we walked out of the room together and told her to stay strong and that she was doing great. Like all my sisters here, you are all strong women, and i love coming on here to see what every ones up to, cooking, googling and TMI'ing about....lol Hugs to you all xx",

Websister, you are young...and glad that they are doing what they need to do re radiation with you..unfortunately I can't have radiation again on the same areas so I'm a little worried about that , but I guess I just have to go with it....thats why I'm having the BMX....and higher doses of chemo... fingers crossed it worked and working ! ( i guess looking at my head and nails if its done what its done on the outside I'm sure its done what it should have done on the inside hey!!) Enjoy your evening everyone and night night to those off to bedsys!! x",

So glad you can get all your emotions out at kick boxing. Sounds like fun. Glad you have one day out of the 7 dedicated to yourself..Lol. Liefie, sounds like a nice long weekend coming up for you with DD and her DH coming over. Make sure you post us picks of the blanket....and well, the booties we will wait for those later on .. lol. Nihahi, hope you are resting. Any planned moutain hikes planned for you soon ? Edi, cyber mummy, so glad you are sounding back to your old self. I went through a 'down ' stage right after my BMX now I just can't sit still. Always something fun and exciting planned. Yesterday I had coffee with my cousin whilst our kiddies were at kindy. Today had lunch with my long time school friend and her little girl who is a few months older than my DS. We then took the kids to a play centre so we could sit and chat while they had fun too. We had such a good time, chatting away and laughing. It was good. She also has been through a lot of her own issues lately and I just find it so hard to hear when people don't have that special family support as I have. It makes me sad. Well girls....I hope you enjoy your day and stay out of trouble xx",

Just a quick note to say hi, thinking of you all. Been busy of recent since starting back at work, started a little business of my own and keeping up with my little man is keeping me busy. But loving it and feeling great (knock on wood.) Dakota, my hair is so curly too....I straighten it, can't wait until the curls drop a little. Off to the hairdressers real soon so might get her to give it a little 'cut' to see how it goes. Don't want to cut too much incase those curls continue to 'spring' back up, they have a mighty bounce! Your kids are gorgeous ..... adorable. Liefie, good luck with your mammo tomorrow. Adagio, no news is good news :) Benny, you are looking mighty fine. Nihahi, hope you are relaxing now that you're weather is getting rather 'chilly'! We are still having 4 seasons in the one day!! one minute its raining, then sunny, it has no idea what it wants to do here!! Edi, I'm going to bingo this week or next with my mum. Can't wait. It's been a while so maybe I will have 'beginners luck again' ... yeh right, more like go there to warm up the seat so my mum says!!! but its the fun of it all. I just love when I get down to one number and my heart starts beating at a million miles an hour, then to hear a lady across the room scream out bingo....ahh shattered..LOL Maria, Good luck with your mammo tomorrow. Saw your pics of Vegas. hmm, very nice indeed. Getting to meet a superstar!! (well a lady with lots of money and fame for her daughters .. LOL) you looked so happy and GORGEOUS girl :) Morwena, ok, now i'm jealous. You enjoy yourself in Hawaii :) Websister, your life sounds busy too. It's good to get out there and get back in the swing of things with work isn't it. It's a little 'vacation' for me to go to work and leave the daily duties aside for a few hours :) Thinking of everyone. Hugs to you all xx",

They LOVE tennis. I was thinking the same as you. This time last year, you and those frozen peas and me with my damn wig running after my cheeky boy and holding on to it incase the wind took it off my head!! Look how far we have come in a year.

My brothers wife had a little baby girl :) Super Super cute and tiny. They named her Alyssia. So I haven't seen her in a couple of days with me being at work but I'm off for 5 days so I will smother her in kisses every day. Getting very clucky here LOL. Heat has settled, we had a 4 day heat wave over 40 degrees celcius whatever that is in your temperature it's bloody hot!! Was at my auntys house every night in he pool and not doing much except making salads and fruit salads!! Well my lovelies, must go to bed, 1am here. Hubby is out on a job. Thank goodness last day of work for him and 5 days off like me :)) Long weekend here on Monday so might get a way for a couple of days. Oh and my little business that I started in October is doing really well. I might even give up my 3 day job if it continues LOL. Take care and sorry for not being 'around'. I think of you ALL every day and glad I get to 'see' what you girls are up to on FB. Ahh the joys of social media.

Bioten did absolutely nothing for it...but my mouth wasn't dry, just yucky taste and a 'furry feeling tongue'...dreading it but hope the ice may help prevent that feeling at the least....I'll give anything a try. Rinsed my mouth with salt water with each meal or snack when I could helped a little. I'm still working through chemo...only 4 hours a day 3 days a week...gets my mind off things and feel sense of 'normality'. MeganB I have a wig , we coloured and cut it to my natural color with blonde foils...i left it longer than my shoulder length hair..anyone asks that I don't wish to tell I have BC I will say I got extensions...lol (everyones doing it now a days with the extensions) my wig is human hair sounds like yours is too if you are able to colour.....don't stress too much about your hair being short now, get your wig done the way you want it and perhaps tell the hairdresser to cut it an inch at a time...we cut it on my head to make it easier for me to see my desired length. (my cousin is a hair dresser so it was easier for me by the sounds of it I'm sorry you had such a bad experience with your hairdresser:( ) Also I purchased my wig from where they wanted me to measure my head and parts around it so that it fits me...with a wig cap on it fits perfect, perhaps try purchasing a wig cap as a suggestion as it is very secure....I don't have to wear it at the moment, but hair is shedding and I just can't wait for it to come out now but slowly and surely it will be a matter of time.....I'm wearing a cute cap at the moment when i go out only because of thinning at the top..I'm taking this a little better now...i'm so vaiin with my hair lol and this is the second time round its falling out...think its a little easier now then when I was 18 back at the other time.......good luck Thankful, my hair started shedding at day 13 .... i'm now day 20 and Its thinned from the top and i only cut it to shoulder length......hope that helps with your decision. Hope you all have a great SE free day ladies. ",

Same blah taste in mouth, same furry feeling of the tongue 2 days later, sore nails 2 days later, no nausea, headaches yes headaches but managable..... Joint pain from Neulasta shot day after but nothing too severe, have not had any other meds fpr it as they too are managable.      Fatique is still there but I don't have time to feel tired as I have an active; almost 3 year old. lol. Michelle, I'm having trouble with dexamethasone...I mean it's like the day before and 2 days after I feel ok'ish and no sleep then by the Friday when I don't take the steriods I'm feeling flat and sookyish....lol....its definetely the drugs..... I know that my onc said I needed to take them because it reduces fluid retention...is there any other 'plus' as to why we should take them , just curious ?? Take care ladies :)",

For bone pain I was just told to take Ibrufen as an anti - inflammatory ...I was having panadol as I can't take Ibrufen for my liver lesions ... 2 days and my bone pain was gone. Oh and I see some of you ladies are loving Saltines...well I just went and bought 2 packets today because I just can't get enough of them either!!! Hope you are all having a SE free day....:)",

At this stage I've opted for BMX but have the option to do that later. I'm going for implants, no tissue expanders ( I'll have excess skin with these DD boobies I got) so hoping that because I've been radiated on already my skin will heal nicely. I tried telling her well look at my lumpectomy site...it healed well and the BS was suprised at how quickly it healed....The PS sounded much more positive today although she kept saying you poor thing chemo, has a 3 year old , had Hodgkin's when she was younger, her head wasn't with it last time ( she was telling all this as if I wasn't there to the Breast Care nurse) like hellllloooooooooo I'm here, opposite you, helloo... knock knock!! but I just let her go.....let her say what she wanted because I sure did know what I wanted last time and again this time..yeh yeh poor me, but i'm living today don't feel sorry for me, do what needs to be done and thats that and do it right!! I found out that she operates with by BS so that's why I'm going to stick with this PS ..... don't get me wrong, she is ok and tells you the way it is.... I just don't like when she says i'm a 'rare' case when I'm sure there are many other women out there that have had radiation to the breast and thats why we are here talking and living BC because of it......

I ordered a new wig...a little shorter this one.....this is the next short step before my hair grows back and i'm ready to take it off and be with my 'boy look' as my DS calls me a 'boy' when I have my bandana on at home...lol..... well i'd better be off to bed, 1:15am here. Bin truck in the morning !!! DH has a day off tomorrow so routine out the door !! We are going to book somewhere nice to take DS when i finish chemo and before i have surgery..its our treat to our selves for going through all of this and for missing out on going away at christmas time. Might take him to see the fury penguins...they are cute and nice time of year to do it I think. We just bought mum and dad tickets and accomodation to fly interstate as their little treat and thank you.....they told me off and I said well you can't refuse them.....they are under your name and all booked.....:) Take care gorgeous girls and enjoy your Thursday xx",

DH sounds as adventurous as my DH......I remember going snorkelling for the first time on the cruise we went on for our honeymoon.....well never again will I go snorkelling. I got scared in the deep blue sea....lol and contracted 'coral infection' my foot was infected for the remainder of my trip and everyone started calling me 'coral girl' yeh great when I had to wear thongs on our ' fine dining dress up night' looked great with a cocktail dress and pink thongs( footwear girls, footwear!) lol. Edi, hope that hot water is fixed , connected and you can enjoy your peaceful bath. Hows your SE's this time around ? I'm ok (knock on wood) no loo visits (except wees)!! and I'm still an insomniac at the moment! I had an appt with my  BS...she is gorgeous, she was devestated hearing about that PS of mine that she called the head of PS at my hospital, he was in surgery at the time but answered his page and he said to tell me to wait for 30 mins, so all was good, went up checked in for chemo ( which was a 2 hour wait anyway) popped back down stairs and he came down. Appologised he wasn't in his suit ( told him I'm a casual kinda girl anyways, so long he was professional in his ways, I didn't care what he wore) lol......needless to say, professionalism was he key..he was fantastic...so girlies , I flashed my boobies to him....he took a pic on his phone ( told him not to save it as his wallpaper...lol) and he EXPLAINED in depth what was going to happen, how the procedure would take place, even drew it on a piece of paper for me to understand. he was brilliant. So I've sacked the B&^CH and I'm going with this guy. So rescheduling BMX for either first week in May or 3rd week in May....so I might be getting it around the same time Liefie I even got ASKED what size I wanted to be and as he was a Cosmetic surgeon also, I trust he knows what he is doing even more, he said we can make them sit up straight (non droopy) I'm so happy...new boobies here we come. ! I'm going to opt with tattoo nipples, just so I have something there still if you knwo what I mean. Anyone had them done before ?? Dakota, hope you and the kids are safe and doing ok hun. Scottiee, hope you are feeling better and Andrew is well. Sheryl, on the home stretch now hun, in your pockets. Carla, how did you go with that second opinion today? your rash doing ok ? I actually got a rash today on my neck.....one of the guys at work thought i got sunburnt, well my neck wasn't red this morning when I got ready, but at work it was!! go figure, maybe an alergic reaction to work me thinks....lol. Luvmy, hope your goats have come out to play ..... All other sisters I've missed hope you are doing well :)",

Good luck with your appointment. Movie, hope you are doing well and full of energy....I'm a little tired again today. Its 12;45am here, guess i should sleep up for my DH kinder tomorrow early start at 9am....so I have 4 hours to myself...ummm rest....noooo, coming back home to wash the floor and general stuff that I can do in an hour not 4 hours with DH home...lol Liefie, good luck with loosing those calories playing the organ...umm maybe in your fingers...lol Nihahi, how are you feeling now? How is your DD has she moved in (I'm not sure if I've missed any posts with you saying she has or still sorting out her belongings at your place) I know what you mean re waiting scenarios and then everything will seem to be a rush....I get all flustered when I go out to get the mail incase there is a letter from the hospital there, then I think well it needs to be done, but that ultimate feeling of 'getting the date ' will make it official i guess.....I know it sounds crazy...but I guess i am getting anxious now, I'm even biting off my DH's head at the drop of a hat, I'm amazed he hasn't kicked me out yet...lol Scottiee, hope you doing good. Ok girls, off to bed I go...enjoy your day all.",

Firstly, Alive...I want to welcome you to this thread however not a place I know we would have chosen to meet, but we are here and hey, we will help you get through this altogether. I must say, everything Liefie said I second that. I couldn't have put it better myself. So put on those big girl pants on Tuesday, and fight like hell because you WILL beat this. Treatments now a days are a lot different to 1995. (sorry to hear your mom was taken by this beast) but she too will be telling you to fight like hell!! Maria, Neuropathy is tingling in the hands and numbness. When we have a Axillary Disection, that is when they remove all of the lymph nodes and neuropathy can occur.  Also one of the side effects from Taxotere chemotherapy is Neuropathy. I will phone the hospital tomorrow to see if I can speak to someone about this. I need to call anyway to re schedule one of my MRIs that I need to have on Wednesday! Movie, hope you are sleeping soundly and snoring loudly x Liefie, you are going to look hot hot hot for your DDs wedding. New Boobies, new tummy new dress new you :) I want photos too ok.....I won't forget November! Did you weigh yourself after the organ playing, how much weight did you loose, lol lol ! Nihahi, I hope you are healing up well. I WILL call the docs tomorrow instead of popping into the chemist to get vitamins but will keep Vit B in mind when speaking with doctor tomorrow as Liefie suggested. Edi, i just want to squeeze your GD and give her a big hug...she sounds absolutely adorable , specially the scenario at the pub. Such a darling. Glad you enjoyed your day with her. We went out for a drive today and ended up over an hour away at a factory outlet that sold canned fruit and bits and pieces ... very cheap, came out $100 later with lots of goodies and brought some stuff for mum and aunty. My SIL came with us, was lots of fun. (my brother sad he was working) !  Next weekend looks like good weather so may go up to the other side of town to the markets and they have lots of great kids rides there and family picnic area.....may as well get as much of this in before surgery and while weather still shows a pic of the 'sun' !! Dakota, hope you relaxing girl this weekend !! Websister, hope you are well and mom is well . Carlads, how you feeling ? Hope Taxotere not kicking in with too many SE's on your last one...... Caitlin, how are you ? saw FB where your gardenings done .... is your hubby home again ? Love to all you girls. Enjoy your Sunday.....xox",

Once you meet with your onc on Tuesday and you get more information and work out a treatment plan you will start feeling a lot more better and a little less anxious.  This board has helped me out from my diagnosis and these girls have been with me throughout treatment. I was diagnosed in August and started treatment end of Oct 2012 and completed treatment March 2013, currently waiting for a BMX ( Bilateral Masectomy) You will find these girls so helpful and full of wisdom and knowledge. We've laughed, cried, vented, ranted, chanted and yes, we are all a little crazy, but in a good way of course  If you have any questions for us please do post. This board is a 24/7 around the clock board we have girls from Canada, USA and UK and of course me from the land downunder Australia   Wishing you all the best for Tuesday. Thanks Dakota , yep still need that date...so over waiting now so just plodding along! lol. Enjoy your day tomorrow with your daughter and her friend, i'm sure you're going to luv it !! (who knows probably more than them.) maybe meet a 'potential' on the way...lol Websister, so good that you had good 'pictures' taken. Prayers for you that they are pictures of smiling bones all healthy and strong x Nihahi, when I type on my phone you can all tell, its short and sweet....lol. Hope that lap top gets fixed soon so you can put up pics of our meadow!! Liefie, thinking of you x Edi, oh my gosh, has someone stolen your notebook? DH didn't sit on it did he? , or he has taken it from you so you can finish off renovations now that you are 'done' with treatment? or did you win that jackpot at bingo and now you are out galavanting spending all your winnings?.....hmmmm making cakes ? well whatever it is you are doing, hope you are being a good girl   Movie, you are having too many busy days lately.....well I guess you will be relaxing in Japan soon enough !! Alive / Maria, you girls are sounding great. I'm so happy for you both. Caitlin, I'm loving the avatar, you gorgeous girl.  So happy you have now finished chemo and ready to rock. Glad you have your mum over to help out over the next couple of yuck days.....hoping minimal SEs for you x Well I had a great relaxing day. DS was off at kindy, DH had the day off so went grocery shopping , never again....he is a pain in the butt, like a little kid ( i'm hungry, I'm tired, are you finished yet!!) MY time DH MY time...go sit in the car if you are tired!! arghhh MEN! DS has his first birthday party to go to tomorrow, a boy at his kinder class, should be fun !! ( Dakota, I'll swap with you, you can go to a 4 year old party and I'll take the girls to their concert, whos in concert ??) guess you can tell I'm not on my phone tonight....lol.... Love you chickadees.....enjoy your day, its night night time for me soon I think.....xx",

Alive, I know that WHEN I'm in for my BMX I'm in for 3 days to 5 days only because I have radiated skin already in the breast area....normally my surgeon said 3 days max is required to ensure there is no infection and healing is ok.

I'll call my chemo ward tomorrow to see if I can take a pro-biotic like inner health plus or something (thanks soooo much for that tip)  As for the fuzzy tongue, that happened on the 2nd day didn't think it would be due to low Blood Counts...that early along anyway :( Carla I too had mammogram, Ultrasound, biopsy, lumpectomy, node removal, then full node removal, CT scan, bone scan and Chest scans....I requested MRI (we don't pay as public patients in Australia) and even the MRI didn't find any positive nodes however 2/2 came back positive after biopsy !!! Edi, its amazing when we say we have BC how many people 'come out' and say they had it too or know of someone. My local lady that takes my bloods lifted her top up one day and showed me her bra 'padded' with no boobie.....she is a survivor from 1995 and the lady from the IVF place I went to see had BC in 1997 and had a double masectomy...it makes you happy hearing long term survivor stories ! You are so right, BC Sisters are great! Naaw, your mum will be with you right now helping you through this, thats why you are such a strong person getting through this day by day with her by your side, she'd be so proud of you and your strong positive attitude! How did you go wig shopping today and your lunching :) Hope you ended up with that bright pink afro....lol I actually found a place in Beijing that ship direct from factory and they were 75% cheaper than the real human hair wigs you buy from wig shops here in Melbourne ! I even paid express & had it measured up to my head! so if you didn't end up finding the one you truely want today let me know and I'll give you that name of the place I went through.  I love Bones too.....tonight its Criminal Minds night.....double episode, its sad , thats all thats on now a days, crime! my DH also hates gruesome tv.... I love watching that Embaressing Bodies and stuff like that, but no he hates all that sort of stuff!  Well hope you had an amazing day filled with fun and laughter with your friends and an even better arvo / evening with your GD and made something extra yummy for dessert.....lol Good Luck for tomorrow Dakota (well it's the 8th Nov here in Australia) with your first treatment.....hope everything runs smoothly for you with no SE's",

I must say fatigue is whats getting me, luckily there's no nausea ... i've been trying to drink more as I'm getting headaches a lot lately, more like tension ones. but even water is tasting like crap!!

I'm glad all the effects have passed for you now on this bitch of a drug :) Did your nail beds hurt ? mine are a little and before treatment I was told which I did,   put clear hardner on them but they feel so sensitive and I don't know if it's because of this hardner but they are growing longer like they are on steroids !!!  I don't have any inflammation thank goodness, had no reaction at all....I actually felt good day 1-6 , yesterday day 7 bad bad bone pain and today happy as larry NORMAL again, actually DID go out for a walk in the park with my son to feed the ducks ! lol  Excercise, well thats not so hard, I have a almost 3 year old so he doesn't exactly let me sit on my back side long enough to chillax.....so walking or 'running' after him is generally done 'most of the time' ..... I'm not trying to be a hero in all of this...I'm a strong person but nows the time I'm letting everyone close that wants to help help me out even something small so I can just get better :)",

Thanks for lurking ;) can you please tell me what Keffir is as a priobiotic ? I take 'inner health plus' in tablet form 'sometimes' and was wondering I have heard of Keffir before but not sure if they have it everywhere or is it just in the USA ? Edi, my nails were growing at the start real fast, like they were on their own kind of steriods...lol, now I have my left pointer finger looks like its going to come off...onc seems to think its just the new one pushing its way through, but if you ask me, it feels like when my acrylic nails were coming off....so hmmm... I'm hoping it doesn't but if it does well, so be it :( The fires are terrible Edi, so many houses burnt down in Tasmania this week.....I'm sure your friend hasn't posted on FB because they may not have any power....prayers for your friends Edi. We had very bad bush fires here back in 2009 luckily they were across the highway and didn't make it over to this side where I live..many lives lost that weekend, one we can never forget...they call it Black Saturday! SE's still minimal thank goodness....just when I take the C part of CMF in oral form about 1hour after and lasts for a couple of hours I may get a little light headed and nauseated but nothing to go crazy over, haven't touched my nausea meds and still managed to get out to do the shopping but had hubby with me today as I gave mum the 'weekend off' and she has taken her new car off for a drive with my dad to a place called Albury....(3 hours away) to play the pokies....lol.....for a couple of days......they deserve it :) Other than that Edi, you are going to find CMF totally different and I hope that you too won't have any SE's. Hair feels prickly too......hopefully it comes back earlier than expected, that would be a nice b'day pressie for me in March to have my hair back. Nihahi / Bearcub, Going to need that snow of yours on Monday, its going to be back up to 38degrees here in Melbourne !! Bevlee, how are you going in the heat hun ?? No SE's from chemo ?? Dakota, How you going still no SE's I hope from the Taxol no muscle aches / pains ?? Websister, hope your head is ok now and not giving you any grief. Hope all you ladies have a wonderful Saturday",

(not every 3 weeks for me anymore) is this your 4th one right ? So CMF in 3 weeks ? @Benny, you like spiders, hmmm....If I had a 'herbert' in my bathroom he wouldn't be lasting 4 days thats for sure...lol....came home today and hubby said he saw a huntsman outside but it got too high so its still lurking out there somewhere...eek!  (thats what was in my kitchen re the story I posted about last time, they are ugly ) !!! The list of food you've made sounds yummy.......you will get there soon enough to eat all that.....( I won't tell you that I had some onion rings from Hungry Jacks the other day ok!! ) Now you ask re Taxotere, I didn't like it one bit, not to say that you may like it more than a/c, we are all different and remember I only had x 3 of Taxotere so mine could have been more intense...how many rounds are you having of the Taxotere ?? Don't stress, just get through your A/C now and like  Websister said there are other options so perhaps your onc will suggest Taxol instead.....hope the antibiotics is working for you. With the CMF I'm on now, mucicitos is very common too! @Websister, I'm doing great hun post chemo, have another one scheduled for Wednesday so that will complete 1 round then 2 more rounds to go (4 chemos) and I'm done !! so counting down..... How are you going ? headaches gone or still lingering because of that Hercipren? Hows your mum doing, did she venture out to that common area after you dolled her up with her hair ?? (god bless her, she sounds so cute). @Caitlin, I'm glad you stopped 'lurking' and joined in......we're all a little whacky in our own ways but that's what makes us all special.....lol....... Husbands are funny things aren't they......mine too doesn't show he's feelings...its hard to try and read there minds on the best of days let alone what they are thinking through this toughest part of our lives....but I guess that's life and we will all get through it and so will our hubbys. ( I just wish mine read books because I would have brought him the book Edi (Scouser) recommends!! Re : Taxotere, I iced the finger nails and toes......I used frozen Ice packs .. you can take peas and even what Maureen suggested, frozen ice bottles......they will all do the same trick. Make sure you moisturise your feet and hands as Tax does make you peel...I peeled and peeled like a shedding snake....it got bad at one stage felt like I burnt myself but more ice will make them feel better. Use a nail hardner on your nails too....I used the Sally Hansen Hard as Nails.....Nails can lift off....mine were ok, as they are growing out I have 1 that feels like its coming off and 2 that are a little higher than the normal part of the nail ( looks like when you need Acrylic refills) now I just colour my nails and can't really tell...they don't look that bad ! I did get Neuropathy, I went 1 week where I couldn't really walk all that well....well I had no choice but to walk well actually run, with a 3 year old...lol.....but that was BEFORE I iced my feet and toenails so hopefully it won't happen to you. There is a Taxotere thread on here also incase you want to jump on that and see what the other ladies wrote, you are more than welcome to PM me with any questions too I'll be happy to help. Nihahi, hope your shoulders are better today Carlads, hows things going ? Dakota, soccer, hockey, did you have time to scratch your behind ... lol ( its a funny saying in aust land) lol.??",

Did you have Hodgkin's Disease/Lymphoma when you were young with chemo and/or radiation or did you just have your lymphnodes removed and that was all ? I had Hodgkin's Disease when I was 18 with several chemotherapy combo's along with stem cell transplant AND Mantle Radiation.....I have since then had a baby whom will be 3 on Christmas Day. I am now 34 years of age. I found a small lump in August...biopsy came back positive for IDC bc Grade 3 and now I'm preparing for first cycle of chemo next Weds 24th Oct.!! The mammo didn't pick it up as cancer however the Ultrasound pretty much confirmed it then the biopsy and so I then had a lumpectomy...2/2 nodes positive so I had a axillary dissection with the remaining 8 nodes negative :) Hope you are well and what you are worrying about is absolutely nothing.....( I stress too about little back pain etc I feel .... everyone says 'its in my head' and to be honest...it is (knock on wood) as all my CTs ultrasounds PETS and bone scans came back all clear) except for a couple of liver lesions -- which i've had from being on the contraceptive pill for a long time though since coming off them they have significantly decreased or vanished :) I also have a very small lung nodule which is from the mantle radiation which is being monitored!

I was just reading your post re the treatment options to us 'special' people as they call us with previous history! I was originally going to have FEC-T then my onc was like no, looked at my history, didn't want me to have the 'E' as he wanted me to be here for 30+years and not die of cardiac reasons, so then after he spoke with oncs in the UK (where he is from) and in the USA they decided to run with the Taxotere first then 3 rounds of the CMF. Are you only having C&T ? Ladies, Wigs, apart from my real hair being thinner than what my wig actual is the colour is the same and its a full lace wig, not itchy at all and real human hair.....I'm loving it.....I don't have to style it everyday and between shower and make up I'm cutting it down to 15 mins getting ready opposed to 40 mins with hair...lol.....(hubbys loving it on the weekends when we go out) ! At home though I take my wig off and put this pre-tied bandana on and its sooo comfy & stylish! I haven't lost all of my hair so it looks like I just have put some hair 'in' the bandana and left wisps of hair out and around my ears...I call them my own 'bangs' lol Politicomama don't worry about the people staring, stare back at them I say....you're better than they are...they were obviously never raised or taught that it was rude to stare at people. I don't know why people stare.....we have cancer ..... we are dealing with it and we don't want pity or to be stared at, we just want people to look at us like normal people fighting for our lives...... Don't you just wish you could yell out to the 'starers ' \"hey am I wearing something of yours\" or 'take a photo it will last longer and you can analyse whatever it is better' !! ohhh that makes me mad hearing stories like that :(  To all you ladies out there, hope you have minimal SE's today/tonight.

I just think if I loose my hair and I'm getting better and beating this C then it doesn't matter, it will grow back.

(like all of us) Grade 3 (like me) is an agressive form of Breast cancer....your next step would be to discuss removal via lumpectomy or via masectomy depending on the size of the lump and this again your surgeon will discuss best option. I opted for lumpectomy, chemo then masectomy (both) as I don't want a reoccurance on the other breast not effected. (still to happen I'm currently doing chemotherapy). Your surgeon will also take a few lymph nodes out to see if there has been any involvement..(2 of mine were, therefor I needed axillary disection - all lymph nodes removed to ensure no further spread) then scans of the chest, bones etc. It does all happen quickly from diagnosis so postponing your trip probably is the better option full of doc appointments and plans. I am promising my son that by Easter time we will go away in a plane ( he is 3). Once you have worked out a plan with the docs then you will not feel so overwhelmed....its the diagnosis point (that I felt and many others here) that overwhelmed us all, not knowing is the scariest bit, but trust me, everything will fall into place once a plan of action is arranged for you . Hope this info has helped you out a little. Good Luck and yes we are all here to lend a helping hand and listen .",

I noticed hair on my legs ( I know its not somethign I would have been excited about before chemo, but wow, I can shave my legs tomorrow to wear my dress to my appt with the dreaded Plastic surgeon !! The hair on my head is growing too.....its not prickly its actually nice and soft.....and not grey like I thought it might come back with all the stress....lol...I'm so excited I was standing in the bathroom taking photos of my head to send it to my mum.....this was at midnight last night ... lol...... Lifie, glad you got to sleep and dreamt of food other than the 'plumbers crack' lol....... Dakota, how are you hunni ? Kids having fun at day care ? Scottie, thanks for sharing story..... Keemo, I loooove Greys Anatomy, DH doesn't like 'gory' things they show on tv so I tape it if he isn't asleep already by the time the show starts....lol My DH just went off to bed.....I am such a good wifey, just made him some bacon and eggs for breakfast to take to work.....! It was so funny, just now he was sleeping on couch and made like a bird noise in his sleep.....he woke up and said what where, I said 'over there in the tree' DH looking around quiet dillusional at this point , here i am laughing about to pee my pants trying not to be too loud as to not wake up the 'miniature steam train' (DS) Glad everyone is sounding well ...... I'm off to play some Bejeweled and Candy Saga on FB.....( a little addictive ) lol Hugs to all you gorgeous girls xx",

I really should have listened to mum and not walked into the kindy room so I can avoid germs, but its sooooo hard especially when DS wants me to see him doing a few things before we go :( lol, i'm sure hubby would have been 'delighted' for you to go to the mountains this weekend, may have kept you occupied other than that stupid Alien starting up......thanks for being in my pockets on Wednesay for me, Edi's Tuesdsay, just make sure you don't leave any crumbs behind or start laughing if they can't find my veins, you will feel my steam coming out of everywhere ..... lol Oh yeh, dakota did the cockroach turn up at home ? hmmm hoping thats why you didn't show today ?",

I have teary's all the damn time..lol...my so called DH calls me a sooki sooki lala......hmmmm I'm so emotional..lol think it may be a mix of Zoladex and hormones at their lowest (which is what I want I guess so its not feeding this damn BC). I got my letter from PS today saying that i'm not in the 'urgent' category for my BMX but it will happen within the next 90 days and after the 23rd April as they wait until chemo is done and dusted !! Can't wait to visit my BS on Weds before chemo to talk to her about all of this...she understands and is compationate not like the PS.....! so much for 'tentatively booking in for the 9th May...so who knows now! Liefie, lentils is what i put in my mixed veggie soup with a piece of hock ( bacon ) so its a mixture of yours and Edis soup...lol...Edi, my nanna use to put in the split peas, we just soaked them in the soup just like the lentils, but as I grew older and realised that split peas wasn't for me , they started adding lentils....lol. Liefie, DH sleeps on his back most of the time until i 'gentley' give him the nudge/tap/kick to turn over......he's laying on the couch as I type snoring away and he is on his side...think I might play DS game of rolling him off the couch...surely he'd stop snoring then you think!! jennie, you are so not alone in the 'dark places' I go there often and I know I need to snap out of it.....we are all strong, we just need to stop going to the dark places too often because its ugly !! Dakota, thinking of you hunni, hope you and the kids are ok ?? Well I'm off to bed I think.......11:30pm here, work tomorrow and going to be another hot one. Took DS to the park before and to feed the ducks...was a nice evening walk and play on the swings (love feeling like a kid again without a worry in the world).",

As Liefie pointed out, look at what you have been through, just because you don't need chemo, rads and perhaps hormone blocker is great news. Trust us, if we didn't need it then we wouldn't be going through it either, you've done the necessary things to beat this crap then you have done what you need and time to move on from this thing. Liefie, unfortunately hubby and I are so spontanious that I didn't 'plan' to go snorkelling therefore didn't have the necessary footwear!! would have been better off going in with my pink thongs that way I wouldn't have stepped on the damn coral, no one said it was poisoness and could have been real bad....(didn't know coral disease was so infectionous) thus saying i've never been near coral again and that was 4.5 years ago...lol Can't believe you didn't even get told about the canule in your eye.....unbelievable some doctors are. And you don't even know its in there!! I'm so relieved that I have a good PS now and that I TRUST him :) Now I am prepared and ready for when they call me up to tell me to go have surgery done.....I'm scared but I know its for the best and the right thing to do. I'm more worried about being locked up for recovery...lol Sweat dreams, sounds like your day tomorrow is busy busy busy.....night night x",

I saw my PT and with some excercises they gave me it has reduced dramatically. It all started with the cording...I use to do stretches as excercises , it hurt like hell doing them but they managed the cording and since haven't had it again.

It was my cousins 13th birthday party today and turned out to be a pool party. was fantastic, great food, company and lots of fun for young and old.

Now, Nihahi, no coffee pre-surgery, please explain because I may go insane with no morning coffee ??  Websister, sad to hear your mom didn't remember your birthday. So long as she remembered you that's most important. Poor mom has taken on lots the past few months (that we know of here) she sounds like a strong woman Edi, my dad is renovating my auntys ensuite with my uncle....my dad is a 'jack of all trades master of none' lol....though he is really good with what he does....(they sometimes say you marry someone like your father, sadly enough, I met his match, perfectionist and knows how to do everything...lol) Its funny, I was over 2 days ago and mum, aunty and I were in the living room with DS.....then BOOM....DS said, 'mummy what was that, it wasn't me', I replied \" no darlin' that was not you, it was Dumb and Dumber'...everyone laughing......DS replying, whos Dumb and Dumber!!! Needless to say we thought it was the basin, luckily it was a tile!! Are you getting the frameless shower doors ? they are very sensitive and can crack at any time...my SIL use to work for a place that sold all that sort of stuff and the amount of DIY people that use to come back and order another one was endless!! Hope that DH of yours controls himself today so you don't have to deal with it when you get back from Rads !!!! So happy you are plodding through your chemo and rads. So when is your last chemo ? Now I've spoken to Johnny Cash and told him that you do not want him to visit you this time around....!! Liefie, love it, the thought of a bride walking down the isle with a gorgeous pot plant you created...lol....perhaps your DD can get you to organise her flowers for her wedding... I am not a green thumb, took after my mum there...lol...Funny, one year my aunty and uncle were overseas and left us looking after their house , mum thought she would do a good deed and pull out some weeds from their front garden....dad went over the next day to water the plants and came back to say that someone stole the plants my uncle had planted not too long ago ... mum said oh really from where, dad described the location, when mum and I looked at eachother, well I uncontrollable laughed that much I had tears in my eyes.....Mum's good deed turned out to be her taking out the newly planted plants that had not flowered yet (obviously) ... so dad went and replaced them all before my uncle came back...though of course the flowers were carnations, dad didn't get the right colours so once they blossomed...  so mum was caught out....we still laugh about it all the time and just keep mum well away from the garden (everybodies garden) lol!!! Jackie, what a gorgeous gift your DD brought back from Tokyo. With the hot flashes, it should work a treat :) I cook with corn beef, but its like spam..it sounds yuck, but my nanna use to make it as a sauce with spaghetti....its been passed down and its a big maltese thing...well I love it and now my DS loves it. On Good Friday we don't eat meat, so lunch time I made ricotta ravioli served with a plain tomato and onion based sauce...my DS looks at me and says yuk, wheres the meat (corn beef) i said well i made it different today.... arghhh.....Your lunch sounded yummy. God Bless your mom who's 96 years old bring on 100 Laurie, hope you are well. Did you have your MRI yet hun ? Caitlin / Scottiee / Dakota and all you other girls I've missed out on  how are you going ?? Carlads xoxo (love your PMs on FB. luv you girl) Last day of work tomorrow for a few months....then 4 more 'sleeps' til little vacation....just can't wait. The weather is hotting up for the weekend again ( this is real climate change!!) so we may we just may get to go to the beach in Phillip Island and will be a nice evening for the penquin visit too on Sunday night , we are all getting just a lil' excited now!",

Dakota you are probably done and resting and Nihahi would be at the hospital prepping up for her alien exchange ..... My little family holiday was great. It was nice and relaxing. We made chocolate (and ate it)!! at the chocolate factory, saw the fury penquins come out and walk around...they were so cute, DS didn't know where to look, DH had to stop him from crossing the barriers to try and catch one to pat.....wow what a scene DS caused....lol he did manage to go out with a fury penquin from the souvenior shop that he happily waited while mummy paid for it!!! We saw Koalas sleeping , fed the Kangaroos, patted Lizards, saw Eagles (in a cage not like Nihahi's pic out in the wild) !! and even managed to talk to a cockatoo....(I was talking to the bird and all of a sudden it turned and got angry at me.) DH was laughing because I literally almost s#*t myself thinking this cocktoo was going to take off with my wig.....lol...what a scene !! Well I have a full head of hair, but still could you imagine that would have been a Kodak moment forsure! We played in the sand, DH trying to catch me to throw sand on me ( well he managed to get me as I fell on my butt....yes on my butt whilst DH not so DH laughed yet again at my expense...(well it was very funny, DS laughed uncontrollably but didn't help mummy up , too busy throwing sand ) we had a great time flying DS's new kite too. It was great to get out and about, enjoy the fresh air and laugh and play. I don't know how to post pics but have some really nice ones up close of Kangaroos and Koalas but no fury penquins. We were not allowed to take pics at all.....no flashes allowed and it was too dark. I took my phone out to take a pic...I did get a few but they are too too dark as there was not enough lighting, just as I put my phone away I was tapped on the shoulder by a security guard and got told off .... see girls I got introuble for my sisters...lol...DH said naughty naughty...lol. Yeh Edi, you won at bingo...you go girl :) So glad you are feeling well and with enough energy through out Rads and chemo. How many more now ?? Websister, now how did you know I would have loved to have stayed longer at Phillip Island!! hope you had a great time out with your friend for lunch and you are taking it easy and resting when body tells you too.....I remember those rads days, it knocked me out more than the chemo itself...always fatigued and lasted a few months post rads...hang in there, you are doing so well :) How's mom? Liefie, hope you are feeling much better and looking forward to November when you will be at your DD's wedding..how exciting, always good when there is something to look forward to :) Hope you are having sunshine in Vancouver and managed a pedi and relaxation time. How exciting, your pixie is no longer a pixie, I have the pixie, its just started going over my ears....my hair is so dark again ( can't wait til I can put blonde through it again!! ) Did you get your hair cut yet ??  You made me laugh with your trainer being 6 ft tall and you having to run to just 'walk' with her....I was like that with my manager at work...here was this 6 ft women walking with me a 5ft migit...lol and I would be running to keep up with her, she would talk fast and walk fast so sometimes words that would want to come out of my mouth would get jumbled up just trying to get a word in ( ha, who would have figured that would happen to me) lol.  Enjoy your sleepover :) Caitlin, I'm like you, I go wigless at home ( now that I have hair) but still in the big world I'm wearing my wig. Yesterday I had to pop out to quickly get some things from the shops.....so it was cold, changed into my leggings, boots, top and puffy black new vest I bought (zip one) then got DS into the car....DH sitting inside sees me running back inside and said whats wrong with you....I laugh out .... whoops, I forgot my hair.....lol ( I only noticed because whilst everywhere else was warm on me, my head was cold...lol) even DS had a laugh when mummy explained to him what happened!!! Movie, hope you are doing well and resting after your gym workout...you ladies make me feel like a blimp......lol....guess I run after a 3 year old, does that count for a work out....lol Scottiee, luvmy , bearcub, jennie. Carlads, hope everyone is doing well and so sorry if I've missed any one or any questions directed to me...there was a lot of reading. Benny, hope you are ok hun. Remember you are the one that brought our little family here together, if it wasn't for you we would be scattered all around the place........hope you are having a better time with the rads and getting through them like a breeze and enjoying time with your plush toy..... Take care everyone, figure its almost 1:30am so best I try getting some sleep xoxo luv you girls xoxox",

Cold here in Melbourne, no snow where I am Nihahi, but the mountains couple of hours from here do. I might take DS to the snow this year. Depends on WHEN I have my surgery and if it is actually still winter...lol. I'm seeing my onc on Wednesday so I will be asking, requesting and demanding a date before I leave !! I know he has nothing to do with scheduling the surgery but my BS and the BC nurse are on that day also so I can quickly ask for a chat with them!! I'm also feeling 'tender' in between the breast area...not sure if thats the sternum or the part below that, it feels like a big lump but weird, I can only feel it at certain times, it's probably part of my body that is in the right place and meant to be there if you know what I mean, but will ask to see if it is and if I can get a scan to confirm its all ok because my mind is a little 'going in dark places' at times!!

I must admit, my boss has been nice. Hasn't hassled me of when I'm going back, the girl I work with is in constant contact as a 'friend' not a 'collegue'. They even sent me a big bunch of flowers and chocolates when they knew i was back home from surgery. They are a very sweet company that have been overly good to me. They think the office is too quiet without me though...they want 'life' back in the office.....I try telling them 'who me, talkative, get outta here'! LOL. Hope you've had that wake up coffee and ready to start your Friday. Its just on midnight here, Saturday now. I think I will go to bed shortly. We are going out for dinner to my cousins house tomorrow which will be nice.

I said 'yeh, well you can get away with it for now, but when mummys all better you are back home because I miss you toooooooooooo much' DS replied, ' yes mummy, I miss you too, but I like staying here' hmmm maybe because he gets his own way!!!!

Now for some well earned retail therapy tomorrow you think? LOL Maria, the tingly is most likely from the nerves. I had it a few months post surgery. You are NOT turning into a  hypochondriac. I use to think that too about me...LOL.  Movie, glad DD's surgery went well. So long as the extra pill does what it needs to do, then another pill it is right? Liefie, yeh, road trip, how exciting. Always nice to get away. Enjoy your trip. It's well deserved. Edi, happy dance for shed man. How's GD afternoon go? Love the pic of the ship. I was told that we can use a more 'gentle ' colour , my cousin just won't put peroxide / amonia in it this time around. We will go gentle, thanks for the heads up. Have heard about the vegetable colour. Nihahi, you are so sweet. Stay dry and safe. Sounds like your weather is a little crazy. Thought it was suppose to be summer for you too ???

My new 'girls' are good. Love going bra shopping now. Can buy nice pretty coloured padded bras ( just to give it a little more of a 'bigger' look ) Jo, great news with clear nodes. Sorry that you didn't get the clear margins. Are they scheduling surgery again ?  Hope you got to sleep again. Nothing like getting up in the middle of the night and staying up.

Dakota, enjoy your weekend away, you sooooooo deserve it girl and bet you will look younger and more gorgeous then your fellow college girls .... enjoy your night xx Websister, nothing worse then seeing pics of your self in your folder, you poor thing. That happened to me when I was having rads a long time ago, I was very embaressed, its bad enough I had to see my body in the mirror, lol but seeing them in my file, was a little degrading. Like liefie said, I had to stand there whilst that Plastic Surgeon took photos of my boobies, prodding at them, lifting them up, photos of the lumpectomy scar and all......this was while I was listening to her telling me that I had 'quite large boobs' and that  I needed to 'loose some tummy fat' if I wanted the tram flap or diep or whatever you call it.....oh did I just want to knock her out with my 'large boobs'!!! Lifie, glad you got to eat your chinese.....and down those coffees and cookies while waiting for DH's car to get ready. You make me laugh, hope you had something for dinner ! Oh 46andsingle, I try to be positive, I do have my down days , but we have to think positive ..... this is a nightmare and we all didn't ask for it. We are all here to help, pm me if you need a chat hun. Re pre-chemo surgery. Well I had a 16mm lump. They would normally just do a lumpectomy and rads on it with a little chemo due to the grade 3 status. However due to me already having rads ( reason why I'm here today due to rads triggering BC) It is recommended for me to have chemo, MX and tamoxifen after. As my head and heart were not ready to part with a boob ( as we all know, this all just happens too quick from tests,DX, talking of chemo and MX ) I was told that a lumpectomy was good to do now to get rid of the cancer and after chemo we can come back to arrange a MX. (again only due to the recurrance factor due to radiation I had in the past)            Since then, as much as we are all not ready to part with a breast or both my head and heart are in the right place to do so....(after all, it is the right thing to do ) now I have decided to have both gone. Just not sure if I'm going to do one at a time or both , opting for both to get it over and done with I guess so to speak. Ladies, enjoy your Friday..... Morning Edi, if I'm right its about 6:30am...I'm hearing you coming down the stairs to make a cuppa tea!!",

I guess the BS and onc agreed that MX was ok to do so after chemo. I did stress that just because my heart and head weren't in the right place at time of DX I was ready to do it if that means it was better to do before the chemo, they suggested they would do lumpectomy and get that damn C out of me......do chemo and within the first half of 2013 to do the MX or BMX so long as the right boobie was done first!  Edi, cyber mummy, its now 7pm here and I'm finally sitting my butt down after dinner watching Home And Away....after that I'll give DS a bath and hopefully he will have a early night while DH is out with his mates hunting.... Our school/kindy terms are different, the kids just started back at school some late Jan some first week Feb. 1st term ends here the week before Easter which is early this year ! (DH is back on call that week....not fussed considering I miss out on going to the dreaded MILs house...lol I know I'm a B&$#@ but you know what....I'm sick of being nice to her. My mum taught me always to be nice to people and to treat people with respect, she still tells me now...lol but I tell her that I'm over respect with the MIL, I would have gone there without DH however under the circumstances, I'm NOT.....I normally give into people when it comes to forgiving...yes I forgive her for what she has done to my family however I will never forgert...I'm civil with her and thats it...!! What's planned for your Friday ? Shopping or rest ? GD's coming for a visit this weekend ?",

The poor mum that's left behind still grieving no doubt her husband and now her own son.....I never knew there was sudden adult death syndrome.....my gosh how damn sad! Well enjoy your retail therapy, bits and bobs are good.... lol .... and enjoy watching your TV shows while DH is working hard for the money...lol.... Ladies at Kindy said to mum and I today ' did you girls go shopping today again' and I replied ' yes' one of them said ' you'll run out of money if you keep going 2 days a week for 3 hours ' I said, ' no thats why hubby does Over time, whats his is mine and whats mine is mine' as the saying goes....lol I think though next week, well mum will take DS to kindy on Weds as I have a onc appt before chemo and then on Friday I think I may come back home ( its a 20 min drive to his kindy as the ones in my area only went for 2 hours a week, whereas the one I got DS in is 6 hours a week over two days!!! more interaction with kids and listening skills with other adults is required...lol!!!!! ) so may just make my way back home to wash the floor in peace instead of taking him to mums house.....lol.",

I spoke with my onc today and he said pains I'm having 'normal' :) I don't have to see him until June  ! after my BMX:) Its all happening :) scared but need it to be done and dealt with. I'm not having TE's so I feel a little better about the 'one step implant'. Found out why I didn't get oncotype scoring done, it costs $4000 here and in the US it's covered by insurance therefor they get it done. But felt reassured that onc said that it didn't matter regardless if I had it done or not, under the circumstances of my history I would have had to get the chemo regardless :). He did tell me to 'stop getting all excited' over my hair growth and that it 'wont fall out' but will 'slow down' I did say that i'm happy that it's coming back and if it does mean it will stop growing for the 3 weeks then so be it.....after all, life's more important than hair hey!! Edi, I only had the one dose of steriods this morning, still had oral ones left from the Taxotere so had 2 of those in the morning to save me 10 mins through IV :) I was blah blah blah this morning and now I'm a little on the tired side, might be the rain I can hear it saying 'come in bed Tracey, its nice and cosy and you can listen to me pitter patter on the roof all night long' ... lol. I WISH I lost some weight...... I've put on 7 kgs , yes 7 kilos since starting chemo. More with the Tax with the steriods...I don't have much of a appetite with CMF and eating healthier,...just as well thats why I've stayed 'steady' with my weight !! lol,  you too funny cyber mummy.....'if you can get the cheese out of the mouse trap' your DH would be delighted i'm sure.....yeh being night tonight...make sure you call out bingo really loud ok! So glad you feeling well Edi, those loo trips are already horrifying me...but better out then in I guess....i've lost count on the trips to the loo already and its only 10:30pm here. (11:30am for you if I'm right) . Glad plumbers finished there job. Now you can make tea for two dear ..! :) Nihahi, jury duty, I've always wanted to do that !! Can't believe there are 365 days in the year and your DH gets chosen on YOUR SPECIAL DAY!! what the.....well I'm sure he will get out of it under the circumstances, I've had lots of friends here get called up and they use every excuse under the sun and get out of it..... movie, glad the coidene cough syrup working a treat for you :) Sheryl, lol so know about the food bit with TAX....I still ate anything and everything even when my taste buds were shot thinking that they would come back eating something yummy......mine are gone at the moment due to this damn flu i have every now and then I get the taste buds back, then boom, shot down as quick as they came back.....damn flu and damn taxotere! Hope they come back soon for you! Off to bed soon, figure I should TRY to get some sleep tonight.....work tomorrow then 3 days off....ahhh. Night night everyone hugs to all",

So I had an Axillary Dissection......removed 8 more nodes that were nice and clean :) Being Grade 3 is more agressive so I am going in for a masectomy after chemo ( it was hard enough for me to deal with BC and loosing my breast so my surgeon agreed to do lumpectomy so long as I agree to masectomy after chemo) so I have opted for BMX mid this year. I have just finished x 3 Taxotere and will be starting CMF tomorrow 2nd Jan x 3 rounds. Reason why I'm having CMF is because I can't have any other chemos that are 'heart' related as I've already had half the life time dose for previous Hodgkin's Lymphoma 17 years ago. CMF as my onc explains is definetely coming back 'into fashion' with lots of chemo regimes. At the moment AC is quite the go and Taxotere, however I know people that had BC 20 years ago and was treated with  CMF and they are here today to tell there story so I'm a true believer that CMF can and will work in todays 21st century. It is a lot less harmful on the body and especially the heart. When I asked my onc if this was the best treatment for me personally only having x 3 of each regime my onc said, \"Tracey, reason we are not going with FEC (E being the drug that is related to the heart) or CAF ( A being related to the heart) is because we want you to live 30+ years, if we gave you another 'heart related drug' this could cause Cardiovascular problems that you could die of, and the risks outweighing the benefits are too high\" Well that was enough for me to say yes to the CMF with no probs....lol Good luck and hope you will be going for a 2nd opinion jabal...sounds rather odd your situation with onc/ surgeon if you ask me....",

Been a busy weekend...shopping, catching up with friends and cleaning oh and more shopping! DH's birthday tomorrow so organised a cake ( will pick up before work tomorrow) . Trip all booked...going to phillip island April 7th. Booked penguin parade for that night (DS is soooooooo excited , just hope he doesn't run to grab one to take him home...lol) then booked the chocolate factory for the next day....(now I am sooooooo excited for that one) Lol!! Nihahi and Liefie, your image of working around garden with coffee made me laugh, my dad does EXACTLY the same. So proud of his garden!! He has tomatoes growing and every day I go there theres a few for me. He gets soooooooo excited, like a kid in a candy shop...lol. Nihahi, hope you are feeling ok. Like lifie said, there is no need to appologise, we can all vent on here because we all understand. It's amazing, I feel like I've known everyone here for a long time. I just wish we met on another forum. But BC brought us together and through it all, we are there for eachother , the ups and the downs of it all :) Not long for your exchange now. Bet you can't wait. I'm still waiting for my letter to come in the mail on my surgery date !! The only thing I got in the mail other than bills was a letter saying that my parking fine explanation letter ( from having chemo and it went a little longer than expected) was declined, so I have $70 to pay for that AND THEN the last chemo I had 2 weeks ago, well I received another fine in the mail so another $70. That was due to me having to see the new surgeon. So I guess that was definetely worth the fine...I can't be bothered with the letter of explanation to the council. If they declined me having a IV drip in me at the time thus I couldn't go and put money in the meter then I don't think they'll care that I had chemo and that the surgeon wanted to see me after that !! Liefie, how are you settling back in after your get away? I see your DH is a green thumb.....yes I have to agree with you, its definetely not my cup of tea when DH tells me to go to the nursery with him. I have no idea about plants. I just say yes thats pretty, yes thats nice and green, blah blah in one ear and out the other for me.!! We have palms out the front and more native plants because we were on water restrictions when we were doing our garden so we needed plants that would survive in a drought. !! Edi, you always make me smile. I was picturing you quietly going to the loo, gloves on, gloves off.....then bang, I see your photo and it summed up my vision of you with the gloves and cap on!!!! I can pull my hair now and when its wet I can come it forward or spike it....lol.....its dark brown and already growing over my ears....yipppeee hoping by the time I have surgery in May, it will be at a nice length where I can leave my wig at home, new hair style and now boobs! lol. Dakota, have you heard of 'mad monday' ? not sure if it's an 'aussie' thing but when the boys finish cricket or footy they have the Monday off and drink until there hearts content.!! I know you're sons a little young for that...lol but i hope you're giving him the day off school....lol  AND so it all begins again with soccer..... at least he plays sport to keep fit :) The girl I work with....her boyfriend had Mad Monday today after they lost the grandfinal yesterday. They had to dress up as nerds and had a pub crawl in the city. I couldn't stop laughing when my collegue showed me the photo of the 'grown men' dressed up as nerds, all colourful .. ready to take on the pubs.....it started at 9am.....I'm sure he would be in fine form tonight....lol can't wait to hear all about it at work tomorrow!! Glad things are 'ok' with the cockroach. Hope he is behaving and being nice to the kids and you ( civil enough for a conversation at the least) !! Ok, think I've blabbled enough ... lol..... catcha laters alligators.....xoxox happy Monday to you all xoxoxoxoxo",

We have a dietician at my hospital in which I'm going to make an appt with whilst I'm in hospital recovering from surgery. Think that may help with the what and what not to eat re BC etc. I think it's good that hospitals have these workers there for us to speak with. Our Breast Care nurse deals with the discussions you had with your Breast Support Team. Dakota, hope weather is good with all the sport you have on Saturday :) Edi, you make me laugh re DH closing all the doors, hasn't done it for 42 years and may have made the deaf lady next door hear you...you two are hilarious. A perfect match. You are such an inspiration Edi, full of energy, with rads and chemo and johnny , the butt crack man and DH you still manage to make everyone smile here with your wit and stories....luv ya gorgeous girl :) xx Good night from Australia gorgeous girls..may go try to get some sleep. xox Enjoy your day and will log on in the morning to see what mischief you girls got into xox",

It was an ok day today, sunny, little chill but not that bad. We went to a different park that was only built a few months back. We went on the flying fox, on the slide and of course mummy had her fun on the swing! DS and I went on this spinny thingy...well I had to tell DH to stop it before I got dizzy and fell out (yes the boys were laughing at me !!!) Nihahi, you are my inspiration. 20 years post BC and you are still a warrior til this very day inspiring us all, if it's not with your beautiful pics of nature or your courageous mountain hikes, to this....recovering from DIEP to be rid of the alien. We are all so proud of you. x I'm ok....been a bit up and down. You know when you always have BC in the back of your head. Surgery is one thing i'm a little stressed over.....but then I hear your story and Dakota recovering really well and I think, yes, that will be me, just go in there, get it done and it will be over. Then I can have my life back!! right? Liefie, how did your night of entertaining go ? Bet you were tired by the end of it ! Movie, oh how i love lamb on a spit.. we had that actually on New Years Eve. My dad loves cooking up a storm when there are people coming over. Just today actually he made my fav when I was at home, I never cook it but he did and made extra big dish to give to me. So dinner done. No cooking required tonight! Edi, cyber mommy. I think of you too. Your pics are gorgeous as always and the story about your GD and her magical stone is cute. DS sings 'Twinkle twinkle little star' to his great grandparents that he never ever knew. We were driving the other night actually when DS says, mummy, look at the stars and he said he's grandparents names and it brought a tear to my eye...actually I was an emotional wreck that day and bursted into tears.....!! Don't you just love those days you get all emotional and all you want to do is cry. Have no idea why!!! So happy that Shedman is getting there. God bless him too. Dakota, yeh next step nipples. ;) I'm looking on the internet and I'm liking the 3D tattoos. My BS was telling me at her other hospital where she treats private patients, the BC Nurse actually does them...so she is going to get the details for that.  Hope you are not too busy at work ! Scottiee, how you doing ? hope you keeping busy but relaxing at the same time!! Caitlin, sorry to hear you've been experiencing tingling/numbness in the fingers. Unfortunately mine has gotten worse. It has it's good days and bad days. I hate waking up in the middle of the night with severe pain. My onc and GP didn't mention Vit B and didn't know about that . My GP however mentioned Vit C because he had major surgery on his arm last year and has been taking Vit C daily and hasn't had much neuropathy he says by taking that. I'm going to go and see the pharmasist tomorrow to see what they recommend.  Maria and Alive, thinking of you and hoping things are getting better with your decisions. Check in when you get a chance to let us know you're ok. All you other gorgeous girls out there, thinking of you. Take care and enjoy your day / night xx",

Keep up the great work girl :) Edi, love the pics, the last one is great :)  Your GD sounds just like DS....cheeky !! He DIDN\"T have any chips for breakfast...lol I got him in time !! He did have chips at the party today. He had a great time and so did I!! No I wasn't allowed on the jumping castle but I did manage to get into the big slide (lucky butt didn't get left behind) Lol I told you, I'm a little girl at heart !! Dragged DH along. My cousins daughter was invited to party also...so we got my cousins DH to come as well......well.....we were wondering where the 2 'boys' were...we found them in the 3 year old area throwing the balls at each other......well at least they were in the area of their 'brain age group' lol......then we went back to their place for some dinner it was a great day. Iceburg, keep up with that great positive attitude , You said it girl \"This waiting is the worst, I just want to know what I am dealing with so I can fight this battle, I am ready to get started!  \" and you know that we will be right there with you in your pockets Jennie, How are you going ? Alive4five, how are you feeling ? Websister, you are allowed to rant. You are allowed to do and say ANYTHING on here. You are my inspiration and you are a patient person. We are all there in the meadow with you x How did your visit with mom go today? Is she getting better ? Movie, you know that I will come along and help Edi with your luggage ok!! We promise to keep quiet !! Staycalm (well your name says it all) !! Welcome to the place no one wants to be, but we are here and we are here for eachother. We welcomed Iceburg to our little family here yesterday. The waiting is the HARDEST and once you speak with your onc it will all start making sense and then a treatment plan can take place. Try keeping off Dr Google, statistics are outdated. These boards are full of wonderful information and ladies that are going through exactly what you are going through. Breath in and out, take one day at a time. Vent on here. Go outside, scream, shout and cry. We all have !! Just remember, there are so many treatments out there now . You got this girl. Stay positive I'm not going to say 'don't worry' because I know that we all do. You have come to the right place and we are glad you have found us. Keep us posted Dakota, how was the concert......?? Did you have fun ? Nihahi, you're not going hiking this weekend are you ? Jennie, hope you've been well. Caitlin, so what are you and your mommy getting up to this weekend ? Hope you all enjoy your day xx",

Long list and scary list of Taxotere I tell you but I guess many others have been through it so I'm sure i can too! They say Salt Water helps with the ulcers.....don't think so much with the fluffy tongue though...lol. Nails are sore I haven't touched them manicure wise, though I have clear nailpolish on it, a good Sally Hansen one to make them stronger to 'hopefully' stop them from peeling and lifting! I'm going to ice my mouth next treatment and also thinking of doing my toes and fingernails...I've seen on other  boards that they do this so I may give it a try ( if my ice gets there as 'ice' as I have just over an hour drive to the hospital )!! I was scared, more cautious re post op .... cuts, burns, picking up my son who knew mummy had a 'sore' but just wanted to be cuddled but we still managed lots of cuddles on the couch. The more I worried about things the worse I was.....I cut my finger while cutting up the veggies one night....it was ok, it healed well but I'm a ditz when it comes to that!  Now I've got numbness but not that it bothers me....its mainly under my arm pit so not all that noticeable..only when I go to touch it and i'm like oh..... I can't feel there! Well I didn't win on the races, BBQ was good though :) Thank god I still have my taste buds !! Dessert was yummy...yes I did endulge, but we are women, we can endulge right...right ?? lol of course we can :)            There's still a chance to win tonight, we have a AUD100 mill lotto draw tonight......got my tickets on for that too.....hmmm I'm not a gambler.....I'm not , honestly....ha ha !! Bearcub, it is nice having you ladies to chat to all over the world :) I'm in Melbourne, I've been to Sydney a few times (not as nice as Melbourne ) ha ha ! Carla, you are not alone hun...this is the worst part of it all, not knowing but once you have a plan in place then its all go from there....first things first.......meeting with your doctor to see if it is anything and if it is.....next course of action. You have come to the right place, I've learnt so many things from these ladies and everyone is so helpful I too found my lump 3 weeks before my scheduled mammogram. An ultrasound was then followed straight away when I could tell by the look of the radiographer that it was cancer......everything seemed to fall into place from there and was just go go go.....! Wish you all the best and keep us posted Carla  Take care ladies and enjoy your day :)",

Taxotere I had them 8mgs x twice a day for 1 day prior to chemo, then on day of chemo and day after chemo....this time round with this regime I only need to have the steroids in the IV drip as does Edi and then I don't have to take them after as the regime I'm going to be on now doesn't really have a reaction. My worst meltdown is really coming off the steriods , so Day 3-5 are my worst days, my hubby doesn't even know what to say or do because I just really 'go off at him' for the tiniest thing.....I just can't help myself, I tell him to snap me out of it but I guess its the DRUGS that are doing it to us.......don't stress too much, anxiety, meltdowns, highs and lows are all part of it......you will get through it just like we all will and you'll get back to that positive you, it might not seem so at the time, but you do.",

Bread was yummy Nihahi, I could do another couple of slices with that bacon and eggs, though I could do a Chocolate Long john right about now for mid arvo snack!! Carlads, hope you had a nap too and you are doing ok. Lol, Websister, I don't think Kenny would appreciate photos up here of him......you definetely wouldn't win 'mum of the year' lol......glad your mum will be back at the lodge soon, kenny will be up and running and you can concentrate on moving forward again as you are and continue to do :) Edi, any orders for cakes this week or you taking it easy ? Worked out well that the plumbers didn't come to do up your new bathroom .... I'm hoping today is better and you are having a great dream in sleepy land right now :) Well i'm going to do some house work before venturing out for dinner with DH DS, my cousin and her DH & DD....off to the pub  Hope you are all having an eventful day xx",

Well I'm feeling quite fine since my 2nd treatment on Wednesday, tongues funny, but not AS furry this time..lol I listened re the lemon drops...I iced my hands WITH GLOVES....I can't believe a lady whom was having Taxotere a few years back heard about all this icing etc and she bought them and told the nurses to keep them on the ward incase someone needed them as she no longer required them as they done the job for her...so now I get to use them.......:) So as I was sitting there for treatment, I froze away but it was good...no pain this time on my nail beds...... now only if I tried those cooling caps...lols , don't honestly think I'd have the patience with them ... as soon as I put the gloves on it was like I had a itch on my nose, itch on my cheek, itch everywhere just when you know you shouldn't be getting your hands out...lols..so if i had the cap on my head god only knows I'd be scratching away..... Day 24 and hair is there, but not if you know what i mean....I had a knot in it yesterday morning and i tried slowly combing it out with a large wide comb...yeh right, so instead yanked it out, the quicker this is over the better with the hair coming out I tell you.....I bought 2 cotton night caps and day caps,, hubby thinks I look like a sexy gypsy...lol... Dakota, I didn't realise you were close to Edi and I also..... Liefie, thanks for clarifying that i'm normal re those pains from Taxotere, this drug sure is a bitch....my hands are peeling so when people look at my hands I tell them dry skin too much water...lol they look at you like you're a freak.....lol Have fun in Seattle......you cheerleader you...hope you're wearing your little ra ra skirt ready to shake and cheer :) Well Im just a little tired but other than that, usual shopping etc......it's going to be really hot here down under tomorrow so I'm going to try staying indoors, my son wants to go to my auntys in the pool so may let him go there with mum while I just chillax and finish my Christmas cake that I'm making ..... lol Hope you all had a great day at your Thanks Giving Celebrations.......

Have you still got your eyebrows/lashes?? Mine still there, just dont want to jinx them...hair on my head one thing gone, accepted it and moved on ... but I don't want to go down the path again of drawing on eyebrows...getting them right was a pain in the butt for me....lol I've still got hair, length is slowly going but the top is sorta all over the place, i love when I have knots and i go to comb them out gently then boom.....gone the whole knot and all....may as well have gotten the scissors...but I have days no shedding at all or very minimal..... Are you going to be on CMF too after this lot ?? I've heard hair can grow back too but have just said to myself, well the hair will come back when it comes back....be after March when I finish chemo or during treatment will be an added bonus for winter here...lol 'tis what it is' I guess..... You dh is definetly a darling....... sounds sexy with the 40s look happening.....:) I'm so proud of you having fun with your wigs.....I wish I was closer so we could 'fun this whole thing out together' lol. My cousin is doing the make up for Britains next top model.... I need to go and visit her when all this is done and I'm back on track....... I hear London is beautiful As for toilet training, hmmm my DS is ready for night time but because its hot he wants to drink lots at night after running around so much that I don't want to train while he'll be waking up every 5 mins for the loo.....lol...mummy needs her beauty sleep more than before and its bad enough I'm an insomniac now I think........

It doesn't matter how long I hold my fingers to compress the site it still turns out bruised most chemoss....oh and the chemo ward is using different adhesive strips now and guess whos allergic to it!!!!! I ended up with a nice round red mark in the middle of my arm, should have drawn a face on it or something !!! Now I've marks on my arm ( oh and burnt it the other day straighting my wig) that I have a burn mark to add to it.....I seriously look like a junkie....lol...... I know you mentioned that your onc said that your body may not be able to handle chemo, however CMF is actually tolerable....I have had nil side effects ( sorry other than half hour nausea, well more like an upset tummy, how you feel when you are hungry and haven't eaten, that kinda 'upset' and Ive had no nausea meds so far) I know every one reacts differently but majority on the CMF board have had very minimal SE's and they too have positive nodes like us.....worth discussing in my opinion . Glad you watched heartland.....now hope you will have a little nap and perhaps something to eat. I'm sure the blood was something that you've torn considering you've had severe diarrhea...I wish I was closer to come and help you......",

What the cockroach is due home already.....hmmm make sure you tell him we all said Hi....NOT.....oh he makes me angry because you are such a beautiful person on the inside and out and your kids sound the same as their mummy ( just as well they take after you )!! Now you just have to be strong when he does decide to walk into that door..(hmm if only he walked INTO the door and not open it) oh no my being bad now...shhh no more from me on that so called DH!! Enjoy your sleep over....sounds like lots of fun. Well we went to the festival in my town today. It was fun. DS was in his element seeing the fireworks, and before that the fire trucks and firemen/women parade down the street (waving madly to them) they all looked buggered as there was another fire not too far from us again today, it was contained, but still so inconvenient. I didn't tell you ladies, the 2400 hectares that took off last week too close to home, well it was DELIBERATLY lit by a 48 year old man.!! can you believe it....deliberate and putting fireys lives in danger! I'm so glad he was caught, now he has been suspected for lots of other fires that were deliberatly lit....hope they lock him up and throw away the key!! Enjoy your saturday all....off to bed here.....1am already! hugs to you all xx",

I don't know how you still have energy for dragging DH out to get things for the 2 spare rooms.....lol you forgot about them !! inbetween the loo, the bedrooms and the plumbers cracks, I'm sure you've forgotten about them! Hope you're having a productive day. Your bedroom looks gorgeous, and your GD is just adorable on that horse. Now I know where you get your gorgeous looks from, your pretty mummy :) Movie, hope you've had a great day Liefie, hope you having fun at your 'sleepover' ..... Websister, good to hear life is busy and that you are getting along with your rads. Enjoy Sunday out with your mum. Hopefully she won't need the wheel chair, but if thats her 'safety zone' so long as she is happy, thats the main thing I guess. Benny, good to hear from you gorgeous girl. We all have our 'dark places' and trust me I've been there quite a few times.....you have and are doing everything to get through all of this. Before you know it, this will be in the past and we can look forward to the tomorrow. Dakota honey, hockey, soccer.....hope the weathers good for you to get out and about. Hows that cockroach going ? Is your DS and DD ok? Luvmy, 'baby watch' sounds like fun....make sure you post pics of the little 'kids' !! how adorable, something to look forward to. Nihahi, your walk sounded gorgeous...glad the sky is blue. Its going to be a warm week again this week. No wonder I can't shake off this cold..( now that I've had CMF I also feel that sinus like cold thing that goes on..lol do you like my description?, bit like the way I'm feeling....crazy! ) the weather is hot one day, cold the next. So pool week again this week, not bad for the first week of Autumn! Scottiee, sounds like your DS is under control. I'm sure there is nothing to worry about. Boys will be boys.. Forgetful, selective hearing....they are all the same. I send my DH off to the shops with a little list of bits and pieces ( 4 things max) and he STILL calls me to ask a question.....lol Caitlin, Carlads, Bevlee, Keemo, and anyone else I may have missed,  hope you are all well. So whos having chemo next week ? Edi and I are on shift, Tues for Edi and Weds LAST ONE for MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!  (sorry just a tad excited, can you tell !!!!!!!!)

There is a beautiful restaurant here and every weds and thurs nights they have half price on some of the menu....its amazing and so much cheaper (derr half price! lol) and a good night out to break up the week with the family. Wontons sounds yummy, must try that this Thursday, having early Easter dinner with my cousin and her family as this Easter hubby is on call so kids can open there presents. So glad you are feeling better and eating more. Your story of your friends wedding night just as funny as yours and Nihahis with her DH walking around with a bandaid mark....lol  too funny (well now we can laugh about them) .....I'm laughing out loud DH said what are you laughing about...I just said oh these girls make me laugh!! Poor lady vomiting though, oh dear! I'm glad you have Sergei now that can be with you all day long and not complain about a thing!! You have a very sweet sweet man Edi. Nihahi, sorry to hear about DD and DS...hope like Edi says hope they get sorted and quickly and prognosis not too bad. Scottiee, welcome back you sound soooooo refreshed, well done :) sounds like a perfect getaway with all you girls laughing and relaxing !! Glad you brought back that turkey with you...it's amazing isn't it buying direct from wholesaler....if only you opened up a health food shop, competition goes so far. The town I grew up in ( and still live in) was like a little farm town back in the day, now it is so over populated with new areas developing all the time. We only had one of everything, now there is so much competition that the 'oldies' that were here before like the owner of the chemist, perfect example, has to lower prices as he can't compete otherwise and he isn't liking it as loosing biz!! Websister, how nice, seeing mum tomorrow, glad to hear she is doing well...hope she is getting out of her room and enjoying the sunshine!! So excited for you, now that you have finished rads then off for a week to visit DS and family. How old is your grandchild(children) ? Enjoy your time with them...:) Lifie, did you see Nemo ??? I love clown fishies..they are gorgeous. My DS's first b'days theme was Nemo! It is a whole new world under the sea....( I did enjoy it before I hit that coral )!! Home time already..wow how quick that has gone.... you sound like you had lots of adventurous moments.....so happy you got away and relaxed, and that DH did too....!! Dakota, hope tournament going well and you are having lots of fun hun x Luvmy, have fun with DD coming over , I still want to see the little goaties.....I might pop passed tomorrow to visit ! lol Well, off to bed soon, had yummy dinner at pub tonight with family. Its raining here girls, and it sounds gorgeous. Should have a nice sleep tonight, got my winter pjs on ... so nice and comfy :) xx night night from me to you my gorgeous sisters xx",

Its nice to finish chemo but now another waiting game until I receive a confirmed date for surgery. Well April will be a little family trip to look forward to so I'm excited for that. Easter next week 4 days off .... 4 days of eating chocolate....lol ( like I need Easter to eat chocky...its just a good excuse!!) DH is not letting me go when i drop him off at kindy ( pre-school) he cries and then I have to sneak out.  I wait a little then leave because the teachers he has are fantastic with him and get him distracted before he knows it...... its hard because he loves to go there enjoys him self its just letting mummy go . Today mum and I went shopping and had breaky at a cafe. It was really nice. tomorrow is work day.....never mind, thats my 'relaxation therapy' !!

Carla, Caitlin, thinking of you today, minimal SEs. Carla, I sooooooooooooo get you about putting on those few extra kilos ( pounds as you yanks say)!! I put on almost 10kgs during chemo.... I blame the steriods!! As my onc says, best to put the weight on then to loose weight by 'chucking' all the time. (oh how blessed I feel!!!!)  I feel like a 5 foot nothing oompa loompa, paint me orange and there you'll have one!!! The Easter Eggs don't help either!! I just hope that I won't be putting on weight with Tamoxifen or i'm in real trouble...lol.! Liefie, how do you feel today? Hope you managed to pick up those chick peas to finish your hummus....personally not a fan of chick peas...think because my nanna use to put them in her winter soup .... but I'm sure yours would be better :) Take care ladies, DS must of heard me clicking away here and of course is up....yeh for me.....lol let the fun begin.!

You deserve it. Good luck with the recon decision... Movie, how long did you take to heal from DIEP ? I was thinking that but am going for the 'quick recovery' with implants ( no TE's for me, there's enough skin here for them to cut off and make 2 x c cup boobies just from my one...lol) Dakota, how good is it that they caught the A holes that arranged the Boston Bombings....I hope things are settling and getting back to normal over there. Has DS recovered from being sick ? Hope not too much sports this weekend for you so you can relax !! Websister enjoy your day running around being busy :) (not that that's anything different for you! ha ha) Bearcub/Benny/Jennie and anyone else I may have missed as brain is a little slow at 1am....lol.....enjoy your day/night xo I'm off to bed now, hopefully I get some sleep tonight !!",

Luvmy, I think anyone with tomotoes growing here in there back yards would have had them blown away for tomatoe sauce its that windy today......I went and picked up DS and the wind was pushing me to his classroom !! (lucky I've got this extra weight on me to hold me down!! thought I was going to be Mary Poppins without the umbrella!) Websister, I actually phoned my onc today. For the peace of mind as I was literally going out of my mind with anxiety and worry. He said sciatica sounds very clear on the butt/ thigh pain. He said even without the bum pain I can get the lower back and thigh pain. With regards to my headache, swollan gland and congestion, sounds all too familiar of sinus. I am however booked in to see my GP this evening so he can just check me over and if antibiotics is recommended I can start on that. Onc said that because we have all this 'poison' or bodies can do 'crazy' things after we finish with tx. he did ease my mind a little. I asked if scans were necessary as I am going in for my liver scan on the 9th May and he said no. I asked re blood work to be done and he said 'no' . never the less I am going to get my blood work checked, the standard chemo ones they do and see if my liver works back in action after the CMF stuff! The reason I phoned my onc also was to see if i should have another Zoladex injection as I stopped last month being my last one before surgery. However because Surgery is not scheduled for min 2 weeks ( he told me I get 2 week minimum notice!!) that I should start Tamoxifen. SE's sound like they are the same as Zoladex , hot flushes etc but I'm still in two states of mind starting it, do I don't I !! arghhhhh decisions. He told me to start it and we can re-evaluate in my appt with him in June. I really hope your back gets better before next Thursday so you won't have anything to talk with MO for....fingers crossed for you. DS enjoyed grandparents dropping him off this morning, my dad was so happy that Zac gave him lots of kisses and cuddles as they were leaving , he does that with my mum all the time. Mum and I went to pick him up and he ran straight to his nanna....(yeh thanks DS, don't worry about your DM)!! lol. Will have some me time now and watch a bit of tv. House is clean, laundry is done. and DS having a snooze !! love to all x",

Websister, Websister, I am praying on overtime for you that your scan results are ok. Surely the MO wouldn't let you wait until Friday next week for results, one week! My mind would be going crazy in overtime. Just like me phoning for my liver results. I knew my Liver doc doesn't like giving results good or bad over the phone so I bypassed him and went straight to my BC nurse that I have a good relationship with..... she still needed to ask for permission but there was no way I was going to wait 2 weeks for the results. Can't you put yourself out of much un needed stress and ask someone for results ??

I'm off to bed shortly, just after midnight, should get some sleep ( still averaging 5 hours if not less) . Going to speak to someone tomorrow about lymphatic massage. Seems that my right arm where the lymph nodes were removed swells with the heat (we've only had a couple of really hot days) and I can tell the difference. Not happy! so will see if massage works because no matter how much 'excercise' I'm giving my lymphatic system myself. It just comes back swollen :( xxx",

Glad to hear you've slept and feel a little better. Metal taste lingers so take lemon drops as Edi had suggested to me and try gargling salt and water ... to hopefully try to avoid mouth ulcers . Liefie, I did that too....sitting on the chair relaxing about to get my first 'hit' of my drug and I'm like mind over matter, kill kill kill .... go everywhere and kill kill any left over so and so's there is !! ( I use to say that in the radiation machine in 1997! ) Bearcub, DH does have a great sense of humour, lucky  I know after all these years how to take him because he is a hoot at times :) Edi, I need the hoover at work with me today; whats annoying the crap out of me is those strands of hair that get caught in your top on your back.....It's not like I can just take off my top and pluck away at those strands of hair ...arghhhhhhh !! I'm the only one to answer phones and I can't be running to the loo to take off my top..... oh my, if it's not one thing running to the for it's loo, ...lol gotta laugh it off while I sit here with a ruler scratching my back and making sure that my hairs not in the way so I don't tug at that !!! Sleep well fellow warriors while I sit here for another hour itching, can't wait to get home and pluck these hairs from my top.....",

I wanted to scream, I cried I cried I said no more of this crap...I felt good before it all, got through surgery and all and now chemo is making me sick......but you know what, there really is light at the end of the tunnel....day 7 was a turn around...I felt normal.....I still do (except for the hair and dry hands) but you do get through this stage....I'm emotionally preparing myself again for 2nd round on Wednesday.... you can do this do not give up. I probably wouldn't suggest Apple Juice because it can give you the runs to the loo.....probably best to stick to water and cordial......thats what I've been living on and the food, well I eat anything and everything. Juice in moderation to avoid having mouth ulcers, well its unavoidable at times but it may hurt them if they are on there way! Not too much Saltines incase it constipates you....if it's not one thing its another but you will get through this. We have gatorade here, I don't like it all that much but cordial on the other hand yummy.....I think I have all flavours in the cupboard :) Just like Edi said, though I have 5 more chemos all up and then no rads for me only because I can't have any more as I had in the passed.....next summer we will be here showing off our new locks and you'll be showing us new photos of you and Diamond. Hope you have minimal SE's today and have a good sleep , you are a warrior, a fighter if we can do it so can you hun... Edi, my hair is driving me mad..I actually just want it to hurry up and get lost because waking up to hair everywhere and trying to wash what I have, I can't even comb it without it all coming out....driving me crazIER! LOL I'm going out with my cap on today, its really nice just because I'm so vain with my hair...lol I will cover up the top as its thinning and I'm not liking this new do...don't want to put my wig on because I don't want to sit there plucking out damn hair in the wig cap all night long.....(I'd rather do it in a $10 cap then a $315 wig!! I'm glad you had a great arvo with the GD and her mummy.... My son is too cute I must admit...this morning he saw me doing my hair and said no mum hair coming out..I said I know but I want it to come out now because its doing my head in......lol and he said oh ok mum......( looking rather odd at me) !!

When I use to have chemo back in 1996, I had to have these injections EVERY DAY...its good to see how far they've come by only now requiring the one shot 24 hours after chemo :) So long as it keeps working for us thats the main thing :) I also was reading about the lowered dosage of Taxotere having much less side effects then the full dosage and thought of your straight away.....I'm hoping you don't have to but if your onc recommends i would definetely go with that hun....you might get a few extra but the dosage would be smaller and more managable.

I had a good sleep in too after the steam train left for work :) Funny you mention that the dietician mentioned to limit to 2 servings of soy a day, I asked my BS about soy when I was 'googling' diets etc re BC and she said that there is not enough data to state that soy should or shouldn't be eaten however if I don't eat it anyway don't start and because majority of our food additives have soy, that is ok as they are 'synthetic' not 'real' soy if you know what i mean.....its all too confusing.... I'm glad you got food into you today . Good that Di behaved, perhaps it was the carrots but who cares, Di behaved and the others acted like donkeys...lol Carla, hope you are all ok hun. Caitlin, good re second opinion....makes your mind wonder on different onc's opinions on the matter.....I think its the best option considering all the other factors you need to take into consideration.  My onc took it upon himself to get lots of different opinions about the chemo regime's he was going to give me, he even phoned the UK and the USA onc's to discuss my 'rare ' condition as I got BC from mantle radiation that I had 16 years ago so there were some saying masectomy with rads only and others saying chemo with rads and lumpectomy, some with masectomy, chemo and rads....I just said I don't want rads, I know its different now a days then before but I HATED rads and prefered chemo back then AND I WANT a BMX not just the one ..... so the regime I'm on now does not effect the heart because I have already had half the life time amount of that particular drug! Its all too confusing but hopefully now you will have your plan of attack and be on the road again to kick C's butt.:) Edi, how did your grocery shopping go and your wallpaper shopping for your bedroom go ?

Apart from waiting 3 hours for my drugs to come up it went nice and smoothly.....cycle 2 out of 3 started. Next wednesday more chemo then break.....ahhh. My onc is SO HAPPY with the way i'm going and can't believe i'm still smiling, chirpy and cheeky...lol (not me cheeky!!) Lifie, Good news .... fantastic hun I'm not one for fish with bones...I get my husband to take EVERY bone out of the fish if we have flatheads, they are so yummy, he tells me he's ruining a good fish cleaning it for me and my DS but I tell him I like them looking like Fish chippies....lol....I made flake for my son yesterday (gummy shark) and my DH and I had garlic scallops and prawns on a bed of steamed rice with vegetables on the side....mmmm went down nicely...lol. Bearcub, sorry to hear you're coming down with a cold....no wonder with the weather we are all getting lately, today is 27 degrees and hot, tomorrow 27 degrees with rain forecasted and for the remainder of the week :( Weather ok here Nihahi ... you are so cute worrying. the floods are in QLD....Bevlee and I are away from the fire and floods ( go figure, my state is on fire in some parts and up northin in QLD have floods) got to love Australia!!! I've done 2 lots of my lymphodema excercises....it really does work...i can't believe after doing the excercises the fluid drains out of my hand bit and into the lymphatic system, though it comes back if i do repeatative moves.....so no vacuuming, mopping, typing things like that...( yeh right, things a women just can't live without doing hey !!) I wanted to see my gorgeous BS today but she wasn't in so i'm going to send her an email with her recommendations. They told me if i go to a different hospital then i will have to pay but if i stay at mine i won't have to pay, so at this stage I'm going to enquire about Plastic Surgeons from her and pricing. My parents and husband have already said that money's no option so long as i'm comfortable with my PS and I get my pirky boobies I'm happy with then go for which ever one I want.......guess I'll wait to see what my BS suggests or recommends....she'll tell me straight out :) Well off to wake DS up so when my DH comes home we are ready to head off to my parents house for dinner (gotta love not cooking ) !!! Take care all....Edi, I hope your chemo went ok today, I know its 6am where you are...I'm sure you'll be down to make a cuppa soon before DH gets up......lol Still no word on benny...well hoping her internet is just down and not her ! Carlads, how you going today hun ? Bevlee, can't believe your 'so called friend' said that ... how horrible...ummm helllooooo you are probably doing better then him and you're on chemo...! I get that too, 'oh poor thing you're on chemo, look how young you are'!! yeh right, I'm young but I'm still more active than you are with no chemo I say under my breath...gotta love those people that are so draining...I got rid of all the 'draining' people in my life....i lift their spirits more than they lift mine....lol. Even the nurses said to me today ' why are you so cheery, you're having chemo ' my reply' well of course I'm cheery, I may be having chemo, but this is one step closer to the end of the chemo journey' they just looked at me and said ' well if only half the chemo patients had your attitude' ! Well enjoy your day / evening everyone...will be back on later to check out if any updates xxx",
