It is from my port (never has worked from the get go) The good that came out of that was I got to see my oncologist two days early and they left me have my LAST chemo treatmen yesterday. How cool is that? NO more chemo. sweet. Hy hairless days are numbered. I just have to get through the last 10 days of SE's for me and watch my blood while I am on blood thinners. I have to plan my surgery now but I think I am going for the double instead of a lumpectomy. I sure don't want to go through this again. I am sorry to hear some of you are going through lympedema. I am concerned about that as well since they had to use the vein in my right arm and that was the SNB arm but they couldn't use the left where the port is because of the clot. Are we having fun yet? Take care ladies and sleep well tonight. Penny",

I finished chemo the end of Jan, had my bilateral with free tram flap done March 22nd and now in radiation (#5 of 25 today) I am healing from surgery but it takes a while. I feel good in the morning and then evenings get me. I am disappointed in the growth of my hair on my head. It seems to be growing very slow. I lost all eyebrows and eyelashes after last chemo and even the peach fuzz on my face fell out. Now the hair is growing so fast every where but my head. I stopped wearing all head gear this past Monday, it was just to uncomfortable. I decided it didn't matter what others thought, I didn't ask for this cancer. It has been nice catching up on how everyone is doing. Good to know things are looking up. Take care and have a wonderful weekend! Penny",

My hair is straight and still only about half inch long. It won't lay down either, it sticks straight up. I tried to goop it down but that didn't even put a dent in it. Guess I need super glue. Not sure what is going to happen with it, strange for sure. Still no eyelashes to speak of either. I hope everyone has a great Memorial weekend. Penny",

My daughter wants to come help me out when I get home from the hospital so that will be nice.

I was diagnosed 9/26/07 had all the tests done in 3 weeks, port put in on 10/08/07 along with the SNB. I have IDC grade 3, stage 2b. One of the two sentinal nodes was positive, the remaining 25 nodes removed were also negative for cancer. yay My first chemo was 10/19/07. I also went in to the hair place right after chemo and cut my hair off. I knew I wouldn't be able handle it falling out in clumps. I must say either it was the chemo or the neulasta shot that kicked my butt. All I have wanted to do is sleep for the last 6 days. Today I actually feel more human but have so many aches that I didn't have before chemo started. I got the sore throat which was no fun. That is finally getting better today, still a little raw. I am glad I found this board. I am looking forward to chatting with everyone and getting to know you. Thanks in advance for help and information. Penny",

Has anyones taste buds been changed by chemo and how long did it last. Everything tastes funny to me and even mustard feels like it burns my tongue. I am nervous for session #2 after being so tired from the first one. I didn't realize the back pains were from neulasta either. Alishar, you dh sounds like mine, he bought me two wigs and wants to go and get a couple more. This time different colors, I am normally blonde.  How many of you go out without any head coverings after your hair fall outs? Thanks, Penny",

I shaved my head the day of my first chemo treatment. Mine has thinned but not completely fallen out. I still have eyebrows and eyelashes but almost no pubic hair. Interesting how we all lose hair differently. 2nd chemo tx for me is this Friday. I go to the endocronologist today to see if there is something they can do for my thyroid. Sure would be nice to come out on the other side of all this next spring, have everything working correctly and feel like a new woman. I won't know what to do with myself.",

I am not looking forward to round two of chemo. About how long after you started chemo did your hair go? Guess now would be a good time to stop the surgar so I don't break out. Any other info I would appreciate. Thanks, Penny",

Unfortunately I am 6 months out of radiation and I still have the swelling in hands, feet and upper arms. I do know from the doctors my heart came through the chemo drugs doing good and that I don't have lymphadema. SO for me I guess it is just going to take time. NOt really what I want to hear. They did put me on a blood pressure medicine with a water pill in it but that doesn't really seem to help. I am getting really discouraged. Penny",

She thinks it is also odd that I have swelling in both arms, in fact the left is more swollen then the right and it was the right side that had the lymph nodes removed. I know this is temporary, at least I am hoping it is. I will do what I can and that is eat right and exercise. I'll keep going to the doctors until they find something. I am just tired of seeing doctors. I haven't had more then a week since this all started that I haven't had a doctor visit of some kind. Oh well, I haven't given up yet. I was diagnosed with osteopenia so maybe that explains the bone pain at least, but not the swelling. Thanks for your kind thougths ladies. Penny",
