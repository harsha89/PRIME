Other forums, mainstream info, everywhere. Please feel free link this to other discussion groups and forums  The cancer is a terrible thing to have but managing it was not that difficult, quality life CAN BE possible when you have ALL the info.  I am in Hospice now with her and I DO NOT want anyone else have to suffer as we are now from what I can only think was missed info. What IF they did one last September, what would they have found? Nothing? I don't know.  The one done two weeks ago? MAYBE we could have started whole brain radiation and she could have had some quality time ... I DON'T KNOW Is it possible that in ONE WEEK this had spread so rapidly??? Again, I do not know  I just DO NOT want anyone else to have a giant surprise like this thrust upon them and not having any options ... ",
