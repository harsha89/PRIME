I am a redhead and fair skinned as well, and I did not get any burns at all. Maybe it depends on the actual time our skin is being radiated, may be worth asking that question if you are scheduled for radiation. I had 25 regular zaps, lasting about 8 seconds from the left angle, and about 18 seconds from the right angle, then I had 8 days of boosts, forgot to time them, but they did not seem very long, and I never did get burned. The RO gave me aloe Vera to use, and I used it 3-4 times a day during and even after radiation was done. Best of luck to you dsgirl",

I have been under the weather and had to stop the treatments for a while, am now better and had # 23 yesterday. The center was all decorated and everyone was in costume, they gave out delish. pumpkin decorated sugar cookes, hugs all around, it really it great to have a center with compasionate and friendly techs. Look like my last day now will be november 12th instead of november 4th. Darn it. I had an emotional/physical breakdown, ended up in the hospital because I also had an abmormal ekg, my biggest problem was actually pain in my leg, it turned out to be a sciatic nerve pinch. But oh, the heart gets better treatment than a darn leg, like one nurse said, it seems to be the most important part to check first, Seems to me I was breezing thru this, diag. june, surg. july, rads start end of sept, almost done, doing good, driving myself, shopping, picnicing, visiting, but never really ever during these months have I dealt with the fact the I have cancer, I just pretended it was not there, and did not deal with it.  Oh yeah, doing fine, it's a breeze, in out the rad center 8 min flat and so on. When I was driving I never noticed how tense I sat at the wheel (hubby was gonna take me, but after the first 2 days I decided I hated to sit there and do nothing and I would drive myself. 150 miles round trip.  I was tense on the radiation table, I was tense everywhere I went and during anything I did since june and my body finally decided to tell me to stop that nonsense. After the lst week of rads I have only been able to sleep 3 hrs per nite, decided to take a nap after rads then and could not sleep at all at nite by week 4. Appetite plummetting,  Start of week 5 sciatic nerve put me in such an intense pain I could not stop shaking, got arm and chest pain as well and my husband took me to emergency, when my ekg was abnormal, I have a coronary stent implant, so I was sent to then hospital where my heart doc is, and after 2 days he declared heart still working good. Howver the leg pain was a diff. matter, heat and pain meds did not help at all, I usually vomit when given narcotics so they don't get a chance to work on my pain, really my leg had  the most pain than I have ever experienced. Finally found a combination of nausea med/ pain med that made it bearable, but still no sleep, and leg pain was eased somewhat by walking only. My primary talked about xray mri and cortizone shots, when my daughter mentioned a Chiropractor, I thought why not. First think he said was no heat ever, ice every 20 min, off 1 hr and try to rest the leg, he did an xray and showed me where my back was out of line, excactly where the siatic nerve starts, and I had my first adjustment wednesday, another one on friday, and I am finally on the mend. I will probably see the chiro 2-3 times more, I have osteoporosis, so the ajdustments have to be moderated a little, but they give me no pain what so ever. The pain in the leg comes and goes, but I manage it now that it is not so intense. I had a big pity party for one (me) and cried alot, gads that felt real good afterwards, and I then realized I never even cried once since I was diagnosed way back in June. My primary doc has now prescribed ativan and I slept from midnight to 6 am - and have taken several little 30 min naps during today, and feel so much better. So now my husband is driving me every day, I either work a cross word puzzle, put the back of the seat down and rest, play a handheld game, listen to the radio or tapes, and do feel more relaxed that I have in 5 month. So hopefully I will be done with cancer treatments Nov 12, which means I spanned, Sept. Oct. Nov Rads. I think my skin liked the break from Rads, look normal, but feel like leather, I am gonna ask if I need something else, am still just using pure aloe as instructed, missed the red wine for 2 weeks, darn, but pain meds warms to not drink alchohol, so I didnt. Havent taken any pain meds today, so look out, tonite a samll glass of red wine. Anyway I am glad to be back and will now read some of the boards. dsgirl",

I had # 7 treatment today. I was also given alove vera, and was told to use it on all the area being radiated, 2-3 times a day or as I felt I needed it, but DO NOT USE 3 hrs before treatment. Very important. One day I applied it in the dressing room after treatment, and that was not a  good idea. When I got home my cotton undershirt stuck to me and I was afraid to just pull it off, thinking skin would come off with it, so I went in the shower and it came right off. Now I apply it after I get home, and again before bed. I make sure it dries well every time. I am out of the shower at 7am, I apply the aloe vera, get the blow dryer and dry my hair with me head down, and by the time my hair is dry the aloe vera usually is too, if not I guess I could use the hairdryer ?  Havent tried that yet. I am 68 and can tell you that under the breast is the hardest part to get good and dry for me, but bending down to dry my hair definitely helps. I suggest you always checking all over your breast for any folds that are not completely dry. My treatment is at 10:30, so I end up applying the aloe vera 3 1/2 hrs before radiation. I think it has helped me not getting burned yet, I do have some swelling but that's another problem not caused by radiation. Good luck tomorrow, I am sure you will do fine. dsgirl",

As far a being emotional, thats ok, I think that is what these boards are for too, Lisa. Let it all hang out, but your husband is right, after venting focus on the 70%. And remember those are just stats. I read with interest (and a certain feeling of doom too) the posts about carbs, I am a sugar junkie, 2 teaspoons in coffee and tea, so if sugar is not a good thing during rads I just have to do without  my coffee in the morning, and then I am not a happy camper. Believe me I have tried no sugar, splenda, saccharin, and so on and after a week or so I just decide not to drink the stuff, yet of course I really like and need my coffee with breakfast but it has to have that sugar. I guess tomorrow I will ask at that question of the techs. Boy I hope they call me if the machine is down, hate to drive so far for nothing.

Seems like I am being well taken care of there, if the x-ray shows a change in area to be radiated from last week, (it can be due to swelling, or swelling that was there going down, the area to be treated changes), so always at least one x-ray per week, and then sometimes more if needed. I still have fairly normal looking skin, but doc warned me it will probably not stay this way, but I can always hope and pray it will,  right ? dsgirl",

Then he explained it was to directly zap the tumor site only, the rest of the breast is done with radiation. I was marked with black marker, it was taped over and cautioned to shower with my back to the showerhead, do not get the tape or the marked area wet, huh ? how on earth do you manage to shower and not get wet all over ?  I have settled for washing the treated area with cottonballs, phisoderm soap and rinse gently with water soaked cotton balls, I do not apply anything to the approx 1 inch scuare that is all marked up and taped over. The rest of my breast gets a bath and I still apply the aloe vera -, skin feels like leather but does not look too bad. Knock on wood, no oozing or open sores visible. I too have some deep breast pain and stabbing pains that come and go, mild nausea, as far as I have read from other posts, it's normal after rads. I take an over the counter travel sickness med called Meclizine HCI 25 mg daily that my doc recommended both for nausea and for the travel I do to get to treatment daily. Seems to help me. I will be done on friday the 13th, Freakie ?  I hope not. Actually I consider the # 13 a lucky number, so I am ok with that. Now I can concentrate on getting the darn sciatica taken care of, then on to the dreaded next step, reclast and femara. Still sitting on the fence on those 2 issues, but will have to make up my mind before too long, see the surgeon and med. onc both in 2 weeks and they want to start asap. I have to deal with one thing at a time, I am such a whoooz when it comes to pain, and when a drug has side effects I always seem to be able to get them all. grrrrrrr.

I too have joint pain, wondering if the frozen position I seem to be in while I lay on the table awaiting my treatment is the cause ? believe me techs are fast and they are friendly and nice, but I seem to get in a funk when I get up there, have trouble breathing, my own fault, I hold my breath like something awful is going to happen to me, then I have to catch up on breathing, and dont want to overdo and really heave, oh, boy, then I am done, and am able to breathe normal again. I need my head examined I guess. Oh, well, fifteen down and 18 to go, Have a good weekend dsgirl",

I am already 3 weeks POST rads, and feel more energetic every day, but still have some down time. Don't always sleep well either, how is everyone else sleeping ?  I was wondering how many of us are going on to hormone therapy like Femara, Tamoxifen or Arimidex to name a few.  I for one was encouraged (told) to take Femara for 5 years by onc. doctor, I am going to wait until after the holidays to make my decision, I need a month of feeling good about being alive again, it's been a tough road on and off since my diagnosis in June 09, and I have started reading the posts about femara on this site to get a little input regarding sideeffects as I always seem to get them all no matter what kind of medication I am prescribed. The biggest worries for me is that I already have osteoporosis, and one of femara's sideeffects is bone loss, the other is arthritis, and some many report bone, joint aches, gee whiz, treatment of this disease is never an easy road  and it never, ever comes with any guarantees. Wishing everyone a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. dsgirl",

I have been feeling better and better as the rads are becoming a memory, last one Nov. 13th. Some of the spots I thought were new moles cropping up due to radiation, actually turned out to be tiny burns as they have now come off my skin with the continued use of aloe vera. I on and off have fluid build-up in my breast, above and below the incision, also have some cording at the wrist, gads trying to ignore it for the time being and just enjoy feeling human again, will address in the new year. The fluid comes and goes, so no real big problem yet, I massage the cord at the wrist when I can, and try to use my other hand as much as possible instead. We were gone from home and PC during Christmas, now back home. Not started the Femara as of yet, still reading, thinking, mulling it over. I have been wondering what kind of issues others have since rads was finished ? I hope we can still meet here and compare \"notes\" ever so often, you have all been so supportive and helpful. Sincerely dsgirl",

Like L-one, I have a long way to travel for treatment too, about 76 miles one way, found out this week during intial consultation and SIMS that is is doable, but will probably toward the end be a drag. I was asked what time was best for me, I thought 10:30am sounded good to me, would just have to leave home at 9 am, and being retired from working outside the home, I like to not get up at 6 am anymore. My luck was that this time was available after i have completed my first 3 treatments. Being 68 years young I still can't imagine going to work too during cancer treatment, I can't understand how so many of you can do that, but admire you for it. I had lumpectomy end of July, had a bad reaction to the blue tracer dye, so have been waiting for it to clear before rads. I had already bought aloe vera as I was told that the first visit, and today was handed a bottle of that by the techs, how nice of them. Well, I will check back in with you ladies on and off, and again best of luck to all of you. dsgirl",

I did some years ago drink one small glass of wine before bed, helped me sleep, and had read it was good for something (I think it was your heart) lol, I forget. Then I didn't have trouble sleeping anymore and stopped the wine drinking. I am thinking it's a good time to start again. I already have 10 treatments done, so I will start week 3 also. I was given a small bottle of aloe vera gel called \"Fruit of the earth\" at the center where I have my rad treatments, and it's the label  walmart carries, under $5.00 for a huge bottle. That is all I use too, of course that is because the doctor told me that was all he wanted me to use. Thanks for the info. dsgirl",

I think most of them do, and there is other help available, american cancer society, Lance Armstrong foundation, Susan Komen, to name a few. Many years ago I had gallbladder surgery and no insurance, and believe you me, it was hard, but even if you can only pay $20.00 or $100.00 per month or whatever, I am sure a plan can be worked out, you are worth it. I just got my first bill, luckily I do have insurance, and my Sims was around 5000. and each treatment around 800. then there are x-rays once a week a little over 100.  Yours seem to be alot higher, but I suppose it's different everywhere what is charged. Best wishes to you for a good outcome, both healthwise and financially. Liz- glad the symptoms are not due to the radiation, that is something we probably all worry about, the darn SE's. Linn and strongwoman, I too go to RT alone, but by choice, my husband always offers to take me, but I hate to just sit there in the car for 1 hr and 20 min while he is driving, makes me nervous, so I drive myself and play old music tapes and sing along, I seem to need a nap when I get home, and I take one, but then at night I seem to only be able to sleep for about 3 hrs, then I am wide away and it's 2:35AM, not sure if it's because of the nap. Weekend coming up and I will sleep in and catch up on sleep. Had # 14 today, samo samo. No problems yet anyway. dsgirl",

Of course everyone is probably treated different., I did luck out and had no major skin breakdown although my skin is fair, (redhead with freckles) I am healing well, get little stabbing pains on and off but have read from others that is normal, the techs said the radiated breast \"cooks\" for about 2 weeks after last treatment. To all of you who have the weeping sores or lots of pain, I am so sorry, use the meds they give you and you will be back to normal soon. Some day soon you also can yell Yeah I am done with rads. It really is so great to be done with rads, I wake up each morning going Yeah, I DONT have to go to rads., let's celebrate.  It was a long haul, and I am putting on the aloe vera still, then at nite I put on the udderly smooth, lol, made for cows originally I read, sometimes I use pure Vitanim E oil, I was told I could use whatever made the skin feel good now that I am done with rads. I still wash gingerly, mostly just squeeze mild soapy water over the breast and let it run over it, then a fine soft spray from the shower head, and only pat dry, finish drying with a fan. dsgirl",

I have more like a painful swelling, around the nipple, it's the area I had the blue tracer dye injected months ago before lumpectomy.  Back then it swelled like that, after treatment with antibiotics and prednizone, it was 70% better, but never did go away completely. The dye contains sulfur and I am allergic to that. I will post after I talk to onc. tomorrow. Hope you find some relief from the soreness, we still have a way to go. dsgirl",
