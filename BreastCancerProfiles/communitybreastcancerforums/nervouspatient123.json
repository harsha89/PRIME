I told my mum about this but she believes that it could just be stretch marks but over the past few weeks it has faded but gotten bigger in circumference. Over the last few days i have been getting these strange dull pains in my left breast were the red patch is, but at times i can getting a sharpe stabbing pain that is really serve.i have an area of thickened tissue in the outer upper quarter of the breast where the pain is localised to. I have told my parents about this but they believe it could just be due to growing. another important factor to consider is that i am 14 and i am going through puberty and still maturing. But i cant seem to shake the thought that i may have breast cancer, i am absolutely terrified, stressed out and have been going through overwhelming feelings of anxiety. I am really not sure what to do? could all this just we due to growing? Please Help Log in to post a reply",
