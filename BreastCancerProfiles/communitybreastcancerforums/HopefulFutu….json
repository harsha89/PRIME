It was a very tough decision, and my age and family history had a lot to do with it. At 37, with a mother and maternal grandmother who had breast cancer, my risk was high to begin with. My grandmother died of breast cancer because she caught it too late. Also, my DCIS was difficult to find. Luckily, I found a lump, but ultrasounds, mammograms, MRI's and needle biopsies were inconclusive. It took an excisional biopsy to find 2cm of DCIS lurking underneath. This is a very personal choice, but I have a 4 year old child and decided that I wanted to maximize my chances of having a long life. I also didn't want rads or Tamoxifen for health reasons. And for me, a BMX was a better choice if I wanted to expand my family soon. My ER/PR+ DCIS may have had a higher chance of recurrence during pregnancy, and if I had opted with rads or Tamoxifen, I would have had to wait a couple years before getting pregnant again. Again, a very personal choice, but for me, it was the right one and I have no regrets. Good luck with your surveillance!",
