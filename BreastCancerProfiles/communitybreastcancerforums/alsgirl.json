I was terrified also but am amazed at how well it all went. The infusion itself only takes about 2 1/2 hours. They gave me so many anti nausea medications before hand and others to take home that I have had no nausea whatsoever. I didn't even take them all. the biggest side effect has been fatigue. By 9 p.m. at night, I am wiped out which is unusual for me because I'm a night owl. I'm actually amazed at how good I feel.",
