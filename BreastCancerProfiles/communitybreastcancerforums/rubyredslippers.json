    "Content": "rubyredslippers wrote: I've just returned to work after 5 weeks of radiation thanks to a recurrence in a lymph node. I'm sliding into a massive depression, dealing with the anger, saddness, frustration confusion etc we all feel. Any tips on how to deal with people who flippantly say \"how's things\", or \"whats wrong\" when you respond with low enthusiasm, as though nothings happened ? I realise people are self involved. I also realise most say these things out of habit but how do you respond to this and how do yoy cope with it emotionally? I feel like it adds to my anger being asked how I am like nothing has happened or like Im expected to be brimming with happiness. Please help as this is really bothering me. I'd be grateful for some helpful advice Surgery 7/4/2008 Lumpectomy; Lymph node removal: Sentinel Chemotherapy 8/31/2008 AC Radiation Therapy 12/14/2008 Breast Dx 6/20/2017, IDC, Right, <1cm, Stage IIIA, Grade 3, 1/18 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Surgery 7/27/2017 Lymph node removal: Right Surgery 9/4/2017 Lymph node removal: Underarm/Axillary Log in to post a reply",
