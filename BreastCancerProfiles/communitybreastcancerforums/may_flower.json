This just started a few weeks ago and even happens when the nipple is erect. I have a fibroadenoma that is 1.3cm but stable and also have a simple cyst in that breast that measures 2.7cm that has been there and has grown over the last year. Can these fibrocystic conditions cause this? Log in to post a reply",

I wasn't sure if benign conditions could cause this, so thanks for the link it's helped put my mind at ease.Â  GrammyR, thanks for your reply. I had a biopsy to confirm the fibroadenoma about 15 months ago and was told it was stable with my mammo/ultrasound at the first of February this year. It does sit somewhat behind the left nipple and areola that's why the sudden nipple retraction caught my attention. I hate hearing they let you go for 3 years without a biopsy. Hope you are in good hands now! I called my gyn this morning and asked for her recommendation to a breast surgeon. Got lucky and have an appointment on May 6th.",
