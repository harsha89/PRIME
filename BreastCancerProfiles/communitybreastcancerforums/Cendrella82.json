Afther the surgery, we obtained the report which included the following: tumor dimension: 7cm tumor location: upper outer quadrant mitotic activity :intermediate lymphovascular invasion: present in situ component: absent infiltrating carcinoma infiltrating: absent the diagnosis says: that infiltrating carcinoma with lobular features grade 2/3 (scarff bloom richardson) surgical margins: free of tumor metastatic carcinoma in eleven of eleven lymph nodes I do not know what would be her treatment, her surgeon told her to see the oncologist (our cousin), but before seeing him, I would like to have an idea: would she be needing chemotherapy? radio? or drugs (hormones) would be enough? My mum is my heart, I hope this operation that she did will make live more and more, I love her so much. Thank you for your help. Log in to post a reply",
