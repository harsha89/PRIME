They were actually the best around day 12, then got worse. I just wish they would heal! I am a teacher and have to go back to work next week. If I lie perfectly still they don't bother me. I think it is partly due to a heat rash kind of thing--they are still large enough after lumpetomcy/reduction to create a sweaty crease at the incision when I stand, and every bra band hits right on top of these horizontal incisions running under both breasts. The cancerous breast is hard and warm to touch, noncancerous reduced side has a red rash but otherwise no complications. They put back on antibiotics last week but I have not seen any improvements, I even started running a fever again. I should add that it is not normal for me to get skin irritations easily. And I am supposed to start radiation therapy in a few weeks too!   Anyone else with surgery 3+ weeks ago still experiencing healing problems? ",

This week most numbness has been replaced by shooting pains that I was afraid were lung problems. I spent a good part of yesterday searching these boards for simliar symptoms and have concluded it is as my doctor said, normal recovery symptoms as nerves regenerate and tissue heals. I had a lumpectomy with a fist-size amount of tissue removed. Two other things I learned this week from doc and confirmed on these boards by others' docs: 1) Taking at least tylenol is important as it is also an antiinflammatory as we heal. I am not a pill taker so this has been an adjustment for me. I still find I need 1 percoset in the late afternoon, but I am down to that plus 500 mg of tylenol every 4 hours when I remember. 2) I have been told to NOT allow my heart rate to increase or blood pressure to rise for at least another week as it can cause internal bleeding. Doc said walking on a level surface is ok, but no hills, no exercise bike etc.  ",

The doc made it sound like the week off was normal, and that my reactions are normal so far. I just know that with three days off this weekend, the treated areas seemed to get worse and worse as the weekend progressed. My only reference point is very bad sunburns, which I did experience as a teenager, but don't remember continuing to cook this much afterwards.  I had some blisters near my cleavage area that I managed to heal over the weekend though, with plenty of aloe and lotion they gave me. We think I scratched itchy area at night and broke open little heat rash blisters that are actually pores as some have said.  The surprise for me was the tenderness under my armpit. It was tan there but no pain, I assume because it is not in the bra area. Like others, I am not comfortable braless due to healing/scarring issues from lumpectomy. The other thing in my favor is that feeling has not returned to my nipple area since surgery, I think if it had it would be super sore, as it is very burnt and tender looking. All I know is I am almost done. I really don't want to do any hormone therapy; I plan to be very strong in this position unless they can throw definitive statistics and studies at me that can prove I need it. ",

I just want a normal few months and to finish out the school year before dealing with potential side effects so I will revisit the issue in June.  Take care all and thanks to Aussie Kate for starting this board 3 months ago.

I am really having no physical side effects yet, put pure Aloe gel on 1x per day (I get treated in the afternoon so put it on after getting home at night with loose t). Not even having a problem wearing bras, I am still a C cup even after lumptectomy and reduction to even things up. I have notice the irradiated breast is now darker complected and seems warmer to touch, and it looks like a tiny bit of discharge from my nipple, but no pain associated with any of this.  What I have noticed is that I am totally grumpy--about the interruption in my day 5x/week to drive to treatment; the traffic, the inconvenience, the parking, the red lights, make me want to scream! Once I am in the room and on the table I now take a catnap until they tell me I am done. Like many of you, I am also a teacher (5th grade) in a private school and we have open house to attract enrollment starting this weekend, plus report cards went out today so I have been under alot of stress on the job. I have welcomed the distraction from focusing on my cancer issues, but it is way too much and I lose my temper and patience frequently--when someone forces a schedule change on me, when anything unexpected happens I freak.  I have also noticed a little fatigue the past few days. My worst stress on the job will pass by next week (gratefully) so I am curious to see if my grumpiness goes away (hoping so) before SEs set in, if they do.   Finally, for those of you who say this is rough and no fair that folks don't understand and say we should feel grateful because it could be worse, it is rough and it could be worse. That is the way it is.  I have two brother-in-laws, both close to my age (54) who will most likely die of their more serious cancers in the short term while I know, despite all the ickiness, I will survive this. For that I am grateful, and also grateful for the perspective their illnesses have provided me since I was diagnosed.",

At my facility they work as a team and all met with me in succession after initial diagnosis. I too only needed surgery and radiation and not chemo, it looks like your tumor is similar in size and stage. The kind of cancer I have (mucinous) does not respond to chemo. I feel very lucky for not having to go through that which so many others of you have endured. I had drawn out healing issues after surgey which is why my radiation treatment is starting so much later. ",

Sounds like you are really lving healthy, may be an inspiration for me to get more focused on that. I was really good pre and post surgery but slipped into stress and fatigue induced snacking and blowing off exercise opportunities since. ",
