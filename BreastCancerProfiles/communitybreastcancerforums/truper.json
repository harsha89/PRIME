I'm so confused on what to do. I've seen the MO a General Surgeon & Reconstruction Dr two times but I think I was still in denial at the time and did not know all these question to ask....now I'm not sure what to do. My surgery is Dec 13th. I was diagnosed in Oct and have went thru so many test and still having testing done, my thyriod scan is today a Dexa Scan on Dec 6th. Can I upload my Pet and MRI scan on here? ( there is so much to type). Please help...I can't sleep! Thanks for all your help!
