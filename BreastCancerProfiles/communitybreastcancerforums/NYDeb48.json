ChrisC433 -  I am also in the neoadjuvant group.  My tumor according to ultr/mammo was 2.5 , then MRI said 5cm.  So, we are shrinking it and hopefully the lumpectomy route.  I have had 2 TX now and can literally feel it becoming smaller.  My onco thinks we can just obliterate it. Crusader- What a cruel joke, TCX4 , then go to TCX6.  We are really at the mercy of these DRs and their opinions.  I started out being told TCX4 also.  Then , when they found out I was triple neg, he switched it to TCX6.  At least I can see some rationalization in mine, though I would rather be half done now. Alyad-  I can so hear you on the work thing.  My SEs have been pretty mild and I have to say I have gone to work feeling worse than this.  Unfortunately, my job is just not conducive.  I spoke with my manager yesterday to see if they could find me an alternative assignment temporarily somewhere on station.  I've worked all my life , and except for childbirth, have stayed home sick about 5 days in 30 years.  This is driving me crazy.",

Just had to chime in on the nurse thing.  I work with many nurses everyday.  Guess what, they put their scrubs on one leg at a time like everyone else.  Some are more personable than others.  But overall, they do a great job.  Consider they are in the middle dealing with doctors and patients.  As far as any nurses with this whole BC thing, I have dealt with nothing but warm and compassionate ones. Does anyone have any big plans for Easter weekend? ",

Janine   Glad to see you are doing well and getting on with life.  My hair is about 2 inches long now and did not fall out after just one dose of Adriamycin.  It is thinning a bit, but not enough to make me buzz it. Went to see the PS on monday and he decided that the healing process was going to take too long and we needed to get me back to the chemo train.  I suspect that my onco and he talked. Anyways, he had me in surgery at noon yesterday, cleaned everything out ( debridement) and closed it all up.  I should be back at chemo in a couple weeks.  I feel best today since before my original surgery on Sept 29th and my DH is a happy camper that his duties of wound packing are over. No doubt that everyone has been listening intently about the whole cancer screening proposals.  Is that not the most outrageous thing you ever heard?  How many of us found our cancer through self examination or mammogram?  I was always a terible procrastinator when it came to my own health care and now they are just fueling that fire for so many women.  Ok, off my soapbox.

Diane  Really, who has time in life to go through this all over EVER.  I finally spoke to my previous BS on Monday.  He actually told me that I had 2 options, mast or just let the lumpectomy go and treat it down the road if there is a recurrence.  I was speechless, are you kidding?  I thought  (past tense) the world of him and respected him and his work.  He made me feel like I was just a slab of meat after that conversation.  I got off the phone and sobbed for an hour.

Dawn and Luvtosing :  remember way back when we had a discussion about your Drs being warm and fuzzy .  I thought those kind didn't exist and you guys were crazy. I am so happy to say that I was wrong.   Yesterday at my appointment, my new onc walks in and first thing she rearranges everyone in the examining room so I can sit next to her.  She is very touchy feely, something I have so not encountered.  When I left she hugged me and said she felt like she had know me forever.  So, next week we start the adriamycin , farewell fair hair.  Oh well, 8 short weeks and it will be over.",

Hi, I received this from another Breast Cancer Survivor and wanted to pass it on to my friends. Please read and watch the YouTube. It is great. Fondly, Linda Our daughter-in-law, Emily (MacInnes) Somers, created, directed and choreographed this in Portland last week for her Medline glove division as a fundraiser for breast cancer awareness. This was all her idea to help promote their new pink gloves. I don't know how she got so many employees, doctors and patients to participate, but it started to really catch on and they all had a lot of fun doing it. When the video gets 1 million hits, Medline will be making a huge contribution to the hospital, as well as offering free mammograms for the community . Please check it out.

That being said, I need to unload.  I had a phone call from my \" wonderful\" new onc yesterday, less than 24 hours after meeting with her.  She said that their pathology department( at her hospital)  reviewed my slides from my re-incision surgery and contrary to the other hospitals path report they found more cancer cells.  I swear if I didn't have bad luck , I wouldn't have any at all.  So, after 8 months I am back to where I started.  4 months of chemo did nothing.  2 surgeries did nothing.   How can one path dept. say absolutely no cancer found in a specimen and the other say extensive.  You have to wonder if that is how recurrences happen.  I know again that I am very fortunate to have switched oncs or they would never have known and again perhaps this will save me. I have always been the \"cup half full\" portion of our marriage.  So, today I am totally freaking my poor hubby out.  He keeps telling me to keep my spirits up, even told me once today to buck up.  I just want to say I love you sooooo very much, but just let me be down for a while.  He's trying so hard.  We spent the afternoon indulging to make me feel better.  We spent 2 hours out on the boat and swam in the middle of the lake( yeah I know , \"stay out of the sun\").  When we came home we had \"sex on the beach\"  - the alcoholic beverage not the act of. Then my DH made ribs for dinner. Monday will be here soon enough and I will start over with the Dr merry-go-round and see what the next step is.  Can I get a refund on my ticket to this amusement park?  Sorry for the whine, just had to let it out .",

It's been such a long time since I joined in on this board.   Certainly, I check in occasionally and had just been thrilled with how well everyone was doing.  I speak of this board often , whenever I meet someone recently diagnosed with any type of cancer.  They usually want to know how to cope and how I dealt with it.  I tell them that beyond my immediate family, nothing was more beneficial than this board.  Though you don't hear from me often, I want all of you to know how much you mean to me.",

With the drugs ( decadron overload) perhaps I will actually see midnight.  Yep, that's right, the last march warrior has officially closed down the chemo caboose.....Yeeee   freakin   haaaaaa!! Thanks so much to everyone for all the support, couldn't have done it without you. Crazy thing , my hair has not fallen out and I'm on day 29 .  It has thinned some, but not enough to buzz it off.  It's probably just teasing me and will fall out a month from now.  The oncos office is just amazed.  One of the nurses apologized for staring at me saying she had to look close and be sure it wasn't a wig.  I told her way too much gray for that and please don't be afraid to just ask anything.  The days of modesty , being surprised or self conscious about our bodies or any health questions are long gone. Cheers to all (  I raise my glass of cranberry juice....no vodka today) as we say a not so fond farewell to 2009 and look forward to a fabulous 2010.",

Buddy :  Nice to hear from you, been awhile  Good luck with the LE problems.   Dayla:  I watched a special on the AT the other day on Nat Geo Channel and thought of you.  It sucks that you are having the LE issues, but good that you are catching it early and before you hit the road.  Like you, I'm an outdoor person and everything I do is physical. Beth :  It is a lot to consider, reconstruction and all.  I would say that most people don't have complications and would not make that the deciding factor.  I can't wait to see my PS on the 18th and hopefully one last surgery to even out the \"girls\".... right now I have Big Bertha on the left and Baby Betty on the right.  He said he can move over the flap on the right and make that one larger and lipo out some from the left to even us out. I opted out of radiation after a great consult with the Rad Onco.  She basically left it that in cases like mine half of the women chose radiation and half chose not. I saw a OT yesterday for a consult on what to do to prevent LE as well as get some exercises to increase my range of motion from surgery.  She said I was doing reallyt well and took all the baseline measurements just in case there is an issue down the road.  She stressed to be sure to get seen if there are any signs and not wait until they are out of control.   I think I am finally going to get off the revolving Dr carousel... just the PS to deal with for 3 months. Oh yeah, my hair finally gave up yesterday...crap.  It certainly lasted longer than I anticipated.  I figured making it by frosting cookies was a bonus and more than I could ask for!!",
