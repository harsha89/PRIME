I dont think i have ever really dealt with the cancer. was diagnosed late july 2011 with thyroid and breast. had thyroid removed august and breast removed sept. expansion,, then rad,  I completed rads this week. Am seriously burned and have tried a lot of remedies, Cant take pain meds and have basically done all of this with no pain meds.

Find that the expander is like a rock and the skin very tight. Looks like I have red dots all over my foob and extreme redness and irritation under my arm. Found out the hard way not to use soap. Have AD ointment, pure aloe, and 1% hydrocortozone cream, I am allergic to the sulfa drug... any help or thoughts... I just need to talk... And ... scared of the tamoxifen",

Had been doing fine but with all the pain but maintaining. Had a massive anxiety problem duriing the week of 0ct 10 and basically lost my mind to the point i thought they were going to commit me. The problem was I had my thyroid removed one month prior due to cancer and was being given synthroid at a too high dose. Am very sensitive to drugs so I was hospitalized to detox me me from all meds. I am currently on a low dose of zoloft and low dose antianxiety med. I am feeing much better and going day to day. I realized that i never accepted the fact that i had cancer and was just going with the flow on tests, dr appointments, forms , etc... Never knew what not talking about it would do to me emotionally, I now see a therapist to help me through.. I have returned to work, am a high school science teacher, and am doing daily activities. I am finding it difficult to do simle things such as lifting a milk jug, pulling laundry out of the washer, etc.... I am doing probably more than I should but the anxiety creeps in if i just sit around, I have been getting my TE filled once a week and am on my 4th.. he is doing 30 cc at a time. I have pulling and swelling above where my breast used to be and a \"sack\"; that forms under my breast weekly which he drains about 40 cc from with a syringe. I have n0 tenderness in my arm but the stinging from the nerves. Chemo is not recommended because the tumor and Cancer did not show in my sentinel nodes. I do need radiation which i have not even read about yet,,, I feel as though I am rambling here. I had invasive ductal carcinoma which was caught early. I need someone to talk to me here about the swelling, trying to do all this without pain/.muscle relax meds(cannot take them) and just basic help. I just need to have someone who has gone down this path to help me...
