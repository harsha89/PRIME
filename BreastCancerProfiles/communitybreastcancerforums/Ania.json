They were going to remove the lump today but the doctor said she needs chemo before the surgery bc the lump is growing too fast. I think it's a good idea, I will tell my aunt to get second opinion",

She was supposed to have surgery today to remove the lump on her breast however the doctor said that it grew too much and he won't be able to operate at this time. He also said that if it's a certain type of breast cancer (they're doing blood work and cat scan inÂ  a week) he won't be able to do anything for her, meaning no surgery or treatment. I don't know anything about breast cancer, Can you please help me understand what type of cancer my aunt might have and is there hope? Log in to post a reply",
