So here's my sitch: I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008 at 22 years old. I had a bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction and also had a negative sentinel node biopsy. Following my surgery I was instructed to try and refrain from blood draws on the affected arm. Fast forward to 10 years to being cancer free. I have never experienced any swelling or Lymphedema in the affected arm or anywhere else and am considering a tattoo on the affected arm. I've made my appointment and because it had been so long since I was given these instructions, I hadn't even thought about the location I decided on and it being an issue until it just dawned on me this morning. My questions to the forum are the following: 1: Has anyone been tattooed on the affected arm following the biopsy? If so, how long after? 2: After 10 years with no swelling, in your opinion would this still be too big of a risk to take? I know this may seem crazy to most to even consider the risk but I have to believe I'm not the only breast cancer survivor in the world that has considered this. My oncologist retired last year and I haven't set up anything with a new one and my general surgeon is no longer in the area. My plastic surgeon is still around and did tattoo my areolas following reconstruction so he may a good outlet as well. Log in to post a reply",
