I have an new consultation scheduled with a new ps who has worked a lot with my gs.  I'm asking my gs and my ps to make my incision below my breast rather in the mid area of my breast, even though they will also have to remove my nipple according to the advice I'm getting from my gs. I'm interested in hearing your experience.  Please share. Thanks, Rhonda",
