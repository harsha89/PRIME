I found a lump in my breast in May of 2003. It was 3cm. I just turned 50. Went to the Dr, did a biopsy and it was postive for breast cancer. While sitting at the dr's office, all I heard was you have breast cancer, blah, blah, blah. thank God my husband was with me because I never heard another word. Once the shock wore off, i started reading and learning all I could about breast cancer, treatments and options. this helped me feel like I had some control over this terrible disease. After meeting with 2 different surgeons, I decided to have a masectomy without reconstruction. I could not make up my mind at that time what I wanted to do and knew that I could have it done at anytime down the road if I chose to. It seemed like there were too many decisions to make at such a critical time so I opted to take one thing at a time-dealing with my cancer and treatment. I was also going to be a first time grandmother and wanted to recover as quicky as I could. My lymph nodes were clean. I had 8 rounds of chemo and am currently still on Farastan which is like tamoxifin except it supposedly has less risk for uterine cancer.Â  I never did get a boob, sometimes still think about it, but am okay without it. I was actually more traumatized losing my hair at first. That too passed and I wore nothing on my head or just scarves for most of the time. Cancer has helped me to figure out the things in my life that are important and the ability to just be who I am. I've learned what real fear is. The only bad thing is I've become more mouthy and less tolerant of bull---- and not afraid to say so. This May, I will be 5 years cancer free. Oh, I did develope lymphedema of the arm. But that is under control. I went to therapy at the beginning and it seems to be okay. I developed it 5 months after my surgery. For those of you who are getting surgery with lymph node removal, ask about lymphedema. Noone ever really explained it to me. For me now, everyday is a gift from God. I am thankful to be here and because of and in spite of this disease, have met some truly remarkable people along this journey. Thanks for listening.",
