Thank you ladies, for all of your positive energy and kind words.  The waiting was tormenting.  But the phone call was good.  The doctor said it's a benign hamartoma ( a cluster of breast tissue ).  He said it is golf-ball size but since it's just breast tissue that I don't even need to have it removed.  I'm thinking of a consulting a breast surgeon to be sure--b/c if it may cause me problems down the line, I'm thinking I should have it removed now.  Any suggestions? Again, thanks to all of you for your support!  I am going to continue to come back to this website and check in on you guys and those who are going through the waiting process. I will continue to pray for those who did not get the good news.  Even though my results were benign, I still feel a connection to you guys.  I was picturing myself going through it all already.  You are and will continue to be an inspiration to me!  You are such strong women whom I admire so much!  God Bless!--Celi",

My kids watched their 18-yr-old cousin die of cancer on Valentine's Day.  He was diagnosed one year ago.  My dad was diagnosed last month with esophageal cancer.  My husband is a cancer survivor of 4 years.  My grandmother and aunt both died from breast cancer.  This disease frightens me--and angers me.  Although I've seen it affect so many people I love--I'm scared I may have it and I can't even fathom that thought-not so much for myself, but for my husband and kids.  Help....
