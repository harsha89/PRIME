I recently had my first follow-up mammogram since my unilateral mastectomy. It was clear but imagine my surprise when I read the first line \"standard views of both breasts were taken\". It did nothing to make me comfortable with the reliability of the study or the radiologist. My breast surgeon requested an ultrasound (read by a different radiologist) be done to ease my concerns and that also came out fine but I will never again feel comfortable with the radiologist reports.",

My breast surgeon didn't really give me a choice (I know I had a choice but at the time it didn't feel that way) but I can't imagine that I would have said no. The difference between having positive or negative nodes changes your treatment. I had a total of 8 nodes removed - all were NEGATIVE and I have had no pain or side effects related to the SNB. I do treat that arm differently in terms of preventing lymphadema - no injections and blood pressure readings on that side. I would do the same even if I didn't have the SNB. Knowing that there was no node involvement meant that no further treatment (chemo or radiation) was needed and allowed me to proceed with the reconstruction I wanted.",

      "Content": "Oct 2, 2007 08:55AM - edited Oct 2, 2007 08:56AM by cbl I had my unilateral tram 14 months ago and I am really very pleased.  I was in the hospital for just 2 nights.  I went home with 3 drains and the On-Q pain ball but everything was removed 4 days later.  I was on oral pain medication for about a week.  The pain meds definitely make you constipated so if you can take something to prevent or ease it you should.  You might also want something to make sure you sleep.  You will heal much better if you sleep well.  I  took ambien for about 2 weeks after my surgery and it was like a miracle. I slept in my own bed but with a lot of pillows.  I don't drive much so that was not an issue for me but I could have driven after about 10 days if I wanted and needed to.  Standing up straight was the most difficult.  I did the  excercises i was given after the mastectomy and regained my range of motion and mobility very quickly but standing and walking were much harder than I anticpated.  Every day things got a little easier and after 6 weeks I was back to \"normal\" but there were times when I didn't think I would ever be straight.  I have not lost any abdominal strength - in fact I am more motivated to excercise because of my flat belly so I probably have better abs than before.  All in all, it is a long surgery and a long recovery but I am very glad it was what I chose. Good luck.",
