I recently bought the Solidea Armcare garment for my Mum but ended up having to buy it from the states and the postage made it cost about half as much again! We are in New Zealand and I haven't been able to locate any local importers. We will probably buy some more as it is such a functional and comfortable garment. Thank you all so much for your help and support :)",
