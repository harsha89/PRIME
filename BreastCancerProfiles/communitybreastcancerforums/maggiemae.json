Thanks for starting this thread!  The connection to other nurses is great! Andrea",

When I was diagnosed, I didn't know much about breast cancer (thank goodness kids don't get breast cancer!).  The doctor that gave me my diagnosis was wonderful.  She sat down with me for about an hour and explained the differences in the types of breast cancer, I was very fortunate to have her.  Later in my journey I found the opposite where I guess some people assumed I could understand what they had to say and were afraid of maybe talking down to me.  It took me forever to get all of the information I needed from my genetics concelor and to understand it all!  I think as nurses we can help our healthcare providers by encouraging them to talk to all patients in a manor that is easily understood.
