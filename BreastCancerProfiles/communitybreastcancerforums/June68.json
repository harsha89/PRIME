I'm happy I chose to do the reconstruction at the same time, I actually woke up with \"breasts\" the same size as what I had and am only set to do 2 fills. I think the first 4 daysÂ were the worst where I used a lot of pain pills, but after that each day got better and today I actually drove my car. Best of luck to you!",
