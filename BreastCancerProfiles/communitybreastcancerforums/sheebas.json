Yesterday i had my hairdresser cut my hair half an inch long all over.  I thought it would fall out from there and I'd be OK with that but my  scalp hurts when my hair gets bent and it was bent all day in the wig.  My hairdresser said she would come to my house anytime and shave the hair off for me. She wouldn't take any payment for making it short yesterday then today she wouldn't take any payment for cutting the wig because she'd never done one before and said she wanted to do something for me. It feels good to know she cares. now i hate to ask her to come to the house for free.  I think i could get it all off with a lint roller but it would take a long time (just kidding) anybody try using the vauum cleaner to get it off?

If you can have someone with you who understands and loves you.   Ask the Dr. about getting some  ativan when you go for the pre-treatment appointment.Tell them how you feel. It goes better for them too if you are relaxed.   It might be standard practice to offer it during treatment where I live but I'd check ahead of time just to be sure.  good luck Judy ",

I just didn't bounce back.  I kept thinking day 8 is the day I'll be better. That didn't happen.  I started feeling some better by about day 14 or so. I think it was the steroids.  I gained about 8 pounds on day 3 and lost it again overnight on day 7 or 8.  It was horrible. My skin felt like I was wearing a jacket about 1/4 of an inch thick and it felt like there was a space between me and my skin. That lasted about 2 days. I had diareah for about 10 days.  Thank God for Imodium.  The worse thing is this terrible cough. When I was first diagnosed with mets in Dec 05. I had a terrible cough.  I had an oopherectomy and went on hormonal treatments.  The cough cleared up.  I have a pleural effusion and mets in the pleural cavity as well as some bones.  When the hormonals quit working, the oncs said time for chemo.  I was starting to cough a bit so that was one reason for the chemo.  Now the cough is almost as bad as ever.  Coughing all evening, for a couple hours after lying down and off and on during the day.  This makes me think the chemo is not working.  I have finished 3 rounds of A/C, 3 to go.   I go to Vancouver ( 500 miles away) and see my onc Monday for an appointment that was scheduled 4 months ago to assess the chemo.  My best hope now is to hear that several of you have also been coughing.  Maybe a cough that would be small to most of you would really bother my weakened, asthmatic lungs.  I hope it's just a part of chemo.  I have to admit this is a trying time for me. I will be travelling Tuesday and not getting my  bloodwork done so my chemo schedule will be off a couple days even if it does continue. Thanks for listening Judy",

Things are not going well for me.  The chemo wasn't working.  I didn't have A/C last week as I was scheduled to. I will be starting Xeloda by mouth in a day or two. I don't think there is anyone left on here doing Xeloda by mouth is there? My cough is worse, an indication that the chemo wasn't working.  I'll be having a CT scan of my lungs tomorrow. To see why I'm coughing so much.  Cancer was in the pleural cavity before.  I have some red bumps on my scalp about the size of pimples. One of those was biopsied last week. They are cancer and the biopsy showed that some cancer cells in it had responded to the A/C and some had not.  There is a more aggressive cancer there that was not responding so there is no sense continuing that chemo.  Two years ago I had my ovaries out and began hormone treatments. The coughing stopped and the red spots cleared up.  Those drugs failed and I'm now trying chemo.  So far it doesn't look too good.  There is only one more chemo drug after the Xeloda and that's it. Jenn51, You asked about the Canadian health system and me having to drive so far to the onc.  In my opinion the Canadian health system is great.  Everyone has access to the same treatment. Hospitals are currently understaffed and wait times for elective surgeries like knee transplants can be over a year.  Everyone has the same basic insurance paid for by their employer or, if unemployed or a low income, paid for by the government. The only thing individuals pay for is prescriptions and after a certain deductible even those are paid for if your income is low.  The only thing I have had to pay for with this cancer is the premeds. Unfortunately, the population is more dense in the south part of the country and most all of the cancer centres and most specialist live in the denser areas. That is why I have to travel so far from my town of 10,000. I know that sometimes the chemo has seemed like such a drag.  I just want to reassure everyone that you are doing the right thing.  I felt so lucky in 1996 when they said my tumour was too small and no lymph involvement so lumpectomy and radiation would be enough.  They were wrong.  Do everything you can to prevent recurrence.  These few months will seem like such a small part of your life in a few years, and well worth it I think, if only for piece of mind.  Good luck everyone.

I came back ready to start.  saw the Dr. and chemo nurse who said \"you need a port\" that was Jan 15 since then the only surgeon went away for a week. finally saw him yesterday.  can't do it without a consult from the only anetheisiologist who doesn't work today and is in surgery tommorrow so looks like Thurs. is the earliest for the port.  Dr. won't use the port when brand new and doesn't work Monday  so maybe next Tuesday we'll finally get started.  3 weeks later than my onc suggested. I called local chemo office and suggested we just start without the port tomorrow. they said no a couple more days won't matter. What do they know? they aren't oncs. I think this is making me crazy.  I'm almost ready to get my hair dyed again it looks like i'll have it for another 3 weeks. I'm startin to ahve some syptoms like coughing and small lumps forming on myscalp like I did a couple of years ago before i started the hormonals.  It seems like the medical people just don't care.  whatever works for the is supposed to work for the patient.  i wonder if I should drive 500 miles each way through the snowy roads but by the time i get there I'll only save about 2 days.  I'm blowing off some frustration here with people i think will understand thanks for listening Judy",

I don't want to mess with that.  After reading your post I felt more \"normal\". No, not normal, a sapphire. Thanks for that image. The Jewels is such a good name. Part of the problem is that I have mets. I want something good from every day and some of these latest days just don't have much to offer. About my hair, or rather my head. I haven't put my picture in because it really does look awful.  All the pictures that you girls have put in have been beautiful.  It must be the beautiful smiles you are all giving each other that make you look so good.  After almost 4 weeks my hair has still not finished falling out.  I had it cut off to about an inch long all over and shaved to above my ears at the back. The top and front will not finish falling out.  My dh said he would shave it but there is a little fringe around my face enough that if I had a scarf on some hair around my temples and a few bangs would stick out.  I think I want to keep it for that reason but it does look awful on my head.  What's there sticks up all over and is very thin. There are 6 or 8 red spots on my head since I started treatment that sometimes itch or irritate. Anyone know what to do about them? By the way, I can't concentrate on reading either. I hope this thread and website does as much for others as it did for me today. Good nite. Peaceful sleeps everyone. Judy",
