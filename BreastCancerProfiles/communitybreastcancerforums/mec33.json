I thought that it was part of the hickey and just ignored it. later on, the hickey finally disappeared, leaving the bruise still there. I was looking in the mirror and found another small bruise, where no one has touched or tampered with. I am only 17 years old and am really concerned. but afraid to bring it up to anyone nothing. and I don't want to worry anyone. any help would be appreciated. Log in to post a reply",
