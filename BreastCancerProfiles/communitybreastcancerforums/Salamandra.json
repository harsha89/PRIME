It felt very warm to hot throughout the whole time. Towards the end it started feeling heavier and a bit harder too. The nipple turned a bit darker and got more sensitive. My breast got a bit uncomfortable though never painful. I found the \"radiadres\" gel pads they gave me really nice, seemed to cool things off, draw out the heat or something (though it was terrible at sticking). For me the feeling was less like a headache and sort of more like a cut that's starting to scar and heal, how that can get all hot and sensitive. Anything I wore left lines/markes on me and it was much nicer without a bra. But it never got worse than that, my skin never broke or anything. I freaked out a bit because the redness and fatigue came on so fast and hard, but it stayed pretty constant. ",

My guess is that if I had pushed, they would have done what I wanted. But I ended up getting a note from the psychiatrist at the center at that was fine. A lot of women do work through rads, but I don't think it's a little deal at all. To be honest, if it were men getting this treatment on their secondary sex characteristics, I doubt people would be so nonchalant about sending us to work! That said, for some women, they barely have any side effects, and/or have pretty comfortable jobs, and/or find a lot of psychological value in going to work every day, and/or financially really need to work. So much respect and more power to them! I have a pretty physically and emotionally demanding job where going braless would be unadvisable (teaching high school). On a pure time basis I could have handled the logistics but I think it would have destroyed my emotional health and probably future capacity to do the job, at least for a while. I also started getting the fatigue and skin sensitivity side effects after the second day of treatment. Don't let anyone push you into what's 'no big deal' or not! Lots of people want to minimize everything to do with this stuff because it makes them feel psychologically more comfortable. For me, taking time off work made a world a difference to my quality of life and mental/emotional health. If YOU feel like you would benefit from time off, trust yourself. I argued with myself for weeks. Was I just being a slacker? etc etc. Screw that. If I can't be a slacker about goddamn breast cancer what can I be a slacker about? What break has my years of responsible adult-ing and hard work and conscientious care taking of myself and others earned me, if not to take this time off? So I'd say, listen to your gut. Be ready to pressure your doctors (if I'd have had to fight, I would have recruited my brother or another male friend to pressure the male radiation oncologist, or made another appointment and brought the paperwork to his female resident, whom I liked so much), and make sure you check and make sure that your health insurance coverage will not be impacted by your leave.",

I really wanted to work through because I haven't been in the system that long and don't have that much paid leave, and really liked the idea of preserving it. But it was really messing with my mind to try to work. The two or so weeks I went back after surgery before taking off again were an ordeal. Now I'm really nervous about going back. And I have to remind myself that I really liked my job before all of this started! Trying to force myself to work through was a mistake. Mental/emotional health is health too, and I think that this diagnosis does have a large mental/emotional component that I feel gets really neglected by most doctors. I'm really lucky that I was able to (after multiple tries and advocacy) see a psychiatrist through the cancer center who was willing to write me a note for work when both the surgeon's office and the radiator's office were being very cagey about the whole thing. Like it would mess up their stats or something. That said, I know that plenty of women have worked through radiation, and you may not be in the position of having a choice at all. Try to take good care of yourself and don't feel like you have to pretend that everything is ok or 'act like normal', which is advice I got from a lot of well meaning people. That's just gas-lighting yourself and adds extra stress, in my unhumble opinion :) Good luck!! Where in the country are you?",

They all seemed completely unsurprised that it came back low (9), said it was all concordant with my pathology, and never mentioned chemo again.

It's protocol to follow up, and it's good your imaging center did that. Sometimes the follow up mammogram and ultrasound alone can rule out cancer, sometimes they may need to send you for a biopsy. That's because cancer cannot be confirmed by imaging. So don't panic if they send you for a biopsy either. On the other hand, almost all breast cancer diagnosed by routine screening mammograms (as yours would be if it does turn out to be cancer) is early stage cancer - very treatable with excellent short term and good long term prognosis. That said, the waiting sucks. Hang in there!",

It's unlikely but possible. In that situation, a doctor who would otherwise have avoided chemo might recommend it. Different doctors have different standards for when they even order the test. If you know that no matter how it came back, you'd not want chemo, and you'd rather not know, I think it's fair to trust that. It's really great that medicaid is covering it, though.",

In fact, going through this process is so nerve wracking that for years, doctors wouldn't even send young women for mammograms/biopsies, because the chance of cancer is so low that they thought the negative experience of further imaging wasn't worth the stress. DUMB. Because although it's very rare, it's super important to catch it early when it happens, and because women can handle it. You can handle it, you will handle it, you *are* handling it. There is a thread here called \"Interpreting your report\" where one of the members who is a radiologist very generously will help us understand our reports. But unless you have questions about yours that your doctor didn't answer, in your position, with the biopsy so soon, I'm not sure that will really be helpful. The point of a biopsy is that they can't definitively rule cancer either in or out with the ultrasound alone. If you can, try not to read too much into the doctor's face. You never know what's going on in someone's head. Maybe he just remembered he forgot to sign his kid's permission slip form or something. Or someone talked to him recently about being more empathetic to patients and he thinks that means putting on a concerned face that he hasn't finely tuned enough yet. Waiting for results SUCKS and it always will suck. Do what you can to get through to the other end. I will say that it sounds like chances are this is nothing concerning and you have a good medical team for being so prudent, and if it is cancer, chances are it early and very treatable (most cancer found based on a lump alone are still early stage) and you will find the strength the get through (and the boards will help).

I'm single and independent, and I knew my friends would be a great source of comfort and support for me. I got an outpouring of kindness on that post. When I got the malignant results about two weeks later, I texted my father, my siblings and my two closest friends. I also commented on the FB post to let others know. For me, I can't imagine going through this in a secretive way. It would have have added a ton of stress for me. On the other hand, for other women, it's the opposite way around. Being private with the information is much less stressful for them. You should do whatever feels right to you. The only thing to be careful with, I think, is speaking with children or teenagers (if you have them). I don't think that means waiting until a particular time, necessarily (depending on their age too) but just in how you frame it and the emotional tenor of your conversations with them. You can't trust the size too much on the imaging, you only get an idea from the mammography/biopsy/MRI. 6ish centimeters would be considered large. If it is cancer, then depending on the profile of the tumor (which the biopsy will give you information about), you are more likely to be recommended chemotherapy before surgery to shrink it. Depending on the size of your breasts, the area/location of the cancer, and how much it shrinks, it's possible you'll be recommended a mastectomy instead of a lumpectomy. But all of that is things you'll have to discuss with your oncologists, after they get the information from the biopsy. The enlarged lymph node could be cancer or not. Either way, they will probably check more of your lymph nodes for cancer to get an idea of whether they should treat your lymph nodes for cancer too (either remove them or radiate them). In general, a larger tumor and lymph node involvement would indicate a higher (though still likely early) stage than a smaller tumor without lymph node involvement. But so very much depends on the characteristics of the tumor (determined initially by biopsy and sometimes revised after surgery) and what they find when they biopsy your lymph nodes. Whatever the biopsy reveals, they have so many different treatments and approaches. The important thing will be to find an oncology team that you have confidence in. Now would be a great time to start doing legwork to getting your file to an NCI Cancer Center for either your first or second opinion. It's usually some phone calls and paperwork to make sure they get everything they need. Call them first, they'll likely have an intake number listed, and they'll tell you what to do. It might also be a good time to research your work medical accommodation options and your health insurance coverage. Now is also a really good time to be very kind to yourself, cut yourself as many breaks as you can, lean on friends and family for whatever support feels right to you, and distract yourself when necessary by any means that works for you. I mean, now is probably not the time to take up smoking for stress relief, but if Oreos every day helps you get through, or dumb but addictive phone games, or binge watching reality tv, do it and don't feel guilty. How did the ultrasound go? They told me right after my ultrasound (which was right after my diagnostic mammogram) that I should schedule a biopsy. They didn't tell me and I didn't know to ask that my mammogram/ultrasound rating was Birads 5. That means that they believe it *is* cancer, but they need to biopsy it to be sure. (Even Birads 5 has false positives). I had no inkling how serious it was, and I really didn't get spooked until the night before my biopsy. In retrospect, I think ignorance might have been bliss. On the other hand, I wish that I'd had someone to tell me after my biopsy that my malignant results didn't mean I should start planning my funeral. I was too scared to look on anything on the internet. It was my first meeting with an oncologist that really calmed my mind. It is so good you have found BCO. This is a great place for information and support. You can also send your family or friends here to read and research either to help you or to help them understand how to be supportive of you, or what's going on with you without needing to ask you questions you don't necessarily want to deal with. If it is cancer, you will be opening a whole new book of learning. Tons of new vocabulary and acronyms. It's not really possible to know it all at once. Trust that you'll learn what you need when you need it. Some people are into becoming experts on it as fast as they can, other people would rather just ask their doctors what they feel they need to know. Both ways are fine. We each have to do this our own way. Sending you",

For a whole bunch of very good reasons, I followed through with the radiation, which is excellent and well-proven treatment to prevent recurrence. But it did help that she told me that no, mastectomy after lumpectomy is not a guarantee. She said that it had been the convention of care for a while, but it is not because of the radiation. The dose they give the breast is far lower than the lifetime maximum, so they *can* generally radiate again. She told me that more and more, doctors are offering second or even third lumpectomies, with general success. She said that of course it depends on the exact nature of the recurrence and the history of the patient. She said that cosmetic impact had also often been a concern, but [some] doctors are now willing to be more open to the idea that some women might prefer asymmetrical breasts/differently shaped breasts to completely losing her breasts. I don't know really anything at all about your new diagnosis. I had pretty bog standard IDC with about 4cm of DCIS. But based on that conversation it seems to me that if your doctor can't give you a compelling understanding of why he would prefer a mastectomy (and he may be able to!) then it would be worthwhile seeking a second opinion.",

It doesn't have to do with the age of the cancer, just when you happen to discover it. The doctor couldn't really explain.

Generally, the doctors assume that if you're not having symptoms elsewhere, then the cancer they are treating is only in your breast. Especially if it has not spread at least as far as the lymph nodes. Basically, you're in a position that the doctors do not suspect active metastatic cancer, and are not looking for it. That's a good thing! They trust that most likely they have identified all the cancer to be treated, and that they will be able to pick up based on future symptoms if there is cause to look for metastasis in the future, and that there is nothing different they could/would do for you medically right this second even if scans did pick up something. On the other hand, the breast MRI could lead to them doing something differently *now*, so they are doing it now. For example, they might recommend a mastectomy or a double mastectomy, instead of a lumpectomy or single one; they might do a lumpectomy for a larger area; they might do a biopsy of a different area while they are in there anyway; they might be more suspicious of lymph nodes; etc. Medical understanding of the metastasis process is changing, so now doctors think that it's actually possible that certain cancer cells *do* leave the breast early and find hiding spots in other parts of the body where they can lie dormant for years or forever. Right now, we don't have great ways of finding those cells, and no special ways of neutralizing them even if they were found. That is a pretty active area of research that I hope they will make progress on. One of the things they think that ongoing hormonal treatment, like tamoxifen for ER+ cancer, does, is to help keep dormant cells anywhere in the body dormant. I agree with Bella2013. One of the hardest things of wrapping my head around this whole cancer thing is that it is actually a long process. I wanted to deal with everything at once and get it over with, but it's not like that. You are constantly waiting. Waiting for the mammogram, waiting for the biopsy, waiting for the pathology, waiting for the surgery, waiting for the results, waiting for the oncotype, waiting for the appointment, waiting for the scan, etc. And it all feels so incredibly urgent to US, but most of it, most of the time, is not that medically urgent. So now, it's not considered medically urgent at all to have a full body scan for possible metastasis, because the overwhelming likelihood is that it's not there, and there will be plenty of time to scan later if and when it's indicated and could have an impact on treatment. I'm sorry about your diagnosis, and I'm glad you're on the Boards. Hang in there! It's a SLOG.",

Cancer discovered via scheduled scanning is unlikely to be stage IV. IF the biopsy comes back malignant (with 5 there's a good chance it will but it may not), and IF the doctors think there's a chance that it's spread, then they'll order yet more scans, and you'll have to wait for those results to know for sure. No matter what, you have more waiting ahead for you. The waiting is excruciating and terrible. We are here for you. Do whatever you need to get through the days, including asking for pharmaceutical help from your doctor if you are open to it.

The plus side is that young women didn't have to go through these scary weeks that you are going through. The downside is that while breast cancer is young women is very rare, it can happen and when it does, it makes a big difference to catch it early. Some good doctors have started actually treating these issues more seriously. It sounds like you have a good doctor who is being prudent with your health.

The oncologists strongly recommended it. Some of their points were: the survival/disease-free rates are just as good or better than mastectomy; more women report better quality of life after a lumpectomy; more surgical procedures (e.g. if you have reconstruction) each carry their own set of small and larger risks. Some other factors that pushed me in that direction was thinking that if I was going to have a recurrence, I'd much rather have it in my breast than in my chest wall. Which is more or less where you get recurrences with a mastectomy. Also, my surgeon was on board with doing more intense screening if I wanted it (and hopefully insurance covers it) - so every six months I'd have either an MRI or a mammogram. That would maximize the chance that a recurrence would be caught early enough that it would just be a hassle but not be life threatening. Finally, the MRI my surgeon had me do before the surgery did not show any other incipient areas of concern - sometimes they could reveal something in the other breast that could be DCIS, or more potential areas of concern within the affected breast - that often tips women towards MX/BMX. Also, I realized that I was feeling really sad about not having my breasts any more. I also think that a person's financial/insurance situation can play in. For example, if someone has good health insurance now but is concerned they won't have it down the line, I can see how a BMX could be a prudent move. That said, I think every woman has a different relationship with her health, her breasts, etc. There is no objectively right or wrong decision, only a well informed and thoughtful decision.",

That could help with the process. It seems to me that this new article from February about the spread of breast cancer calls into question the universal usefulness of axillary nod dissection. In your position, it's something I'd want to at least ask my doctors about and see if they had a thoughtful answer. I know more about IDC, since that's my diagnosis. With 1c, which I think means it hasn't spread to lymph nodes, lumpectomy+radiation seems to have not only equivalent but actually ever-so-slightly better outcomes to mastectomy. Again, not a professional and no personal experience with ILC. So take it for what it's worth. I think I'd definitely want a sentinel node biopsy (only takes a couple of lymph nodes) to verify whether the cancer has spread out of the breast at all, before committing to a mastectomy, and I'd be wary of the axillary dissection in either case. Also, as far as I know, mastectomy is always an option later. Like, they do a lumpectomy and then a bit down the line you realize you'd have preferred a mastectomy, or they find something that indicates it. You can go back and do it. If you're far enough out from the cancer, you may even be able to do the mastectomy and reconstruction all in one shot, instead of months of wait in between, which I think could be easier on an emotional level and maybe on a physical one too. Definitely something to at least speak with your doctors about. Good luck! Keep us posted.",

They do it just in case. For me it has definitely been the hardest part of the surgery in terms of recovery, pain, etc. In retrospect... if I had to do it over again, I might think twice about it. I would probably go through with it again because I think I would have a harder time knowing that there was some potentially pertinent information I didn't have and that my prognosis was not based on as much information as it could have been. But I would have considered more carefully. Almost 5 months later, I still have numbness in my right arm, still have some fluid/mis-shapenness around the scar, still have some discomfort. I'm pretty sure none of it is LE, but I will still be asking my doc about it on follow up. I've read on here about a woman who opted against the SNB. From what I recall, she had to go back and forth with her docs on it a bit, but they have to respect it and eventually they were willing to things her way. But yes, everything you've written sounds extremely correct standard of care. (I had a radioactive seed put in the day before).",

In your shoes, I think I would want to really understand what the doctor thinks these lumps are, if not cancer, what he expects to happen or not happen after 6 months that would give a hint in one direction or another, the potential adverse consequences of waiting - if it turns out to have been cancer, and what next steps you could take now to rule out cancer. In my experience, it can be aggravatingly difficult to find a doctor who will take a woman's questions, and especially a young woman's questions, seriously. If you have a doctor who does, that is wonderful! go to them and keep asking until you feel like you understand and can make an informed decision about your healthcare (i.e., whether to put it on wait and watch mode, investigate further now, do genetic testing for possible cancer-related mutations, etc). If your doctor isn't taking your concerns seriously, don't take it personally. It's not you, it's them. Look for another doctor or be the squeaky wheel until they engage with you, whichever you think has a better chance of working. When you feel like you've got enough information and understanding to make a decision, make the best decision you can and make the best of it. That's all any of us can do. No matter which way you go now, there will be more nerve-wracking waiting (whether it's for the next 6 month ultrasound, or for the genetic test results, or the biopsy results, etc). It's hard to live with it for anybody, check out so many of the threads on this board. But all you can do is be your own best advocate and take care of yourself as well as you can (and can chat here or to your support system when you need some extra help)!",

I would want to ask about options for conservative treatment plans. Get the tumor out, check the genomic characteristics (oncotype). If it's aggressive, re-visit, but if it's low risk, consider that the whole picture (small HR+ tumor in a woman 80+) is likely to be not aggressive, and go with that. TBH, I might even want to revisit the mastectomy part. Lumpectomy is much less invasive and lower recovery time than a mastectomy, and unless it's in an unusual location or there are other complicating factors, lumpectomy should be an option.

I'm guessing that your experience of this is compounded by your very fresh grief, and maybe shock if it was a sudden stroke. That makes it so hard. Do you have any family or friends you could go stay with for a couple of days, or who could come stay with you? It might feel better just to not be alone. If you don't have a therapist, now would be a great time to set one up. Losing one's mother is a BFD. From the cancer perspective, I'll say that my story started out a lot like yours, and for me it did turn out to be cancer. That doesn't mean it will for you! But it also turned out to be early stage cancer, which yours most likely would as well. It's treatable and I've done the active treatment and now I'm struggling with the side effects of the hormonal treatment. It's annoying as hell but it's not doom and gloom. I have many friends with one kind of chronic illness or another, and now I have my own version of it too. On the mother front, I'll say that especially in the beginning, I used to light a candle that smelled good and write letters to my mother in a journal I bought for that purpose and sob. Mostly they were just sad and repetitive, but they helped me feel the feelings and I needed to. When I was cried out, I'd take a shower and usually go to sleep. If researching the lump is feeling comforting to you, go for it. But if not, find something else that is, or do what you need to do to feel the feelings. Being scared is ok. Missing mom is ok. Feeling alone is ok. Feeling not ok is also ok. ",

I mean, I'll keep saving for retirement. I feel like my breast surgeon really glossed over the long term mortality part. Is that a surgeon thing?

Some they'll probably be able to answer better, and some the medical oncologist will. It's also a great time to ask any questions about physical or cosmetic recovery from the surgery.

I'll say that the longer I live in a woman's body, the more I'm surprised by the changes and variability that no one ever warned me about. I thought you grew up and had a status quo and that was pretty much it, but no. Anyway at your age especially, a lot of breast changes and lumps are completely developmentally normal! Still, it is never too young to build up a good relationship with a gynecologist and understanding of your health. Is health insurance/costs an issue for you?

The genetic counselor can do a telephone/facetime appointment with you to talk about genetic testing, what it can't and can tell you, understand your mom's results better, make suggestions about follow up for you, etc. They have the most expertise about genetic situations more common in the Jewish community but their mission specifically includes everyone, and I'm confident that if they think they don't have the expertise to help you, they would help you find someone who could. Don't feel silly about calling. Their social worker might also help you think through talking about it with your mother. Which I think could be really useful and good for your relationship at some point when you're ready. I also had a genetic variant of uncertain meaning. That means they've identified that it's unusual but they don't have a grasp on what it does - does it increase my risk for certain things? Lower it? They have no idea. What fun and useful information! (not). So I'm storing that knowledge away and getting on with things. In the end, life gives us what it gives us.

I was wondering if I could 'backwards engineer' the ki-67 that way. Playing around with the info from my pathology report (100% strong estrogen, 90% moderate progesterone, grade 6 Nottingham), it is impossible to come close to my oncotype score even if I put the ki-67 at 0.01%. The 3 equations go 12 (eq3, which ignores the Nottingham),14 (Eq1, which uses everything), and 16 (eq 3, which ignores the ki-67 - and is the only one I could calculate without entering a ki-67). So I don't think ki-67 can really be determinative. On the one hand, these are all too high. On the other hand, 18 and under is considered low risk, and they are all low risk, so for practical purposes of deciding chemo or not, it would have got me to the exact same place. They don't send the whole tumor to oncotype... so oncotype is getting, I think, more of a biopsy sized part of the tumor. My biopsy pathology was definitely more favorable than my lumpectomy pathology - it was higher PR and only grade 1. So I was a bit worried that oncotype could also be deceptively favorable. On the other hand, DNA is DNA. Right?? I wish I had more science background now. But my DNA from the tiniest sample or a large sample should be the same, is that accurate?",

So for children for example, you can be careful to be composed, not show panic, share whatever positives (with my students I told them that it is a very common type of cancer, doctors deal with it all the time, and I'm getting great care) you have.

So in that sense it's hard for it to be wrong, but it might not be so helpful. You could have a low birads score but it's cancer or a high birads score and it's not cancer. I think that's why they'll use it for deciding whether to schedule a biopsy or whether to tell the patient to watch and wait and rescan in x months, but not necessarily share with patients. I didn't know about them until after my biopsy confirmed cancer. Then I looked back and yup, my birads was a 5 - the highest you can get without clinically confirmed cancer. But I couldn't really have done anything differently in the meantime anyway. Maybe set up an alternate doctor with a more reliable fax system to get the results sent to. So that's why I'm not sure whether it's good or bad to have the score. Based on some posts see here, lower scores don't actually relieve women of worrying. Tomorrow would be great! I had about a week between them and then over a week to wait for results of the biopsy. I hate waiting.",

I don't know if they are technically flashbacks, but some sort of time travel anyway. It's definitely pushing many emotional buttons for me, and it's been really hard. I seem to have got lucky and caught it quite early, and it has favorable prognostic markers. The doctors have been as reassuring as I think they can. But I think this background makes it harder for me to believe them. And of course, now I am also facing all fo this without the help and support of my mother (and largely on my own - single no kids). I'm so impressed by how fast things have moved for you so far. I had almost 3 weeks between when the lump was found and the mammogram/ultrasounds, then another ten days before the biopsy, and then about 10 days after that to get the results. I didn't really start getting scared until before the biopsy but I think that's because I didn't see or understand the birads results from the mammogram. So, bonus? If you didn't already have genetic testing for mutations that are known to impact breast cancer, I guess that you will be getting them soon. Maybe worth asking if your gynecologist can prescribe them while you are waiting. One warning is that my insurance (after the fact) told me it wouldn't cover them without accompanied genetic counseling, so just to look into. This is so hard. A friend just shared this article with me that's about current cancer patients facing anxiety waiting for test results, but honestly I think it applies also to those of us with the trauma of it in our immediate family. Maybe it will be helpful a bit for you: NYT: Tackling Cancer Anxiety (if paywall is an issue, apparently an incognito/private window may help). Do what you need to do to take care of you. If this is cancer, it will be a marathon and not a sprint and you'll need all the rest nd mental/emotional bandwidth you can manage. If it's not, and hopefully it isn't - 4 isn't 5), then it'll be over pretty soon. Hang in there!",

I think palpable means that they are feeling something in the nodes that might be cancer. They will send everything for pathology and then you will have the full report. Even after that, the doctor might send for an oncotype or mamma print test which would take more time to get the results. The waiting time sucks so much. Nothing to be done really, plow through however works for you. If they do find cancer in the nodes, it still doesn't necessarily mean chemo. And if they don't find cancer, it doesn't necessarily mean no chemo. My medical oncologist sends for oncotype even if someone is node negative and small tumor, and will do chemo if it comes back high. So you really still don't know. Hang on and take care of yourself!",

Sometimes the obvious cause of anxiety is not actually the underlying cause. I wonder if there might be other things going on in your life that your are anxious about, and these breast changes have become a sort of focal point for it? That kind of mis-triangulation is definitely something that can happen. Taking some time to think about other possible causes could be very rewarding. All that said, finding a change that concerns you and bringing it to the doctor is exactly the kind of self-care that we should be doing, and don't let anyone make you feel guilty or alarmist for it. It's almost always better to just see a doctor that you trust, rather than going down the rabbit hole of googling and self-diagnosis.

      "Content": "Jan 8, 2019 10:58AM - edited Jan 8, 2019 11:01AM by Salamandra I'm so glad you're getting a second opinion! FWIW, I'm being treated at MSK and I've been very impressed. Based on my reading, it seems like the trend is away from surgical removal (they call it axillary dissection) for positive nodes and towards radiation only. The evidence shows that it's equally effective with much fewer side effects. So it does make me nervous that your doctor is assuming that surgery would be the next step. I'm sure there are cases where it's warranted, but I think a second opinion on ALL of it is a really good idea, and keep asking questions and making them explain until you are really confident you understand and they make sense. I got a little frustrated with my breast surgeon too. She gave me the impression that I would only need the oncotype if I had positive nodes, and if not, I would get no chemo without the oncotype. Later the oncologist said no, either she spoke badly or I misunderstood, and if I had had positive nodes my oncologist might have skipped the oncotype and gone straight to chemo (I'm young for breast cancer) but with negative nodes she always sends for oncotype. Well you know what - I did not misunderstand. The surgeon was clear. Me, my friend in the room, and my friend on the phone taking notes (who is an MD) all heard and understood the same thing. I think that it's a division of labor thing. The surgeon is the expert at surgery and screening, not at decision making about genetic testing and chemo. For whatever reason, the protocol seems to be that the surgeon is the gateway into cancer treatment, the first doctor many of us see, who gives us the first explanations and introductions. My surgeon gave her best understanding and guess about what would happen after she was done with her initial role, but she didn't *know* and it's not her job to know. She sounded super confident and sure because... well, I think because that's how surgeons are.... Yep, everything *can* change after the surgery pathology comes back. Usually it doesn't, and if it does change, it doesn't change very much. But it *can.* My surgeon definitely didn't really prepare me for that. And in my case, it wouldn't have mattered because for me it actually didn't change. But because I'd been doing my own reading and education, I learned from other sources that it could have, and that undermined my trust in her. But I get it, they can't tell us everything they learned from years of school and practice and experience in a two hour initial consult, they have to pick and choose and focus on what they think is most important at the time. Don't feel like you're doing anything wrong. I feel like the doctors aren't really trained in the art of educating patients and the psychology of it. If you're not understanding, it's likely more on your doctor than on you. And I don't say that to blame them. They get thrust into that role, but probably ideally there would be educator specialists with a deep cancer knowledge who would be part of the initial process and first appointments. It's OKAY for surgeons not to be great at that part of the job as long as they're great at the medical/surgical part. But we still have to make sense of things. I've found these boards super helpful for that. (From my understanding, what medicine thinks about positive nodes is changing too. Now it understands that nodes is only one way the cancer *can* spread, finding it in nodes doesn't necessarily mean it *has* spread beyond the nodes, and not finding it nodes doesn't mean it *hasn't* already spread to be waiting dormant in other parts of the body. They treat the nodes (whether dissection or radiation) to keep it from spreading *from* the nodes, but it doesn't mean they were wrong about your tumor being low risk. You can have multiple positive nodes and a very low oncotype/mammaprint). Anyway, like I said, I'm really glad about the second opinion, and keep pushing as much as you need to, to understand. Don't let yourself feel rushed or pressured. Keep asking questions here and try to do what you need to do to get through this objectively head-spinning time - whether that's distracting yourself or immersing yourself deeper in cancer scholarship. Do you mind if I ask, are you located in the NYC area? There are a lot of really good hospitals around here.",

One thing I wish I understood better at the beginning was how incredibly unlikely it was that I would have metastasis (when the lump was discovered without any other symptoms and still pretty small) and how good the prognostic rates are for early stage cancer. It will be a tough haul, if it is cancer, but you will find your equilibrium and get through. You are not doing this 'to' your daughters, there are so many things in life we can't control and cancer is definitely one of them! You can set them an example of how one can face something scary, act through the fear, and stay loving and open. That can be a precious gift too.",

I'm so glad you are going to a different care center. Do you have someone you can call on to get your pain meds for you? If not, then NSAIDS (Advil, aleve type drugs) are often helpful for that kind of pain, and you can take a pretty high dose. I was sent home after oral surgery with 800mg pills. If nothing helps, do you have a friend you can FaceTime with? I found that the most distracting when I was in pain I needed help from. That or putting on an audiobook that I'd read a bunch of times before and loved, just enough to draw my mind a bit away from the pain but not too demanding of attention. I'm so so so sorry you are dealing with this. I hope it's not cancer. But for heaven's sakes, even if it's not cancer, it's something they should have been so on top of years ago! It's disrupting your life! You should not have to be dealing with it like this.

My radiation oncologist also assured me very seriously that there would be no radiation to my heart or lungs. Now, your tumor is much smaller than mine, and in your left breast. And you may have other health issues that are impacting treatment. But I guess in your place the first thing I'd want to know is whether the radiation oncologist was confident he could do whole breast radiation without hitting my lungs and heart. Then, I'd want to hear whether and why they would consider partial breast irradiation an equivalent alternative to whole breast. If they can't explain to your satisfaction, I think that would be a good enough reason to for me to go with the tried and true whole breast radiation option. (Disclaimer - I'm just another layperson). (To me partial breast irradiation seems like the worst of both worlds - the drawbacks of the limited treatment area associated with intraoperative partial breast irradiation but the hassle and side effects of the regular whole breast radiation. Unless there is concern about radiation to hearts or lungs, I would be pretty wary of it. But I am a complete layperson and this is only my impression, and I'm very glad to read other opinions and experiences).",

That's great that you only have to wait a week.

She recommended a lumpectomy+radiation for me, and said that the survival outcomes are statistically slightly more favorable with L+R in a case like mine than with mastectomy.

But it's not like an ear infection and you take surgery/radiation and it's gone. Some people are saying, oh it's six months of terrible and then it's fine! And I think they mean well, and it's either ignorance or wanting not to dwell on bad things, but it's getting irritating. People say ER+ and especially both ER+ and PR+ are good types because they are more responsive to hormone therapy. From what I can see, they have better early outcomes, i.e. we are less likely to die in the first 5-10 years. Which is good! But whoever survives the first 10 years, regardless of tumor pathology, at that point the chances sort of even out. And it's possible to have an initial cancer that's hormone receptor positive, take care of it, have it never come back, but then have a new occurrence that's triple negative, or triple positive, or just Her+. I don't want to borrow trouble, and I'm so glad I have a place to talk about it with other stage 1 people, because I'm sure that to more advanced stage people it seems like a great problem to have. But I still have to wrap my mind around it somehow. My surgeon also didn't send my samples to the oncotype lab until after my first follow up. Initially my surgeon was being very confident that I wouldn't need chemo, but then apparently they decided to send it off. My surgeon came recommended and I think it's possible she was a really great surgeon, but there are definitely things in her office communication that I wish were better. And her office is also telling me she won't write a medical note for me once the initial surgery recovery is done, even though it's weeks until I meet my next doctor, which feels like BS to me. Cancer is a global thing, not just a surgical thing, and theoretically it's all under the same hospital and a treatment team, no? But then, I haven't actually got to speak to the surgeon since before the surgery - follow up was with her NP. Which also feels like BS. I think I need to be more insistent, but who has the energy/time for that! It's taking everything I've got to keep showing up for work!

I went to a new gyn to get it inserted, pretty randomly, someone in my neighborhood who took my insurance and had availability. She offered to do a breast exam and found a lump. The ultrasound radiologist and the breast surgeon both gave her kudos on that 'pick up' so I guess she now has a loyal patient in me, even though I don't like the rest of the practice. I'm more or less on my own. My biological mother died of breast cancer when I was 20 (yes, it has made this whole thing traumatic on a whole other level) and my co-mother had very debilitating dementia for years before she passed away about six months before I was diagnosed. My siblings live halfway across the country. Most of the time I'm not lonely. I'm so lucky to have truly wonderful friends. One of them made me a radiation care package with a little gift for every single day of treatment!  I did take off of work. I changed careers into teaching a few years ago (high school special education) and though I like it and I'm so grateful for the health insurance it is providing me, I didn't have the physical/logistical/emotional capacity to deal with the treatment and the intensity of the workload at the same time. Treatment is about fifty minutes to an hour in the opposite direction of my school, no car. (Live and work in Brooklyn, go to MSK in Manhattan). I'd started bicycle commuting to work this fall and now I'm bicycle commuting to radiation. I have a scaredy cat who nevertheless makes life more interesting. Friday I had the door open for her and a raccoon came in and sat on my bathroom mat. My neighbors dubbed it Moisheh the Hannukah Raccoon.  I've been reading a lot about breast cancer and trying to take care of my mental and emotional health too. It's been quite a year. I really hope I'll be in shape to not hate going back to work when it's time. And I still hope I'll be able to put my IUD to it's proper use at some point! Even if dating isn't something I have much energy for lately :) My doctors wanted me to remove it since it's hormonal and my cancer was HR+. But it was more on general principle than specific data. I feel like somehow it represents my sometimes tenuous connection to normalcy, and also a good luck charm because it's responsible for my cancer being found now rather than until whenever I started regular mammograms (which should have been at 40 but who knows if I'd have actually done it promptly). So I'm keeping the damn IUD. I did the surgeries, I'm doing the tamoxifen and radiation, but I'm not going to have periods too if I can help it. Anyone else play Pokemon Go, and want to be friends? Or Boggle? ",

It seems to me the data must be out there, but I suppose it takes a lot of labor and resources to calculate it. I think doctors and insurance companies consider radiation and tamoxifen/AI to be relatively very low risk/impact interventions with strong evidence of *general* efficacy (i.e. across stage 1 in general), so they aren't necessarily motivated to push so hard on getting women out of it. The furthest they've gone is to suggest that women 70 and up *might* skip radiation. Local recurrence rates with lumpectomy alone are pretty high, even for low risk. The evidence for radiation preventing local recurrence is very good. Is it worth it just for that? At first I didn't think so, since the evidence shows that the benefit for overall survival is real, but not very high. But then, has all been such a pain in the neck. I feel lucky that my surgery went well cosmetically, but how many times do I want to risk that? And the recovery from the SNB is still annoying. Plus who knows whether my health insurance will be as good in the future, and how stressful this would be to try to deal with, if I had crappy health insurance. Even if it were 'only' a local recurrence. (I also suspect, as letsgogolf said, that the high risk of local recurrence is at least somewhat related to issues with needle biopsies, and I wish there were more straightforward information on that). The tamoxifen, it's so similar. The doctor says 50% reduction in risk. Also says my risk is low anyway. It made it hard to get motivated to take it, especially reading about some of the bad side effects people have. But I also read/heard of plenty of people having no or very mild side effects, so I figured I should at least try it for a while. Pushing on me I also have that my mother died of estrogen positive breast cancer. I also notice whenever someone on the boards who didn't take ant-estrogen drugs at all, or for just a short time, has recurrence. Is that statistically meaningful? Probably not. It's likely intense confirmation bias, because who comes back to the boards after all. But it helps me feel better about the decision to try the tamoxifen. In the end I think it's just what we can live with. Doctors see lots of patients who all have different health situations and risk tolerances, and it's much simpler/safer for them to push the 'safest' known route. It took a LOT of studies and validation before doctors felt safe enough to rely on a low oncotype score to skip chemo, and compliance is still not universal. Hopefully in the future we'll get tests similar to oncotype to pre-determine efficacy of radiation and hormone treatment. But for now... ",

I don't know that much and you didn't really ask a question, but in case it's helpful, this is my understanding? ER+ means that you will almost certainly get prescribed something to suppress estrogen (probably tamoxifen if you are premenstrual, AI if post). You take it long term to reduce the likelihood of that kind of cancer coming back. Now they are saying 10 years. ER+ HER- means that there's a chance you may not have to do chemo. At least that's my understanding, that basically everyone with HER+ or with triple negative gets chemo. But if you are hormone receptor positive, then depending on the characteristics of your tumor, you may or may not be recommended chemo. That may be a pretty long wait to know for sure - for me it was the very last piece of the puzzle after the surgery. What kind of oncologist are you meeting next week, do you know if it's a medical oncologist or breast surgeon? Do you know anything more about the size/grade of your tumor?",

If it says 9mm tumor, it sounds to me like that was the actual tumor size. But you may have to wait for final pathology to know for sure. In any case, under 1cm and under 2cm are both considered early stage, so it would not change her staging. Usually women get 'neoadjuvant' - meaning before surgery - chemo if the tumor is very large or if it has certain hormonal properties. I could be wrong but I think this is most likely for triple negative cancer, where ER, PR, and HER are all negative. For hormone positive cancer, especially as early as your mom's, there's a good chance she won't need chemo at all, and they need to take out the tumor and test it to check. Staging can definitely change after surgery but it can also stay the same. Mine stayed exactly the same - my surgeon made an accurate prediction. In some cases, staging can actually get better after surgery and more testing. For example, if someone has a large tumor (I think up to 5cm) but surgery shows clear lymph nodes and their oncotype score comes back 10 or lower, then under the new guidelines they would be stage Ia, even though before surgery a tumor that size would be at least stage II. Remember that staging is prognostic. It's predicting what may happen in the future. So even if staging goes up, it doesn't have any certainties. Similarly, even if it stays the same, it's no guarantee that your mom will be safe forever. This brush with mortality is hard for us to wrap our heads around. But it sounds like your mom is absolutely early stage. She isn't dying now. Eventually she will, we all do. Enjoy each other in the mean time! Hang in there!",

We women have all different kinds of relationships with our bodies, with our breasts, with illness. Hearing about others' experiences can be helpful but it only takes you so far. I suspected I would have a genetic mutation before I got genetic testing ten years ago. I suspected the doctor would recommend mastectomy to me (completely unfounded) when I was diagnosed this year. At both times I thought I had mentally and emotionally prepared myself to lose my breasts. And maybe I had done as much as a I could. But both times, when the doctor said I could keep them without additional risk, what I felt was great relief. That tells me that my heart didn't want a mastectomy if it could be avoided. Even if it meant extra stress and hassle with screening. The science around breast cancer is pretty good now but it is not perfect. We still have to make hard choices with uncertain outcomes, that we will pay for one way or another. I think that the head plays a vital role in gathering and evaluating information and evidence. But ultimately it has to be the heart's decision. Because your whole body has to live with the outcome. I guess that a prophylactic mastectomy is probably a bigger deal than a prophylactic tonsillectomy or appendectomy. But to be honest, I wonder how much surgically and medically the risks differ from something like a face lift or facial cosmetic surgery - like, an elective operation directly on a person's face! That many people do voluntarily. And there is so much more *health* justification for mastectomy. Anyway I guess that is all kind of a long way of saying, use your brain but listen to your heart.",
