I'm pretty good at researching medical findings and I actually love reading that stuff. Problem is, this subject has quite a few conflicting theories. I read mri's are not great at detecting benign lumps and then I read they are. So frustrating! I guess my question is if it's benign... Then what is it? And could it be pre-cancerous cells? Just a lot of unanswered questions.",

Went to gyn, she sent me immed to ultra and mammo which showed 2 suspicious areas so they sent me immed to MRI. It showed benign??? Didn't know an MRI could determine that. I thought only biopsies could. But anyway now they want to monitor the lump and repeat an exam in 3 months and repeat mammo and ultra in 6 months. I just have a weird feeling that everything is not ok. But it could just be my nerves. Anyone else have similar experience?? Also, I'm 41, a mother of 3 with a pretty healthy lifestyle with no real BC history. Log in to post a reply",
