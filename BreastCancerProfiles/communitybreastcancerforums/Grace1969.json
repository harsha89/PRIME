The evening of October 4, I noticed increased pain, swelling, dizziness and redness extending from my breast, up my chest to my neck. Went the the hospital's ER, that perform my wide local excision and was immediately admitted, rushed back to surgery, due to internal bleeding. There was 400 CCs of blood sitting in my breast and I lost another 100 CCs during surgery. My hemoglobin level dropped to 7.8. I stayed in the hospital for two days. I'm doing better, still fatigue and emotional. I didn't receive any drains during the first or second operation. I'm a little concern now, because I can hear fluid swishing around in the breast. Is that normal? No pressure, no pain and a little swelling.",

Also, I will be under general anesthesia for the tumor removal, but the Dr asked if I wanted a block administered before I'm knocked out, to help with the pain once I come to. Any insight? Should I get the block? Has anyone else gone through a simililar scenario?",

Now, I'm in this position of uncertainty and I need support, encouragement and reassurance, but he has totally checked out, since we were informed about the abnormalities. We have kids to take care of and we both don't have the luxury of checking out. He's gone to all my appointments, which is great!!! I'm doing the comforting and talking. I haven't seen any post addressing this issue with spouses. He's not a big communicator, so I don't know how he feels. Any insight or advice is more than welcomed. Log in to post a reply",
