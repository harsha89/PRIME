That happy juice is a wonderful idea:) I'm am battling the emotions that come with the thought of how my chest will look after and what it's going to do to my self esteem seeing I can't have immediate reconstruction so I too will ask for some extra happy juice. Thanks for the tip!!! More appreciated that you know:) Amy",

Decided to go for Breast Conservation therapy and all that means is Chemo first rather than Surgery to TRY to shrink the tumor enough for Lumpectomy. I did five months of Chemo and and headed in for a mastectomy next Thursday. All I know to date is that I have stage 3, Grade 3  , ER +,IDC. My understanding is that a TON of information will come out of pathology after surgery. This includes lymph node involvement and scientific info regarding the risk of metastisis. I did, immediately after diagnosis have a chest xray, ultrasound of lymph nodes, and bone scan before chemo but I believe that those were basic tests to look for an obvious spread of the disease.  Bottom line is,my belief is that they really don't know for sure what we are dealing with until after surgery. Any and all, correct me if I'm wrong. 6 months into this and I'm stilling trying to put all the pieces together and understand. Amy",

Unfortunately they play a big role in how you feel. For instance, they kept me up all night the night before chemo. They kept me up all night the day of chemo then I ran around like a nutjob the following day cleaning the house like there was no tomorrow! Lack of sleep is of course an issue for anyone but they did a number on me by the time the chemo side effects kicked in the days following where I crashed and burned and felt like someone beat my entire body with a stick. The Hair: It was suggested to me by many to shave it once it started to fall out. I waited two days then got out the buzzers. Best approach I think because it was less painful than watching it fall out daily like something from a horror movie. Just a suggestion...:)",

Not knowing what to expect is so scary but after reading everyones posts it doesn't seem it'll be too bad:) I would like to know though... Am I correct in thinking that I will have all the answers about my cancer after surgery? ie Chances that it spread? I just went through a bit of a freak out for a while worrying about the fact that all the answers are yet to be had. (Didnt understand this at the time of diagnosis and guess I was preoccupied during the last five months while I was going thru chemo and dealing with the side effects). Lol I guess my question is...Is there chance that it spread and they don't know it yet till after surgery when pathology comes back? I mean really, 6 months into this and they don't even know if it's in my lymph nodes!!!",

That has put a damper on my being able to bask in the glory of being done with that. I know that it may not happen but just the thought of it is a bummer. I should try to take on your attitude that you have no control and you will take it as it comes:) I know worrying does me no good but its in my nature before cancer and it certainly isn't working well for me now ! lol. Im so glad to know that most were pleasantly surprised that the surgery wasn't as bad as they had anticipated. That helps me to face it now that it's FOUR days away!!! Boy, until yesterday I was going through this feeling that no one fully understand my fears, emotions and concerns. Now here, I feel that EVERYONE does. Thanks for being here for me.

Maybe the frequent bouts of crying should have clued me in but they gave me Ativan. Easy to use that then just chill. I truly have been TRAMATIZED by this surgery. I didn't expect it and certainly didn't see this coming. The strangest part is that its not on a concious level. For instance, i see my chest and think, \"yeah, so what, its ugly but you'll have a better set later\". but this feeling I have coming from deep down within is like something horrible happened to me on that table and though I don't remember it, I am aware....I'm asking myself if something else happened WORSE while on the table during surgery because this TRAMATIZED feeling doesn't seem warranted in my mind. Really, it's just a boob. If I don't take the Ativan I am very irritable, sad, pissed off and don't want to talk to anyone. If I take the ativan, I calm down and rest. Has anyone felt this TRAMATIZED feeling after their mastectomy?",
