On a suggestion from a friend I purchased a Bali Comfort Revolution which fits very much like a sports bra but has a back closure. This bra did fine for me while I was recovering at home but once I got back to routine, I needed something with much more support. It was very difficult trying on bras a week after surgery. I ended up finding Champion Spot Comfort Full Support was the best one I could find that was comfortable yet supportive. I tried both these bras on at Khols but I bet they are pretty common in other department stores (I did not find them at walmart). Khols didn't have the size I needed so I ordered some from Amazon (much cheaper and they shipped quick). I'm returning a few that didn't fit but I'm very happy with my bra now. Just wish I had had it a week earlier.",

I'm feeling tired all the time and I'm thinking its because I'm sitting around on my butt doing nothing most of the time. I wish there was more contact with my surgeon. I actually haven't heard or seen him since 5 days post op. I've talked to others at the clinic about a week ago but I would love some regular reassurance I guess. Sometimes I wonder if anyone would call or follow up if I didn't. Like 2 months from now would anyone ever say \"Hey - did she ever get her drains out?\" I am trying to set up a 2nd opinion on this whole thing just for peace of mind.",

They said they will most likely fill me on Monday at my appointment They have explained it to me that they hope the fill will close the open space and slow down the draining. They did not however commit to pulling the drains. I'm thinking that answers going to be no unless something really changes with my output between now and Monday. I'm not holding my breath. I only had the mastectomy. No radiation or chemo. Here's a funny thought for today: You know you've had drains too long when you start lining your bra band with overnight maxi pads to try to stay comfortable. ",

I feel like I \"may\" have some accumulation but it doesn't seem bad. I was filled 120 cc on Monday too. I haven't felt too tight or sore but tonight I'm feeling tighter than I was. I'm not too worried. After my BMX my drains were pulled early at say 5 due to a malfunction. I did develop a series on both sides. It wasn't horrible - just a bit uncomfortable. I did delayed reconstruction so I had nothing to fill at that time. At first BS used compression in the form of a really tight ace bandage. After 3 weeks it got uncomfortable and he aspirated 100 cc from one side. The other resolved. It didn't hurt to aspirate. Just weird. He aspirated one more time a couple weeks later and then it was done. I hope you have better or similar results. Just keep in touch with your surgeon. ",
