      "Content": "Ailish wrote: My story, my mum and her 2 sisters have had breast cancer. My mum and her twin are both out of remission but my other auntie has had breast cancer three times and she is now about to have 'the big operation'. My mum told me that there is a chance that I could have the two genes that cause breast cancer. However she said I should wait till I'm about thirty to get tested,(I'm nineteen now). Lately it's been on my mind a lot and I want to go and get the test but I'm scared about so many things, like finding out the results then having to deal with that, telling my parents about it all, deciding what to do about it.  However on the other hand I want to put my mind at rest and at least then I will know for now weather I do or don't have it. What would you do? What would you tell your daughters if you were in my mums position?  Thank you for taking the time to read this Log in to post a reply",
