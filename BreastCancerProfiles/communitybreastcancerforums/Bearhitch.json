Couple that with extra weight and you have a bulge of sorts. I also feel like I am not totally flat and so some shirts really do NOT help hide that. The other day in Target I got an idea to try on some spanx as a shirt and was amazed at how much it helped smooth out the look while I continue trying to lose weight. The only problem is - I felt like a stuffed sausage and was terribly uncomfortable so I was wondering if anyone knew of a product like it that really just focused on the bust area? Granted - on the tummy is needed, but I will probably only wear that for special occasions. Any thoughts? Log in to post a reply",

I actually never got a prosthesis - my surgery costs never reached my deductible and I figured I would never wear them anyway why bother spending the money? I was a DD prior and so, I could give you a list of all of the issues I no longer deal with (sweating under the boobs, back pain, shirts not buttoning, etc). As for what I wear, I still wear tee shirts around the house and out and about. My surgery was in May so, it took me a few months to adjust to the appearance. Something I found helpful was discovering there are actually women whose bust were so small that they looked flat and that gave me comfort. I was surprised how no one really seemed to notice. Now in some shirts it is. The one thing that I dislike is I have gained some weight and consequently my tummy sticks out more - or it just feels like it, because there are no boobs there to make it evened out. So - what to wear!? What I have found is I dress the complete opposite of what I used to - I used to try to minimize my bust and now I am maximizing it. Which means little over shirt cardigans look best being shorter instead of longer, patterns on the bust or stripes are better, layers are awesome, scarves and bold accessories are awesome! I actually had started a Pinterest board of things that match this for style to help give me ideas - like I said, dressing in a way I am not used to. Oh and for the record - my surgeon was not impressed with my decision to not want implants. I was so young and the only people she had ever not want it were 60+. She highly encouraged me to talk to a plastic surgeon so I knew my options and that.... I knew that my surgery - being a prophylactic - there would be days I would regret doing it. But I have never regretted not getting implants. They wouldn't be mine and I had no desire to deal with them.  http://www.pinterest.com/bearhitch/post-mastectomy-style/",

Finding shirts is probably the trickiest part for me, so when I find one I like - I buy more than one! My whole shopping on a budget and being frugal at this point has taken a back seat because I am dressing a whole new body and my options are not the same as they were - so finding one that fits and I like and it looks good is not taken for granted. Part of this has been quality shirts. For example the shirts at Target rarely work - the fabric is thinner and just lays differently whereas Kohls have a very nice fabric, fit nicely and just look so much better. For example - this shirt. Great shirt. Lays nicely - has colors and that broken up on the chest area which helps give the illusion of not being flat. Plus it is a fake layer which I love. http://www.kohls.com/product/prd-1803562/ab-studio-colorblock-marled-mock-layer-sweater-womens.jsp?skuId=AB+Studio+Colorblock+Marled&search=AB+Studio+Colorblock+Marled&submit-search=web-regular",
