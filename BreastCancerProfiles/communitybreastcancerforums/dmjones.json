I had a little discharge, no cramps though, and generally felt pretty darn good.  Maybe after going through a year of breast surgery, chemo, radiaiation, and a parathyroid surgery, made the hysterectomy seem like a walk in the park, but I just don't think it was a difficult surgery. I wasn't medically permitted to drive for 3 weeks, although I went back to work (and drove) 7 days after the surgery. I already had chemo induced menopause, and I'm also on Tomixifan, so I already had the hot flashes going on, so I don't think that could have gotten any worse.  But, if this reduces the chance of me ever hearing the big \"C\" word it's worth every flash that comes my way. You'll do fine..",
