      "Content": "hlm1987 wrote: I accidentally stumbled upon a lump in my right breast. It is appx the size of a pea and is on the outside of my breast. It is easily palpable when I have my arm raised above my head but much harder to feel when my arm is by my side. I am obviously concerned but don't want to \"overreact\" either. I thought that it might have something to do with my period but that has come and almost gone with no change to the lump. I am 26 years old with an Aunt who was diagnosed with BC in August. I do not have insurance so I am contemplating the wait and see approach (even though it is driving me crazy) or should I go ahead and have it checked out? Any advice would be greatly appreciated! :) Log in to post a reply",

Our local hospital couldn't get me in until November 7th so she wanted to check around. She got me in on Wednesday of this week at a neighboring hospital so that was great! Because of my age they want to start with a diagnostic ultrasound and go from there. Because I don't have insurance they told me to check in to my state funded Breast and Cervical program that would pay for my testing because I have a \"mass.\" She used that word which made me worry a little more.... I called the health dept and they said that I would be covered but basically I would have to start from scratch and see the NP and then be referred for testing. The only problem with that is the first available appt is November 14th. So, I have left a message with the hospital asking about pricing for the ultrasound and if it is not crazy expensive I am going to pay out of pocket. If not I guess I will be heading to the health dept. on the 14th.",

I called and asked and they said that even if I went and paid for the u/s myself and that something was wrong I would still have to start from scratch with them in order for treatment to be covered! Thanks again!! I went to my appt on Thursday and she ordered an ultrasound for the 18th and a surgical consult for the 25th. Her description was \"abnormal breast exam. palpable lump at the 11 o'clock position appx 4cm from areola. Appx 1cm, movable, longer than wide and non-cyclical.\" Can't wait to get this over with.",
