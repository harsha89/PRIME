I had a lumpectomy, with a \"sandwich\" treatment.  3 treatments of chemo consisting of Adriamycin, Cytoxin, and 5 fu, followed by 7 weeks radiation, then 3 more treatments of chemo.  I was given extra doses of radiation because of a hospital confusion. The surgeon said he took out all lymph nodes (negative) and sent them to the pathologist in 3 cassettes or containers. The pathologist said he received 3 lymph nodes. The radiation oncologist saw the error and it was decided that since I was getting all treatments available, extra radiation doses was the only remedy, to make sure no lymph nodes were left and cancerous. I also had 5 years of tamoxifen. Do you think overkill?  Now 18 years later I am experiencing severe left breast fibrosis with major dimpling at the lumpectomy incision site, hardening and swelling of the breast.  I thought my cancer had returned but negative. Also having stabbing left chest pains occurring occasionally. Now 2 years after the onset of the fibrosis I am having shortness and trouble breathing, dizziness, tired with no absolutely no energy.  I had all heart tests including cardiac catheterization angioplasty.  All negative.  Except for a positive chemical induced stress test. Now they will look at the lungs.   With the left breast complications and now the increased size disparity I am looking at a double mastectomy, my choice this time! With cosmetic surgery this time.  Even tho I live in major metropolitan area with major hospitals, I was never given real choices in what treatment to have.  If the different possible treatments had been discussed I would have had a double mastectomy without any other treatment. I am grateful for my life, but all the side effects from the chemo & radiation have had a significant effect on my health. Has anyone experienced side effects becoming major health issues years after the treatment? I don't know where to go, since no one seems to know about this.       Log in to post a reply",
