I was kicked in my lower left breast in Feb. by my 3 yr. old nephew who was throwing a fit and a lump transpired. After mammograms, ultra sounds, MRI`s, and a core biopsy the results were in...  and I have gone through one surgery so far. I had a partial mast. with two lymph nodes removed. Results came back that one of the nodes has cancer and that I did not have clean margins. I am now awaiting the results to see if I have inherited the BRACA gene and have a scheduled bone scan and CT scan set up next week. I am freaking out and am shocked, angry, scared, frightened, and in a fog! Who knew a kick in the breast would result into all this. I am here for you whenever! We`ll get through this I promise!",

It will not be as scary if you are focusing on other things. Think mind over matter! I know this helps me. Good luck and I say it`s ok to keep up with the happy hours! \\",
