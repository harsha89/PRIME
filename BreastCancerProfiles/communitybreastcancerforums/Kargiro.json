The area in question is very deep and would not show up on mamm and u/s, the dr said she wasn't concerned and to follow up mri in 6 month to see if it grows. I'm concerned with this plan because why would you make this decision based on a less sensitive test knowing the area is too deep to capture an image any other way. That doesn't mean it's not there. I plan to ask primary doc about mri assisted biopsy. I have very dense breasts and don't want a scarier situation in 6 months. Thoughts, experiences? Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Kargiro wrote: I was having pain in left breast for a few months, dr scheduled diagnostic mammo with u/s. Did mammo on both breasts but u/s the one with pain. Dr said debris in milk ducts- probably papillomas. Scheduled contrast MRI on both breasts. Results said both breast have multiple benign cysts, HOWEVER MRI showed an 11mm (1.1cm) suspicious \"area\". Have to wait a week to get diagnostic mammo and u/s on right breast. If MRI is so sensitive to say the cysts are benign, what am I to think about this area? I hate waiting, let's plan an attack and get on with it. Log in to post a reply",

I just looked at it again and under the 11mm were the letters T1. Everything I searched re T1 means cancer. Is that what that means? They just read off words assuming I knew what they meant. What does that mean??!!",
