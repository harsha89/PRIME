When the Tech finished, she went out of the room to show the Radiologist what she picked up on US (guess that's how to explain it). The Tech came back in and said the results would be sent to my Dr. I looked at her and said, isn't there something you could tell me about the results? She said the 2 nodes deep in my chest wall loooks as if they are cysts and that the Radiologist who did the MRI said if they don't see anything suspicious, then I would do the 6 mo. follow-up MRI to evaluate them. The Radiologist never came in to personally talk to me. I don't think that is right to do to a concerned, worried patient, and of course, I didn't ask to speak to the Radiologists personally either. I  am not a \"pushy\" person. I will however, go to pick up the reports when it is ready instead of waiting for my Onc to call me. I am never going to her office again due to my prior experience with her. What advise/information can you give me about this? Since I had previous lumpectomy in the left with ADH, and one of the nodes is in the left (deep and cannot be mri-guided biopsied) should I demand a biopsy? I know that things can progress in a 6 mo. time period and that concerns me especially if they think it is something that would need to be re-evaluated in 6 mo. as opposed to dealing with it now. I feel like it's only a matter of time before they do end of giving a diagnosis of cancer because they like to do the wait and see. I just don't really know what I should say or do even though it is my health they are dealing with.",

Washout kinetics are demonstrated. The nod shows high signal on T-2 weighted images. In the left breast, there is a 0.4 cm enhancing nod in the posterior 2 o'clock, adjacent to the chest wall.

Absolutely amazing to say the least. I know we all over-think these findings, it's hard ot to. I think it's a way we prepare ourselves for the worst. I did call and bump the appt from the 22nd of Nov. to this Friday!!! I have to go out of my way to another location, but the sooner, the better! I was asking myself how in the world was I going to wait that long. I lose weight when I worry or stress, and very easily, which is not good because I am already underweight. Blessed with a high metabolism and hyperness!! But, if I waited that long, I would have surely lost about 10 lbs. I hope when I go in Friday that they tell me \"something\" about what they see. I can't figure out why I keep having these scares and to me, it would be easier for them just to take em' off and not keep fooling around. Everytime I go, mammos, etc. they have to take me back into the room again for additional views and that scares me! So I am hoping Friday I will know something. I don't like my Onc and am getting a new one. I went on my own to get the report of the MRI and had it before the Onc. I waited a few days and I called her! She was at a different office at the time but she actually told me that everything was fine with the MRI and I didn't need any additional tests. She didn't even read my report!! A few days later, she called me and told me that she received an \"Addendum\" to the report and that I needed a 2nd look US!! I knew she would call after she \"actually\" read the report, but she tried covering up by saying there was an Addendum. I knew that I was done with her at that point! Horrible Drs. are out there and it's sad that we have to dig through the bad ones to get a good one!  But, the good news is this Friday is the day I will have even the slightest piece of info to go on! Please tell me how have you been? And thank you for coming back to support me!",

I just said yes and didn't ask him any questions. When a person goes for a consult, you think, ok..I'm just gonna sit down in the regular chair and the Doc and I are going to discuss things, but I was wrong. I had to have yet another breast exam which I am so tired of. The assistant hands me the smock and tells me to undress-waist up. I said,\"this is for consult only, not an exam.\" I was a bit rude in my tone. So, on the exam table I go. The Dr. started telling me about being awake to have a wire put in?? I told him I have a clip and he said something about not being able to see the clip or something and that;'s what the wire is for??? Anyway, I said, \"oh, you can see the clip..I can, it's right here poking out of my breast. I thought it was supposed to. He makes his little humm sound and says..wonder why they did that?  So, I don't ask any questions because I don't want to think that a mistake was made on me. Scary to think something's wrong, so I forget about it and move to the next conversation. \"When can we get this done and over with?\" Next week good for you Doc? So, Thurs, the 27th is the day. 11AM. I'm at the point now where I feel like all of this is just part of my every day routine. Like I'm just going through the motions. I'm not even worrying at this point anymore.(Not much anyway) Funny thing is that at that consult, I was ticked about having to have another exam and when I left, I felt like I was going to cry, but decided against it.  Julie, you're gonna do well today.

Thanks for the step-by-step, I have a clear picture of what to expect now. The unknown is no fun for any of us. I had my MRI done this am., just got back into work. It would be really nice to have a few more compassionate people in the health care system. I had the MRI w/solution (intraveous) and all of that was fine. While I was in this machine for about 10 min. everything was fine and then I felt a flush of fluid/wetness at the IV site, but with my head being turned the oppossite direction, I couldn't see it. I thought maybe I was bleeding from the needle because all of a sudden I felt that gush at the site. I somehow figured out that someone was putting more \"stuff\" in the IV, but without telling me what they were doing. Had they told me, I would not have laid there for 5 min thinking I was bleeding..maybe the needle slipped out?? Who knows. My imagination was going a bit wild anyway and I figured..if I was bleeding, someone would eventially notice. No communication in that big tube. We can either have the nicest, most compationate people around us, or have some who act like patients know (somehow) what to expect without being told.  I'll be glad to get back in the office of my regular Dr. who is so great!! So next up for me is Thurs. 27th's excisional and then....take it from there. Very soon Julie, we will be \"in the know.\" We will both know what we are dealing with and what us women CHOOSE to do about what we are dealt. We know we have to be patient, we know it takes time, we don't want someone to rush through looking at our biopsies and making hasty decisions, we want them to be patient, and so WE WILL GIVE THEM TIME. We must be patient. When do you expect to hear something?? You're gonna enjoy your weekend right!! Girls..When you hear B9, yell out loud...\"BINGO!!!!!\"",

I have a ton of things to do before Thurs.'s excisional...obtaining films, getting blood work, EKG, physical, etc. I will be glad to be done soon. I hope all results come in quickly. I do know that at some point I have to take that stuff call Tomoxifen. I hear some people get hot flashes...that might actually \"even me out\" because I freeze if it's under 80 degrees.  It's nice to hear from you again. Take care",

I am going to have MRI and the excisional and the Dr. is scheduling things for me. She said it will be asap and all of this will be over. On another note, she said if there is no cancer lurking with the ADH, she wants to put me on Tamoxifan for 5 years. She said sometimes this can cause hot-flashes and weight gain. The weight gain is what I need because I have high metabolism (it runs in the family) Lucky yeah some say, but thin people are ashamed of bones showing just as weighty people worry about their appearances. I feel much better even now knowing that the samples from the stereo were ADH with no cancer at this time. If it turns out otherwise after excisional, I'll deal with it. If need be, off with the boob(s). I know for some it's difficult, but they are not the most important piece of my body. Most often, it would just be DCIS. I guess I am the type of person that likes to know what I COULD be dealing with beforehand, figure a solution beforehand (knowing what can be done to cure in the event) and once all of the cards are laid on the table, I have the plan already in action. I feel like I know when it's time to worry, sorta like a preminition (no not psychic). With the stereo, I felt like they would find something quite not right.  My Dad had bladder cancer...had chemo and all. He became depressed because of the potential outcome. Dad was scared to die and still is. That's a fight in itself. But..I asked Dad to imagine his good cells killing the bad ones, like a bladder cell fist fight, really mentally concentrating on it. Dad did just that, and soon after that, yes, cancer killed and cancer free for 8+ years. I personally believe in that type of mental capability.   Fight everyone, never give in and never give up.",

That's pretty quick..Wed.!!  I've had a pretty busy week so far and it's only Tues. I have to run here and run there to gather films at umpteen different places. It's crazy. Today I go from some additional BW and pick up my MRI today. When I called the facility yesterday, they said the report hasn't been written up yet. I think they're full of it and don't want me to read anything into what's there. I am hoping they see the pea-sized lump on my left in the middlish of my breast that IS palpable, but could not be seen on any of the films/US. It's there and when my cat walks on me at night to get herself comfy, I cringe.  If it didn't show up, then I'll take their word for it that it is some kind of chondo???(bony area) I am going to ask the BS why (and someone here may know) if there are calcs on the left AND right, they are just working on the left?? If they find yuck on the left, I'm assuming they will then check the right? A little of this and a little of that. Sometimes that's good, but we like the all-in-one, get it all and tell us immediately what it is. I just have to trust them. Just think Julie, when you wake up tomorrow, you'll wake up knowing that you are going to know your results that day. I have to be at mine on Thurs. at 11, so I'm gonna try to sleep as late as I can. No coffee, no cig (yeah, yeah, yeah, I know-bad) I'll be working on that issue after this one's done. I'm not telling anyone when I attempt to quit, that way I won't hear neg. if I slip. If I do slip though, I'll keep trying until I succeed. I think about it every day. It's difficult, but... I wonder now if when I go pick up the MRI, the report will be in there. If it's not, wonder if I should worry about whether it is being kept from me??? Angel10...Angel, I'm glad to hear you are feeling better each day. So what do you have to do next other than rest and fully recover? How long do you think (estimate) it will take for me to get my excisional results back? Do you have any advise on what I should ask the BS and other staff prior to the procedure?  Thanks all of you for your support and encouragement, your knowledge and prayers.

Julie..glad yours turned out well and no cancer was noted, but I would do the same as you..ask why there's no mention of the radial scar. It's unfortunate that the Dr. mumbled and you could not understand. The 9th is a long time to wait again.  I am still sore. I think my pain tolerance has diminished w/age. I have my Grandson's blanket to prop my arm when I go to sleep. Later in the day, I notice I ache a bit, but I guess that's to be expected. I have stitches in which will be coming out soon. I didn't remove any bandages because that skin on that side is loose..flimsy and I don't want to pull and possibly tear anything. I do have a nice sized bulge though which I'm sure w/go down in time. I'm fortunate that I've not received any \"bad\" news but am so prepared if I do. I think so far, I have been in good hands/care w/the Drs. and hope it stays that way.

Yep, you heard me 2 hours on the table. My calcs were difficult to get. The radiologists said they got 4 of the calc, but not the rest? They put a marker in...guess they always do. He had to numb me several times, and I DO have a high tolerance for pain. The way I had to lay on my stomach wasn't bad. The part that nearly killed me was my shoulder got cut in the circle area. The positioning that they had to do required me to be extended like that. My boob doesn't hurt..I didn't need any ice on it at all, but I did on my shoulder. When he finished and they got me out of that contraption, I layed on my side and cried like a baby. Guess I finally got emotional. That was my 1st cry. I am so blessed though. My precious brother, he is so forgetful, but 3 weeks ago, he remembered me telling him I had to go for my biopsy, so I wake up to his missed call and he asks me what time the procedure is. I said you don't have to go with me, I'm fine. He said I know, but I want to go. Meet me for brunch and we'll go. He sat during my biop for 3 hours- waiting for me, his OLDER sister. This man doesn't have 10 min in a day to spare, but he had hours for me. I am so blessed.  On another note, I did get to see the specimen, it was green, lots of blood and a few white circles. The green thing was very big. I didn't ask what it was because I really didn't want to know, but now I do.  So, I was told to get dressed and wait. The tech said the Radiologists likes to speak to his patients in his office. So I go in, he shows me some films and told me he wasn't able to get all of them. It said it was very difficult because of the location (deep) and that I would get a call back today. I don't want to scare anyone about pain with a stereo biop., but I guess it all depends of the patient and the Dr. The staff and Radiologists were as sweet and supportive as can be. They were all great caring people and they pampered me. The one lady rubbed my back and the Dr. kept talking to me during. He encouraged me that I could do it and continuously told me I was doing well. And I was thinking about calling it quits while it was going on because I was having a very difficult time bearing the pain. But thanks to everyone, I did it. Juliecc, Angel and everyone..thank you sooo much. ",

And do fight with the insurance company and maybe your Dr. can state the why your MRI WAS a necessity and help you in that cause. As for family history, I am hearing my Grandmother had several cancers and one being breast. Usually from that side of my family, every one has a view of what my Grandmother had.   I just hope my MRI was reviewed PRIOR to the excisional so that I can KNOW that the mass was removed. I will find out, but will have trust in my Dr. if not.  I am feeling very relieved that ALL diagnosis is going to be given to me ON Thurs. I am so ready to face and work with whatever I may find out. I know that if they find a mixture w/ADH, all of this will be so beneficial for my daughters in the future to be tested early on. I guess even w/ADH, that could cause them to be tested early as well? I will be there for them to make sure their Dr.s know that they may be high risk and they will never be ignored about their health concerns. ",

I wish I had known a few things before having my previous excisional done;specifically wanting a Breast Surgeon Specialist to do the procedure instead of a \"General Surgeon.\" It would have been a good idea for me to have gone to Hopkins instead of the hospital that was \"assigned\" to me. I did not have the knowledge to \"pick and choose\" properly. I followed directives, but now I want Hopkins to take over. Wish I would have done that in the very beginning, especially since \"now\" knowing that ADH/DCIS is very difficult to distinguish. I have NOW learned..Lots of knowledge and lots of questions are the key to making sound decisions.

Do you still have to take Tamox even after you've had a BM?  I am curious about how many people on these boards started out w/ADH and then eventually, BC. And how many people w/just ADH had BM's as a preventative. A survey would be interesting. Covertanjou, in my opinion, if I were in the same situation as you, I would go for the surgery so that I would have peace of mind and not have to worry whether a medication is working or not. Having to make the decision about the Tamox knowing what the SE's are..very scary. We can sometimes believe that we are having a SE just because we know what the specific SE's are. Sometimes it's better not to know.  Have you ladies had your slides re-read to confirm the previous diagnosis? Do you all know how to go about obtaining the slides? Hope you all had a good weekend!!

Claud2stl: If I were you, I'd schedule an appt. with your Onc to find out if you should take another round of Tamox or some other type of medicine. That way you don't feel like you are at a \"stand-still\" just waiting for something to happen. Take charge of your regimen to ensure you are doing your part to prevent any problems.  Covertanjou: So with 2 different diagnoses, did your treatment plan/follow-up stay the same? Leaf: I see that your reread was a different diagnoses as well. Did your plan stay the same? Guess we have to decide whether we want to believe the lesser of the diagnoses? Questions, questions. My questions arose because of the script I received and knowing the SE's from the Tamox. I am wondering whether it's worth the risk for me. I figured something out today anyway.",

I decided not to fill it asap, but want to wait until I am absolutely positive about my choice.  I take a high dose of atenolol (heart) which has a blood clotting SE. I question now the higher risk of blood clots. I will speak to my cardio before taking Tamox. I have read, unfortunately, that ADH and DCIS are closely similar.

I don't want to doubt anything, nor be ignorant about not taking care of myself any longer.  As far as the hospital being reputable, I once had doubts about that hospital. I know of several people, as well as myself, who've gotten poor care. I do believe that they've since changed. I also know (now) that a BS should have quite a bit of experience. I don't know about mine, never asked. I talked to a person at Hopkins for a re-read; Hopkins is very reputable. They have a special center for breast issues. I would feel confident with their decision. I would also consider their recommendations on my regimen.
