Please, help me to get thru this until I get doctors diagnosis. I am a mom of two beautiful girls 15 months and 8 year old. I am 33 years old myself, been healthy all my life. Had progesterone injections with my second baby and a miscarriage prior to that. GOD BLESS YOU ALL! Log in to post a reply",
