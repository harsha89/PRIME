      "Content": "Sep 27, 2012 03:51PM - edited Sep 28, 2012 12:46AM by linnyhopp I made an appointment with my wonderful wig stylist (who is a 10 year colon cancer survivor) about 2 1/2 weeks after my first TCH.  I had already picked out a wig and she had it ready for me. I hadn't had my hair cut or colored since before my diagnosis so it was pretty ratty and it had begun to fall out by the handful.  I decided that the hair would be gone on my terms when the fall out began.  My husband went with me to the wig stylist's home (where she does business for medical patients only) and to be honest by that time I was resigned to losing the hair, but definitely not happy about it.  My DH had a much harder time then I did.  I didn't watch as she buzzed my hair, but he did and was so emotional.  I really do think the anticipation of going bald was actually worse than having it happen.  Now that's not to say I have been happy about it, but I somehow came to terms with looking like Shrek!  I do have some hair now but it's fuzzy and very gray.  I tried to dye it last night...still looks gray, so I guess it's the wig for me for awhile.  Andrea, I know you will make it and will still be the same beautiful person inside.  Remember the bald look isn't permanent! Take care...Linda",

My hair stylist's sister has BC and warned me that the bangs would be the slowest to actually look normal.  It's really true because as she had said, it takes a long time to grow over your forehead!  As I posted earlier, the hair on my crown and the bangs look very dried out and \"fried.\"  Everyone keeps telling me how good it looks, but that's probably because of two things...1st - they love/like me...2nd - their hair doesn't look that way.  But, I have to say that I do feel lucky since some women never have regrowth. But, I still hope as time goes on my hair gets a better texture!  My husband told me last night that only I see it that way and told me to get over it...you can only imagine what I was thinking, but I managed to try and be humble. Lago ~ I did go to Walgreens and looked at the generic product you mentioned.  The label said it would have to be used all the time to keep regrowth happening.  Do you use it on a regular basis? I am glad so many of you are seeing progress on the regrowth.  It seems like it takes forever, but it will happen eventually...both eyebrows and hair.  The only bad part is that when it does return you will have to shave under your arms and your legs, but I can tell you it's something I am grateful for.  Take care all and happy hair!",
