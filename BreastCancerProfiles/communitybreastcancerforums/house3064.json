I had my first mammogram two weeks ago, which then resulted in a digital mammogram, ultrasound and then core needle biopsy. Yesterday, I was relieved it was B9, but a bit concerned by the lack of information to help me make an educated decision. When I asked what my options were, I was told we could watch it or remove it. My doctor said since it is a rare diagnosis he wanted to personally stop by the breast surgeon's office to discuss my case. So, I am waiting once again to hear back. Everything I have read confirms what Marie has posted. However, it also indicates that each situation is different. Some have tumors that grow rapidly, while others stay the same size or smaller. Others have pain, while some do not. What I have learned is that we need to look at our individual case and determine what is best for us. In my case, I am leaning towards removing it. I will keep you posted. Hopefully you will do the same. It is a bit comforting to know we are facing the same thing at the same time. Best of luck, Susan",
