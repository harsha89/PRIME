Trust me when I say that things will get better. Look at this as just 'shock' and with any shock we get thrown totally out of sync. Same as when a loved one passes or we witness a terrible event etc etc.  the absolutely wonderful thing is that you are onto it now and sounds like they aren't mucking around (even though every day at the moment probably seems like waiting a year) and absolutely fantastic that there doesn't seem to be any other spread. So look at those positives and know that you and your hubby can find the strength to get through this. You never know how strong you are until being string is the only choice you have! We are all here for you and any question, thought, worry or joy we will help and laugh or cry with you. You are going to be ok for a long, long time!!  Once again big hugs - put those big girl pants on and show everyone how brave, courageous, positive and strong you can be! K xox",

Found lump on 1 January, doctors on 2nd, mammo, ultrasound and biopsy on 4th and found out it was cancer on 7th. I think you just have to trust that your breast specialist/surgeon and the team are making the right choices for you as per the information they have in front of them. I too ended up having a lumpectomy only. My BS said if he thought I should be having a mastectomy that's what he'd say or suggest. And he said - which is true - you can always start out smaller and go bigger if you need to - but you can't go the other way. You just have to bear in mind that once you have surgery and pathology reports come back - treatment options can change depending on results etc. So you can have a 'best plan\" but it's subject to change depending on what they find. They are the specialists dealing with this all the time, so I decided to go with their advice. All the best with your surgery. And it's ok to shed some tears - it's a very emotional time and its hard to stay strong all the time.",

      "Content": "Jul 16, 2014 09:31PM Kruise wrote: hi everyone I have a question - for the past month or so I have had lower back pain. I have suffered from this in the past though. I have had a prolapsed bladder too which was operated on 3 years ago but has since been problematic again. However it also feels like my hip is involved now too. But then I just ache everywhere in general. I have put on weight since chemo, have gone through menopause with it as well, and get out of bed in the morning stiff as a board. I feel old!! I can't stop worrying now that my cancer has returned and I know I shouldn't pre-empt it but I just feel so achy that it's not right. Does lack of estrogen bring on these aches? What does cancer 'pain' feel like? I am going away next week with my children for their last week of school holidays and hoping I'll be better by then but I guess if not I just have to go back to doctors to get tests. I just really don't know if I have the energy to cope with all that hospital stuff again. Part of me wants to put my head in the sand. It's getting to the point where I can't ignore the pain though it starts affecting quality of life. I haven't really taken any anti-inflammatory meds or other pain killers to see if that helps either. Any suggestions or advice appreciated.",
