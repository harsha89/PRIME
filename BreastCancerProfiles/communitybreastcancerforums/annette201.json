I just finished the prep where they tattoo three spots on you, no one told me I was having this and was just surprised with the needles, wished they would have explained it a little better. Said would start radiation next week. To be prepared for skin peeling and uncomfortable. I got some 98% Aloe Vera spray, but also think I need something else. I am 69 years old. Lucky to have found very early stage, not in lymph nodes, low grade1, Stage 1A. .9 Mm. I am trying to prepare my self for the worse. I have very large breast 40D. I am worried. Had a Lumpectomy. That went very, very well. Did wonderful, never even needed pain medicine at all. The needle from the tattoo bothered me more. So I am so afraid of this much more. I want to make sure I use the proper cream to protect myself after the treatments. Can not put anthing on 2 to 3 hours before, so will put on 3 times a day after treatment. Were going to do Braceatherepy Radiation, but tumor was too tiny. Log in to post a reply",

They say it is much safer for large breasted women who have cancer on left breast. It is a preference for me to do the safest thing possible.Yes it is face down.",

Thank you so much for this info, I did not like how they stuck me with the needles and did not even give me a chance to say anything. I can hardly see these tattoos. I should start next week, You are giving me hope that it is not as bad as what they are telling me.",
