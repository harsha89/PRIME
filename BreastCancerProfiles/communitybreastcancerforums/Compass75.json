I was diagnosed 8 Nov (IDC grade 2 , ER/PR +, CerbB2 -) and had my double mastectomy on the 14th. I went in to the operation with the hope that my nodes would be clear and that I would be able to preserve my nipple in my left breast which had the malignant tumor (1.7cm) Unfortunately, at least one node was affected (my doc thinks that it is only one node due to preliminary testing during the surgery.) The full report comes out next week. My surgeon says that because 1 node was affected, the oncotype dx test is ruled out (I'm 37). Another disappointment. I'm concerned/dreading chemo and am even considering not undergoing it. Am I completely ruled out for the oncotype dx test? How about mammaprint? Any help would be great.",
