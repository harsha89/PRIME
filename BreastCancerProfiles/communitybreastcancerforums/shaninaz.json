I felt a small lump in my breast during my period. By the time I got in to my OB, it had shrunk down quite a bit. She didn't seem concerned and said it was probably a cyst due to hormone changes in my period. She also said she didn't feel anything concerning during the exam. She ordered a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound, which I had this past Monday. The radiologist said what I was feeling was probably a benign cyst, however, she found another area of concern. She found an intraductal mass noted in a dilated duct. It measures .8cm x 1.1cm x .3cm. There was adjacent vascularity. It says it is in the 3 o'clock , retroareolar region. The Birads was 4 (with no letters after). Can any of you help me interpret what all of this means? I have a biopsy scheduled in a few days. But in the meantime I am worrying myself sick.
