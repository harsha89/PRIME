    "Content": "RobynS wrote: Hi there, I recently found a very small lump on my right breast.  I'm not really sure what to make of it because it started out as a red pimple like thing and then seemed to turn into a lump under the skin.  I thought I would wait a while for it to dissappear because it didn't seem like it would stay around for very long.  It has been just over a month and it is still there.  Also recently another pimple like thing appeared just under my nipple on the same breast.  It has since started looking more like an open sore, although it does not hurt.  It has been a couple of weeks and it still looks the same. I have also been experiencing minimal discomfort every now and then in the same breast. I'm not overly worried about any of it (which might be entirely the wrong attitude), but I was wondering if anyone has heard about anything similar to this and if they have I would greatly appreciate it if you could share your knowledge with me.  Log in to post a reply",
