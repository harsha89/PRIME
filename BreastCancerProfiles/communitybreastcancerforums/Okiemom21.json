It has grown some, following my rib and shaped like a tootsie roll. I went to my PCP and she was very dismissive and didn't order any tests. A few months later and the mass had made it's way over my sternum to under my right breast. Next, several pea sized soft lumps appeared under both inframammary crease. At that point, US and mammo were negative. Just recently, I found a hard caterpillar sized very hard lump in the upper outer quadrant. I can't tell if its defined or not, as it is in a web of lymph nodes also in the upper outer breast tissue. I have significant bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy and also swollen nodes along my sternum. Can anyone pipe in with any similar signs or symptoms? Oh, and I'm a 38 year old female without significant medical history or familial history. Log in to post a reply",
