My MO used to wait until the end of rads before starting anti-hormone therapies because the belief was that you just don't want to compound SE's of rads with possible SE's of AI's or Tamox. So the old protocol was chemo first (if needed), then rads, then anti-hormone pills. But she said it's becoming more common now for MO's to start the pills during rads (or even before) if the patient doesn't seem to have any other comorbidities and is in good health. In my case, since I decided against chemo, I wanted to start a systemic treatment as soon as I was allowed to. I had no issues. I did 28 whole breast rads (boosts done during surgery) and never had bad SE's - no itching, no open sores, etc. Just a really dark tan rectangle on my chest (which is nearly imperceptible now. Overall, a non-issue. I have also had no real SE's from Femara and I've been on it for over 6 weeks. So every case is different and your MO will evaluate your overall condition, other treatments, etc. and decide. One good bit of advice from MO - eating healthy, exercising and sleeping well are as effective as any of these individual, medically-delivered anti-cancer treatments.

Path report confirms several things the initial biopsy measures but path. is more accurate because it's done on the actual tumor, not just a small sample of the tumor. Tumor size, stage, grade and lymph node involvement are all included. If this info isn't discussed, it's a good idea to ask about it. One of the things I asked my BS at post op was exactly what she saw when she opened me up. Interestingly I learned that she didn't see anything but healthy tissue. Since she's working to get margins of clean tissue all around the tumor, she doesn't actually see the tumor. She locates it based on ultra sound imaging and the wire they inserted the morning of surgery. She said she didn't see the actual tumor until after she removed the tissue, sent it to pathology and they brought it back to the OR after they had \"breadloafed\" it - meaning pathology sliced it up like a loaf of bread. It was then that she saw the actual tumor, a grayish-white mass of tissue. In that mass, they found the tiny little metal clip that was left there during the biopsy as a locator. (In my case the clip was shaped exactly like a Breast Cancer lapel ribbon only VERY tiny.)Finding that tiny clip confirms that the BS removed the tumor that had been biopsied. Yes, I started radiation exactly one month after surgery.",

      "Content": "May 6, 2016 07:24AM - edited May 6, 2016 07:26AM by Sunnyone22 Hi All. Random thoughts from someone exactly 2 weeks past rads: Number of treatments can vary for a number of reasons. Some rads are stronger dose. Some are smaller dose or different angle to protect underlying tissue (depending on where treatment area is located in breast). Some get \"boosts\" to the tumor bed area after whole breast rads are finished, some don't. Skin SE's are more frequently underarm due to arm rubbing against skin. My RO told me to put my hand on my hip and \"walk with \"attitude!!\" .I had 28 whole breast rads (no boosts - they were delivered in one dose during surgery) with no skin SE's except dark tan rectangle. Fatigue during rads was present but not very bad. The week to 10 days after rad fatigue was definitely worse. Two of those days found me flat on the couch. Exercise, even if mild, does help mitigate fatigue. My RO sounds exactly as Grazy described - about 5 feet 6 inches, beautiful skin, East Indian descent. And she has the loveliest British accent. I am incredibly lucky to have had such a talented, smart and caring BC team - and all of them women!!. One last thought..................rads are very doable, even though inconvenient. For me, the worst part was being reminded every day of my BC. Now that I'm two weeks out, I'm not focusing on BC nearly as much. Tan rectangle is essentially gone and skin feels the same as the untreated breast. There IS a light at the end of the tunnel - it's SUNSHINE!! (((((Hugs))))) to all from Sunnyone",

      "Content": "Mar 29, 2016 08:45PM - edited Mar 29, 2016 08:50PM by Sunnyone22 Hello all - As promised, I counted up replies to my VERY informal questionnaire about rads SE's. I got 13 responses to various questions. Here's my summary: 1. How many treatments before you started to see burn on your skin? This varied from day 1 (pink) to day 21 (burn) but on average, the replies said that most reported skin burn by days 11-14. 2. How common are open sores? Did you get them? Interestingly, exactly half of those who answered this question reported open sores and half said no. Granted, most were still undergoing treatments when they answered these questions. Sores were typically reported from day 15 thru 26. 3. After how many treatments did you start feeling tired? Nearly everyone experienced fatigue - only 3 did not. Fatigue started for some on day one (three reported this and two had just finished chemo). For the rest, fatigue was reported on or soon after day 5. 4. Are those final 'boost' treatments higher dose than your normal rads? I should have worded this question better but still, I learned from your responses that boosts, whether during or after surgery are ELECTRONS and are targeted on the area where the tumor WAS. The whole breast rads that we get are PHOTONS and are spread out daily for weeks (as we are all well aware!). Only two of us didn't or won't have boosts after whole breast rads are finished.(In my case, I received my boost dose during surgery, directly to the tumor bed - called IOERT - Intraoperative Electron Radiation Therapy) This totally UNSCIENTIFIC survey was brought to you by Sunnyone22 who, when I first asked the questions had no fatigue or 'pinkness'. Today, after day 11, I have both. Mild though and I'm fine with afternoon naps. (I might have to continue these little catnaps even long after my treatments are over. I LIKE 'em!!) Thanks to everyone",

Some of you may recall that I set up a little 'procedure' to reward myself for getting through this: four champagne flutes with 7 pink gumballs in each. My reward after each treatment was a yummy gumball. (I usually don't eat sugar so it's a real treat!). After every 7th treatment, I get a glass of champagne (well, sparkling wine.)

My RO wants me to use Silvadeen on weekend days when I'm not getting rads so I'll start Friday right after treatment # 24. About weight............ I gained about 5lbs during the weeks leading up to surgery. I think I ate every carb within a 3 mile area! (comfort food). I've managed to lose about 3 lbs during rads but I was also told not to gain/lose during rads so that the measurements don't change. My weight is normal so I'm not too worried but I am going to keep close watch on it now that I'm on Femara. (I've been on it almost 3 weeks and no SE's so far but it seems quite a few BCO women report weight gain with AI's).",

For those of you who didn't hear me when I walked out of the rad center at noon..............WOO HOO!!! (I really did yell that - right outside the door!). My rad center didn't have any bell-ringing or certificates so I had to mark the milestone in the only way I knew how. Just for the record, the apprehension I felt before going in for my last rad disappeared by the time I crossed the parking lot to my car. I am just so danged happy not to make that trip any more. But I also think it's because daily, we're reminded of our BC whenever we go in for another treatment. I'll be happy not to think about it so much. Because I had my boosts during surgery, I only needed the whole breast rads, 28 of 'em. I have a very dark, evenly colored tan rectangle on my chest but no open spots, no rubbed spots, no itching, no burning, nothing. I've been religious about applying Miaderm several times during the day and Aquaphur at night. (Even silvadene for one weekend but RO said I didn't really need it). So far, so good. I'm unsure how much worse the skin will get now that my treatments are finished, but I'll let you know. Again, thanks to all for the good wishes. Here's my final, now-empty champagne flute.

I'm the impatient type and things weren't moving fast enough for me!! I didn't have to drive far and everything was incredibly efficient at the rad center - in and out in a few minutes.

I just started week 4 of Letrozole (Femara) and so far so good. No SE's. I know SE's can start later though so I'm staying vigilant. I read your explanation for wanting to pursue chemo treatment in recent and previous posts because I, too, was interested in your logic. I'll be interested in hearing what the San Fran. onco recommends for you. My tumor was 100% ER positive but very weak PR positive (only 5%). Low PR is a concern and is likely a factor in why my OncoDX is intermediate (20) and not lower. I was advised against chemo because the relative benefit was minimal and neither my MO nor the second opinion MO supported it. Also, my BC was ILC which tends to be less responsive to chemo. It was tough to decline chemo because I wanted to throw the kitchen sink at this BC. Instead I'll focus on healthy eating and exercise (AND the AI, of course.) Whatever you end up deciding, I know it'll be the right thing for you. Barbe - I hate to hear that you fell through the cracks with your first diagnosis. You deserve so much better. It's nice to know you've got the Arimidex working for you now.",

I'm very lucky to have no real skin SE's from rads - Today is only day 5 after finishing and my 'tan' is substantially faded. No open skin or sores during entire time. But the post-rad fatigue is pretty significant. I started getting fatigued about week 4 but it really hit me about 2-3 days after treatment ended. Bad today too but I'm honoring it by hanging out on the couch in my fuzzy bathrobe. Twnkltoz - So sorry you're feeling so sad and bitter. Are you seeing a counselor or have you considered it? If there's ever a time in life when you deserve profession help to regain a positive outlook, it's after BC. You're right, of course about losing 9 months of your life but you did what you had to do with strength and grace. I hope you can find it in yourself to look forward again. Moondust - good luck with Arimidex. MO said that if SE's develop from AI's, they often go away after about 6 months so if you get any SE's, hope you can hang in there. I'm close to 4 weeks on Letrozole (Femara) and so far so good. Just some tiny, short, hot flashes. . Findaway - Good questions. I can't speak to the boosts (I had mine during surgery) but as to the whole breast rads and tanning in the axillary area, I got that too. In fact, its the only part of the entire radiation field where the skin turned a little leathery. My RO said it was like that because of the friction from arm rubbing skin of that area. She advises her patients to \"walk with attitude\" - in other words, with that hand on the hip to avoid underarm friction (and look a little bad-ass!) And I agree with Moondust about lymphedema not being caused by rads. Barbe1958 - CONGRATS!! I heard that gong all the way down here in southern California!!! Well done!",

I have a very dark patch of skin on my breast/chest but as yet, no open sore spots or anything like that. I strongly suggest that you ask your Radiation Oncologist what cream to use several times a day. There are special creams developed especially for those undergoing radiation (I use Miaderm) and my Rad. Oncologist suggested using Aquaphur (which is a healing petroleum jelly) every night. Here's a list of tips I picked up from my Winter RADS thread: RADS Tips/ Shopping List:",

I can say, though, that it sounds like intuition told you to do chemo. The fact that you felt a weight lifted from your shoulders after coming to that conclusion is, in my opinion, the best evidence that your choice was the right one for you. Anyone who has experienced an intuitive epiphany understands that feeling. My onco score was 20 - not as high as yours but still in that gray, intermediate zone. I struggled with chemo/no chemo and got two opinions from two oncos before deciding not to do it. Like yours, mine was ultimately an intuitive decision. It's one I can (and will!) live with. Day two of rads was a breeze. Got in early and got out 7 minutes after my appointment time. Hope it goes that way for the next 26 sessions! I'm chomping on my second pink gumball right now! Five more days and I get my first glass of champagne",

My RO said the treated boob usually swells a bit and then actually shrinks once treatment ends. Being a napper, you might be taking care of your fatigue issues. I was never a napper but I am now. Just catnaps but they really help. The fatigue doesn't seem to be day-long for me, just need that nap late afternoon (my treatments are just before noon each day). Gemma12 - Thanks for extra 'boost' info. Makes sense that each of our rads experiences are a bit different, base on histological type, size, location, etc. of removed tumors. Congrats on minimal SE's!!! Twnkltoz - Glad to hear your energy is improving. Being in the middle of treatments, I'm encouraged when I hear 'normal' will return after these treatments are finished. Hope your shoulder pain subsides soon. barbe1958 - So sorry to hear of your continued issues. Bladder infections are so uncomfortable. Please let us know what you learn from your renal US. I smiled when I read that you called off your rad coordinates. I can do that too because they call them off every day! Kind of like pilots calling out pre-flight checklists. Like you, I was told not to breathe any differently. I asked my RO about that and she said the initial measurements they took included the range of normal breathing and she encouraged me not to hold my breath. Can they make an adjustment for you to better avoid the lung tissue or is it unavoidable? As for your total gy's - I wonder if it's more than some of us are getting because yours includes lymph nodes and chest wall whereas some are only whole breast w/o lymph nodes, etc. What did your RO say about total gy's? I'd be interested in hearing. Duzy - So glad you're healing so well. Gives me (us) something to look forward to! Katja23 - Lucky you! Glad to hear you have no SE's. You don't really even need naps? Good point that there are probably many SE-free ladies out there who are not on the thread. Windward - about your moles......I had one pop up on my breast around day 7 and I asked RO about it. She said it was probably a flesh colored mole that was already there but just darkened as a result of the rads. I'll be interested to hear what your RO says about your new spots and skin tags. Please let us know.",

I'll use it all weekend and watch for dryness. On Monday when treatment continues, will switch back to Miaderm in daytime and Aquaphur at night. So far, so good but still 4 more treatments to go plus the week or so afterward when I'm told things continue to worsen. No open burns or sores yet but damn what a nice 'tan' I've got now! (Well, at least on my chest............ a rectangle...............) For the first time today I noticed that my irradiated breast is getting swollen. RO said that would happen and that, eventually, after it heals, it'll shrink down to a bit smaller than when treatments started.

I've found a home to commiserate with fellow rad. takers and am very appreciative. Today's first treatment went well. I'm told it was longer than most will be because they took locator Xrays plus the rad. onco came in to oversee the treatment and consult. He told me not to move and just talked to me while I was there with my arms over my head holding onto a bar and trying not to move! So weird!! It's funny how we give up any semblance of modesty when going thru something like this. Oh well........ I asked rad. onco today about the supplement question (which I first heard here on this board). He said much the same thing as others here - that I should avoid any supplement with anti-oxidents in them, including fish oil. He said multi-vitamin was OK though. I guess it's so low in anti-oxidents that it won't really hurt. I want to share with you all how I plan to mark progress on this 5 1/2 week journey. 28 gumballs in 4 champagne flutes. I get to eat one gumball a day after each treatment (a real treat for someone who has given up sugar) and a glass of champagne after each flute empties! Crazy I know but I need a bit of reinforcement each day, and I need to see progress. Here's a photo of the start of my journey:  You would have laughed at me trying to pick out the pink gumballs from the bin of colored gumballs at the candy store!! ((((Hugs)))) to all of you here.

Sorry if this post is stale. Disneygirl16 - what radiation treatment did your insurance deny? Is it the normal, 5 or 6 week rads or did you have intraoperative electron radiation? The reason I ask is because my intraoperative rad (IOERT) was denied and I'm appealing. My IOERT actually saved my insurance company the cost of 5 post- surgery boost rad treatments (and saved me the skin SE's of those extra treatments). I covered the whole cost of the IOERT because my surgeon is convinced it is much more effective (since electrons are applied directly to the open tumor bed during surgery). I'm fighting my insurance company to cover the IOERT in full (it cost me thousands of $$) but even if they don't pay me back the full amount, I still want the cost of the 5 boost treatments I saved them from paying.. Disneygirl - hopefully you'll let me know what your insurance didn't cover. Also, any others in the 'denial' fight?",

Part of me is so excited about letting out a big WOOHOO as I walk out of that rad center but part of me is feeling a bit apprehensive about life going forward. I don't think I've really embraced the concept of wondering, for years to come, if my BC will return. (Having ILC which is harder to find in imaging AND self-exam is also a bit daunting.) And although I'll be seeing my BS, my MO or my RO every three months for the next few years, I feel like I'm leaving a cocoon of caring and being released out into the not-so-caring world. For months, I couldn't wait for today, the day I go back to my 'normal' life but something tells me I'm entering a new normal. Did any of you have mixed feelings the last day of rads?
