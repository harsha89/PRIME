It's almost a year since first chemo treatment for Stage 1 Grade 3 breast cancer. I ended all treatment Janyary 21, 3013. But ever since then I get severe joint pain - major joints-ankles-knees-hips-elbows-wrists. Everyone sing along--head, shoulders, knees and toes-knees and toes... Does anyone else get joint pain? I feel like the only one. Is it psychomotor? What are you doing to relieve the pain? Please offer wisdom! Log in to post a reply",

I am sorry to the oncologists out there but I am sure this is long term side-effects of chemotherapy and radiation. I've tried Cymbalta--rash, Lyrica--rash and rage. I've tried lots of different things in between and I do not feel like the former self of vibrancy and Joy. The fatigue starts with a hollow type of pressure or drained feeling in the back of my head and goes all down my back and legs. Fibro pains attack my joints. I've gained weight. The depression I experience comes from not being able to sleep well or feeling pains after moving about! I do not like the \"poor me\" attitude but there I am in full swing. Needing a nap soon",
