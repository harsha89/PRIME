I was diagnosed in May and had a lumpectomy and sentinel node removal on 6/29. I will most likely need 5 weeks of radiation. The thing is, my wife and I have long standing and paid for plans to vacation in Provincetown Columbus week. We have not had a vacation in 3 years and have had a very rough go during that time. I need this vacation for my spiritual well being. Do you think my doctors will consider this when scheduling me for treatments?",

I have a very active lifestyle -- strength training -- power walking -- yoga, grandchildren and family activity, etc and I work full time. I felt so great after my surgery, so happy it was over, that I really messed up. While I did refrain from using my right arm and doing anything strenuous with my upper body, I resumed walking and even went to the Y and used the recumbent bike. I went to 2 family bbq's where I drank more wine that I probably should have. I definitely overdid it. This was a week after my surgery. I developed a hematoma as a result of my lack of using any common sense, it had to be drained and packed twice and will probably need to be drained one more time. I know I cannot offer advice on this site, which I just joined, so I will say that what I learned was this....before any of my follow up treatment begins, I will tell my doctors exactly what my normal activity level is, what my life style involves and I will ask specifically what and when I can resume any activity. I've been reading some of the posts on this community and am so happy I found it. Log in to post a reply",

My wife, usually squeamish, did a bang up job replacing pads and rebinding my boobs. I took a peek and even though its multicolored, it looks more like the other one. Hopefully, when I see my surgeon tomorrow, I'll be in the clear. Now onto the treatments.",
