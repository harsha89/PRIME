At 42 I was recommended to have a excisional biopsy of an atypically growing fibroadenoma. I agreed two years later, as we know fibroadenomas can grow back! So I had the lumpectomy and found out I had lobular carcinoma in situ. This only happens less than 1% of the time. I had an mri and another 5 mm finding was found it was assumed to be another fibroadenoma but I pushed for another needle biopsy. LCIS unlike fibroadenoma is a significant risk for breast cancer. My advice is stay diligent with screening! I would even try to push for an MRI. Many women with fibroadenomas have dense breast tissue and mammograms miss a lot!",
