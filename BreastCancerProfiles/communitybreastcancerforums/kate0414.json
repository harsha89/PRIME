Should find out on Monday when the culture comes back. I was starting to feel really down about a possible delay for the chemo. She says she doesn't think we'll have to delay so it's a wait and see. My daughter (28) has been staying here since March and wanted to stay long enough for the first treatment to make sure \"mom\" is all right. She has been a godsend, but she lives in California and this has been hard for her. If she doesn't work she doesn't get paid so I have been paying her bills for 3 months. Somehow money is the least of my concern (although I'm retired on a fixed budget). She doesn't want a delay because she really has to leave on June 23rd. Junebug40: I was a tough old bird from March until now, but I find I've had some bad days lately. My water heater leaked and flooded my family room in the basement and I've been dealing with insurance and workers for a week. I sat down and cried when it happened. Had a real \"why me\" moment, but it passed and I know that survival is my main concern and stress will not help me. However, after almost 3 months of no smoking, I started again. I could kick myself and my daughter is really upset with me, so all I can say is \"Let yourself have a bad day, but know that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. If I didn't think that, I would never be able to get through this. Hugs, kate",

I have very fine blonde hair and I'm hoping that as a reward for getting through this, God will give me thick curly hair. Jo, I'm so sorry your 1st time was so difficult. My thoughts are with you tonight for a better result tomorrow. Let us know how it goes. Bettina, I can only imagine what a relief it was to get the first hurdle over with today and feel good. That's great news. Hugs, kate",

Since I don't start for 2 weeks, it's nice to get some idea of what it's like from day one. I realize everyone is different, but having a thread that is specific to my chemo start time is great. I had a port put in 2 weeks ago and have had no problems with it. I did debate whether to try the veins, but decided that for me the port seemed better. I was afraid the veins wouldn't hold up and my arms would be full of bruises. I'll let you know how it goes with the port. I am shopping for wigs and luckily my insurance will pay up to $200. I've never been a hat or scarf person so I hope the wig works for me. Living by myself means I can go bald most of the time and just use the wig to go out.  It's going to be a whole new adventure. Hugs to all, kate",

Thanks Rinna for telling me about this thread and the great list of helpful hints.  To save typing I'll just copy my original post. I will be starting my chemo on June 16th. I had to have a complete hysterectomy and bilat mast in March. My chemo was delayed due to my surgery incisions opening. We have been trying to get the wounds healed for 2 months. I'm at the very end of the 90 day window to start chemo so I was getting a little frustrated. Finally, they gave the go ahead to start. Not that I'm looking forward to chemo, but I can't get past this if I can't get started. The recovery from the double surgery was a little rough, but not as bad as I imagined. In a way I'm lucky. I am 64 yrs old and my children are grown. I'm retired, so coping with the chemo will be easier for me than some of the young mothers on this site. I'm from Michigan and normally wouldn't be looking forward to winter, but my chemo should be done just before Christmas. I will look forward to really celebrating the holidays this year.  The women on this website have truly been my salvation since being diagnosed in February. I will have AC 4x and then Taxol weekly for 12 weeks. Hugs and Good Luck to everyone. Kate",

It has been a slow recovery but I'm glad I made the decision to do both at the same time. I did not want to go through this twice in a very short period of time. I had a large tumor in the ovary that was growing rapidly and then they found I had IDC in my right breast. This was all in the space of a few weeks. Lots of tests and doctors. Because I am diabetic, I've had a few problems with the incisions healing and we are waiting for that so I can start Chemo. I was in the hospital for 4 days and slept in a recliner when I came home. It was not bad. The BM caused me very little pain, the drains they put in were a nuisance, but not painful. I was more uncomfortable with the hyster than the BM. After the hospital stay, I used very little pain meds and was up and around as much as possible. If you have questions just PM me and I will try to answer. I couldn't find too many women who were having a double surgery like mine, but the women on this site were so kind and helpful. Hugs, kate",
