We sat at the local clinic in the smallish town here. I wrote down my symptoms, and also showed the webpage on canadas cancer org to my friend who was going to translate. the Doctor, as it seems so many posts here said would happen, felt for nodules and said she did not find any. Non the less, as it was time (been a while since my last) for a mammogram, she prescribed one, aswell as a scan. She recommended I do it when my menstration is underway,  as my breasts were very sensitive to the touch.  all in all, she prescribed creams for the itchy skin of my breasts, pills to take away inflammation, more pills for what she felt was an abnormally sensitive abdomen. (hurt from pressure). told me to stay away from caffeine and citric products. she said my body presented all the signs of early pregnancy, but when she did a ultra sound, we both saw there was no amniotic sac. I came home and calculated the possible date I could of fallen pregnant...on the 4th of April...and then googled the developement of the amniotic sac...it forms around the 10th day..(despite being sterilized 10 years ago when my tubes were tied). it has all left me feeling confused, and very silly. my husband told his work collegue over dinner, while i was at the clinic, that i had googled my symptoms, and they all laughed at the \"google doctor\" making herself worried. Now I am doubting myself. I am sure that out of the millions of women that catch their breath with worry, to the possibility of being ill (we have such complicated and delicate reproductive systems..), many do not have anything serious. So, here I sit, with a bag of anti-inflammatory pills and creams...and wait for the results of the blood tests taken today.. 6 different tests..I still have to google/translate the meanings of each word when the results come back...not even sure what they are for. my friend says her gyny, the lady i saw, and a very kind woman, runs them annually. So, I guess they are general \"woman\" tests. I was tired today, when I returned after another 4 hours in the lines at the clinic...(the locals are very open people, and pointed how and where, when they saw I did not know which department to go to...to first be billed for the blood tests in one area, then line up to pay in another, then off to the lab in another section of the clinic. to see so many third world people, count their pennies, to have their tiny baby tested, was more a lesson in humility and humanity, making me put my concerns into perspective. so much poverty, and so much gratitude towards the medical staff here. I remember that in the 70's in Africa. when a doctor was revered, and NEVER questioned...) the medical staff work exceptional hours, and the pay does not buy fancy cars.... for that, in this country, one has to be into land ownership or trade. to work in the medical field is still, as it is in the deeper part of Africa, \"do what you can with what you have...\" in material, in money, in staff... (I live far from the huge city on the South Coast, that has the main tourist industry...) so, I will come back, when i go back for my second appointment with the doctor, on the 5th day of my periods...so she can do another ultra sound of my womb. she said it was thick, and she measured it...(I still have that worry about the prolapsing uterus...and the options of surgery, which she said she would only resort to as a final solution..) thank you, those who, despite the tremendous pain, trials, and tribulations...come here, to hold the hands of those of us who are sleepless with the shadows in the dark...the unknown. and I keep you in my prayers. vava ",

      "Content": "vava wrote: Hello, I need somewhere to put my thoughts. Not a diary, alone on a book shelf. I cannot email a friend, and bless him, speak about it for hours to my husband. He said a few minutes ago, when he saw I was reading the forums that \"he believed in positive thinking\", and it did not help me surfing the net... that it would just stress me. (I know about the 5 stages of grief first documented by Elizabeth Kubler Ross. Denial is the easiest one for those around us when we are ill.) I have been angry for two days now. I have not been on the forums or the net searching the topic of cancer for more than 72 hours. but, I have been having the symptoms since last year. I put it down to turning forty, Maybe early menapause, then, down to \"positive thinking\" that if I wished hard enough, I would increase in breast size. (late last year my husband and I had an awful seperation that lasted 3 months. He had a mid life crisis and found a woman half his age with a 36DD breasts. she moved into my house for 2 months, while I was back home with my teenage kids, visiting them in Europe....) it took a terrible toll on my self esteem, and first I lost 15 pounds, and then, when I returned after our reconciliation in late janauary, put on 35 pounds. the intense itching, heat, cup size bigger, and even the white leaking from my nipples, not to mention late last year, orange peel rash that came and went on my breasts....never once made me think of googling the symptoms. Not until friday night, 3 days ago. I have never heard of IBC.(Inflammatory Breast Cancer). I had seen my gyny two months ago, for a early stage prolapsed uterus, and that has been my main worry all this time...she also gave me a course of antibiotics for a vaginal itch...in other words, I was much to preoccupied with eating down my anger (have not emotionally dealt with MissDD, as my friends back home call her) gaining weight, and getting rid of the rash, and worried about my whole uterus falling out. (I worked in a palliative care centre in Europe, as a nurses aide, and some of the much elder patients had prolapsed rectums and uterus) all in all, when i googled the symptoms, because the headaches, dull, but frequent, when i only used to have ONE a month, the day before my menstraul cycle started, and the nausea, lingering, slight, but so much a reminder of my 3 pregnancies. (I was bed ridden for the second two, due to such severe vomiting over many months, i was almost hospitalized with the last one, but had a husband, since divorced, who was on the road alot with his rock and roll band, and no one to care for the other two little ones...so i stayed in bed for 5 months.) I had my tubes tied as soon as my daughter was born, and have been in excellent health all my life. I just dont get ill... if i have a symptom, I know there is a reason. Headaches due to hormonal changes, excetra. I was a massage therapist for many years, and \"listened\" to  my clients bodies for the 2 and half hour tip to toe massage their  received. I always said to them. If you feel a change, if your body says something, listen to it... stess, in small doses is instinctively healthy, it pumps adrenalin, to get one AWAY from the stress causer....but chronic stress depletes the body, and  changes the chemistry, and triggers layer upon layer of other symptoms and problems in the body, like a domino hitting over another and another. this is what i told them. I used to meditate, keep my stress levels moderated... until a few years ago.  A long term relationship came to an end, I found myself without an income, without a home, and luckily moonlighting massages in a friends empty summer home kept me going...but it depleted me. long story short, i met someone on a chat site, a canadian, and we immediatly hit it off. we spoke on the phone (I was in Europe, he in the Carrabian.) before I could count to three, i had immigrated to a land of sunshine and laughter....and things improved for me...till late last year, when he had his crisis.... I had a severe breakdown...and instead of crying, i became so angry, I could feel it poison me. I stayed for 3 months in a friends spare bedroom, and ranted and raved about my lamentable marraige....that is when the symptoms started...I would scratch my breasts all the time...they itched so much. I even jokingly said it was because they (my breasts) were jealous they were a 38A cup instead of a 36DD.... my long term friends fled from my palpable anger, and except for my landlady/friend, saw nobody. (my husband, despite his filandering, sent me alot of money to pay my way/stay) I left the cold of Europe to return and work on  my (3rd) marraige, and tried to turn the page...but my eating disorder took the advantage, and when i googled on friday night, and read that weight increase could change the relationship with estrogen...(I still have not grasped fully how estrogen and cancer are linked) and that it might be the cause of my nausea.... Never did i think I would find a disease i had never heard of! My grandmother, bless her, fought cancer for years....skin grafts on her fair read haired skin, and awful treatments...I was in my teens at the time. I lived in Africa, and she had to travel 1 000 kms to come to stay with us during her radiology. She was deeply devout and never complained. In retrospect, i am shocked at my own lack of understanding about what she was experiencing. when my god mother had cancer, I was in my early 20's, and once again, she did not discuss it openly. so much secrecy seemed to be around the C word. (as they called it back in Africa...the \"big C\"... ) so, here I am, having fought with my husband last night, over a petty detail. He casually asked when i planned to get my next bikini wax, and I flew into him...how could be so petty, when I was really faced with bigger worries. He followed me to the kitchen, confused. I had been on the forum, trying to scan as much information on breast reconstruction...knowing he is a breast man, and i not only dont have any...well, until the last two months, and i had to buy a new bra last week! but what if what i had, was disfigured? Today, he asked his secretary to find me a doctor that could treat this inflammation. (the \"bug bite\" came back, on the outer left breast, and i had not associated the heat and lack of strength in the upper left arm to my breast symptoms, until i read on a forum that a \"bug bite\" is also a symptom of IBC.) By the end of our conversation last night, when i saw that he was not at all concerned, (who can believe that a person they love is ill, when there are not severe symptoms..)and so I ENDED UP MINIMIZING it, saying...\"oh, it is proberly mastitis...our sex life is catching up with us, and maybe the stimulation caused the ducts to kick start....\" (I had read a small article on that on saturday.) I breast fed 3 children, all in total, for 5 years. I followed the African tradition, despite being of European descent, and fully breastfed the last two, until the age of 2. that meant, even at night.) I know my breasts very very well. I know the slightest tinge, the slightest swelling and sensation. I I even carried my tiny babies until toddler age in Asian slings, or on my back, to be in syncronicity with their bodily functions. that is why, now that I have finally taken my focus of my uterian issues, i have woken up, so to speak, to breasts that are not mine. symptoms last year:Intense itching, orange peel \"zones\", nipples dripping white \"milk\" when pinched. symptoms these last 3 months: extremely sensitive breasts, having to wear bras all the time to relieve the discomfort of them moving freely(as a previous Acup, I only used to put on bras for sports), increased in size. heat/hot to touch(rest of body skin cool). bug bites.(in retrospect, I cannot pinpoint if i had any before the present one...) scratching my breasts alot (to the point, where i was aware of it being a social handicap...people would stare) shooting pain if I bump them, or my little dog jumps on me when i am lying down.. lingering nausea when i wake up.. and, interestingly, the last 6 weeks or so....a craving for fresh fruit juices and fruit...to the point I will drive all the way to the supermarket just for a bag of oranges...! (I also have increased my caffeine consumption greatly...from avoiding it totally most of my life..) so, I realised how the \"google\" can make a person nervous....to read that caffeine, and weight gain can trigger those with a gene (I still have to understand the estrogen gene ) I could not tolerate the contraceptive pill after my second child...vomited. that is when i knew i had a problem with a the female hormones...but i never looked further into the subject. I  just had to use  alternative forms of contraception...mechanical forms. all in all, my relationship to my breasts has been a positive one over the years. Only the last 6 months, with the whole MissDD and then my uterus prolapsing, with what I feel (with my finger) as a hernia from my rectum... I have not had a negative relationship with my female organs. I feel almost betrayed by my body. I ended up, late last night, googling metaphysical reasons for cancer and reproductive organs. But, no matter what I read there, it did not change the reality, the fact that I am right now facing two issues. I dare not talk to my friends back in France. They did not approve of my husband's actions, and as most of them are \"esoteric\" in their views on life, the last thing I need if them to say. \"meditate, and say affirmations, it will make it all go away.\". If my body has arrived at this point, if my symptoms are what they are, the time has come to face them.  The road that i traveled over the last 6  months has been filled with strong emotions (kept inside, and kept back from others) and, even with the first wake up call visit to the gyny for the utereus (I did not go to the follow up tests, our good friend died that same week, my dog ate rat poison aswell, and had to have daily trips to the vet, and then, we went to Miami for passover...somehow, I let it all slip to the back of my agenda.) my husband and his secretary have been pestering me to go for my followups, and i just made excuses.... now, i am going late this afternoon, to see the gyny again. (she is spanish speaking, and my husbands secretary says she will come along...normally she does the translating over the phone.) i have made a word document, with the translation of all my symptoms, but frankly ladies, after reading so many posts on the forums about misdiagnosis, and it being brushed off as \"insect bites\"...I am not holding my breath. I know that she will (more than likely) prescribe antibiotics for this \"bug bite\". we live on a Tropical island, and the tourists are eaten alive by mosquitos. but my body has climatized to them...and like the locals, i am seldom if ever bothered by mosquitos now. Luckily my husband is a very C.O.D man. (compulsive obsessive disorder) and when he gets an idea, then, short of seeing the presidents personal surgeon, he will not stop till every symptom is explained and fixed. I feel so much better emotionally today.(relieved of the worry, that I have been carrying subconsciously for months now, and this weekend, as a possible illness i did not know existed!)  he is also methodical. I tend to be either very naive and happy, or despondant about an outcome. He moves mountains. i joked last night when i said...why did you build a new hospital on the North Coast that does not have an english speaking gyncologist and oncologist?? (he is on the board of the latest hospital, with an emergency and two floors....small, but state of the art equipement, for medical emergencies for the retired ex-pats from the USA and Canada, aswelll as the tourists that flock the island.) The doctors speak english...and we know how it is to be able to understand,and express ourselves. I moved from Africa to Europe with two tiny babies many years ago...and had to learn my fourth language to be understood. Now I have moved again, and Spanish will be the fifth language under my belt. But, I do not use words like cancer in my daily chit chat with others...i had to google the translation for my symptoms. So, the end of my ramblings. this is not a question and answer ramblings. just a \"I have to share this, but who with?\" worry. I dare not tell my mother or her best friend, my god mother, about my worries. they are back in Africa, and the last thing they need is to the \"Big C\" word come out of my mouth. Until, and UNLESS i have a diagnosis, I will never mention it to them... my friends back in Europe, well, as I said, they have their own lives, and the two best friends that I have in Canada, (cyber friends) will be the first i talk to once I see the gyny tonight. but from what I have read on this forum....it is hard on those in our lives, either to understand a worry, when all that we can justify for it is \"my breasts are so darn itchy, and yes, all you can see is a mosquito bite, and that they are bigger..!\" I hope my story will be just a \"silly worry\". that when I come back here, as the weeks go by, and i can say, \"hey, my symptoms are gone. the headaches and nausea have subsided now that I am eating properly, and lost those extra pounds.\" (i am only 10 pounds into \"obese\" on my body index...i worked it out last night. I have been this  heavy after each pregnancy, yet never had my breasts doing this...as I was breast feeding at the time..) thank you....even if this ramble is not read, the mere fact that i could put it down somewhere. put it into words...instead of it going around and around in my head, like it has been doing all weekend..is a relief. bye bye for now.
