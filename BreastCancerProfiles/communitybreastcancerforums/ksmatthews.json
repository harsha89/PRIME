But my bone mets are gone and almost all the lung spots are gone! I have not done any treatments since Feb. but I will be starting cisplatin in Aug. to try to fight off the rest of the lung mets.

I have been using a flat iron on  the tops and sides and leaving the back curly.  Now my hair is damaged. I went for a trim last week, but she would have had to cut it really short to get all the damage gone.  So be careful with the flat iron.  Also my chemo curls are in the back only and she tried using several products to flat iron it out and it wasn't happening lol!

I just wish it would grow a couple of more inches so I can do something with it, I love it short though and dont know if I will grow it long again.

I wear a bandana and I prefer it anyday.  I like your scarf though, looks great on you.",
