After my first chemo Tx and Neulasta shot my arm got tight, hurt and became discolored when I pulled or pushed something.Also the veins on that shoulder became more visible. When I told the surgeon, he didn't believe me. I insisted and a doppler ultrasound confirmed clots around the catheter. It is working well, I have to be on bloodthinners though and it took almost 6 weeks for the protime test to be in a therapeutic range. The arm still changes colors with certain activities but doesn't hurt anymore.",

The drain stayed in for 2 weeks.Towards the end I had to change dressings twice a day because the fluid wasn't draining in the drain bulb anymore. I had no problems with seroma build-up. i faithfully started walking my fingers up the wall to improve mobility. Finding a comfortable sleeping position wasn't easy, use plenty of pillows. Also after a few days I put a sports bra on because the slight pressure gave support. Plan to wear tops with buttons and get help with dressing, bathing. Baby powder around the dressing helped minimize odor until I could wash the area. A lot of people report burning and numbness under the armpit and outer upper arm. It has to do with the intercosto-brachial nerve being cut to have better access to nodes. It will take time to get used to this feeling. It may improve and it may be permanent. It does not affect mobility, just something to learn to live with. Â I hope this helps. Good luck!",
