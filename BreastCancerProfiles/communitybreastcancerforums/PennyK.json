She ran through options with me before surgery but they depended on whether pathology matched the biopsy and MRI results. I can\u2019t remember the 2 chemo drugs she said I would get if the results didn\u2019t increase my stage. I had clean margins, the tumors were free-floating and hadn\u2019t grown. Sentinel lymph nodes were clear I\u2019ll know next week what the chemo drugs are. I will have an anti-HER2 injection once a month for a year. Chemo will be once a week for 12 weeks. Hormone therapy for 5-10 years. The surgeon placed a port during my surgery.",

Worse than the money is the pain of the cap when it first cools down and the extra time in the chair.",
