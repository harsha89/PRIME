I find myself obsessing about every little thing and worrying a lot. Maybe just a stress hangover? Well, thanks to everyone for the support before my surgery. I am glad it is over.

The general consensus was that if I did not have a fever and wasn't coughing up green stuff then the surgery would go on as planned. It did go as scheduled and I actually had a sinus infection when they did it. No problems. Every doctor is different but I bet you'll make it. Colds peak at day 3 or 4. That gives you plenty of time to get better. Feel good and get some rest.",
