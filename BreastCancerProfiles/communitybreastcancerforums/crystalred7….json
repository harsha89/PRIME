When I called the doctor to set up my appointment the nurse said \"based on your MRI results from last year he wants a bilateral mammo and US just in case.\" I hate all the waiting, waiting for test to be done waiting for results....waiting waiting waiting..... I still have the lump as it is bigger and more distinguishable. I have put this lump in the back of my mind but after getting my reminder to set up my appointment it starts to stress me out. From what I remember the MRI basically said that my breast were extremely dense and they said it could not really see anything. The biopsy that was done was a little difficult and he said he was \"pretty sure\" he got the right spot biopsied and it did not come back as anything specific. Breast Cancer Awareness month really gets my mind thinking. I am just venting. Thank you all who take the time to read this. Many hugs to all the ladies in waiting.

Finally had a biopsy on Wednesday and I have to wait for the results.  I was just wondering how you all found your BC.  I can tell you that you women are my new hero's, you are strong even when it's bad and I hope that i have the courage you have if mine comes back cancer.  As I can't even say that word out loud it makes me cry like a big baby. Hugs and prayers to all of yall.",
