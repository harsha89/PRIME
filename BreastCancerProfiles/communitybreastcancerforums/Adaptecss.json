You had an experience where the 'lack' of breast had to be in the forefront, so no wonder you felt temporarily defined by your 'lack'. It's always missing, just not always ruling the situational response. Others don't really get it, they are curious and then can say something supportive (or not) and then look away. It's a deep scar, and very much a real challenge to feeling like your old self",
