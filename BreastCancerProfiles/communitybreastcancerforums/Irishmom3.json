I wasn't able to have my treatment today and was so disappointed since I have only 2 left. I have noticed loss of hearing since my second dose of Taxol so my MO was very hesitant to give me another dose until I have a hearing test and evaluation by an ENT. They gave me a tuning fork test and failed it in the sense that I definitely have loss of hearing in 1 ear more than the other. My MO said pending the results of my ENT appointment I may have to forgo the last 2 treatments. Has anyone experienced this? Thoughts / suggestions? I have come this far I just want to finish but don't want permanent hearing loss either. My MO said since I got through the A/C which was the most important part of my treatment the Taxol is really just a bonus since I still am having rads and hormone treatment. Just confused and frustrated. Trying not to jump the gun, but it's hard not to",

My pain from my mastectomy was easier compared to this pain. I'm hoping my MO has something to offer. I've been getting Neulasta all along and never had this problem while on A/C. I'm just disappointed since my MO told me I would tolerate the Taxol better than the A/C. I'm starting to feel down and out, midway treatment exhaustion as my MO puts it.

I'm so disappointed I'm so close to being done. Now I have to regroup after he presents me to tumor board. Trying to decide to forgo the last treatment or change meds and give me 2 more treatments, or just start my rads. I wish I had a crystal ball to help with these difficult decisions. Stay mom- I'm also doing rads with expanders. My plastic surgeon feels he gets better results with the final implants when he keeps the expanders in during rads and waits 9-12 months for final implant. He tells my he doesn't have as good results when he does the final implant before the rads such rejection as well as the contour and they often are not symmetrical. Hope this helps.
