LOL!!  So, I guess I learned my lesson--I have to go much slower with my activity!  So happy the cancer is GONE!!!  I knew it would be after having bmx, but it was so nice to hear!!  I finally had a breakdown--hadnt had one yet!!  I sobbed for about 15 minutes (with relief).  Boy did that hurt to cry that hard!!  My chest really hurt!! Ive been going back and forth with my foobs.  One day I hate them, the next I think they arent that bad--today I think they are gross and look so mutilated!!  But, I have expanders, and they will be changing size and shape so much over the coming months, I need to stop examining them.   I LOVE my Softee Two!  I bought 2 of them before surgery and have been wearing one everyday since the surgery.  My Dr doesnt use the after surgery bra's that I hear are very tight and can be uncomfortable.  I like having the Softee on though--so soft and comfortable!  I figure I will get a lot of use since I wont be buying a bra for so long.  I will at least have this to wear under my shirts.  I guess thats all for now.  Im glad to see that others are doing well after their surgery too. --Kendra-- ",
