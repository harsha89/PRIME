Did my biopsy this past Friday and I have to tell you that if it is cancer I am facing, I am confident that everything will be okay. I think I get the feeling that it's cancer just from the sad look on the doctor's face in the breast clinic. They asked me 3 times within five minutes if I have a family history of cancer or breast cancer, the nurse noted the dimpling just above the lump as I leaned forward. The doctor scheduled an immediate emergency biobsy that this past Thursday and I had an appointment for the next day. Then the radiologist gave me this \"you poor thing\" look just before performing the biopsy. One can't help but take all of these things as a sign that I am about to face a challenge unlike anything I have faced before. I am hopeful and optimistic.  Oh, and the fine needle aspiration of my lymph nodes was outrageously painful! I can compare it to waxing coarse hair, and it was worse than that, lol. Try to find ways to laugh at things...I told my boyfriend I hope they won't have to remove my breast. Then I said too bad I'm not that chick from Total Recall with the 3 breasts because then I could still have 2 left. It was funny to me (hope it doesn't offend anyone). He laughed. The point is, try to find humor where you can. Allow yourself to laugh once in a blue. The serious nature of cancer and procedures and treatments...oh, the waiting! You must hold on to hope and inner peace to maintain your sanity though it all. I have yet to tell my son, who just turned 18 this past January, he's a very sensitive kid. He is the air that I breathe and I know that I am his world. I have to get confirmation of a diagnosis and have details and information to guide him through this.  I am the caregiver in my family, always have been. I take care of everyone. My mother was diagnosed with leukemia in 1992 and died in 1994. I cared for her when she was home, donated blood platelets, took care of my sister. When she died, I raised my sister cared for my ailing maternal grandmother and raised my own child. I returned to college 2 years ago and am 1 week from getting my AAS degree. I put college off because everything was too much for me when my mom was sick. I am finally free of caring for others and now I may need others to care for me. Even if I get a clean bill of health, this process of fearing the unknown in overwhelming.  For me, I plan for the worst and get diappointed by the best. I have already searched for free hospital gown patterns, I hate those things in the hospital. I have also checked out some wigs for just in case. I am taking control where I can and keeping busy at the same time. I talk to my boyfriend about the potential treatment plans and  we are working on a list of questions to ask the doctor in the case that she confirms that it is cancer.  So, I wish you the best and have to get back to my term paper that's due tomorrow.  Shawn",
