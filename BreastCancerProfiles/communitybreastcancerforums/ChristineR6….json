My tumor grew to 9.5X11 centimeters and I had a mammo and an US...the doctors told me that it was probably just scar tissue since I had breast implants and nothing was showing on the Mammogram!!  So you can believe that when it came time for the scans that I was fearing the worst..that it was all over my body..but..it wasn't.  I did a lot of praying...in fact, I think I've been closer to God in the past 3 mos than I've been in my life.   Hang in there!!! Ktlb04:  I have had the EXACT same situation with my left rib side...my surgical oncologist said it's nothing to worry about and it's muscalatory.  Who knows..the scans showed nothing.  I have sugery and a node biopsy in September so we'll see if it's in my nodes at all.",

I'm doing a 2nd round of chemo (carboplatinum, gemzar and herceptin) after 8/9 lymph nodes still showed cancer to the visible eye when I had my mastectomy. Seems the cancer flipped or orig pathology report didint show Her2+...would you believe?!?! Argh...but I'm doing well and each day gets a little easier. The initial diagnosis and shock back in April of this year was the worst. Hang in there ladies....just keep swimming, swimming, swimming :)",
