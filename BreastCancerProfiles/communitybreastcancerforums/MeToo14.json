On Saturday I work as a mail carrier which is very physical. I did take some time off that job because I couldn't lift anything after surgery. Working and driving and going about your normal activities is very doable. But everyone is different and there is no way to really predict how you will react. Most people are ok but it depends on your type of treatment and luck I guess. But to answer your question, yes it is possible.
