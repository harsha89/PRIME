    "Content": "RainbowRibbon9 wrote: I'm 54 and had a breast reduction 9 months ago. My 42DD breasts were transformed to 36C, and I've been enjoying the freedom of my new youthful figure. I asked the surgeon how to do a self-exam afterwards because both breasts were really lumpy. He reassured me, saying it was all scar tissue, so I didn't worry. Whenever I felt them, they were always lumpy, and I kind of slacked off with the self-exams. Then last month I noticed a difference between the two. The right breast had a thickened area that was quite hard. I went to the doctor right away, and she ordered a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound, writing ASAP on the requisition form. The earliest I could get an \"urgent\" appointment was 26 days later.                                       In the past 2 weeks, I have been through a tremendous amount of stress with my mother being hospitalized and almost dying, and she is now in a geriatric hospital. My anxiety level has spiked and I'm afraid the stress hormones may be harmful. I wish I could be calm, but I'm kind of obsessing about it. ...really, it doesn't look good. That lump seems too big and solid to be scar tissue, and this past week I've noticed the lymph nodes on that side are swollen and palpable, and it kind of aches. I feel really queasy and shaky. My partner keeps telling me to think positively and that everything will be all right as if by saying that he'll make it true. I hope he's right; this couldn't happen to me so soon after the surgery; so soon after all I've been through with my mother. But it could, it could hapen to anyone. Is it fate? Not knowing is so scary.         Any words of support will be welcome. Log in to post a reply",
