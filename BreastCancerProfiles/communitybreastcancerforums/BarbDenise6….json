I don't have any symptoms though apart from the sternum . I don't feel sick and I am getting all my normal activities done. What really upset me though is she said there were only a couple more treatments . I have only had docetaxol and xeloda . Surely there are more than 2 more ? I am so upset I feel like finishing myself off. Help barbara",

I had a very bad week last week when I was kept in hospital with a temperature of 39.8 and my blood pressure suddenly dropped very low but have been better this week. Just as well with the kids half term! In fact I just got back from driving to Cornwall and back which is about 450 miles from where I live.Nice to get away with the kids for a few days ! My worry at the moment is weight loss. Barbar",

I have just had pleural effusion removed which went well and was feeling ok until the oncology nurse came along and was supposed to be talking to me about my new chemo Eribulin. Instead of that she started talking about what do you want to do if this drug doesn't work and we can't give you any more? I felt dreadful. These are the drugs I have had: docetaxol, xeloda, paclitaxel and soon to start Eribulin. Surely there are others aren't there. I don't feel ready to die yet. Barb",

I agree there were several chemos I hadn't had but if the liver has deteriorated below the level they are allowed to give chemo that will be the same whichever oncologist I see. I do feel bad with lots of breathlessness and pain in right side. Depressing . I keep hoping the liver can recover enough but I think that's a remote chance. Bar",
