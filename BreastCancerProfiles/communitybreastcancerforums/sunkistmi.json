What is the sleeve that several of you have spoken of?  Is it like the tight stockings that can be worn to reduce swelling in the legs?  I just wondered because I will be going back to Alaska next summer and want to make sure I have no problems w/swelling.  Thank you in advance for any help.

I was dx with DCIS in 2/06 thru a needle biopsy.  The BS did a lumpectomy and the surgeons took a pretty large chunk of my breast, basically from 9 to noon.  3 of the 4 margins did not come back clean.  The BS said that I would probably not be happy with the look of the breast after further surgery and then radiation.  I most likely would have had to have recon to make it look normal.  I opted to have a mast w/immediate SIEA recon.  For me, it was the best choice.  I was dx w/DCIS in the other breast in May and will be having mast w/immediate TUG recon on Aug. 4. Good luck.  If you would like to talk more, please send me a Private Message and I will be happy to help you however I can.  God bless. Wendy",

Be sure to remove the patch if you are going into a hot tub or sauna because the heat will cause the body to absorb it faster.  You can use adhesive or paper tape to put it back on.  I have such horrible hot flashes that I'm always taping mine back on.  I make really sure I hold my palm over it when I put it on for at least 1 min. even tho it calls for 30 sec.  Also, I found the generic brand much smaller than the brand name.  For me that is important because it can tend to cause itching since I'm allergic to adhesives.  Also, if you have any problems with morphine, you may have a problem with fentenyl since they are in the same family. Good luck with it and don't worry about all the warnings.They have to tell you everything under the sun because of lawsuits but in reality I have felt they were quite safe.  I still use pain pills for breakthrough pain at times.  All the best in your journey.

The treatment of the cancer is what causes the problems for the other organs.  I have not experienced this myself since I have DCIS.  I had a mastectomy of the right breast in 2006 and will be having the left breast removed August 4.  My mother had invasive breast cancer and had both radiation and chemo.  Both are very hard on the body, although the chemo is the worst.  Basically it is used to kill all the cancer cells but it kills good cell too.  There can be hair loss, severe vomiting, body pain, fatigue and just general rotten feeling.  Radiation can cause burns, skin changes, fatigue and in some cases if done of the left side, problems down the road with the heart and lung.  If you go to the Treatment thread and ask this question, perhaps you would get some personal stories you could use for your class. One of the other things that affects the body due to the breast cancer, but not the cancer itself, is the reconstruction phase after a mastectomy.  It used to be there were only a couple of procedures, the TRAM flap using a persons own tissue or a implant.  However, new ways of using own tissue are becoming used more often due to easier recovery and less pain.  My first reconstruction used the fat from my stomach, called SIEA.  This next surgery will use the fat from the inner thigh at the top of my leg, a TUG flap.  They can also use the fat on your butt, GAP flap.  If you go to www.diepflap.com, they describe the different types of surgery in detail. I hope this has helped.  I would be happy to talk with you more if needed.  Contact me on the Private Message forum and I will be happy to get back with you.  Good luck on your paper.  I hope you get an A.

You are such an inspiration and blessing to so many.  I don't know you and have only been on the boards for a month or so but have found such strength and hope in the sisters that have posted.  You are in so many hearts, including mine. I pray that the pain will get better every day and that the lp will reveal nothing serious.  I struggle with tests sometimes, hoping they show nothing yet hoping they show what is so very wrong.  It's almost worse when they come back \"OK\" but you KNOW in your heart that there is something very, very wrong.  Been thru that several times.  In fact with my thyroid cancer in 1974, three radioactive scans showed absolutely nothing wrong.  The only reason my doc was concerned was because I could start to see a small bump showing and getting larger.  He had never said there was such a thing a thyroid cancer.  Needless to say, it was quite a shock when he came out of the OR and told my family.  It was even more strange since I was only 22.  Usually the variety I had was found only in those older.  The cancer doc walked in my room (my mom was visiting) and stood in front of me; then informed me that \"you have thyroid cancer.  We will not be doing any radiation or chemo but will be doing full-body bone scans on you for the next 10 years because it could grow back in your spleen, liver, stomach or bones.\"  He then turned and walked out.  Here I was, 22 years old and had just gotten married in September (this was June).  I didn't have words to say.  I remember thinking \"why me Lord\", and that is when I received a hug from God.  I was \"enfolded\" by Someone so wonderous and heard a voice say \"All will be well my child\".  I immediately stopped crying and my mother asked me what happened, she said I looked liked I was filled w/light.  I was. I share this because right now I pray that you will be enfolded as I was, to feel God's arms around you because I know you already know you are so very loved.  You are such an inspiration and blessing and have sent out so many prayers to others that it is only right that they come back to you.  May you have a restful evening and a good and peaceful night's sleep. Today, one of my prayers were answered in that I think my mast w/TUG recon looks like it will be scheduled the first week of Aug.  Now I just need to pray for knowledge of peace with the selection of the surgeon.  She was trained by the surgeon that did my SIEA on the rt. breast but I will be her first one alone and here in MI.  Does that make her any less capable?  I don't think so but am second-guessing my decision.  She is in-network and participates w/my insurance and the other surgeon didn't.  We are still paying off the surgery from 2 years ago!  I can't put my family thru that expense again, I felt guilty about it the first time.  I just need to keep praying and asking for peace regarding my decision and for skill for the dr.  She has been doing PS for 15 years and does the other 'normal' forms of breast recon as well as the DIEP/SIEA and TUG recon so I should/will be in good hands. May God bless you and keep you.  May His face shine upon you and His love enfold you and may you rest in Him.  Good night dear sister. Also in His hands, Sunkist in MI",
