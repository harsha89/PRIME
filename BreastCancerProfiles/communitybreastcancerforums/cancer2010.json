I cannot remember where I saw some literature on only 4 cycles being as effective. Is there anyone who has only had the 4 cycle regimen of these 2 chemo agents versus the standard 6 cycles. My onco said she would understand my election to do only 4 cycles but she would prefer the standard 6 cycles. She is a physician that would strongly disagree with you if she really felt something was not appropriate but she did not flinch when I agreed for only the 4 (actually very amenable!!!). Thanks for anyones help on this out there. Lacy",

I realize it was in 2009 and that is way too early to determine anything. What was your oncologist's rationale (or the study) in regards to this. Thanks tons, Lacy",
