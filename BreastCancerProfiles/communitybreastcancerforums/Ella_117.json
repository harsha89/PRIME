I had 16 chemos ....first AC dose dense every 2 weeks, followed by weekly Taxol and Herceptin. Towards the end of my treatment my onc cut the steroid dose in half and as a result it really helped alleviate the insomnia issues. Fortunately, once treatments are over the insomnia does goes away. I did not start losing my hair until the 21st day and even then, I had quite a bit of hair left that hung on, and looked good sticking out under hats. Finally a month later, i did lose most, but soon after my hair surprisingly started to grow back during my 12 weekly taxol treatment. It was such a welcomed surprise that I had never expected! As for hair suggestions....after purchasing a number of expensive wigs than had what I know now to be really fake looking hairlines... Another woman on these boards turned me on to a great wig company called Estetica Designs, which offers a complete line of wigs called the naturalle collection that feature absolutely amazing styles!! You can actually pull your hair back and you cannot tell that it is not your real hairline coming out of your scalp!!! The new wig technology is amazing and even fun......Some of the wig names are Monica, Blake, sienna, and many more .....,that can be ordered online at a reasonable price about $150 and under range with many colors to choose from. You can check out their website by typing in estetica design wigs. Good luck, and i hope you begin to feel better each day.",

I had a similar experience....after my first biopsy came back positive the surgeon ordered an MRI and 2 additional spots lit up. I had to then have 2 more biopsies...it was so stressful and painful...but both spots turned out to be false positives. The one spot couldn't even be picked up on ultrasound, but since it lit up on MRI the surgeon was obligated to then determine the nature of the tumor with needle biopsy. The doctor told me that he really hesitates to order MRIs because they have a very high false positive rate. I hope yours turn out to also be false positives. In the end I was glad to have had the MRI because I have very dense breasts and it provided a baseline for future imaging. {{Hugs}}",

It was your kind info sharing of the specific Monika wig that got me thru some of the most difficult days. I can't tell you just how many compliments I received wearing this wig...and it was so realistic and affordable. I think I may even like it better than my real hair...LOL! MizMarie...I am still using your suggestion of Garnier HerbaShine Haircolor. It worked great......effectively coloring my fragile chemo hair from the start. I am sad because I think they are actually discontinuing it! And of course LAGO.....it was your linky of the hair growth progression that gave me inspiration from the very start of this journey! Thank you all and if I can figure out how to post a photo...... I will try to post a 1 yr PFC photo.",

I am now 10 weeks PFC ( i finished mid-March) and everything has finally filled in. I have about an 1\" to 1 3/4 of hair....it is slightly longer in the back. And...all of the eyelashes and most of the eyebrows are back. It seems that many people experience hair growth while on the weekly Taxol treatments, but the hair grows back much quicker once the treatments stop.",
