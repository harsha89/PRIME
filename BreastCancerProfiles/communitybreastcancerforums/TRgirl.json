Thought all went well, was mentally ready for radiation and to get to the next step.  Pathology then came back w/ only one clear margin the rest was DCIS. Since area so large 5cm, Dr. recommends mastectomy, no radiation now.  I've decided that a mastectomy is the best thing since I now know I have the DCIS also. Opting for reconstruction - met w/ plastic surgeon this week. Meet w/ onc. 10/23 & surgeon again 10/26.  I dread the next surgery, afraid they'll be another surprise. I'm 39 w/ extensive cancer on mom's side (4 great aunts w/ breast cx, mom-colon cx - total of 13 cx's her side). Also afraid to be gene tested even though Mom is currently being tested for non BRCA related cancers. I'm probably still in denial hoping this is a fluke.  They said they'd watch me every 6 mo. for 5 yrs. Not sure if I should consider a double mastectomy. Anxious also since mammogram didn't see tumor, U/S did. Haven't told mom yet - plan on telling her in next week or so. She's not been doing well - met. colon cx. I think I dread telling her more than the cx itself since I was lucky enough to find it early. Just nervous about next step now. Reading these posts does help me a lot knowing there are other confused souls out there. ",

At first I was put off by loosing my nipple too but after seeing reconstructed ones, that put my mind at ease. I had an MRI on the other breast prior to my initial surgery and all was clear. I still have to get a copy of that report though. I met w/ a new ob-gyn today and she was wonderful! My other Dr. (had for 20+ yrs) dismissed the lump - said it was a cyst and to wait til next year to see if it had changed!!! I talked w/ this new Dr. at length and she was extremely supportive. After much thought and discussions w/ my husband, surgeon, plastic surgeon, my mom's onc and the new OB-Gyn, I decided the most important step is to get rid of any lingering cancer -so mastectomy for sure. As far as the gene testing goes, the outcome wouldn't change my surveillance but only add to any worries. Even if not BRCA, I could have other cancer related genes based on family history. If my mom comes back positive for some wacky gene, I'll just take note and watch for any possible related problems. Bottom line is I have to be diligent along w/ my doctors in monitoring my health which I plan on doing. Had I not been my own advocate, I am convinced I would have been looking at a completely different scenario concerning my cancer. I have no children and one older brother. I feel so much better today in terms of my mental disposition. The new doctors I have seem so supportive and I really believe that w/ their help I can get through this. Now I'm just anxious to set a surgery date. I know that will bring up a new host of fears but I think I'm over the initial \"second\" shock of having to have a mastectomy. Thank you again, it's nice to know someone is listening/reading who cares.  I've discovered typing my thoughts out also helps me. I'm glad I found this site.  ",
