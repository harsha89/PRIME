I'd like to avoid radiation what with info I've heard regarding cardiac implications with it.  My father was dead a year younger than I am now from massive coronary.  Dx was 11/27/13, I think onc. & surgeon plan is for lumpectomy, but tumor was large and I'm trip. neg., so I am leaning more toward mastectomy, maybe bilateral?  Would I still need radiation?",

Forgot to mention, 5 nodes removed on sentinel biop, none positive.  Don't know the Stage due to rather large tumor size and gr. III/IIII.",
