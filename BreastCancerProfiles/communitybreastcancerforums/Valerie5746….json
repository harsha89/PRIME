Ask questions and I believe there are a few more days to enroll. My Onc doesn't think they can deny it. Soooooo........ I'm staying where I am cuz it works but it's all expensive...I think they will pay. Good luck! ",

After four years of NED , it's quite a shock to have to Tavel further down the road. It's scary and it takes time to take it in. Each time I face my own mortality in a deeper way, it's weeks to months before I can understand, incorporate and accept what's happening and again what has happened. Anyway, I get the feeling you will ask questions when u r readyðŸ’œgood luck!",

I asked the insurance question and he said he can't imagine how insurance company's could get out of it. Not that that hasn't been a common problem! Great news, I hope!  Got great news myself. My TMs are still plummeting and I am at 51. 30 is normal. In any way, I have never been so close to normal in my life!! Looking up for us ladies!!!",
