There are those who are not going to be \"survivors\", but who are vital, amazing, courageous, amazing , did I say AMAZING?) human be...ings. They are here with us now, treasured by all who encounter them. They endure treatments that are painful, often humiliating, and a lot of the time experimental (or hopeful?). They try to sleep at night, even though they are fighting nausea from the food they've carefully chosen. They try to find a position that will allow them to rest, despite the fractures in their skeleton. They hope that their minds can rest, despite the fears they have about their families and loved ones, who will one day have to live in a future that doesn't include them. They get up each morning, aching; waiting to try to get out of bed until they have taken the medicine that eases their pain--the medicine that some people have made difficult for them to get, because they use it recreationally. Unlike Amy, whose firm has supported her emotionally, financially, and socially, many Stage 4 Plus sufferers have no health insurance, financial support, or accessibility to state-of-the-art treatments. They fight an even more difficult fight. All of these fighters, as I will call them, are struggling to live their weird new lives, not because they are \"special\", or \"chosen\", or brave, or strong. They are my child, or your child. They just want to have a little fun, a little love..., a little taste of life in their time. I wish that we could direct some attention to them. I guess the term \"survivors\" sounds more inspirational, but these \"fighters\" amaze me. October is a very \"pink\" month, but there is a day set aside to recognize and support those who are suffering from metastatic breast cancer. It is October 13th. Please think of Amy, and those like her, and educate others about the lack of funding, research, and early detection of breast cancer for young people. YOUNG people. There is progress being made against breast cancer in 40ish people. Meanwhile, young ones are being diagnosed at end stage. And their siblings are having to fight with the insurance companies, who dictate the treatments that are worthy of coverage. There needs to be change, for my girls, and for yours, and for children of other mothers whom I don't want to feel our pain.
