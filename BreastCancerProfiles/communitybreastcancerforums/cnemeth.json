Can't decide if I want to bother with hair color anymore.  Will have to wait and see what I end up with. Does Tamoxifen affect your hair?!?",

Got about once a month to my favorite therapist (yes, she is $80/hour too) but monthly seems right for me.  It keeps me aware and the problem under control ~~ well so far anyway.  You never know with the LE.

      "Content": "cnemeth wrote: My fingernails went crazy this last week, about a month after my last chemo (4 rounds T/C).  All during chemo they were incredibly healthy and strong.  Now they are still strong but appear to be lifting off of my nail bed.  The moons have turned into two white lines.  Very creepy looking. Has this happened to anyone??  Are they going to fall off??  It isn't like I can do anything about it but am wondering what will happen next. Definitely an interesting journey so far.  Preparing for double mast on 6/17 (right side lumpectomy and re-excision in December, still has bad margin) and trying to not worry about anything that I can't do something about.  Just discovered this site on Monday and marvel at the strength and compassion of so many fabulous women!!!

Fortunately (I guess you can call it that) my husband's oncologist (we had been seeing him for 5 years to deal with my husband's lymphoma) is the first person I had my primary care dr refer me to.  He said I was pulling the cart before the horse but agreed to the referral.  The oncologist who I trusted implicitly explained everything to me from start to finish and was involved with my surgeons decisions and plan of treatment.  There are surgeons out there with compassion (male and female) so find the right one. It is all about trusting your doctors (trust and verify) so you must find someone you trust. Colleen",
