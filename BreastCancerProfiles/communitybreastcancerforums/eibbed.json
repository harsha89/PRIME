No one mention option of masectomy Just lumpectomy and radiation. . May I ask why are you getting a mascetomy. I am trying to understand all of this. Does adh mean you would eventually get an invasive and you want to prevent it? How big of any area was your adh? Thanks for helping me understand. Debbie",
