I'm only 19 years old, and even though I know the risk of having bc is rare, I'm still worried. My right breast started itching about a month ago. And it's a really bad itch.. There are a few lumps on the surface on my breast, but when I press it, it's not hard at all. I guess you could say that my breast is dimpling. My breast has also been giving out some kind of weird discharge that leaves a dried light brown-ish stain on my bras. So- should I be worried?? xxÂ  Log in to post a reply",
