I appreciate everyone's candidacy and openness. My oncologist never discussed onco type with me just that I was stage 11 grade 1 and multi focal so he was glad I decided a mast over lumpectomy. Completed chemo and looking towards Rads but since I'm still learning more about the onco score, I'm hoping to avoid it. If in fact one wasn't preformed on my tumors (2), is it too late to get one done? Thanks for any help around this... Raych",

Sigh... I had one lymph node involved w mast and a close margin which puts me into the rads. I was 35 when I found the lump last year but 36 at dx so on the younger side. Seriously bumbed out about all this, don't know when I'm going to have a day w out crying or having insane mood swings... Thought it was just the chemo but since I'm two weeks complete from that now, I guess this is the new normal. Thank you all, Raych",
