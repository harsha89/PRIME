Nat - I started physical therapy yesterday because I am not happy about my range of motion. Prior to bmx and lymph node removal I worked out 4-5 times each week. While strength training I was using 10 - 12 pound dumbells. After the surgery recovery time (6-8 weeks) my PS told me to limit my potential lymphedema arm to 5 pounds or less. Unfortunately, the physical therapist confirmed this info for me yesterday and said it is unlikely that I will ever lift weights heavier than 5 lbs again :( Another thing to add to the list of this this stupid disease has taken from me.",

Susan I am not sure if I've mentioned this before - sorry chemobrain here- but you and I appear to be on the same treatment plan dose dense 4 AC , 4 Taxol with Herceptin every week for eight weeks of Taxol then switch to Herceptin every 3 weeks for the year.

Road and Susan did you have the Neulasta shot after your 2nd round of Taxol? I had my second round yesterday and Neulasta earlier today. I had it pretty easy after round one of Taxol but I think the neulasta is what really brings on the body pains for me. I had the radiation oncology appointment today. The doctor said that she is leaning towards no radiation for me: 1. the macroscopic (2.1mm) cancer cells in my sentinel are just above the cutoff of 2 mm. She said that the cells may have flattened after dissection when the pathologist put them on the slide under the microscope - weird explanation. 2. I had the double bmx, chemotherapy, herceptin for one year and tamoxifen for five years - I am doing everything possible so she thinks that should be enough. Factor working against me: my age  The radiation onc did not feel confortable comitting to no radiation w/o presenting my case to the Tumor Board (they really couldn't find a better name?) which meets in the middle of this month. I really thought I was going to get a definitive answer today and after being at the dr. office for three hours I wonder why I had to go in at all just to find out that I have to wait 2-3 weeks for an answer. Sorry for the mini vent - I too am tired of this =(",

Susan - big hug to you Virginia- hubby and I missed the family vacation cruise this summer because of surgery/chemo. Your post reminded me that I better start looking forward to next summer and start thinking about where we want to go. So I heard from the radiation onc on Wednesday, hence my two day absence - and the 'Tumor Board' recommend that I have 28 days of radiation to my underarm area. The biggest factor in their decision: my age. I spoke to my breast surgeon yesterday and she explained that the rad onc contacted her and sher voted NO. She explained that because of my clear margins, I had a BMX, I will have 8 rounds of chemo, Tamoxifen for 5 years and Herceptin for 1 year that she felt confident that I didn't need radiation. I guess the rest of the voters felt differently. I am not sure what to do at this point. I know that once this area is radiated I can never have it there again, I worry about upping my chances of lymphedema, I know that the chances are low but I worry it could lead to some other cancer diagnosis. Finally, I know that 50% of patients go on to have problems with the reconsruction. I have a big decision to make. Just as I was beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel - with two more treatments to go - this comes along to knock me back down --- oh, and my bloodwork yesterday showed that my liver enzymes are still elevated so now I'm just waiting for the onc to call and tell me that I probably will not be having treatment on Monday =( Grrrr.... thanking you ladies for letting me vent",

Mainly because I am trying to make myself feel better about it. Short story, every week since surgery I have posted an inspiration quote on my facebook status so friends can follow my progress from surgery/chemo. Well this week I was planning on \"Hair today, gone tomorrow\" that did not go over well with my sister and mother-in-law. Neither cracked a smile - talk about awkward! Again, my small attempt to feel better about it or at least put on a brave face. Life - you go girl! Very impressed by your bravery =) Yesterday I had my second AC treatment and the nurse said \"It's week two - the big week aka hair loss\" I had a cropped bob as of yesterday morning. By 5 pm, I had Ginnifer Goodwin/Emma Watson's hairdo. Today i am experiencing some shedding. They let my cytoxin drip run 45 min instead of 30 min yesterday in hopes of preventing the headache I got last time - so far so good. I felt better today than I did the last day after the chemo. Had my shot at 1pm so I anticipate the pain/sleepiness to set in soon. Hopefully the claritin that I took will help.",

My friend that just finished Taxol had a difficult time with the bone pain but said the side effects she experienced on AC went away during the Taxol treatment. As far as the down time, she was down about three days because of the pain but she did not experience the foggy feeling AC brings. My complexion is terrible!

My doctor told me that I have to stop drinking it because it is such a diuretic (sp?) it can flush the drugs out to quickly. I don't mean to butt in but I thought it was worth mentioning to you.",

Susan - I am glad that you took a few days to think and you are 'at peace' with your decision Today makes 9 days post chemo for me. I had Herceptin on Wednesday and now I do not go back until the Monday after Thanksgiving. It is certainly a strange feeling to not have one single doctor's appt next week. In an attempt to feel normal I called my principal this morning to let her know that I will be returning to work on Monday, 11/19. I'll work for three weeks and then go out on leave again for the exchange surgery on 12/10. In radiation news, I met with the rads onc again after obtaining a second and third opinion. It appears that with all the pieces of my puzzle - age, hist grade, double mastectomy, sentinel node involvement (1), chemo, Herceptin, Tamoxifen - that my chances of recurrence are approx. 10% The radiation will lower the chance of local recurrence by 2% but will not impact other recurrence rates. My rad onc and med onc say that rads or no rads will be considered a reasonable choice for me to make. That being said, I am leaning more towards no rads for me. My hubby has been encouraging me to make a decision before I return to work so that I can stop losing sleep over this and try to \"feel normal\" again.",

I don't recall doing anything to aggrevate it. The second specialist thinks that I already had a 'fragile' lymph system and the surgery just sent it over the edge - I don't know about that. I agree with you, thanks to Mamabr - teachers appreciate your support.  My students have gotten a little bit better but they still have their days.

In fact, I am down from 4  to two pain pills each day. I am waiting to hear if I can take advil or motrin instead of tylenol. My armpits are a bit sore from the drain placement but luckily they are scheduled to be removed on Tuesday afternoon. I am by far more exhausted after this surgery but the dr. said this would happen because I only finished chemo 6 weeks ago and my body os still healing from that. My internal thermostat seemed to settle down for a few nights post-surgery but was back in full furnace effect last night - covers on, covers off, etc. The hair on my head seems to have had a growth spurt this week too. I look forward to starting biotin next week - my doctor kept me off of all vitamins pre-surgery. My eyebrows are starting to show some sign of regrowth but no progress on my spotty eyelashes.

Sadly, it becomes such a \"normal\" part of our routine that you worry once it is over. I finished on 10/31 and the feelings lasted until after my 11/26 Herceptin treatment. I went for Herceptin again on 12/17 and as I sat there I got a little emotional thinking about how far I (and we) have come. I just so happened to get the same chair that I had for the first round of AC (in July) and I think that had something to do with the emotions. Again, it reminded me of how strong we all are and how I could not have gotten this far without all of the support each of you have provided. mss very happy to hear that you are BRCA negative and that the MRI came back clear. You certainly have alot to celebrate! I had my surgical drains removed yesterday - YAY - I feel liberated! Now I must wear a supportive surgical bra (oh so sexy) for 24/7 over the next six weeks.

I returned to work last Tuesday and have been exhausted when I get home each night. The kids have been a little out of hand but seem to be settling down now that they've realized that they are stuck with me for the next six months ;) Last time I posted I shared that the LE specialist that I saw was not going to treat me. Well since then I saw my oncologist and she did not like the looks of my hand and sent me to the LE specialist within MSKCC. Initially I tried to get an appt with her but it takes weeks to get one so I went to this other doctor that I had heard good things about. Anyway, so I saw the MSK specialist on Monday and she was floored to hear that the other woman said I do not need to be treated for lymphedema. She was very concerned about the swelling in my hand and said that the swelling next to my armpit may be the onset of mild LE too.  I will be treated for it from Feb. 11-15th. She has given me 20 exercises to do each day and already ordered me a glove and sleeve. Plus, she got on me about my posture and wants me to try one of those bras that pulls my shoulders back. She said, \"why are you rounding your shoulders like you are trying to potect your chest?\" Gee, I don't know b/c I am six months post BMX and not feeling too good about myself...  I told her to slow down and we'll deal with the LE first and my posture later. The deal is I have to go everyday for one week, two hours each afternoon, for LE massage/drainage and wrapping. I am pissed... but there's nothing I can do about it so I need to put my big girl pants on.  The specialist wants to manage what it already present to make sure that it does not get any worse. On the bright side, at least it is not the 4 week regiment that the first specialist discussed with me. Ok, vent over. Thank you for listening. Facial Hair - where do I start? First let me say that I am lucky, mine is very blonde. I asked my onc. nurse about it and she said it is absolutely related to chemopause and referred to it as - and I am not kidding - Monkey Face.  I will be using wax strips on my \"monkey face\" this weekend.  A colleague told me that when she waxed hers off that it never grew back.  Fingers crossed I have similar luck. Congrats to all that have crossed the rads finish line! All of the women on this board continue to amaze me! Ann, I know it was not the best news to hear but over time you will definitely begin to feel better about it if you should choose to have the mastectomy. Susan, I think of you often and pray that you are doing well.",

I have been wearing scarves with fedoras since Sunday. Funny, I always wanted to wear a fedora, NEVER had the guts/confidence to do it. Now it's all I wear. I tried to wear the scarf alone on Monday and boy did I feel self-conscious. I need to work on that. I wore my wig out to dinner last night with the girls. Again, felt self-conscious, like everyone knew I was wearing it. Anyway, by the end of the night I was relieved to take it off because it was definitely getting itchy. Hope today is a good one for all of you - Hugs!",

The nurses explained that since I had both on the same day it might be difficult to differentiate the SEs for each one. They gave me steroids, benadryl, and pepcid drips before starting the Taxol. Taxol was a three hour infusion and the herceptin was 1.5 hours. They explained that the first round of Herceptin is the longest and each one after will be 30 min. I was there for 6.5 hours on Monday. So far I am experiencing some dull aches in joints that I typically have problems with - my right ankle, my right shoulder and my knee. I had a bit of pain in my sternum earlier today but it seems to have faded. My onc is only giving me the Neulasta after the second round of Taxol which has me a bit concerned.

I am finally beginning to crave vegetables again and plan to make white bean & kale soup this weekend before my next round of Taxol Life so glad to hear that your sweetie is back home with you and lifting your spirits! I am scheduled to see the radiation oncologist on Tuesday afternoon. I am already having anxiety about this appointment. Sorry, about to vent a little - when I was diagnosed in May the surgeon was leaning towards a lumpectomy. I said NO I wanted the double bmx to make sure it was all gone. After surgery she hit me with the chemo news, then two weeks later the HER2/herceptin news. I just hope that maybe I can catch a little bit a of break on this one and not need the radiation. But in the pit of my stomache I feel like they will want me to have it because I am young and they want to take every precaution possible - okay vent over thank you for listening to me.

Met with oncologist yesterday who was very surprised to heard that I am leaning towards no rads - against the recommendation of the board. SHe encouraged me to get a second opinion before committing to this choice. I asked a lot of questions regarding stats about my staging, lymph node involvement and chance of recurrence if I choose to do rads vs. not and sadly she was unable to provide any. This upset me because I've looked for studies on Sloan Kettering's site, Johns Hopkins, and MD Anderson - having little luck I thought that my oncologist of all people might be able to provide this. So I will be looking for a doctor to get a second opinion and still awiting news from my breast surgeon who requested that the pathology dept re-examine my slides. In other news, I started one-on-one counseling last week. Having never done this before, I found it very interesting and look forward to this week's appt. Tonight, I will be attending a support group meeting which meets twice each month - once for group discussion the second time for meditation/guided imagery and then reiki.

I am curious to hear what the radiation oncologist says during the consult but hoping that as you said, it's nothing more than a conversation saying 'No rads' Please keep us posted as I am still awaiting more info about whether or not I should do the rads Susan - I am glad the event was such a sucess but sorry to hear that you still aren't doing well with the side effects. Any east coast dwellers around here besides myself and City?  This Hurricane Sandy / \"Frankenstorm\" is quite the story in NY. It's supposed to make landfall sometime tomorrow. While I am concerned about everyone's safety there is part of me that is saying: \"Hey Hurricane Sandy, B*tch, maybe you haven't heard but I am scheduled to have my last Taxol treatment tomorrow. If you go screwing this up for me...\" Okay, I vented about the storm. Fingers crossed it is safe enough to go for treatment in the morning.",

Instead of having it Monday, I had it yesterday.  The treatment center was packed as they were trying to get all of the cancellations from Monday and Tuesday accomodated in one day. Many people were unable to get in, including their nurses.  The building was running on generators and had limited electricity but the nurses were calm the entire time and everyone was extra nice to one another. Since I rec'd Herceptin yesterday after the Taxol, my Herceptin schedule has changed a bit and instead of being a \"Monday patient\" I have been switched to Wednesdays. After next week's Herceptin I will not go back until after Thanksgiving. I expected the last round to bring lots of excitement and positive feelings but with everything that is happening here on Long Island I was like \"ok, it's over.\" I hope to have more of a celebration after things settle down around here. I have the follow-up appt with the radiation onc tomorrow to ask a few more questions before making my decision.  Last week I went for 2nd and 3rd opinions outside of the hospital network I am in and both doctors said that if I were their patient they would not be treating me with radiation because the cells in the sentinel node were microscopic and they were more concerned that the long term effects of rads might outweigh the treatment.  As I said, I am bringing these concerns, more questions, and more to the doctor tomorrow. Our house has been without power since 3 pm on Monday. Fortunately, husband's best friend never lost his power (by some miracle) and he was more than happy to take us in. So I plan to rest on his couch, instead of my own, while I recuperate from this last round of Taxol.",

My sister's boyfriend, also hubby's best friend, took us in all week after the hurricane. Nat - school was canceled all week and still waiting to hear what this week brings. My principal reported that the building was not damaged but many of the surrounding streets had some big issues preventing people from getting to the building. Life - CONGRATS! I am so happy that you finished! As so many have pointed out, sisters are such a gift in life. I don't how I would have gotten through this if I didn't have my sister. Since I've been away from work, my husband has spent a great deal of time at his job and my sister took me to every single chemo treatment. I continue to pray for your sister. Susan - I am also sending you a big hug and positive energy.",

I was diagnosed in May, surgery in June, and started treatment in July. I have missed 2.5 months of work and will be returning next week, which is 2.5 weeks post chemo. I am going to work for 3 weeks before I go out on leave again for my exchange surgery. Then, I hope to return to work by mid-January. I elected not to work because I was fearful of the kids' germs. Thankfully, I had enough sick days banked to use so I did not have to go without pay - such a blessing.  I am still concerned about the germs but I need to feel a little normal which is why I am going back for what I am calling a \"limited engagement\"",

I think I over did it a little during the holidays because my right hand, near my thumb, is slightly swollen. My BS said it could be residual swelling from surgery but it could also be mild lymphedema. I am awaiting an appt with the lymphedema specialist. It has been the same size for a few days now. Fingers crossed it will be okay. Had my 6 month check-up last Thursday. The breast surgeon said \"It's all over now. This is behind you.\" Good words to hear, made me breakdown right there in her office.",
