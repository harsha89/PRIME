Had to go get another one on Tuesday because a letter in the mail last week, stated they had found some tiny specs on the right breast.So I went this Tuesday and got a digital one done. The Dr spoke to me afterwards and she showed me the films.She said she really thought they were like calcium deposits and she showed me on the films. (I did stop breast feeding about 8 months ago, does this have something to do with it or maybe the thyroid pill I take? Levoxyl) Tiny, tiny little dots.Well today after getting home from running errands, there was a frantic message on my home answering machine.It was the Dr who reads the mamograms. She told me she had dreamt about me on Wed night and that her gut feelings told her to take another look at my mamogram slides. She said she has scheduled me for a biopsey on the right breast without my consent (b/c she said she knew I would want to), for next Thursday.She said out of the 4-5 little specs, 2 of them look different from the others. I don't get what she's talking about. She showed me the slides that one day, close up & all and all these dots looked the same. She even bragged that day that she has been doing this line of work for over 23 yrs and she knows they are calcium. Now she says, \"her gut\" tells her otherwise. She says she will try and reach my Primary Dr on Tuesday to fill him in. She tells me to have a good weekend and to not lose sleep over this. Well, thanks alot I say...she says these dots are smaller than a pencil eraser and there is nothing to worry about. Well guess what? I am worried. There is no family history of breast cancer.
