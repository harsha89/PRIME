No bras, no antiperspirants, organiic food, no hair spray, etc, etc. Read a great book by English PHd geologist, \"You Are In Control of Your Life\". She believes that we have too much plastic  near our food. I stopped storing food in plastic bags. Nowe after  8 years the pains in my chest have started. Three very bad attacks, thought I was having a heart attack.. Drs in hospital didn;'t  know what it was. Finally an Emergency dr  in neighborhood Urgent Care diagnosed it as Costochondritis. What is your opinion  on this   common side effect? Do I have to live with this forever, with only ibuprofin and acetaminophen to control? Thanks R",
