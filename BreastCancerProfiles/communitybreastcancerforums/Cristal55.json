Last year July I noticed that under my right armpit was very swollen and painful to touch it was worse during my time of the month. I waste no time in seeing my gp who gave me a breast exam and said it felt like fatty tissue in my armpit but still sent me to the breast clinic who then told me that they couldn't see anything on the scan or feel anything during the physical examination and recommended starflower oil for breast pain and it's more than likely that my harmones are to blame. A week ago I started having sharp pains under my right breast along with a fever I decided to go to a&e where a doctor told me I have a lump on the upper outer quadrant of my right breast. It's extremely painful to the touch and everything hurts on my right side. I've been referred to the breast clinic again and I'm waiting. Worry is clouding my mind any advice would be appreciated. Thanks Log in to post a reply",
