We have an appointment with the oncologist in a few days and I want to have the right questions to ask.  She was also told that she should take Tomaxafin and from my research has a lot of side affects especially in the elderly.  She was told that 20% of this kind goes on to develop into an invasive cancer but on the other hand from research it seems that it grows slower in the elderly.  She wants to wait and take Tamoxifen and see what happens.  She is probably right but with all the research I am trying to do I have not come up with feeling any better about the special care of this age group.  What questions do we need to ask. Until now she and her husband saw the doctors alone. I was but the driver, but now they have asked me to go with them to the oncologist, so that I could ask the \"right questions\".  Thank you for any help or advise in advance. Log in to post a reply",
