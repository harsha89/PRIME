Last week my mom had a dry cough, and then she couldn't breathe. Of course my mom and I assumed she was sick, or had pneumonia. I took her to urgent care, and when they took her vitals they told my mom she needed to go to the ER. I didn't want to take any chances and neither did she, so I rushed her to the nearest hospital. She had an X-ray and ct scan done, and when the doctor came in he was like \"ok after that ct scan I think we have a better idea of what this is, this looks like breast cancer. Your entire left lung is surrounded by fluid.\" So she was admitted into the hospital. We had no idea it would then turn into an 8 day stay filled with hopelessness and anxiety. My mom had to have two Thoracentesis procedures done to drain fluid, and a biopsy. They tested the fluid for malignancy, and it was in fact positive...so being her daughter I googled like crazy. Everything I've seen says this is not a good sign, that the pleural effusions usually signal serious cancer. I can't sleep, shower, eat, etc. I also keep looking to the future. I'm only 26 years old, I am not equipped to deal with this emotionally or mentally. I'm the only child, so I have no siblings to lean on and my family is very small. I have supportive friends, my dad, and dads side of the family. But if I lost my mom, I'm not quite sure how I'll live or move forward. Or have a normal life. I need input from someone who has gone through something similar, or can give me hope. Help. Log in to post a reply",
