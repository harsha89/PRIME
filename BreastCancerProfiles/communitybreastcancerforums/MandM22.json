I am just two weeks out of my 1st TCH treatment, so I haven't had as much yuck as the rest of you. I have been scanning the pages for all of the advice that you have shared about SE and quick remedies so hopefully I can bounce back quick. Ishobie- I had the same problem with weight loss after the first treatment.  I lost 8 pounds and was having trouble keeping anything in my system. Doctor had me try what I call a white diet because everything general is white in color. I ate (white bread, mashed potatoes, white rice, vanilla yogurt and eggs) to name a few. Seemed to help get my system back on track. Keep up the good fight ",
