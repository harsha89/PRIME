My mammo interpretation left little hope that I would escape the world of breast cancer, and biopsy during the holidays made for a lingering return on the pathology report, with lots of time to educate oneself on a diagnosis I was certain would befall me.   I am, however, here to tell you all never to give up hope. Never.  A friend of mine held my hand during this awful time even though she is 1000 miles away, and I want you to know I am holding all of your hands.  macsmom ",
