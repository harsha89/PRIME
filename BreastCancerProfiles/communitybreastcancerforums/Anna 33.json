We get the Ibrance (medicine) only for the two first years but I think after those two years you have trial-followups three more years (once yearly). The aim is that they hope the medicine kill eventually remaining cancercells to decrease the risk of local recurrence and other mets. Everybody in the trials medicinearm get Ibrance, antihormones (aromataseinhibitators or tamoxifen) and premenopausales do get zoladex as well. With hormonesensitive breastcancer the risk of recurrence unfortunately last for years .... I have heard that the highest incidence of mets in hormonsensitive breast cancer is between year two and six, but some get mets before or after that. Still most do not get mets... I can not lift weights, but that is due to lymphedema ;( Good luck! Keep us updated",
