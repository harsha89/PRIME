I am so happy to be alive but I have this constant fear there are cells still in there somewhere and the more I read, seems the more likely they are.  I think I was more positive until somebody asked the questions of in fact, wasn't it almost worse to have grade 1 since chemo won't help with it and its almost just dormant.  I had stage 1, grade 1, and didn't have chemo or radiation, which I am glad of but them, I worry something was missed but my doctor says my cancer responds more likely to hormone therapy instead of chemo. I don't know if this fear will ever go away and I worry that having that fear, will in the long run, cause my fears to come true.  I think stress makes it all worse.  For the most part, people around me think I'm doing fine and physically for now, I am but I guess its the fact that this can happen with no warning and you can have something growing that could be killing you and you aren't even sick..

As it turned out, I had cancer in the right breast and had calcifications in the left but they required no surgery. So, weird thing is, the pain led me to the testing, but the cancer side was not having any pain. The MRI did find more things that needed attention in the right breast, but still nothing on the left. I kept saying are you sure nothing on the left, because its the one that had been bothering me but they said no, nothing there. I am grateful that I did have that pain, because had I not, no telling when I would have forced myself to seek attention.

I do agree it was short lived pain, only a few seconds, but for those seconds, it was bad and yes, the tech and person doing the injection said they knew it was painful and said they were sorry.  This was not for the wire guided, it was for the sentinel testing, so maybe some of these people are referring to injections given in the breast rather than the nipple area.",

I was blessed that it was stage 1, even though since it was also grade 1, they estimate it likely had been there a while, but it was invasive, which is why I will never be able to feel safe, even though it was small, it was still invasive and nobody really knows if any of those cells escaped and I dont think the general public understands that.",

My story is too long to write but what I can tell you is that I did have all the biopsies done and they are done with a needle and are not anything to fear, I mean, pain wise.  As it turned out, the side with calcficaitons was fine and nothing else was needed.  The other side, not so lucky.  If I were in your shoes, I would just have the biopsy and not delay it.  I never saw an oncologist until I was told I had cancer but that was not on the side with the problems like you are having, it was on the opposite side.  If your biopsy is clear, you won't need an oncologist, and I hope that is what happens in your case.  I had not had a mammogram for 20 years and I was blessed mine had not spread further than it did but you are early, you get that biopsy done and do it soon.

On the plus side though, you only have to deal with being uncomfortable on one side and know going in that you will have good use of your arm on the good side, although, I had no issues with my arm on the mastectomy side. I've recently had my exchange surgery and lift on the natural side, so this is the first time I've had some discomfort on both sides at the same time, and only having one side with issues is good too. Bottom line, you have to do what you feel is best for you. Good luck. I can tell you the surgery for the mastectomy is not nearly as bad as I feared it would be.",

Then, I had a MRI and it found another issue, which was benign but was located directly under my nipple so the surgeon said taking that and the other two tumors I had would leave me disfigured. I said, compared to what????????? I mean really. So, mastectomy was what I had to face and I will tell you, I was devastated. I am 58 and heavy, so I was no pin up girl and sure didn't think I would be walking around naked but just the idea of it, just totally upset me. I sat and cried and cried and said I just don't want to do this. So I was sure in no frame of mind to do both sides. I had been praying from the beginning that God would show me what was the right surgery for me and when I decided on the lumpectomy and then, this ohter thing was found, I looked at it as he answered my question and made that choice for me, so mastectomy it was. As it turned out, they did find things in the surgery that the surgeon said would have likely made it impossible to get clear margins and it was a good thing I had the mastectomy. Plus, I did not have to deal with radiation. So, I had the uni mastectomy with tissue expander placed at time of surgey. I did not think I initially would want reconstruction but the further I got in, the less I wanted to deal forever with special bras and all of that, so I did opt for reconstruction. The mastectomy is kind of weird because it is pretty much numb after surgery so not a lot of pain. Drains are aggravating but not painful and like some have said, the incision for the lymph nodes was probably the most uncomfortable but not terribly painful.",

I see ladies on here who had a recurrence in the tiny amount of tissue left by a mastectomy. Did you take any meds after that first cancer?",

It also varies by state.  I live in Kentucky and there are no requirements but my breast center is in Tennessee and in that state, they are required to notify you that you have dense breast, which they did on my follow up letter.",

It was no problem, it was outpatient, no pain, you really can't even tell where the incision is. The plus was, literally within hours of the surgery, I felt totally different. I had gotten to the point I was so stiff, I could barely walk or get in or our of my car. That first weekend we went for a ride, I told my husband, hey look at me, I'm getting out of the car without holding on or grunting. It was like a miracle to me. I could feel myself getting stronger every day after that surgery.",

I had an ultrasound at my local doctor's office and it did not find the bad gland but then I went to a specialist and they did find it on ultrasound. My incision was small and if I didn't point at it,I don't think you would see it. He did a very good job on that. I was amazed at how different I felt after that surgery. He estimated I had probably had the problem for 8 years before it got that bad and he said you don't get a high level like that over night. It can cause a lot of serious problems for your system, so don't wait to long to explore it.",

I have to admit, I had not had a mammogram in 20 years, I am 58.  I really wanted to beat myself up over this in the beginning but then I began to think, you know what, I would have still had cancer even if I had a mammogram for the last 10 years or whatever.  I mean, my having the mammogram would not have prevented this cancer. Yes, maybe it would have been found earlier or maybe it would not, who knows.  I talked with a lady at a recent appointment while waiting for testing and she had first been diagnosed 12 years ago and she said she had mammograms faithfully every year and still, when hers was found, 1 year after a clean bill of health, it was already stage 3, so it came up that fast.  I am not sure why God choose to have me deal with this but I know he did and it was found when it was meant to be found. So, now all we can do is deal the best we can. Thoughts are with you.",
