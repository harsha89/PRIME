The core biopsy was OK - not as sore as I expected.  She gave me a numbing shot before each one.  I had to lie on my side with my arm over my head, and my arm went to sleep.  It wasn't pleasant, but not as bad as I'd expected.  They let me keep my sweater on over the gown I was given, so I wasn't cold.  Ice packs afterwards for 6 hours helped a lot - and it wasn't bad, because my breast stayed pretty numb, so the cold didn't really bother me.  I think it really helped with swelling and bruising.  I had little x tapes that were supposed to stay on for 5 days.  Good luck to you - I've heard plenty of women who got GOOD news after the core biopsy.  Hope you're one of them.",
