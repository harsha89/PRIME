After my 2nd tx. though, the hair went quickly. It was difficult at first, but it is funny how you, your family, and friends adjust to your \"hairlessness.\" We laughed and I was called everything from \"Beetlejuice\" to as of lately \" Uncle Fester\". Laughter is the best medicine!!  Chemo goes by quickly and before you know it, you feel the top of your head and alas there is hair \"sprouting\" Yahoo!!!    Good Luck to you!!! ",

I am keeping an eye on it every day to see if it falls out!  I went to see Andrew Disimone for my wig ( he is owner of the FaceStation Salon) on Lexington Ave. (few blocks from Sloan Kettering) and he was wonderful. He donates some of his time to the ACS,cutting and styling wigs.  He is also a colorist ( worked for Louis Licari) . Just a recommendation for you, in case you want to go the professional route",
