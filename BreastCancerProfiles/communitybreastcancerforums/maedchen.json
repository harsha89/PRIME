First BC and the mets now was/are ER+, HER- I had a Carboplatin+Abraxane Chemo for 8 months, then Tamoxifen for 6 months and now that my last CT shows new multiple small (under 5 mm) mets I switched to Fosladex. I just had my first shot of 500ml and hoping it will work THE WONDER for me. I am only 34 and had my first BC at 25. I have two questions: How long would you expect for a hormone positive cancer to live with mets in the lung? Do you COUGH every once and a while DESPITE you are stable right now? I am coughing like everytime the second I start eating something (anything). When I don't eat I don't cough. I only would cough (when not eating) when there's someone using a deodorant or perfume beside me, etc. - obviously my lungs are sensible to any irritations. How are your lungs doing now at Stage IV - can you breathe well and not cough? Is coughing always a sign for progression!? Thank you so much for caring to answer me! M. ",

As I am coughing only when eating I also (and my doctors) think it has to do with some acid reflux. I also breathe normal, I just might get out of breath when climbing the stairs or carying my daughter but normal people get that too. I hope the Fosladex which I just began will work for me. Tamoxifen obviously didn't work (I was 6 months on it), but doctors say Fosladex is actually a better drug as it surpresses all sensors of the cancer cells while Tamoxifen only some (I put this in simple, unprofessional words, I hope you know better than me what it means). To Robin - I haven't got my ovaries removed, but I get Enantone (Leuprorelin) to surpress their function so I am in the menopause so to speak. Doctors say that is all the same and nowadays one doesn't have to have them removed. What you all must know and this is what can be eather my 'joker' in the therapy or not - back then in 2006 when first diagnosed, I did only chemotherapy and NO antihormone therapy, as my cancer was stage 1, no malign lymph nodes, so I decided against Tamoxifen despitite the advice of the doctors. I don't regret this decision, now I am a mother of a sunny 3-year-old daughter. So the big question is, whether cancer would have come back if I had taken Tamoxifen, who knows... At the same time, obviously now that the mets have been progressing Tamoxifen (after carboplatin + abraxane chemo was successful), I would say, it was a good decision not taking Tamoxifen back then.... I have alsoa question, which certainly has been asked in this forum, but I maybe it could be modified for persons with lung mets - do you take any supplements which are specific for the lungs, i.e. - to keep your 'ill' lungs in best form possible. For example, I read once somewhere that Zink is good for the function of the lungs. Or Vitamin C (for the whole body anyway) . Other sources say, 'don't tak Vitamin C not to push your cancer grow further!' So the question is- whom to trust?! Do you take supplements (for lungs function in particular) or others? Talk to you all soon, enjoy the summer!!!! M.",
