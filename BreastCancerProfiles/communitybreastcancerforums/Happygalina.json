I thought about using a wheelchair, but i feel guilty about it because I CAN walk, just not far and standing in one spot is even more difficult. Do any of you use one? Im Stage 3 Breast Cancer with 4 lymph nodes involved. Just competed 3 months of the Red Devil and starting 3 mouths of Taxotere today. Followed by a double mastectomy and radiation.
