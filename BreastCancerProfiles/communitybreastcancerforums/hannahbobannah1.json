I am writing as my mother-in-law was diagnosed with metaplastic breast cancer back in November 08. She had a full mastectomy but has since had four reoccurrences. She has just discovered another lump while having radiotherapy, but that is the only treatment she has had so far. I am just wondering if anyone else out there has had this kind of cancer and what treatment they had. Log in to post a reply",
