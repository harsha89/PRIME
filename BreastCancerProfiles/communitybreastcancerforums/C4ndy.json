I saw it when they put it in and it is like a snippet of wire. Mine was inserted 18 months ago and yes it still hurts. When I went for my last mammogram they ended up having to do a spot magnification on something else near that spot and it hurt A LOT. The technician talked like this was normal, since I had a marker near there.",
