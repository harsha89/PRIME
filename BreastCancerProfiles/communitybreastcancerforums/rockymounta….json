Either a State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP) counselor (every state has them, see the Medicare website) or, especially if you are under 65, a broker who knows Medicare inside and out. As for which plan to choose, Medicare supplement plans are standardized and you pick the one that offers the level of coverage that you want. Plan F, which pays your share of the charges for all Medicare-approved services, is probably the most popular, and Plan G, which pays everything except the annual deductible, is also popular. In some circumstances, you can avoid having your pre-existing conditions considered in determining whether you can get supplemental coverage and at what price. Obviously, this is highly desirable if you actually have a pre-existing condition, especially a serious one such as breast cancer. For example, under federal law, insurers offering Medicare supplement policies cannot refuse to sell you a policy or charge you higher premiums because of a pre-existing condition, if 1) you are over 65, and 2) you apply within six months of enrolling in Part B. If you are under 65, or if you aren't covered by the federal law because you aren't within the six-month window for initial enrollment in a supplement plan, then you need to check and see if your state provides some protection against the pre-existing conditions problem. Some states are more helpful than others in that regard. You can see why an expert might come in handy in figuring out what your options are. You are very wise to start thinking about this before you need to make a decision. I hope you will find the coverage that you want without too much trouble!",

You certainly have a lot to deal with, and I wish you all the best as you go forward. I'm sure you will find a lot of support here. I hope that I can help you a little with your Medicare questions since I retired this year and signed up for Medicare Parts B and D (I already had A) as well as a Medicare supplement plan. I did all this after the age of 65, and as you have already noticed, signing up after 65 complicates things. Basically, Medicare expects you to enroll at age 65, and you will face financial penalties if you enroll after your initial enrollment period ends. You can avoid those penalties if you can show that you qualify for a special enrollment period, and if you enroll during that period. However, the rules that govern who qualifies for a special enrollment period can be very complicated and confusing. For example, if you delayed enrolling in Medicare because you were working and had health insurance through an employer, and if the employer employs more than 20 people, your employer-provided insurance is your primary insurance for as long as you have it, Medicare is secondary, and when you lose your primary insurance because of retirement or some other event, you qualify for a special enrollment period for Part B and another for Part D. (I think there is also a special enrollment period for Part A in this situation, but since I had enough work credits to qualify for premium-free Part A, I just signed up for it at 65 and didn't have to worry about it.) What if your employer employs fewer than 20 people? That's a different situation entirely. Because this can be complicated, I suggest that your first step, once you have had a chance to catch your breath, should be to educate yourself on the subject of special enrollment periods. If you aren't sure how the rules will apply in your specific situation, the Medicare website has a list of the agencies in each state that can provide \"personalized health insurance counseling.\" Assuming that you will qualify for special enrollment periods for the various parts of Medicare, you don't need to do anything until the special enrollment periods begin. At that point, or shortly before, I suggest that you begin gathering the documentation that you will need to show that you are entitled to a special enrollment period and should not be charged a penalty for late enrollment. Don't delay too long in getting started, because someone, somewhere, will mess you up. True story: to get penalty-free Part D coverage, I had to show that I had creditable drug coverage during the five years between the time when I became eligible for Medicare and the time when I retired. But, instead of sending out annual letters certifying creditable drug coverage, my employer had fallen into the habit of sending out a generic \"Dear Employee\" email every year that directed employees to see a special section of the employer's website for copies of policies that applied to us and other important documents. The annual certificate of creditable drug coverage was buried in there. It took me almost a month to convince the personnel office that a series of generic emails which did not contain my name, and which directed me to a series of certificates of creditable drug coverage which also did not contain my name, would not be accepted as proof that I had creditable drug coverage during the five years for which I needed to show coverage. I was ready to tear my hair out. As for Medicare supplement policies, the good news is that you can apply any time. However, there is a huge advantage to applying within six months after you get Part B, because if you do it then, insurers can't deny you coverage or charge you higher premiums because of a pre-existing health problem. If you apply outside of that period, in most states they can (and most likely will) either deny coverage or charge higher premiums for health problems. A few states don't allow such scummy practices, but you would have to check to see if your state is among them. I hope this makes Medicare enrollment a little less confusing. If I have unintentionally made it MORE confusing, I humbly apologize.",
