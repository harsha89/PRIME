On Oct. 4, I started feeling an uncomfortable sensation in my right foot. Primarily big toe, but other toes as well. Looked at my foot and it was turning very red, almost purple. Only happens when sitting still. Once I move, back to normal color. I have never had any circulation problems in my life. Went to podiatrist to start. Felt pulses, checked toes for circulation....all good. Felt it is Reyanuds Phenomenon. I am very uneasy about the whole thing and am going to another doctor, this time vascular. I googled and read and no where does it say radiation can cause these issues. Anyone ever had a strange unexplained thing happen after rads? I think it is just coincidental, but so frustrated as I am dealing with anxiety from the whole breast cancer diagnosis so I am waiting for something bad happen. NJ Log in to post a reply",

I had a lumpectomy on my left breast, had under the muscle silicon implants prior to diagnosis.  Not one doctor suggested a mastectomy because of implants.  (I did go for several opinions) Again, I understand each case is different, and there may be more factors involved, but for me the implants would not determine going from a lumpectomy to a mastectomy. Talk to your RO.   Mine was just phenomenal.  I did go to a very well known hospital and had a top doc.  I think the key for me was being comfortable and trusting my doctors.  There was a big difference in going to the RO in the top hospital as opposed to the one locally in that the local doctor didn\u2019t care what my personal situation was, he was just administering a set dose of radiation over a set amount of weeks. Everyone that had DCIS (no matter grade, size, etc.) got the same treatment.  The RO I went with tailored my radiation to what MY diagnosis was.  Took everything into account.  So if I went local I would have had 6 weeks radiation whole breast, but I went to NYC and had 4 weeks, the last week being the boost, and not whole  breast. The travel was nuts, but it was so worth it to feel comfortable with my decision. That being said, I was nervous about CC.  I am 6 months out and (knock on wood) just fine.  I do still use the Calendula cream religiously.  I will do that for at least a full year.  My opinion would be you can cross that bridge if it ever comes, but why cross now.  Again, just my thoughts. I wish you the best of luck.  I know how stressful this is.   Sincerely, NJ ",

I just \u201cjumped the gun\" lol as is my nature in a way....always wanting to know what is next, especially knowing I had implants in the mix. I had zero confidence in the first doctor I met. He came highly recommended through a friend, was local. As I mentioned, everyone is treated the same.....no matter what the type of DCIS. I went to a surgeon in NYC, again through recommendation. It was the difference between night and day. They are at the forefront of research, top of the line equipment. She used something called the margin probe in surgery to make sure margins are clear of cancer. They use the savi scout to place the marker prior to surgery. And what a difference in approach and treatment. As I mentioned, I LOVED my RO. It is important to feel confident in your doctors. I was treated for what I had, not a blanket treatment. As far as my lumpectomy, 10 days later I was back to running. I ran through my 4 weeks of radiation, fatigue was never an issue.(Calendula cream was and still is my best friend) I did have my Mom living with us which was a huge help being it was Septmber and back to school ( I have 3 kids). So with the support of my family, the hardest part for me was the travel. 2 hours each way for a quick treatment of radiation. Worth every minute as far as I am concerned to feel at peace with my decision. Best of luck to you, NJ",

My OR says there is nothing I can do to prevent CC if it is going to happen. It may or may not, and won\u2019t be evident right away, rather in months or a year. Anyone facing something similar?

My RO says no. Best of luck to everyone. NJmom",
