I can really understand how overwhelming the diagnosis and all the researching can be.  Hours and hours of reading and learning helped me to feel at least a little in control and more focused somehow.  There is a huge amount of information on this site and many women who will be glad to help with any questions you may have.   Praying for you, that God will guide you safely through surgery and help you to make the right decisions for treatment options.  ",

I remember when we were talking about this on a previous thread, that I found some information on an internet search that for women who are overweight (me included here), a diagonal incision can often get better, smoother results.   If I had only know that before the bilateral!  A great surgeon or surgical team (ps included) can make a difference.     Blessings!",

My fingers seem normal in both color and temperature.  My little finger, knuckle, base of hand definitely is more uncomfortable/painful when I'm trying to bend my fingers down to do something, (like typing), but better when resting or holding fingers straight.  Is it possible I held my finger funny (arched up) while being bandaged?  The area across my palm just below fingers might be more swollen, but that's hard to tell for sure under the bandages. The top of my arm feels like there is a slight rolling/bunching/pinching going on at the edge and I keep trying to stick my fingers in there and straighten it out.  I was thinking about trying to unloosen just a bit at the top and flatten it out some.  There is also just a little wrinkling at the wrist, so maybe the bandages have slipped down a little?   I'm scheduled back with my therapist tomorrow late morning, then the plan is to skip to Friday.  Thanks again for being such great supporters and mood boosters!  It really helps so much just to have someone to talk to about all this.  ",

      "Content": "Feb 4, 2010 01:01PM - edited Feb 12, 2010 08:26AM by Sher I was hoping to have my hand and arm wrapped only to the elbow, but there was a measurable difference in whole arm size since early December, so had to go the whole nine yards........probably literally in bandage length.  Wednesday, I was taught to wrap (fingers included) and practiced several times with therapist coaching.  There had been a little more swelling at my palm under fingers, so she used 2 rolls of the gauze stuff on my hand.  It all felt a little too tight when I left and later that night, my hand was very uncomfortable and achy.  With all the wrap on it, I could hardly bend it at all, typing not just difficult, but impossible - and also thought my fingertips looked more swollen and purplish.  So I unwrapped and removed down to and including the second layer of gauze on hand, then proceeded to rewrap with the rest.  What a job!  Taping the ends with one hand is unbelievable and of course, the ends always happen on the back side of my arm. This morning my hand was even more uncomfortable and fingertips seemed more swollen.  So I unwrapped and found the swelling had increased in my hand and fingers over what it was to begin with.  Panicky, I called my therapist because I was afraid I put the bandages on too tight and she calmed me down and went over the how to's and encouraged me to try again.  1/2 hour later, I still hadn't even managed to get my hand and fingers wrapped successfully - kept ending up with not enough to wrap my thumb.  Finally I got that part done and started the other bandages.  The first roll went on rather nicely (only had to restart 3 or 4 times to get the hand right) and then I realized that I forgot to put the stockinette on first!  The whole thing is on now, feels pretty comfortable (I can bend hand and arm and type with limited amount of flubs) and so now I'm second guessing and worrying that maybe it is too comfortable and so not \"snuggly\" enough - what my therapist calls it.  Through this all I have managed to yell, swear, cry, laugh and keep reminding myself that since you all wrap successfully and competantly,  hopefully I will too!   ",

Guess I've been in denial about my LE.  These subtle symptoms and swellings I've had are probably why my therapist thinks I'll end up with full blown LE someday.  The part that gets me the most upset is wrapping.  I can deal with wearing a compression sleeve and glove during the day and even wearing a night sleeve, but wrapping is just too much for me to deal with myself.  And going to the therapist daily is out of the question.  I can manage an abbreviated massage - lymphatic duct by collar bone, shoulder, axillary, arm and hand, which I can do while sitting and watching TV, but I usually eliminate the rest - abdomen, chest, down along side and inguinal nodes which I had been taught to do.  Is just doing a shortened version of massage  (including deep breathing) helpful at all? ",

Right about now I'm feeling pretty dumb!  I read these boards all the time and know that I should have been better prepared.  Maybe I should have been wearing at least a glove while working............what's that saying about 'hindsight'? ",

Wrapping is what has me most upset.  I can deal with sleeves, gloves, night sleeves, but wrapping is something else.  My problem is that I'm kind of a personal hygiene clean freak and would never, ever crawl into bed without a shower, which I should still be able to do with some kind of baggie thing over my arm, but the wrap won't be clean.   Sounds dumb, huh, but that is a real hangup for me.  If I get to the point where I would need to wrap myself, I worry that I won't be able to do it correctly because of my arthritis.  Any suggestions for me in preparation for having my arm wrapped in the way of clothes, baggies, gloves, etc?  I'm already thinking it would be good to have some of the medical gloves on hand to keep the hand wrap clean and dry for stuff like hair gel, meal prep, bathroom, etc.  Am I going to be able to, or should I use my hand normally?  Probably typing won't be easy.  Other stuff I should know?    ",

      "Content": "Feb 19, 2010 09:02PM - edited Feb 20, 2010 03:29PM by Sher Hi Binney North American did send me what I ordered - unfortunately  I was confused between what their printed order form listed and what I saw when I ordered online.   I should have ordered TG Cotton Stockinette. When I met with my therapist today, I learned that the jersey tubular she has is actually Sammons Preston - she just has NA order forms on hand and tells patients that several places sell the same products - just shop for best prices.  She also said that she didn't want to use Artiflex on me because I have kind of sensitive skin.  When I showed her the TG Soft Tubular, she thought it would be good because of it's thickness and also to provide a little padding.  So when I got home I called Bandages Plus and spoke with a woman who said she is a LE therapist.  I was told that TG Soft is meant to be used for padding in small areas, for under casts, etc and not meant to be used for the whole arm LE wrapping first layer.......something to do with differences in circumference, etc.  This didn't seem to make sense to me since the TG Soft is 85% cotton and 15% elastin and \"can be stretched 5 times it's width\".   I purchased the size medium for arm or lower leg. So, now I'm torn between wanting to try it because of the thickness and being afraid to for fear it would somehow make my LE worse.  The Cotton Stockinette from Sammons Preston is 100% cotton and shrinks back to shape when washed and dryed, but quickly bags out, wrinkles and falls down while I'm trying to wrap  the short stretch bandages over it.  Since I seem to remember that bandages can't be returned and this might apply to TG Soft as well, do you think I should I just give it a try? The woman from Bandages Plus recommended Caresia and said I could layer short stretch over it and later when finished with my therapy, add a lycra sleeve on top to make it function as a night garment - I'd still have to bandage my fingers. It's good to have all these choices, I guess, but with me being an OCD perfectionist who usually has a terrible time making up her mind, it can be very confusing! ",

In the meantime I'll order the jersey cotton stockinette from Bandages Plus that you use.  On their website they state that arms usually need 8 or 10 cm.  Do you know how that would compare to actual arm size? ",

Tuesday afternoon I noticed swelling on the top of my hand and as is probably pretty common, cannot pinpoint a trigger.......it just is.  Thinking back, I do remember my forearm feeling bit odd a few days earlier - sometimes like a hair or feather was brushing against and tickling the skin also a slight feeling of heaviness or just something that felt different so these were maybe warning signs.   So yesterday dug out my daytime compression stuff, information on wrapping (had long since forgotten how to do this), exercises etc and back on this site for a refresher coarse.  Will also need to make an appointment with my therapist - this time around would like to get fitted for a longer glove.  Swelling isn't terrible, but quite noticeable top of hand and a little above my wrist - same area as originally and I want to do whatever I can to prevent it from worsening.......maybe hopefully getting back to where I was. One thing I'd like to ask is about nerve impingement.  Before the swelling returned, I had a lot of pain in my neck and shoulder area on LE side (have pretty bad osteoarthritis and see a chiropractor regularly).  Yesterday he mentioned nerve impingement which may have caused the hair/feather tickling sensations (also had pins and needles thing going on along with the pain).  Might this impingement also have disrupted the lymph flow?

There also isn't much of a thumb on the F to A Tribute. Caresia told my therapist that they had changed the finger end from flat to curved on both gloves, but haven't done this on the F to A Tribute for some reason.  This they would be happy to do if requested......problem is they don't make it known ahead of time.  Any photos of these products don't show the fingertips (and I've searched a lot!), so my Tribute was a complete surprise!

When addressing my concerns because of lymphedema, couple things came up that I need help with. Original treatment - lumpectomy and axillary node dissection in 2000, then after local recurrence in 2008 had bilateral mastectomy.....lymphedema started 2010. So I understand no BP, IV on left arm and have manual BP done on right wrist/forearm with pediatric cuff, but this I know is not possible in an operating room. No nodes removed on the prophylactic side, but still I'm very cautious with that arm while coping with lymphedema in the opposite arm. The anesthesiologist said an arterial line could be used for BP during surgery only and would be removed right after. Not sure where exactly the line would be placed, but after reading a bit on the web, think possibly the underside of wrist/forearm likeliest place. Can I have IV in front of hand and arterial line on opposite side of same arm? Not sure why they don't want to use my non-surgical leg for BP during surgery. Also learned yesterday that they need 2 IV's in place for the surgery, but only 1 would be kept in for a day or two after surgery. I planned on having the 1 IV put in my hand (have had this done previously for almost a full day), but it is suggested to have the 2nd IV in jugular. After putting off the surgery for many years because of lymphedema I have gotten to a place where day to day living is rather difficult and quite limited because of the knee deterioration, but the thoughts of all those things stuck in my veins has me freaked out and considering cancelling surgery once again. I'd greatly appreciate any information on arterial and jugular lines, risks, etc. and also any concerns with lymphedema because of this. Dx 8/28/2000, IDC, Log in to post a reply",

After reading sbelizabeth's post, I was thinking maybe I misunderstood and they need a 2nd IV site to be selected ahead of time as a precaution, but jazziD did have 2 IV's in, so will need to check on that. I've read that sometimes a machine is used to filter drainage blood and then give back to the patient, so maybe that's why the additional IV? With prophylactic right mastectomy and no axillary nodes on that side, risk is probably low for lymphedema, but already dealing with it in my left arm, I know I definitely don't want it bilaterally and do everything I can to protect my right arm. Automatic BP machines seem to me to inflate quite high and measurements would need to be repeated frequently during surgery so BP on arm is not acceptable. While an IV and arterial line in the same hand/arm is a concern, always thought that restricting fluid flow with BP cuffs, tourniquets, etc was more of a risk factor than infection or trauma from a vein stick. I have blood drawn from my right hand without a tourniquet. Another thing in the back of my mind.....I've been by told there is no-way lymphedema can happen in the leg after TKR as there are no nodes in the knee and that any swelling is just from the trauma of the surgery and not actually lymphedema. But I have read that lymphedema can and has indeed happened after knee surgery. When day to day living and getting around is this difficult, not to mention extremely painful (knee alignment also affecting my back), guess it's time to move forward......be as informed as possible about the surgery, take necessary precautions, have a good and caring surgical team and most of all, trust in God that I'm in His hands.

The anesthesiologist decided to use blood pressure monitor on my left calf and BP was also monitored on calf for the 2 day hospital stay. Even though the calf BP measures higher than my normal, he was more concerned with it being consistent. They never inserted a second IV, so guess they just wanted to have a location ready in case the hand IV failed. I was not permitted to wear compression on my left arm during surgery, but have 2 Solaris extended gloves that I wore the rest of time in hospital and LE was controlled very well. Right hand IV also was fine with no issues. Because of calf pain few days after being discharged, I was sent for ultrasound - negative for clots. At 4 1/2 weeks out, pain continues not just in my knee, but also in foot, thigh, hip and especially right rear area (sit bone?) which is much worse than the knee pain. Have an upcoming appointment with chiropractor soon, so hopefully he can help with the lower back/rear/hip pain. Ortho said some of this pain is muscles learning to work with new knee. I wore compression TED knee high stockings everyday for 4 weeks (3 on non-operated leg). Without stockings, swelling has increased in my ankle and calf, but the knee and thigh area has lessened. Question: What advice or suggestions would you have to help with this swelling. I do try to elevate whenever I sit and I think this helps some, but is annoying. Thinking to try compression socks of some sort or maybe bandage wrapping. I'm pretty sure the swelling around knee is normal at this point, but in the ankle and even top of foot is more of a concern for me.",

My fitter who is also a bilateral just tried Amoena Tresia Personally Contact forms and absolutely loves them.  But just holding these forms in my hand, they seem so heavy!  I can't seem to find any weight listed on the box, but weighing them on a dial bathroom scale, I would estimate them to be about 1/2 pound each.  I do seem to like the idea of a contact form and would appreciate help and suggestions on this weight issue. Another issue is my really large dog ears, so I'd also appreciate tips on what contact forms might work with this.  Seems to me that the lightest possible forms would pull less on the extra tissue?

Didn't you have your Tribute cut into 2 pieces?  Is this the same one?  When I take off my Tribute in the morning, I have the channel marks up to my elbow.  The top half of my sleeve is pretty loose and worn out now and I don't remember if it ever made marks all the way up even when new.  I never would have described my Tribute as being \"tight\", more just poofy and slightly snug.  Jennifer, you have the gauntlet type hand piece and you've worn the altered Tribute for just 3 nights?  I'd be suspicious that it is too tight and trapping fluid somehow.  Can you have your measurements rechecked and send the Tribute back to Solaris?  ",

I've decided to go with pull up loops although both my therapist who does the measurements and Solaris think my problem is that the sleeve is too loose.  From my forearm up, measurements are now 2 to 3 cm smaller and that plus the worn out condition would make it slip down. Last time I ordered the sleeve in black and found the material rather stiff and scratchy, so when they needed to remake it with  a sewn in thumb like the Caresia and Tribute gloves, I asked them to make it in teal and it was great......nice and soft.  Maybe it was just that particular dye lot for the black, but this order will be for royal blue.  I had to pay out of pocket for my last Tribute, but did get the insurance company to reimburse the full cost minus shipping.  Now there is a supplier in my area that deals directly with my insurance company, so I'm to fax the order forms to them and they'll handle it from there.  Makes me a tad nervous doing it that way, but the supplier seem to understand all my concerns and I can still contact Solaris if I have a question or problem.

From what I've found since my surgery, thin women usually get better results.  Heavier women who already have tissue excesses will still have excesses after mastectomy, especially more around the side.  And the breast being gone makes those excesses look larger.  But that doesn't explain leftover skin flaps or dog ears.   ",

The surgeon wants 2 IV's in - with the 2nd just in case of trouble or failure with the 1st during surgery and this is standard procedure for their orthopedics department. Normally one would be in each arm, but in my case only one arm can be used (and that reluctantly on my part) so the other \"in case\" IV will go in the jugular vein. One will be removed immediately after surgery - I'm assuming it will be the jugular IV. The arterial line is to monitor blood pressure since I do not want the automatic thing on my right arm during surgery. Thoughts of the arterial line I must admit does scare me, but having lympedema already in one arm, I'll do everything in my power to prevent it in the other. Epidural does definitely sound like the way to go. They sometimes also use a peripheral nerve block, but pretty sure I'll pass on that. Looking forward to a fully functional and pain free knee! Wouldn't you know it, that a couple days ago my left knee,usually much less troublesome, has greatly increased pain now.",

I went in for surgery yesterday to have the excess tissue yesterday left from my bilats in 2008 removed.  It was planned to have the IV in my foot since I have LE in my left hand and the surgeon, short stay staff and anesthesia department were all aware of the plan and assured me it would not be a problem as it had been done there previously.  So after 2 unsuccessful tries in my left foot when they couldn't get the cannula in, my surgeon came in and tried another spot on the same foot.  The first 2 were quite painful, but the surgeon's attempt less so, even thought he worked at it longer, but still no success with the cannula.  Next the anesthesiologist came in, had me hang my feet over the side of the bed and tried a vein on the other foot also without success - guess the veins in my feet are just too small.  So at that point the feet were out and I could cancel surgery, have the IV put in hand of my prophy side (no axillary nodes removed except one from within the tail area of the breast) or go over to the hospital side instead of short stay part of the facility and have the IV inserted in my neck.  Well I really didn't want the neck IV and so began to weigh the pros and cons.  I have been terribly uncomfortable with the excess tissue, especially that under my arm prophy side and often had nerve kind of pain that would radiate around to my back  Even my arm sometimes seemed to get sore or painful from the very big bulge, maybe because of the way my arm had to hang out away from my body.  The anesthesiologist said she would put in the smallest line possible in my hand as they wouldn't have to use it much and would take it out as soon as I was able to drink liquids.  I think it was a 22? and was in for maybe 3 hours tops.  So I've been doing some hand pumps and elevation, not sure if there's anything else I can do for right now except hope and pray!  On a positive note, even though I'm quite sore today, I already feel more comfortable without that hunk under my arm and am enjoying not having those 2 pointed ears sticking out from the front of my chest.  The hospital staff was great with my LE concerns - put bright pink LIMB ALERT bands on each wrist, blood pressure monitor on calf, etc.  Also, maybe it's standard procedure with these type of surgeries, but the PS put me on Cephalexin to prevent infection especially due to previously radiated tissue and also becase of my LE.   Dratted LE anyway!  Let's all pray for not only solutions to live with it, but an actual cure!

I've never really looked into gauntlets before as initial swelling was on the top of my hand and then moved into my fingers, so I needed full gloves.  But now it would be really nice to sometimes just wear a gauntlet and have totally free fingers!  Maybe I'm way off base here - I know from reading other posts that sleeves should be worn with a gauntlet (or glove), but maybe once you've had swelling in your hand and fingers a gauntlet as prevention is never useful?

My BS told me that the pathologist really wouldn't even \"size\" the DCIS in my right breast because it was so wide spread, more areas than the imaging showed.  It was in the path report that they found the microinvasion 2.5mm. When I had the bilat mast.  I also started recon with tissue expanders.  By having both breasts done at the same time I will be able to have better symetry and less worry. I am now meeting with an oncologist on 12/22, to discuss the next phase of treatment.  BS said that it will most likely be chemo. Meet with the PS today, and fortunately was told that recon will still continue even when I am going through chemo.  Yea!  Funny how little things like that are considered good news nowadays.   Oh, FYI- all of this was found during my annual mammogram.  No lump.  Just-Sher",

But yesterday I headed to my local craft store and purchased a few items to get me started - A Knifty Knitter loom (round medium) and some bulky yarn as well as a couple of small bookmark cross stitch projects.  I worked with the loom last night and quite enjoyed it, but I'll also probably have to modify the hook tool to make it more comfortable for my arthritic right hand.  I didn't buy a separate hook, just used the one that came with the loom, so not sure if you can buy different ones like you can crochet hooks, etc. Maybe it wasn't so much the hook, but the fact that I was looping the pegs rather tightly (I crochet tight too) and so it was harder to take the loops off to complete the stitch. Afterwards, I read LindaLou's post on the rag quilting and watched a couple of those videos.  This will definitely be something I'll want to try as well. The tote bags would make great gifts and could be customized and stuffed with all sorts of items.  I used to be a pretty good seamstress, even once made a floor length A-line gown with matching floor length 3/4 sleeve coat.  Time to use my machine for something other than mending. I've crocheted all sorts of things like garments, stuffed toys, afghans and decorations using a variety of yarn, but the last several years have only using thread for smaller projects of doilies, Christmas ornaments, dishcloths, etc.  When I started getting arthritis, smaller items with less bulk was easier on my hands.   So, thanks again and Happy Crafting!",

I finally took the plunge and bought a CompreSleeve and I really was hoping to love it like Jane does, but not so.  For me I have a tough time getting it on correctly, not being as flexible as I should be to tighten the velcro at the upper outside (or backside) of my arm.  I think I would rather have the adjustments where they could be reached more comfortably from the front.  Another thing I don't care for is the way the extended or angled top just sticks straight up in the air not doing anything.  There is no way to tighten the sleeve past the axilla and unless I hold my arm in a certain position, that upper part doesn't even come in contact with the top of my arm.  The very cute model wearing the CompreSleeve, also is wearing a black top or vest, so you can't actually see the top of the CompreSleeve and how it fits against the arm. The material and padding of the CompreSleeve is quite comfy and doesn't feel terribly huge.  If not for the adjustment issues, I think it would be pretty comfortable to sleep in.  I'm going to try it once more, but at this point will likely return the CompreSleeve and continue nightly bandaging for now.   ",
