I told him I wanted to start dating him and he refused but wouldn't say why. Well, I know why.  We all know why.  No one wants to get their heart broken by falling in love with someone who's going to die.  I even tried dating a man who had no arms thinking he'd understand the body issues.  But the \"living\" issues way outweighed the body issues and he ran too. I wish there was a dating club just for stage IV men and women.  Companionship is so necessary to living I think. Maybe I'll Google \"Stage IV Dating Club\" and see what pops up. I don't mean to bring you down Rinneron.  I just really hate this disease and how it strips us of everything that's meaningful. I know.  Not everything.  But I'm ranting now, too. {{{HUGS}}} Teri",

She said pink tinged or white mucous. Now I'm so worried again. I have a doctor appointment this morning for a stress echo to see if my heart is the reason I'm having such a hard time breathing. I'm going to keep the appointment but I have a feeling that my heart is not going to be the reason. When I emailed my rad onc yesterday I asked her what the percentage of success was for the rads to have worked on that tumor that was bleeding.  She said more than 70% success.  That sounded good last night.  Now I'm thinking it wasn't so good after all. Has anyone else had problems with their lung mets bleeding?  If so, please let me know the outcome or at least the treatments you went through because right now I don't see much in the way of available treatments.

That is a long time indeed. What did that fight looked like for you? I was originally diagnosed with DCIS while serving in the Peace Corps in Costa Rica. My doctor recommended surgery, then chemo, then rads. I decided on chemo, then surgery and no rads.So I started out with A-C-T which was standard at the time.After I did chemo I had my bilateral mastectomies. I liked that I did that because when they did the original lumpectomy, the margins were dirty but when they did the mastectomies, the margins were clear.That told me that the chemo had obviously worked!Yay!!! 9 years later\u2026dummm-da-dummm-dummm\u2026Stage III, back in my chest wall, then 3 years later Stage IV in my lungs and here I am with all of you fine people!  2. Before you \"retired\" what kind of jobs did you have? I know that cancer cost you your last two positions, but I don't know what you did in your professional life. I was an accountant in my previous life.I had just earned my CMA which is like a CPA but instead of Certified Public Accountant it stands for Certified Management Accountant. I worked really hard and was being groomed for a Vice President of Finance job when \u201cCorporate\u201d found out about my cancer and pulled the rug out from under me.  3. Your online portfolio of artwork is quite breath-taking. Do you have any formal training as a visual artist or are you self-taught? What are your artistic inspirations? How did you find your studio partner? I am a self-taught artist but my body of work entails hundreds of paintings.The problem is it\u2019s expensive to get them digitized to put on the web site so that people can buy prints of them.So I hardly have anything up.After I \u201cgo\u201d my brother is going to hold a charity auction or something. I told him just not to give the proceeds to Komen. My studio partner, Sherrill, is my best friend of 38 years. She has turned out to be quite the artist too!  4. I haven't travelled around Oregon much. Just driven some of the coastline and gone to a conference in Portland. Can you tell us about Estacada, OR? Is is a rural area? Small towns? Is it flat or hilly? Can you see mountains or the ocean? Estacada is a very small town at the edge of the foothills of Mt Hood. The reason I moved out here was because it was the only place I could afford to buy acreage and I had just bought a horse off the race track that the owners were going to kill because he couldn\u2019t race anymore. It\u2019s a very cute little town and I fell in love with it right away. It\u2019s on the Clackamas River which gets a lot of drunk and idiotic recreationers in the summer months.But in the winter I get lots of beautiful snow because I live \u201cup river\u201d from the town at 1,200\u2019 elevation.So if you\u2019ve been to Portland on a clear day, you\u2019ve seen Mt. Hood and so you can sort of see me. (And maybe Deuce would be staring back at you from some bushes up here too!)  5. And finally, all of Deuce's fans want to know, how did you come to live with so many animals? How much land do you have to house them? Did you get a herd of goats or did you add them one by one? Did you milk them and make cheese or did they just wander about enjoying their lives? A few years after I moved up here my best friend\u2019s cousin decided to move to Alaska and needed a home for his 2 female goats.They were Pepper and Casey (now deceased). I have 4 acres so plenty of room. I loved having goats so much I decided to breed the two girls so I got Jet and Martha out of Pepper, and I got Domino, Deuce, and Sunday (now deceased) out of Casey.And a farm was born. No milking \u2013 just loving.  6. Bonus question: Please tell us how you chose your screen name. For the first month, I envisioned short pants, but I bet there is something more in your choice than I imagine. My friends used to call me Goat-Woman.Capri is the latin root for goat.To be capricious is to act silly like a goat. Capricorn is the sign of the goat, etc.Then I just added something that sounded female on the end: -ness.Capriness. ",

But then, I had forgotten this since there's no way to enter it in to the treatment section of BCO, I did a trial. My side effects were, once again, unbearable and I swore NEVER AGAIN! So this year my doctor tried a targeted therapy on me telling me it wasn't chemo. Afinitor.  The mouth ulcers and rash and zits all over my body made me realize it doesn't have to be called chemo.  My reason for not wanting chemo was so I could have a good QOL at the end. The point I want to make for this thread is that I made that decision back when I was still relatively healthy (of mind anyway).  Human nature makes us afraid of dying.  I knew if I waited until the doctor said, \"Take this or you won't live another year,\" I would panic and take whatever he told me to.  If you've read my other post about this topic you'll recall that I did the same thing with my decision to have bilateral mastectomies. The surgeon gave me an out while we were in the operating suite but I said that although I was terrified of doing it, I had made the decision back when I was more mentally stable and I was going to stick with the decision. So far I haven't regretted any decision I've made over the years when I follow this principle. I wish you all luck when making your decisions. Teri",
