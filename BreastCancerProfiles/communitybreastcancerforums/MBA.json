    "Content": "MBA wrote: Hey everyone- I recently went to my Gyn. with slight breast pains (both sides- on and off). He took a 30 second look and feel and said he felt fibrocystic thickening in both breasts. He ordered a mammogram and ultrasound- this Thursday. I forgot mention that both armpits are swollen and \"burn\". When I called back, neither he or the nurse were sure about it. Has anyone experienced these symptoms before? I am 36 with no other breast issues. Log in to post a reply",
