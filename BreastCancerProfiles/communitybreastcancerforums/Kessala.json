From Christmas of 2005 and every Christmas since then I've wondered if this will be the last one. Every year I wonder if it's worth the effort to put up all our decorations. Three years ago I inherited an artificial Christmas tree from my parents so now we display two full-size trees in our house. Instead of thinking it's the last Christmas, I find I'm adding even MORE to our celebrations! I'm sure a time will come when I don't feel up to going through the effort of decorating. But not yet. It took me a few days to get all the Christmas items unpacked and displayed but it's so worth it. The decorations make me smile. I can still manage to make this house look like Santa threw up in it.

When I found out I'd be taking hormonals, not lose my hair and would appear absolutely healthy I decided not to tell anyone else! My parents had health issues of their own to deal with.  Hubby and I live hundreds of miles from our families.  Our communication is typically via telephone or email.  Family and friends are unaware of my numerous medical appointments.  No one knew I was hospitalized overnight when I had a mastectomy. To this day no one other than medical people and my husband knows I have cancer, much less that I'm terminal.  And I love it!  What a relief to not have anyone fawning over me, talking about me behind my back, emailing me \"cures\" they discovered on the Internet, constantly asking how I'm doing.  No one treats me any differently than they ever have because I appear as my normal self. I've been on my first chemotherapy, Xeloda, for almost two years now so I've lost no hair and no one is any the wiser.  My intention is to keep my secret until there comes a time when I don't feel as well and it's becoming obvious something is wrong with me.  I've always been a very private person.  Handling my diagnosis this way is perfect for me.

My December, 2014 PET/CT scan showed increase in two areas of bone mets so I'm back to getting Xgeva every six weeks now.  I've never experienced side effects from Xgeva.  I did have flu-like symptoms from my initial Zometa infusion and occasional knee pain in the few days following Zometa.  I've been living with bone mets for just over 9 years and I'm doing well.  I guess all that bone strengthening is helping despite my worries.

Yes, Krazy Glue!  Hubby has deep finger cracks every winter and the only thing that helps is to coat them with layers of Krazy Glue.  The product doesn't bother your skin, the pain is immediately relieved, no stinging.  Of course the layer of glue wears off within a day or two.  I simply re-apply as needed.  Krazy Glue works SO MUCH better than New-Skin Liquid Bandage (which we've also tried).  It may be worth a try, especially if you've had to resort to using finger cots.    Kessala",

My most recent PET scan was done last week. NEVER in all that time have I EVER been told I shouldn't walk into the clinic from my car or be wheeled into the Imaging Department via wheelchair! That's so silly it's laughable! By requesting you not to exercise during the 24 hours prior to your PET scan they mean don't go to the gym, don't run a race, don't overdo vacuuming or floor scrubbing. Live your normal life, walk your dog down the block and back, prepare supper for your other family members, clean up the kitchen afterwards. But to skip the walk from the parking lot and be wheeled into the scanning room is such nonsense. I'd love to have been given those instructions by a well-meaning but obviously new medical worker. I would have laughed in their face! Other than the over-zealous instructions you've been given I think you'll find having a PET scan is mostly boring. I usually doze off before the scan and during the scan. You won't feel sick, the radioactive glucose injection doesn't make you feel any different. It's an easy-peasy procedure. It certainly doesn't require you to act like a mannequin prior to the scan. Kessala",

I was on Zometa for a total of 6 years.  I had it monthly for a couple years and then four times per year for four years.  I refused the scanning Oncologist recommended.  I figured no symptoms, no pain, so why scan? Six years later I had the world's worst backache out of the clear blue.  I had to be scanned.  The bone mets were now in my entire spine.  The backache was due to two broken vertebra due to mets. I was then switched to Xgeva and was getting it monthly.  I was on monthly Xgeva for a couple more years.  Due to reading about side effects (femur fractures) I asked Oncologist if I could back off on getting Xgeva so often.  She let me back off to every 12 weeks. At my very next scan two areas of bone mets showed new activity.  Oncologist immediately changed my Xgeva injections to every 6 weeks and that's what I'm currently doing. I've been receiving bone strengthening infusions or injections for almost 10 years, sometimes as often as every month and sometimes as little as four times per year.  No one knows what to expect as a result of getting these medications for so many years.  There is no data that I'm aware of. However, the fact my bone mets showed new growth when we backed off the Xgeva it scared Oncologist into giving it to me more often. Kessala",

I told him the older I get and the longer I live with cancer I feel less and less like I have to spare anyone's feelings. I was wondering if you reported the nurse's words to a superior and then read that you had. And that superior gave a totally unsatisfactory answer. Interesting the nurse is no longer working at your clinic. Hmmmm, I wonder why? (said sarcastically). You weren't the only patient who complained about her \"honesty\". Remember we are paying customers in this \"game\". Doctors and nurses and support staff work for us. Speak up if someone acts like a jerk.

I didn't like the book, found nothing \"hilarious\" about it. Typically I find if a book is described as hilarious or laugh-out-loud funny I never find that to be true. What I didn't like about the story was that Ove is a widower. He spends his days thinking about his late wife, living inside his head and repeatedly trying to commit suicide. As a Stage IV breast cancer patient all I could think was is this how my husband will be after I'm gone? Disengaged from the world and always looking for a way out of this life? As a 65 year old woman I was also stunned that the author considered Ove, a man in his 50s, as an old curmudgeon! From my prospective someone who is considered a curmudgeon is probably in their 80s! Obviously this is an opinion from someone with a terminal illness and who, in her mid-60s, doesn't think 50s is curmudgeon territory. I love the idea of being part of a book club though. This first book just didn't float my boat. Kessala",
