I am super glad to hear that your oncologist said the same thing as mine in reguard to not removing the tumor. I also wanted it gone! But we are treating it instead. I am hoping that your upcoming scan is tumor free and you can go back to your NED status!!!!! I am ER+/PR+ her2- so our treatment is different. Please keep us updated with your scan....I will be thinking of you!!! Blessings, Michelle:)",

My oncology team felt like a FNB was not a good way to go for me. The risks outweighed the benefits. The surgeon and radiologist felt like the PET was conclusive for BC mets and the risk of spread and hurting the kidneys were not worth the risk initially. They wanted to start treating me and see if it responded to treatment. If not, they would biopsy. It did initially to the AI meds but I could not tolerate them so now we are starting IV chemo again on May 10th. Going to do that for 6 months and hopefully with no spread, be in remission, and then have the adrenal removed. So we shall see....I am praying that I don't lose my hair:) I just got it back!!

My oncologist took me off Femera because it was raising my blood pressure and making it where I could not walk:( So I am not on anything right now. Taking a million supplements and hoping for the best. I just got done reading, What your doctor's not telling you about Breast Cancer\" by Dr. John Lee and it was really interesting....started taking natural progesterone and hope to feel better soon.

At first we tried AI's like Femara and Arimidex but the side effects were so bad. The tumor did shrink some while on those but I have since started Abraxane IV chemo. I have not been scanned since starting so I am not sure where I stand. As far as the function of the glands, I am not sure about that either. We have not talked about it. My oncologist is hopeful that this chemo will wipe it out and then have the adrenal gland removed in 6 months. We have not discussed radiation, probably since I have just started IV chemo treatment. It is really rare and I am my oncologist only patient that he has had that breast cancer has mets to adrenals first without going anywhere else. Even taking it out is rare even for adrenal cancer. So I understand the lack of information. Please keep us updated and I will as well with this new treatment!!! Blessings to you and your English is wonderful:):) Michelle aka Duchess of tea:)",

Well, a year went by and no mets anywhere else and after treatment during that year of hormone therapy and IV chemo ( which did absolutely nothing), I did not have any additional cancer spread. But last December the tumor started growing rapidly and became the size of the my adrenal gland in a matter of weeks and I had to get my adrenal gland removed. I chose not to have a biopsy as all of the doctors and surgeons felt like it couldn't be anything but BC mets. The surgeon felt like it was to high risk to have it biopsied and so I didn't. When they took the tumor out it was confirmed as the same cancer that I had originally. I am getting scanned again in a couple of weeks but I am doing great. Femara worked really well for me and actually did better that abraxane chemotherapy. I am not on any new treatments as they all make me ill and as long as I am doing well with no new mets, I am just going to enjoy life. I am taking one Femara a week. I just cannot take it anymore than that as my joints have just taken a severe toll from it. My cancer was different from you, Nel, as I am ER/PR+ HER2-. So our treatment protocols are not the same. I would look into all options, Stilts. I have felt so great since getting my adrenal gland out....I wish I would have done it sooner....",
