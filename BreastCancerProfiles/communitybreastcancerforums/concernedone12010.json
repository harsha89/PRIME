My primary care looked at it at my annual physical while doing my breast exam.  She said it didn't look like anything and seemed to be a skin issue---mammogram was clear.  Since it didn't seem to get any worse, I simply forgot about it--except for the spells I would have when I got all worried and convinced I had breast cancer. After  year, would I be having more symptoms of IBC, if that is what was causing the redness or wht could be causing the redness? I worry about my health constantly......Last month I was convinced there was something wrong with my heart, had an ER visit and a 2 day hospital stay for test, all the blood and heart tests--everything normal...just my worrying.  For the last week I have been having a mild pain in the arm pit and rib cage area when I raise my arm..it honestly feels muscular but I am starting to freak myself out about it being breast cancer that has spread....I know the simple thing would be to go back to the doctor but I have somewhat of a doctor phobia...I am just a mess!
