In terms of side effects, this a first for me. Everything I read pertains to what to eat in these cases, but how do I stop the pain? It's terrible! Thanks in advance to anyone who can help.",

I haven\u2019t created my signature line yet, but I\u2019m ER+, HER2- Stage IIIb with 22 nodes. In the midst of this all, it\u2019s comforting to know that I do not have to be alone on this journey. My best wishes to everyone.",

Bad pain. I took something for heartburn and that helped. My throat was better too, but I don\u2019t know if one had to do with the other. My husband got me some ice cream that helped too, thankfully. @wanderweg, Congratulations! That must be a great relief. My last one will be the day before Thanksgiving, so for the first time ever, I\u2019m not looking forward to Thanksgiving, but that\u2019s okay because I\u2019m still grateful. And I\u2019m very grateful for all of you and this community.",
