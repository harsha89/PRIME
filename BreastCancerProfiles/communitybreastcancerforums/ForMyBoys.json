The cancer side had many more issues after surgery and was told not to move my shoulders until my seromas subsided. I was cleared on Wed to start my exercises, so hopefully I will quickly be loose enough to start rads. I am to have 25 doses.  They do not want me using any cream at all unless I develop a problem and then they want me to only use what they prescribe...but I am not sure if I will comply with this. I am just now able to massage cream into my scars and it is helping my wounds heal and range of motion. I don't think I will stop.. ",

BUT, my tumor was originally 4.9 cm x 4.9 cm (7.5 including irregular margins) and was less than 1 cm from my chest wall. So the team highly recommended radiation. I went with it since I am only 46 and a single mom of 2 boys. They said my age was a factor in their recommendation. Another deciing factor for me was that if it came back, I coulnd't use much of the red devil again because of the lifetime limit. ",

They told me to expect it to get worse this week and it has. It is only under my arm. Turned cooked hamburger gray, then the blistering started. Where the cancer was is barely red. I am going to refuse the last 3. So I guess I am done too, but I don't really feel like celebrating. I had shingles during chemo and they wouldn't let me sit in the waiting rooms for fear I would contaminate other cancer patients with chicken pox. I even had to get my chemo in an isolation room.",
