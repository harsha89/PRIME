Have a really good Oncol now and she arranged to do her own tests. and really understands that I actually dont rust anyone anymore. she even arranged for me to have a special test on my live, by a brilliat man really nice patient and expalined everything to me and said that the liver masstassis was actually a shadow being thrown from calcification from another area and that I did not have liver masstassis. even though I could see what he was saying i still feel a bit lost and not totally confident. also I have to ask myself well were is this calcification shadow coming from. yes there is always a fear that the cancer will return that is what happens with cancer anyway this is to try and let people know be your own advocate i feel you have to with this love all x Log in to post a reply",
