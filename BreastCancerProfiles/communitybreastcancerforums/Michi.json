Tired of being this high strung. Doesn\u2019t help that two friends and my step mother have been diagnosed with cancer this past year, which threw me into this whole spiral of anxiety.

Thankfully I have loads of help (it takes a village!) i\u2019ve definitely felt guilty though, and let\u2019s just say we have walked up to the ice cream shop way too often due to mommy guilt! Lol The fills are awful, and honestly I felt very sore for 4 to 5 days after each Fill, thankfully my next one isn\u2019t until July 11 and likely will be the last..I\u2019m up to 520 now and I\u2019m happy where I\u2019m at. I feel really heavy right now on my pec muscles so I can\u2019t imagine being able to handle much more.. Oddly I find myself totally fine during the day, even walked about 6 miles this afternoon, but I am very sore every morning when I wake up, and it\u2019s really painful to pull myself out of bed.. I havent ask my PS about it but I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s because my pec muscles are sitting all night with the stupid tissue expanders on them and are just tight in the morning. Once I stretch and have a warm shower I feel better, but today is the first day I haven\u2019t taken any Advil in the morning. Anyone else waking up with this kinda pain? I know it has to be the tissue expanders because it literally feels like giant rocks sitting on muscle, which is exactly what it is since mine are under the muscle. I\u2019ve also wondered if I have been overdoing it during the day, I\u2019m the type of person who cannot sit still so I literally go crazy sitting on my couch and trying to relax. I find when I keep myself busy I forget the rocks are there. At the same time my surgeon warned me this would happen and not to push myself too soon. Did you guys get clearance at 6 weeks to lift over 10 lbs again and start back to light excercise? I saw a couple people on another forum were running again at 6 weeks?!

She doesn\u2019t have a fantastic/super friendly bedside manner, she\u2019s more to the point, and I\u2019m more of a chit chatter, so I feel like I know ya type. But a dear friend of mine who is an oncologist pointed out to me that I don\u2019t want a girlfriend to hang out with on the weekends, I want a plastic surgeon and a surgeon who have done this a million times and know what they\u2019re doing in the operating room. Dr Colewell does tons of reconstruction, it\u2019s her primary practice, and that is key in finding a good PS. I can\u2019t speak to the final product yet, as my exchange isn\u2019t until September, but I\u2019ve been pleased with the process thus far and if she can make my implants look even as good as my TE\u2019s do, then I\u2019ll be pleased.

I'm 3.5 weeks out and I noticed today there is an area on my SNB side that is super tender, though in all honesty i have been poking at it since I noticed that! Also, since I've been cleared to do my post surgery excercises which include lifting my arms overhead I just assumed I no longer have any restrictions in that department, but I didn't really ask. I'm sticking (reluctantly) with the no lifting thing but other than that I'm business as usual.. didn't anyones surgeon tell them otherwise?",

She explained she wouldn't need much fat since the fat she puts in there needs a blood supply and my foobs won't be able to handle much and \u201csurvive\". She said this would be the most painful part of the exchange and I would be bruised and sore for a week. Scar will be very small, 1 cm ish. Naturally, I asked her to suck all the fat out of me and just dispose of the rest or donate it.

I almost had a heart attack, \"um no, not at all mentally prepared to go under the cut again\" Told her I had weekend plans. They seem very casual about all of it, so I am hoping this is an indication of how easy the surgery will be! lol (Wishful thinking?) Talked to a friend this morning 12 days post her mastectomy and she is miserable. I told her to hang in there and at the 4 week mark things get better. Makes me think of how far we have all come. My incision site on my right side has been itching like crazy. Yesterday I wore a bra too tight and it all started then. It's totally healed so I have to assume its just the nerves, but has anyone else had this itching business? I've been loading up on the lotion which has seemed to calm it, and I'm free-bra-ing it today to try and avoid further irritation. Post exchange I plan on using a silicon based scar gel, as I was told these are the best for minimizing.

It was so bad that I would have to flip sides every hour at night because it was like two rocks into my sides, in the exact position. Don\u2019t worry though, January will be here before you know it. I\u2019m adjusting to my new implants just fine, but I think honestly anything would have been better than the tissue expanders. I think mine were so painful towards the end because they overfilled them and instead of doing the smart thing and asking them to take out some fluid I just endured the pain for the last two months. I will say I am bruised all over horribly from the fat grafting, I look like I\u2019ve been beaten pretty severely on my flank area and the top of my breast where she injected the fat I have horrible bruising also..so odd I didn\u2019t bruise at all with the first surgery but this one, though much less invasive and I am black and blue all over. I spoke with my friend today who is four weeks out and due to her radiation schedule she won\u2019t be cleared to have the exchange surgery until next July, I guess she has to wait seven months minimum after she finishes radiation before she can think about the surgery.

I cannot tell you how much better I felt starting yesterday, which was the one week mark. I\u2019ve managed to get completely off the pain meds because I actually think they were making me feel worse, and even though my surgeon did not advise me to do any exercises yet I am doing some very mild light stretching because it\u2019s helping with the pain. I wondered if anyone was having pain in their ribs and attributing this to the drains? Every time I try and lay somewhat flat in my bed for example, my ribs hurt either on one side or another. kind a hard to tell if it\u2019s from the incisions or drain sites. So, still in recliner and looks like I will be until drains come out. I hate sleeping in the recliner and I am dreaming of the day when I can sleep on my side or stomach again, wishful thinking I know. Glad to hear everyone\u2019s doing well and for those presurgery or just out, everyday has gotten easier. Sending love and healing vibes to all.",

He really disappointed me and we had a long conversation about it just last week and I told him exactly how I felt in an effort for us to move forward.

I\u2019m the maid of honor in the wedding so unfortunately I can\u2019t miss it and the next available time my surgeon had was mid October, so hoping it\u2019s easy on me. Everyone has assured me the exchange is a piece of cake in comparison. But let\u2019s see. I\u2019m betting you won\u2019t have as much pain as I had with my two fills since you previously had air to stretch you out. I\u2019m no longer in any pain so to speak, (other than first thing in the morning) but they certainly feel heavy still, so that might be a new feeling for you. Ljm- my surgeon has a three month rule for doing an exchange surgery but she said that only has to do with putting me under general twice unnecessarily in less than three months, and nothing to do with the expanders..I actually tried to get her to do the exchange at the start of August so I would have more time to heal for this wedding and she adamantly refused, even when I offered to sign a waiver about the anesthesia. She said it\u2019s purely since in her opinion it\u2019s hard on the body. she did mention some other surgeons do the exchange as soon as 8 weeks after and it depends on their practice policy. ",

Dr. Smith was a referral from my oncologist friend in Kansas City, she has been extremely caring and wonderful so I\u2019ve really appreciated that. However, dr Colewell was pretty short with me, and her bedside manner certainly didn\u2019t give me a warm and fuzzy feeling. I felt like I had to chase her down discuss pre-operative details, even at that I wasn\u2019t speaking to the doctor herself rather her nurses which kind of annoyed me, but at the same time I understand she is very busy. looking back I realized partially this was my fault because I came to my appointment extremely unprepared. I didn\u2019t ask the questions I should have and ultimately she explained what she was going to do to me in perfect detail. What my oncologist friend pointed out is that I\u2019m not looking for a best friend, I\u2019m looking for the best surgeon with loads of experience because that\u2019s all that matters in the operating room where I will be asleep. (Not chatting about our interest) My oncologist friend said she was shocked to find most patients of hers choose their doctors because they get a good feeling, and in her medically minded brain she thought this was absurd and people should only be choosing doctors based on their skill set and experience. At the start of this week I had a lot of anxiety about whether I was making the right decision, because we as human beings need to feel like, in addition to having the best doctor, we also click with them. At the same time I think it\u2019s important to understand every doctor has a different personality, but at the end of the day if you are comfortable with their surgical skills that is what is going to matter. I also consulted at Beth Israel, with a wonderful team of doctors who spent hours with me and I felt extremely comfortable with. It was a difficult decision to make but ultimately I felt my surgical oncologist I am choosing had more experience so I went with her, even though I felt a tad more comfortable with the plastic surgeon from BI. I felt it was important to choose two doctors who have worked together before and are comfortable working on the same team, while I wish I had that warm and fuzzy feeling with both Drs I do feel comfortable that I will be in good hands, and ultimately that\u2019s what matters. We are fortunate we live in Boston and have the option to choose from an array of amazing doctors and cancer centers, wishing you the best of luck with everything but I did want to share my experience to give you some perspective.",

Borogirl- I ate fresh pineapple the week leading up and right after. According to a friends mom whose had two MX ( one on each side two years apart) pineapple made all the difference in her healing and allowed her to get her drains out two weeks sooner. I thought, why not? I love it anyways, especially fresh. I had no bruising and drains came out eight days post, had to keep the other two in until the following week because of my doctors protocol (only takes two at a time) but they were all ready. I was shocked at the lack of bruising because my skin will literally bruise if you tap it because I\u2019m so pale I\u2019m nearly blue. No joke. So, maybe there is something to it after all.

So just to give you guys hope and some peace of mind for the exchanges. Now starts the healing again, will keep you guys posted. Dr went with 650 mL natrelle insprira cohesive gel. She also did some fat grafting from my hips, which she says will be the most painful part. Dr. wants me back on the gabapentin for a week as well as Oxi as needed, and of course an antibiotic. The lovely surprise was that I came home drain free, which shocked me because the nurse told me I would be going home with drains for at least a week.

I\u2019m also having my first fill Monday so I\u2019m nervous about that. I already feel better getting two of the drains out, and I swear my ribs hurt less. Thinking a drain was positioned on top of my left rib. Ready about, I\u2019m having some swelling under my armpit on the SNB side as well, looks and feels a bit funny and swollen. Not like a hematoma but like my armpit fat ishanging over and swollen. If that makes sense? Anyone else having this? Wondering if it\u2019s normal swelling or if PT will help.",

Faithsmama- I have never smoked in my life and previously disliked it very much when I tried in college. However, I live in Boston where it\u2019s legal and my hubby enjoys it from time to time. I ditched the pain pills early and started using a vaporizer (vape?) not sure what it\u2019s called but it\u2019s not like smoking. It\u2019s more clean and you don\u2019t feel/taste the smoke which is what I always hated. He got me some medical grade CBD oil. It\u2019s been so helpful with my anxiety, pain and massively helped me sleep. You should look into it, it\u2019s natural and obviously much better for you long-term than having to stay on painkillers. This is a ringing endorsement considering I was very anti-smoking for so long. My husband now teases me all the time because I used to rag on him so much when he would smoke ;",

These tissue expanders feel like rocks sitting on my muscles anytime I lay down in bed, or with certain movements. Technically they are hard plastic backs that touch the muscle, so not far off from rocks. If you\u2019re still having that much pain daily talk to your dr and see if they can try a different muscle relaxer or even some nerve pain med, perhaps that will make a difference? It\u2019s still pretty early post surgery, I\u2019m told at the 6 week mark things but get drastically better and the TE\u2019s will feel more comfortable. (I\u2019ll believe that when I see it) Blessed- I have the same pain and weird sensations. I\u2019m also freezing all the time. I was literally shivering and chilling the first couple weeks post surgery and was freaking out I had some infection. Then I realized I was literally just super cold. I\u2019ve always ran on the cold side but now it\u2019s another level. When I drink anything cold I literally feel it go down my chest. I\u2019m told this is normal since there is no longer the layer of natural breast tissue. I\u2019m hoping when I get my real implants I\u2019ll warm up! It\u2019s summer in Boston and my husband jokes in winter he\u2019s going to stuff my bra with glove warmers like the skiers use!😂 SN- The PA is the one that told me I could start, only when I asked her at my first fill..I\u2019m thinking they tell people to start based on how they are feeling at her office, versus having a policy for certain number of weeks. It\u2019s interesting yours is so strict, I wonder when he will have you start the exercises.. I\u2019m accustomed to toting around a 4 and 2 year old (plus a hefty French bulldog). I haven\u2019t lifted on the kiddos but I am sure I\u2019ve been lifting over 5 pounds from time to time. I have to remind myself to take it easy!",

(Pain wise) though I\u2019ll preface that with-I went cold turkey on the pain pills for the filling process other than an occasional Advil. The fill itself is easy, it\u2019s the aftermath of stretching that is awful for me. Also I started at 400 and have had two 60 cc fills. Likely I\u2019m done. Had my second Monday and just feeling some relief today finally after 30 minutes of stretching exercises. The second was much harder than the first, leading me to believe the bigger you go then more you feel them. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but aren\u2019t to you planning to go smaller? this may work in your favor pain wise. Also, I started with saline, so I have no idea how having air effects further fills and perhaps that will also work in your favor. Honestly this could just be me, I\u2019ve read several other ladies post who said they had no issues with f",

Her little hand out she sent me home with said something crazy like 12 weeks before I could lift 30 lbs (daughter is around 27 lbs). I\u2019m going to pretend I didn\u2019t see that hand out and go with 6 weeks because it\u2019s killing me not to be able to lift her and I feel healed enough to do so. I assume the lifting restrictions have more to do with ripping incisions anyways, but maybe there\u2019s more to it? I\u2019d be curious what everyone elses said as well.",

Ps- I\u2019ve got several Crunchy hippie friends Who swear by fresh pineapple for healing purposes and to fight infection..,though I don\u2019t always buy into it I ate it religiously before my surgery and feel like I healed pretty well 🤷🏻♀️ Maybe worth a shot? BAZelda and One of 7, big believer in sleep is the best medicine also. I have several friends not battling cancer but who have other issues with anxiety and depression and swear by Xanax, I think especially during a time like this it can be helpful so you can be more present for day to day and more relaxed during treatment It\u2019s not something you need to commit to long-term but I kind of feel like it\u2019s there when you need it and maybe worth a shot to get through a really difficult time.",
