Then saw a vascular Dr and she wants an ultrasound tomorrow. Might be a blockage. We'll see. Not wearing the sleeve until we know. Still having trouble getting my blood numbers up and staying up. Have very few problems with A+A, and feel good. Is there any drug better than Afinitor to keep us going? Oral meds are so easy and less exhausting, at least for me.",

I've talked openly about it with friends and family, so they understand!  I will fight this horrible disease until I can't fight anymore, then I'll go into the after life screaming 'what a ride'.  Thank you Erma Bombeck for this quote.  It's my favorite!",
