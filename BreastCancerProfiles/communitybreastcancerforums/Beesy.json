I read stories of large tumors melting away and it gave me great hope. Large tumors are often high grade (aggressive) and they generally respond to treatment. Note I posted just a few entries above, and in August when I was diagnosed, I could never imagine feeling as well as I do today. You're still in the worst part where there's no plan. It sounds ridiculous, but it really does get better.",

There is a woman on this site by the great name of Lottanodes, who had 22 positive nodes out of 23! This was in 1995 and she had the same chemo regimen as my mother did. She is alive and well! What I'm trying to say is that it's easy to be horrified by our bad numbers--believe me, I know. For now your job is to tell your doctor you'd like to start chemo immediately--I told my doctor I wanted chemo yesterday! My doctor got tired of me telling him that, so he finally started sooner than planned, and they made it happen within an hour! I would say the hardest part of being a cancer patient was advocating for myself. If you need a pushy, hard-to-stop person there with you to help you, by all means ask a friend to help you. If you happen to live in Houston, I'd go with you and drive your oncologist crazy too. I'm serious!",

My daughter is an avid knitter and has knitted me every conceivable size of knocker and I'm just getting to the point where I'm half way comfortable wearing a bra for long periods because my nerves and incision lines have finally calmed down. To answer your question, yes I go to the store, etc., without my foobs but generally wear them if/when I know I'll see people I know, though I suspect it will be harder in the summer when I'm not wearing jackets. This has backfired on me a few times, running into friends unexpectedly! Haven't started wearing silicone yet, but it's not like I haven't before, because I had a Phyllodes tumor removed in 1997 along with half my breast (you are only the second person I've \"met\" who's had one they are so rare). So before my diagnosis in August, I'd worn a silicone prosthetic for 22 years because otherwise the difference between the boobs was very noticeable. I'd had enough prosthetics break down on the outside that I knew I did not want silicone on the inside and I was not a candidate for DIEP (though I did not ever really consider it). I am very happy with my amount of surgery, the ease of my recovery and I'm looking forward to living life! I bought something called a Seamless Microbead Form but I ended up buying the wrong size, so I returned it--but I plan to re-order because I think it will be much more comfortable day to day than wearing silicone and cooler than either silicone or the knitted knockers. They are so light--barely weigh anything! These microbead forms are available widely and might be a good option for you.",

While I'd always said \"how can feel a lump in a bunch of lumps?,\" it popped right out at me. It grew from the size of peanut to the size of pretty good sized lime in a matter of months. The needle biopsy missed the area with the phyllodes tumor in it, so we took it out thinking that it was just a giant fibroadenoma, and my surgeon then (who just did my BMX--how's that for being a repeat customer?) suggested we take it out because it could or would take over my entire breast, as you mention happened with yours. Yours was three POUNDS? After they took out mine, the pathology came back with phyllodes and they went back in for roughly half the breast. I had young children at the time, my mother was in treatment for B.C. and I had a very close friend with inflammatory. Both my mother and friend are alive and well today, but I'm sure that influenced my lack of grief over losing ½ a breast. So since that incident, I've always been very B.C. aware, but I did make a mistake leaving the cancer center after ten years, believing I was wasting their time and I could be checked through my PCP's office. I was having regular mammograms (3D ones) but I had very dense breasts and I should have been insisting on ultrasounds every time. This should have been found earlier. So all this to say, in a funny way, having gone through it before prepared me for the loss of breasts (knew I'd want both off without reconstruction--for me, being symmetrical mattered, and it's not like I hadn't experienced asymmetry for 22 years). For me, I chose the right amount of surgery. I was back to real life in a week and a half or two. I don't want to sound like losing one or two breasts is \"no big deal.\" But I have to think that my prior experience did help in some funny sense. I'm not sure I have answered your questions, but I will send along the link to the microbead prosthetic I ordered: https://curediva.com/collections/breast-forms/products/seamless-microbead-form The name of it is ABC 929 Seamless Microbead Form. If you google it, you'll see it's available everywhere, but the link above is a good price. I saw some other microbead forms in a prosthetic store here in the Houston area, and they were heavy or made noise when I touched them. These above did not but were nice and light. Knitted knockers are working okay with me, especially now during radiation, but I'm having trouble getting the size right. My daughter's made me every conceivable size and I've taken stuffing out, etc, but can't get it \"just right.\" I read someone (and come to think of it, it may have been you, months ago) mention putting a smooth stone in the knitted knocker. I've got to try that, because as I learned when I first lost half a boob, you don't realize that your boobs hold your bra down until you don't have two. It's a much bigger problem now, and some of its because I'm not wearing my regular size bra--but I definitely don't like things too tight right now. A smooth stone might just do the trick!",

You should ask your docs, but I would say the amount of movement to wash your hair would be good for you.

At the time of surgery, I did not have a stick of hair on my entire body and my plastic surgeons (for neat closure, not reconstruction) insisted that I take a shower daily, even with my two drains! I even argued, saying I'd rather not, but they said it's good to wash germs off the area of the incisions. I did not do it as often as they would have liked, but followed their instructions otherwise. One unrelated thing: when you meet with the anesthesiologist, make sure to request a nerve block (there's one you go home with and one that's more like incisions during surgery and both last for 3-5 days). I had the latter type of nerve block and I took very little pain medicine because of it and probably was the reason I felt comfortable moving as I did.",

My incisions are already healed, so much so that I've already started radiation. I requested a plastic surgeon to close me to prevent dog ears and make the incisions as neat as possible. Are you familiar with dog ears? I have a friend who has two from a BMX and it affects the clothes she can wear and just bother her. Her surgeon also did an abysmal job on her incision lines. I think he was convinced she would change her mind and have reconstruction done (so if you're sure you won't change your mind, be specific with your surgeon that you want a clean line). I could send you photos of what dog ears look like, the photos I showed my plastic surgeon as examples of what I did not want. For what it's worth, even though I had a plastic surgeon close me, I do have two prominences on either side--even though my surgeon said I was too thin to have a real problem with dog ears. The PS did a very neat job, and for that I'm grateful. I do not know whether these prominences will become smaller over time or not--I suspect they will improve some. Your doctor can give you an Rx for prosthetics and bras. Most insurance will pay for a certain number of each and stores specializing in post-surgery garments and prosthetics deal with the insurance company for you. Soft prosthetics like \"knitted knockers\" are all you can wear early on--you're just too sensitive in that area, especially the nerves (or at least I was). Land's End makes great mastectomy bathing suits; I've worn one for years because of my earlier brush with breast surgery. I think in my case, having lost ½ a breast in 1997 made me more able to deal with a BMX/no reconstruction. After surgery, my best piece of advice is stretch your arms as much as your doctor will allow. I regained my full range of motion quickly. My friend who had a BMX had to go to PT and still never regained her full range of motion.",
