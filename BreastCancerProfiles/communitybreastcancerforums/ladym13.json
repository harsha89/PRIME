I also notice that my hair at the front where the wig was taped is a lot thinner than the rest, so perhaps it does prevent the hair from growing...but not sure I could just be thinner there.

I also use the Nioxin, shampoo, conditioner and follicle booster, however I have always used it even before treatment and I truly believe that it makes a world of difference. I finished Chemo on June 30th and I now have almost an inch of hair, it's growing really even and just as it was before, I SOO can't wait to be able to style it a little. Quick question and sorry if it's been answered already, I want to start taking the Biotin, but I just started tamoxafin, is there any problems with taking the Biotin when I'm on the Tamox? Also MBJ- did you notice that the biotin helps with weightloss? I heard that somewhere..just curious. Hope everyone had a great weekend Mo :)",

My stylist always blowdrys my hair stretching it and then finishes with the flat iron. I get it done once or twice a week and it lasts me, I find it VERY hard to do myself because it's SO thick and curly. I also STILL use nioxin, I have used it before I was diagnosed, used it throughout treatment (even cleaned my bald head with it) and I still use it now, I swear by it, I LOVE nioxin and the way it makes my hair look.",
