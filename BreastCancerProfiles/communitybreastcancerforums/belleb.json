Since my diagnosis at the beginning of January I have maintained the same idea - that I wanted a BMX with no recon, but you're right, people tend to be taken aback by that choice when you are younger (I'm 35, BRCA neg). I've also heard the \"well, you can always reconstruct later\", but I honestly don't think I will ever want to. Despite my own feelings not having wavered, I feel like I'm maybe missing something that everyone else sees?? I'm hoping that once the final decision is set in stone and the surgery date is set I will feel less anxious about this, and it really helps to see someone else in a similar position feeling the same way I am :)",

My surgery was on a Friday morning and I stayed one night in the hospital and was released Saturday morning. The first couple of weeks weren't much fun, but not because of pain - there was very little of that. Mostly it was just tightness and soreness and the frustration of not being able to lift anything or raise my arms much. Once the drains came out (around day 10) I started to feel much better and I really turned a corner between weeks 2 and 3. I highly recommend asking your surgeon about some exercises to start doing when you get home so you can regain your range of motion easily. Oh, and I got one of those full body pregnancy pillows to sleep on and it was a lifesaver! The one I got was called a Snoogle. Best money I spent!",

I will say it was uncomfortable for the first 5 days or so. Not painful, I was just very aware that there was something implanted in my chest. It took my a while to be able to turn my head completely, even swallowing felt a little funny - and now that I read Sam's description, I'm reminded that I had some chest discomfort too. Day 5+ though everything was on its way back to normal, and now, 6 weeks out, I don't even think about it being there. I am SO glad to have it though when I see the other patients in the chemo room with their IVs and picc lines. With the magic of EMLA cream, I feel not even an iota of sensation when the needle goes in and it's a quick poke, no searching for veins, etc....  Meg - my BS also had me leaning towards rads after my lumpectomy, but I just can't fathom not doing everything I can to keep this beast from coming back. My own MO told me yesterday that most oncologists would avoid radiation if they could and that she would likely do the same thing as I am thinking (bilateral mast.). So, having conflicting opinions from two doctors who you really respect makes things even more difficult! I know that the general consensus these days is that lumpectomy w/rads and mastectomy have the same survival rates, but I'm having a harder time finding data on RECURRENCE rates. Anyone have any good studies to share on that info?",

I'm getting really anxious about it - mostly the not knowing what to expect. And the nausea. Please GOD spare me the nausea!  My regimen will be 4 doses of A/C (over 8 weeks) - each dose followed by a Neulasta shot the following day. Then it will be 12 weekly doses of Taxol with no Neulasta. I had my ECG this week and it was normal, but some of the stuff I have read about the Adriamycin scares me! I also had a CT scan and bone scan done last week (at my request - surgeon said he usually doesn't unless lymph nodes are involved, but would order them if it was what I wanted) and those came back normal as well.  Everyone who sees my port says \"oh you're gonna love that\" (as if you can actually LOVE something implanted in your body whose sole purpose is to administer you poison lol). Looking forward to spending some time with you ladies despite the circumstances!",

Then the nurse came in with the Adriamycin in a huge syringe and manually pushed that through the port. That didn't take long - maybe 10-15 mins? Then she hung the Cytoxan bag and that took an hour.

The fact that it's major surgery, though, is weighing heavy on me too. I'm only 35, I want to give myself the best chance of never having to go through this again! Has anyone else been really gripped by \"chemo brain\"? I paid bills today and it took me three times as long as usual because I kept making errors. I try to read a book and I absorb none of it. I feel like a complete idiot! I even can hear myself having conversations with others and think \"I sound drunk!\" lol",

There's a lot going on in our brains right now in addition to all the physical junk, so it makes sense that our tolerance for BS would be low. I had my one week post infusion appt this morning and my blood counts were \"perfect\" so on to round 2 on Monday, Feb 10. My mouth is all irritated and it hurts to swallow, but other than that I feel pretty decent today. Hoping I can have some normalcy this week before I have to do it all again next week.",

I don't know what my #s have been, as I haven't asked - all I've gotten is \"bloodwork looks good, chemo is a go\", so no specifics. I felt a bit more comfortable with going out when I was on A/C since I was getting the Neulasta shot, but with the Taxol since it's weekly, no Neulasta so I'm scared it's leaving me more vulnerable. I can't stay cooped up in this house, though! Getting out and about does so much for my mental health that I would be miserable if I couldn't do it.",

I am so excited to say that most of my clothes are totally still wearable! I found these little Coobie imitation bras at Forever 21 that have the little \"modesty liners\" in them and then took some of the fiberfill from my Amoena surgical cami \"puffs\" and stuck just enough in the bra to not allow the liners to go concave. It's perfect! It gives me just enough of a bump that I look very, very small chested instead of surgically flat. I am so happy about this I could cry   Anyway, healing is going pretty well.

I don't wear prostheses, and instead choose to go flat or wear a little bralette with some fiberfill behind the modesty pads (just so they don't go concave). I find I can wear a LOT of clothes I previously assumed I could not. It's amazing what a camisole can do! My advice is to wait until you are fairly well healed before weeding the clothes out of your closet - you may very well be surprised at what you will still be able to wear afterwards :) Immediately after surgery I had a few button up soft pajama sets that I lived in for a couple of weeks. I took the pockets that came with my post-mastectomy camisole and pinned them to the insides of the pajama tops to hold the drains. I couldn't handle the actual mastectomy cami - it was so uncomfortable. After a couple of weeks when I could safely raise my hands above my head I wore anything I wanted. Good luck to you!!",

At that point they told me after chemo I would need either radiation on the affected breast or a mastectomy. From the very early days when I was lost and emotional to present day, when I have grown so much stronger, I have always felt I wanted to do not just a mastectomy but a bilateral mastectomy with no recon. I've had friends react weirdly, friends who high five me with a \"you go, girl\", friends who have begged me to reconsider, but deep down in my gut THIS is what I feel is best for me. The thought of radiation leaves me uncomfortable and the more frequent mammos I would likely face for the rest of my life adds even more radiation. I want to do this the least complicated way and not unnecessarily make my life more painful, more difficult and harder for my family to live with. I have two young kids who I don't want to spend anymore time looking or acting sick for. So, my two cents would be to go with your gut! Best of luck with this decision!",
