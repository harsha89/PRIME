Had a lumpectomy and mammosite radiation x10 in November/December.   I just had port surgery today and will start my first of 4 rounds of AC chemo tomorrow.  I have hung around this site since my DX and have learned so much.  Although things seems to have moved very fast, the worst part is waiting for the chemo and not know what to expect since everyone's case is difference.  Please pray with me and I will pray for you as we take this journey together.",
