Chemo fatigue was longer in duration, stronger, and predicable. I knew I was going to be out of commission for four straight days non stop after each chemo Rad fatigue is unpredictable and daily. Today, I ran a simple errand after rad. Got in my car when it came. Luckily driving distance was only a few miles from home. I exercise everyday but I need a nap daily. Here is my suggestion if you choose to work during rads. Get some sort of cooler to carry organic aloe gel (no alcohol) and about 3 or 4 good size gauze pads. Throughout any day, pour aloe over the gauze. Dab all over rad area. You need to air dry for few seconds. If cool aloe gel is not possible, you just pour aloe in travel size container and carry in your pocket book, Cool aloe gel dabbing 4 times w nightly Eucerin plaster at night has been my routine for me and my skin is holding good so far.

Third one whom I saw on Jan 20 17 was the one. Got the surgery I wanted on 02/15/17. In My case it was worth seeing three surgeons even with varying degree of capabilities. You will get a bigger and better picture re how to handle this possible storm. I also strongly recommend be nice to yourself as well as making your daily life comfortable. This could include getting anti depressant scripts from your GP. It may even be a little of retail therapy. Mimi  P.S. My intially recommended surgeon told me to wait two weeks min that was not acceptable for me whatsoever. If you think you need you need more help, please PM me",

Lets get thru the surgery first because it is the first strike againt this bleeping disease and believe me you will feel a huge relief. 2nd strike aka additonal insurance aginst this bleep is chemo. Your paragraph likely means 4 dose dense chemos every two weeks followed by 12 weekly chemos. In total 20 weeks(4×2=8 plus 12 wks) Side effects vary and there are many ways to counteract those. Chemo sucks no doubt. I did 8 dose dense chemos. Lost weight (gained all back after treatments) lost all hair( my chemo curl is incredibly beautiful) there is neither side effect or after effect for me at this time. I had temporary neuropathy for 2 mos after final chemo. But remember you have one choice to make which is staying alive. Breathe. You will get thru the surgery and more. PM if you would like.",

In terms of difficulty, no node zapping does not make noticeable  difference. Also, shorter # of  trips to radiation is better because  fatigue may make it  it harder  to drive to rad place.   Don't mean to scare you but there is such thing called bolus which gets wrapped around side of your torso below the arm.  If you get it, ask it to be cold instead of the usually warmed  when they put it on you.  after 9 tries of bolus,  techs and I realized cold bolus is a lot better.   mimi ",

I forget the name (chemo brain I even was going to walk out of supermarket this morning wo paying) she said she started slathering 100% Aloe gel a few days before radiation. Found it under radiation section topic share inspiring messages her screen name is Gulfwater. Her skin only got pink and dry. It makes total sense. My RO gave me sample of Aquaphor already. I am going to put reminder on my phone to start slathering Mimi",

I looked at her lymphedema sleeve and recognized what it was for the first time. Turned out she was hit w triple negative 19 yrs ago when she was 32. She had 18 mo old when she had chemo.She is part Korean like me. I felt somewhat of sisterhood because of that, She told me that she could not change dirty diapers even when her baby sat on her face asking to be changed. I am simply awestruck and delighted to meet a long time BC survivor, Mimi",

Used up entire tube of silicone cream. Thank god RO has unlimited supply. I feel my skin got sensitive overall. Went for PT. Even though this is for something else, any PT when you have probabilty of stiffening from rads is good. Speaking of which, I should do some exercises PT gave me. Mimi",

Third is green tea.  Aquaphor is good but very hard to remove residue from my finger tips.   I thought of buying miaderm but I am going to see how Eucerin holds up.   I have some fluid build up due to lymphedema (4/19 pos nodes). Panicked a bit in the beginning about not being able to use Flexitouch pump. Had to refresh MLD.  Can't wait to use the pump again.  I live in central FL and this heat is outrageous.  I have been walking  early mornings before my zapping sessions. So far 30 or 40  min per day  has helped.  One more thing, the first few sessions I  was so tense holding on to the bars above my head.  Wearing some sort of fabric gloves helped (I wore compression  gauntlet in both hands)  I  finally started relaxing my hands.

I felt my arm is a lot lighter when I got up this morning. Still just aloe gel dabbing only. Light scabbing in the area. Reddishness slowly fading along w nerve pain. The general heat disappeared quite a bit. Going to enjoy a peaceful day before the next round of drs appts start. Darg it I do have an appt come to think of it, Mimi",

Dang it I am spending too much money on this BC thing. I have to orrder more aloe gel. It feels a lot better but healing curve is a lot slower than I would like.

I threw omg I can't spell the entire kitchen sink as form of DMX, 8DD chemo, 30 rads. I am about to throw more since I am scheduled for prophylactic total hyst. I had a very humble experience a few days ago. Me and my hubby stopped by at this guy's house. He is the only son of DHs late step father. I did hear he had stage IV cancer a few yrs ago I say about 5 at least. He was a big burly guy last time I met. He was skinny. He said he lost 40%of his body weight at his lowest. He looks about at least 25% lighter than his prev weight now. He told me that he had a big jar of morphine for a while. He lost good percentage of jaw bone. Still works a lot of hrs. Yes he has a very good job as an engineer but still living w cancer aint easy at all. Maintains a beautiful house. His youngest daughter is about 20 so I think he will make sure to live another 10 yrs to see the daughter get married. Another example is one of my co-worker who is about in his early 60s. He went home early bc he did not feel good. He tried work from home but his wife found him in front of his laptop. He had a heart attack. This case it amazed me he passed away at home instead of on his way home. Yea and there is my mother for whom I bought no question asked funeral expense life insurance 20 plus yrs ago. The surgeon told 6 mos to a yr. She was DXd w BC about 10 yrs ago. Still alive and kicking. She is about half of what she was before Ovarian and BC. Honestly, I believe only our maker decides when it is time for us and lets us know.  ",

About appetite, it will be nonexistent mainly due to painkillers. I would get variety of groceries. This way if one does not appeal to you go w next one. Painkillers also give constipation so earlier you can reduce it the better. Appetite comes back within 12 hrs after reduction. About pain killers, you will be given some strong stuff. Take every time because most intense pain lasts about 72hrs after surgery. Also take any painkiller refill offer. Any additional painkillers will come in handy for later surgery you have planned. I heard some drs or hospitals give only extra strength Tylenols these days due to opioid crisis. Wish you speedy recovery Mimi",

Yea my underarm was raw from rad. Rawness peaked for a week right after completion. Last rad was 09/14. All effects from rads are gone except trace of greyish brownish skin in radiated area. Yea I am hoping I never have to shave radiated right armpit. After two weeks, I even felt sudden drop of general swelling. Lastly, I do remember not moisturizing for about 24 hrs after rad completion again I was busy w drs appt. This helped scabbing raw underarm. This was 1 wk to 10 days post rads. You will know when the entire sore spots scab. Moisturized as little as possible for the secod week. Someone said it took her two weeks after rad completion. It seems no matter what everyone's DX is, rad healing takes about two weeks.   ",

My left side was saved due to 1 cm margin and no pos node. Done w 30 rads. 5 of 30 were boosts. Tattos are more like teeny tiny dots the techs plant. No anethesia needed.If you have nodes removed you may feel tad bit sensitive around tattos. Mapping/simulation could take more than an hr. Actual Zapping sessions are very short. I spent 1 hr round trip to get 5 min on the table. Walked min 2 miles every day. The big thing for me was fatigue coming over suddenly. But then again I had min two appts every day.Skin reaction wise every one is diff. I had very faint pinkishness half way. When it was done. My area was definitely pink. No blister or raw spots. But as soon as done, two small blisters appeared on one at a time. And my underarm was raw. It took about 10 days for heat, raw spots scabbed to disappear. Everyone uses diff moisturizer. I only used refridgerated aloe gel. Golden rule is no top as much as possible. Or loose top as possible. You have to let the heat out which you get from radiation. The entire 30 sessions were hot and annoying.  General difficulty curve for me was Definitely manageable to half way. After half way things get rough. Right after first boost, it took another level for worse. Second thru last boosts were real smooth and breezy After completion my body probably got angry at me by acting up two notches. After two wks, every thing calmed down. I even felt swelling dropping drastically. Lastly, even though many people say radiation facilities are the same. No I begged to differ. I searched facitilies near home..Turned out there was a brand new chemo rad place by work. The place had newest and greatest machine. I was fortunate enough to see the techs fussing over 2mm being off. ",

My body only showed fade pinkish lines at half and bearable fatigue. Fared quite well all and all bc I had a few crucial long wknds for the second half. Exactly 15 sessions out of 30, on Friday. The fancy rad machine broke down. I was at the lobby of rad place when I got the call. I was able to hear machine sound. I was busy running errand so I went home. #21 fell on Labor day. Another long wknd #26 was MO appt also fell on Hurricane Irna. Another long wknd. #27 was Hurricane outtage also. Very long wknd. One more silly information is after you are done w rads. Problem is you need about 2 more wks to heal post rads. Your body knows no more rads so it will act up more. The last step is to make rad scars be scabbed. If you can handle, dont put any lotion for about 12 hrs.After you see scabbing, moisturize every 12 hrs. Or when you feel dry scab pain. I think I did that on day 9 post rads.  ",

Me 47 did 4DD AC did 2 out of 4 DD Taxol w/o any break. 2 more to go for me. #1 AC was OK I even walked for about 45 min on Day2. Day3 and 4 were Neulasta Days. Took tylenol and Claritin like recommended still hard. Used ton of icy hot roll on for the bone pain. By Day 5 afternoon I was 85%. Day8 and on I was like myself. #2 AC hit me by Day 2 afternoon and 3 and 4 were semi torture. During that time. I Got up drank Boosts. Took Tylenol, took Claritin halves( I hated Claritin SEs which ars more fatigue, headache and blurry vision. I take 1 half at 6 am and the other half at 6pm like clockwork) suffered torture till Day 5 late afternoon. #3 AC was a lot better mainly bc I found somewhat of relief in terms of Epsom Salt Scrub. Still did boost, claritin halves, Tylenol. Helped me to sleep better and my skin is perfectly moistiurized and exfoliated. #4 AC was the hardest probably bc by this time my body was screaming what the heck you are giving me all these toxins. Somewhere around #2 I did have heart palpitations. The palpitations are gone now. For me AC means My best friend Neulasta was glued to my body to torture me for 48 hrs. Day 3 and 4. Another thing is if you are crying from pain, you have to tell your Oncologist. I have a friend who was given morphine when she had DD AC. I cried non stop during my DD Taxol #1, I told my onco I cried non stop for the first week from pain. She had to prescribe low dose Hydrocodone. I did not cry for #2. Taxol. You can and will do.this Mimi ",

The thing helped me was I found Epsom Salt. It helps w muscle aches and pains. Magnesium sufate is good for your body. It moisturizes and exfololiates skin. Chemo drugs are likely to brown your hands and feet. My hands and feet are pink because I have been scrubbing w epsom salt scrub. Last hypothesis of mine is I never got to ice my hands but no sign of neuropathy. I think the salt helped in that regards.  Lastly, if you had lymph nodes removed, please check out flexitouch pump.

Taxol pain even lingered till a couple of days before next infusion while AC pain stopped on about day 5 or 6 the latest. Sorry you are caught w Taxol right now. I wish I can help you any way. I was in agony when I had taxol that I even came up w a song which goes something like \"two more visits to my onco two more pricks to my port eight more bad days then i will be deported i cAnnot wait at all\" You can say I was out of mind to make up lyrics. Glad you got to have a break to prep kiddos. And temporarily off of the toxin. Just thought of something. I used to take Ativan up to 1.5 mg a day. It knocked me out at night and helped me w anxiety. Anxiety caused chest pain for me. I also use Arnica gel sold by Boiron. It is whitish and light green tube. Publix has the very close second best price (Amazon is best but you have to buy multi pack or subscription) A bit pricey but it helped me sleep at night. As a last resort, I begged my family doc for pain killers. I know I sound crazy but opioid induced constipation offset diarrhea I had. Luckily for me I had some weight to lose. Lost more than 10% of my weight. If I remember correctly you are very petite. You have none to lose. I did BMX w 19 lymph nodes removal followed by 8DD chemo and slightly more than 1/3 way thru 30 rad sessions. Chemo by far is the most bleeping bleep of all. You will survive this bleep. Mimi",

The first one is about feb 2017 of  my 85 yr mom.   3AM on 03/20/1995   , mom told me to take her to local municipal hospital ER.  that evening, mom had emergency hysterectomy. The family was told max of yr for mom.  Mom received Medicaid chemo back then taxol was the only default option.  the second is circa 1990. even though  it is not the best picture, you can  clearly tell my mom literally was big. the third one was taken june of 1994. Ovarian bomb exploded on March 1995 so at this time. There probably was a bomb inside her counting. The fourth  was summer of 1997. I hope you can see the siginificant weight diff from 2nd and 3rd. Related information is my no good old man father was still a jackass back then enough he had to get hot meals while mom was battling cancer. And back then there was no hormone testing, so after chemo was completed, mom was given Premarin as HRT default option.  So about 2007, mom had a BC bomb  even though it only required lumpectomy and radiation.  Thank  god for Medicaid.  As everyone of us go thru this gruesome and oftentimes depressing battle, we have to ask ourselves again and again the same question \"Do I want to give up?\"  It is up to us to decide what kind of answer we want to give.  p.s. Mom's last wish is to be donated for medical research and  the family  is going to respect her last wish even tough it may not happen  soon.         ",

Been mammgramed since my 33rd Bday at a same place. 12/29/16 Mammo blew up on my face out of a clear blue sky. Stage 3A and 1A, 4 pos out of 19 removed. 5 tumors ranging from 7mm to 3.5 cm. Recon was not an option and highly unlikely it will happen. Turned 47 on official DX. 8DD chemos without a single delay(my last one was even 1 day earlier than was supposed to) Mom had ovarian and BC. 30 radiations done. As some of you know I have more related and recommended surgeries scheduled. Hence my new username. Was I scared? Yes I thought I was going to die and leave my DH behind. I was not going to give up period. I lost as much as 13% of my previous body weight despite good eating, I am still 10% lighter than what I was last Christmas. Was or am I blessed? No question whatsoever. DH drove me to every chemo. He does 95% of household chores. He travels a lot though. He was on a business trip for bad days after AC #3 and #4. My employer has been phenomenal enough that I still have my job Jan 2018 when I go back. I had phenomenal BS who cut me real good in terms of surgical margin which enabled no radiation on my left side. Have I changed? No doubt. I was and will be treated at five different hospitals. I found all of my doctors made all the appointments and drove myself all over town. Found how to pay for this BC thing. My DH did not see any of the medical bills. I even got paid /reimbursed $1,400.00 YTD for getting this bleeping disease. I read all fine prints in my health insurance docs. I got twice max pt sessions. I got lymphedema pump to use at home. I know now I can survive at least one nuclear war no problem. Do I think I wasted the entire 2017 especially that I am getting another major surgery? No, because I learned priceless lesson about life and most of all me! Whatever my future brings, I am ready.  ",

Let's start by saying BC patients w little children tend to be more motivated. For example, mom would want to fix children meals and snacks. She would try at least. The result is higher likelihood your wife would eat something when your daughter eats. GI issue wise, I found nutritional drinks such as boosts helpful. The Idea is what she puts in should be more than what she uses or loses. I did double mastectomy, life time dosage of 8 dose dense chemos w/o delay(the last one even came in one day early), 30 radiations. And elbow lump removal surgery followed by total hystrectomy all done over 10 calendar months. I tried to walk every day however long or short. Currently I walk 10000 steps per day.  There will be some really bad days for you as a caregiver. I say that because you won't know what to do when your wife has no energy and walks like a zombie. Make her comfortable as possible. It could be herbal tea or foot message or epsom salt scrub. Lots of trial and errors involved. My personal favorite is epsom salt scrub while listening to my favorite music. She cannot have enough sleep even if that means taking sleep aid such as Ativan. Yes, there is a light at the end of this tunnel and all three of you will come out of it. Remember giving up is not an option period. ",

Fatigue came as short bursts of  sudden sleepiness ( a few secs)   for first half.  For the second half, I needed a nap every day.   I have LE and felt swelling during rads.   I could not use my lymphedema pump so I panicked briefly.   Wearing sleeve at least  10  hrs per day instead of the usual 8 hrs helped quite a bit.

I have pictures of before and after which I look at as insipiration.   In my opinion losing weight during even after chemo is expected.  potential GI issue alone from all the medicines cannot leave your body alone.  please this is your fight alone. no one elses.       p.s.

I had to sleep 20 hrs a day by drugging myself during chemos. Even the rads which was the least of the devils used to make me fall asleep so suddenly. dose dense chemos are damned if you do bc they kick butt damned if you don't bc dose dense is necessay for higher stage younger patients. please do your best to help her to get all 8. I am glad I did. Beside sleep eating is crucial during chemo. If she has problem w putting food down, nutritional drinks such as Boost is worth a try. I lost about 13% of my pre chemo weight despite keeping food down. sending prayers ",

I know it is Holiday season but lets also schedule consultation w surgeon. When you make a surgeon consulation tell the office you are getting MRI. if possible get a second opinion. I know it is scary and upsetting. But try to keep yourself together. Let's find out what it is and you got to make a plan for yourself accordingly. I think your radiologist is being extra cautious first of all. my radiologist did not for 10 yrs plus (same rad doc all those yrs) If this turned out to be as serious it may sound. You will learn a ton in every way. Here are two different possible scenarios.. 1. Surgery first t first with clean margin which means breast removed has bad suckers surrounded by amount of healthy tissues. this is first attack. the second attack is chemo and the third is radiations. some do reconstruction w the main surgery. 2. the other scenario is chemo then surgery which is called neoadjuvant chemo. (chemo after surgery is adjuvant) the rationale behind chemo first is the possibilty of PCR (pathological complete response) PCR means chemo killing all the suckers. PCR does happen if not The second rationale is shrinking sucker cells which could mean less non cancerous cells removed to get clean margin. Breast reconstruction methods are so developed you have so many different routes to take. I hope I did not scare you. please ask around on this forum. feel free to PM also.  p.s. I had three consultations. first one was honest but not capable. second one was a BS artist. third one was capable in every way I felt it.   ",

About antinausea meds, it is good for nausea but SEs are constipation or diarrhea. Unfortunately you cannot win too much while chemo. I was fortunate enough to minimize nausea meds at home. I took the meds for 2days after 1st chemo. SE kicked in promptly and dropped 10 pounds before #2. Ativan is good for anxiety, heart palpitation and mild nausea. Part of chemo, I took up to 2mg per day w no issues. I was able to reduce it to .5 mg overnight wo any withdrawal affer chemo was done. The drowsiness made me sleep quite a bit. It was what I needed bc the ample sleep let my body heal thru chemo and all other meds such as Neulasta,  Stay strong you can and will do this,",

I use the machine daily usually right before I go to sleep. Best Massage ever. Combined w compression sleeve wear avg 8 hrs a day, my PT thinks my ALND arm may be smaller than SNB arm. 3. Depends on you health insurance, co pay may be minimal. Mine was zero. There is some chance I can get my SNB arm sleeve. I love it so much I am willing to pay up to $1,000.00 The cons are, 1.
