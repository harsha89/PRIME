BI-RAD 2. \"Findings: The breasts are extremely dense and this does limit the sensitivity of this study as masses could potentially be present and obscured by the very dense surrounding fibroglandular tissue. On the initial left cranial caudal view there was an area of asymmetry in the medial aspect of the breast. This did not persist on subsequent imaging and most like represents summation fibroglandular tissue. There are no dominant masses or suspicicious calcifications An ultrasound was done over the area of skin thickening and dimpling. No masses could be seen as only normal fibroglandular tissue was identified.\" I don't know what to do. I've read lots of posts from people here saying dimpling is a serious sign. My PCP thought nothing of it, said it was normal, but I got mammo and US w/in 24 hrs thanks to my awesome nurse. The radiologist, who runs the Breast Center at the teaching hospital here, said everything looked normal. What might be my next step? Do I try for an MRI? Get a different doctor to look at my breast and images? Wait? I really need guidance. I know I have to do what I think is best but right now I don't know what that is.

The radiologist came into the US room after the tech finished and told me he thinks everything is normal, but that I should check my breasts on a regular basis for any changes, and if anything does change, call for an appt.  This dimple seems so abnormal to me though. And the pain too. I've never had any pain like it before, and it doesn't seem to be related to my period at all. I am starting to suspect it is Mondor's, based on some of the images I've seen online. If the pain and dimple don't go away after a month, I am definitely going back.",

So should I choose to go that route, I will likely stay there. If I lived closer to Fayetteville I would certainly go to that place you linked. I used to live there, and my family still lives in that area. I think I have heard of Dr. Harms before. BSGI sound great, not sure if my ins. will cover it. Nearest one is in Plano Texas, probably less than 4 hours to drive there. Something to think about. Thanks again. This was really helpful. ",

      "Content": "Sep 21, 2012 07:12AM EineFrau wrote: Actually the place I got the mammo and US is a breast center. Would they have to do an MRI to see where to biopsy? I was feeling around last night and I noticed a spot under my breast that feels cord-like, and I can see it in the mirror. So I do think it is Mondor's. I just wish the doctor had considered it, especially when I told him about the pain being right below my breast, against my ribs. That with the dimpling I would think would tip him off. He is the head of the breast center at a teaching hospital after all. I had been uninsured due to preexisting conditions for five years until recently. Now I remember why I have lost faith in the medical community. A bad experience with a PCP and a breast specialist who isn't thorough or who just doesn't have the time.  At this point I'm just going to wait and see. If it's Mondor's it will just go away on it's own. So if it doesn't go away I will certainly do what is necessary. Thank you so much infobabe for your input. Getting to this point of feeling like it's going to be okay has been quite a trip. Thanks again. Take care.",
