All - I am looking for advice about wigs - real hair versus fake, any recommendations that you've heard period...I ordered one from a catalog a month or more ago, still has yet to arrive, worried about how it will look, really really wanted to be able to try it out before the hair loss comes....in case I need more alternatives...I know I still have some time but don't want this to be something that is hanging out there too long... My next two weekends before chemo - shopping for hats/scarves with my daughter who is 10 and wants to be involved and getting anything else I can think of in order before the day...spending quality time with my husband and kids...enjoying life as I keep reminding myself I need to do every day...one of the key things that has come from all of this for me is the reality that I need to slow down and ENJOY more...!  I am very thankful for everything that I've read thus far about individual experiences and so wish the very best for all of you....you all sound so strong and I hope that I can be that way as well once the chemo experience starts.  As I have heard from others, and as I felt before my surgery as well, I almost wish that it would hurry up and get here so that we could start the process of getting this done....  Julie from Flower Mound",

Husband wanted a long sexy hair wig in colors different from my own....hmmmm....so not what I am looking for now...daughter wanted long hair too....i live in texas and will be doing my chemo over the 100 degree plus days....  Advice to you all is - take a friend, sister, older daughter, etc - someone old enough to totally understand and not the man in your life....  Julie ",
