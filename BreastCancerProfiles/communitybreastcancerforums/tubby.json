The lab report says it is grade 2 stage 2 with the the sentinel node showing cancer cells.Am still waiting to see the oncologist to find out what happens next , believe I will have to have both chemo & radiotherapy but I know so little about what is going on aaargh !! Over here they do not seem to think that you need to know as much about what's happening & of course if you don't know you also don't know to ask the right questions. Oh & am 61 yrs old with asthma , high blood pressure & arthritis.Will this affect what chemo i can have? Log in to post a reply",

I was told when diagnosed that I would have to go to Christies a top cancer hospital, not pleased as it would mean me going on their bus leaving at 7.30 am & not returning until 6.00 pm at least.Couldn't go by car as husband needs that to go down to do my pony, poor man didn't sign up for stable duties really. Then was told by someone who had found it out that can go to North Staffs for treatment & this is only about 2omins away form where I live. My district nurse told me not to ask if I could but just tell them that this is what I am doing, worked a treat. Only problem now is getting an appointment to see the oncologist, am going to have to pester them or I'll get nowhere. There's no end to it aaaaarrgh !!!!!! edited for appalling spelling",
