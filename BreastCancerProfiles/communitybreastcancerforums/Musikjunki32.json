My surgeon\u2019s scheduler just called and wanted to schedule me for surgery on July 27th (two weeks after the intended surgery date) based on one of the surgeons having a schedule change. I\u2019m in a wedding on a cruise ship two weeks after the 27th. Is that enough time to heal? I know I won\u2019t be able to lift anything but I\u2019d be able to stand the ten mins during of certain ceremony and lounge a two then the pool. I\u2019m having a double mastectomy with tissue expanders placed. They\u2019re doing either diep orbimplants later (I think im leaning more towards diep because at only 30 I know I\u2019d have to change the implants a couple of times Log in to post a reply",
