I am so glad that I read whatever I set my eyes on with regards to my situation. I am 100% estrogen positive (diag may 2010, biopsy, lumpectomy and radiotherapy (19) multiple tumours under 1mm + dcis) After 2 years of Zoladex and tamoxifen (age 43) with these test results I am so scared to rely only on the meds. I am booked for hysterectomy on 1/3/2012, an then I will change to Aromasin. Doc wasnt 100% in agreement he told me to continue with Zoladex and Tamoxifen for another year but said that it wasnt a medical mistake to opt for surgery. I look at it from the point of view that my kids I've had, More kids I cant' have (because of meds), although there is the possibility of falling pregnant, and why when its crystal clear that these meds will be long term for me (menopause, who knows when it will occur) should I be subjected to the adverse reactions of long term meds. I want to know that I am doing all that is out there to prevent recurrence. I am not very comfortable with the \"do this for a little while and we'll see\". It is dangerous for me to have a cycle, period. Therefore I will stop them.",
