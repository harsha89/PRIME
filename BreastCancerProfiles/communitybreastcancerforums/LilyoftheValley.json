I want to talk to all of the women in my neighborhood (there are 5, not including my mother in law) who are currently going through treatment or have gone through it recently what they wish they knew before that first mammogram after finding lumps. I feel though that that would be disrespectful, as if I've already diagnosed myself, or I'm putting the horse before the cart. Their suffering is real, and I don't want to make light of it in any way. What do I do if this lump isn't seen on the mammogram or the US? What do I do if they say they want to watch it for a while? That terrifies me. If I were not a sane person, I would have attempted to cut this thing out of my body myself by now. And what of the fact that in one neighborhood, there are so many women who have suffered from or are suffering from BC? 2 have have died. My MILs was caught early enough through a routine mammogram. A woman 2 houses down has battled it twice. I have so many questions. I don't want to have to wait to find out anything. I don't want my husband to have to worry. I don't want to stay up all night staring at the ceiling playing the what if game, while periodically checking this stupid lump to see if it's gone, gotten smaller, gotten bigger, gained some friends, and so on. I feel guilty worrying. So... What would you all tell someone going in for the first time with a lump other than... Don't stress (that ship has sailed), and ask to look at the films?

I was never a self checker until I met him and learned of her story and battle. We have only been married for 4 years. I found a lump slightly larger than the tip of my pinky this past week. I already had an appointment scheduled with my GP for something else, so I decided I would talk to him about it then. It was the longest 2 days. I expected to hear that it was nothing to be worried about like I hear all the time. Instead, the shock in his voice as he said Wow, not once, but twice, sent my nerves into hyper drive. I am now waiting for my appointment for a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound on Friday. I am obsessing over the lump. I keep checking it, hoping to find that it's gone away. I feel like I've been invaded by a little alien. I feel like my husband doesn't deserve to go through the stress of the wait again. I feel guilty that I told him I found the lump in the first place. I know the statistics of the 80% of lumps are benign, but that's not bringing me any comfort. I just want to cry and scream and sleep and so many emotions right now. My daughter says I just need to stop stressing about it, but how do I do that? I anticipate the next 5 days to go by slowly and then the wait for those results will begin. Log in to post a reply",
