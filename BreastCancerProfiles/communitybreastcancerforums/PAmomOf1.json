I am 24 years old and I have had a lump in my right breast for a while now but was too \"busy\" to get it checked out. It became quite painful about a week ago and so I made an appt. with my regular doctor. My appt. was yesterday and she too felt the lump. Her facial expression when she felt it scared me as she seemed very concerned. She ordered me to have an ultrasound STAT and within 20 mins I was at the lab having it done. She called me yesterday and said that the ultrasound did not pick up the lump but she wasn't surprised because I have dense breast (I was blessed lol). Anyhoo she wants me to see a breast surgeon and my appt is Oct 24th that was the earliest I could be seen. I know that cysts are painful as well but I have this gut wrenching feeling that its cancer. I just can't shake this feeling. It feels like a bee sting constantly. The skin where the lump is is ALOT thinner than the rest of my breast skin...Is this a concern? My right breast has always been ALOT bigger then my left (very noticeable) but I have noticed over the passed month or so that its got bigger. Im just looking fo honest answers..Did any of you ladies have these same symptoms and it turned out to be breast cancer? cysts? Thanks Katherine Log in to post a reply",
