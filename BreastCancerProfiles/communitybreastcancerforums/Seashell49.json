Chessiegirl - Hope you feel better soon!  Bummer you're sick in the middle of the rad. Does anyone know the name of a deodarant that is illuminum free? My Dr. says I can only use the lotion they give me when they feel I need it.  I would like to do some preventative moisturising tho and not wait 'til it's too bad.  Any lotions you would recommend that I could sneak on in the eve? Thanks to all!! ~Sue",

I agree!  I still have all of my blue ink marks, and they want me to keep those as they are easier to work with.  It was kind of a wierd week honestly, walking into an Oncology Radiology clinic each day to be radiated for cancer.  Some days I still cannot believe it's me with BC doing this??  At any rate, the people who do my treatments are really nice and it goes so quick.  I am in and out of the office in 20 min. or so.  And... 1 of the 3 grumpy receptionists actually smiled on Fri.  I'm making progress!?  My Dr. gave me a lotion called Biofine (I think...) Has anyone used this?  I did get some Aquafor but I agree... it's pretty thick. Candy,  You go right ahead and be a crybaby!!  You deserve to be!  What a bummer you have to go 2 1/2 hours and spend the whole week in Galv. getting your treatments and doing rads and chemo at the same time!?  At least I am glad you don't have to cook and clean... you do not need to do anything else!!  I will say extra prayers for you now that I know your circumstances.  You are amazingly strong!!  How many weeks will you go for rad/chemo before surgery?  (Tamox is short for Tamoxifen... a pill I will be taking to \"recept\" my estrogen/progesteren hormones.  My cancer was positive to both of these)  Doe, I am so thankful your  Colonoscopy came back ok!!!!!  Wonderful news!!!!  I am also thankful the situation with the insurance co. was corrected!!  The last thing you need is to worry about the $ with all the other stuff you have going on!? Blessme,  We all understand how you feel.  Finding out you have Breast Cancer changes your life totally.  1 minute you feel like yourself... the next you're like... why me??  So many worries and doctor appointments etc.!  Keep your good faith...God is amazing!!  :)   Trish,  what does it mean when your skin is breaking up?  Are you in terrible pain??  I'm sorry to hear this!!  2 bra tips:  someone on this board mentioned a bra by Warner's.  I found them at Kohls and they do not have underwires/tags and are cotton.  They seem comfortable.  I also found some sports bras at Walmart that have the hook in the  back.  They are cotton, really soft.  Maybe 1 of these would work?  I cannot imagine going w/out a bra.  The rubbing on a shirt seems like it would be worse?? Debby,  Do you know what day you start this coming up week? Well...still thinking & praying for all of you!! Hugs!! Sue  ",

I've completed 13 treatments...today is my 14th.  I have started with some \"hive like\" areas which itch.  My Dr. gave me Biafene but it doesn't say on the tube it's for itching and it doesn't relieve itching so well.  I am going to see if I can get something else today.  Someone had mentioned that the area that has been exposed to the sun over the years will be where the skin reaction will be the worse.  That is the case with me, it's where my skin has been suntanned over the years.  I would have thought it would be the opposite.  I can see my treated area pretty clearly at this point.  A rectangle shaped darker area.  My tape is starting to come loose, I guess they will have to put new tape on.  They get out the blue magic marker each day and redraw the lines. I definitely have some shooting pains and soreness but not real bad. I think I'm feeling some fatigue but not sure if it was because my folks were here (from Minnesota) over the weekend and I overdid the cooking/cleaning!?  I felt like I had no energy vs. tired. I have enjoyed reading how all of you are doing and using your good tips. I've tried every aluminum free deo. and they make me stink I think...LOL!  This week I'm trying the Cornstarch baby powder.  I think someone on here was using the cooking cornstarch and I was too (oops!)  Then I read on here to get the baby corn starch.  Whoever said they are using real deo on the other armpit...I am too!!! I made myself a sticker chart with 33 squares on it.  Each day when I get home I put a smiley face sticker on the chart.  It helps to see the progress!  I think I will need something fun at the end of the chart.  Any ideas? I think we'll all have some ups and downs.  I had a good cry yesterday.  Although I've completed 13 rads and I am feeling so good for the most part... I've still got 20 to go. Seems overwhelming and I worry about this radiation being zapped into me...and let's face it...we're being treated for bc.  Most days are good tho.  :) My 3 techs who do my treatment are so nice.  I am thankful for that.  They play jazz music in the room and if anyone likes jazz... I've discovered a new artist - - Mindi Abair - - very \"up\" music. :) Doe, you made me laugh with your description of the fans in the treatment room because of the odor.  You are so right.  I shower my armpit just before I go...but they nearly have their nose in my pit to line up the durn machine.  I usually put on some Bath and Body Works pink grapefruit lotion (on my hands only!)  before I go.  I usually put a little drop on my side so they smell that fresh smell and not my pit..ha, ha!  (no lotion in the treatment area of course!!) Deb,  I am so glad you are finally starting today!  I hope it goes really well.  I as soo nervous for the first few days but then I got used to it.  I hope your techs are really nice... it makes it more bearable.  Keep us posted! Kajo,  I have had some pain when I take a deep breath, and it seemed like it started after my surgery in Dec.  I asked my surgeon about it and she said it was normal and would go away.  I still have it some.  My cancer was against my chest wall so I think that has something to do with it? I better get showered and head to treatment. I hope you are all doing as good as possible...and I pray for each of you every day!!! Hugs!!  Sue",

Deb, you may find the Biafene works better once you need it.  It is soothing for me now that I am itching like crazy.  My Dr. really encouraged me to use it only when I needed it.  At first I was going to use it as a preventative/moisturizer and it did sting.  I think it's more of a skin repair type lotion vs. very moisturizing. I had a down day today... not sure why?  I had lunch with a friend ~  do you ever feel like people avoid your bc and act like life is normal but you're sitting there thinking...

Luv, Aww... you're so nice!  I love to read your encouraging posts to all of us!!      Your Dr. said... \"Oh, you chose Radiation??\"  Hmm...why wouldn't you???  I think we all want to do whatever we can to make sure we get it all.. and increase our chances of it not coming back!?  I think your sunny personality will eventually win him over!!   I think you're on to something... rads do cause bipolar!  They need to add that to the brochure under \"side effects.\"  I don't think the Dr.'s tell us about all of the side ef.  Just see how we react and then say... \"oh yes...that's a side eff.\" I think you've got #19 today...best wishes!! Doe,  How long do you have to wait to find out what the spot is?  I am praying it's a Sertoma.  Is this something they can drain the fluid off of?  I hope you have the energy to do something fun during these 2 weeks if at all possible.   You deserve some R&R... you've gone thru so much!   Trish,  What???  You lost weight on rads??  There goes my theory on that!!??  I better get this under control then... I hear the Tamoxifen can put some pounds on you....  I noticed my mold was a bit tight on my butt the last few days... I had to squeeze into it!?  Sue in NJ, I so hope your sore throat goes away!  Are you definitely having further tests on that?  I have had a cough for weeks now...  I mentioned it to my nurse yesterday but when the Dr. came in...she marked me for my boosts and we never discussed my concerns.  Do you have a cough with this??  Deb,  what a bummer to have nausea!?  I had about 2 spells of it but have felt ok for the most part.  There was another gal at my clinic that had nausea also.  I've seen her several times and she says the meds have helped her.  Hope this will be the case with you. Hope everyone has a good day Love & Prayers, Sue xoxo",

I should be so excited I am done...and get on with my life... but... I'm exhausted and keep having flashbacks of all that I've done...  Any little thing makes me want to cry... and then I get overwhelmed with the whole thing once again.  Doesn't anyone understand ALL that I've been thru???  Oh yes... The Feb Rad Team does!!  Thanks you great girls!!   Tay, I hope you will feel better and better... I'm going up and down...  Still waiting for the clown to show up at the door with balloons and say \"you're amazing and brave...great job!!\"  LOL  I am not usually self centered...  I just know what I would do if it were someone else completing this... or.. now I will know what to do!  Also....  I did Weight Watchers 6 years ago and lost 55 pounds and have been able to keep it off by continuing to eat healthy.  I lost 11 pounds in the first 2 weeks and was so excited.  I think you can even do it online.  Anyway... that one really worked for me.  I started walking for 20 min each day also, along with the diet and I think that helped.  Just to give some encouragement.  I will say the first week or so of the diet I thought I would starve... but once I found some low \"point\" treats... I was ok.    Doe, you describe thoughts and emotions so perfectly.  Honestly, you need to write a book so bc patients know it's ok to feel all of these things.  Please include a chapter on \"detoxing\" since we have all subscribed to that from your post!!  Your snow sounds kind of pretty to me.  I had to put one of those snowmen in my yard that blows up and lights up for the winter... no real snow in NC.  Luv, don't worry - - I have not left you!!     You made me laugh when you said you are so energetic that you overdo..and then pay.  That is so me...  I go 100% one day and then the next day...time for cat nap!  The problem is...once I go 100% then I think my hubby thinks...oh good...she's all well...and then I crash...LOL  I will be checking on you all next week... and don't be surprised if you feel sad to be ending the rads...  it seems to be totally normal... Sue ~ I've been thru the teen years!  My 2 girls are now 24 and 22...but my oldest tried everything!?  I can tell that you have given the girls a wonderful Christian upbringing... some of the stuff they will do will be normal and they will for the most part hold what's right and wrong in their hearts.  We just had to take 1 \"speed bump\" as we called it at a time...and pray alot for their safety!  Bummer it's happening during all that's going on with you.  God must think you're amazing...since he's piled so much on your plate!    You will be glad for the 25 treatments and 9 boosts.  It will be easier on your skin in full treatment area, it can begin to heal...and I had no side effects/pain from the boosts at all... hope it's the same for you!! Tina ~ I gave my techs a picture frame on the last day...with a thank you message framed inside.  I actually added a bow and some seashells since the beach is my favorite.  I gave them a gift card to a frozen custard place for Easter... just a few ideas.  :) PA ~  just a side note... my Dr. told me that my being \"small chested\" was to my advantage... less side effects.  I did find this to be true.  What day do you start again?  Best wishes to you!!  Well... I'm considering an Apple Pucker tonight.  It's 80 in Raleigh and I'm sitting on the deck.  Perhaps a toast to my fine job of completing rads! Have a wonderful weekend friends!! hugs to all!! Sue xo",

Laurie Luv, Your dog \"Minnie\" is too cute!  I was thinking... do you want to adopt me as your sister so I can go on the cruise?  (just kidding!)  It is so fun that the entire family is signing up and celebrating with you!!!  I am wondering if I did have the IMRT rads?  I read thru the info (thanks!) and I think I must have.  Duke must be \"state of the art\" right??  They have not posted a bill to my insurance yet...so not sure of the cost?  Oh my stars... yours was $75,000???  and you have to pay 10%?  How does it feel not to have to drive for treatments?  How is your fatigue?  Skin??  Sue Deg, I am having trouble sleeping which has never happened to me??  I may need to ask for some ambien.  I either do not fall into a deep sleep or I wake up for some reason and my mind starts thinking.  I sleep well about 1 out of 3 nights!?  I'm sorry your daughter is experimenting with some things.  My oldest experimented with everything...and I totally understand the trust issue.  We always thought the worst and had to keep her on a tight rope.  They were tough years!?  I tried to love her throughout and keep reinforcing the good behaviors.  She had been raised in church etc. and in her heart I knew she knew right from wrong.  The peer pressures and trying to be liked!?  She is now 24 and married... and doing great!  Hang in there!  I am so glad you got yourself a necklace and have some fun plans to look forward to to celebrate finishing chemo & rads!  Redo the house and do something fun with your family this summer!  You have been thru so much...continued to work... and you need to do something fun!  Your whole family needs it!!  :)  Doe, I am going to try and figure out how to see you on t.v.!  Great job!  As Luv said... you are an excellent communicator... I bet you were amazing!  That's so neat you help folks with disabilities... it must be so rewarding!  And... way to go... with your short hair and sleeve... I think you were all the more powerful... trying to help the disabled when you have your own situation!  God is smiling in your balcony!!  I am so glad you are feeling good!!  Hey... if your mean neighbor likes your hair... maybe you should keep it short... (that made me laugh!! )  Tay, so glad you are doing so well!!  Do the happy dance... you've been thru alot...and celebrate that proth!!  :) Well... I am doing good.  Now that I am done with my treatments... I am trying to start the next chapter of my life and trying not to dwell on cancer.  At least every other hour I don't think about it...and then I think..  oh gosh... that was me that did all that and how overwhelming it is!  I cannot escape from it, it's everywhere - - 1. Just when I finished my rads, my friend was diagnosed with a recurrence of bc. I so feel like I need to be there for her, she was there for me.  I have prayed about it and feel like I have the strength to be there for her.  We had a good talk and she knows I've just walked this... and she is sensitive to my emotions.  2. Every show I watch has breast cancer!?  Yesterday \"Ellen\" had Hillary Clinton on her show and they discussed bc as Hillary has bc as one of her main focuses! Then Kylie Minogue came on the show (that cute blonde singer) and she is a bc survivor.  Ellen proceeded to talk about her Mom and sister who've had bc...and she had a lumpectomy!  Today Oprah had a college basketball coach on...and she had had bc.  There was someone who had helped her thru her bc  that she had never met (maybe on this website?  I missed that part)... Oprah arranged it so she could meet this angel who had helped her thru her bc.  Oh gosh... time for a detox!  I think we should all go on Oprah and meet each other!!  Doe, can you arrange that for us with your t.v. connections?? Anyway..  I had some whopper shooting pains yesterday and then today I was kind of tired and dizzy?  Guess the rads are still doing their work?? I start Tamoxifen in the next day or so... can you tell I am putting it off?  I was reading the Tamox threads on here... and they are not real uplifting.  I am going to gain 25 lbs, have belly fat, joint pain, dizziness, hot flashes...  I have been praying... my SE's will be minimal!?  I have worked so hard to feel good physically/emotionally... I don't want to take it!!    But.. it may save my life! For those of you who have not finished treatments yet... Doe is right!  Plan a celebration for yourself!  This milestone will mean the most to you...and others may not think of it!  I wish I would have planned something!  It's hard to go back to the old routine... live each day to the fullest!! Ok.. you've all inspired me...  I need to sign up for the Susan G. walk!! Still praying each day for each of you! Love, Sue xoxo   ",

I talk with my daughters and ask them something...and I must not listen to what they said...because I have to ask them again..  I just blame it on the rads!  Well...DH wants to take a walk...so I'll sign off for now.

I am exhausted.  I had out-of-town guests from last Thurs. thru yesterday (Wed.) for my daughter's Graduation.  I think preparing for the visitors..and feeding/entertaining them... I overdid!!  I have been in slow motion for 2 days...but it feels good to slow down!!!  I had my 6 week re-check with my Rad Onc last Thurs.  She said my skin looks good etc. (only peeling in boost area)  It was so weird to walk back in there - - it was de-ja-vu.  It was good to see everyone again, and we all hugged!!  I got to go back and see my 3 rad techs!!    I asked my Dr. about the neck stiffness and she felt as tho I had either pulled something in my neck or it  could be from the Tamoxifen.. it can cause some stiffness.  It is a bit better... so that is good.  I have to go back to the Rad. in Sept. and get a mamm every 6 mts. (next one is in Aug.)  Hem Onc appt is 6/18. Any advice on sunscreen for the rad area?  I am a beach/pool girl and I'm going to end up with a white rectangle from my colar bone clear around to my armpit??  I can't figure out what sort of swimsuit to wear?  I am so afraid to get any sun near this area...eek! Ulla, I am so sorry you had that reaction to the Tamoxifen!?  Did you call your Dr. about it?  Are you still taking it?  I started it on April 15th and I feel pretty good emotionally/no nausea... but I do have some hot flashes.  It may make a difference based on our ages tho.  I am older than you and I think I was pre-menopause which is probably to my advantage.  Less of a shock to my system??  I'm just guessing here... I do seem to cry easier since I've been on it!?  More emotional or sentimental??  That would make me mad if my Dr. did not remember me either... or what he told me to do!!??  How are you doing???  Your new picture is great - - you are so pretty!!  :) Doe,  good gracious, you have to wear a heart monitor 24/7 for 30 days??  What exactly are they watching for?  I hope all is ok with your port... I can't believe they did not tell you it needed to be flushed.  I know you will be glad to get rid of that!!  I can't believe your Rad told you they were seeing something...and now it's nothing of concern - - BUT, I am soo glad it's nothing!!  I worried with you!  Aww.. so nice your hubby got you purple flowers for Mom's Day!!  I got a pink bike... I think some of the proceeds go to Susan G. Komen. Tay, You sound good!  I wish I was creative and had art as an outlet.  Will you post your paintings? MaryJo, your little grandson is just adorable!! Sue in NJ, Hope all is well Laurie, So glad your cruise was the best!!  I have a feeling you were the brightest of the group!!  I am feeling really good for the most part.  I love the smell of honeysuckle in the spring - - the other day I found some blooming in my yard and I got choked up!?  It is so good to feel good and smell the honeysuckle of spring!  Just trying to enjoy the \"little things\" in life more. My continued prayers for all of you!!  Love, Sue xoxo   ",

Hope you all had a good weekend.  Doe,  You have been through so much and all that you are feeling is so normal.  I pray daily for you and for better days ahead.  We are all here for you... at least just to listen and validate how you are feeling.  We all share the same emotions, fears, sadness...  so much of what you wrote about I can relate to!  You describe things so well, that I could not put my finger on.  Anyway... I read your post and it did provide a good \"detox\" cry for me!  It's been so long... I needed one!!  One day at a time... it's got to get better!! Sue, Laurie..  I'm with you on the tiredness.  I'm still not up to my 100% self!?  My energy level is just not there.  It may be the Tamoxifen to an extent tho?? I went to the beach for the weekend.  I kept the rad area covered and sunscreened but I've had some shooting pains in that area?  Hmm... I wonder if the suns rays/heat cause a reaction with the rad. still there?? My latest emotion is \"trying to live each day to the fullest.\"  I just feel this need to do things differently... or have more fun??  I think we all live in fear of bc coming back and I just want to do everything I always wanted to do!??  Now to convince DH that some of the chores can wait...we need to play more!!??  I want to get out of the old routine a little!  I'm like Doe.  My head is spinning with so many thoughts of the past few months... Dr.'s appointments, surgeries...rad. treatments... friends and family who loved me... and those who disappeared.  I am trying so hard to go back to my old life...but somehow it's impossible.  I'm a different person now, a bc survivor!  I still sometimes feel like this was just a bad dream??  Oh well.. there was my vent! Hugs to all!! Love, Sue xo ",

I am done with 8 treatments... 25 to go!  I will also have the extra boosts with my last treatments.  So far so good.  No redness, but I am sore kind of like after surgery... and a few shooting pains.  Doe ~  I am sorry you're having the discomfort, but you still have your sense of humor!  You make me laugh.. and gave me a good idea for when my pain kicks in.  I still have some pain meds left from after surgery... good idea to put them to use!!  :)  I am hoping you can keep your strength up so you can use that PTO for a FUN VACATION!!  You deserve it!!! Diane ~  I am so happy for you that you have completed your treatments!!!  Your Dr. sounds so kind - - I am happy you had him!!  :)  I had to laugh when you mentioned the magic marker... My mark in 1 spot keeps smearing...and every other day I smell the magic marker! Sue & Ulla ~  I have read and was told by my Dr. to stay away from Antioxidants and vitamins and herbal supplements.  I came down with a cold my first week of rads and specifically asked about it... she said not to take any of them. (Airborne)  Ulla, I would ask your Dr.  I thought it was ok to get antioxidants in \"natural\" form tho - - as in juices and tomatoes??  I drank orange juice to help with my cold.  Hope that was ok?? Cornstarch vs. Aluminum free deodarant?  I have tried the Alum. free deo and it is not working for me??  Is the cornstarch a type of deo. or is it literally cornstarch? I can't remember who asked about deo/lotion prior to treatment but I was told not to put either on until after treatments each day. Quinnie ~  You are 7 treatments ahead of me and mention the fatigue has started.  Is it lack of energy or just plain tiredness?  I'm wondering what to expect. Mary Jo & Sue ~ tomorrow is your first treatment!  Hope it goes really well!  I have completed 8 and I really feel great so far.  I have to say... I was so nervous for my first few...but once I got into the routine of going there and got to know the techs... it's really not too bad.  Deb ~ Did you get a call yet???  I hope you can start soon!  I feel for you...the waiting stinks!!!  Keep us posted! Lisa ~ I have completed 8 treatments and so far nearly no side effects, just to give you a gauge.  My Dr. said about week 4 I may start experiencing something.  You have been thru sooo much... I think it's ok if your are a bit down!  I hope you have some dear family and friends around you...and you have all of us on this board!!  :) Candy ~  I have been thinking of you all week.  I am so glad week 2 is over with and you're back home!  I have been praying like crazy for you!! Sorry I always have so much to say but I think of all of you and say prayers too! God Bless the Feb Rad Girls!! love, sue :) ",

Luv, I'm with you on the fatigue.  It's like every other day.  My mind is energetic but my body and muscles are lazy!  Drink that tea and pamper yourself.  Save your energy for only the important things.  :)  My picture was taken in Oct. at my Daughter's rehearsal dinner prior to her Wedding.  :)  I have 2 daughters also, ages 22 and 24.  I bet yours are a bit younger.  Ok.. the baby corn starch has seemed to stop working in the treated arm pit!?  I go for treatment # 18 today.  I seem to have a case of like sun poisoning which itches terrible!  The Biafene and Cortizone barely help.  Is there anything stronger???  I have these spells of shooting pains that take my breath away.  Advil seems to help with that. I better head that way!! TGIF and we can all take a 2 day break!! ~Sue xo Kajo, Are you taking Tamoxifen?  Just wondering if that is the cause of your hot flashes or if it's just menopause in general. ",

Well... had #27 today... 4 to go!  I am dreading saying goodbye to my new friends at Duke Radiology, you would think I would be elated not to have to go!?  I have brought treats also (smiley gumballs and last week...cookies!)  I am doing tiny Easter Baskets for my  3 techs to take tomorrow.  The grumpy receptionists are even friendly to me now (killed em with kindness ) so they may get a treat too..but then again... the nurses are so nice...  I'll be broke!?  Maybe I need Quinnie's Poppyseed Bread recipe?? I can honestly say the fatigue has hit me!  I feel so tired and a little dizzy.  I am trying to be my 100% energetic self...but my body is not cooperating?  The fatigue seems to be affecting my mood a bit too - - I have had a few sad spells this week.  Sue,  I hope your swelling goes away!  I will pray specifically about that!  Thanks for the info on the Tamoxifen.  I am kind of dreading it...but it's something I must do...and hope for the best.  I am also premenopausal and my Dr. was talking about the hot flashes, mood swings etc. yesterday.  She said if it gets too unbearable, she can prescribe something to help.  I would imagine an antidepressant?  I will try and get thru this without that - - Phil. 4:13!!  I cringe at the thought of putting drugs in my body (I did Weight Watchers 6 years ago...lost 55 pounds... kept it off..and eat healthy)  Have you noticed any weight gain with the Tamox?  I managed to gain 4# on rads... think it was comfort food??  Wow, you're doing a good job of working and keeping up with your girls...and all of this bc stuff!  :)  That's alot!!  Well... think I'll catch a \"cat\" nap before it's time to start dinner.

Ulla, I think we were writing at the very same time!!  :)  I had a feeling that maybe our ages would affect our response to Tamoxifen.  I hope each day gets better for you!  My Dr. told me once I adjust to it that it will be better.  It takes awhile for your body to adjust to it.  Sometimes I feel kind of faint after I take it for awhile, but it passes.  When do you take your pill?  I take mine at 9 in the morning with alot of water and my breakfast.  I wonder if that would help if you ate something with it? I read on another thread on this website where some were taking 1/2 pill in morning and 1/2 pill before bed.  I wonder if that would help?  Also, I read on that thread that symptoms from Tamox are much worse just before your period, moods, hot flashes etc.  I have no idea what my period is doing.  I did not get it at all in April (before I started Tamox) and it never came in May?  I have never missed 1  before, but not sure what happened in April before Tamox?  I know Tamox may cause it to stop. Is your Zoladex like a shot you give yourself?  Oh gosh... I would wait for my DH to be there too!  How often do you do this??  You have been thru soo much... I cannot blame you for having a good crying spell after you went to that Dr. who was forgetful...  I don't think the tears were from the Tamoxifen...it was from that Dr.!!  I hope each day is better and better!! Doe, I'm not sure what a TIA is?  At any rate, I hope they figure out what is causing them, and it can be treated fairly easy, with a little pill or something.  You need a break from Dr.'s and need to feel good!!!  I think you need 10 days up north to take a break next!!  Hugs!

How is everyone??  :) Sue, How did your techs like those cupcakes?  Are you enjoying some freedom from not having to go for rads every day??  I got some Tylenol PM and I take 1 before bed.  That has helped me sleep so much sounder.  Thanks for the tip!!  I need to read the fine print on the bottle and make sure it's not addicting!!??  Yes... it was my oldest daughter (in pict) that was married...and she was my challenging one!  ;)  She is a wonderful young lady now! Laurie, you are too clever --> yes!  we are the \"Feb-ulous Girls!!\" :)  You wrote where you now look at old people and feel differently... I am doing the same thing... I look at them and think... I pray I will live long and grow as old as you!  Doe, I am so glad your days are getting better and better!!  :) Darah, thanks for the encouraging words!!  :) Larousse, hope your treatments are going well...and minimal side effects!  What # are you on? Tay, Please let me know about the Tamoxifen alternatives.  I know what you mean about not wanting to leave the house and see people.  Some days I just feel like its easier to just be home and be me.  It's exhausting to go out and try and be \"good old Sue\" as I tell my hubby.  I am always the nice, happy one...and I try to maintain that no matter how I feel inside. Ulla, love your picture!!  You are so pretty!!  Let me know what your Dr. says about the Tamoxifen... or other options... I am doing really well.  My skin is peeling a bit again, especially in the boost area.  I am still definitely experiencing some fatigue.  If I overdo it one day... the next I am kind of tired.  I started Tamoxifen on Mon.  I have felt a little dizzy...and a bit tired....but I can't decide if it's the Tamox, still the rads??  Every time I get a pain... I'm like... ok..what is this???  I am overly learly of the side effects but praying for a minimum.  It's gorgeous in Raleigh today... sunny and near 80.  Think I will take my walk! Hugs and prayers to all!! Love, Sue xoxo   ",

I cannot stand the thought of another appointment for now.  I do think it's nerve endings coming back to life?? I am suppose to have a mammo on Thurs.  That is only 4 mts out from my last rads.  Hmm... after reading Mary Jo's post... do you think I should wait?  What has everyone's experience been with this timing?  Luv, I am so thrilled for you that your BRCA tests came back negative - - wonderful news!!  Did you get the hip checked yet??  That is wonderful that you are doing the Susan G. Komen walk.  It was here in Raleigh in June but I was not ready for the emotional part of it yet.  I have kind of a funny story about it tho - -  I decided I wanted a new bike to ride around the neighborhood.  For some reason I wanted a \"PINK\" bike...somewhat symbolic of my BC journey??  Me and my hubby went to REI in Raleigh to look at bikes.  When we got to the store, there were these 12 foot pink BC ribbons on each side of the door... we walk in and a lady walks up to me and says... are you here to sign up for the Susan G. Komen BC Walk??  I was like... no... I'm here to buy a bike.  I said to my DH... as much as I try to have a break from thinking of BC... it's even in my face going out to buy a bike!?  As we were looking at bikes there was a steady stream of women picking up their packets for the walk...  ahh...what timing.  I had to have my attitude adjustment... the funds they have raised have helped me tremendously!   Ulla, how are you doing on the Tamoxifen these days?  And the Zoladex injections?  I hope your body is adjusting and you are feeling so much better!!  :)  I had to laugh a bit when you wrote that your hubby told you to stop talking to us on this website!?  My DH asks me periodically if I still get on to talk with all of you... I think it bothers him a bit...but I need it!!  ;)   Doe, it was so good to read that you and your hubby had a great vacation..and were able to just talk thru some things and get on better footing - - great news!!  I hope things have continued to improve!!  I've been praying for you!!  I think I will get a copy of the book you suggest.  Congrats on getting some of your articles published - - WOW!!  What were the final results after wearing the heart monitor?  Sue D. - Glad to hear your \"shooty pains\" have let up.  I am hoping mine do soon!  I am so sorry that your daughter is going thru these \"stages\" at this point in your life.  I know the amount of stress it can put on you and the family...and you really don't need it right now with all that you've been thru in the past year!?  I've been praying for you and I hope things are getting a bit better.  I hope your daughter gets a \"reality check\" and starts to make better choices.  I can tell you've given her a great foundation and she will eventually return to it.  I've been thru this and I know how hard it is...    MaryJo, a belated Happy Anniversary to you and your hubby!  Isn't it amazing how just going out and having fun or doing the simplest things you most enjoy are even that much more fun now??  Thanks for the info on Mammo after Rads... I need to figure out if I want to have my mammo this Thurs, only 4 mts out from rads.  I think I will call my Dr. and ask the question.  Do you ever go to the NC coast?  My favorite is Topsail Island.  :)  Tay, glad you are dating again.  Hope it's going well!!  :)  What are you doing as an alternate to Tamoxifen??  I've been on it since mid April and so far so good for the most part.  Hello Quinnie and anyone else I may have missed.  Think of you all so often and how much you encouraged and helped me over these past few months..THANK YOU!!   I'll let you know about my Mammo on Thurs. if I have it...  Love,  Sue xoxo",

If I could ask for some extra thoughts and prayers - - I have been feeling so good since bouncing back from my rads.  Last week I went to Minnesota to visit my family for 8 days.  While I was there I got my period (have not had since March, I think due to starting Tamoxifen)  Just before I got my period I had terrible pain in the left side of my abdoman.  Then... I had a problem with my bladder where I was not able to \"go\" and this happened for 2 days of my visit.  I was at Urgent Care twice.  I know I have uterine firbroids and I think these may have enlarged due to the Tamoxifen??  At any rate, my bladder is feeling better but I still have some abdominal pains.  I had an appt already scheduled with my Rad Onc tomorrow so I am going to talk with her and I am sure I will be on to more tests etc.  I am so not up for additional tests and honestly scared of what they might find.  I think we all live in fear with each ache and pain.  I'll keep you posted and I hope this is something simple.  Have any of you had any odd side effects on Tamox?  I still think of all of you in my daily prayers!!  Love, Sue xoxo",

I am half way!  My shooting pains and itching get worse and worse, but I feel better than I thought I would at this point... so for that I am thankful. Doe,  Someone had recommended something to me on a different thread for open blisters etc.  I will go find the info and post it here shortly. Deb, I did feel a bit faint after my first treatment but I think it was a total case of nerves/stress.  It's scarey to be on that table being radiated for bc!  After a day or so, once I knew what was going to happen... I felt so much better.  I would definitely ask the Dr. about this if it keeps up.  You should not be receiving any rays other than the breast tissue area.  I can tell by looking at the machine/lens area that the beams only come out of a small square area.  I would ask them about this to be sure they are not radiating too large an area. Bloodwork ~  Yes, I do have blood drawn every 3rd week.  I asked the nurse what they were looking for and she said they want to keep an eye on your white blood count, platelettes etc.  Blood is made in the bones and some bones are being radiated.  They want to monitor to make sure your blood count is maintaining. Baby Corn Starch - I finally found something that seems to work!  The alum free deo's and cooking corn starch  did not work! Candy, are you in town this week??  How are you?? Luv, I hope you won't have to go for too many treatments.  I always thought it was 33 and was surprised mine was 31 (what a difference 2 days can make!!)  I asked the techs about it and they said each person is prescribed differently.  Everything I've read said 33 was the norm.  Will you have some days of just boosters? Aquafor - I have some of this but it is super thick.  My Dr. gives me Biafene and it seems to work fairly well and is real thin...easy to spread on sore skin.  Doe had mentioned Miaderm also. (order on their website or toll free #) Another day...another treatment down for each of us.  Hope you all have a good day!  ~Sue xoxo",

Hope you all had a wonderful Easter!!  :) I had boost #6 today - - only 2 more to go and I am done.  It will be hard for me to say goodbye to my techs, they've been such a blessing with their kindness!  My patient navigator said it's normal to feel kind of sad about ending this chapter, it certainly becomes your life for 6 1/2 weeks.  Mary Jo over there in Western NC...so good to here from you!  Everything you are experiencing is totally normal!!  I also hit a \"depressed\" spot in the middle of my rads... I was doing really well and down I went?  Week 6 was wierd for me also... so if you have a few down days.. that may be normal also.  I have also felt kind of odd and flu like.  My body temp has been off and sometimes when I'm out at a store I feel like I may faint or something??  I head home at that point.  Sometimes once I eat a little something I feel a bit better.  I think Doe put it best... It's Radiation Fatigue and it's hard to describe it exactly... just feel funky!?  I know my Dr. wanted me to stay the same weight also... they weigh me each week.  I actually gained 3 or 4 pounds!? (comfort food....)  At any rate, the physics they use to calculate our treatment area, probably to a millimeter would be off a bit if a person lost 10+ pounds during the course of treatment.  I guess I would follow the Dr.'s orders for now.  Hang in there!!!  ;)  How 'bout that Carolina Basketball team?? SueDeq, hope your daughter passed her Drivers Test!  :)  I can remember when my oldest got her license... I let her take her younger sister for ice cream.  I was a nervous wreck...prayed the whole time they were gone... but it was so nice she could drive her sister here and there... and big help!!  Yes.... I am peeling!  Even tho I'm on my boosts... I'm getting these welts in the other area which itch like crazy and then bust like a blister.  All of my skin is really rough and dry.  You're right... the Tamoxifen will be my magic pill also... to keep this bc away!!  Thanks for the positive feedback on the side effects!  I like your \"balanced\" diet of Girl Scout cookies, Easter candy... fruits and veggies - - perfect!!  :) Tay - you are finishing a day ahead of me!!  Thanks for mentioning the night sweats.  I have started these during rads - - can't figure out if it's menopause kicking in...or rads??  I have also had trouble sleeping soundly... I keep waking up??  Does anyone know if Rads accelerate menopause for some reason?  I think I was pre-meno...but seems like I may be more into it?  Have not started the Tamoxifen yet. Doe, I loved the \"Good Cry\" info you posted.  Just excellent..and so true!  Glad you had your Apple Pucker! ;)  I had a half glass of wine the other night and my arms tingled.  Hmm.. maybe wine and rads is not such a good idea??  Hows the smell/taste?? Luv, you started your boosts today!  How was it??  I think you will find that they go really fast (do you have only 1 zap?) and your other skin will begin to feel better.  9 to go after today!!!!! Mpellot, you've come to the right place!  We are all feeling and experiencing what you are!!  We understand!!  I am always so \"up\" and positive but this bc really hits me like a ton of bricks at times!  I subcribe to Doe's article posted and cry my head off and feel better!  No one really understands the ups and downs of this but all of us who are living it... one day at a time.  I try to stay so \"up\" that everyone thinks I'm perfectly fine...but inside sometimes I'm not so \"up.\"  I know how you feel.  I also have a strong faith in God and wonderful hubby and family...friends... but some days are just plain hard!!  It's ok!!  All of the people at my Rad. are so much older than me.  I do ask myself.... why am I going thru this so young??  I love old people and try to be kind to them each day... it perks up my spirits a bit.  I have a confession to make...  I snook and used real deodarant this weekend and used a razor on my unburnt section of my pit!  LOL!  I figure since I'm in the boost stage I would sneak and do this... I'm such a rebel!!  ;) Wish you all a good week!! Prayers and hugs!! Sue xoxo",

Doe, How was your weekend??  I hope you had some time just for you, to do whatever you wanted or had the energy to do!  I'm glad you had a good detox after watching that movie!  My hubby took Thurs and Fri off.  He wanted to go to the coast but I did not have the energy.  It was kind of a rocky weekend, not sure he enjoyed my ups and downs??  I tried to be my best, but definitely tired and emotional.  I like your \"invisible wheelchair\" and elephant centerpiece!  I don't look or act a bit sick...so let's not talk about it!  Yes!  You deserve a dozen roses now.... you've done an amazing job of fighting this bc each step of the way!!! Luv, you're right...we work our way down the list and check things off...but these emotions are not to be checked off.  They just keep coming \"unchecked!?\"  I was wondering about my fried skin... and the damage this is causing??  I am a suntan buff...but I need to stop this...  but what damage do I have from rads??  Wow, the cruise sounds like a wonderful surprise!!  I totally understand your feelings about going with a different body (what type of swimsuit to wear?) and keeping the rad area out of the sun.  How soon are you going?  Are the girls going also?  I hope you will have enough time to sort thru all of this and get the perfect wardrobe to be comfortable... and you can go and just have a fun, relaxing time - - you deserve it! 4 more treatments after today... you're getting close!!!   MPellot, Was the oncotype an extra test? or... would it have been on my path report?  Which Dr. did this for you... I have so many to chose from.. ha, ha.  I'm with Luv on the Domeboro lotion - -I would be leary of the aluminum ingredient.  My understanding was that alum. would tamper with the effectiveness of rads.  Also... the baby cornstarch powder worked the best for me also for deo.  I am starting Tamoxifen next Mon.   Have you started it already?  I am dreading the hot flashes...but it's what I've got to do.  Sue, I am having trouble sleeping also.  I have never had this problem... it must be the rads.  I wake up overheated.... not sure if I'm starting menopause in the middle of all of this??  Or...does rads goof up your body temp??  When I wake up my mind starts thinking...and I cannot get back to sleep.  I love Amer Idol too!  I think all of them are so good... I'm sad each time one is let go.  You should definitely plan something special for your last day of treatment!  I had expectations that it would be a big deal to family/friends and for the most part no one even remembered.  It was such a big deal to me and I should have planned something really fun after.  Coming home was kind of a let down.  Well... it's been 4 days since my last treatment.  My booster area is pretty red and fried, and I have had more shooting pains than I ever had...  Advil works good for me.  The rads definitely seem to be still working, even after we're thru.  Emotionally I can say I am thankful I don't have to drive to Duke.  It's cold and rainy in Raleigh, and I am cozy in my pj's.  Does anyone find it totally awkard to be a person with bc and wish you were just your old self?  I run into people that I know...that know I have bc and they don't even ask \"how are you?\"  I am super nice to them and ask about them...but lets not discuss bc!!?  Then... you run into someone you have not seen yet and you have to go thru the whole thing...and then they say... oh good , you're done and back to normal...  normal????  Still adjusting to the emotions and reactions of being a person with bc.  It's the elephant again.... I pray for you all by name each morn! Gentle hugs too! Sue       ",

My energy level is really coming back up!  I think not having to drive to Duke and be on that schedule and the energy it takes is helping!  Maybe some relief from being done with that phase??  Like DeAnn said tho - - soon to start the daily pill.. to remind me... Hmm... for some reason my armpit is majorly red and started peeling also??  I wonder if the boosts were somehow zapping that area also?  The rest of my skin out of boost area is really healing nicely...

Luv, I am glad your cruise is in May and not next week!  This will give you time to heal and just get prepared.  I bet you'll feel so much better by then!!  It sounds sooo fun!!  Yes!  We need to live for today!!  You've inspired me to go shopping for something fun - - this cleaning is too much work!!    Well... hope you are all having a good day!
