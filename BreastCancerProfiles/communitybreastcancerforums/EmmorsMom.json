      "Content": "EmmorsMom wrote: So I am 31yo and I just had my 2nd child 10 weeks ago. Breastfeeding didn't work but instead I have been pumping to provide for my little girl. On Monday I pumped a little more than usual. When I woke up Tuesday morning, my left breast was engorged, hot and painful. Nothing could touch it. I thought it was from too much pumping and went on my day. At lunch time, I felt the chills coming on and thought I might be getting the flu. Then I remembered the flu like symptoms of mastitis so I check my temp and it was 100.5. I decided to keep pumping and massaging and took some Tylenol for the fever. Felt decent Tues evening, but spent the whole night with chills and sweats. Wed morning I had a fever of 101.6 so I called the doc and they called in a prescription for some antibiotics. I've been taking them for 2 full days and things haven't improved. The engorgement went away a tiny bit and the fever is gone, but now the bottom of my breast is all red and kinda hard and thick feeling and my nipple is extremely Tender and sore and it puckers a little on the bottom part of the areola. I feel like there is a lump under the nipple but it hurts so much I can't tell. So bcuz it seemed to be getting worse, I called my doc & they had me come in. The doc looked & is concerned its an abscess. She wants me to try a different antibiotic over the weekend. If that doesn't work she wants me to schedule an appointment with a breast specialist to be seen on Monday morning in case they need to drain it. On another note the inside of my left elbow where the funny bone is has been very tender this week and I can feel a small lump when I put my elbow on a hard surface. I know there are lymph nodes in the elbow and that has me concerned. I mentioned it to my doctor and she just looked at my arm and felt it and said she would be concerned about blood clots but didn't see anything like that. Basically I'm concerned about IBC I know that mastitis is often diagnosed incorrectly. I was just wondering what you think of my situation & symptoms and if you have any advice. If its not better by Monday, do I mention ibc to the specialist? Mention the elbow pain? I've read you don't usually get fevers with IBC but who knows really? Any thoughts would be great. I'm really stressing out. My dad died last year of cancer and this is making me really concerned :( Log in to post a reply",

My biggest issue is that I have read studies and stories and blogs from women that thought they had mastitis and whose drs said it was mastitis and ended up with IBC. Lactating women & non lactating. I just feel like I don't know how far to push a dr to look into it...& I don't want to look back with regrets and think I should have asked... The puckered spot/hole on my nipple and the redness spreading from one small area to more skin under my nipple is what concerns me. The doctor said it shouldn't spread or get worse while on antibiotics for 2 days and it did...that's why they asked to see me. Anyways, I'm sorry for wasting people's time. I'll just see what they say on Monday. Thank you.",

The nipple is still sensitive and sometimes I have a lightning bolt like pain shoot from my nipple. The lump is still there under my areola. It's extremely tender & the size hasn't decreased. I've been on antibiotics for 5 days. I'm suppose to call the breast specialist in the morning to confirm whether I want the appointment or not. I just don't know. It doesn't look so horrible now, but that lumpy area under the areola & nipple concerns me. I've been pumping & if its a plugged duct or abscess it just won't go away. I just can't decide if I should see the specialist or wait...I don't want to take her time from other people...",

Can a lump from mastitis hang around this long? It's been a week. And 6 days of antibiotics. The specialist's nurse said to finish the antibiotics & then call my Obgyn if it hadn't completely resolved. Pumping & heat are doing nothing :( I can't help but worry and be scared about that lump. So scared. I hate waiting :(",

The lump is stressing me out so much but I'm trying to wait until Monday when I'm all done with the Meds. But now every ache, pain, or weird feeling makes me worry and consult Dr. Google. Ugh. I wish I had more advice for you. I never even paid my breasts much attention until I started nursing, now it's all I think about!",

It can't be a plugged duct bcuz I've been working on getting it out for a week and nothing has changed. It doesn't hurt to touch at all so I can't imagine it's an abscess.
