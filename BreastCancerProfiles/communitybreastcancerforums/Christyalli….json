I'm lost, numb, scared, pissed, upset, tired... my world was turned upside down yesterday when I heard the words \"your mom has breast cancer\". She went in for pain in her breast last Friday. They found a mass. This past Friday they did a biopsy. Yesterday we got the news. I don't know anything, she will see the oncologist and surgeon next week. I just need someone to relate to. I am an optimist person, I see the light in all situations, yesterday, I feel as though the light was turned out for good. Waiting... waiting... What's next? What do I do?! What do you say to someone who is in for the fight of their life? This is unbelievable. I am reaching out to anyone for advice. How did you (or are you) getting through this? Christy",
