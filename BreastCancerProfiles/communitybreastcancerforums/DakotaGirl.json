      "Content": "DakotaGirl wrote: I'm curious if there are any success stories of implant reconstruction after rads. I finished rads March 2015, and my Doctor FINALLY has given the okay to attempt reconstruction. I had previous implants for years prior to diagnosis, and the radiated side is now encapsulated, with fibrosis and very painful. I was given the option of relocating my back muscle, but I really don't want to do that because I'm a very active tennis player and I need my back muscle where it is. The other option is to replace my existing implant with a new one. Is there any chance this will be successful? Has anyone healed well from this after radiation?
