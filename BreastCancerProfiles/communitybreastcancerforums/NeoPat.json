I have an appointment with my surgeon tomorrow and will make my decision after I talk with her. Good luck. Pat ",

Sorry that I can't describe it any better, but perhaps something to look into. In defence of people who do have a lot of pain after a mastectomy, let me say that I have had two of them at separate times and one hurt a lot and the other hardly at all. No recon either time. I think the difference in my case is that the first time I had pretty extensive cancer and the surgeon removed the lining of the chest wall muscles.  The second time (a week ago) was preventive and she did not do that.

I had an excisional bx in a different area of the same breast a year ago after a core needle bx found ADH.  The excisional bx found LIN. I've decided to get a mastectomy and end all the testing and waiting for results.  I already had one mast. two years ago for multifocal IDC. MRIs are more sensitive and can find things that are not seen on u/s, so I wouldn't automatically blame it on the technician. Pat",
