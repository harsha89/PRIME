I started getting mammos age 40 and just got my third. No issues till now. I got a birads 0 result with asymmetry noted both breasts only on one of the views. I had an ultrasound too with my regular mammogram since I have dense breast my gyno just orders them. Findings from sono are no masses or irregularities. I have my diagnostic mammo (spot compression) today and am freaking out. I have been trying to get pregnant with ivf the last two years and we have some embryos to transfer which is supposed to happen in 2 weeks. I am fearful that is going to be put off - I've even started the hormones already. I have already been through a thyroid cancer scare this year plus a procedure to remove polyps from my uterus that were biopsied and were ok. So part of me is worried about this being something bad and another part of me is worried that it's nothing but will put off my cycle. Asymmetry seems so vague and I am a DD so maybe the first one was not done right - that's what I'm telling myself. Will I find out today at the diagnostic what's going on? I'm in the USA (NYC). Or are many more tests likely ? I am dreading spending the weekend not knowing. Any advice appreciated... Log in to post a reply",

While my referring dr is aware of the ivf the mammogram place was not as they only asked for the meds I am currently taking which at that time was only thyroid meds. I will be clear with the drs today on my past history which includes multiple rounds of ivf meds. It has occurred to me that those drugs could have caused breast changes. I will be sure to ask. I have been through a lot with the infertility and the other scare. When I got the call I was more angry than anything - a now, what kind of feeling. Of course as I read more online I become more scared. I know in my head the googling is not good for my anxiety but I do it anyway. Thanks for your posts.",

They did think this may have been a hormonal change in density. The images they got wer very clear and there is nothing. I was told to come back in a year. I wanted to post an update for other ladies who may be in my shoes. To answer the above questions, I had fertility treatments with hormones throughout the last three years. Religously got mammos every year (and will continue of course! Thank you for all the support !!",
