    "Content": "kris_bc17 wrote: Hi All, my wife was diagnosed with StageIII Inflammatory Breast Cancer (IBD) 3 1/2 yrs ago. She has done well keeping the body cancer free with Herceptin, except that the cancer metastacized to the brain in 2008 and had surgery to remove. A new tumor showed up in 2009 which was treated with Cyber Knife but keeps growing and will have another surgery soon. My wife tried Tykerb last year to have an effect on the brain but had a very bad reaction (pneumonitis) and gave up. Does anybody know if the new drug T-DM1 by Immunogen acts in the brain like Tykerb? Also any StageIII survivor with similar experience would appreciate any advice or exchanging of thoughts/ideas. Thanks -- Chris  Log in to post a reply",
