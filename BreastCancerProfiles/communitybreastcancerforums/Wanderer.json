    "Content": "Wanderer wrote: have a very close relative, a young woman that was diagnosed with breast cancer about 6 years ago. They did the typical, masectomy, chemo. Thought they caught it. Two years later it was in her lungs, and lymph nodes. Just two small tumors. They went to a chemical non-chemo infusion treatment that shrunk the tumors. It stayed that way for a coulple of years. They then did a brain scan cause the chemical does not treat the brain. They found a small tumor there. They operated on it, removed it and did radiation on her whole head. The head has been good for a couple of years. However about 5 months ago, they found that the current chemical treatment was not working any longer, the tumors had started to grow a bi. and they also found a small one in her liver. They put her on an oral chemo, and tested her recently and found that the tumors had grown slightly, and now there was one in her liver. They swithched medications again, another oral chemo, and she will be tested again shortly. What preplexes me is this. They can see those damm tumors, they are small, why don't they hit them with radiation. I know that she is being treated at a very good hospital, but they do not have the most advanced radiation treatments. Can she be helped by radiation? Log in to post a reply",
