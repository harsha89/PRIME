    "Content": "lauralil wrote: Hello everyone, My name is Laura, I'm a graphic design student and I'm developing an iphone application (other platforms will follow) that offers information to people affected by breast cancer. I was touched by a tv programme that I watched last week and so I wanted to do something that would help other people. The app will be aimed at all people affected by breast cancer to raise awareness, offer support and help charities get their information out to the public.  The application is going to include medical definitions, sources of support database, charity information, fundraising and events calendar, alternative therapies, patient stories, breast check how to videos and fundraising events gallery. I will be making absolutely no money from this, I just want to do something worthwhile with my design skills. I hope to be working with a few charities on this project, and my plan is for the app to be free. If there is anyone who would be able to answer 8 simple questions to help me develop this further then please can you send me an email to laura@cprdesign.co.uk I would really appreciate your input in this, as this is going to be a collaborative support project and your answers will determine the services I am going to offer in the app. Many thanks everyone Laura x  Log in to post a reply",
