She has been started on tamoxifen. Today I talked to her onc and she said that they cannot start her chemo since she has a low blood count (they did a transfusion recently). I thought chemo is only started when tamoxifen fails (mom's can is both rec positive). They are also treating her with zometa. Did they decide to start it sooner because cancer is so aggressive and present in so many bones? Shall I push them to start it sooner? How do they check if tamoxifen fails, especially if she just started it 2 months ago? What shall I be pushing doctors to do? The doctors are very good, but it's a state hospital in Europe. I'm afraid they are a bit cowardly. But I'm scared too! I don't want to push for chemo if mom is not ready. What if she will only get worse, god forbid? Please, advice. I always relied on mom's advises, but she can't help me with this. Log in to post a reply",

It actually was serious with new symptoms such as confusion, weakness etc. Since then mom received calcium infusion as well as calcium supplement as a pill (then she was getting ever since she started to receive zometa). However, new blood test again shows low calcium. We are very worried. Mom has extensive bone mets and had 2 fractures previously. Shw was waiting for this zometa like a godsend. She is too weak for chemo, so receives only tamoxifen. We hoped bisphosphates could make her stronger for more treatment. What can we do to increase calcium? Are there other bisphosphates that don't drop calcium? We have been asking onc to do the infusion anyways and increase calcium later. But, she says it's too dangerous. Please, advice. Thank you.

The first one has been treated, but they can't operate on the second (afraid she will not survive surgery). Luckily, she responded to tamox and the mets stopped growing. From, the start of her treatment, we had an argument with doctors, in re using bisphosphonates. She only Zometa twice and every time her calcium dropped to dangerous levels. Every time, doctors managed to bring them up. However, they are now refusing to continue with Zometa at all. Their arguments: she doesn't need it to decrease her calcium; even if they correct the calcium afterwards, this kind of \"shocks\" can cause a heart attack and kill her; the hormonal therapy is more important. I cannot agree with this. Zometa does a lot more than lower calcium, it decreases bone resorption and delays fractures. Any new fracture can kill mom. I don't know if they are right about it all. Mom really appears very fragile and she had heart problems before. But, we don't want to give up. What are the possible alternatives to bisphosphonates that can prevent fractures and treat her lytic lesions? Possibly, even vitamins or food supplements are better than nothing. Do you think Zometa is worth the risk? On Novartis website, they say Zometa is not an anti-cancer medicine. Thank you. Nataliya Log in to post a reply",

Her hand fracture has healed on its own and tamoxifen and zometa appear to work well on her mets. The doctors will do a surgery on her hand to prevent new fracture. However, they have completely ruled out a surgery on her femoral neck. They has been unable to stand for months due to the problem there. They say she has large hole there and the hip replacement would take an 8 hour surgery. They said it's too dangerous to do this at her age (63 years old). I am really scared how immobility will influence her general state of health. In the past, they were almost ready to give up treatment because she was very weak, had numerous presure ulcers and hardly moved. Since then, she really improved. I am also afraid of such a long surgery, but being able to move more will improve her chnaces in the long term. Is there anyone who did hip replacement surgery at this age with numerous bone mets? What is you opinion? Is it worth a try? Thank you. Nataliya Log in to post a reply",

They are not going to give her any chemo because she's very weak, has pressure ulcers and can't move a lot due to 2 fractures: hand and hip (femur). They will not finish her rads since it's hard and painful for her and it's only palliative. He said rads are only for pain, but they have already removed pain with morphines. However, on morphines she keeps sleeping and thus moves even less. He said they suspect metastases in liver, but can't scan since every scan is difficult for her, have to transport etc. He said we can just wait if tamoxifen and zometa will help, but prognosis is very bad. Please, help. Shall I push for chemo? Shall I ask to lower morphines and do the rads? What can I do? Log in to post a reply",

No biopcy of these was done. They doctors are convinced it's coming from her breast. They found a very small lump on the breast where she had a benigh lump 30 years ago (and had a surgery). However, histology showed it's benigh. There are no usual signs of inflammatory cancer either. They are now saying benign lump can give malignant metastases of the bone! Or it's still pre-cancerous. Is it possible? I'm really in pieces right now. I was told a CT scan can correctly show metastasis. I don't know whether to be happy that histology is negative (not cancer!) or upset (they can't find primary!). Please, give me some advice. Much apreciated. Log in to post a reply",
