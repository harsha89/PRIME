Have a shopping list started of all the things I will need to have on hand.  Most I wouldn't have even thought of.  I did think about the ginger snap cookies when someone mentioned ginger helped the stomach problems. Thought if I have a sore mouth I could always dunk them in my tea to soften them before eating them.  I think we are all amazing women for our strength in dealing with all of this.  I had my hair (have always worn a little below shoulders) cut to about 2 1/2 inches in preparation for the buzz cut. I have DR. appt. all week, tomorrow is a bone scan & staple removal from my mast. If they give me many more dates to remember I will need a secretary (HA  HA). My thoughts and prayers are with each and everyone of you fine women.",

Glad to have started.; 1down 7 to go.  Feel a little strange and have a slight headache but nothing I can't handle.  Am thankful that the treatments are available and just have to remind myself of that.  Will get a port put in on the 3rd of August as my onc nurse said they are afraid my veins wont hold up for all my Tx.  Good Luck and Best wishes to all.

Tomorrow ct scans and an echo gram.   Some days I feel so overwhelmed with all the decisions to be made does anyone else feel that way. I know all the decisions are personal choices but with so many I sometimes wonder if I am making the right ones like picc verses port.  Hopefully all will calm down when I start my chemo.  Bless each and everyone of you.",
