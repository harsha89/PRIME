I have gone through 6 rounds of chemo, and the lumpectomy, and now doing 20 rounds of radiation of which I have done 2 so far. Fear only robs you of the peace you need for healing. Fear banks on the unknown and uses it to entangle us and get us all bound up. Talk to your friends and family about your concerns and anxiousness about treatment and this blog will help you too. We can be an encouragement to you and a light to you in a dark place that is trying to overwhelm and overshadow you. I read a post from someone right before starting treatment that said she found it was a battle of relinquishing control of her life and being obedient and laying her will down. that spoke volumes to me before my first treatment. I have found my faith increased and my spirit uplifted because I have talked about what I am going through.",

I have 9 treatments in the book and tomorrow marks my halfway point. I have been putting the aloe vera on my underarm and slathering my right boob after treatment and before bed. I am feeling some tenderness but not sure if that is still nerves from my surgery 4 weeks before beginning rads. No pink skin or peeling yet. I was feeling very emotional yesterday. I think that is the hormonal response of a menopausal women going through a very BIG journey. Its ok to not feel ok with what you are going through. It is a huge life change to go through cancer treatment and we are allowed to have days where we just don't have the energy, physically or emotionally to say \"I've Got This\" so we share with our friends here and in our immediate circles and they can speak it for us, and carry us through those days. You are going to make it. This is just one moment in time on the time line of your life. There will be an end to it and you will come out the other side of the journey with your faith stronger, and your story to tell others who are starting their journeys. Love and prayers heading your way from sunny CA! ",

My support groups are all over the country. So many touched by BC and my Facebook posts about how I am doing. So glad to hear you have mighty prayer warriors too. While going through chemo I made Paracord bracelets for all of the people who were praying for me with a charm on them that said Pray or Faith on them to thank them for praying.

I have now finished all of my treatments as of last Thursday the 14th the week of my 60th birthday and the doctors are amazed that my skin looks so amazingly normal. just a hint of pink. It is extremely sensitive to the touch, and sore and I have had intense fatigue but that is all. I have been taking a whey protein supplement that boosts the cysteine in your cells that enable them to heal. I believe that has made a huge difference even in how I assimilated chemo. I hope that you have a good experience too. My faith has been strengthened and grown and I have found a confidence in sharing with people and making new friends that I never had before cancer.

I went through Chemo and worked full time all the way through and the side effects were manageable. Most that I talk to say this is easier. I think its that it is every single day that makes me dread it. At least with Chemo and infusions it was every 21 days. Would love some words from those who have been there. Angelsgal57",

I think that I have been so preoccupied with the what if's that I have imagined all the worst case scenarios and played them like videos in my head. Comes from my acting/directing theater background. I can visualize a lot and that is great when writing a script or directing an actor in a scene but not so good when facing things like this. I have to active an imagination for my own good. I hope that you have found it easy so far too. AngelsGal57",

Going through all the different treatments I forgot I am still a menopausal woman with female issues swirling around and there will be days that I am either angry at the world and my circumstances or miserably emotional and weak. That is why we are here on this site. We are all going through similar journeys and need each other to uplift and support us through prayer and stories and even funny stories. It all matters and it all helps. We are not alone. In that room I know that the machine is big, and noisy, BUT my God is bigger, and his spirit is there with us holding us close as we lay there feeling vulnerable. Be encouraged and lifted up. Today was #10 I am half way there. Angelsgal57",

I have two treatments left to go and I never thought I would get here....It has gone by so quickly in so many ways and even going every day has an extra benefit in that my husband and I have gotten closer as he has had to get up early and drive me to treatments and back. Such a blessing since it feels like he and I have done this final part together. For those of you just starting out, don't be afraid. I was NOT looking forward to this 20 treatment plan and the reassurance from the gals on this site has made a huge difference in how I have come along in the journey. We are definitely going through this TOGETHER! Even lying in that room with the big monster machine we can be comforted knowing that we are not alone. I found my trust in God deepened while I prayed and the machine hummed and did its thing. I have also found a lot of helpful advice and info from each of you who have gone before us... I only have 2 remaining treatments to go and have been blessed beyond measure by all of you and your being on this site with me. Stay strong, be encouraged and keep the faith! Angelsgal57",

I did radiation with no outward side effects but do have numbness of the rt breast tissue and soreness where the scar tissue is from the partial mastectomy. I did all of the prescribed treatments EXCEPT pharmaceutical hormone blockers and instead am on a herbal Pueraria Mirifica a plant derived hormone blocker. The only issues I am having with the Pueraria Mirifica are the typical PMS type symptoms such as hot flashes 2 - 3 times a day and wacky emotions. The down side is that rather than lasting a week during mensturation (When I used to have periods 6 years ago) It now lasts EVERY DAY. Some days are worse that others but because I know what is the cause it is manageable. I know that not everyone is on the band wagon regarding natural treatments yet I have done my homework and with a strong daily supplement routine am pretty much back to work and a normal life. I have a terrific wellness coach at the Cancer Treatment Center who is assisting me with getting my life back and it makes a huge difference. I have been walking 5 days a week for the last month and never thought that would happen. It is baby steps that are really making a difference. What are you doing now regarding your treatment?",
