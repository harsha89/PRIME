So when you say you are having this surgery with reconstruction at the same time...does this involve just your plastic surgeon or a gen surgeon and plastic surgeon at the same time? I would like to have the same thing done and will ask on Monday if it's possible in my area. Trying to figure all this out is so hard. I am considering bilateral just to take the worry out of having to go through all this again on the other side.",

I am right there with you about feeling overwhelmed with it all. However, today my outlook has been much better. Each day we survive is one step closer to being done. So we will take this one day at a time and do whatever works best for our bodies. I am going to get on Amazon to order myself some cortisone cream now because I can feel the itch coming. Two more days and we get a nice weekend break. Keep slathering the girls.",

Those days between the biopsy and results day are going to fly by and you will be getting your results before you know it. My GP gave me a prescription for ativan which has helped me a great deal in not laying awake at night letting my mind go to all the dark places. For me keeping busy during the day and taking the ativan at bedtime has been a saving grace. Someone on here told me when I first joined that all breast cancer is treatable. That fact has also given me a lot of relief from the fear. Take a deep breathe, it could be nothing and if it is something, it's so common that there are lots of treatments available.",

I started rads on October 11 and have had 17 treatments to date. 17 more to go. I will finish on Nov. 29. At first my breast became slightly pink and ached around my incisions. Now I have a more pink tone with and itchy rash underneath, between and above my breast. RO says this is where the beam is glancing off your skins rather than penetrating the tissue of the breast which makes perfect sense. I am using hydrocortisone cream, zinc oxide, aquaphor, calendula, alra and aloe at different times. Just keep slathering something on. It's not as bad as I imagine it would be. I get tired easily but nothing that you can't handle. Stay strong.",

Now struggling with fatigue from radiation, I get the spoon theory. I will pray for you Spoonie. PeeblesV, Ella is our spoiled rotten GSD baby. She was born here Feb 17, 2013 on a super cold 14 degree night. Her momma gave birth to her in her kennel out in our garage in those freezing temps. I went out to get something and heard a small whimper. Needless to say in they both came, the birthing blankets went down on the laundry room floor and by the next morning we had 4 beautiful pups. We chose to keep her and named her Ellament of Surprise since she was a surprise found in the garage. I miss her mom and dad so much since they both have since passed over the rainbow bridge. The boost today was a piece of cake. My regular treatments were 4 zaps if you will. The boost is 3. I still need to hold my breath for each zap and the last one they come in to turn the table at an angle. I am a little itchier in the boost area which is all around my lumpectomy incision. In my case that is at 12:00 on my right breast. For those of you just starting out, my breast started to get a bit pink the first week and I didn't feel fabulous either. I am not sure if was the rads or if I was just stressed over the whole process. I now have a very visible square area that surrounds my breast and goes well into my armpit. It looks tan and red, my DH says it looks like somebody that has been tanning a lot. Doesn't hurt to touch it in most places. Just this last week I have had my tan skin start rolling up and rubbing off just like any normal sunburned skin. The skin underneath is pink and tender. The pink tender areas are getting some extra attention in terms of pads to keep it from getting chaffed to much. Hugs to you all.",

My skin is holding up well considering it is various stages of red to purple with itchy bumps. My armpit and under my breast are the worst in terms of color. My chest above my breast is the most itchy. Under my breast and between my breast is where the itchy rash is. My RO, RN and the tech all say this is normal. The techs told me that open skin sores are rare. It does feel like a sunburn but is not as sensitive to touch as a sunburn. It itches like a sunburn. I have found that slathering often is key. I have a basket full of different lotions I am using. The aloe seems to help with the itching feeling so i use that at night. I like the aloe better than the hydrocortisone. The zinc oxide my RO swears by helps it heal, especially under and between where the rash is. I use that in the morning and after treatment. Sometime during the day I use a good moisturizing lotion, Alra, Calendula, etc. Aquaphor is too greasy for me. I tried wearing sports bras and bras without underwires but gave them up for my regular underwire bras. I like to wear what I am used to and what supports me best. I have not had a problem with the underwires. I hope this info helps. The fatigue struggle is real but nothing you can't handle. Listen to your body and adjust accordingly. It sucks we have to do this but the benefits outweigh the SEs, IMHO. Stay strong! Hugs to all. ",

Not an open wound but tender. A friend had given me some Cool Magic Clear Hydrogel Sheet Wound Dressing pads (3.75\" x 3.75\") she was given this summer when she had rads. These things are very soothing and feel like you put a nice cool new layer of skin on. Reminded me of how good Spoonie must have felt with her lasagna layering of gels and dressings. She said her center gave them to her. I am going to ask tomorrow if mine has them. The turkey is in the fridge. So looking forward to Thanksgiving with my family. Hugs to all! ",

I do have some stabbing pains occasionally but they are fleeting. At this time in my treatments I feel like I am gaining momentum. I feared I would burn, I feared I would be anxious in there with the big scary machine, I feared the fatigue would kick my butt. At this point, even if I do burn and I am tired, I know I am going to come out on the other side of this with a significant benefit from having had these treatments. So stay strong, you are going to get through this one day at a time. I would also like to share with you all that my grandmother had breast cancer in the late 1940's or early 50's. She had a radical mastectomy and radiation. She lived a long and full life from Jan 1903 - Dec 2002. Yes, that's right, she was one month from her 100th birthday when she passed.

My sister and i whipped up some homemade body butter with baby lotion, vaseline, coconut oil, vitamin E. I have been using some of that along with my other lotions. I think that has helped with softening the skin. The fatigue was kicking my butt so I was very curious to see how 4 days off would help with that.

After two treatments the fatigue came back but I am optimistic after the treatments end my energy will be coming back fairly quickly.

I was afraid I didn't have enough spoons in my hand to finish the job. I love the spoon theory, thank you for sharing it. I hope your rash clears up and you start feeling better soon. Ghostie, hang in there. My Ro said the rads will remove any remaining fluids in the breast from the surgery.

The team I have run the \"Beach\" machine and have been amazing in making me feel comfortable. There are 3 rads machines where I am going, each with a different theme. At first I thought I would be freaked out but in reality it was over so quickly that I didn't have much time to think about it. I am getting four zaps for about 20 seconds each. I am doing 34 visits but I am told some of those they will be taking xrays with no rads so I am not sure my total whole breast treatments. 6 at the end will be boosts to the tumor bed. I noticed that my nipple looked paler than it did before right after the treatment but the color has come back now. I am slathering it with Alra cream and another aloe cream for sun. The RO gave me some lidocaine cream for later in case I need to numb it a bit. For me the best way to get through this is by not overthinking it as I push on and power through it. Eat, drink, sleep, repeat. As long as I can do those three main things I can survive the rest. I am one of the fortunate ones that had the cancer detected early with a mammogram. I hadn't had one in 4 years. The magnitude of that blows me away. I am in awe of all the women who walk this path having to do chemo, surgery, and radiation, all the while juggling their families, work and life. We are so much stronger than we think we are. My RO told me to hold off on the arimidex until after my rads treatments are over. Anyone else have that recommendation? My coworkers created a message board for me to bring home to check off the days. Sweet little notes of encouragement and gift cards too. I am also wearing special tee shirts on Fridays to give me something to look forward to. I am also trying to think of a fun thing to give my rads team on Halloween. Do share what you are doing.

My center works me in as soon as I get there since we are also driving 45 minutes and traffic is hit or miss. Consider the treatment could very well save you from having a recurrence which could save your life. Work around the treatments as best you can. You can always work when you are well.

It sound like you have caught it very early so you know that is good news. I had an MRI last night and know exactly how you are feeling. However, my surgeon said he wanted it to check on my nodes and to make sure I didn't have any other spots that needed to be looked at closer with an ultrasound. I am looking at this test as a good thing since it's better to know these things now rather than missing them altogether or finding something out after or during surgery. So try not to worry too much about the results because it will all be helpful in helping determine your treatment. Hang in there and keep us posted on how you are doing.",

      "Content": "Oct 16, 2018 09:12PM - edited Oct 16, 2018 09:13PM by CarolAnnieLumpLump Today I had treatment 4/34. So far I have noticed that my lumpectomy incision is sore which I found surprising since they had been doing great. The skin around my lumpectomy incision is turning pink where I had a reaction to the tape after surgery. My stomach is a little off, I have noticed it feels much better if I keep a little something in it. Today I snacked on a few crackers etc and it helped. The most annoying SE I have is that it has made my tinnitus (ringing in my ears) so much worse. I haven't seen anyone else post about this but it is driving me crazy. It could very well be related to fatigue. I have noticed before if I am very tired it is worse. I do feel tired but don't know if it's the stress of this new routine and the daily worry that your going to end up a burning hot mess or the radiation. I wasn't expecting any side effects for a couple weeks at least. I have been slathering up with Alra cream and think I will try some of the aquafor they gave me tonight. I took my seam ripper and removed the underwires from one of my more comfortable bras, so far it is working well. This is such an emotional journey we are on. I was struggling a little the first couple days. We are all such brave souls. Stay strong ladies and be easy on yourselves. xo ",

Hoping your throat doesn't get too painful for you. Maybe you should be eating popsicles and ice cream. Greenharbor, I am over cancer treatments already too. Can not wait to get all this behind us. My husband is over it too even though he doesn't say anything. I know he is tired of talking about it with everyone we see and driving me everyday to my appointments.  ",

I was trying to do the math on that to see how old he is. haha. Anyway, he told me the creams to use are zinc oxide for healing, hydrocortisone for itching and any cream that has lidocaine in it for pain relief. I haven't used any of them yet since yesterday I had treatment #7 and I am only a little pink around my incision. They also gave me some aquaphor and another kind of gel lotion. I am using the Alra cream twice daily for now. My friend said she had a crusty couple layers of skin peel off around her nipple toward the end of her treatments. There was new skin underneath so it wasn't a big deal she said. We all just need to take this treatment plan one day at a time and take it easy on ourselves. Sometimes the hardest thing is to say no but at a time like this we need to take care of ourselves first whenever possible. Enjoy the weekend break everyone!",
