I was able to get in the next day with a ARNP at my Gynecologists office because my Gyno was not in the office that day.  After giving me a thorough breast exam she did not think it was anything serious but scheduled me for an ultrasound just to be sure. She diagnosed me with a possible lipoma and after researching it on Google, it does sound like that could be what it is. Well, after being on and off the phone for about 2 hours today I finally got an appointment for Wednesday afternoon. When I called she said I won't be getting an ultrasound after all but a baseline mammogram since I am 30 years old? She said the radiologist will look at it and if they see anything they will do any ultrasound as well. I guess. I'm just sorta worried about all this. I know that it is actually going well, and I'm lucky I was able to get an appointment so soon but I am just not looking forward to it. I still have that thought in the back of my mind that it could be cancer.Anyone ever diagnosed with a lipoma after just a breast exam that turned out to be cancer? Thanks for reading. -Erin Log in to post a reply",

Aren't screening mammograms used to see if there is anything? I've already found a lump on my breast. Plus, I'm 30 and everything I've read indicates that my breast tissue is too dense for them to read it.  Anyone ever have a mammo and an ultrasound done on the same day?",

Yeah, I'm really hoping they can do both because I just don't trust a mammogram to show everything especially because I have very small, dense breasts. I'm just confused because she made it sound like that was exactly why they were gonna do an ultrasound instead but while making the appointment the lady mentioned a mammogram. I'll guess have to wait and see what they are going to do. I might call back before my appointment to get some confirmation on the tests they'll be doing. Thanks again for your response, it's much appreciated.  Erin",
