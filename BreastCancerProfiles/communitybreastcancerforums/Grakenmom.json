Happy New Year to all!! Gcarter - loved your poem! Mind if I plagiarize? because you said very well almost exactly what I would have said if I could have! Cakeisgreat - my bilat mx with TE's was 11/11, and the pain was not too bad immediately after surgery. Just be sure to let your surgeon(s) and nurses know when you need something - \"stay ahead of the pain\" were the words my nurse used. And, if memory serves, you're not supposed to do anything for the first 4 weeks or so, no lifting, pushing, carrying more than 10 lbs, and no lifting elbows past shoulder-height (like you could anyway!). Your surgeon should prescribe plenty of pain meds for when you return home - keep a timed log of your meds (antibiotics & pain meds), because logic and memory become quite fuzzy at 2 or 3 am when you need another pill! Congrats on your decision - you'll do great!  -and please pm me if I can be of any help. I've discovered that I should have been doing more shoulder exercises when cleared by my PS after about 6-7 weeks - I'm having some pain & stiffness from lack of use, but I am now determined to get my strength and mobility back. And thankfully, only minor SE's from the Tamoxifen.  2010 is already starting out great!! Health and happiness to you all, xo - E",

Also a cafeteria there, but pretty expensive for the food). The Astronaut Hall of Fame is also very cool - big, interactive-type displays toward the end of the \"museum\" - much cooler than I would have thought. If you're a AAA member, you can purchase discount tickets in advance - saved us $$ at KSC and Disney. And, Cocoa Beach is about a 10-minute drive past KSC - go out on the Pier, it's pretty cool. (Sorry, can't recall the names) but happy to hear of the tests and those who are all clear - great news! Sullykm - I've been on Tamox for about 2 months and have only slight side effects (altho my husband might disagree!)  Feel a little disjointed, mentally, can't find the right word in conversations, and am a little forgetful (SO not like me, usually), but I'll deal with it - it's still better than cancer.  Thought I would go back on my antidepressant, but after reading some here and doing a little research, it seems that some ad's inhibit Tamox's effectiveness, and increase the risk of recurrence from about 7% to about 13% - I'm just not willing to take that chance, so I'll be exercising more & taking fish oil! Best to you all, and Meece, I'd love some spaghetti tree seeds if you could manage it :) xo, E",

Apparently taking it for less than 5 years decreased the benefit, and taking it for over 5 years showed no increased benefit.  (It's been a while since I've looked this up, so please don't take this info to the bank, for some reason it just stuck in my head).  So, the \"need\" for Tamox is, of course, individual, if you're willing to deal with any se's for the decreased recurrence risk.
