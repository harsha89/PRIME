The waiting is definitely the worst. I am on anti anxiety meds and also have Ativan when I feel really panicky. The meds really help, so I would recommend that to any person just newly diagnosed who are feeling anxious. Cindy (Murphy)",

Youngish and with children. Just had surgery and waiting for the test results. I am scared, just like you. I too have other findings which lead me to believe I have mets (I have difficulty eating). I look at my children and cry everyday. I am ashamed at my response to this, I felt I was strong, but in the face of adversity, I am not. I am really, really scared. I know what you are going through. Ladies who have replied to this post, you are incredibly strong women. Thank you for your posts, they have also helped me. Still scared though.....",

I had a lumpectomy July 7 before I knew my receptor status and also just found out that they did not get all of the cancer. The margins were positive. And so I sit here and wait. I have been waiting for weeks. It seems all of the breast surgeons and oncologists in Calgary are on vacation. It is just so frustrating. I am going crazy with worry and have thoughts of mets running around my body. My lump was 3.2 cm, grade 3. My sentinel node was positive. This is crazy. Is anyone else experiencing the same thing? ",
