My RO is very adamant that I use nothing but the cream he will give me to use. I think he is just older and set in his ways... I have read so many posts regarding EMU oil and quite frankly am considering going against his advise and using it as well as the cream he gives. I am allergic to cortisone creams so is there any others I can use for itching that do not contain cortisone? What brand of EMU is best and which is better oil or cream? Thanks in advance!
