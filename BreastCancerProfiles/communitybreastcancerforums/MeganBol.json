Today I went to have my targeted ultrasound and biopsy (showed on MRI that I had last week) and the bugger didn't present itself so now I have to wait until next week for an MRI guided biopsy. It's wonderful to have a forum to speak with others going through same thing. I have been taking it one day at a time (sometimes 10 minutes at a time), praying that I find the strength to handle whatever is in front of me, taking deep breaths and refocusing when I feel panic and anxiety and keeping myself busy. It's 12:50 and I just finished scrubbing my floors, twice!! LOL, believe me, I haven't done that in a while, I think my adrenaline is in overdrive. Sending positive thoughts your way. MegBol ",
