I am from NC.  In 2004, he spoke at my daughter's high school -- she interviewed him for the school paper.  He was great with the teenagers.  Catherine and her friends actually campaigned for him for a bit (I love how politically active this generation is now!) He gave many of us hope and inspiration.  We were so proud of him -- and proud that he was a NC (Tarheel) son.  And his family just seemed like our own.... Elizabeth was diagnosed with cancer about a year before me.  And her recurrence came just before my own.  She was and is a great model for me.  I truly admire how she has battled her disease openly, right there with the rest of us. It is difficult for me to judge others, even more so now that I have recurrent breast cancer.  I am very, very disappointed to be sure.  I respect their privacy and mourn for the horrible losses their family has suffered.  Of course John can never be a candidate again.  Perhaps God will lead him to other things.  I can not fathom why he felt compelled to go on national television and talk to Bob Woodward about this affair.  Did he feel a need to explain it to us?; Get it off his chest?, Some kind of repentance??  A morbid need to be in the spotlight again??  My own opinion is the TV admission served no purpose, except to hurt his family further -- although I am sure he did not intend that.  I think this is a tragedy.  A family tragedy first and foremost but also a tragedy to the many people who trusted, supported, and dared to hope that a talented, ambitious Tarheel could really help this world.  I hope and pray that the Edwards family recovers and finds happiness again.  Jesus said hate the sin -- not the sinner. ",

I will try and start.... 1st diagnosis - May 2005. Age 46. Stage 2A, 1.2 cm IDC, ER,PR -, Her2+, sentinel lymph node positive, other 20 removed negative. Right side mastectomy - no immediate reconstruction. Mild lymphodema. 8 rounds of dose dense chemo with all the side effects. One year of hercepten.(Yikes -- this does not sound very positive!) And It gets worse before it gets better.... Getting ready for reconstruction in August 2006 -- had a routine scan.  Found .4 cm single  nodule in left lung.  Thought the end was here for sure!  But they operated, removed it, and gave me 12 weeks of taxol/hercepten and been on hercepten ever since.  Was NED for 2 great years -- no side effects from hercepten. Mammogram in March, 2008 was clear. But in July, 2008, had a scan -- all clear EXCEPT.. a new primary in the left breast.  Small, less than a cm., so just had another mastectomy.  Did really well.  It is stage 1, grade 1 -- much less aggressive this time, Her2neg. and ER+.  They compared the slides from both breasts and they are indeed totally different cancers.  No chemo needed this time.  Will be on Arimidex for 5-10 years. Not sure why I feel positive.  When I look back at this story it sounds terrible!  But -- the good news is the Hercepten IS working so far.  No new metastatic disease since 2006.  The new primary breast cancer is pretty mild.  I feel totally healthy and recovered beautifully from all surgeries. Guess I have just learned to live with this as part of my life.  It horrifies other people more than it does me.  The truth is, I am in much better shape than most of my friends! Still -- I could easily be very inspired by hearing others who have gone longer than 2 years NED on Hercepten!  Where are those 2-10% who do well for a long time?  Would looove to hear from you!  I believe positive thoughts are enormously helpful and are at the very least a lot more fun!
