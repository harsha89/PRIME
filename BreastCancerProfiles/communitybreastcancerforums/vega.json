But then I explained that it felt thicker to me when compared to my other breast and regardless of what she tought it was it shouldn't be hurting for 8 months. She felt again and told me it was probably just inflammed cartilage and to take some motrin. I have another appointment there in a month so she said if it still hurt then we could check it out again and maybe do further diagnostics.   I am happy that it doesn't seem to worry her at all but I am still concerned that she just seemed to brush it off so much. There is definitely something there and it definitely hurts. Not saying it's cancer (because I highly doubt it) but I just feel like something that has been like this for so long probably won't just go away with the motrin. It might help for pain but I don't think it will solve the problem and I want the problem SOLVED.  Log in to post a reply",
