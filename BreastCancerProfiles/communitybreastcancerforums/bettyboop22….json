I read your message and could have wrote it myself...strange.  I am also a nurse and also very scared for my mom.  She had calcifications found on her mammogram and now meets with the surgeon on Friday regarding biopsy.  I'm going to post my own message because I need some support and a little piece of mind.  I just wanted to wish your mom the best!!!  Take care!",
