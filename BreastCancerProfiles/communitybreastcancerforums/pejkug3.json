I don't know why I'm having such a visceral response to this part of my treatment. I've been cut and poisoned for 18 weeks and went through that ok. But this burning portion of treatment really ticks me off. Maybe because I have to be 1/2 naked in front of strangers everyday until August 19th. Maybe it's because I have to go to the doctor everyday between now and August. Maybe I'm just tired of this. It started on January 5th and I'm ready to be done with it. (Am I ever really done though?) Maybe the thought of burning my skin on purpose is just hard to absorb. None of those are helped by an office staff that won't give me a schedule because I \"don't have a job\". So they want to tell me today when I should come in tomorrow making it impossible to schedule anything ahead of time. One day I'm to be there at 2pm, the next at 8:45am, the next at 3:30pm, etc. Plus, I have other appts at the hospital to work around so I could be out to the hospital 3 different times next Friday. All because I \"don't have a job\" and should be more flexible. (Part of the issue there is that I am by FAR the youngest person I have seen in the cancer center. The older people are retired and much older and don't have to work around family and 4 kids. My plan is to tell them that I'm going back to \"work\" so I'll need a standing appt. time) So yesterday, they had me strip off my top and bra with 4 techs in the room...um, oookkkkk. No privacy at all, I guess. The simulation was suppoed to take 30 minutes. They ran the machine and it marks my fields. I have seven fields. The fields fit together like a puzzle and cover from the middle of my chest, all the way to the back of my ribcage from my collarbone to 2 inches below the bra line. Then the proceed to draw all over my chest with black sharpie to mark the fields for the radiation oncologist (RO) to approve. He comes in to look and says, \"No, I want the isocenter over here\". So all the markings get wiped off and the start over. He approves that plan and they zap me for the first time. I was getting dressed - in front of everyone - to leave and they tell me, \"Oh, no. You can't wear a bra until you're all through with radiation and your skin recovers.\" I had to argue to wear my bra out of the hospital! Plus, I was supposed to leave the black markings that went clear up my NECK on until tomorrow when they'll do more tattoos. (I had three tattoos done last week and I thought that was it - guess not.) Well, I can tell you that most of the black sharpie marks are gone just from clothing rubbing on them and sweating. But for $906 - they can mark them again. The RO was great. He sat with me and went through all the technical parts of my plan. Initially, he wasn't sure I would be able to do radiation because he believed my heart would be in the way. He thought he would be hitting 27% of my heart, but my heart is positioned a bit differently than he thought it would be. He's only hitting 2% of it with this plan. But he's getting more of my lung (18%) so I should anticipate some pleurisy issues, a cough and fluid on my lung that will resolve once radiation is done. I figure that people live with one lung so I should be just fine. I guess I like the doctor, but I don't like the staff. And my appt should have been 30 minutes lying in a hard plastic form, with your arm over your head and your neck turned to one side, unable to move. And it was 75 minutes. Just crabby. But better today. Today shouldn't be so long. And I may request privacy to change clothes. I know, I know - after all this time, I shouldn't care. But I do. Even at the GYN then give you privacy to get changed and settled. Not here though... Ugh. I'm sorry for whining. I guess I'm just weary. I kept remining myself yesterday that as frustrating as this experience is - it's better than cancer. I'd really like to be alive when my kids become adults and have their own lives. And this inconvenience is worth it to get me to that point. I'm sure I'll settle into a routine and this will be ok. But I have such strong pre-appt.anxiety. Radiation goes until August 19th - and the kids start school on August 22nd.  I'd like a semi set schedule so I can plan to do some things with my kids, you know?  ",

Barb58 - I'm finding this whole process a bit humiliating as well.  I don't know why rads upsets me so much!  I was scared before chemo, but I wasn't MAD. The receptionist asked me if I was settling into a routine today.  I didn't know how to answer her!  I still hate this with every fiber of my being.  NO - it's not routine. I think I may be sinking into a depression.  It's been a LONG year (for all of us!) and I just need a vacation.  Oh, yeah - I can't go on vacation...I'm teather to a machine everyday for the rest of summer.  *sigh* I've been fighting the desire to quit and take my chances.  But I think those feelings are being driven by my 4 continually fighting kids and the fatigue that has built from all this medical stuff.  I fantasize about when the kids go back to school, but then the hectic fall schedule kicks in.  And I need to hit the ground running for that.

And who knows, this week could be rough and undo everything.  But I'm claiming victory for today!!  Lena - When I post treatment numbers, I post treatments completed/total treatments.  I think that's what everyone else is doing, too.  I hope your appt this afternoon goes well!",

I was told to stay out of the sun and no swimming on chlorinated pools (too drying).  My RO said to avoid sun exposure because the skin is and organ even though most people don't treat it as such.  And since it's being assaulted during rads, go easy on additional sun exposure. So far (14/33), rads hasn't been horrible to me.",

You can imagine how this is going over with me while in rads.  We have four young-ish kids (14, 12, 7 & 7) who are active and messy.  ;)  The oldest is starting HS this year and has cheerleading practice 3xs a week right now and the youngest are ALL boy.  All three of them.  Between the fighting, driving and general life - PLUS rads - I'm beat.  My DH is great at keeping up on laundry and stuff like that, but he doesn't really seem to want to hear about how fatigued I am from rads and all the junk of this year. I'm a bigger wimp that some of the ladies on thsi thread because I cannot imagine working on top of everything else.  Maybe that's why DH gets so short with me.  But sometimes I wish the \"only\" thing I had to do was go to work and come home.  Yeah, I'm whining.  (But I'm entitled to a little bit...  ) I have a friend who is moving this week - and she changed her moving day to Friday night.  That's the night of Relay for Life here.  I was tentatively thinking about going to Relay for Life.  (What is it anyhow?  I feel a little strange wearing a survivor tshirt and taking the survivor lap...what else do they do?)  But I feel guilty not helping my friend move. The same friend needs help painting at the new house on Wednesday...that's 26/33 for me and I just cannot imagine painting with my underarm blisters and no bra.  Ugh.  But she's SO good to me - watches my kids whenever I need her, arranged for a ton of meals to be brought in during chemo - how can I say no?  But I'm so beat and just drained. I don't know how to be normal.  I don't know how to move from active treatment to a post-cancer world.  But I have a feeling that I don't have long to figure it out...",

Mammalou, you're in the heart of rads right now?  Anyone else have AND and rads?",

I had the dye injected and that lit up the Sentinal Nodes (SN) .  My surgeon took those and the quick test in surgery said I was node negative.  But since the other nodes were so HUGE, he elected to take those as well.  Both SN remained negative in complete pathology, but there was cancer in another node further down the chain.  Wierd... I've had some crazy thoughts about all this...what if...just, what if my immune system was attacking this cancer and it was on its way out of my body.  Yeah, I know this line of thought isn't rational, but what is rational about cancer?  What if my tiny 0.5cm cancer was actually being attacked by my immune system and my body was winning? I was under a LOT of stress in the years before diagnosis.  Our daughter had drown, our finances were a mess, we had twins....it was a LOT of stress.  And I had been seriously depressed and not caring for myself at all. In the year before diagnosis, I started taking care of myself, I had recovered from depression and we were moving on with life.  I briefly entertained the thought that since I was giving my body the right tools to deal with illness, it was healing itself and that's why the cancer wasn't in the SN but further down the chain - it was on it's way out. Crazy?  Meh, who knows.  All I know is that I'm doing everything I can and praying everyday that this is the only time I pass by this life event.  I want God to use it in my life to make me more aware and more empathetic to those with physical problems.  I certainly see things differently now.  And that tiny needling Voice within me is what lead me to diagnosis to begin with. I'm rambling...I should be sleeping.  :)",
