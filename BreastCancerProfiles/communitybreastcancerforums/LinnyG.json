So good that you have a surgeon that you have a relationship and who you trust. What are you doing for yourself in the meantime? Do you work? Getting some exercise? I swim almost every morning and it is my meditation...and medication. And doing weights with a trainer. If I didn't, I find myself wanting to hibernate and I don't want to do that! I will be thinking of you Friday. Please let me know how it goes.",

My question, I guess, is that it seems like the minimal blood flow contradicts the spiculatd descripion - thoughts? This waiting is tough! Log in to post a reply",

Option 2 - lumpectomy but since the sites are not together, a fairly large amount of breast tissue would be excised, too much to re-build. Plastic surgeon will evaluate. Will keep you posted. How are you doing?",

Thursday I had first fill of 60cc. PS put 350 in a surgery. Felt fine until Friday night. Left shoulder, specifically, my deltoid muscle really started to hurt. Took ibuprofen, but it woke me throughout the night. Today is a bit better. Anyone else have that experience? Maybe I slept on it wrong? I don't know, but it hurt! Otherwise all good. No pectoral muscle cramping. 3 more fills - last one 11/8. Wait 4 wks then exchange and reduction/lift of right side. And go the call on Thursday that my Oncotype score was 2, so thankfully, no chemo. Feels like I can see an end to this.",
