I have just completed the halfway mark with Abraxane and avistan and have 9 more treatments to go.  I had a PET Scan Tuesday and the results today were negative, or no activity.   They still see the 8 mm lesion on my spine T8 vertebrae but it was not active.  Don't know at this point what the future holds for me, but no activity sounds pretty good to  me.",
