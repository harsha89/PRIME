I had the wire guided biopsy, and I really didn't feel a thing.  It felt a little strange, but probably just from me *knowing* that it was there.  You'll be fine!   As for the cell phone - they don't allow cell phone use at our hospital.  I was in my gown though, and they made me very comfortable in a recliner :)  I listened to my ipod until it was time to go.  All in all, I was treated well and it was a positive experience.

Just my two cents...I topped out at 237 lbs. in January of 2008 (my highest weight).  I had gained 40 lbs after my bc dx (2 1/2 years ago).  I joined LAWL, which is just a really expensive way of learning to eat correctly, portion sizes and the right foods etc.  I've now lost 54 lbs. - I'm thinner than I was pre-bc dx I do some biking and kayaking, but I also walk about 20 mins. every day at a fair pace (not too slow, not too fast).  It has positively melted off of me, with not a whole lot of effort. It has been a complete life change for me (my dx)...I've lost weight, I feel great, I bought a mountain bike and today...TODAY I bought my own KAYAK!!  Woo hoo!!
