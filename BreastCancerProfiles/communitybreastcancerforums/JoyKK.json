Here goes: Since my final round of chemo, I've had a lot of swelling (edema) of my arms and legs.  I've consulted with a lymphedema specialist and there's some fear I have early lymphedema in my left arm, where 9 nodes were removed.  Right now, I'm not so worried about that because my left arm isn't very swollen and it looks very much like my right arm. Plus I have a compression sleeve and glove, and I've learned how to wrap my arm too.  BUT, here's what is bothering me:  My feet, ankles, and thighs look like I'm 10 months pregnant and my weight is up by about 8 pounds -- about 5 pounds in the last week or two.  I'm on a diuretic but it seems to be doing no good. Are any of you experiencing similar symptoms?  Any thoughts on how to get rid of the swelling, which is unattractive and uncomfortable?  The oncologist's nurse said I could perhaps go on a stronger diuretic, and I'm wondering if that would make a difference.  I assume the weight -- from water mostly, I think, and perhaps some from overeating -- will come off eventually.  But how long is eventually? Looking forward to any advice you can offer. Big thanks in advance, Katherine  ",

Here's my query for you all. I finished chemo (six rounds of taxotere, carboplatin, and herceptin) five weeks ago and I'm feeling slowly but surely stronger and stronger. My tastebuds are back and my energy is up. But, the side effect I'm still struggling with is water retention. I continue to have significant swelling in my feet, legs, arms, and hands (less in my torso and face, I think). Diuretics have done little good. Acupuncture has done little good. I'm told this is a reaction to the taxotere. I think I had a little water retention during chemo (it's hard to distinguish weight gain from fat vs. water, at least at first), but I've had a lot since the end of chemo, and it's going away super slowly.   Do any of you have experience with this? Is there anything I can do to reduce the water retention / edema? I'm exercising quite a lot, drinking plenty of fluids, and not eating a lot of salt. Thanks very much! Katherine",

Hoping you all are findings moments of joy and satisfaction.  Chemo is so tough and I so identify with the comments about one's appearance.  We're coming back, we're coming back, we're coming back.  But, at least for many of us, it's clear we don't quite look and feel like \"ourselves\" yet.

Here's the link to the story and video: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/10/AR2011011006036.html Please do let people know that, in many, many cases, it is possible to safely keep one's hair during chemo.  Keeping my hair has made my cancer journey more tolerable than it would otherwise have been.  I wish you all -- and me too -- good luck, resilience, and good health during this tough and continuing journey.  Thanks and best wishes,    Katherine PS.  By the way, I was chewing ice during chemo too -- to prevent mouth sores and other side-effects to my mouth.  That's why my voice sounds funny when I was speaking on video during chemo.)  ",

I also identify with comments about the psychological experience of the end of chemo.  Many friends have said to me, \"You must be soooo happy to have chemo over.\"  But, the reality has been much more complex and nuanced.... In the three weeks since my final chemo, I've felt a great deal of sadness, compassion, emotional exhaustion, fear, sensitivity, gratitude, curiosity about what's next, and more.  Many of the emotions I've held at bay over the past 6 months have emerged more strongly.  When I welcome them and accept them, I feel better than when I either deny them or obsess about them.  And I'm feeling more and more positive as time goes on.  I just attended a five-day meditation retreat -- totally a new thing for me.  That's helped too.

I've been fairly lucky and experienced relatively few, relatively mild side-effects during chemo but the end of chemo has hit harder.  I can certainly identify with others' comments about feeling weak and getting out of breath when I exercise (even climbing gentle hills or taking two flights of stairs), but the side effect I'm finding even more bothersome and worrisome is the considerable swelling of my arms and legs.  I saw a lymphedema specialist who was worried about the swelling of my left arm, where 9 nodes were removed.  I got a compression sleeve and glove and learned to wrap my arm at night.  I'm now much less worried about lymphedema.  IF I have it, it seems -- at least right now -- very manageable, as my left arm looks almost exactly the same as my right arm.   But, my legs and feet are really swollen.  My feet look like I'm ten months pregnant.  My legs are thicker and the muscles are less visible than I think I've ever seen them.  When I weighed myself, my weight was up at least six pounds in the last week (and nearly ten pounds total since the start of chemo).  My weight has been very stable for decades, so this is really out of (body) character.  I'm wondering how much of this weight is water retention and what I can do to get rid of the swelling as it makes my feet hurt and makes my legs so heavy and it looks unattractive, especially to me, I know.  The diuretic I've been prescribed seems to do very little good. I'll see my oncologist later this week, but I'm afraid he'll just say, \"Oh, it's a chemo side-effect that will go away eventually....\" Have you experienced similar side-effects?  Have you found anything that reduces the swelling? Big, big thanks in advance for your comments!  Katherine    ",
