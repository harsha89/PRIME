    "Content": "Gloro wrote: I suffer from costochondritis and had a flare up this past Monday.  Saw dr. and was told to take Naproxen.  On Wednesday my left breast started to hurt.  The Naproxen I take for the costochondritis helps a bit with the pain.  My breast is still very tender, painful and feels heavy. I don't feel any lump. My right breast feels fine. I've had the mirena IUD for 2 years and no longer get periods so it's hard for me to say if this is cyclical pain. Trying to get an appointment with my dr.  Any advice? Log in to post a reply",
