I really feel finished now. My treat to myself for finishing everything was to have my eyeliner tattooed when I had my nipples done and now when I get out of the swimming pool, I've got liner on. The nipple recon was the only procedure that I felt ok about and am so very glad I did it  Henny ",

None of us, including the oncs really know if \"wait and see\" works but waiting in silence or even screaming for 6 week isn't good for anyone.We just have to know what we're dealing with before we can deal with it. This has been a really lousy week for you but even though we are in cyberspace you are surrounded by loving and caring arms Henny",

I have been working in imaging for 25 years. When I started doing bone scans I never saw a scan that got better. My jaw nearly went to my toes a couple years ago when I saw for the first time a woman with breast cancer whose bone mets  got better. Now I often see women who have no visable mets on followup scans. The drugs really can work. Let's hope that your mother responds well to treatment and has good scans in the future Henny",
