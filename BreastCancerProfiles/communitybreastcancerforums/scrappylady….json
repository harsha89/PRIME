Big appt. today, meeting w/radiation oncologist to see if I need radiation at all. I will start tamoxifen as soon as I open the bottle & swallow the first pill; medical oncologist reviewed pathology reports, etc. and felt that in my case (caught early, no node involvement, clean margins, etc.) it may be managable w/out radiation...this could be huge for me, as I also have muscular dystrophy and was panicking about the possibility of fatigue w/radiation. Just remember to be an advocate for yourself & follow your gut. Initially all thought I could get by w/6 month mammogram f/u after microcalciications see on yearly mammo. My mom had dealt w/DCIS 3 years ago so I pushed for biopsy and SO glad I did as it was caught so early. Keep us posted on your appointments and progress and remember this board is a Godsend.",
