I chose not to have the 6 rounds of chemo since the risks outweighed the benefits. My infection is still in the breast and the open wound will take another month to heal. I feel confident with such a small tumor, stage 1 and bilateral mastectomy I have taken the correct approach.",

I have lined up pillows and tucked pillow under my left arm which is still swollen. Lots of fluid drains to side boobs while laying down. It has gotten easier since drains have been removed, Side sleeping is impossible with much pain and left arm pain. DRAINS - DRAINS HURT - Dec 1 - 2 drains were placed during BMX surgery SHOULD HAVE BEEN 4 since I was very large breasted. Another problem caused by board certified surgeon. Left drain where cancer was NEVER drained any fluid. Left breast was full of fluid which just swooshed around. Right drained thick blood for days and days. My hemoglobin levels dropped and I needed 2 blood transfusion during first 5 day hospital stay. Infection at suture line formed on day 2. Dec 10 - (was suppose to be my reconstruction surgery day but infection stopped this). Thank God PS performed surgery to drain infection, reposition drains and added 2 more. Drains became active and the healing began, Drains are painful. They get more painful as the days go by since they become cumbersome. I was so happy the day before Xmas when my last 2 drains were removed. It was freeing to me. ENERGY - Since losing blood first week and infection and IVs the next week, I am just now healing and getting my energy back. I become winded easily and dr. appts are about the big activity of the day. I have grocery shopped a few times and each time I feel like I need to sit down at the end. My sister has been my helped and has lifted everything for me. I am trying to walk each day a few houses on the block to try and build me energy. SPIRITS - I am a 53 yr old divorced women with a 14 yr old daughter. I am very strong and independent but must admit this has been hard on me. I was limited to do anything in Dec including decorated my home. Not driving till last week was also hard since my teenager has many activities. My sister moved in with me to help and has been a godsend but I am experiencing the blues. The look of my breasts after infection and 2 surgeries are horrid. Like a shark attack. I will be asking dr for a mild anti depressant to take the edge off. LYMPEDONEMA - I believe I am developing this in my left arm. Upper arm is swollen where lymph nodes were removed. I am exercising every day and can lift my arms completely and side to side with little pain. The nerve cut in my left arm is where most of the swelling is. Trying to exercise and lift arms frequently to stretch the muscles and move the fluid around. I will be finding out the results of the ONCO DX test today and figure out if chemo will be necessary or just hormone therapy.",

My shoulder aches and turning or re-positioning my pillow can be painful. Last night did not sleep much and watched tv and today went to car repair to drop off car and went to walmart to shop. I was gone 2 hours and I got home and just crashed on couch/recliner. Winded and exhausted. I am hoping each day I get my mojo back since I am not used to being this way.  ",

I was planning on getting permanent implants without having to do Tissue expanders but now will need to re-arrange in 6 months Sadly, I will now need tissue expanders since the rest of my skin is shrinking and will need to be stretched with expanders and filled with saline. I am so fearful of another infection! Good luck with your reconstruction I wish you the best. Anyone have swollen side boobs? I have side boobs now since the skin was trying to be saved. I am getting used to the extra bumps under my arm but today I feel like both sides are big. Both sides have flabby bumps but today I feel very swollen and my left arm is swollen. I did a lot yesterday. Do you think this is from coming over working it. Went food shopping and although I thought I did not lift anything heavy, I think I overdid.",

Now I have a lot of skin and side boobs that are starting to shrink and hardened around the incision area. It is causing a lot of pain. When I stand or walk the weight of the remaining skin and fat pulls and is uncomfortable. My PS says it is normal but sometimes it is very painful and flares up. My left breast is getting better every day and infection is clearing but is still painful. Anyone else getting pain by scars?",

My left drain was not draining and my whole left side sounded like a water balloon. My surgeon was not concerned and paid little to no attention to me after surgery. Will never recommend this Board certified surgeon in St Pete FL or will not be doing any followup treatment with him. When a surgeon leaves a patient waiting for 6-9 hours each day in the hospital to drop by and give his opinion on what to do next and he never once looks at the wound or unbandage the area, that is a problem. Dec 10th - surgery to drain infection, open up wound and staples area was performed by my PS. Thank God my PS was the one who took care of me, discovered the infection and has treated me ever since. I am bummed that the skin sparring reconstruction is now on hold for 6 months and that now I may need skin expanders before implants. I spent another 5 days in hospital with major IV meds. My incisions now look deformed and side boobs and infection seams are just horrid. I do have faith that my PS will be able to make me whole again and perfect the look and feel of them. 28 days post op and I am feeling better each day although I am still winded and have little energy.",

She cannot drive so after dr. appt we went food shopping for herself and a few items for me. I was out about 4 hours and when I came home, I hit the couch and fell asleep within minutes. My underarm side boob is filled with fluid and very hard to get comfortable with clothes or moving around much. I started my hormone Therapy pill yesterday also. Hoping my energy level improves over the next few weeks to begin thinking about going back to work. Anyone else having major fatigue? Anyone have infection with open wound on breast?  ",
