The nurse at my biopsy asked if I had been waiting long; apparently they have been working overtime trying to get rid of a backlog.  I am in Canada, by the way, where surgery wait lists are not unusual, at least for non-emergency conditions.  The Bi-rads score on my mammo was a 4.",

Experience was very much like Blessings and Sandi, except for my breast being squished between the plates. But there didn't seem to be as much pressure as with a regular mammogram (luckily). The reason I had a core biopsy is that the mammogram showed a pattern of microcalcifications, rather than one specific lump or cyst. So I guess they wanted samples from different parts of the area of concern. I've also had a fine needle biopsy in the past, and that was for a distinct lump rather than the calcifications. It wasn't painful, and the medical folks know exactly what they're doing and will put you at ease. Try not to worry :) easier said than done, I know!",

It was hard to worm information out of the doc - he just said \"good news, you don't have cancer\" and I think he was ready to leave it at that. I had to ask what it meant that they found atypical cells, and then ask again whether there was hyperplasia (he almost rolled his eyes when I used that term - I could tell he was thinking, sheesh, another one diagnosing herself on the internet). He also let slip the word \"ductal\" so I put the three together for a do-it-yourself diagnosis of Atypical Ductal Hyperplasia. He did say I had a slightly higher risk of bc because of my family history (father's mom & sister having bc and father prostate cancer increased odds from the usual 1 in 9 to 1 in 7). I asked what the chances are that the core biopsy might have missed an area of concern, and he said 1 in 18,000 (good odds if you're buying a lottery ticket but not too alarming in this sense). Then he did a physical exam and found a thickening in the other breast, sent me right away for an ultrasound and based on that decided it's just a simple cyst. Glad I was at the Clinic so they could get it done immediately, what a relief. I am so, so, grateful for the support and info on these boards, which made it easier for me to get through the last few months. Thanks so much to my new \"breast friends\" :) No doubt I'll be back in a few months, in the meantime I wish good outcomes and good health to all. Dale",

Have a small pillow to put under seat belt for the ride home - I had very little pain post op, was on Tylenol 3 for only a day or two after op - At home I had a wedge pillow to prop up myself in bed (and an extra pillow for under my knees). It was very hard to sit up from a horizontal position at first. Start on a stool softener right away as General anaesthetic can cause constipation. If you have to cook for yourself have some easy food ready to heat up for a few days. Make sure items you will need are in easy reach (counter height). Also I couldn't open meds with child proof caps so plan ahead - ask pharmacy to use easy open lids for any prescriptions you will need. Although you may be okay having one \u201cgood\u201d arm - special items: I had to buy pyjamas with front opening (couldn't lift arms to get tops over my head). One of those \u201cgrabber\u201d things would have been helpful for reaching things down from shelves etc. Small pillow to tuck under your armpit for comfort. - my drains came out on day 6 post MX; you will need to be draining below a certain level for two consecutive days and this can be different for everyone. The drains aren't that big but there is all the tubing as well. I just wore my regular size (but was mostly in pyjamas!) with maybe a loose sweater over top From what I have read, it seems like reconstruction causes a lot of the complications- I had none and hope you will be the same! I did have quite a lot of swelling around the incisions, and under my arms especially, but it is finally starting to subside after six weeks. I am in Canada, not sure where you would buy mastectomy items in your area. There are some specialty retail outlets here that carry mastectomy items but so far I haven't bought anything. I wanted to get a camisole with pockets to hold the drains but couldn\u2019t find anything (except online) and I didn't really need it after all. Used big safety pins to attach them to the garment that the hospital provided (like a stretchy \u201cboob tube\u201d with Velcro opening down the front). Ask your doc or call the hospital to find out if they provide something similar, maybe? Hope this helps, let me know if you have more questions. You will find lots of great info on this site and good support. There is almost always somebody who has \u201cbeen there, done that\u201d and can give you some insight. Good luck!
