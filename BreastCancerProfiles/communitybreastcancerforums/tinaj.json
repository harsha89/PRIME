Today the doc removed the steri-strips at my follow up and she pronounced all healing well so no critical problems looming.  But I'm finding that I'm darned uncomfy! The breast is actually more tender these last few days and the SNB site still feels...sandpaperish (only word I can think of to describe). My question for the lumpectomy sisterhood is...how long did it take you to get over this? How soon will I stop fearing anyone touching my chest or feeling like I can walk with a normal cadence (which will make my D's do some level of jiggle no matter how good a bra I wear lol)?  Sex scares me! When do I get the mojo back? \"Architectural distortion\" mammo at 49; non-palpable mass. Lumpectomy/SNB 2-25-11, 1.4cm IDC with some surprise DCIS! Rads and tamoxifin.

I have been doing the arm exercises since the day after surgery. I can raise the SNB arm almost vertical.  Doc just released me to start gradually adding general exercise yesterday. Glad to hear neither of you lost your mojo!  I can't imagine anyone jostling me around that much at the moment; it just seems to me like it would be wayyyy uncomfortable if not actually painful!  I hope that feeling passes very soon!  I am finding that I'm more sensitive and uncomfortable at night than I am in the morning. My nipple was bothering me most of the day yesterday for unknown reasons...my mass was back near the wall and they went in through the side so they weren't really working near it! I also now note that when I raise that arm...my nipple retracts which is just uber weird! Doc didn't seem to think that was a problem although she didn't say anything specifically about the why or how common that was when I asked her about it (forgot to ask about it while I had my shirt off so it was a hallway question instead). Thanks so much for the information! If anyone else has guidance, love to hear it! Thanks much!",

I had a core needle biopsy in late January but just had them hold the results until I finished a trip abroad...I knew that was a bell I couldn't unring and the Dr. said no issue with waiting. The bell was rung on 2-11-2010 and it's been my all consuming thing ever since as I knew it would be! Feeling positive and grateful that it's not in my nodes, that I don't have to go through more surgery and that chemo isn't likely in the cards for me.

It's been stressful for everyone the last couple of months so I can understand that even they want to get back to \"normal\" life...but so sorry team - there is no \"normal\" to go back to! I seem to be the only one that's breathing a sigh of relief and then taking a deep breath to do the research and face the challenges that come next! Rads and hormone therapy are no walk in the park! I am grateful for the positives...truly I am.  But this is still war, people!  I'm still fighting to win against a scary ass foe.  We've taken the hill for this week but next week is a whole new battle! Unfortunately, I don't get to rest on this week's results...so they're going to have to understand that I still am in a focused fight mode and there is no real rest in my near future.  My entire 2011 became toast on February 11th with the words \"you have breast cancer\"...",

I look forward to learning from you both! As a lurker, I was surprised to see what looked like my potential diagnosis (pre-pathology on the full tumor and lymph node) on women who were having what seemed like very extreme treatments (I'm learning the lingo, so forgive me if I use it incorrectly): BMX and chemo and such when they were 1cm masses with no node involvement and ER/PR+ and HER2-. I also noted these same variables and small tumor sizes on the signatures of Stage IV folks which was alarming to me!  I still find that somewhat confusing so hope to learn a bit more about whether that was more a personal choice to throw the book at it or what the variables are that lead to that treatment regime. I think it would really help lurkers and newbies! My lumpectomy was Friday and I just got the verbal read on the pathology yesterday (Weds). I meet with my surgeon on Monday and my Med Onc on Weds so I expect to know more by then.  I asked about the OncoType test in my multi-disciplinary meeting with them and they seemed willing to do it; I plan to discuss when we next meet. Oh...as a side note: I'm on Kaiser (Northern CA); my experience with them has been good overall...highly organized and they seem to communicate well between the various doctors so far but I've felt a bit like one of the cattle on occasion. I liked that they put me in a room, all the docs came in for a free feel up (it's NON-PALPABLE people!) and then they met with me all together after they agreed on a treatment recommendation, after which they gave me written notes (which weren't perfectly accurate unfortunately...the \"cattle\" effect I think) and a cassette recording of the meeting (of course...how the hell am I gonna play a *cassette*? LOL). They also gave me an RN and a PA who are more available for calls and questions as they come up. Man...I'm long winded! Sorry...will work on brevity moving foward! =)",

Additionally, the cancer was not specifically visible on the mammo last Dec despite that size; it read as an \"architectural distortion\" when comparing to my prior mammo (as I understand it)... There's DCIS as well as the IDC in the pathology. I'm actually quite scared that I have more non-palpable, non-visible cancer lurking around in one or both of my girls.",

They use a different ray for boosts than they do for whole breast. The whole breast ray (don't know what else to call it lol) goes right through you (hence the back getting some level of burn, too) as well as the floor from what they told me.  The boost ray is a different type that penetrates the skin and then dissipates as it hits the tumor site so it doesn't hit your internal organs (at least not in a way that would cause the damage the whole breast one can).  So...based on that information that I separately got from two RO's at my center, the metal probably would not have protected your thyroid during the whole breast sessions.

I actually found an inner peace (once they assured me the 11 day delay was not a medical risk) with telling them to just call me with the results the day after I got back. Then I went into a denial zone about the whole thing using the \"80% of biopsies are benign\" theory (which is an amazing feat for an analytical soul like me) and just enjoyed the hell out of my trip to the UK since I knew traveling with a gray cloud over me would be far superior to traveling with a black cloud!  Just my opinion. Wishing you the majority result of B9 results but here to support you in any way I can!",

I believe radiation damages the cells in the field, and healthy cells can recover while cancer cells cannot. Hence the need to eat high protein and take care of yourself as well as why the fatigue sets in...your body is constantly working to heal itself.  They do xrays weekly to confirm the radiation field is hitting where it should. When I quizzed the substitute RO this week (my guy is on vacation) on why my plan had changed after the first week xrays, he said that there's lots of reasons such as you relax more or (and this was fascinating) large breasts that tend not to always settle the same way when you're on your back (geez...I'm not THAT big and I have dense breasts so they don't slide under my arms or anything!), swelling in the breast, etc. BTW...now that I've met two ROs I have to wonder if they are all older, dry, professor-types or if that's just the two guys at my center?",

Make sure you get a copy of your pathology reports so you know you' have all the information. My understanding is that sun exposure to the radiation site is verboten for a year or two post-treatment because your skin has \"radiation memory\" or something. There is a pretty good set of rads prep information that was posted by GirlFriday on the March Rads thread on page 15.

The tattoos are like the size of a pencil tip.  I have 5 of them, one at the top line where the radiation hits (there's like a tan line from the middle of my chest straight across to my underarm), one at the bottom under my breast, one between my breasts, one at the side of my breast and one beside my areola (although that one didn't seem to take). They seem to make them right where your breast ends and bone begins...at least on me. They use laser light guides to line up with these tattoo dots each time you go in (and they tug a sheet that's under you to move you up, down or to roll you in order to get you in the same position every day).  Not all ROs do them; if they don't then you'll spend weeks trying to protect the sharpie marks they will put on you.  The tats are nothing; they just put a drop of ink on you and then use a kindof hollow needle to press the ink into your skin; over in a second each and no big deal. ",

He said for what I'm being given, I should start to feel better two weeks after it's over with the red turning to tan over 3 weeks and the tan lasting 3 months or so. I asked why some get worse afterwards and he said that can happen but it's usually an issue with people receiving higher doses. I can't wait for this to be over!

I tried to make 2 cakes: one for work and one for the rad center.

My tumor bed is near the chest wall, so I assume that's why it feels bruised deep. I've been released to use deoterant, regular soap, perfume, et al and can start shaving when my armpit looks ready to deal with it...my only instruction was to keep moisturizing until the dryness goes away and the red turns to tan. I forgot to ask about sun exposure, but the sun hit me in the car the other day and that was definitely not fun so I'll continue to stay out of it!

That said...once I swore it started microwaving me before the air shut off so I held my breath! Dumb ass me...if I held too soon that would put my lung higher, not lower! Duh! There are just such seemingly thin margins for error and they're tugging me around on a sheet, for God's sake. Of course, half the time I lift my ass without thinking since it seems like they're trying to tug the sheet out from under me. LOL",

TonLee: I've not counted the seconds per se, but I have to hold my breath for treatment since it's my left side so my heart stays out of the field. They shoot me from two positions...and we break each into two breath hold sessions each. First is over my right shoulder at about 1:30 or 2:00 position shooting through the inner part of my left breast. I think the total time on that based on the breath hold countdown is like 20 seconds. Second is behind my field of vision on my left but seems to be at about 8:00 position coming up through the left breast side. That would seem to be about 15 seconds. All the sessions click on and off while the machine changes the shape of the beam and I'm busy focusing on the countdown to when I get to breath again, so I'm not sure of the time! I'm holding up well. I do have the fatigue...but my skin is doing pretty decent. Pink and swollen after the session but it recovers overnight. I can see the tan line although it's not sharply drawn as yet. Congrats to slg2130! ",

Even took today's scratcher to the session with me (and it ended up in the room with me since both dressing rooms were already taken and they had me change in the rads room)...still a loser! Ah well...still only $7 from break even on them. I'm tuckered! Today after the session I did the same thing I did yesterday afternoon...grabbed a blanket and a pillow and laid on the back lawn in the shade for a 1.5 hour nap with my dog until I got a little chilled at around 6:15. We're FINALLY having good weather in the SF Bay Area! achpurple: CONRATULATIONS on finishing!!",

I had to work from home and once I finished a 7a conference call and sent and email to the team to let 'em know what was up....I went to bed and slept another 3 hours. It was all I could do to drag myself to rads and then meet some work friends at a restaurant a mile from my house for a dinner that was planned 60 days in advance because of everyone's schedule issues. That 1.5 hours of socializing kicked my ass again. Ugh.  Not sure I'm going to make it thorugh without taking some time off, dangit.",

I have not had a bra touch my skin during this whole process.  Earlier when it wasn't hot, I was using non-pilling fleece under it and these days I'm wearing a lightweight kinda silky tank and then my no-underwire bra on it's loosest setting. I sleep in a soft t-shirt-type pajama with a sports bra over it until my armpit stopped liking that then with the same bra over my t-shirt. I've look HOT this last few months; too bad there wasn't a man around to check it out!",
