I'm in the waiting stage of this unforeseen journey!  I'm 33 and received a Birads 4 MRI result a few weeks ago. Key notes in the report are: \"large area of nonmasslike enhancement involving the lateral aspect of the right breast.  Demonstrates regional clumped enhancement characteristics, with foci measuring up to 0.6cm.  Region of enhancement spanning greater than 8 cm extending into the axillary tail.  Both breasts demonstrate plateau washout kinetics.\" I did have an MRI 6 months ago - and it stated to have a follow-up, which the results above are from. I do have a lump under my right armpit (that's how this entire adventure started) and the last four weeks I've had consistent throbbing/heaviness/pain in my right breast. I'm waiting now for an MRI guided biopsy to be scheduled. I wanted to reach out for any woman with similar experiences or MRI report findings. Thanks so much for reading this...
