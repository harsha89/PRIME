I went to the mirror to see if I could see anything and noticed my left breast was pink, like a sunburn or a hicky. There was a lump in my armpit at the spot where it hurt. Also to go along with the pink breast, the blood vessels in my boob were very noticeable. After a couple days the pinkness and vessels dissapeared, all but one patch the size of a quarter. I went to the doctor, who said my lymph node was swollen 1 cm and she felt a lump in my breast and noticed the discoloration. She gave me an antibiotic and treated it is mastitis, but also ordered a blood panel, mammogram, and an ultrasound. My mamo and ultrasound with the breast specialist are scheduled next week. I got my blood results today and she said my lymphocytes/white count was high, which it would be if I had an infection that I was being treated for. She did say the lymph node swelling was down to .5 centimeter and the pink looked a little better. The pink started fading even before I was on antibiotics. She recommended that I not get the tests next week since my breast is looking better. She said if it wa cancer, it would look worse. I read online that IBC symptoms can come and go. Should I still go forward with the tests? If it was IBS, wouldn't my symptoms be getting worse?? It has been two weeks total. Thank you in dvance for any input. Log in to post a reply",
