      "Content": "WorriedWife wrote: His results came back benign, just unilateral gynecomastia. The surgeon didn't seem very concerned about the gynecomastia, just wanted to see him again if he got it on the other side. But we're thinking he should be more proactive then that, so after the holidays we're going back to our PCP to have him referred to another specialist, maybe an internal medicine specialist. Seems like he has a long road of tests ahead of him, but I think the worst is over. The surgeon said in his 18 years he's only seen 3 cases of male bc, which I guess fits into the 1% category. The surprising thing was 2 of them were in younger males, about 30 years old, like my husband. I thought the cases were overwhelming with older men, but I guess this isn't the case. Thank you for all the support.  It helped us more than I can express. My thoughts and prayers continue with you all, finding this site has opened up my eyes to breast cancer, I knew almost nothing about it previously. Log in to post a reply",

We're trying to cut processed foods out of our diet, and go organic with meats and dairy at the least, but as far as holistic wellness, I've been having trouble finding a starting point. I got a book, is his name Dr. Weir? but it's overwhelming when you start out. We're going to the Amp Winter Classic hockey game in Buffalo tomorrow to celebrate. We figured no matter what the diagnosis it'd be a happy distraction. Hope everyone has a great New Year's holiday.",

I hope you're feeling a little more at ease soon! ",

      "Content": "WorriedWife wrote: When he came in after viewing the films and xrays he did NOT look optomistic. (He even told us before we left that he felt worried after seeing the mammogram.) Then he felt the lump for a good long while (much to DH's chagrin, it hurts pretty bad) and said he felt quite certain that it's nothing to worry about. He didn't want to aspirate, because he was concerned that one area might be fine but another area that they may miss may be problematic. So he's gonna have an excisional biopsy on December 14 (the whole lump and surrounding area will be removed), and we'll get the results at his follow-up appointment a week after that. So, we'll know for sure what this thing is in 3 weeks. That's not too bad at all. I'm feeling pretty good about it. The surgeon was really nice, we both liked him. The gynecomastia, the surgeon said lots of men get it and it fluctates back and forth. It can be caused by something as simple as caffeine. I still would like him to get a few more tests to rule out anything more serious, but we'll probably wait until after the surgery to think about that. Thanks again everyone for all your help and support! I'll let you know the outcome of the biopsy. Log in to post a reply",

I'm also so glad we're getting the lump removed.  So is my husband!  When the surgeon suggested it, I said to myself \"The only good lump is a lump in a jar\".    Thanks again, Kelly ",
