I had my expanders removed 3 weeks ago because my wounds would not heal due to necrosis and seroma in both sides. Next op is for implants and breast lift my p.s said this will take 3-4 hours because of pocket work needed and lift. I expect to feel o.k afterwards as this is not a big surgery just a lengthly one so maybe will escape catheter, here's hoping!!",

My p.s said my next surgery will be approx 3-4 hours long, will I need to have this again, this is something I found very uncomfortable. Sorry if this sounds silly!!! Log in to post a reply",
