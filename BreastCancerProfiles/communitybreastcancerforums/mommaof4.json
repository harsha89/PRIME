Thank you- all of you women I read about on here are absolutely amazing!",

I wish I could have made my pic larger...  I would definitely recommend Latisse as it made this whole horrible process much easier for me to handle :)",

Is anyone else using Latisse? I started it a few weeks ago and am hopeful :)",

Long story short... my plastic surgeons office has been conducting an internal study on the effects of Latisse during chemo and so far has had a 100% sucess rate of pts keeping lashes and brows (we put it on our brows too) all through chemo and after. Latisse was even giving out free boxes to any chemo patients in the office, not sure if they still are? My ps is Dr John Kim, Northwestern. I personally just started chemo on Monday sooo... TCH every 21 days X 6 but I have high hopes about keeping my brows and lashes :)",
