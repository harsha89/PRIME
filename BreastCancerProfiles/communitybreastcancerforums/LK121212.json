It is hard to feel like I have any control at all. I will be honest the Chemo has been hard on me because I have never taken any meds. I ate healthy mostly vegetarian and fish, and I exercised 3 x week for the past year. So the Chemo is hitting me and I just haven't been able to get back up long enough to do exercise or Yoga. I have not attended any support groups because I am the type that does not show my emotions publicly. I feel like I need to be strong and just cry out when I am alone and not affect my children. My husband sees that I am strong on the outside, and when he ask, Are you O.K? I just cry and walk away. I was dx. IDC on 10/29, Double Mastectomy surgery 12/12 and Chemo started Feb, Have you started Chemo yet? ",

I am on my 3rd dose out of 6 and still anxious everytime I know the next one is coming. I don't think this is something that you can just approach knowing that it will be the same. Each of my Chemo's have been different and I am always thinking that I can be prepared by staying ahead of the game. But for some reason mine has had a different outcome each time. It could be because like I posted earlier the Doctors automatically treat what they know will be happening, but what you need to know is that you are your own protector and you need to be an active part in this treatment. You need to speak out when things are not going smooth. I hope that all goes well for you and I hope you don't take anyones experience as your guide because we are all different in the way that this Chemo affects us. You sound very positive so I would believe that you have the greatest power to your advantage. Mind over matter and for me it is Faith. Stay positive your storm will be over soon. I wish you well.

The more you move the quicker it heals. I know it is normal to want to protect it and not move it but I healed in 3 days and you are on your way to recovery soon. Hang in there,",

Be Strong, and take time for yourself is my only Advise, I promise you will get through this. ",

Maybe it is because I told my kids it is all going to be O.K and put on a strong attitude most of the times. But in reality inside I am really scared and I will be honest I hate Chemo and everything about this Cancer. I want to have a positive mind set about all of this but working at Moffitt Cancer Cnt for 5 years I think does not help. I guess it is not good to know so much. I know there are people that can beat this and I am determined to be one, I just get kicked pretty hard with the Chemo and feel like it takes 2 weeks to get back up and then I get kicked hard again with Chemo every 3 weeks Taxol/Cyto. This Tuesday will be my 3rd and not looking forward to it at all. Maybe it is just me? I think I am going in with such anxiety that it affects me terribly. I hope I could change this mind controlling illness. How do you do it?? ",

He said something that he just can't give an answer to, Environmental, chemicals in food ??? no one knows. Did you see my post on Chemo above?? And yes it is important that you start Chemo shortly after surgery when the best chance to get a cancer left behind.",

I just had Inv, ductal cell and completed my Chemo this past week. I won't say it is easy but they sure try to make it as easy as possible. Good Luck choosing.. God Bless",
