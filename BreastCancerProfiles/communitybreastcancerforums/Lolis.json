Only one or two showed up in the u/s, mamo and MRI and the pathology had 8 as the number of nodes involved. Second, third opinions are great and each doctor will tailor the treatment to the individual situation. Also, due to the young age the doctors want to throw the book at the cancer to ensure close to 100% total response. Follow you guts and instincts and if you have questions ask for more details.",

My FIL had colon cancer 10 years ago (he's a 10year survivor) mentioned that exercise helps with the wbc. Try to get a bit of it included in your day. Walnuts, Brazilian nuts are good to include in your diet.  There a diagnostic scan that you might want to ask for from your doctor and they can see how much the cancer is shrinking and that might put your mind at ease.

I was fine with the surgery but not too happy when I got my pathology report and saw stage 3 and was very surprised when I heard that 8 out 24 nodes were involved. Before going into surgery I knew that at the time of the surgery that at least one of them was comprised but wasn't expecting 8. So it took me a while to accept stage 3a. After surgery started fertility preservation and have 6 beautiful frozen embryos waiting. I don't think that will be able to carry my child as I am ER/PR+ very high percentage 95/85 respectively. So this is my weak point. Started chemo May 15 FEC-D treatment and going for my second session June 5. The SE weren't that bad till the neulasta shot.

However, I was a bit upset with my GP as she didn't tell me that at my March 2013 u/s there was a new lump as I would have asked for a second u/s and a biopsy of it give my history of fibroadenoma. Think that would have sort of perhaps caught this think at a lower stage but maybe not. It makes me think as I went from a normal u/s (as they said) to cancer in a matter of a year and the lumps measured a total of 5.4cm. Now I am asking my GP for a copy of the 2013 u/s to satisfy my curiosity.  It is a day at a time now and keep thinking that there is ladies out there that have been disease free for 27years which its hopeful for all of us. And all we can do is take charge of what's in our control and everything will follow as it has to too.  It is worth investigating in some type of alternative treatments after traditional chemo/rads that could help our immune system become stronger and help us from future scares!!!  Good day to everyone!!!!

I guess I am still mad that due to this dx I can't have babies and having a baby is all I want. We have 6 embryos frozen ready to be implanted and sis will be the surrogate mother but that doesn't seem to help. I have decided to wait until my recon is completed to start the process.  Hope you are having a great weekend! ",

Because I have to sisters I wanted to know also for my niece and if I ever have a daughter.  Working through chemo is doable. I did that, had chemo on Thursdays, friday, saturday and sunday was recovery time and monday back to work. I worked from home. Keep hydrated and listen to you body. If you are having chemo through the summer try not to stay too long out in the sun as you will be sensitive to the sun. ",

As JFV mentioned drinking water and being hydrated during the treatments is very important. Exercise, even if it is just walking helps. Rest when you need to.  I am finding chemo a bit harder than the surgery (I had unilateral mastectomy with axillary lymph nodes dissection) as I didn't have much pain from the incision itself. There's surgery boards for each month and you might find joining the one for September helpful.  Stay positive and strong!!! Hugs!!",

Mine surely did and I remember craving the costco french fries so badly this one time and then the next one I remember only eating plain rice. Then another time I ate pasta and cream cheese (I never eat that), I ate close to no meat as I couldn't stand the smell. Hubby would bbq chicken and I was in the end of the house. This happens mostly during the first few days after chemo. It's important to have energy for the reasons you mention that's why you should whatever tastes good. Don't forget the fiber as the meds that you might take before chemo might cause the big C. The rads were just tiring for me and I found that I needed some naps. You will see the RO on a weekly basis and if the skin is getting bad they might advise something to take care of it. When I asked my RO about juicing and cleansing after treatment she advised me to wait one month after the last rad. She said not to do any cleansing during the treatments as it is countereffective. As the other ladies said don't worry about the diet, eat what you can and see what your body accepts and be gentle to yourself. Hope your treatments are a breeze!!! Hugs!",

In my experience the first chemo wasn't bad but the second one was my worst as the nausea was bad for the 2-3 days after chemo so I was living on toast bread and rice. But everything else was a breeze. If you are going to take the Neulasta shot there might be some muscle pains associated with it. Walking everyday will help but don't go too far without a person in case you don't feel well. When you feel that the scalp is achy that's a sign that the hair will fall. I cut mine short before chemo started and then shaved it before my second chemo (I was on every 3 weeks regime). You can use a lint roll to help with the faling hair (after you have shaved it). Also, if you feel tired and need a nap, do so. It will help with the energy. Good luck!",

Re the nodes, if you are going for an axillary lymph node dissection the BS will remove all of the nodes that they will see. Usually they remove only Level I & II nodes. If they see any other enlarged nodes they might remove them. I had 23 lymph nodes removed and the BS saw an enlarged node in chest (lower part of the breast) and she removed it but it was negative. Everyone has a different number of nodes so the fact that they different doesn't mean that one had more or less nodes removed. You can confirm with your BS what they usually do. Good luck and this too shall pass :-)",

I was just told today that I have a recurrence in the chest wall, which is my understanding is a local recurrence and considered IIIC. However, the B.S. says the following: \"we repeated the MRI scan recently. Unfortunately, there is evidence of a chest wall recurrence in the sternum with pleural involvement. This has just been reported The pleural involvement may mean stage IV, but my RO said that the pleural enhancement may be due to the sensitivity of the MRI and that the CT scan will be a better way of confirming. I have booked the bone scan for next week and waiting for the CT scan. I have no symptoms other than this weird pain that comes and goes on the left side (side of the recurrence and original dx) but i am not able to locate the origin of the pain as it feel like a muscle spasm but it feels like a bone pain too. So what would be the treatment options? they mentioned surgery, chemo and rads but obviously nothing definite yet until the scans are done. I haven't read the MRI report as this was just communicated this morning and the report is not ready. if it is positive for pleural involvement what are the expected survival rates? i know the Drs will have to tell me that but this board has been so helpful when I was first dx 3 years ago so I would like to hear from your experiene. Also the other concern is bone mets and I know some of you ladies are doing well with bone meds but I am worried as I am only 36 and only 3 years out of my original dx and wondering if I can continue to work full time in the future. on top of this o have my two final exams for the MBA, wish me luck.

Bone scan was clear and so was the CT scan other than the area in the sternum. The CT scan mentioned that there is a 1.5cm x 2 cm area of soft tissue at the anterior superior mediastinum abutting the inner wall of the sternum. It also says that this area could be a lymph node. So I guess there is no clear answer on if it is just a node or a node and wall of the sternum. I haven't received confirmation of my stage from the doctors but when I asked the clinical trial nurse about it she said it is stage iv but will re-confirm again when I see the doctors which won't be until January 10. Meanwhile I will take the good news from the scans. Hugs Lola",

I had multifocal (same kind of tumor but spread in the breast). When I did the u/s the technician looked at the armpit nodes and one of them was enlarged. The same result was provided by the MRI but the number of nodes had increased to two. I had mastectomy and all the nodes removed. I think the direction is to do more sentinel node testing to identify node involvement. Ask your surgeon. Good luck with the surgery (it's not bad) and wish you a quick recovery!!",

I had radiation because of the extend of the tumor and nodes involved. Radiation was a bit tiring. My skin held okay during it, got red and it peeled after the therapy was completed. I still feel a bit fatigued and tired. ",

Peacestrength - what your estrogen dominace? I am at 95% + ER and 85% + and at one point I was thinking of taking my ovaries out but I don't know if I am ready for that, worried about the brain effects but will do a better research. I have 6 frozen embryos (I am 33) and I won't become pregnant (hubby doesn't want me to and the MO said that if I were her wife she wouldn't let me either). MaxineO - what kind of diet changes did you make? This last round of chemo has been very bad on hot flashes and night sweats for me. Hope you all have a great weekend. ",

I really understand the worries of being young and aggressiveness of this disease (I was diagnosed at 33 last March) but the best way to deal with it is one step/day at a time.  The back pain could be due so some disc issues. But it is hard not to worry once you have been diagnosed as we are more sensitive to all the other pains.  Congrats on you kids!!! Use them as your strength!!! Big hugs!!!! ",

As I was waiting for the results of my biopsy I thought of going for a BMX from the beginning but then I changed my mind. Now I am thinking to remove the other healthy dense breast as I don't know to worry every time I go for a mammo/MRI.  Surf this forum as it has a lot of info that will help you with you decision.  Good luck!!
