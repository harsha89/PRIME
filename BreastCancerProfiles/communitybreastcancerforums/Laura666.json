I am leaning towards unilateral mastectomy for two reasons: to avoid radiations and because anyway, i think given that it's genetic, i should have a prophylactic mastectomy- possibly double- eventually . Maybe even have my ovaries removed soon. I appreciate your replies and info. Very tough decisions to come",

I am waiting on the breast cancer diagnosis but it's 95% certain i have it based on mammos, US and MRI. Looks like DCIS but am waiting for the biopsy to tell me that it's not worse. I would love to keep my breasts but from everything i read, looks like mastectomy would be better for me because of the gene mutation i have which is called CHEK 2. And just fyi, i already had thyroid and colorectal cancer , all before 39! So this breast thing is another blow, so soon after the colorectal one. Thank you for any info Chek2 mutation; Dx: thyroid cancer- 2012; Dx: colorectal cancer- 2015 Dx 8/30/2016, DCIS, Right, 1cm, Stage 0, Grade 3, ER+/PR+ Log in to post a reply",
