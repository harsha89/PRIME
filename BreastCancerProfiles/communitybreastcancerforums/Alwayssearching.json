    "Content": "Alwayssearching wrote: I had a bilateral mastectomy with expanders for IDC and BRCA1+ on Oct 16 (about a week ago).  Wow - it has been painful.  I had 2 of four drains removed yesterday and it feels so much better!  I had posted earlier about path report and have since found out that I had 9 for 9 negative nodes!  Yeah - I meet with oncologist on Tuesday for next steps converstaion and more indepth look at path report. My question today is about cutting back on pain meds: Should I stop the oxycontin and still take the percocet as needed or should I stop the percocet and stay on the oxycontin?  I have been taking oxycontin 2x a day and then percocet as needed (about every 4-6 hours 1 or 2 tablets).  I still feel a lot of pain when both expire (like yesterday at 8pm I was due for oxycontin and it had been about 6 hours since last percocet - the pain was still pretty intense).  I would like to try to find a comfort level where I feel the pain so I do not over exert myself but I do not want to be doubled over either.  Thanks, Sharon  Sharon Dx 9/18/2008, IDC, 2cm, Grade 3, 0/9 nodes, ER+/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
