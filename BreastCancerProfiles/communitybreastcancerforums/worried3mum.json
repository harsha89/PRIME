Unfortunatley not long after I noticed dimple I suffered a trauma to the breast which caused bruising. this has caused a fat necrosis which led to frustration at the breast clinic as they kept attributing dimple to that. The dimple was visible BEFORE the trauma. I had an ultrasound where they said no shortening of ligamenta etc but they only focused on a tiny spot of breast,not the entire breast. The dimple is still there and last week I noticed a vertical type dimple on undersidr of same breast,again visible when arm raised. this area was not covered by the ultrasound in Aug. I am very worried and finding it difficult to manage anxiety with three children. Is there anything,othet than the worst case scenario,that could be causing the dimlling and what do you think my next step should be. I also sometimes get a heavy kind of feeling in the breast that I do not get in the other breast. Thanks for reading. sorry about the long post. Log in to post a reply",
