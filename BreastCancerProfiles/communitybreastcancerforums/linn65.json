However, everytime I go to the ONC which is after each treatment the only thing he asks me is; What am I doing for fun???? That is a loaded question....My goal this weekend is to do something FUN, so I can tell him about it Tuesday! I understand what you mean about a 2nd opinion. I was scheduled for surgery, and everyone kept telling me to get a 2nd opinion. So I did do to pressure from everyone, and I assumed he would just validate what the 1st doctor said, but he didn't. He did everything the opposite! Needless to say I had an hour and a half drive home from the 2nd opinion and cried like an insane person the whole way home. I ended up canceling the surgery and going with the 2nd opinion. Everything was moving so fast I didnt have time to think, and my 2nd opinion was on a Thursday and my 1st opinion and surgery was scheduled for the following Wednesday. I took the weekend to ponder it all over and decided I was not ready for a MAST, so I went with Chemo first. Every decision is hard and we are not doctors!!! I feel ya!",
