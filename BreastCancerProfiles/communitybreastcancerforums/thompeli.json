    "Content": "thompeli wrote: I have been diagnosed with an intraductal papilloma and have been advised to get it removed.  I'm trying to get an idea of how long and difficult the recovery process was.  How long until you were able to return to normal life & work?  I ask because I have a presentation on Feb 17th and I would love to have this out and healing by then!  I don't have a surgery date yet but have a consult with a surgeon tomorrow. I am 29 and this is the second time I've had an intraductal papilloma issue.  When I was 18 I had nipple discharge, they discovered a cluster of intraductal papillomas, and removed several.  Since this was 11 years ago and I probably wasn't as mature and on top of it as I could have been, I can't really remember the details about recovery.  I suspect that the papilloma I am dealing with now was present 11 years ago because I've had nipple discharge this entire time (less and more infrequent) and I recall the surgeon telling me that they tried to remove as few ducts as possible so as not to interfere with the possibility of breastfeeding in the future. Any personal stories of your surgery and recovery would be GREATLY appreciated! Log in to post a reply",
