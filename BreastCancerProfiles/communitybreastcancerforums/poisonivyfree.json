Long story short they did the diagnosis mammogram and then I met with the radiologist. I was found to have a cluster of pleomorphic microcalcifications. I am a cancer survivor who had non hodgkins lymphoma n stage 3, 13 years ago. I am 41 and my heart is severly damaged so I am not sure that if worse came to worse I could even tolerate any more chemo. I went for a needle biopsy last week, but because of the location of the cluster they were not able to perform the test. I will go this coming Thursday and have a consulatation with a surgeon, but all this waiting is starting to get to me. Guess I would just like any info from those who have gotten the same results.
