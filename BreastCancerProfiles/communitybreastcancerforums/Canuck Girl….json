I am going for a biopsy this Tuesday...take my advice becuase I don't use it...don't google. I have googled until I am exhausted! One thing I cannot find is information on round hypoechoic masses that do not have margin defined on ultrasoud report. My diagnostic mammo was a BIRADS 4 (no a,b or c noted-so, I assume it is a?) finding were postive for focal asymmetry and architectural distortion of 3cm-this seems to correspond to the area on ultrasound where the masses were found. Can a mass be round and have anything other than circumscribed margins? Thank you in advance for any insight you may have. Anyone else going for a biopsy on Tuesday...I will keep you in my prayers and to all who are on the journey of cancer you too are in my prayers. With Gratitude... Log in to post a reply",

She found the 2 solid leisions identified on the previous ultrasound and they turned out to be cysts! The focal asymmetry and architectual distortion remain but she said she thinks it is just how my breast is made. I go for a follow up in 6 months. I am happy that what they thought was solid (hypoechoic on the last ultrasound) turned out to be cysts! Phew! However, I am secretly worried that she didn't find the right areas? I have very cystic breasts and she warned me that ongoing I will likely always get call backs. Anyone getting breast MRI's done instead of mammo's? Thanks for all of your support and responses and for sharing your stories.",

Problem is, I am a specialized oncology nurse...in some ways I know too much and in others I don't. I worked clinical trials and bedside administering chemo/biotherapy and counselling patients. I am comfortable with the treatment part but so out of my comfort zone with all of the diagnostic jargon. It sounds like the round hypoechoic masses found on ultrasound could be the reason for the architectural distortion. Hopefully the wait for the biopsy results wont be too long however, I am certain it will fell like an enternity. I live in smaller city outside of Toronto so we don't have the rapid diagnostic departments that T.O. has. \"hurry up and wait\". I am going to stop researching. :)",
