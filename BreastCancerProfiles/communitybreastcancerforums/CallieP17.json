I knew that mammo's weren't given to younger women as well- so I don't know what to make of that either.  I'm seeing my OB-GYN next week and I'll bring this all up to her.  She's the one that sent me to the Breast Center.  I really appreciate the website links that you gave me :)  I feel better.",

      "Content": "CallieP17 wrote: Good morning ladies.  SO, here's my story in a nut shell.  I was experiencing pain on the side of my right breast & became really concerned when it wasn't going away.  It had been there for a couple months before I got into a Breast Center for Health.  I thought that I was getting an u/s but it turned out that it was just an \"office visit\"  Well, there were 2 docs that gave me a physical exam and they couldn't find any cysts or lumps, so they just sent me home.  They also didn't know what was causing the pain.  Well, the appt. wasn't sitting right with me- I needed answers.  So, I called the Breast Center a couple days later, explained my situation and they got me in to see the \"head\" of the Breast Center that day.  It wasn't a guaranteed u/s, but I was just happy that they got me in so soon.  She too felt my right and left breast and also didn't find any cysts or lumps.  This appt. I asked a whole stream of questions and she anwered them all and I do feel better.  She didn't think that an u/s was necessary because they're usually not given unless something's detected on a mammogram- which I can't get because I'm pregnant- OR if something is found in the physical exam.  She said that the door is always open if I wanted a biopsy of the area that's causing me pain.  The doc did give me a diagnosis of fibrocystic change.  Unlike the other 2 docs that examined me, she also pin pointed where the pain was coming from w/o me telling her.  She just didn't seem concerned at all.  From what I understand now, fibrocystic change does cause pain or tenderness... it just really bothers me that it's been lingering for almost 3 months now and it's only in one breast... and is localized.  Does anyone know more about fibrocystic change???   I tend to be a huge worrier.  When the appt. was over, I wrote a list of what was said by the doc at the appt., just so I could be reassured if I started thinking about it too much.  It helps a little.  I'm just surprised that she wasn't concerned that it was only in one breast and local.   I've read over and over again that it's not good to have only one affected breast and to have it local.  I'm starting to get confused and worried again.  Any words of comfort would be greatly appreciated.   Thanks again ladies.  Log in to post a reply",

I'm more at ease knowing that fibrocystic condition and mastitis can effect only one breast... and that you didn't have the fever, nausea or vomiting.  What is done for mastitis?  Antibiotics?  What sort of pain did you experience when you had mastitis?  Thank you for your prayers.  Callie",
