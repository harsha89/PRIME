I was diagnosed with ER positive invasive ductal carcinoma at age 42. I'm now 44 and hoping to try progesterone cream. I had never worried or thought about getting breast cancer until I was diagnosed, but I had noticed serious problems with migraines that would last a whole week before my period. I had read up and realized that I must be estrogen dominant. Now, since I'm still ovulating regularly and believe I'm estrogen dominant, I want the progesterone cream. I eat as much kale as possible because that helps break down the stronger forms of estrogen and I take lignans as well. Look up kale and lignans. I think exercise helps diminish high levels of estrogen as well.",
