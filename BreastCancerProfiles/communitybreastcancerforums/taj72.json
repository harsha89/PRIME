My mom has been experiencing some dizziness at odd times, so the oncologist is concerned that it may have spread to the brain.  We're getting a brain MRI to check.  Also for the past month my mom has been experiencing pain when she breathes and has difficulty catching her breath.  Today she started spitting up some clear phlegm when she coughs. The doctor sent her to the ER tonight to check if there's a blood clot in her lung?  That is where she's at now with my dad and I am waiting to hear what's happening.  I am very worried.  Does any of this sound familiar?  Has anyone experienced this?  Please let me know what you think.  Thank you.

She did not have a blood clot, thank goodness.  Inhalation treatments were helpful and she was given an inhaler.  She has been getting a battery of tests today and tomorrow and then we just have to wait on the results.  We are praying that it hasn't metstastasized.  I appreciate your response and I pray for your full recovery as well!",
