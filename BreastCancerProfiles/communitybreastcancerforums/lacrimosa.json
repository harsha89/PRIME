I am from Turkey. The doctor is a friend of us. I am praying they wont find any spreading. Hoping for the best. We dont care about her breasts to be honest. She is hell of a woman and feels ok with removing her breast. Is it possible to have 2 cm tumor in a late stage? Is having a tumor around this size means its early",

Yesterday we went to a GP, mammo + ultrasound they found a 2cm tumor on her breast. The doctor said it is most probably cancer. Also took biopsy from it. We will have the exact results in 7-10 days. They could see some micro things on 2 lymph nodes as well but they say it is not a big deal. She is 61 yo, in menopause and she is all I have. (My father died long time ago, no siblings etc.) I am beyond shocked. The fear is taking over my body. I feel like I can't breathe. I keep thinking what if it's spread to her bones, lungs, chest, anywhere. She seems incredibly healthy but I can't stop thinking about it. I am so scared for her. I am so scared about the days we will have to face. Chemo, surgery and all the other things. I am so scared that I will lose her. I really really need some comfort and need to know that I am not alone. I am freaking out but I don't want her to see me like this. Log in to post a reply",
