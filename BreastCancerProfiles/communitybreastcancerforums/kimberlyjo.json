It is really hard to be 35, and going through this alone. BC does not run in my family. Out of four girls, I am the first to get it. My sisters now know they have a 50/50 chance of getting BC before the age of 50. I will be starting Chemo on Tues. I've already looked for wigs. I even called the Pastor of my church to ask permission to wear a hat inside church if the wig does not arrive on time.  I hope all my sisters are doing well with their treatment.",
