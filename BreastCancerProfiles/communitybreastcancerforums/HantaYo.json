I was prescribed Hydrocodone 5mg/acetaminophen 325.  I went home 4/30 the day after my BMX with a script for 30.  I still have 18 left.  I think I took 2 on that day, then after that only took 1 at night for the first week.  Since then I have just taken an occassional one at night.  I never had severe pain, not even right after surgery.  I only took Morphine once because I thought it would help me sleep (wrong).  My PCP will not allow any sleeping pills. On a scale of 0-10 my pain was mostly a 3, max of 4 and while the pain pills would make it less, I really could have done without them without thinking I was suffering, even right after surgery. I am an RN and I know everyone is different. Peoples bodies with nerves and muscles and such are each put together in unique ways.  Also, habits of posture, pattern of movement and body size and different speeds of healing can come into play. One person's experience with pain is difficult to compare to another one's (although it is nice to know what the range of different experiences are so if you know you are in the ballpark or way out of it). I also think some surgeon's technique just ends up causing less pain.  I was shocked that I didn't want or need more because I am usually a real wimp, but to be honest, I have hurt worse after shoveling snow out of my driveway than I ever did after BMX surgery. After the above, I can still say I have discomfort.  Mostly soreness, not real pain.  I do feel the very tight band accross my chest, but although it feels extremely tight it is not pain. The underpart of my arms and the sides of my chest do feel like I am wrapped in chicken wire or sandpaper or something that is hard to explain. It is mostly when the areas are touched by clothing or skin against skin.  The hydrocodone does NOT make a difference in this for me.  However, when my husband rubs, scratches or massages my back it goes away during the time he is doing it.  Also, sometimes when I am very still I do not feel it. Hope this helps and that others tell about their range of pain.  Good luck with going back to work.  It does help drag the mind away from thinking about cancer for a while. Karla",

NativeMainer, thanks for suggestion about asking if my cancer diagnosis/treatment/complication is a barrier.  I think I also need to see if my \"age\" is a barrier since I am 63.  I am certainly more conditioned than many of my collegues who are 2 decades younger so physical ability is not an issue (unless the compression sleeve for LE becomes an issue).  I have had perfect work attendance for about 10 years too (if I was sick I always found my own replacement with a last minute trade instead of calling in ill). However, as an older employee with multiple decades of nursing experience, my salary level is double that of a less experienced RN.  I think this is what they might be thinking about.   My health system allows a max of 12 weeks of sick leave a year (this is unpaid time of course unless one uses their Paid time Off hours).  Before surgery I didn't know how extensive my treatment would be because of the unclear part about invasion so I requested 3 weeks of vacation (max we can take at one time) starting on my day of surgery because I didn't want to start using my allowed sick time.  Well, I came back to work after my 3 week \"vacation\" but my surgeon had me on light duty for 2 weeks.  I was surprised and angry when I was told this 2 weeks of light duty count against my allowed sick time and that they might be making it retroactive 3 weeks since I was on vacation for medical reasons.  So, even though I never invoked sick leave, I only have 8 more weeks of any sick leave or light duty left between now and 4/28/2011.  This will most certainly affect my decision about reconstruction.  During surgery the plastic surgon decided not to begin first stage because the blood supply was dimminished to my \"skin sparing mastectomy\" and they had to debride all that spared skin and felt it would compromise my results.  So I have to wait 6 months from date of surgery to see if I can still go with implants or need to go with a flap.  A flap might take up too much time off so I hope for TEs and implants.  Sorry I am rambling on so much.  If I would exceed my 8 weeks left between now and April 28 then I would be forced into a furlough and any position I had at the time would be lost.  I would be able to continue my insurance (at cobra rates however which would be 20 X my current cost).  I have seen this happen to a coworker who had a complication from her pelvic sling surgery and she went over the 12 weeks, and lost her position so I know it can happen. In regards to having my Staff Development Nurse Position being eliminated, they did develop a new Clinical Nurse Educator position who is now fulfilling the duties of my SDN role.  It appears they wanted a master's prepared nurse in the position and have gotten by with it by changing the title. Squidwitch42, thanks for your support.  I am hoping to hear about the most recent interview this week.  I interviewed on 6/15 and was told I would know in 2 weeks.  Well, tomorrow is day 28.  Last week I called up HR and asked them the status and they didn't know. I interpret this as a no because they always call and offer the postions to those they want to hire and only let those who get a \"no hire\" know after the one whom they have offered it to has confirmed acceptance. I have got to quit this whine whine whine.  I am driving myself a bit crazy with it. ",

This surgeon is not one of the overly aggressive ones to my knowledge.  She said my spine is really unstable at this point and I could be looking at permanent damage (difficulty walking and loss of bladder and bowel control)  with a small degree of trauma such as a fall or a fender bender.  I saw my primary MD for pre op H & P yesterday and he read the MRI report and feels like I really should go along with the surgery and feels like this surgeon is quite conservative. The surgeon didn't promise me relief of my symptoms but she said there would be a good chance of decreased symptoms.  It all depends on how much damage has already occurred from the compression.   She said her main goal is to provide my spine with stability so that I don't worsen and that her success rate for this was 95%. I will have to wait till Monday to see her availability in the immediate weeks following. Karla ",

They ended up not being able to put in TE immediately.  Because I had enough time ahead I requested and received 3 weeks of vacation for the surgery before I told my employer about the surgery,  It is kind of hard keeping your employer out of your surgery information when you work in PACU/POH.  When I returned the MD wrote for light duty for 2 weeks (I was currently still in a desk duty situation as SDN but had been notified my position was being eliminated) Buuuuuuuut since my hospital does not recognize light duty, even though I returned to work those two weeks counted against my allowed FML time. I think 6 weeks is a very reasonable time as long as you are complication free and have understanding co-workers (forget trying to get management to understand)",

I had my surgery mid day and was dismissed the next morning.  The surgeons at our facility do not order PCAs for mastectomies or implant reconstruction unless a flap has been done.  You get some doses of fentanyl in PACU.  Once on the floor they start you on Oral pain meds immediately if you tolerate oral fluids.  For breakthrough pain you can have up to two doses of Morphine 1-2mg but most patient's with BMX or BMX first stage implant reconstruction don't need it.  Next morning you go home.  If some one comes in for first stage implant reconstruction or for exchange surgery it is outpatient and you go home about 1-2 hours after you roll out of surgery. Flap surgery is a whole different matter with PCAs and usually 2 -3 overnights depending on which flap procedure is done.  Our PSs prefer to manage their pts out of the hospital and in their own homes ASAP.  They strongly feel that the incidence of infection will remain lower if they are in their own germ envirnonment.  They would rather see them every day in the office rather than have them stay in the hospital.  Patient's seem to do well on oral pain meds.  Please know our hospital does not do the 12 hour extensive procedures done in some places.  Flaps are mostly laps and trams.

I even have day packs with hip belts.  After we recoup from medical expenses I am hoping to invest in some lighter weight gear (but I also hate to give up what has worked so well thru thick and thin).

I was the individual who asked about the risk of lymphedema with backpacking, solo canoeing, and international air flights and blood draws etc.  I am only 63 and it is way to soon to slow down my activities in the outdoors. I first went to the LE segment because I wanted to ascertain my risks.  This was after I visited with my BS, PS, med oncologist and the local ACS about my risks for developing lymphedema if I continue these activities and the response from all was--\"aah, I've never been asked that before\".  It was suggested that I just observe what happens and to stop the activity if I develop any problems and see a DR.  OK, if I am 30 miles and 3 days from the closest trailhead or 60 miles from a river access do you think I can just stop? Would my DH like to carry an additional 40# or paddle both of our canoes? Do you think the DR. would make a trail call?  So, I was on my way to discovering that the docs do not have a great deal of concern about LE.  From reading your posts it appears that I will have to \"adapt\" my activities in some way to reduce my risks. I don't think I could find a Sherpa around these parts.  But maybe I could find trails that allow goats or some other animal that might be willing to carry the bulk of my supplies.  I know most dogs usually can't carry more than their own needs.  For canoeing, I guess I might have to give up the challenges and go for the \"floats\" or god forbid get in a tandem and eat grapes while my DH does all the work.  Maybe I will see who else out there has had SNB and is still backpacking/canoeing, etc.  I really would rather find some other ways without goats or tandems.

Preop nurses (I am an RN in preop and recovery) in a busy unit are usually more experienced and skilled in peripheral IV starts on upper extremities than anesthesiologists. Anesthesiologists in most places don't start IVs on a regular basis and thus may not be as skilled as the RNs.  I would recommend asking for the most experienced IV starter and not for the anesthesiologist.  In regards to the foot IV, it can be done of course but it is not without increased risk of developing blood clots and infection and would be contraindicated if an individual has peripheral vascular disease.  Some places have policies that do not allow RNs to start a lower extremity IV in an adult because of the increased risks.  In this case the anesthesiologists are the only ones who can do it. One peripheral IV site that can be used is an external jugular vein in the neck.  Looks horrible, is an awkward place to have it, but when arms and legs are not good choices it could be used.  The anesthesiologist would be the one to start this IV. Some of my patient's like to have numbing of the site first and some dislike the second stick involved.  For me, it distorts the approach to the vein and makes it more difficult to enter the vein. But no one should have to wait for lidocaine in order to numb the puncture site.  The RN can use just plain sterile saline for injection for the numbing.  Studies have shown it is just as effective in numbing as lidocaine.

Unfortuanately the one shoulder sling bag will not carry enough for me.  I need a full size back pack that can carry 40# and thus I need the bag frame to distribute the majority of weight to my hips.  I have never liked having any weight on my shoulders and have developed a habit of only using the shoulder straps to keep the bag from swinging so there is no actual weight distributed on my shoulders.  However, the staps do fit firmly (compress) against my clavicles so I will have to make sure it doesn't affect things.  At age 64 I am not ready to stop backpacking so I am hoping I have \"conditioned\" my Lymph drainage as well as me feet for this trek.  Just like I have to pay special attention to keep my feet in good shape on a trip I will be paying special attention keep my LE in control.  We will only be backpacking for 5 days 4 nights so I actually might be able to stay under 40#.  And spring time the water is plentiful so won't have to haul too much of that at a time.

What pleasure! In regards to drainage, I believe the important part is that what ever the amount, small or large, is that any fluids in the surgery area are drained by the drains and do not remain in the tissues.  Fluids that remain in the tissues can increase discomfort and risk for infection or delayed healing. Beyond that, I think the amounts are very individual for each of us and not a matter of great concern. I had my bilateral mastectomies on 4/29 and although the first 24 hours was greater, since then I have been ranging 140 to 150 on each side.  It is still fairly dark pink and sometimes some \"ugly\" fatty looking string type stuff drains out and when it is in the measuring cup it kind of looks like little fat globules floating on top.  In regards to bruising, around each of the two drains I have about 2 inches by 5 inches of bruising. I also have a bruise where every heparin shot was given. The Lovenox does not seem to bruise as much. On the side the 3 sentinel nodes were removed I have a fair amount of bruising under my arm towards my back.  Above and below the incisions in places it looks less like bruising but is a pinkish blue color.  My DH was so brave yesterday and changed my dressings.  Things do not look pretty and I was so proud of him.  He also helped my with my bath.  The PS said no shower till drains are out.  A friend brought me some \"comfort bath\" wipes which you heat up in the microwave.  Then you use them on your body parts.  DH did my back and legs.  I really liked him doing my back.  We have been married 38 years and it has been a while since he did that.  I can't believe the difference between the calmness I feel now compared to the clenching of teeth stress before surgery.  I was so scared of having an \"anesthesia\" accident or something stupid going wrong.  The care I received exceeded my expectations and I felt very cared for.",

As to her 95% success rate, I understood it to be 95% of her surgical cases for this dx/procedure had the progression of spinal cord and nerve damage halted without further intervention.  She wouldn't state percentages of improvement in my symptoms, just said there was a good chance I will have improvement but that it all depends on how much the symptoms were due to permanent damage that has already occured and there were no promises or guarantees for symptom improvement.  However, I will be quite disappointed if I get no improvement.  I have taken care of some patients who have had significant improvement by the time they wake up in PACU but for most it is not that dramatic. I work 7:30-6 the next two days so will have my brain fairly well occupied between now and OR.  Although scarry it is not the high peak of terror that I felt before my mastectomies.  One of the BX had shown possible invasion and so it was a long 6 weeks in limbo waiting to find out.

It is a form of greeting and means \"I salute the God in you\".  It may possibly be a Buddhist term instead of a Sherpa word.  The Sherpa's primarily were quite solid in Buddhism.  It helps me to focus on the value of the other individual I am communicationg with and not taking them for granted, especially when one is not face to face.

Receptor status is pending.  The nodes were all negative including one giant size 3.5cm one.  I can't figure out how neither me nor my doctors were able to feel this giant node. My prophylactic side had a diagnosis of atypical ductal hyperplasia and they had 4 nodes from that side too that tested negative.  Do the nodes just \"accidently\" get included or is this unusual.  And the atypical ductal hyperplasia, I am not too sure what that means. In regards to the PS my drains won't come out until they are less than 25ml/24 hours.  I have a long way to go.  I am having 180 out on my CA side and 85 out on my prophylactic side.  I am to stop doing the exercises they had me start in the hospital.  There is some necorsis along my incisions which confirms that it was a good idea not to put in the TEs at this time.  It is too soon to know what choices I will have down the road for reconstruction. Pain wise, it is a bit different and perhaps more bothersome than earlier.  There is a sense of a tight band accross my chest and the skin under my arms is a very sensitive/raw feeling (but no skin breakdown)  and sometimes a brief shooting pain in my sternum area. Glad to know I am not alone with my \"surprise size belly\".  I can't believe how big my belly looks both in profile and looking down at it.  I must say it is certainly easy to give my Lovenox injections into my belly since it protrudes out there so far, but my shape is definitely an A frame model.  I look like a pyramid on stubby stilts. I see the oncologist tomorrow. ",

Saw the Oncologist this AM for my first visit.  NO TREATMENT NEEDED.  The receptor status was not in yet, but regardless of what it shows there will not be any hormone therapy since risk for reoccurrence is so low. We are going to get a second pathology review from Mayos just for confirmation purposes. I see him again in one month.  So my journey ahead is periodic follow ups (don't know how frequent or with whom yet) and the delayed reconstruction since they couldn't do immediately secondary to skin circulation issues.  I have been so lucky to come out with such good news.  I can't quite figure out why, but if I take a pain pill at night I am more comfortable all day long.  If I skip it at night, I have aching at night and tightness and burning during the day.

The only antibiotic I will get will be the one pre op.  Studies have shown much benifit to having the antibiotic in circulation at time of skin incision but no benifit to prophylactic antibiotic therapy post op.  I have to wear TEDs for one week and take Lovenox injections for one week to prevent DVT.  I hope I don't have steri strips or much dressings.  I had them at my biopsy and they totaly burned my skin off.  With my BMX I removed all tape and just kept a clean softee vest on and that seemed to work just fine.  I am hoping I can do the same.  I recently went to a seminar on Women's Cancers and their treatment and my PS was the speaker for Breast Reconstruction.  He said that with expanders he usually fills with 100-200 during placement and then fills are 50 ml per week for a couple months.  I can not perceive how my skin could hold that much to start with but since we are working on \"modest goals\" I am guessing we will start with lower amounts.  As you can see I am quite obsessing about tomorrow.  I have lymphydema in my right arm so my left is only choice for IVs and BPs.  My veins are tiny things.  I am going to super hydrate today and till 11PM tonight to see if that will help.  I have talked to my anesthesiologist about my Cspine precautions and that I must be awake when moved or repositioned and called scheduling to make a note of this on the main surgical schedule.  I have also told the pre-admission nurse who called yesterday. I have asked him not to intubate me but just to use an LMA and he has agreed to that.  I also talked to the manager of the Outpatient Surgical Suite and the Circulator of the OR room will come and talk to me before I go to the room.  I actually would like anesthesia to not put me out until I am all prepped and draped but don't know if he will agree to that.  My mind is going 100 miles an hour!  I have got to settle down.  I need to freeze some tomatoes and apples so I better take care of that today!

It has been three weeks since my BMX and I get to go back to work on Monday, although I am restricted to light duty for 2 more weeks.  After that full duty will mean back to lifting 50#. Hopefully I can \"ease\" into that level because I know I have lost strength as well as ROM.  I start PT on 6/2.

The CT scan showed no residual cord compression and enough fusion in my C-spine to get a clearance to return to work without restrictions but I have to have a nerve conduction study ?

Anyway, there is no way any type of decent universal precautions can be maintained with a gauntlet unless you would continuously wear a rubber glove over it and treat the rubber glove as your skin and then wash and apply a second glove when gloves were appropriate.  Not workable in my opinion.  Soooooooooo what I do is on the days I work, I wear the gauntlet before and after work and then at night wear a solaris glove to reduce the secondary hand swelling from going without the gauntlet.  Seems to work for me but right now my LE is in my upper arm/axilla/chest area and is very stable so someone who has LE in lower arm this might not work for them.  My hand swelling comes from the compression of the sleeve and not from LE so it reverses easily at night with the solaris glove.

I am back in circulation.  It has been a long time since I have been able to get on here and much continues to happen.  To start with, it was just too uncomfortable to be on the computer.  My trifocals combined with the 7/'28  C5-6, C6-7 decompression and fusion with plating made it just too uncomfortable to be online.  When I was ready to get back on my modem would not connect.  When I got a new modem hooked up, we left town for over a week.  Now I am back and on line. My healing from the cervical spine surgery is good.  The plates and screws remain in correct position and I have no \"surgical related\" pain.  However, the pain/numbness I sought help for is not improved (she never promised the pain would be gone but did say there was a good chance for improvement).  The surgeon put me on lyrica three weeks ago.  No improvement but it is harder to wake up in the morning and my concentration and short term memory is definitely impaired.  I am consistently walking 2.5 miles per day, rain or shine.  Sometimes if I walk in the early part of the day my pain in my left shoulder, arm, elbow starts after walking for 3 minutes and by 6 minutes gets up to 8-10.  I have to stop when it gets to a 10.  It receeds after not walking for a minute.  If I walk later in the day the pain still starts at 3 minutes but may not get worse than a 5.  This is the exact pattern of why I went for help.  The pain also happens if I sit in a certain positons or lay on my right side.  I am glad I am not going to be paralyzed from the cord compression but I am sorely disappointed about the continuing pain.  I dread walking.  On a curious note, while we were out of town I trail walked with young family members (6 and 8) for 5 miles at 7,000 elevation with NO pain, however my left arm was weak during that time.  I did fall once and felt stupid for being on a trail then, but there was no soreness in my neck afterward so I was lucky. Reconstruction:  When I had my BMX the sureon had done a skin sparing procedure.  When the PS started his work the CA side had poor skin perfusion so he trimed it up a bit and worked on the left side lifting the pectoral muscle to make the pocket for the TE.  He then noted that there was still poor skin perfusion on the Rt side so he excised more tissue and barely had enough to close the wound.  On the left side he ended up removing all the \"spared\" skin and closed that side.  When I woke up they told me I had to wait 6 months to discuss reconstruction.  Well, my 6 months is up 7 days after my Family Medical Leave runs out.  I will not get any more FML until late May.  I saw the PS on Wed and he said that my skin now was as good as it will be in May and I could have the reconstruction as soon as it could get scheduled  as long as I had 3 weeks before going back to work.  I told him I would have to be able to go back to full duty by 10/22 or lose my job so if they can't schedule me by 10/1 it will not happen till summer.  I hate the way I look.  It is such a cavern on my chest.  The scars are ugly and the right one is at a different level than the left.  When I measure my \"cavern\" it is equivalent to a minus B.  Although I couldn't see my belly over my boobs before, my belly preceeds the rest of me to a great degree.  I truly have begun to hate my appearance and am embarrassed about it. The prosthesis have not been great.  When I first dress with them I do like how I look, however they are hot, hot, hot.  Since there is the cavern the bra/prosthesis move about when I do and rub against skin and make me sore.  I want to have TE and implant.  PS wants to do a Latissimus Dorsi flap with TE.  I do not want a flap.  I want to return to my canoing and backpacking and I use those muscles for both.  My arms tire when paddling so my technique uses the strong muscles of my torso and I can go all day.  He can not assure me that I won't have weaker muscles but he feels that I won't be able to have as good as an outcome for my boobs with out the flap. He said there was a \"reasonable chance\" that just the TE -implant would work but there was also a reasonable possibility it would fail. He recommends the flap but my neurosurgeon will not permit an anesthetic unless I remain flat on my back during surgery. She will not clear me for a flap until Febuary. I would also be OK with the Brava System with micro fat transfer but he is only considering doing this in his practice and not yet ready to start.  He will see Dr. K in toronto sometime in October.  If he could say we will do that in the summer I would wait, but he is not that close to committing to it.  I want some boobs!  I am waiting for the call to see if they can get me in by 10/1. On another note, I have had my first consult for a workup for possible bladder tumor.  The urologist is absolutely wonderful to talk with.  There was a student PA with him that was obviously a very new student and it was also nice to see how he worked in instructing the PA without compromising his relating to me the patient.  I am really not too worried about this but am still anxious to get the word that I am clear.  The reason for the concern is microscopic blood in my urine.  I have had this symptom for 4 decades and have had various workups, IVP, Cysto in years past, the most recent cysto being 2002.  However, the urologist explained that this is still something that is a concern and needs to be re-evaluated every five years as long as it continues. I will be having a CT urogram and a Cystoscopy.  I am waiting for their office to call with the date. I hope they don't choose the same date as the TE because they are in different places. One more note.  Our sweet cat Mela, 9 years old,  has gotten very sick since the middle of August.  She lost over 1 pound since last year.  She has polycystic kidney disease and her Cr. is 5.74 and Bun 99.  Her K is low but she refuses all efforts at getting her to ingest the powder. When they gave her fluid therapy she got a lot better, more alert, engaging in play, jumping up to look out the window.  We are now going to start daily fluid therapy on her at home.  I will give her 100 ml of solution sub cutaneously.  At the vets she is scared and still.  At home when we have restrained her in past for pills or to get her in the carrier she has two dozen arms and legs that are everywhere, so we will see how it goes today.",

Hello everyone.  Surgery yesterday went great.  No complications.  It took about 2 hours in surgery then 1 in PACU and 1 in Phase II and then I went home.  They had given me 100 of Fentanyl in PACU and although I felt reasonable I asked for 4 of Morphine to tide me over till I ate a cracker and got the orals on board in Phase II.  It must have taken me a pint of water to get the cracker off the roof of my dry mouth. The pillows worked great on the way home I think.  I am sort of amnesic for that part. My husband made me toast slathered with marjarine and it was perfect for lunch.  I drank tremendous amounts of water yesterday and they had given me 2 liters IV and I have third spaced most of it.  I gained 8 pounds from yesterday morning till this morning.  I don't know where it is.  My LE arm and truncal E actually feel less swollen.  We all know the TEs don't weigh that much.  I got Allergan 133MX 600 cc.  They put some saline in but I don't know how much.  But I AM NO LONGER CONCAVE!  I even have a tiny bit of cleavage, like a 12-13 year old girl.  I love it.  I can't stop lifting out my softee and looking at them.  They look so good!  DH likes them too.  And the incision lines look better than before too.  OMG I can really picture myself in a swimsuit again.  Now, after all that good news I had a very uncomfortable night last night.  My pain pills are NORCO which is Hydrocodone 5 Acetaminophen 325.  I was taking 2 every 4 hours and they were not relieving it. If I had been in the hospital I would have asked for Morphine.  Finally at 4 AM I augmented one of the left over Flexerils from my C spine OR and that helped.  That kind of broke the cycle or I cleared the bad peak or something. I slept for 4 hours with crazy dreams and it hasn't been that bad today.  Only taking one at a time and my last one was 6 1/2 hours ago and I don't feel like I need one yet.  When I go to bed I will take 2 and add a flexeril as I see fit or not. As to the question of the day I believe they use selson blue for scalp psoriasis and sometimes also for really bad dandruff. Karla",

I am going down to Interventional Radiology shortly to get a pocket of fluid drained that is near the TE.  Gosh, I hope they don't poke a hole in the TE.  They will do cultures and insert a drain.  I am hoping it is just seroma and not a pocket of pus.  The PS and the ID MD were in here together and felt there is a good chance to salvage the TE if the infection is just in the skin.  I am hoping, but man, it made me so sick so fast that I worry that it is in the blood stream or in this pocket.

Hi everyone.  I haven't posted for a while.  I am just so discouraged.  I was in the hospital for 6 days in October for SIRS related to the pocket of infection lateral to my right TE.  They put in a tunneled internal jugular power port the day I was discharged -10/26.  I am on home IV antibiotics twice daily.  The drain is still in and I go for another drain check at interventional radiology on 11/17.  They have been doing weekly labs and this week my WBC was finally down to normal at 10.1.  The CRP is still elevated, sed rate went up a smidge.  My creatine went up to a high normal so I guess I need to drink more water with this Vancomycin. I will be on IV antibiotic for several days after they decide to pull the drain. As of right now the earliest I would get released to return to work would be 11/26, however I was informed today that I will be put on medical furlough as of 11/18.  It has no benifits except if I am able to be rehired within 12 months my seniority (for PTO rate accural) will be reinstated.  However, I can not bank any of my current PTOs to use when I am rehired. I will have about 200 hours unused.  I can cash them out at a 40% tax rate but if I am able to get another job there (after having 22 years with the system) I will have to work a long time to accumulate enough for any type of vacation.  Also, when I return, instead of them continuing with my current 11% employer contribution to my pension plan, it will be reduced to 2%.  The absolutely worst news though is that they are eliminating my position and will not be posting it for rehire.  I asked if I could apply for a casual/on call position when I get released and I was told they are not hiring for those at this time. The good news (sort of) is that the bladder tumor work up (CT urogram and cysto) that my primary MD has been trying to get set up since July and in which I keep having to cancel because of other issues is finally going to get done tomorrow morning.  The Infectious Disease doc wanted me to accomplish this either while I am on the IV antibiotics or wait 3-6 months and luckily the urology center had an open spot that they were happy to fill.  I will know the preliminary results by noon tomorrow.  I am not very concerned but there is always that bit of worry.  I am going by myself.  My husband has taken off way too much work this year and we can't afford for him to loose his job too. It is really hard not to lay in bed all day and feel sorry for myself.  I would like to start walking but am so afraid it will increase the drain amounts.  Except for 2 days I have had 6 countinuous weeks of drains.

Winter has arrived!.  We got about 5 inches of very wet heavy snow last night.  We have a pin oak very near our bedroom and extending over part of the house..  It does not lose it's leaves until spring so the leaves collected a lot of this stuff and bent the limbs down (to the ground for the branches that are only about 20 feet up).  Anyway, along with the wind blowing against the tree iand letting globs of snow fall on the roof it sounded like there were squirrels jumbing and rolling on our roof for hours.  Kind of wierd.  I almost felt like going into the attic and checking to see if the roof was intact. The power had gone out about 9PM.  It was on when I got up this morning so don't know how long it was out.  Snow and cold started a month earlier last year and up till yesterday we had a wonderful autumn. I had my workup yesterday and my kidneys, ureters and bladder are all perfectly normal.  No signs of any polyps or suspicious issues at all.  The urologist was very nice and gentle and explained things on the screen to me as he was doing it.  He didn't have any explanation for the chronic hematuria except perhaps if I had a habit of letting my bladder get overdistended then the vessels might stretch and leak some cells.  He didn't say this but I am guessing he was thinking \"nurses bladder\".  As nurses we do suppress those bladder urges when our patients need us (or when the work place system doesn't allow us timely breaks).  So good news. My husband was quite worried and says a big weight has been lifted off his shoulders. He is making plans for my activities once I get cleared by the docs for physical labor and while I don't have a job.  LOL.  He wants me to paint the interior of the house!  He even wants to look at colors today so \"I \" will be ready to go immediately when cleared.  I don't know if he is trying to keep me busy and less lying depressed in bed or if he is just cracking the whip with my productivity around the house.  I do know that I get a lot of points for productivity for some little unexpected effort (like this week I made date bread for him, he loves dates and I had never made date bread before, he loved it).",

I don't think it is related to the fill but it was a bit disturbing tonight to lift up my vest to look at the little girls and saw that the left incision had been draining during the day.  The drainage was mostly dry, about 10 cm in diameter on my top.  When I looked close at the incision I can see a very small area of the incision that has opened, perhaps 2mm at most.  If I gently push on the skin above or below the opening, small amounts of serosanguinous drainage comes out.  There is no tenderness (it is in the numb area of the chest actually), no reddness, increased warmth or swelling of the tissue.  No signs of pus.  I had a tentative appointment scheduled for tomorrow in hope that my drains would be ready (day 16) but they are still draining about 50/24 hours.  I am sort of torn about whether to go in or just ask to speak to someone.  The reason for that is that I have caught some kind of respiratory virus from my husband and have a really bad cough and some fever.  My husband had fever for 3 days and I am concerned we might have influenza and I do not want to carry that into the PS office.  Actually I am thinking maybe parainfluenza and not the bad kinds.  Adults don't usually get fevers of 101 with a cold but influenza usually brings a higher fever than that.  Oh, well.  I will definitly be calling them as soon as the office opens in the AM.

Did any of you have fluid retention with infections.  I will be here at least till Monday. Traci, I am in the hospital system of my employment and I can say I am mighty proud of the nursing care I have received.  The caring they show has been great.  They tell me everything they give me and show me labs when they come back, go the extra step with any request, I am just so proud.  On Monday, I will see if Human Resources and the Brass .is likewise as I try to find out what my options are.

I am still in the hospital, labs are \"normalizing\" but not there yet.  Culture from the pocket of fluid grew out Staph Aureus coagulase negative.  The MRSA screens were all negative.  That was good news.  Now we are waiting for the sensitivity report.  So we still don't know if I will be lucky and get orals or if I will have to continue IV antibiotics.  Today the ID specialist was hopeful that there was enough space between the pocket and the TE that there is a possibility there is no biofilm on it.  He says it is really tough to get the biofilm to go away if it has settled in and then the TE would have to be removed. I did not hear back from either my supervisor or HR about the FML to furlough status.  So still waiting. Karla",

So I am certain your nurses did not lie to you and your husband.  That was the most complete information that they had available to them at the time.  The final pathology report comes weeks or more than a month later because the pathology work is so extensive as they make minute slices throughout the tissue to see everything that is there. That allowed them to \"find\" the nodes embedded in the breast tissue.  I talked to a pathologist and they said the removal of the nodes could not have been avoided by any surgeon who was meticulous enough to remove as much breast tissue as possible.  Only a lumpectomy would have left some of those nodes  (I was not elegible for a lumpectomy).

Hope4future, I think everyone is a bit different.  Although I rarely took naps before my BMX I found I needed them after surgery, several a day.  After the first first week I started walking outside, just for 15-20 minutes which seemed to make me more tired to begin with but then as I increased the time of my walks I began to feel like I was less tired and had more energy during the day.  I was four weeks out yesterday.  I returned to work this past Monday.  I did fine for 10 hours at work on Monday but was almost too exhausted to eat supper when I got home so I knew I had over done it.  I fell asleep in the living room.  The rest of this week has not been quite as exhausting but I find I want to go to bed as soon as supper is cleaned up after.  Our bodies are still healing which takes more protein and more rest.  I would expect that nearly full energy should be back by about 8 weeks. There are many things that could delay this including complications, emotional work, rads, chemo and heavy family responsibilities.
