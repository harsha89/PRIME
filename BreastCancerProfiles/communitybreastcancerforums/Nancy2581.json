Not really any side effects from it other than some hot flashes. Oops I was wrong about the difference - see below lol Nancy",

Never felt nauseated and never threw up. I usually felt a little off by day 3 and 4 after chemo, but honestly that was it. I still walked my two chocolate labs twice a day. It's not fun losing your hair - I really hated that part, but it's grown back. I didn't want to do chemo, but I'm glad I did. It has given me piece of mind that I've done all I can to be rid of the nasty beast. Nancy",

I just finished chemo dec 30th and it wasn't as horrible as I thought. I start radiation tomorrow. As soon as you get all of the pieces of your diagnosis together and a treatment plan you will feel better. If you feel your anxiety is taking hold ask your doctor for Ativan. It really helped me calm downin those early months. Hang in there we are here for you. Nancy",

They say 80% of lumps are benign so hang on to that. I know you have some swollen lymph nodes too, but try not to go there until you get there. It's hard - the mind can be evil. I know mine was. Hopefully you can find something to occupy your time until Monday - like go shopping lol. Hugs Nancy",

After taxol #6 I got this pain in my right thigh that shoots down the thigh. It's been 8 weeks now and I still have it. I did mention it to my MO a while ago and I told her I thought maybe taxol was causing it. She said it sounded like the sciatica nerve, but I don't know I've had sciatic pain before and I couldn't walk without using pain pills. This isn't like that. When I first get up I feel it or if I sit for long periods of time and then get up it hurts. When I am out walking I don't feel it at all. When I am sitting or lying down I don't feel it. If I am standing in line for something I feel it and it hurts. I see my MO in two weeks so if it hasn't subsided I will tell her we need to check it out. I will say I got steroids on the day of taxol infusion and the next day I didn't feel at all. My mind is not being nice and is thinking it's C. Thanks for any thoughts Nancy",

For the most part I am fine, but certain movements I can feel some pain/tightness. I am 2 years out from a lumpectomy and about 16 months post radiation. I asked my onc if the radiation side is more sensitive now and she did say yes, but she was referring to the bones. I've always felt some tightness after surgery and then early May I went to bed fine and woke up and had pain whenever I coughed, sneezed, cleared my throat, or took a deep breath it hurt. It's a lot better now, but I can still feel it when I cough or sneeze. I can't remember hurting myself although I did lift a 40lb water bottle, but nothing happened until the next morning. I had X-rays taken 2 weeks after it happened. They were fine. When I saw my onc a few weeks ago and mentioned it to her she offered a CT scan, but I felt it's gotten better not worse, but just won't go away. I guess my question is my surgery/radiation side has never gone back to normal so are we more prone to aches and pains?

I was originally told my tumor was 1.5 cm and I had 4 doctors telling me they didn't think I had any lymph node involvement . Well when the pathology came back I had a 2.8cm tumor and a 2.8mm ( what is it with me and that number 2.8?) tumor in one out of three lymph nodes. I also had LVI. Well phooey. I was originally told lumpectomy and radiation. Well chemo got thrown into the mix. You know what though? Chemo hasn't been as horrible as I thought and I feel very fortunate that I have handled it well. I still walk my two chocolate labs twice a day and I will be done with chemo Dec 30th. Yahoo Some chemo can cause neuropathy. The taxanes like taxol and taxotere. I am taking l-glutamine to hopefully keep it away. So far so good. I do have some annoying side effects but nothing serious. If you have any questions feel free to PM me. Hugs Nancy  ",

Don't panic ok - in other words don't go there until you get there. I wish I had listened to those words when I was diagnosed, but remember 80% of biopsies turn out to be benign. I will keep my fingers crossed for you. Oh and Dr. Google will freak you out. A lot of that info is outdated and flat out wrong. I should have stayed off Dr. Google - in fact my hubby asked me to step away from the computer because I caused myself a lot of grief. Hang in there. Is there anyway you can see if you can get the biopsy moved up? You can tell them it is causing you a lot of anxiety. They might try for you. Hang in there.
