    "Content": "Andie1366 wrote: I just noticed a large lump in my breast yesterday.  It is about 2 inches in length and is in the shape of an egg.  I went to the doctors today and am scheduled for a mamogram and ultrasound tomorrow.  I am quite scared, as I had some calcifications in the same area around 4 years ago, which were biopsied and found not to be cancerous.  I haven't had a mamogram since that time and am concerned that these calcifications have turned into cancer.  If anyone has any thoughts regarding my sudden large lump and the possible relationship to the calcifications, please let me know. Thanks. Log in to post a reply",
