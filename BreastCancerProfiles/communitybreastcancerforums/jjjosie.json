I was shaking an trumatized when I left the hospital. Three months later, I am still in pain in the same area.  I felt I was being tortured. I would have preferred to be sedated. I pray that no other women have to go through that kind of pain.  And the doctor and nurse said that it was unusual to have that much pain.  Well, maybe they should read this message board.",
