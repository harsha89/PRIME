She was in the hospital 5 days...after she threw up lots of blood (in her stool too). They gave her a Protonix IV and 2 units of blood. Then sent her home because her Platlets wouldn't go above 29 and her wbc was only 2.7, so they couldn't do the GI scope. Then last week she had that done and showed nothing bad, Praise the Lord. They said the low bc and meds caused the bleeding. Then last week they also took one and a half liters of fluid off her adomen which also came back normal..no infection or cancer. PTL.  Today's her first Ixempra (one every 3 weeks) with Avastin. Her hair has grown back some and she's not looking forward to losing it again. She's on the Fentanol patch so we're hoping that will help control any se. DH is somewhat better since he has realized the seriousness of stage IV. Her DD has a job at Sonic and is at home as little as possible and lives in DeNile. DS, 11 yrs, is still momma's boy but \"boy\" being the key word. God help us all if the doesn't take his medicine. Me, I'm still Kendra's steady rock....but if truth be told, she's my rock. I've never know in my 61 yrs anyone as strong, couragous and determined as her. Pattih, thanks for the info. Kendra is really tired alot and in pain from the spine mets (whick she had 12 rads for) and low blood counts already. She' come in every 10 days for blood work. Chanisawz, thanks for bumping the thread. Scary reading...but if anybody can get through it, Kendra can. She's gotten into her art and has just finihed an acrylic painting to submit to  the \"Oncology on Canvas\" book. She's also filling out the paperwork for SSD and to receiving half of her insurance benefits. She hoping to not have to go back to work. BC Sisters, thanks for your prayers and concern.

My intent is not to make anybody sad but let you share in my joy that she lives on in the lives of her family, and friends of which many of you here were! Kendra's last acrylic painting was of a dandelion for the Lilly's Art On Canvas Contest.  The new 2012 Book should be in your oncology offices. I was so excited they put it in. She mentioned you, her friends, as a source of her strenght. I thought you all might enjoy seeing it. God Bless you all, Glenda Kendra's Mom Log in to post a reply",

All that background to say last Friday's PET showed progression in her liver again so Monday he started her back on Abraxane/Avastin again because it worked so well for her. You gals here are a great source of imformation. It's wonderful going into the onc office already knowing what something he say 'means'. Knowing what he's talking about helps so we can ask the right questions. I've not heard of liver tumors pulsating causing scar tissue. What does that mean? I've not heard of 'pulsating' before.

The more you read here and your own research will help you to not be afraid of the unknown. I have found,  knowing just what we are dealing with gives us a lot of peace. So, you are welcomed here to ask questions and learn as much as you can so you can be a stronger advocate for your Mom. It's great having questions ready for her onc while you're there instead of thinkingof them after you leave. It's also great to have knowledge of what he's talking because you read it here.

I'm having a hard time keeping her down. She's not used to somebody doing stuff for her. I have to keep saying \"sit down, I'll get it\". I'm spending a couple days with her and family so she won't over do and has time to heal. Her onc. called today with Pet scan results and said her liver has improved. Her TM's are down to 92.8. Praise the Lord. She doesn't see the onc again until May 22, giving her time to recup before deciding her next battle plan. We really appreciate all you sisters and thank you for your prayers.

Since you said your energy is low because of tx, it might be good to go to the gym and do a little less, just to get you out of the house. But be careful not to lose to much weight. The side effects of tx may reduce your appetite and you may need a few extra pound to get you thru. My daughter had mets in her pelvis and had a hard time getting up in her jeep because it was too painful. Maybe later, if excerise gets too hard (or painful), you might want to freeze the account....but for now, if it's something you enjoy and it doesn't cause pain, you may want to keep it up. Building up the muscles around your bones is important.",

You and your brother are the reason she's so tough. She plans to watch her grandchildren grow up and be as proud of them as I am you two. You're a sensitive young lady and have been through more than your share of trails and heartache. But try to stay positive. Mom has a wonderful caring doctor. I sometimes feel as helpless as you do. Taking her to chemo helps me as much as it does her.  Continue to show her how much you love her and don't forget she needs her rest.  Being a mom and working 40 hrs. a week is hard enough when she's feeling good....one of the best things you do is laying in bed with her just watching tv, laughing and sharing your day with her. You are a precious young lady and I love you. Nonnie",

I can't stop thinking about River's family and dear Little Brother Bobby. Their pain is more real to me now. No words can express the pain I feel as I continue to \"be strong\". My heart broke even more, if possible, to read of Tony's loss. Mason was a special gal too. Why does it same like God comes for all the good ones? Isn't our hearts broken enough? When will the cure come? Kendra touch everyone who knew her with a beautiful spirit! Her onc and onc nurse came to the funeral home last night in tears. She, like so many other beautiful women, will be greatly missed. On a funny note...I need to tell you sisters that you guys answered all our questions so well and taught us so much...that twice this week people asked me if I was a 'nurse' because I knew what they were taking about and they didn't have to 'draw me a picture'.
