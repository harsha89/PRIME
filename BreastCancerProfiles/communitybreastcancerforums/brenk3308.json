I was taking a chance and googling, \"my JP drain is still draining too much\" and came across this.Although I am so sorry we are all having issues, it is nice to know I am not alone. I have surgery on Nov 7 with lumpectomy and axillary node dissection, (13 nodes), had a drain placed, then went back again on 11/14/2013 for a second surgery to clean up the margins of the tumor. I am waiting for radiation and chemo. I am so wanting to get this all over with! But this JP is truly holding me up. Tomorrow, I will meet my oncololy radiologist, and thought I cold stop by the Dr's and have this drain removed, but that's not going to happen. I think what concerns me more than anything, is, is my skin growing around this tube? and if so what in the world is it going to feel like when I finally do have it removed! I am still over 80 per 24 hours, although it does seems to be going down each day. I went back to work this past Monday after being out 2 weeks,and it was 130 that day!  It has gradually gone down, but I am not there yet...I don't detect an odor, but I sure think I need a new clear bandage and a new bottle. (this one has white sludge at the top!).  So anyway, I sure do sympathize with everyone, and I am glad I am not alone!!",

I did get good news, though, the tube he placed does NOT allow your skin to grow around, so no fear there!!! I ended up filling my little empty bottle (the drain bottle), with hot water, shaking the heck out of it, and getting that sludge out. If I must be stuck with it for a while, it's gonna be clean, darn it!!",

(guess I'll take that as a compliment). I asked if there was anything I could do to slow it down. He said the only thing he could think of was not to squeeze the bottle so much. In the hospital, I was told to squeeze and fold, then plug. The Dr. told me to just squeeze. So since Monday, I have come lower than the 80's and continue to come down (very slowly) each day. I guess it's like losing weight, better to lose a little then none at all? I am scheduled to have it removed and have the mamosite placed Dec 11th. IF IF IF the drainage is down.... ",
