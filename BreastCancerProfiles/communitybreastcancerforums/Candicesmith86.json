A few days ago I noticed a small (smaller than a pea) tender lump not on my breast but above it by a few inches. I am not sure how long it's been there bc I have not felt my chest. A few weeks ago I have a chest ct with contrast due to other things. My question is... Is that test good enough? I know if it were in the breast I would definitely need an ultra sound but being as it's more on my chest a ct would have picked it up had it been something of concern right? Log in to post a reply",
