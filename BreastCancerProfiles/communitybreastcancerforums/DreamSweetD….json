I know she's not a doctor but she is a registered nurse and she said that the doctor was pretty firm and confident about his diagnosis. I was thinking if things go smoothly I will wait until my next follow up? I'm under the impression that they will monitor me until I'm 35 and then remove it. (At least that's what I've read) I hate that I didn't ask more questions the first time but all I heard was \"We're not looking at cancer here\" and \"follow up\" in 6 months. He said a biopsy wasn't needed on either of them given their shape, mobility, \"look\", no history, and age. I know there's a chance that I could be misdiagnosed also, but I really think I'm okay. I'll ride it out at least for another couple of months if things go well. These specialist visits are around $700. Not cheap and insurance won't cover it, but better to be safe then sorry! I have to tell myself to stop looking up things about it because I think that's what makes me more nervous. I think everything's fine, but then I feel like if I go in all arrogant something will go wrong. Crazy line of thinking I know. Whatever happens, I'll be okay I'm sure of it! Thank you again ladies for all of your support and advice, I really appreciate it. P.S. Follow-Ups are basically like the first visit? Ultrasound and then you're ready to go?",

I will take everything you all said to heart and be cautious. I just had a wonderful day and I'm so blessed and thankful. You guys are really an inspiraton to me. P.S. This time I didn't flash him, I wrapped that gown thingy tight so the girls wouldn't pop out. Although it was difficult because the gowns are huge. Lol",

Everybody is telling me it will be fine, hopefully it will but it's just good to talk to people who have went through the same thing. alligans, the first tech I went to said mentioned it looked like there was debris, she never said the word \"spiculated\" though. She was very unpleasant to be around and made me feel like I had done something wrong. She told me my breast were very lumpy and it wasn't good that the lump was there. Obviously it's not supposed to be there!  Now the tech at the Breast Center I went to was so nice and encouraging. That's something I really appreciated. The specialist was \"certain\" that it was a fibroadenoma and if it bothered me I could have it taken out. He even told me that for my piece of mind I could have it biopsied but I was so relieved to hear it wasn't cancer I kind of blurred everything out from there.  I've been actually thinking about just having the one I can feel removed because it being there just bothers me. I'm just scared about the surgery.. It seems I'm scared about everything. >.< My gut tells me I will be okay, but I'm just afraid to be wrong.. That sounds so bad, I know. My mother had said if the doctor suspected anything remotely wrong he would of made me do a biopsy that first visit. We'll see what happens Wednesday!",

I guess I've been adding to my worry by googling everything under the sun about breast cancer. I'd like to tell myself though that if I'd ever be diagnosed it would be caught very early and hopefully wouldn't spread! That's what I tell myself to be sane. I'm thinking since both my family doctor and the specialist thinks it's fibroadenoma then it probably is. The ultrasound tech from the first ultrasound just freaked me out so much. Telling me it's not good that it's there and it looked \"dirty\". That's why I went to get a second opinion and it turned out good. If I need it removed how is the procedure and is it always necessary to be put to sleep? Like I said, I've only had one \"surgery\" and that was for my impacted wisdom teeth. All I had was a IV drip. Is it a long surgery? What is the \"recovery\" time? I was thinking about getting it removed just so that I wouldn't worry so much, but then I know there's a possibility of it growing back. They don't really bother me at all except a week or two before my period starts and after it starts it usually feels a lot better.",
