My sister had a BMX at age 37. She really liked him alot. Dr. Johnson told her that if she was his wife, that's who he would choose. A co-worker of mine had a doctor at St. Clair Hospital and was thrilled with her results as well. I believe she had the flap procedure. If you'd like me to find out her doctor's name, PM me.",

Well, they did get larger and now the bx HAD to be done. After repeated attempts, uncomfortable positioning etc, they finally got it! Guess what! He put the needle in my breast for the local and I passed out! I then pulled away from the machine when I got woozy. After I came to, they reattempted to locate the calcs again and could not. It was at that point he referred me to a top notch radiologist 2 hrs away because I was a \"difficult\" case. They had a machine that allowed the prone position with your breast hanging through a hole while you lay on your stomach. She described me as an \"interesting\" case. Anyhow, it went so much more smoothly. Still a little difficult to get to, but so much better. I did end up having a lumpectomy and there was again some difficulty getting the wire placed and the surgery took a bit longer but everything turned out well.  BTW, I am a nurse at the hospital that I had this done. Nothing bothers me and I have a high pain tolerance.

He told me the only possible side effect was some mild redness at the radiation site. I asked if fatigue was a possiblity and he emphatically said \"NO!:\" (That's not what my mother and aunt told me about their experience\").  They again told me to think about the clinical trial and call them back.

Everything has been fine until now. About 2 months ago I had swelling, redness, pain and the \"orange peel\" look in that breast for about a week. It eventually went away. Now it has come back. The breast is very achy and tingly with a mild burning sensation. There has been no change in my bras, detergent, or anything. So I finally called my breast surgeon and wastold he thinks it's \"radiation recall\" without seeing it. I can't get an appointment for several weeks.

I shaved it after #2 because it was really odd looking because it was growing so rapidly. I am now 7 days PFC and that hair continues to grow. It does look like peach fuzz, or really more like a baby ostrich look. I can see a bit of a 5 o'clock shadow coming in where the hair fell out. I'm really excited. Although I know it will be a while before I can be comfortable going topless, I know there's light at the end of the tunnel.  I was one that couldn't stand my wig. It cost approximately $300 (a gift) and wore it once to a wedding. I was so miserable, I left early. It was 100 degrees outside and it was very uncomfortable. My insurance (BC/BS) didn't reimburse me for it. I have worn pre-tied scarves and have received many compliments on them.They are very comfortable as well. I also had a meltdown at the wig shop. I think that's why I made a mistake in my wig decision.  I tried so hard to match my long, thick hair. I should have gone for a shorter, lightweight style. Divine's look fabulous!",

Well.........as my luck would have it, as soon as I went in the water, a huge wave crashed in to me and my scarf came off in the water! I immediately covered my head with both of my hands (I'm only 5 weeks PFC and look like a baby ostrich) and another wave crashed into me, knocking me over. My husband came to the rescue and was trying to cover my head with his hands. I was horrified!  Amazingly, the scarf returned to me in the surf. I put it on my head with a handful of shells, rocks and sand and hustled out of the ocean. I returned to our blanket covered in sand and rocks, scraped head to toe, crying.  Needless to say, I didn't return to the water today. I wish I was confident enough to go topless.....especially here at the beach!",

I had two clusters of heterogeneous microcalcifications on my mammo in December, one a Birads 2 and the other a Birads 4. They recommended biopsy for the Birads 4 and 6 month followup for the Birads 2.  Although it was uncomfortable, it was not painful. The local did cause some pain initially. That Birads 4 was BENIGN and was diagnosed as PASH (fibrocystic changes). 6 months later, last month, My Birads 2 cluster is now a Birads 4 because they have increased in size. Because of the location (close to the chest wall), they were not able to get to the clusters and referred me to a specialist 2 hours away. My appt isn't until July 6th and I'm actually less stressed this time because I know what to expect and because my last one was benign and had the exact same characteristics.  BTW...I have a VERY strong family hx.

      "Content": "rn4babies wrote: I got the call today that my bx was positive for DCIS. Unbelieveably, I had an appointment already with my surgeon. He is an excellent surgeon, but a general surgeon that does alot of breast surgery. Anyway, I got my report after the appointment and am confused on a few things that he didn't mention to me. Here is a synopsis: Part1:  Left breast; with calcifications. Duct carcinoma in situ, solid and cribriform types, nuclear grade 3 with associated calcifications and focal suggestion of comedo necrosis. Part 2:  Left breast WITHOUT calcifications. Scant fragment of atypical ductal epithelial hyperplasia suspicious for duct carcinoma in situ. COMMENT:  Part 2. Some tumor cells are fragmented and may be in a vascular space therefore the posibility of vascular space invasion may not be completely excluded.  The doctor did not mention the \"comment\" to me. Also, from what I am reading grade 3 and comedo necrosis can be related to a more aggressive type.   Does this mean there is a possiblility that there may be microinvasion? I asked if I could wait until the beginning of September to have the surgery as I have a 10 day vacation planned. He didn't think it would be a problem. My treatment recommendation at this time is lumpectomy with radiation. Am I making a mistake by waiting until September? BTW, it is Estrogen/Progesterone positive. Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.  First DX of DCIS on 7/7/11 of left breast. Lumpectomy with rads completed on 12/14/11.
