I know it must help to know that what you all are doing is working - and as a neonatal intensive care nurse of 21+ years, I promise that holding that new baby will definitely help you all know that the fight is well worth it.  Know that I will pray for you and your family as you go through this battle and will hope your little boy is born safe and healthy in about a month.  Thanks for keeping us posted and may I just let you know what an awesome husband and father you are being?  My boys are 25, 23 and 20....and if any of them turn out to be anywhere close to as supportive and compassionate as you obviously are - I will be SO grateful!  Your family is very fortunate to have you.  Liz ",

I have been asked by the hospital that I work for (small community 97 beds) to share my story for our Oct. 3rd Wellness forum with a focus on breast cancer awareness - as long as I can manage to pull it together by then...maybe some of what I have gone through to date might help someone else.  I know all of you have greatly helped me.
