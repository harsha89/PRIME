My husband and I just got married not even a year before all this. Talk about a huge test of commitment. I went into my diagnosis and treatments in denial. My husband, my mom and my 2 younger sisters have been my support system. I never really listened to the doctor. I believed I was estrogen negative at the diagnosis. I went for genetic testing because of my age. I am Brca1 positive and happilly can say mom and sisters are clear. Flew through aggressive chemotherapy. Wasn't too bad for me. I handled it really well. 6 months into chemo, went for my surgery decided to remove both breasts. Finished with 25 doses of radiation. Was suppose to go on tamoxin pill for 5 years but decided, to hold off for a lil while. Still confused why id be placed on that drug if im estrogen negative, but now my oncologist is saying im estrogen low....huh?! didn't realize there was a middle. Â Now I am 4 months cancer free and faced with another life challenging decision. Because of my age and the doctor placed me on Zoladex injections to make me menopausal during treatments, I will go through menopause much much younger than other women. I was told it could be weeks, months, or years from now. There are no tests they can do to tell me how long I will have before permanent menopause kicks in, because the chemo has hurt my eggs and ovarian function. Yay, thus my reason for not taking the tamoxin drug just yet. I want to start our family and put this behind me. Am I wrong for saying no to the Tamoxin drug? Anyone else young like myself going through similar situations? Anyone been on Zoladex and still nonmenopausal? Melinda Jackson Log in to post a reply",
