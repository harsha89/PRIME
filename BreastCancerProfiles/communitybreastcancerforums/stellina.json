It could be because since the breast could host a structure that unfortunately takes a life, you sort of don't miss it, since it was a source of such suffering and danger. But the hair, well, it just is sacrificed because the breast hosted the tumor. It's sort of a collateral and innocent victim. It is more touching.  Nah... It's because we are from a culture that associates women with (long) hair. Hair in a women is an ornament, I think it's in the Old Testament. And as you say, it's a very obvious thing, not easy to conceal. When our health causes us problems, we prefer discretion, yet a shaven head is like a huge neon sign pointing out our health issue. You know, a century ago medicine for typhoid fever or measels made the hair fall out... I found this when reading about the last tsar of Russia. Of his five children, daugther Tatiana lost her hair when she was curing from fever, there are photos of her with very short hair...  And here is a link with a picture of the five children of the tsar after they were shaven since they had lost their hair when treated of the measels.  http://www.freewebs.com/moonlight_tsarina/otmaa191... And here's one with the daughters of the tsar from the same period: http://i525.photobucket.com/albums/cc331/Tina_1812... Nowadays medicine has evolved. I know not all chemo medicine makes the hair fall out, but hopefully research will progress to the point where chemo will no longer make the hair fall out. Well, I'll know soon enough how my hair will behave. What's important is that I get this medicine to help me in my fight. And thank you very much for the hint with Nature's way, I hope I can find it, I'll memtion it to my onc, maybe she knows where and how I can get it. I already do scalp massages and started eating green fruit and vegetables... I just want the pixie head in spring!",

Besides, I was like a wig-junkie: I bought five of them different hair-styles, different colours... I had so much fun testing and discovering new looks. However, your hair grew back even if you didn't shave it, I understand. Did it grow slower or faster, was it even on the head between the areas that thinned out very much and those which thinned out less? I also am afraid to shave it because my scalp itches so much and is very sensitive whenever I touch it and even when I prop my head on the pillow! :( Sounds familiar?",

New here, I wanted to ask a question: I'm still in the middle of chemo so I don't know if it's time for me to comment here. But I have a question. At end of round 1 my hair thinned out and yesterday I had round 2 so I should go ancient Egyptian style this week or next or befor round 3. I cut my hair short, Louise Brooks-style. I was adviced to buzz it or even shave it. But when it started to come out, I found that it was easier to clean up the hair then looking for tiny stubble, so I left it as it is. Now to my question - sorry if it sounds silly, but I wonder: will there be any problems for the regrowth if I don't shave it?  Thank you for your kind replies and all the best wishes to you! ",

For the moment, I change my hair colour with my wigs, I have them in various colours and cuts, it's fun. But if I'll have to deal with them a whole year, I'll sort of get fed up with this kind of fun. I'm just anxious about having coverage, even though there are other issues to be considered with Herceptin as well. I'll just have to experience and see. ",

As far as my attitude is concerned, you should have seen me two days ago, I could have competed with an open water tap, that's how I cried. It's not knowing how I will react that's making me freak out and then I become the world's greatest cry baby. I did that before surgery, before chemo... If I didn't do it before Herceptin, one could accuse me of not being politically correct! OMG, I can't believe I make these jokes... Well, smiles and laughter are fantastic medicine and they're for free and always available...  All the best to you, warrior!",

      "Content": "Jan 12, 2014 11:38AM - edited Jan 12, 2014 11:41AM by stellina Hello, ladies! Pfc was on December 23rd, 2013 and hair is growing.  Here's the history of my hair's behaviour: October 21st, 2013 - first chemo session. I cut my 20 inch braid on October 24th - and kept it as a souvenir. The hair started coming out on November 5th and stopped about a week later. It never came out in chunks, just gradually. I would brush it several times during the day and that was how it came out. In a week my hair was so sparseo that I had to wear a wig.  Anyway the hair that did not come out in that week, sort of remained on the head. Even to this day, but these survivors are extremely few. November 11th, 2013 - second round of chemo. On November 14th, there are some dark tiny points on the scalp that's visible (how not all the hair came out, not all the scalp was visible). I didn't pay much attention because I thought it can't be the new hair. But one week later there were no doubts anymore, it was actually the new hair.  December 4th, 2013 - third round of chemo (should have been two days before, but was delayed because of low WBC), the top of my head sports tiny tiny tiny hairs. The sides are still nude, but then again, that's where the pre-chemo hair came out less. December 23rd, 2013 - fourth and last round of chemo. The top hairs have grown, the sides start to get moving, but the temples are still naked, it worried me a little. But it's filling in day by day, now 3 weeks after, scalp is still visible because the hair is very short and coverage is not complete. At any rate, it's fascinating to see how the process evolves. When there's hair on your head, you never have the chance to observe how things happen. So, at least this experience allows to see how things really go on. Now I start the Herceptin, which I'll take for a year. And I'm a little bit sad that there might be the possibility that my hair's growing rhythm might slow down. My onc and the nurses said it doesn't affect the hair growth. There are also patients that said that their hair grew normally. But on this forum and on the herceptin support group many complained about this side effect. Well, I must say that for each \"slow\" seems to mean something different.  I didn't suffer much at losing the hair to chemo, I knew it would happen and I knew it would grow back. I just can't make peace with the idea of a year of commando hair, should Herceptin really have this effect on everyone. I don't ask for length, just complete coverage and maybe one inch length in April. And, after all, hair growth slowing down doesn't mean that hair growth stops. Well, I'll just have to go through it and see how my body will react.  I know there is a hair growth during herceptin thread on the appropriate forum, but it,' less active than this one. Any Herceptin ladies here as well? Thank you and have fun with the fascinating process of hair growth. :-)  Fond greetings and stay serene!",

But I'm so happy about this walk, the sun was shining and a yoing couple was kissing, amd the air was silky soft... Oh, I can't explain it, but I just thought today is fantastic. I just wanted to share my onc's - the patient one - view about hair growth during herceptin - and it might help any lady impatient to have her head covered with hair. She told me that most of the patients had normal hair growth during herceptin, but a slowing down of the growth is however conceivable. She said that chemo and targeted treatment is after all a supplementary effort for our body and then its functions suffer its consequences. She said that treatments affect our system in general, but since oyher treatments don't affect hair this way, we tend to not to pay attention so much to the speed of hair growth. But, in a nutshell, I should not worry, my hair will grow back before I know it. Here I can't say anything, even taking off my wig was enough to surprise me that there is change from yesterday to today.  @ Donnabelle: your hair is wonderful, I can't wait to sport a head like that! My birthday is in July, maybe I'll be able to party with a head of hair like that! And I love how you always smile! @ Jumpy: did they let you keep your hands and feet in some coolers during taxotere-chemo? I saw on the wikipedia page of the drug how the lady on the picture was equipped with such coolers to keep her nails from eventually being affected by taxotere... That's why I ask. I'm glad to read your nails are restoring! @ littlecalico: thanks, I love history... And there are several more history celebs that sported bald heads as a consequence of health conditions or silly experiments.  Well, I too hope that cancer-fighting drugs will develop to be more targeted, more discriminating and causing less collateral - maybe even none - damage. And I'm sure it will happen, medicine and science progress as we speak. Scalp massages are an excellent suggestion, I started them as soon as the hercpetin request was approved about two weeks ago. I think I'll continue even when the hair is longer, it's pleasant and useful. I massage with the fingers and palms. Oh, I just saw we have the same diagnosis... Are you on herceptin alone, without the chemo? Ah, finally I ended up writing a novel again... :) Hugs and courage, girls, may the force be with us!",
