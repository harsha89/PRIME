He states in the report..none. Without comparison your chances of getting called back are always increased. Meaning the radiologist had no prior images to look at to compare to these images to see that this is just your breast tissue and nothing has changed. Architectural distortion means there's a disruption in the normal flow of your breast tissue. That doesn't necessarily mean theres anything wrong/ suspicious there. It could be just the way your breast tissue is. He called for spot images and possible ultrasound to make sure theres nothing there thats causing that architectural distortion. Assume this is because you had no camparison and try not to freak out! I know..easy for me to say! Its very common to get called back for additional imaging without comparison and it turn out not to be anything! Good luck!",

It will be 4 wks since i did my mammo and sono. I'm a mammo tech so imagine my surprise when a spiculated mass with microcalcifications popped up on my left breast. Oh damn i thought! I don't need a bx to tell me thats cancer! In 16 years ive seen more just like that than i can count! And the sono and radiologist just affirmed what i think. I pray that im wrong! About 4 percent i think of spiculated masses with microcalcifications are benign. I hope to be un that 4 percent. Me and my dr tried to feel this thing and couldn't which i fektngood about..but that tissue there has changed and its easy to feel which has me worried that its fast growing. The radiologist that read my exam admitted his partner missed it on my last mam 18 months ago. It was maybe 2mm and was only architectural distortion. I have some complicating health issues so i have no idea when ill have a bx or surgery. I have to be off blood thinners for 7 days before any procedure. Ive has a small stroke. I would like bmx and flap recon. Strong fam hx mom and sister at 39. Brother waiting on prostate bx. Psa 6+. I'm the only one tested and was neg for the gene but that was 20 years ago. My advice to you about a second opinion is find a dr nit connected to your dr in any way. That's the only way you'll get an opinion free of pressure or politics between drs. Drs cover for each other. I've seen alot in my 16 yrs and im not super trusting of drs in general. Ive always agreed with my patients..waiting is the worst. I never really knew what that meant!",

Then with the holidays no one did anything with it until jan 3rd. When they went to verify the specimen with the initial documentation sent on the 17th one of the numbers didn't mstch up. So they immediate called the pathologist and was able to determine it was my specimen based on a few other identifying criteria. So the test was never started..thank goodness..until they were able to follow protocol and use other forms of identification to make sure it was correct. They started testing on jan 4th. I wonder in your case if it had anything to do with the size of the sample. My oncologist said today that there are varying amounts of tissue in the block or slide. Sometimes not enough to complete the test and may have to request more. Sometimes there isnt more. Based on your 2cm you'd think there would be plenty. I'm so curious to see what our scores will be.

      "Content": "Dec 4, 2018 09:18PM - edited Dec 5, 2018 12:09AM by Cjzach10 Hi all! I went for follow up today and for my pathology report. The bs told me after surgery that when she injected me for sentinel node and got in their for dissection there was no sentinel node. And she saw no other dye uptake indicating any other lymph nodes. She took a section of tissue hoping to get lymph nodes. My report states there was no lymph nodes..only adipose tissue in the sample. So now I'm on to the oncologist for the oncotype dx. I know this test is suppose to be the tell all but it makes me very nervous that a lymph node wasn't sampled. She said its not common for this to happen but some peoples anatomy is that way. Either no lymph nodes or scar tissue blocked the path of the dye to that area. I just dont know how to feel about it. Trying to be positive...she could've gotten 5 lymph nodes and all be positive! On a positive note the ps said my healing problem was resolving itself and would just take longer than the other side to heal! So i was so excited to hear that! Good luck and continued healing to all my nov peeps!",

I went in on Monday to have a drain removed but my final path wasnt available yet. My next appt is Nov 29th. I have the same fear. My breast surgeon said she saw nothing that looked like positive lymph nodes. Buy we all know ya can't tell by looking. If theres a problem we'll face it head on. Thank goodness for the support on this site. Good luck to you!",

Pain in general in the area of surgery snd horrible back spasms. Honestly don't know which is worse. I know the drs have to tell you to get off the pain meds asap. But it's sort of had me down that i still need them. I've never taken them as often as prescribed since I've been home and continue to stretch the time out. But as someone earlier said i feel like im doing better overall keeping my pain under control because i can get up and move freely and feel stronger the next day. I did not have this whole thing in perspective as far as pain and how out of commission i woukd be for the first couple of weeks. I will be asking for a non narcotic thats stronger than otc. I'm tired of fighting this pain so hard and feeling bad that i need it to begin with. Thx",

Thise things you stated could be part of the history/indications of exam but there shoukd be alit mire than that. A pathology report is even more detailed.",

It's really nerve wracking meeting doctors for the first time.. at least the ones that will be treating me personally. I hope this surgeon will give me my options but respect my wishes. Im not the average patient that doesn't know at least some of what's suppose to happen. And its so very true..its different when its you! Thank you so much!

And if you mean smooth borders by perfect pea..smooth borders are also good! We do sterotactic bxs where i work and geez i never want one! Alot of docs are in a hurry and won't take the time to numb you up good. It's awful sometimes. Praying your bx comes back negative!",

Seems like breasts would have only been included in a scout. But... however they found it.. thank goodness! I do have 16 years of experience in mammography. As techs we don't like seeing additional work ups die to findings from a cut scan. But since you've followed up with what sounds like the usual protocol..diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound then biopsy it sounds like you've been recommended the right course of action. Anything with spiulations is very suspicious then add to that architectural distortion and theres a specific reason they want this area out. Sounds to me like the dr is thinking the area that was biopsied isnt the right one..disconcordant. Or some physicians are of the mind set that even if a biopsy comes back negative and it has the characteristics I mentioned it just needs to come out. The dr seems like he doesn't want to take a chance. In this case if it were me I'd follow his or her advice. Anything spiculated with architectural distortion is very concerning. If you have very dense breasts there could be a mass hiding in that tissue. Good luck with this! Om curious to find out what they find. Hopefully absolutely nothing!",
