Last night my wife told me she found wht appears to be a swollen axillary lymph node under her right arm. I have her trying to get an appointment with her OB asap. She was in for a breast exam with her OB back in september and everything was fine. We did get an ultrasound back in december of 17 on her left armpit but that turned out to be excess breast tissue from the recent delivery of our now 14 month old boy. Does this sound fishy to anyone? Is it worse if it shows up in the lymph node first without signs in the breast? Im just very worried and hope to get some advice. God bless you all Log in to post a reply",
