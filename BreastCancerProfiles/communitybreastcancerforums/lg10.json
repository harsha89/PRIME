How is everyone else doing?",

I can't feel it because of my mastectomy, but I am of course worried about infection. They gave me a prescription cream to use. Just wanted to see if anyone had any tips for the armpit area. It seems like a hard place to heal since it rubs a lot. Also wanted to see if anyone has experienced any pain/tightness in the joints in their hand? I'm meeting with lymphedema therapist next week to make sure I take care of any swelling early, but I almost feel like the pain I'm having it from inflammation in my joints not lymph buildup. Thanks for any feedback!",

The other 28 will be chest wall, nodes, and regional nodes. I am a little surprised about the treatments to my clavicle area, but the RO pointed to studies that say this is beneficial for high risk patients. I think my age (32) makes me high risk throughout this whole process, but also the grade 3/Her2 status. Just wondering if anyone else will or has had treatments to the neck area.. My CT will be on Monday and I bet I start the 13th or 20th.",
