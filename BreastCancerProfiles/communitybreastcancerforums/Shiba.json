I was diagnosed 23 years ago at a very young age and never volunteered for anything cancer related. I volunteered and donated to my personal passions and I think it's all an individual choice. I was diagnosed again (after 23 years!) recently with metastatic bc - in the bones/lungs - but have been having good results with treatment I received in Mexico. Organzations in this country have been doing a great job in creating awareness and conducting secondary prevention measures - but there are other approaches that really need to be incorporated more readily in our options for treatment. Involvement is all a matter of choice - no one should be worried or concerned about volunteerism. Taking care of yourself and doing the most you can to boost your immune system and find what creates joy is the most important thing at this stage... Shiba and Sparki (Sparki is in the picture). He's a hurricane Katrina survivor. Teaches me all I need to know about survival!",

I found a long thing lump near my collarbone and requested a mammogram numerous times and was denied because I was too young (this was in the 80's). I persisted for 6 months and then demanded an aspiration. Only after the results came back (which took 6 weeks b/c the doc went on vacation and didn't follow-up) did the finally do the mammogram. At that point - I had to have a modified radical mastectomy with immediate trans flap reconstruction. They didn't take me seriously b/c I was athletic and looked good. Even this time, went I went in for severe back pain - they told me it was a sprained back and sent me for PT. I asked for an MRI and was denied. PT made it worse.  In fact, the PT found a lesion and asked me to check it out - my pcare doc said it was just a muscle adhesion. The docs kept telling me how \"good I looked\". Months later I ended up in the ER b/c things were getting so much worse and they found multiple tumors in my spine. Twenty-two years later, widespread bone and lung mets.",
