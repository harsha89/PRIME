I have been suffering from the intense itch on my right side (the original cancer side), with no relief from scratching due to numbness..  I am glad to know that I was not alone (and that I am not crazy!)  My final bilateral reconstruction (tissue expander to implant switch) was January 2013, so it's been a year.  The itching is not constant, only once in awhile, but it's very intense.  So frustrating when no relief comes from scratching the area.   And thank you for all the suggestions.  I have been pinching myself till it hurt in the area near by the area to distract from the numbness.  I think the ice might work, and I will also try the cortisone and pepcid and the palmer coco butter bath...",
