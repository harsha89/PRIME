A Papillary Neoplasm (intraductal papilloma) can not be excluded. It had a additional comment stating: Although there is cohesiveness of the cells, there is worrisome  marked nuclear crowding and prominent nucleoli. Please consider excisional biopsy for final characterization. So I got a wire localization done as well as my excisional biopsy done on May 6th, and saw my doctor to see the area on May 8th. I had a IV sedation , and local anestesia for the procedure. I took a week off of work due to the first couple days my right breast was sore and had a lot of pain and lots of bruising. But till today I am feeling much better. Just anxious to get my results on May 22nd. I am little confused what else can it be if it is not a intraductal papilloma? You all will be in my prayers, God bless",
