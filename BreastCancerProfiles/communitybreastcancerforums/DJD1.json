I think getting my breast pressed is going to push me to the limit of endurance. I've heard of digital mammograms but don't know if insurance covers them. With digital they say you get your results in minutes which would definitely cut out the frantic worrying for days on end. I'm going to check into it before seeing my Dr. Fingers crossed.",

      "Content": "DJD1 wrote: A month ago I began having stabbing, pulling, burning pain with extreme swelling and reddness in my left breast. The pain is also under and down my arm, and feels like pressing into my breast bone. After I couldn't stand it anymore I went to the walk in clinic on a Sunday. The PA diagnosed mastitis, gave me keflex, and I left happy. I have now finished two rounds of antibiotics. The swelling has gone away, but my nipple is still red and doesn't look right at all. I am still having a lot of pain; my breast feels like it weighs pounds sometimes. At the time of my visit to the clinic I didn't notice any leaking or oozing. Yesterday I felt like I was oozing, and while getting ready for bed I saw some crusty material all over my nipple area. It isn't oozing like a true flow. The most I see is what is left behind and dried. I see my Dr. this coming Monday. She will likely send me for a mammogram, and maybe other imaging. I think the mammogram is going to hurt. My grandmother died from breast cancer when I was 10. My mother told me her family Dr. originally diagnosed her with a cyst. She only lived a few months after his diagnoses. I am getting more concerned by the day. I think what I need right now is to know if anyone else has had this mastitis? experience. I am 60 years old, post menopausal of course, history of fibercystic lumps. Thank you in advance. Log in to post a reply",

Neither have my aunts or sisters so I was kind of flapping in the breeze on my own, thinking bad thoughts. Thanks again for helping me over this hump.",
