I have 3 young children and was diagnosed with IDC, grade 2. There will be a lot of tests and discussions with doctors. The hardest part is waiting for the actual final diagnosis. It's been 32 days since my (initial)diagnosis and I still don't have a final stage/diagnosis. I, too, carry the fear of spreading. It is very common to have that fear. I tried to journal my feelings to get them out of my head. I used to cry just looking at my children and still do sometimes. It's ok to be scared. Once the test results start coming in, it will be easier to move forward. There are a TON of ladies on here who have SO much knowledge. This blog supported me during the diagnosis stage (and still does). Sending hugs your way tonight. Hang in there.",

I thought (and hoped) I would get to start chemo this month and have been reading this chat to prepare. I hate that we are all here but what a great bunch of women in this group. I have my appt with my MO this week to find out what my cocktail will be. I have a second opinion scheduled the following week. My SO said he would recommend ACT and I don't disagree. I am ready to start going on the offense!!! I plan to keep up with everyone's suggestions on helping with SEs. I am so ready to get started with treatment. I was strongly considering cold capping. But decided not to. I read a really good comment on here that I couldn't agree with more. I am afraid I'll stress more over the hair falling out than I would if it was just gone. Going to get some cute halos to wear under winter caps. May winter last really really long :-) Anyone else have small kids? We have 3. Looking for some tips on easing this process for them. Sending hugs to everyone here :-)",

They gave me two different anti nausea medicines in my port. Emend and something else. For the steroid, they said they will go ahead and give me the full dose and see how it goes. I'm wondering if the steroids are making me sick? I'm trying to drink as much water as possible and the nausea doesn't help at all. Ugh. I hate to be a negative post in the sea of good posts in our group. This has really knocked me down. Aside from the nausea, I feel kinda ok. Tired so I close my eyes but then my body won't sleep. They gave me scripts for zofran and if that didn't work, they gave me another for something stronger. I just took that one because zofran isn't touching it. Praying for it to work. Other than tha obsene level of nausea, today went off without a hitch. Received a neulasta box that will go off tomorrow afternoon. When did medicine get so progressive?? Did anyone else have EXTREME nausea the day of treatment? How did it get resolved? Trying to be strong and not lay in bed. And it's taking every ounce of me. Thanks to everyone for listening. Hugs to all. Hoping everyone's SEs are being gentle to them or nonexistent.",

Someone told me on here and I'm determined to pass it on m because it's amazing advice - the diagnosis process is long. And it's agonizing. Probably going to be the most nerve wracking time of your life. But it will get more manageable the more you learn. I was told that and never believed it at first. But now I do. With other illnesses, you go to the doctor and they give you a diagnosis and it's over. With this beast, the diagnosis process takes several weeks sometimes. Keep this forum close when in pain or needing to vent. It was my lifeline over the last several weeks. Sending hugs your way. Just know that you have this forum to help and comfort you.",
