It was a tough day yesterday. I brought them a sore, scaly, inflammed nipple. I knew this would be sore. I hope it's less sore when the drain comes out? Does that hurt? Thanks ahead of time.

I had a mammo that showed the inverted nipple, but no abnormalities. I went right to a surgeon to decide if per the report, which I received a Bi-rads 0, what I was supposed to do, as the report basically said to biopsy, ultrasound or MRI the area. The surgeon said to biopsy it. In my case, when you pull the nipple to EVERT out- it's bigger and looks quite different from the other nipple. This Dr. said it could be minor reasons it is like that to major reasons it is like that. He said that my nipple is a little scaly(which comes and goes), and 'inflamed'....The scaliness can have it's bad days- again- this is JUST on my nipple. So, I have gone back and forth whether to do this biopsy, but have decided, I will do it. I need to know what is going on with it.  They are going to put me to sleep for it on Monday am. So, I am 37, no family history on mom's side...HOWEVER- my mom- herself, JUST found a lump last week... Thanks. Gail        ",

He did 'correct' the inverted nipple, as it was stuck in there pretty tight. I wonder if that has something to do with the inflammation/scaliness of the nipple, when you take it out and it isn't an 'innie' anymore?   ",

      "Content": "GRB wrote: Hello. I had some questions. I admire all of you for what you go thru, and hope - as going thru what you go thru, you could answer some of my questions. I have an inverted nipple. It has been like this for some time. Hubby says not forever though, and - well- I believe him. My inverted right nipple is INVERTED. You can get it to come out, however- it just puckers right back in. There is a different 'look' about it. It looks quite different from my happy left nipple, as I call it. It has some dry skin on the nipple ONLY. No dry skin on areola- it's just on nipple. Also, it appears to me as it's either a cyst(as it's quite mishapen) for a montgomery gland- right on the edge of where my nipple seems to invert. This 'cyst'(as I think it probably is) appears to be getting larger- however- it's a little scaly, but not painful. This particular area is where I think I really feel there is a different \"look.\"  I am 37, no history of breast cancer on mom's side of family. My father's mother had bc, and had a masectomy, however she died yrs ago of heart failure not related to the bc. I have had a diagnosic mammo 2 weeks ago, which noted my very inverted nipple, but no masses or calcifications.  The radiologist was honest with me that sometimes we don't see things in mammo's. I go on Monday to a surgeon, as I got a BI-RAD score of 0, and further assessment is needed. My GP wants to send me for ultrasound. The report left it open for a biopsy, ultrasound, or breast MRI. I frankly have never had a biopsy on anything, but would probably opt for that if that could tell us something that we may not see with an ultrasound. Living in a rural area, I have to go North a bit to a surgeon whose office is right next to hospital, so I am hopeful he can give me some direction with this. And, in addition....- when they recommend an ultrasound in addition to the mammo- will they ultrasound both breasts or just the questionable one? Thanks ahead of time. G Log in to post a reply",
