I'm cold capping, running, acupuncturing, ayurvedaeing.... And driving my doctor crazy in the process. Regarding my diagnosis, I am stage 2a, 14mm tumor, had lumpectomy, sentinel removal and micro mets 2mm on a node. I am also her2 triple possitive so I'm throwing the book at it. I'm doing TCH 6x every 21 days. For the first infusion I had heartburn, constipation and diarrhea, and was truly down only one day. The other two I stayed in bed because i was sad. For this round I'm a bit more emotional because i began what is called \"the big shed\" in cold capping, I'm thinning some and I just hope it stops soon, also my boyfriend has a cold so he is staying away and I'm on my own. Prior to diagnosis I was vegan, I am now a vegetarian who eats eggs, kefir and the occasional fish bone broth. I am also a fan of clean food and products, so I try to incorporate that to my treatment. I will be on lupron for two years, herceptin for a year and Hormonal therapy for 5-10. Such is life. I wish all of us the best. ",

I've been drinking fresh aloe in one of my smoothies every day, with chia seed, coconut water, raw honey and hemp milk for the fires, and I've been on the distilled aloe for years ;) for the past 20 years I've kept all medicines at bay unless super sick, so chemo hit me like a freight train I guess, I had never in my life experienced such a horrible feeling!!! I second your motion for essential oils! Just stay away from Lavander as it mimics estrogen, a shocker and very inconvenient truth for me as I adore the smell and had already purchased a year supply of the stuff.... I've moved on to bergamot which I even use in my deodorant and as antiseptic. So far I'm managing the side effects pretty well, except this damn insomnia. Please God! 6 consecutive hours, I beg you!!!!",

I use organic, cooking coconut oil and I just take a swig of it first thing in the morning and move it around my mouth gently for 20 minutes, then spit it out in the trash ( not the toilet or the sink because it may damage the pipes)rinse and brush with a very soft brush. I've been doing this on and off for years, it was disgusting at the beginning but it's really good for your mouth ;) good luck and I hope you feel better. Also try to suck on ice during chemo, many women swear by it.",

This time I got a prescription for omeprazol for my burning insides, some pro-biotics and a laxative for the first 4 days, and I felt way better. Yesterday and today I feel like I've been run over by a truck, but I was able to cook, shower, and laugh. My body aches like crazy but I have more energy than yesterday, hope to progress nicely in the next three days. I wanted to share with you that I've been oil pulling with coconut oil and I have not had any mouth sores. For those of you not eating, you have to find the way... It's so important to eat. Look into smoothies to make it easy, but please eat as our bodies need us to be as strong as possible for the battle. Hope everyone is having a symptom-free evening :)",
