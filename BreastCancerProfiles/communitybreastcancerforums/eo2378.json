One of the areas is a grade 3 and hormone receptors positive, while the other a grade 1 and hormone receptors negative. The 2 areas are approx 5 inches apart from each other.

I went back and forth with between that procedure and the tissue expander, ultimately decided on the TE. I would have had to go from a G /F cup size to approx B with DIEP. I definitely was okay with reducing my size, but without the presence of my left arm, I use my breasts alot to help in my day to day. I just wasn't sure that a B would be enough to help me out, so I opted for the TE. I'm happy to hear you're on the road of wrapping up your experience.

However, for those who are positive this is definitely something to consider and do your research just to be on the safe side. Skiboots42, I was experiencing that same exhaustion prior to surgery. I could have slept all day long and it still wasn't enough to give me a normal energy level. Since surgery, I have noticed a huge improvement with my energy. I've been walking daily, eating foods that naturally increase energy, and resting when I feel tired. I didn't walk yesterday and I noticed that I felt more exhausted than I have in the past week.

I was having that same tightness in my chest earlier this week. I was thinking there's no way I can manage to deal with this until my implant exchange surgery! I've felt a huge improvement with this over the past few days. My oil friend told me that \"morphine bomb\" combo helps reduce inflammation. It makes sense that our bodies are inflamed after such a major surgery. I've been applying topically and also taking in the caps, not taking any pain meds, and I'm feeling almost 100%! I've also been eating very healthy and healing foods. Lots of veggies and protein. I don't know if it's a combination of both diet and the oils that are helping, but I feel great, so I'm definitely going to continue doing what I'm doing. My oil friend suggested that I put 2 drops of frank under my tongue every day, so I've also been doing that. I'll be honest, it's an acquired taste, but I'm open to any suggestions that might keep me cancer free and in good health! My appointment went well, thanks for asking! I didn't take any pain meds before, but I did take a capsule of the oil combo. I had the wound vac and one of the two drains left removed. I felt ZERO pain or discomfort! I'm a big baby, and have no pain tolerance. My friend had also given me a roller she calls \"hot mess\" to help with anixtey. I tend to get very anxious with just the thought of possibly having pain, and that didn't happen today. The PS was very pleased with how I'm healing and how well I handled the wound vac removal. He was a bit concerned with my skin being too thin, from the years of weight of my breast, to be viable. Fortunately, the skin is doing better than he'd expected and seems to be very viable. The last drain has to stay until next Friday. Not because of the output, because it's the drain that is going to the TE. Apparently 2 weeks with this drain provides the best results with the aladerm success. I'm feeling much better now than when I was taking the pain meds. My range of motion has improved drastically in the past few days and the tenderness from the SNB is almost nonexistent. The pain meds made me so fuzzy and tired, so I'm happy to be feeling comfortable and clear minded. My incision sites aren't very tender. I'm applying my roller right over the incision site when I do dressing changes. Maybe this would be an option for you if you're having difficulty swallowing the pill form? Or possibly frank or Copaiba under the tongue would helpful too? Looking forward to hearing what you try and if you find any relief from the tightness feeling!",
