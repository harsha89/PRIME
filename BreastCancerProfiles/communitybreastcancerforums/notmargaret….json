      "Content": "May 16, 2018 05:38PM notmargaret wrote: Hi All! I am in the midst of Pallas Cycle 6. Here's what I've experienced with side effects: 1. My absolute neutrophil count has been consistently low (range .79 to 1.3). I had to take a one week break from the palbo when I dipped to .79. Most recently, my ANC was just over 1.0. If I dip below 1.0 again, they'll lower my palbo dose. 2. My hemoglobin was lower than normal for the first 5 cycles, but has rebounded to normal range. 3. My platelets have bounced around between lower than normal and normal. 4. My white blood count has been consistently below normal since starting the palbo. 5. During Cycle 4 or 5, I had 7-10 days of nausea and light headedness. I told my doc about this, which resulted in a brain MRI that was normal. The nausea and dizziness is gone now. 6. My post-chemo hair and nail growth has been super slow since starting the palbo. 7. At the end of each cycle, the back of my head gets super itchy. 8. I have periodic hot flashes. 9. My joints (feet especially) are very stiff and sore when I get up after sitting or lying down. 10. I've been having some bouts of constipation during the last two cycles and some lower abdominal twingyness. Now you all know way too much about me. Hope this is helpful. Please know that nothing about the above list makes me want to quit. The side effects have been manageable. notmargaret",

My blood counts have been persistently low from the outset, neutrophils hovering around the 1.0 mark. I did dip below that a few cycles ago and had to take an extra week off. The next time I dip below 1.0, they will lower my dose. As for other side effects, they've been manageable, but not nothing ... My hair doesn't grow much at all, so my short post-chemo pixie might be permanent for awhile. I have noticed some hair loss lately, but not enough that anyone else has noticed. A bit of constipation if I don't keep my fluid intake up. Some fatigue. I find myself sleeping in in the morning more than I used to. A few mouth sores. Definite joint pain, especially feet, if I sit still at all. Could be the Anastrozole. Some headaches. Some UTI-like symptoms. Hope this helps. ",
