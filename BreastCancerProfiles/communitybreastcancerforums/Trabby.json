Do you need to be monitored for the fibroadenoma's? Just the mere thought that you may have cancer is an absolutely hidious feeling and until you are in that place noone really understands. Thank god we have this site! The understanding and compassion here is far more effective of an outlet than anything I can think of. I am so happy that you now have the answers that you needed.

I had an ultrasound in April which didn't show the lump, however they found a small cyst. I was booked for a recheck after 3 months. Two weeks ago I has another ultrasound, and today I had my follow up. Ultrasound once again did not find the lump, the cyst that was there 3 months ago is no longer there. They did however find two new cysts and an abnormally large auxiliary lymph node. I am now booked for an ultrasound guided core biopsy on Monday the 8th. So that has me pretty nervous at this point. How can I best prepare for this? I haven't googled the procedure as of yet, just read the handout they gave me. Also is it normal to biopsy the node rather than yank it out???

I had my first ever breast exam a little over a month ago , she found nothing and once again my tenderness is apparently due to hormones because im 31. She also said that breast cancer on my dads side of the family is not overly relavent because it comes from maternal side. My dads mom had a large benign lump removed from her breast and uterus. Her mother and aunt both died of breast cancer. My dad's dad, has two sisters both whom have had reoccurent breast cancer. How can this have no relavence? I asked  at my last appnt, for a referral to the breast health clinic only to be told that it was for people who  needed it . My tenderness is non cyclical and I have now found a lump ( lymphnode? ) on the outer edge/ rib area of my breast that is also tender but not the original tender spot.

I have had two ultrasounds in the past two years neither has shown \"the lump\". Me, my husband, family dr and ultrasound tech can all feel it. I was told that my right breast is denser than the left and it's most likely due to hormones and age related changes is the breast. Two years ago I requested a mammo after the clear ultrasound, apparently they will not do a mammo because I'm in my 30s and that breast is dense. The latest ultrasound although it didn't find the lump they found a 3x2x5 cyst which I was told is too small to do anything with. So they are going to see me again in 3 months...... So now this brings me to paternal family history..... From the very beginning of this I was told family history only counts on my moms side.... There is no breast cancer on her side. My fathers side however does have breast cancer, both his moms side and fathers side...... I spoke with my great aunt today who is a breast cancer survivor. She has had two recurrences and has had both breasts removed..... She urged me to press this issue..... Her initial lump did NOT show on mammo, did NOT show on ultrasound. Needle biopsy came back OK. She personally wasn't happy until she sought a second opinion. It was then she was offered to have it taken out.... Two days later she was diagnosed with invasive cancer. I cannot understand why my dr is soooo adamant that his side of the family's history doesn't matter. Last time I checked I believe i inherited half of my DNA from him. How do I go about getting the answers I need? I just want to know exactly what this is..... I feel like I am being dismissed and discriminated against because of my age......

The most frustrating thing about this is that they can't tell me what the lump is. There's so many things other than cancer that it could be and probably is...... I just want it to have a formal name. Over the last few years I have really lost faith in the medical system..... They preach early detection but impose all of these guidelines that either open or close the door to full assessment of the problem. Also there is not a single female dr in my city who will see new patients, I'm a little hesitant to walk into some strange male dr's office and whip out my boob on the first visit. I find it very Unnerving that my great aunts cancer was missed by us/mammo and biopsy.... Luckily she got her diagnoses after she had it cut out.",

I even asked if my lump could be related to my sore lung as they are on the same side. But in typical fashion she dismissed the boob and asked if I have quit smoking yet. Of course I haven't!!! I have 3 kids one of which is chronically ill. None of them get along.... Not to mention the rest of lifes stress!!! If I didn't step outside to smoke I'd lose my bloody mind! So she listened to my chest, looked in ears, nose and throat. Said\" you look healthy \".... now I'm on a puffer for two weeks to see if it helps. If not then I have a requisition for chest X-ray. Whether I feel better or not in two weeks I'm going for X-ray.",

I was going to phone my regular dr too but then realized she can't do shit for me at this point hence the reason I finally got the referal in the first place. GRrrrrr, my hubby thinks I worry to much and that its all gonna be fine and I will be told that I'm fine at my appnt. I tried to have the what if conversation with him but the topic somehow got changed and that's where it sits. I told my mom when I found the lump and she has never inquired into it again. I sorta feel like everyone thinks I'm nuts or something...and its not like I sulk around dwellin g on my tit 24hrs a day. Thank god I found you ladies, whether it is all B9.

The distractions seem to be adding up :) in regards to Mary.... My Dad said that without he believes he would have died!! Bizarre I thought but this is what he told me.... His first couple treatments. He was so sick that he literally puked and sweat 10 pounds off. He felt like he had been poisoned. Then his buddy offerd to drive him to and from chemo....he brought WEED. Apparently my dad smoked it in the truck on the way home.that was the key, he said if he smoked right after chemo B4 the vomit and sweating and chills ect started... The side effects were manageble and he was hungryand able to eat.So as weird as it was. My parents explained to me that dad was smoking pot and it was helping his cancer.my mom would roll joints for my dad on chemo days b4 she caught the bus to work.he confided this with his chemo nurse and she said it was fabulous that he was managing so well.not only did my dad beat his cancer, he did not loose his hair and he managed to stay somewhat healthy through the ordeal. I don't know if the results are the same for everyone but I. Know for some its definately worth the try. Marshmellow where in our beutiful country are you? I'm in southern alberta. Geoshanna if I knew I was going to loose my hair I would go with a bizzare doo too pink mohawk?? Lol something crazy...why not?? Anyways I hope everyone has a great day!!",

I see my dr on sept 2nd for my complete so my boob will definately be a topic of issue.I plan on asking for a third time, for the referral she won't give me. I really can't wrap my head around the fact that my lump didn't show on the US, yet I still feel it.regardless of what it is I need answers. If she won't provide me with the referall this time I will be scouting a second opinion from somewhere?I did read however from mulltiple sources that cysts always are visible by US, so my fear is that this is not something as simple as a cyst. Are there lympnodes @ 9oclock?",

I recently have posted on the not diagnosed but worried forum, but in my travels through the site ( great site by the way) have found myself here. My ultrasound is schedualed for the 19th @12:45, I cannot quit thinking about it. I have had a stomach ache since tuesday when my dr also felt my  lump. And believe me I have groped my own boob in the last 4 days more than it has probably ever been touched. I guess I am hoping that the lump or the tenderness is gone.......its not in fact i think i can feel lympnodes as well. I really really hope, and after all the statistics are in my favor that this is just some freakish thing that is b9 and I will have nothing to worry about. but WHO KNEW that even as small as 20%   out of 100% could wind your clock so tight and fill your mind with the random thoughts of what if? Afterall this issue with my breast that has been since may of 08 , exept the lump is new. I am a very shy girl especially with my breasts, so believe me actually going to the dr and talking  to her about it ect has been really hard. Letting some stranger US my boob next week is almost one of the worst things I have had to do. The length of time that this has gone on only to be told that I am hormonal , but now to find a lump has me terrified! Log in to post a reply",

My parents were very open with the fact that my dad was smoking marijuana... It was weird.
