I have to have radiation treatments to the scalp and continue on the herceptin weekly and zometa once a month. Your wife is in my thoughts and prayers and we have to stay stong and fight and hope that the herceptin works, most feel that it is a miracle treatment. It's tuff but please insist that they have it checked, but she is already on the herceptin and that is truly a plus. I will be keeping positive thoughts for both of you.",
