Since I was unlucky enough to be in the 10% group who are triple negative, I won't have any more treatments or hormone therapies after rads. I got so much help and support from the January 2010 chemo board, and I am looking forward to meeting all of you ladies. A little about me: age 53 (just had my birthday on Thursday - and got tattooed to celebrate! - JK, that's when I had my simulation and had the 4 tattoo placement marks done). I live a bit north of Seattle, and have a job that normally requires me to fly 3 weeks out of 4, so being grounded since Jan. has been a real adjustment. I have been on STD since Jan. 6th, but will go back starting tomorrow and will try to work through radiation. Are any of you ladies doing the same? Aimee",

Have to admit I am obsessing over the slow pace of its return. I don't think I have seen a change at all in 3 weeks, although my husband says he can see more there. The front and sides of my head still seem almost bare, but I have about 1/8\" sprouts toward the top and some in the back.  How are your rads going? I got really depressed at the beginning, because it seems like such an uphill climb, but I am marking every day off on my appt schedule and trying to be positive about the progress. I have had 3 treatments, and today my breast is beginning to feel a little bit tender. I was hoping that wouldn't start so quickly, but I guess whatever is bound to happen will happen.

I used to wear a knit cap around the house and a wig when I went out, but now I put on the wig as soon as I am up just to tell myself I look normal - and I am probably one of the least vain people on the planet! My family has been using humor to get through as well. When I first lost my hair my son, who has moved back home (he's 23) walked by me one day and said \"I'm sorry Superman keeps foiling your evil plans Mom\" and started calling me Lex (Luther). Now he tells me that I should try to sneak a spider into my radiation appointments so it will bite me and turn me into Spidermom! Did I mention that he is 23? Anyway, laughter makes it more bearable. I'm going in for rads #5 tonight after work, but next week and for the duration I will be doing 8:10 am.

Maybe that sounds overly dramatic, but these emotions are uncontrollable sometimes, as you well know. The techs were very understanding, and I had to take several moments to compose myself in the changing room before venturing outside. Stopped at the grocery store on my way home, bought a $2 scratch ticket (won my $2 back with it), and got a big variety pack of Mike's Hard Lemonades.

I am at 22/33, and the pinkness that used to go away by the end of the day stays and gets worse as the day goes on. This road seems incredibly long, and even with 11 left (including 5 boosts) I still have to mentally gear myself up for going in every morning - and it's only 5 minutes from my home. I get a mini bout of depression every morning, and am glad that I start working in my home office at 9am to keep my mind busy, or I would stay in that valley all day long. Just a heads up to that my RO said that week 5 is really the critical one for keeping the breast as dry as possible to avoid blistering and peeling. Since I am 52 with big floppy breasts, the area under my breast where the skin touches skin is hard to keep dry. If anyone has any suggestions on how to do that please let me know! Usually I put on the aloe gel and lay with my shirt off and my arm over my head until it dries, but during the day it's hard to keep moisture away. Don't want to think about blisters - it's getting uncomfortable enough as it is.",

Only one is really growing, and we are going to treat that with radio-static ablation sp? the other she wants to take a \"wait and see\" approach, and says it could be months or years before she would want to start chemo, since I am otherwise asymptomatic. She says she can't give me more life, but can give me more time not having side effects. That does and doesn't make sense to me. Anyone advice?",

I am really thinking about getting a second opinion, but am seeing the interventional radiologist this afternoon to better understand the ablation issue. From what I gather about the procedure, it is similar but a bit more invasive than a biopsy, but the needle/wire carries a current that pretty much fries the tumor.  In terms of the chemo, it just seems to me that with millions of cancer cells now running free through my bloodstream chemo might kill off a lot of them and keep them from meandering to other organs. Plus, I think I tolerated chemo pretty well (Taxotere/cytoxan), and it sounds like there are fewer side effects with a singular chemo protocol. It's so great that you and your son have such a good relationship. I have two daughters, 23 and 29, and a son who turned 26 in January. He is moving back home at the end of the month more due to job loss, but has really been trying to help with things around the house as well as with keeping our spirits up. He keeps me from being too morbid. Typical scenario yesterday, in one of my low points I asked him if he would want to give my engagement ring to his girlfriend Hollie someday after I'm gone. He replied \"shut the F up mom - you're not going anywhere soon.\" ",

My 26-year old daughter came to visit from NYC on Sunday,. she just broke up with her boyfriend of 9 years and had to move out of their apartment. I am glad to have her here while I am on my \"up\" days, but I am not sure about how I feel about her helping me through round 3. Is it weird that I don't want her to see me suffering SEs?

Thank goodness for this new drug - any ladies out there experiencing the restlesness and jitteryness please ask you doc about it.",

When you meet with the RO they will probably go over your pathology report and he or she will give you information about radiation, including SEs, the likely (burning, fatigue), and the very unlikely (lung damage, broken rib). Your RO will cover what your treatment will consist of, and you will be scheduled for your simulation appt, where you will get measured and maybe tattooed (not a big deal) or have taped marks. The wierdest thing for me was having so many people looking at my boob in one day, and all the pictures they took of my boob at different angles, and my face (they always had my face and report on a computer screen when it was my turn for verification.) In terms of questions, I would just make sure that you feel comfortable with your RO, but you will probably be seeing the radiation nurses and technicians a lot more frequently.. Usually you see the RO once a week, but I had much more interaction with the nurses. They were the ones I talked to when I needed prescriptions for anti-anxiety meds and for ambien. They will also give you prescriptions (or free samples) of the lube products they recommend. I used an aloe gel they gave me, as well as aquaphor, but each RO has their own recommended products. Please PM me if you have more questions or just need to vent. I personally founds rads more emotionally difficult.",

It's okay not to be brave and always put on the happy face. This sucks big time and it's okay to say it does. It's hard for many of us to say we can't do it all as we used to, and to ask for help is not within our nature, as we are the ones who are always helping others. I have come to realize that telling people what you need in terms of help is a gift to them, as so many want to do something and they are helpless as to what that might be. so if you were to ask a friend to do something specific for you, it gives them a way to help. I have a friend who brings me my favorite caramel macchiato on the day she starts work late, and we have a few moments to chat. I am not up for lots of company, but those 30 minutes are a godsend, and my connection to the outside world. My sister has pledged to bring us dinner on my chemo days, and I am already looking forward to that this coming Thursday. I think crying is a healing process, and I put on sad country songs and let it go. While my hair was falling out I played \"skin\" by Rascal Flatts and cried my eyes out, but felt better afterward. when I was first diagnosed, I played Martina McBride's \"anyway\" and again the crying was therapeudic. I still very guilty on the days when my husband comes home and I tell him I haven't done a thing all day but sit, sleep, or take a long shower and nap. He asks me \"did you heal?\" and when I say yes, he tells me I accomplished all I needed to today. He is my rock. I also try to keep a sense of humor with my kids, so they know that while this sucks, we don't have to be afraid of talking about it. I wondered how my adult son, who recently moved back home, would deal with my newly bald head, but when he walked by me sitting on the couch and said \"I'm sorry Superman keeps thwarting all your evil plans Mom\" I knew he was okay. :)",

I don't know why I did this, but I spent day 2 sitting around waiting for side effects to happen - dumb, dumb, dumb. Now I am up and around, but moving a little slower. I was told by the onco that this was the best course of treatment since my BC is triple negative - so should respond to chemo better. I did go to the Look Good Feel Better meeting a couple days after my lumpectomy, and picked up lots of high end makeup and a free wig. Next week I am going to check out a place a few miles north that will fit me for a free wig. I probably won't lose hair for about 10 more days, but I am not yet comfortable with the whole bald thing yet. One of my good friends is going to do a portrait of myself w/my husband next week, while I still have my hair.

I passed my 1 year diagnosis day on 11-11-11 and had a NED follow up mammogram a year to the day of the one that changed everything. Been back to work since the end of March, but grounded from my flying job during radiation. Knew I was BAA-ACK once I started flying again. Feel like I am maybe 90% back, but I know that chemo brain is a real thing, and not a joke. I wonder sometimes if disclosing to my boss that I forget more than I remember sometimes would be the worst thing I could do in my job or might offer some disability-related job security. Not going to take the chance right now of talking about it. I had a very disconcerting appt. with my oncologist, who's follow up plan for me is left side mammo every 6 months and both sides every year. No scans unless I have symptoms. Her rationale? My type of BC (triple negative) has only a 3% chance of recurring in the breast, and once it's found outside the breast it's no longer curable and at that point diagnosis wouldn't alter my length of survival. I know that that is true but still sounds like pretty cruel logic. (I plan on faking symptoms every 6 months or so.) I was freaking out for way too long with back pains that were mild  but wouldn't go away. Talked my regular dr. into ordering an MRI, which came back clear (and after that the pain seemed to go away!) Am back to being in a different town each week leading group trainings in front of rooms of people who at this point think that my short hair is \"cute.\" Honestly, it's almost back to the length it used to be, only a different texture. It is hard to believe the difference a year makes, and how now I can go several hours at a time without thinking about BC. Hopefully some day soon entire days will go by that way!  I hope all of you are doing well and feeling confident about the future. Would love to hear from you all.",

Someone gave me this advice - instead of thinking of the chemo as poison that will hurt you, think of it as a magic elixir that will heal you. That statement changed my thinking, although it's hard to relate to when and if nausea hits you. Looks like you are loaded for bear and ready to go! let us know how it goes for you on the 21st - I'm hoping that it is easier for you than you now imagine.. Aimee",

My avatar picture is at about 8 weeks, The first 8 or 9 weeks were a horrible watch and wait time, and for me losing hair has been the worst part of this whole mess (I know that sounds vain, but I really only felt sick when I looked at my bald self.) I work at home, and found I had better days when I put on a wig, even when I was by myself. but a funny thing happened a few weeks ago, My husband said he likes me better without the wig, because \"it is me\" as he says. This weekend was the first time I was out in public without my wig, when we went to the pool at the hotel we stayed at. there were kids in the pool and adults in the hot tub, and I was ready for stares, but no one even gave me a second glance! It made me feel more powerful in some strange way. This weekend is our local Relay for Life, and I signed up to walk the Survivor Lap which begins the event. Pretty sure I feel comfortable now to do that topless! Don't worry, it will come in. I'm going to Vegas at the end of August for my daughter's 21st birthday, and I plan on leaving the wigs at home by then!",

At the time, it was impossible to imagine there would ever be a day when I would have a full head of hair again and be back to work full time. So please, hang in there and even though it might get worse before it gets better, when the SEs and the fears fill your body and brain and you wonder how you will get through the next hour, know that there will be a time not far away that you will look back on this relatively short period of your life and hardly believe that it happened.

I received my Stage IV diagnosis at the beginning of the month, have 5 nodules in my back but only 2 lighting up on the PET scan. My doctor wants to take them out with radiofrequency ablation (basically like a biopsy with radio frequency that pretty much fries them). And I'm cool with that. BUT she says that other than that I am asymptomatic and she wants to hold off on chemo for as long as possible - months or even YEARS and just watch and see if any of the other nodule are cancerous. She says she can't prolong my life but can prolong the length of time I don't feel sick. I am going for a second opinion from another treatment center. I also have an option to participate in a Phase II clinical trial that combines Abraxane and Avastin, but the side effects sound so numerous and awful. I handled chemo okay the first time through. Have any of you had experience with these two, either singularly or in combo - and what kind of SEs to you have?",

Decided to get back on and here you are! I am in the middle of applying for SSDI, and to echo the other ladies, a stage IV diagnosis is pretty much an automatic approval that is pushed through in a matter of weeks instead of months (after they get your medical records). I am a few years younger than you, so don't know about the medicare stuff. I was also told that your benefits would start 5 months after your last day of work, and you will retroactively receive benefits if you have been off work longer than that. I went out on disability May 3rd, so will be paid for November forward. However, I have been receiving LTD benefits during this time, so I think I have to hand that check over to Liberty Mutual to recompensate them for what they have been paying me. I am glad to hear that the clinical trial we talked about several months ago seems to have been good for you. I have had gamma knife for mets to the brain that worked on the 9 originals, but two new ones have shown up so we are taking a look at those at the end of March. I have a CT on Monday with results on Wednesday for the lungs. Fingers crossed on those; they seem to still be growing slowly. I'll be keeping you in my thoughts and prayers. Aimee",

This may seem like ridiculous advice, but try to stay as busy as you can until you get your results back. Every time I get anxious I immediately turn my thoughts to my Christmas list and at least for a little while the anxiety goes away. It sounds like your doctors are being thorough, and that's a good thing. Will be hoping for the best news for you, Aimee",
