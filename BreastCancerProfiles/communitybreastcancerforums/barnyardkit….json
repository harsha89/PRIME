This was repeat of one done 3 days earlier. Told needed biopsy. Appointment already set for that Monday afternoon with my GP. He told me at 5:30pm to exspect a call the next day from Oncolagy. At 3:30 on Tuesday I'm being told needed Core ASAP. We were leaving next day for vacation and told her we'd be back Sunday by midnite. She said to have me in Out-patient by 7am Monday morning. Like she thought she could only barely reach outer edge of cluster for sample. Yesterday she called saying I will still have to have lumpectomy in 2nd week of Oct. and she will have to take muscle from armpit and lymps to get to the back wall. Need help in deciding should I go ahead and make it a total since I am already small chested. 34B HELP!",
