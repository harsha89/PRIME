      "Content": "frilly wrote: I have had a mamogram and ultra sound for a totally different pain in my breasts. My breasts were declare clear no problems. Last week, actually nine days ago I went to my GP because I have this terrible pain in my left breast almost into the armpit. I cannot feel any lumps at all but if I press down I can find a very painful \"spot\". The pain feels as if it is a burning almost tearing pain.. When I take my bra off and try to reach forwards or downwards the pain shoots out so badly it makes me shout out aloud. I have never felt any pain similar to this. It is situated where my breast meets my armpit, my bra causes pain when it touches it. I am conscious of it just there all the time especially when I am typing like now,. I have to support my breast when I take my bra off to have a shower and hold it close to my body. Any movement of my left arm causes this agonising pain in and down through my breast. Because I have fibromyalgia my GP said it is probably that but fibromyalgia has never caused  this type of pain. I can feel it slightly through into my back around the shoulder blade but so frightened of the pain I am not prepared to try looking there for it.  Has anyone any ideas PLEASE. I feel pretty desperate about this. Everyone else talks about lumps and periods I am 72 years young so that does not apply to me. Any ideas welcome. Thank you  Log in to post a reply",

He is convinced my breast is absolutely clear of any cancer because he has seen all the results from tests and they are clear. He also thinks now it is not fibro and has suggested a take celemite-B. It is a selium product which he says Breast Specialists put women with painful breasts on. It is difficult here (Australia) at this time of the year to see Specialists. It is school holiday  break (6 weeks). Hospital close theatres for repairs and maintenance and every-one that can takes holidays. It is awkward but the Drs are like us have families and want holidays with their children  It is not the time of the year to be ill. If you are very ill all attention needed is provided but just trying to see some-one for a reason like mine is difficult unless you are not concerned which Specialist you see. I have started this supplement, I am also taking Vit.E, Evening Primrose and very strong B Complex. That appears to be all possible at present.  I feel it is spreading but the intense pain happens as soon as I take my bra off and try to move my arm. I feel as if I am being stabbed by a burning sharp kn ife but from inside out. It makes me shout out, I have no control over that it just shocks me.. I will try this for a week maybe two and if no improvement I will ionsist onseeing a Specialist. Thank you again.",
