She had a Breast Patient Navigator who gave the best advice for everything. She suggested that my sister use a sink full of water with two large capfulls of Listerene in it and do a sponge bath. It was quite refreshing and because it has an aneseptic it was also good for sanitizing and keeping down bacteria. We were told absolutely not to shower until drains were out. 10 days post-op and all four drains were gone. God is Able!",
