Discouraged about the nodes, no evidence of disease prior to surgery. The waiting is the worst part of this whole journey. It has been very helpful to hear everyone's story and know that your're not the only one on this journey.",

Came as a surprise as no evidence of it before surgery. Still waiting on final path report from surgery to see how many positive.Have my first visit with the oncologist in a couple of weeks.  I had hoped the surgery would be enough but know chemo is ahead.  I too am scared but will deal with the next step as it comes up. Take care.",

Be patient, you'll feel better soon.  I am now 10days out of left MX with TE Every day was better than the last.  Tried to get out as soon as I felt well enough.  Got the last drain out yesterday (such a relief) and a fill on the TE.   Just feeling a little tightness. Looking forward to getting back to work which PS says can happen next week.  Wishing you all the best.",

Still waiting on results and nervous about what the next step will be.",
