I'm leaning heavily towards no reconstruction, at least not right now. I figure we can always reconstruct later. And while I'm not sure if it makes since to cut off a perfectly good breast, I'm wondering if a bilateral mastectomy might give me a more balance feeling. Then, even if I choose to reconstruct later, they can reconstruct them together. I would love to hear from your experiences. Thank you. 2 tumors in the same quadrant. 1 was Oncotype 13. 1 was Oncotype 20. 1 was 1.6cm. 1 was 1.9 cm.
