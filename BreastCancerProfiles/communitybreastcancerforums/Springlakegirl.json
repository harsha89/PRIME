They didn't edit hardly at all, and I'm no pro at being interviewed, but I feel pretty good about it overall. The woman who interviewed me has an amazing British accent, and I sound like a little girl on the air, I think, but oh well! ;) I guess that's why she is the host! The interview went so quickly, and she wanted me to share my story, and then a message at the end. I'm a little hesitant to share this. I don't think everyone on this board will like it, because I do like to offer hope for those battling stage 4 breast cancer. It's what I was looking for when I was diagnosed, and it's sooo hard to find. There are many more things I would have liked to share in this interview, but all of a sudden, it was just over! If I am ever interviewed again, I have learned from this experience. Anyway, if optimism is annoying to you right now, then don't listen to it, but if that's what you need, I hope it will give you a lift.  I go in for a follow-up PET scan Monday, and will get results Thursday, so hopefully I will be able to continue saying I am NED, or possibly \"cured\", but until I hear otherwise, I think sharing a positive story about MBC is what I want to do. I don't know all of you, but I truly feel like I love you and want the best for each of you!  This link goes to my online journal, which has the link to the podcast right on it. http://deniseneish.com/journal/ Log in to post a reply",

I am happy to report that I am currently doing very well. I ran 4 miles this morning, coached my son's junior high track team, played 4-square with my younger son, and snuggled and colored with my two girls. (My kids are 13, 7, 7, and 6). I recently had radiation to my one spot of known cancer in my right iliac. My life isn't perfect, and I wish I didn't have to deal with all the cancer crap, but I am happy and healthy overall. I am better able to just live my life without fretting as much as I did at the beginning of all this. These past 5 years have not been easy, but I have also been blessed with a lot of happiness along the way, and I feel very grateful for the many blessings in my wonderful life. I look forward to many healthy years ahead! Best wishes to all you brave women on this site! Log in to post a reply",

I am trying to adjust to a new way of thinking, and I wrote a post on it on my website. It is four pages long, so I will just put a link here:  http://deniseneish.com/journal/ Basically, I am going forward treating my cancer more as \"chronic\" than terminal, which I know is something many of you do. Although, I must still maintain hope of being cured one day, when the treatment and the time is right. That idea is just helpful for me.  I would love to hear wisdom from any of you on how you view your cancer. Do you feel it is worth risking quality of life for a more intense \"curative\" approach, or have you moved beyond that, feeling more acceptance of continuously treating cancer throughout your life? And is it helpful for you to hope for a cure one day for yourself, or do you just look it in the eye and face it with as much courage as you can?  I know not everyone is in the same place with treatment, and how much spread you have, etc., so I hope this is not an offensive question for anyone. I just am curious as to how everyone deals with it mentally? I liked my pep talk from Dr. Valero. Maybe it will be helpful for some of you too, so that is why I shared my experience from this last week. Log in to post a reply",

I was very surprised, because, while I meet most of the requirements to receive this drug, I have had endocrine therapy, and so I assumed I would get denied by insurance, even though my oncologist recommended it for me. I was looking into alternative routes to get access to Ibrance (Palbociclib), but we ran it through insurance first. I think my oncologist did a good job of making the case that it was the right drug for me, and I got approved! I am really happy about this, and wanted to share with any of you who are hoping to get on this drug. I also heard from a friend in Michigan who has MBC who was also approved. She similarly did not know if she would qualify. I don't know what insurance she has, but I think this is promising news. My hospital doesn't have the drug in stock yet, but I should be able to get on it fairly soon. Any other successes with getting insurance approval for Palbociclib out there? Log in to post a reply",
