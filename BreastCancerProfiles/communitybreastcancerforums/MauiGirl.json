It got quite a bit better during 3rd post-op week. Gets worse again after having my expanders filled, but gets better then after a couple of days. PS \"assures\" me that it will go away, but he say's 6-12 months!  While I don't really want to take neurontin, I may have no choice--I certainly can't go topless at work! I go back to work (also as an NP) in 2 weeks, so I'm trying to stay off the narcs as much as I can.  Can't take Ibuprofen (get gastritis), and acetamenophen is like eating candy.  If you can take 6 weeks off, I'd recommend it.  I'm at 4-1/2 weeks postop now, and really would not feel like going back to work tomorrow. I'm also anxious to hear what others can recommend--this is by far worse than surgical pain!",

PS was able to expand TE's with 240 cc each.  Was really concerned about post-op nausea, but the anesthesiologist was an angel and gave me medications to hit every nausea receptor she could hit--transderm scopolamine, decadron, benadryl, zofran, propofol, and something else that I don't remember.  Worked like a charm! Post op pain has been manageable with vicodin, and have only had to take it at bedtime the past couple of nights.  Muscle spasms are a different matter, though, and have been taking valium on schedule every 8 hours for those.  If I roll over even slightly onto my side, my sternum feels like it's going to split in two! I was totally unprepared for the amount of fatigue that I've felt--just getting up to the bathroom and walking around the house for a few minutes every hour has worn me out. Taking a shower this morning was the extent of my activity for the day! Go back to the PS on Friday.  Would love to get rid of the drains, but they're both still putting out way too much for that (about 100 cc/day). Feel very fortunate and greatful that I'm feeling as well as I do!  Can't wait until I can sleep in my bed--getting really tired of this darn recliner!",
