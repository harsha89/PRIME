But you are saying you had chemo at the start. In our case, they have started with tamox and zometa. I just keep thinking maybe this cancer needs a big kick. But, I'm afraid it can just kill mom faster. She never had chemo before. How can I make her stronger for chemo? She can't move much due to fractured hip.",

She had leg pain for months, but doctors believed it's a result of years old fall, then that it's arthritis. She always had some joint pain, especially at the change of the weather. She never took chemo before, never had cancer before. She had a benign breast lump when she was young that was operated out. The doctors are now saying, it should not have been done at all. I don't know whether to beg for more aggressive treatment or rely on tamoxifen and zometa and God to help. I just weep when I see her in morphine-induced sleep, when I see her ulcers. I'm just afraid that if tamoxifen will not influence anything in a few months, they will refuse to do anything at all. If they believe she's too weak for chemo now, what will be later. Thank you, Annie I can see that you have a similar dx and receive a similar treatment. I am sending healing thoughts to you for thinking of others.",
