Like you, I was in a stunned haze when diagnosed, and I have finished chemo and radiation treatments and am taking Herceptin infusions until April (one year anniversary). I took one step at a time with the help of my breast surgeon and the oncologist. Advice: accept the help of family and friends. They so want to help. I found I needed the most help after the situation was old news. Spending a pleasant lunch with someone was a wonderful gift. I wasn't particularly religious, but someone knitted me a prayer shawl, and that touched me deeply. Several friends added me to prayer lists. I only told strangers and acquaintances about my situation when I felt moved to, and accepted kindnesses from thecaring community of people waiting for treatment at the chemo lab. That's a fantastic idea about having someone to take notes, because it's hard to absorb everything. Living Proof is an inspiring movie about the targeted therapy for HER2 positive cancer. I had the most energy in the mornings and tried to do something I liked every day. Xanax settled me on chemo days and I took Ambien to sleep. I have almost always felt healthy, so even being tired and sleepy was new. And finally, a lumpectomy wasn't bad, and although I was fatigued from taking external breast radiation, it's not painful and it's something positive you can embrace in your treatment. I am humbled by the kindness of others, amazed at effective new treatments, and encouraged by chances of success. This isn't a journey I would have chosen, but I hope all of you find some positive value to your situation.",
