All of this is remarkable.  Right now I feel like I am running in circles.  This \"thing\" is a business all of it's own.",

Boy I never would have imagined all of the same issues i have been experiencing. And YES I agree, the pre-op preparatory reading was bad enough - and NO it did not include the nightmarish PMPS. I was just coming out here to see if I could find assistance in how to manage it. I have asked my PS whose care I am still under..... have a quarter sized area still trying to heal... I complain of the pain, the stinging shooting, burning pains, and the annoying itching (all more on one side than the other), and all i get is the repeated \"yes you are still restricted from duties, reaching.....\", and the pain is normal. An occasional cold water bottle feels great(of course not too cold cause they don't want you to over do it with the cold or heat.) I was at the vitamin store this week and noticed \"NerveFix\", a homeopathic treatment for nerve pain.... really trying not to get into any new meds like neurontin... Just started the NerveFix... dont know if its too soon to tell yet. I have been wondering how long this is supposed to persist.... guess i got my answer in reading a lot of your testimonials.",

Will stand down on \"self treating\"..... would not want to interfere with natural healing process. The burning pain is ruling my life & totally adds to the depression of all \"this\"...... I will be reaching out to my PS office via email to inquire on the continued pain & suggested ways to deal with it until I see him again. Again, thanks for the feedback. Totally expected to get my hands slapped on self treating.... any & all feedback is appreciated.",
