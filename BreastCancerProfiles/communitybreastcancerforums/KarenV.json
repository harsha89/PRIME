Cells have returned abnormal. My Aunty from my dad's side had breast cancer at the age of 45. My specialist said that 7 times out of 10 if they remove the lump it will be benign. He wants to keep an eye on it. I started getting severe pain 1 week after the biopsy and the pain radiated from my nipple to under my armpit. I felt like I was having a let-down and bruised. The breast was swollen and hard. I just returned from an appointment with my specialist and he conducted another ultra-sound. He said that the lump he drained has returned and suggested another biopsy but said return in 6 months to do this....? The pain in my breast is continual and I am not sure that I am 100% confident with my surgeons advice. Has anyone else experienced this? thank you Log in to post a reply",

The GP sent me off for an urgent ultra sound last week due to swelling and pain - the surgeon told me that my breast tissue is dense which can mean i am more prone to cancer. He keeps saying that abnormal cells were found but imaging does not indicate a concern. I have only had the cyst drained not removed and it has returned already (within 6 weeks)....  Thank you to everyone for your feedback and advice, it is very much appreciated. ",
