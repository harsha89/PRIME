Just a thought on totally flat and removing fat: comfort! I had double masts with 3rd level LN dissect. All the fat on my chest and axilla were removed. It was necessary to close my chest and remove as much disease as possible. There is no padding between skin and bone and I must say, is uncomfortable and sensitive even after almost 9 years. Having a nice even layer of fat over your ribs will keep you comfortable. Sherri ",

Very web-like. Negative tumor markers all though the years. Labs and more recent spread to the skin on my upper back and stomach are the only ways to monitor this very insidious and persistent cancer. Earlier this year I was 2-3 months from death from liver infiltration. Imaging did not show tumor. After ever liver test known, I had a trans-jugular biopsy which proved extensive disease. Id exhausted every hormonal therapy so though it was curtains for me. My doc tried an old oral chemo and it\u2019s been a miracle! Liver function back to normal, skin tumors gone, peritoneal cancer causing much less pain than in past years. I\u2019m still here 8 years on! I\u2019m not the same person as I was. Cancer has been very aging for me, but I\u2019m ALIVE! And ok with looking old. I\u2019m thankful for every day I have. The little things give me pleasure now, the warm sun on my face, chilly autumn nights, a cuddle with my dog Frankie birds singing in my yard, a delicious meal, talking with my son.......",

I\u2019ve been without breasts for 8 years and have found most mastectomy bras and inserts to be quite uncomfortable. I can\u2019t wait to take them off each day. Even the soft and light sports bras for non mastectomy women are uncomfortable. I\u2019ve been \u201cmaking do\u201d for a long time as many of us do. I\u2019ll take some time to really think about how I would like my mastectomy bras and inserts to feeland function. Talk to you soon, Sherri ",

Can say there are many reasons for breast pain and a lump or lumpiness. A clogged duct, infection,broken blood vessel, an area of the breast with more breast tissue and therefore more sensitive to hormones and much more. I knew since childhood my grandmother, her sisters, their cousins and my mother had breast cancer. It didn\u2019t help very much, really. Anxiety! yes! I don\u2019t tend to be an anxious person and have always hit crisis straight on, but my diagnosis threw me for a loop. I had to take some Ativan for awhile at first. Don\u2019t hesitate to ask for what you need from your docs. They are there to care of all of you. Please let us know how you are doing if you feel like it.",

If docs are throwing up their hands, get another opinion. NOW. Find the best cancer center you can reasonably get to, even if it means driving farther than you\u2019d like. I live in a small town with a small town cancer center. Docs were throwing up their hands when I was diagnosed. The spread was so extensive on my chest and presumably lymph nodes they were flummoxed. They knew it had already spread. I got a second opinion at a well respected cancer institute 100 miles from my home. I truly believe I\u2019d have long since died had I stayed in my hometown to be treated. I\u2019ve had several scares, most recently earlier this year. I have ILC with a particularly invisible growth pattern that does not show on imaging, other than in bone. My labs were showing that my liver would soon fail or I would bleed to death as my platelet count became very low. My liver looked fine on CT & MRI. Biopsy confirmed extensive infiltration of ILC. I had lost a lot of weight. I am 5\u20196\u201d and weighed 110#. I\u2019ve used up all of the hormonal and targeted therapies. During this period I additionally began sprouting skin tumors on my shoulders and back at the rate of 1-2 per week. I thought it was the end. My doc prescribed Xeloda, oral chemo, in May. It\u2019s really a newer generation of an old chemotherapy drug. After taking this drug for only about 2 weeks my skin tumors began shrinking rapidly. My liver enzymes began falling. I\u2019d has cancer related (or so they thought) anemia for about 2 years. I no longer have anemia, I weigh 126# (gained 16#), my liver enzymes have returned to normal. Xeloda may not be the right drug for your breast cancer, however I\u2019m telling you these things to let you know that there is hope. My end of the road is not yet here, although a few months ago it appeared so. Get the best treatment you can. This is your life. There\u2019s no time for doctors feelings (yes, docs down here were calling the doctors at the cancer institute where I am seen, angry because I went to them). They tried to guilt me into staying put. I knew finding the best treatment possible was my only hope of extending my life for more than about 2 years. 8 years later I\u2019m feeling less burdened by cancer than I\u2019ve felt in a long time. And, driving is not so bad for such an important cause if you have a good cancer institute where you could be seen. Let loved ones shuttle you about. Sit back and enjoy the scenery and sip you favorite drink. You deserve it. I\u2019m sorry you have to face this terrible disease. It\u2019s frightening and confusing. I\u2019ll be thinking of you and wishing you the best for a substantial and long lasting reprieve. Fight,Fight,Fight! ",
