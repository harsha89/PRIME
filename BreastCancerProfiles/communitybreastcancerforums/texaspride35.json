I was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma on May 15 and I'm scared as hell...I'm a army veteran and I get all my medical care (when needed and hasn't been need often, until now) though our local VA here in Houston...Although it hasn't been that long since my diagnosis, I'm nervous and the waiting is getting to me... My Primary Care at the VA is waiting for addition test results to return and then, she will forward them to the referral oncologist...Just like the military, hurry up and wait :( I've always had my yearly mammogram (I'm 53) and was constantly doing the self-examinations and I never and I mean NEVER felt anything...I guess it's why I'm in such shock...As of right now, I don't know the extent of this damn disease (I don't know what stage it's in, if it spreading/growing or nothing)...Does this type of cancer grows and or spread rapidly? I'm at my wits end!!!! Arggggggghhhh So if you don't mind, please help put my mind at ease the best of your ability because I'm about ready to lose it...Oh, I don't have great family/friends support but unfortunately, it's still hard on me because of the not knowing... So in closing if anyone that has BC and got your care through the VA, would you please share your experiences as far was the wait time to get things rolling and thank you all...I'm happy to answer any questions that you might have for me... BTW and I hope I don't gross anyone out but, I've never shitted so much in my life and I hope it's all due to my nervousness... LOL Thank you Log in to post a reply",
