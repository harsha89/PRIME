After I made my decision on July 15th I found out my BS and PS are on vacation Aug. 1-15. The waiting is horrible but now I will be able to move our triplet girls back to college for their sophomore year. Have to keep finding the blessings in this terrible journey. Will look forward to keeping up with you ladies. This site has been very helpful so far. Susan",

Have any of you with BMX and TE's come home without a compression garment? My PS told me today that he doesn't want me to wear anything but gauze and loose fitting tops. Plus absolutely NO shower until all the drains come out and I may have 5!!! I did buy the wedge pillow but may have my DH bring the recliner up from the basement and put in our room. Sounds like you are all 50/50 right now for which works best. I am still on for Monday so hope to post a few days after. Take care, Susan",

I couldn't get on the computer to see all of your posts though, so I missed a bunch! Welcome to you newbies and I hope surgery went well for all of you this week so far. I am still plowing through my very long To-Do list. Have to take our triplets back to college this weekend so lots of shopping and packing yet to do. I don't know the specifics about my tumor. It made me nervous at first but I decided to have a BMX anyway. My BS says that all the typing and hormone issues are \"second tier\" information and that I will know all of that with final path report. I haven't met with a MO either...again they said it depends on final path. So many of you know all about this before your surgery or have even had chemo already. Â The other issue I want to do more research on is the SNB. When I asked at the BS office they said \"he takes the one and then takes more if they look bad\". Well I don't know that taking them based on looks is a good idea? Sounds like more women are having less invasive node surgery and getting same results. I am totally freaked out about getting LE. And I did have an MRI and it didn't show any node issues on that. Well a little less than two weeks now to figure it all out. Pre-op physical is this Friday. Hugs and prayers to everyone, Susan",

I have never had mono but my girls have and it must feel like this. I get out of bed for 5 minutes and it feels like I have sprinted five miles. Can't wait for this SE to go away. Sherry - I had TC on Thursday but before my nurse started the Cytoxan she asked me if I was prone to sinus problems. I told her YES. She said Cytoxan can give you wicked sinus problems if not given very, very slowly. She said as soon as I felt pressure to tell her. About one-third of the way I did. She slowed it down even more. I think it took 2.5 hours and usually takes 1. I was not in any hurry if it meant I wouldn't have the sinus issues. I have been able to use extra strength Tylenol for the remaining headache. I sure hope you feel better soon! Hope everyone has a good week. Susan",

My final TC was today. I am praying I sleep this weekend so I can function next week. We leave for family Christmas trip to Hawaii. Best to all of you, Susan",

Carla......I did have my port removed at my swap surgery two weeks ago. On one hand I thought it was a good sign but the worrier in me felt like I was jinxing something. It really was in an awkward place so it does feel good to have it out. Have a good weekend.....we are finally getting snow, it has been a strange winter. Susan",

My lashes and brows are slowly falling out now. I had a LE scare right before Christmas. I saw an OT and wore a sleeve. I checked back in with my PT and she found a lot of adhesions under my left arm and TE. She thinks it is localized edema rather than LE. It hurts like heck but she has been trying to break up the adhesions before my swap surgery next Tues. My measurements in my left arm have gone back to normal so hopefully we are on the right track. My BS was shocked I would have LE with one node but I know it does happen. Glad most of you are finishing up chemo soon. Every hurdle feels great to clear, Susan",

Finally feeling back to normal and thank goodness because I have a super busy week ahead of me. Our four girls will all be home next weekend and I CANNOT wait!
