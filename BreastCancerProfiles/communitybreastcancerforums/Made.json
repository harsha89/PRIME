Did I stay in this positive mode - heck no - cried in the shower several times and then 4 or 5 months post treatment - cried to Craig Morgan's song Tough more times than I want to admit.  Figure out that for me -while in the mode of deciding treatment and getting the news out was a safe time.  It was that down time after that was dangerous.  However, I'm 10 months post diagnosis and doing great.  How you deal with this is totally up to you and there is no wrong way - just your way!!

Keep in mind what you are reading here is antidotal and those with no side effects from it probably don't even post. I had 3 nodes removed after receiving an injection of something that allowed the nuclear machine to mark my SNBs. My Breast Surgeon didn't even need a 2nd incision to remove. I've had absolutely no side effects from the SNB. I do treat my right arm (right breast - idc and dcis) as a breast cancer arm and don't allow blood draws or blood pressure readings but other than that it works just as hard as my left. I am almost 3 months post op.",
