I do see a cardiologist annually and like you I seem to get slightly winded by the time I reach the top of a few flights of stairs. I do exercise but not as much as when I was told of my blockages. We moved back to our home state and my work schedule is making it hard for me to get back into an exercise routine as I had before. It is nice meeting someone who has been through the same bumps in the road of life. I was expecting the breast cancer diagnosis for the past 20 years. My oncologist would always tell me to be sure and keep up with my mammograms due to the increased risk, which I did. I guess that's why I wasn't that shocked when I was diagnosed, was always expecting it every year. Take care and carry on!  ",

My mind was made up before my first visit with my breast surgeon. I knew a double mastectomy was my only option, and I chose no reconstruction. I decided to go flat and free üòÅ. My breast surgeon was somewhat shocked and gave me a week to be sure and talk it over with my husband some more. My decision stood and I have no regrets. I don't have any dizziness however, don't know if you are experiencing this. It seems like my throat may be scarred from the radiation? Seems like food has a tendency to get stuck? Never had an issue with this until recently, always sure to have water nearby and small bites. Also when you were diagnosed with BC, were you a little apprehensive when you were told you needed no further treatment? I was somewhat shocked when my surgeon told me to go home and get on with my life, no further treatment needed, see you in six months. I felt like I should be doing more. Take care.",

Treated with 8 rounds of chemo (abvd) and 1 month upper mantle radiation. Was told the same as a lot of you, \"you'll be fine, you have the good cancer\". Well, I guess I did, I went 17 years, saw my three young boys grow up and become young men. Like you, I also feel like that textbook case, I had quadruple bypass surgery in 2013, and recently diagnosed with DCIS and had a double mastectomy, all due to prior treatment for the Hodgkins. Living life to the fullest and will not let these side effects take control of me and my life. Summer runs, winter walks and time flies...",

My thyroid was totally destroyed about a year out from radiation, have been on synthroid since. I agree with you as to paying attention to our bodies and keeping up with annual appointments, as much as I dislike going! Honestly believe it has saved my life, especially with the CABG. I am grateful for the life I have been given and know that mine has not been bad at all and that so many people have been through much worse. I will talk to my dentist at my next visit. April",
