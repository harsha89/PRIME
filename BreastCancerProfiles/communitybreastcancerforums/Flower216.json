They also have a gel pencil that looks great, but it was a little to hard for me to get the hang of it. I didn't want false lashes, but always put on eyeliner that made my eyes look more normal.

I just was folding laundry and complaining about missing socks. I have a bag of \"singles\" and don't know where their partners are!! Also I did take the Claritan (they kept me on it for 10 days) and still got back spasms..OUCH! But the Neulasta did keep my blood count high that I got the okay to go to Zumba classes (cant do anything in the gym-its too germy). Nanette..You talk about learning abbreviations-think of the education we got the last couple of months (one which we would rather not have). We learned vocabulary, about the body and lots of different meds and their side effects! anxiouslady\u2026 my next treatment is also 12/26 ...I am every three weeks but with xmas it will be 3 1/2 weeks this time. At least this round we know more of what we are getting into. Christine...Hope you are having an easy day today!! Remember if you want to sleep all day do it...give into what your body needs/wants. Becky....92 pounds!!! That's impressive! I follow WW but I have been eating so many carbs recently that I put on a few pounds. I need to watch myself before it gets out of control! Marnie...the steroids gave me hiccups for 2 1/2 hrs non stop on the first night. Dr is cutting dosage for next treatment So my hair starting falling out Thursday, on Friday I cut it very short, and now its falling out in clumps. What surprised me is the scalp pain...I expected tingling but not pain. Every day of this journey is something new!! Be Well everyone!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ",

One thing I didn't think of, is how cold the back of my neck gets (I'm in NJ). I don't know how men do it. I either wear a shirt with a collar or I have to wear a scarf! And yes, I agree, a sense of humor is very important. Angie-good for you for trying the cold capping. I read about it, but just didn't have the energy to try it. I don't regret my decision now, since its winter its easy to through a hat on, but I wonder if I will feel different in the spring. Oh well...too late now! So I had my second treatment on Wednesday. First I met with my doctor, he answered some questions I had and then he said that I since I didn't have an allergic reaction the first time, I should be fine this time. Well...less than 5 minutes after the IV drip started, my stomach began to hurt, I turned bright red, and almost passed out. It was scary!  When I opened my eyes, there was a team of nurses and my doctor around me. So now for round three-in January- I will get Abraxane (which is in the same class as Taxotere) and Cytoxan. Has anyone had Abraxane, and if so, how did you do with it? Dr did say its very expensive, so I am hoping that insurance will okay it. Every day of this trip is a new adventure!!!!!! ",

But dr did say it is a cumulative effect. Tiredness/exhaustion will be the toughest on this fourth round. I feel like I finally have my strength back...at least I have the weekend to enjoy it!! Ironically it was 3 degrees in NJ the other day...on Tuesday it will be almost 60 degrees! (perhaps I should skip threatment and go for a walk on the beach)!",

Right before my lumpectomy, I told the nurse I needed the bathroom. She walked with me there and I said, \"maybe I don't want to do this-I think I just want to leave\". She stopped short-turned to me-and said \"I cannot stop you from leaving But your family will be really angry if you don't have this surgery for your future\". Then she gave me a hug!!! Anxious..congrats on your last chemo!! Today was 7/33 of my rads treatment. I told the RO that I finally feel like I am getting my pre-chemo energy back. His response was that's great, but in another week or two the radiation exhaustion will hit! UGH! That's all I can say!!

I went to Sophera and bought \"Benefit  Foolproof Brow Powder\". They showed me how to use it (practiced it a couple of times-but so easy) and I now don't leave the house without it. I actuall feel human again! Just today I see a few lashes and brows starting to come in!!! MC...You have a great attitude towards your workouts!! I do find when I go to Zumba (my addiction) it does wonders for my mental state! Nanette...sorry about your aches and pains.

You are one of the cheerleaders of our group and as you said, \"Fighting cancer is not easy. But we can do this!\" Becky....congrats for finishing radiation!!!!!!!!! I have 12 more treatments, but there is an end in sight!! My head is also fuzz-it looks like it may be salt and pepper! Today I noticed a few eyelashes/brows starting to come through!!!

But I did overdose with the Aveeno, partly because it felt cool and soothing. I only had minor discoloration with the boosts, nothing painful. Everyone\"s skin reacts differently, but for me, applying the cream 3-4 times daily did work well. Good luck with your treatments...the few weeks will fly by!!",

So earlier this week I sent them an email asking when the January  classes will be posted. I woman wrote back, a friendly but disappointing reply!!!  She said,   \"Thank you for your email, which comes during a very busy time of transition for the Look Good Feel Better (LGFB) program.  One of our program collaborators is leaving the program at the end of 2018, and we are busy restructuring and rolling out an updated program platform for 2019.  What this entails is basically on-boarding hospital workshop locations one at a time, and unfortunately, there are no group LGFB workshops being offered until around March of 2019.  I am truly sorry for this inconvenience.\" She also said that in the meantime we can register for a online virtual LGFB workshop. I'm sure this workshop is wonderful...but its not the same. Sorry...I don't mean to complain..but I was disappointed!!  ",
