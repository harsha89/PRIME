I try to buy clothes that have necklines and patterns that minimize the visual effect. BS is not an option for me. I'm dealing with active cancer. I look at the problem being half flat as a minor issue. Some folks are dealing with missing arms or legs, and they cope - so can we. If anyone is noticing that things are not matching up, they're not sharing that with me. The important thing is that your cancer is being handled.",
