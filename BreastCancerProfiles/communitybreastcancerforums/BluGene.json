It was a long day, but \u201call is well that ends well.\u201d The biggest glitch to the day is the mammo machine broke right before I was to get the wire inserted. I waited over an hour in the hallway outside the room, then they finally said they were confident they could do it with US. So that is what happened. The wire was supposed to be easy, but it took 45 mins. My breast tissue is very tough, they said. We tried different positions so he could get some \u201coomph\u201d behind it. By that time. The freezing was fine and I felt EVERYTHING. It hurt so, so much, but I knew I couldn\u2019t move and I didn\u2019t want to stop it because every mm was a milestone. So I breathed through the pain (went back to my times in labour), and they got it done. I was so relieved. Because of all of that, my surgery got pushed back a few hours. I asked for pain meds and I slept on and off until the time. The surgery itself was fine. I haven\u2019t heard any feedback from anyone yet, but I\u2019m at home. Should have path results within the week. I\u2019ve taken the week off work, which maybe have been excessive, but I\u2019m quite sore today, especially under my arm, and my throat still hurts to swallow. All in all, I\u2019m still in good spirits. My main goal is to stay positive, because I think healing will go hand in hand with that. I\u2019m not sure when I\u2019m ok to take the bandage off...have any off you had a partial mx or lumpectomy and have instructions for after care? Thanks everyone.  Looks like HockeyChick is next.

The last one I had scanned came back benign and it went away within a month or two. I wasn\u2019t even worried about it, because it felt just like benign lumps are described. This lump I have now is more concerning not only because it feels different and is in the same area where my last mammogram identified my micro calcs as clustering, but because it feels Ike it is growing outwards...if that makes sense. Like given enough pressure, it would bulge through my skin.

You can see every scar I've ever had, and I have stretch marks from my armpits to my calves that are very prominent. I peel, rash, and bruise easy. So that makes me think I'll have to be extremely routine and careful with my skin. Yikes. I know my grandma had radiation on her breast, and my mom told me her entire breast was \u201cblack.\" That was 30 years ago, though! How are you feeling one year out?  Josie Thank you! I sure hope there are no surprises when they open me up. Were you prepared for that news? What does long term hormone treatment look like for you? If I only have DCIS, will they test those hormones out (I have to study up on those too, it appears). That gene I have has recently been related to triple negative cancer. So I'm curious if that comes into play at all. You say daily radiation gave you more energy? I would never have guessed that! Did you continue your normal days while dong so? Will I be able to work at the same time? Yes, I'll be asking these questions to my surgeon, but they are popping in my head as I type. :) Thank you so much for all the advice!  Zoisite Funny you should ask that question because that's the first thing I said when my surgeon told me. She said she felt like it would be peace of mind getting it taken out while being on a waitlist. But now that you bring up how the rads can affect it, I'm going to take that into consideration. Especially, as I said above, I'm not a very good \u201chealer\". Did you have to get a lot of radiation? I also expressed my concerns about being under anaesthesia multiple times and under the knife etc. That's my only fear, being chopped up over and over and in a healing, cutting, healing circle. Because it appears to be so early on (I had a mammo 15 months ago and no note of my microcalcifications changing at that time), perhaps I can just wait for dmx. I'm a patient person, and I think my peace of mind will be fine just knowing it will all be taken care of at once. I have to decide by Thursday to cancel the lumpectomy or not. So I must start studying! Thank you all for the birthday wishes and support.",

Mostly relating to ovarian cancer, but there are many studies relating to BC, including triple negative (grandma had that no one at 49) I had a hysterectomy 7 years ago. Only ovaries are left for now. I have had mammos for the last 3 years. First one showed many micro calcs in Rt breast. Second one 6mo later found lump, got US and told benign. Third one -a year ago- there was mention of increased density in rt breast, but I also lost a lot of weight (by trying!), so that was noted as possibly why. Fourth one was a month ago. Density increased. Micro calcs are now changing and clustering. The technician also found a lump as she was placing my breast on machine. She asked if I knew about it, but I hadn't been doing self exams, and I wash with a mesh ball in the shower. I should have felt it. It is very noticeable even with just a gentle swipe across the middle outter side of my rt breast. Felt like a pebble. Nothing like lump from before. Since then it has slightly grown with the lumpy tissue around it bulging more too, also slightly, but I feel them more Scan showed it's in same area as clustering micro calcs. Referred for stereotactic biopsy on the micros and ultrasound on lump. Had US a few days ago. She noted I was very lumpy, and got my results yesterday. It is assumed a cyst. Went to my doctor yesterday for the results and he was very surprised they didn't want more follow up other than what mammo referred to. He felt my lump and immediately said, \"yeah that needs to be taken out right away.\" He called the surgeon while I was sitting there and didn't hold back on his concerns. I'll be having it fully removed and tested within a week or two he said. I'm very optimistic in nature, and even this, because I've been so proactive, isn't even scaring me terribly. What I'm on here for is curiosity. Do lumps that show as cysts on US sometimes come back from testing with results other than benign? Also, what types of questions do I need to start asking? I obviously know I have a higher/increased chance of BC based on family history alone, but coupled with a cancer gene and clustering/changing micros, even more so. I'm not scared. But I do feel very differently about my breast. Even before the last mammogram. I used to like it being touched and in the last six months, it is irritable and uncomfortable, and I just feel \"icky\" when my husband goes there. (Yes he knows now and doesn't anymore). Anyone relate to this situation? I have a great doctor, I just need to know what information I should gather. Even so that my daughter has it for her future. Most of our family members who had it have passed away from it. My aunt is a survivor (twice). Oh and there is also conversation about mastectomy. I'm leaving that one until necessary but it is officially on the table.
