    "Content": "SecretlyDistressed wrote: I was recently diagnosed with 3 different types of breast cancer. 2 very aggressive. Triple Negative included of course. However, it most likely has not metastasized yet. I will get a PET scan Thursday. The medical oncologist wanted to start heavy duty chemo in 2 weeks or less. So I\u2019m scheduled to start in just over a week. I don\u2019t have a good support system, so I will be dealing with the side effects all alone. I don\u2019t think I can get thru it. I just don\u2019t. So I feel since there\u2019s likely no metastasis, why should I suffer thru chemo unnecessarily?
