Could feel quite a large lump, went to docs had anti biotics, they referred me to breast specslist who did ultrasound thought it may be cyst or absess.. Said they couldn't see nothing no absess or cyst, but could feel lump? Had two biospys now as my first biopsy got lost apprently, I'm so stressed out, in agony constantly and so nervous for my results! Has anyone got any ideas what this could be? I'm normally a 34b in bras, my right boob is currently fitting in to double d cup from swelling! Log in to post a reply",
