The locations of your metastases are sites that suggest it may be lobular carcinoma, and I seem to recall reading that ILC responds better to femara (letrozole) than other antihormonals.  Hope someone jumps in and corrects me if I'm wrong. Wishing you every success in your treatment!   ",

March 8th.)  We have outside animals and it has been a real struggle keeping water tanks free from ice for our two horses and the group of milk goats, ...and hauling warm water to the chickens and buck.  So far they are doing well, and we haven't lost any of them... even the little two pound silkies (miniature chickens).   Knock on wood!  Hang in there... Spring is on its way...I hope.",

They certainly hold their own in a flock of much larger birds, but yet are docile enough to sit on your lap to be petted. ",
