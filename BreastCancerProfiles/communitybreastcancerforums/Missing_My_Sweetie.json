    "Content": "Missing_My_Sweetie wrote: Hello All, I'm Brian. Never posted on the site here before, but have read a bit in the past. Anyway, my sweet wifey battled Stage IV breast cancer for 3 years and passed away a month and a half ago on her 34th birthday. I sure do miss her! Anyway, I was just going through emails that she had sent and found one that she sent to the O'Keeffe's company. She emailed them telling them how great their \"Working Hands\" hand cream had worked for her. The chemo really took its toll on her hands and feet. One day she bought this stuff at Lowe's and it worked great to help her skin heal up. I figured there were a few of you who probably deal with the same thing, so I had to post this. If any of you are dealing with cracking fingers and feet, maybe get ahold of this stuff and try it. It worked pretty darn good for my sweetie. I wish all of you dealing with this crappy cancer luck. My wife sent this email to the O'Keeffe's company last year. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I have been undergoing Cancer treatments for a little over two years now for Breast Cancer.  With the medication I take it makes my fingers and feet crack and bleed this has been an ongoing problem at some points it is so bad that I am scared to pick things up or buckle my seat belt because my fingers hurt so bad.  I have also had to get a handicap sicker mainly due to the fact my feet hurt so bad I cannot walk. Well Less than a week ago last Friday my husband and I went to Lowe's to get some stuff and I was wishing I had not gone my feet were hurting very bad.  Well as we were standing there paying for our other items I seen Working Hands and purchased it.  I would like to say this is the best stuff ever.  Talk about life changing for me it has been my fingers and feet are almost healed this is something I will deal with forever due to the Chemo drugs so it is nice to know that I have finally found something that works.  I have a closet of lotions that people have given me some smell good and others very bad but O'Keeffe's is hands down the best and no smell. I wish everyone that has Cancer was given information about this stuff as much as you deal with during treatments it is nice to have relief in something.  I certainly will be telling everyone I can.     By the way I am only 33 years old I am sure the feet and fingers are much worse for older people dealing with treatment. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Brian Log in to post a reply",
