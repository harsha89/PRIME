I was very scared of having radiation treatment, but I can honestly say that for me APBI was not painful and so far (keeping my fingers crossed), the side effects have been quite minimal.  I had to push to get APBI because as a radiation treatment, it only has 5 years of comparative data in the US (longer in Europe and Canada).  Get an opinion (or two) as to whether your particular case is suitable for APBI instead of whole breast irradiation.  ",
