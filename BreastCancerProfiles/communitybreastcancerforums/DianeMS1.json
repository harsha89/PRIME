And with no family or friend experiences, it was hard for me to talk about it with them. Their advice was well-meaning, but not really helpful. This web site helped me immensely. I just had my 6 mo. mammogram on the bad side, and there is something suspicious about it. The radiologist recommends coming back in 5 months, and I have to wait until the 9th to see my doctor to even find out what the problem is. The anxiety you feel is really something I really identify with. I took ativan the first couple months after diagnosis, and now I feel like taking it again. Even tho my Oncotype score was 4, I think the fear and anxiety stay with us. I've been on tamoxifen for 4 mos. now, and the SE are manageable. But like you, I'm near sighted and already have baby cataracts, so I'm afraid of losing more sight. I just thought I should at least give the meds a try, and I could make a decision any time along the way to discontinue. Problem is, my MO wants me to take it for only 2 years, then switch to AI drugs. Since I too have osteopenia, I told him I would have to think long and hard about that decision. I even agree with you about feeling guilty when other women are in a worse spot than me. But each of us has our own journey to make, and everyone's struggle is a little different. Thanks for sharing, I really identified with your remarks.",

I think the fear stays with us of a possible recurrence, but you won't always feel so anxious. I just went to my family dr. and asked her to read the mammo report. She said the things the radiologist is seeing are normal after a lumpectomy and internal radiation scarring, and I too have very dense breasts, so they are hard to read. She said the 5 month re-check is protocol. So that was a big relief. My internal radiation started two weeks after my surgery, so my experience from screening mammo to completion of my radiation was two months total. It must be really hard for you to have it go on so long. Still, I feel like I didn't quite have enough time to process everything that was happening, and I think going to your support group will really help with that. Keep the faith that it will all work out for you!",

In retrospect, I would have done the 30 days of external if I knew then what I know now. I know not everyone has a bad experience, but in talking with my nurse navigator, she feels that patients like me who have it inserted from the side and spanning the entire breast to the other side have had a much harder time. I still have a fair amount of discomfort in the tumor area, and I blame the internal radiation. It's a choice for everyone to make. I just wish they had been more up front about what could happen. And PS, nothing for pain for me either when it was removed. I took a pain pill before, but still screamed when it was removed. Luckily, it comes out fast.",

Dr would only say take 4 advil and let the tech know how painful I still was. I did, and she did a great job, really fast in and out to lessen the discomfort. It was uncomfortable, but not all that painful. I expected it would be sore for a while after, but it was not. Phew!",
