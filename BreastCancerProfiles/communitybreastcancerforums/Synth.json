For years doctors told their patients that if a woman had fibrous breast desease that it was highly unlikely that she would ever develope breast cancer. My doctor actually told me I was lucky because I would most certainly never have breast cancer. But things change , progress, evolve, now they know better. The first time I was diagnosed I was 23 and they removed a third of my right breast because of multiple calcifications. It was benign. I would undergo several more biopsies until finally about five years in to being mammogramed and then again biopsied I stopped going when the Cancer Center called. I would not return for almost twenty years, this time it was malignant. I'm lucky. It could have been a lot worse. Oh...my point...yes...sorry about that..I do go on. My point is yes you are right......they are also the symptoms of benign fibrous breast disease. But that doesn't rule out a malignancy.. ",

      "Content": "Apr 12, 2017 12:21AM - edited Apr 12, 2017 01:08AM by Synth I had pain in my breast from the bc. There are a lot of nerves in the breast...how they can tell us that there isn't pain with bc is just bs. If the doctor I saw hadn't kept saying there's no pain with bc I wouldn't have waited as long as I did to insist on being checked. So..yes there is pain and because it's most likely a nerve involved the pain radiates and may cause numbnes in hands and fingers. I'm here if you have questions. I'm post surgery many years now. 17 since the initial mastectomies. And four years post Lat Dora flap recon. Synth PS I had no bump lump or tumor, but they found calcification on the mammo and in a ultra sound. They did a needle biopsy and was ductal carcinoma in situ. They needed to go back to get clear margins and they couldn't. I decided on the mastectomies because frankly I was tired of the hassle. Wow. If only I'd have known what would happen. But I didn't. I have been unwell for many years. I don't want to scare you, but if you should have a malignancy think very carefully and follow your instincts on what to do as far as surgery and reconstruction and chemo and radiation. Many of us believe that we are alive DESPITE treatment. Many of us also consider ourselves survivors of reconstruction as well. someone once wrote that cancer treatment kills more people than cancer does. That's something you have to feel for yourself. One thing is for certain, if you feel in your heart that a certain thing doesn't \" feel\" right or \"sit right\" with you ..then follow that instinct . It won't be easy. Because of all the things we believe in in this this life, we seem to have the most trouble believing in our own instincts ...in believing in ourselves. The body never lies. I read that book a long time ago, if you come across it , read it. Please. In the mean time. I could show you some self healing techniques that are pretty awesome and will be beneficial for sure, no matter what the diagnoses. Btw...you may have a pinched nerve in your spine causing that pain in the arm. Synth ",

You have enough going on without having to remember every thing your doctor tells you, so having a friend or a volunteer even from the cancer Center tobe there with you will be so helpful. That person can also help you navigate through the system and help hold those in charge responsible, hopefully preventing another mixup.",
