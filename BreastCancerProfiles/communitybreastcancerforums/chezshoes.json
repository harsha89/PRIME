I had a fine needle biopsy yesterday for a 7mm mass in my right breast. There were issues from the start - equipment malfunctions, arguing between the radiologist and the ultrasound tech, and the radiologist himself, who had the most horrid bedside manner I've ever encountered! On the positive side, as he was removing samples, he made the comment that they \"looked like normal breast fat.\"  After the third sample, since the mass was so small to begin with, he said he could no longer see the mass so he couldn't take any more, placed a metal marker at the site, and sent me on my way. Just curious if this is normal procedure - \"there's nothing left to see, so that's all we can sample.\" I was a little worried about the fine needle biopsy in the first place, as it's the least accurate from what I understand. And now I'm worried that mine may have been especially inaccurate, because between equipment issues and the size of the mass, it couldn't be seen well. Any advice would be welcomed. Thanks much!

I'm going through a similar scenario myself: slacked for a couple years on my mammos, finally went in, was called back for more films (well, digital anyway) and US. US showed a solid mass - having a biopsy on Monday.  Can't offer any advice to you, but let's think positive thoughts for each other :)",

Especially if, like me, you tend to be the type of person who always has a plan :) Good luck to you. I'm sure you've heard the statistic before - that 80% of lumps turn out to be benign. Keeping this in mind was helpful to me during the waiting period. ",
