It is discolored, and it feels like there is no tissue underneath. I have an ultrasound, and mamogram scheduled for this Thursday morning. I am so sick...I cannot help but think/feel the worst. I am curious to see what your results were. My case sounds so similar to yours. I am trying to be hopeful, and positive, but it is so hard. I am 35 years old with no history of bc in the family. Any thoughts?",

Bayoubabe I think I may just go get a massage :) sounds like it's just the thing I need. I promise to keep everyone updated....",
