It really does seem our breast go through a lot of changes, but it is best to get them checked to be on the safe side. I am sure yours will turn out ok.  Believe me, I understand worrying - I think I have worried myself to sickness over the last month about the breast discharge. Good luck.",

It seems to happen when it is stimulated i.e. clothing rubbing against nipple or if I press or squeeze the breast. I went to the gyn office and they did a nipple smear, which came back ok. They also did a diagnostic mammogram, which did not show anything.  They did an MRI of the brain because they were looking for a pituitary tumor, which they found.  It is extremely small and my prolactin levels were normal, so the endocrinologist does not think this is causing the discharge, but he is running more bloodwork to look at my hormones. Anyway, in the meantime I am going to a breast surgeon on Monday.  I am so scared.  What if they find breast cancer?  What if it is there, but they haven't found it yet? I have read many sites that say discharge is rarely a sign of cancer, but the articles also say to look into it when the discharge is unilateral, clear and spontaneous.   I am so sick of worrying about this since December..... Would advanced cancer show up on the mammogram?  I know mammograms are not 100%, but I got a digital mammogram and they took extra pictures of just the nipple.  I have no idea what the surgeon is going to say or what other tests I might have.  I am 38 yrs. old and feel like this may be due to hormonal issues, but I worry about breast cancer.  I wonder if they find breast cancer if it is early breast cancer and treatable?   Please help..... Your opinions are welcome.    Thank you for listening. Nicky  Log in to post a reply",

Thank you for all of the support and I will check in periodically to see if I can add anything from my experience. By the way, the doctor assured me that clear nipple discharge usually ends up being a hormonal thing, even if it is unilateral.  She said it RARELY is cancer. Good luck Nicky ",

They have chalked it up to hormonal. I did have a brain MRI to look for a pituitary tumor (prolactin) and they did find a very small pituitary tumor, but because there is no prolactin in my blood and because the tumor is so small the endocrinologist is saying that he doesn't think it is causing the discharge.  The breast surgeon isn't so sure that the pituitary tumor isn't causing it.  Anyway, the discharge is periodic and does not happen all of the time.  Also, it doesn't leak a lot of fluid - no clothes staining or anything like that.  It seems to happen more when my nipple is stimulated and clothes are rubbing against it.  It seems to get irritated and then leak a bit.   I take Evening Primrose everyday because I am trying to prevent cysts and I was hoping it could possibly help with the discharge.  The surgeon said it can't hurt and she recommended I take it.  I do see the breast surgeon this Friday, so I will talk to her about all of this again.  It looks like I will be seeing her every 4 months or so for follow up.   I still get scared and wonder what if I have breast cancer, but they just haven't found it.  I don't have any other symptoms but clear leakage every now and then.  Does anyone else have this issue and if so what are your docs doing about it, if anything?  I wish it would just go away because I am so sick of the worry. By the way, I am 38 yrs. old. The radiologist that did my ductogram said that clear fluid is rarely ever cancer.  She said she has only ever seen 1 case of it being cancer in all her years, so that is at least positive.  Even so, I always have that little voice in my head saying something else.  Arggghhhh - very frustrating.

I did not realize that the Primrose oil had estrogen in it.  Maybe I should stop taking it.  They did a lot of hormone work on me because of my pituitary tumor and my estrogen levels were normal, so maybe I don't need extra.  Thanks ",
