Whatever your age BC does happen as I have experienced with very young friends and witnessed on this very site.  I commend your vigilence and advise that you have a right to know what exactly the lumps you have are?  You need assurances and hopefully, from those assurances you can get on with your life. I commend you for sharing and asking advice.  It shows a maturity that you mum, when you speak to her (as you must) should be very proud of. Love, hugs and good luck Nikkix ",

I'm thinking that even if they are benign they will want to remove them because of my history and the fact they seem to be growing fast...?  I had multi-focal the first time and had to have a mastectomy.  Has anyone out there kept their breast with multi-focal?

I hope you have spoken to a gyno about your lack of periods...?   You may well have common ovarian cysts which are better monitored. Best of luck Nikki x ",

Hope this helps, Best of luck and sorry for your DX. Nikkix",
