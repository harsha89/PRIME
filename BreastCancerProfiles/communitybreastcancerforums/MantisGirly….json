So we need help: Drs, chemo, radiation, tons of support from wherever you can get it. Except maybe from the ice cream in the freezer :). Second. yes. Yes you can do this. No, you will not be alone. The people who will be part of your treatment will be there for you. You can come here and write and whine and moan and be miserable, but note I personally have grown an undrownable spirit, so I keep popping back up from underwater, so too, I imagine quite a few of us have. as you can, too. You can do this. I promise. We have swimmy rings on around here...;))",

My understanding is that everything our bodies are made of can develop cancer, including salivary glands and tear ducts. There's probably cancer of the eyelash. Sigh. So I'm sure we can develop lymph node cancer, or lymphoma. But in my case, for an example, I had breast cancer that had moved on to my lymph nodes. It was still breast cancer, just spread to nearby axillary lymph nodes. Your doctor has biopsied your lymph node, but it would be good to confirm the DX. Sometimes we don't hear anything after the first two things our Drs say, so we get mixed up when we try to remember exactly what was said. I felt like I had been smacked up both sides of my head w a couple of cast iron frying pans, so I couldn't process much of what I was being told. Very frustrating, and an unwelcome source of anxiety. See if you can get a hard copy of what you need to know to take home with you. I should have done that. I tried to take notes, but I did not do a good job of it. So, lots of confused anxiety and fear. Let us know what you find out. big hug!",
