You will get all the information you want through this board as  all the members  besides struggling  during treatment , after treatment have  come together  from across the countries  and sharing   thoughts, experiences and many more or even family matters.

I am able  to know  about the BC and now quite relief  on how to tackle it in future. I found this thread  after  completion  of my treatment.. say after a gap of 5 years. Can you imagine  how I tackle  it by myself  with only my doctors advice. You are free  to  share  everything , and  wait and see  huge response will pour  on your posting. Sneh,",
