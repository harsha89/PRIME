I have a phone consult with Dr. Massey on Sunday and I am really excited about it. I am hoping to be a regular on this thread and really get into the exercising.

I can't believe how motivating you ladies are!

So Dr. Massey thinks just by doing the diep that she will minimize my lymphedema and it might even go away- I am so nervous and excited at the same time.

I am due to have surgery a bmx this Wednesday Oct 24th, I am so tired of waiting for the surgery date to come it feels like forever I was diagnosed on Sept 28th. I am so nervous what the pathology report will look. I had a biopsy, that found a 2.5cm lump in my left breast and a positive lymph node. I then had an MRI that showed the lump to be 3cm and that there was more than one lymphnode positive...at the time of the MRI they also said that one of the lymphnodes behind the breast wall looked swollen and that if it that was positive they wouldn't be able to reach that and I would have to have radiation to that spot, I got that phone call while walking into my Petscan. I spent an entire weekend planning my death and got the phone call with the results of the petscan on monday with bs beginning with the words \"are you ready for some good news?\" thank god was not behind my breast wall. I still worry though, I wonder how good the petscan is. Does anyone have pain in their breast before diagnose? I have been having pains for months which I thought might have been heart related and after being diagnosed and biopsy the pains have been worse, like sharp pains. The bs said it is my muscles reacting to the cancer, that I am have muscle spasms. I will post again at a later date cause my 9yr old daughter keeps looking over my shoulder. Good luck to everyone!",

I might head to hosp today to have them check it out. There are some clots in my drains and it is much darker than it started. She said it might be old blood since I had a hematoma in hosp. I really thought this surgery would be easier on me since Ive been through 2 back surgeries. I am now scared of the diep flap I will now have at the end of this horror. I haven't cried once since I've been back from surgery, when my 9 year old girl seen me for 1st time after surgery she screamed with excitement \"Cancer Free\". I wouldnt want to burst her bubble and her see me crying. I also have a 4 yr old boy that has no clue except the fact that he can't hug the arm with the pink bracelet on it. Has anyone else had clotting? Thanks for the laughs Dulcigirl, I would be the type to calculate too.lol",

Didn't take the non producing drain out since she said sometimes when you take it out the other one will lose suction. Cindy -I am terrified of drain removal, cant believe it was that bad, sorry you had to go through that Mary- I can imagine that being very upsetting but I am sure it was just because you are not used to it and you think everyone is aware of it, Im sure you looked fine Grier-happy birthday! we are the same age :) Pathology report came back 3/30 nodes positive and 3.4 cm tumor ER+ PR+ Her2- I couldnt of been happier, I thought I had more nodes involved. Either way having cancer is sucky but I guess this is better than expected. I was upset to hear that it will take 6 months after radiation to have the diep, I wasn't aware of that. So this morning when I woke I was so drained and could barely stand to brush my teeth, I was so upset thinking I was getting weaker instead of stronger- the bs told me that it was because I stopped taking pain meds and I should continue to take them, that I need them. I have been taking again and I feel much better. I was also thrilled that she said I could remove the constricting bra, what a relief. I used a home depot work cotton work belt around my waist to put drains in. I guess I will go update my profile. Goodnight Ladies",

I spend a couple of hours on here a day, (almost obsessed) but I don't post very much. I have had a few real down days since I met with my MO, I think reality set in even more. I need to go wig shopping this week. I cancelled an appointment I had with the wig place since MSK were able to see me on Friday since they had a cancellation. This hair thing is on my mind more than it should be but I just can't help it, I have hair down to the middle of my lower back. I thought of trying the cold caps to keep hair but the MO told me that chemo wouldnt work near my head area and would if I had lingering cells, that is where they would go. She definitely didn't sugar coat ANYTHING. So I guess I wont ice my nails or toes either because what if it cant get there either. I have spent the last hours on here in the forum where the 5+ years ladies check in, it is very inspiring and makes me feel better, I have been crying extremely easy since appointment. You girls have been great and uplifting, you all have such wonderful attitudes. I am so happy to hear that some of you have had none to very little side effects. I start dense dose chemo (every 2 weeks) on 11/28 for 8 sessions. First 4 are AC and than 4Â  of T. They gave me a bunch of prescriptions to fill, I am going toÂ  compare them with everything you said you took MGDSMC, sounds like you handled it well. Good night all, hoping for a better day tomorrow. I Will be praying for all of us. Glad to hear your mom was ok Grier :) Bet",

I needed to come into my office and do end of the year stuff and while Im usually very good with Math and calculating I needed to call my mom to make sure I was doing it right. Very frustrating! I am leaving soon, I feel useless here- I had my assistant come in and I think I'll tell her she can leave too, there is really nothing going on. Its alittle over a week and I am over the hair buzzing. I haven't seen my barehead yet, I switch from scarf to wig. I have to say, I really love my wig, it was a small fortune but worth it, I get so many compliments with them not know it isn't my real hair and the people that know say wow, if I didn't know I would never think. That makes me happy!",

Thought I might end up in ER with dehydration since I wasn't able to drink liquids. A friend came by today with some med marajuna and within a half hour I was back to myself. It was actually a chocolate cookie, I only ate1/8th of it and was feeling great, eating and drinking (not high). My oncologist had said it was helpful as long as I didn't tell her about it.lol...hadn't needed it till now! Dont know if I mentioned b4-short term memory loss terrible. But my breast cancer was not evident on my mammogram, I was very lucky that my Gyno found it and sent me immediately for a ultrasound instead of just mammo. I was told I have very dense breasts. Question- are any of you planning on a diep flap after radiation? I am, it can't come soon enough- 6 monts post radiation",

First infusion today- I am doing four rounds of AC and then four of the T. Wasn't as bad as I thought, the anti anxiety medicine they subscribed helped- Avitan. They gave me all kinds of meds for nausea, I am also on steroids. Wishing to get that energy everyone talks about from them. So far I haven't moved off the couch in 5 hours, only to use the bathroom and eat. The only way to make me happy is think that I am 1/8 done with my treatment. Glad I found this board, very helpful!",

I am going to pick up the wig I bought, she is cutting it exactly the way mine is now. I feel like if I wear it before I need it I might get used to it and not freak out as bad. I have to say the TE are my biggest complaint right now, they are only filled half way but drive me nuts while I'm sleeping...so much pressure. I'm considering not filling them anymore since eventually I am doings diep flap. I am taking the Claritin for the neulesta plus taking the compazine a couple of times a day and the aches and nausea have stayed away. They only gave me steroids for first couple days plus the emend. Wishing everyone a SE free day!",

I am day 5 from AC #2...this treatment was harder than the first on me. I have some nausea, a headache and fatigue (still working) but overall the only real complaint is this hair loss. I knew I would lose it, I think about it constantly, this is the horrible to me, worst than losing the breast, I am not taking this good- I wish someone could put me to sleep and wake me up when my hair regrows- I know it sounds so petty and vain but I can't help but feel this way. I hope everyone has minimal side effects",

My mom came with me and I didn't look when my hairdresser did it, she then restyled my wig and I went home with that. I changed from the wig to a scarf in my closet since it was the only place with no mirrors, and didn't look this morning either when putting on wig, wonder how long I can keep this up. I went to work with wig which looks a lot like my hair and someone I do business with walked in and said, \"you have a new hair-do, how nice\" I tried to be vague and change subject but they went onto ask if I had plans of going someplace special with my fancy hair...ugh, couldn't change subject fast enough! My scalp hurts today and we only used a #2 blade.....This whole thing is so traumatic. Today I stayed at work the longest I've stayed since I was diagnosed, I really physically good @ 6 days past tx#2. Bracing myself for #3 which I get the day after Xmas. I haven't noticed anything with my nails as of yet. It's great that most of you are able to do some work from home. Btw I love the topless in Walmart, that's awesome!

I take emend, it has worked great. Dakota- I swear I can't take sedative stuff normally, the ativan just really takes the edge off. I take it before I go for chemo as well. Try taking 1/2 at first if you feel edgy (hard to break those little pills though) Priscilla-hoping white blood counts come back up for you. I would try some lentil soup-its full of iron",
