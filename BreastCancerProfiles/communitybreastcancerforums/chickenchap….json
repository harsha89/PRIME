Hiccups went away.  I had water in the bedroom but that wasnt getting rid of them, so I went to the kitchen and drank some grape juice and that got rid of them, for a short time, came back, more grape juice.  :)  I have tried the sugar before, that has worked in the past as well.  Or drinking water upside down sometimes works.  Wonder if its a low sugar in my body causes them?  So far, havent had them again today.  I came to work today because I felt fine.  I figured if I stayed home I may be tempted to do some chores I shouldnt do, so best to sit at my desk at work.  :)  Other than feeling a little bit dizzy once in a while I feel fine.",

I appreciate everybody's support, you folks are amazing!  Thank you.",
