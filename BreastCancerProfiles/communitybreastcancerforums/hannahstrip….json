The worst part of any of this is the waiting. I have many friends who got to the biopsy step and did NOT have cancer. there is just no way to know right now. Based on what you said about the place you went - maybe go somewhere else for a second opinion. You need to have a place that you are comfortable with - whether this ends of being cancer or not. Definitely call and push for answers on Monday. Try not to panic. One breath at a time. try to spend the rest of the weekend doing something fun for yourself - something you would enjoy. Go for a walk - make yourself look around and appreciate the sun and the weather. Two pieces of advice that I hope will help - talk to people. I know you said you don't want to worry your mom but wouldn't she want to be there for you during this tough time - to listen and reassure you. I too didn't want to tell anyone when I was going for my repeat Mammogram or my biopsy - only my husband and myself knew. It made it harder for me to act like everything was ok - it wasn't. Once I told people, it gave me some form of relief. Second - use these discussion boards - they have helped me so much from the beginning and still help me with anything I am going through! So many strong and supportive people are on here - listening, reassuring, sending love and I have always been able to find others in the same condition I was in and it always helped so I never have felt alone!! Hang in there! One breath at a time....",
