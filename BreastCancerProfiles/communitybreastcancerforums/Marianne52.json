Mine are going up every week which has me concerned. Please keep in touch. We can compare notes. Marianne",

The first week I got Cisplatin and week two Taxol was added and I now get both drugs each Monday for 12 weeks. I am also taking a pill each morning as part of a Clinical Trial for Triple negative IBC. After three weeks of treatment I haven't had any side effects until yesterday. I am having pain in both knees and legs. At times it feels like fireworks going off inside of me as I am having shooting pains in my entire body. Has anyone else experienced this? Also, when do you usually lose your hair as I want to shave it before it starts to fall out . Thank you in advance for any advice you may have. Marianne",
