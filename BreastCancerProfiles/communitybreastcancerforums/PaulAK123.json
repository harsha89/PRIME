My breasts are painful, both, but they feel like there are a lot of big, hard masses in both breasts. Some smaller ones, but mostly large, hard, dense, masses. The top quadrant on the right side hurts the most. I noticed my breasts got much heavier and denser over the past few months, but I attributed it to weight gain/stress/hormonal changes....but now I am worried. Will call my doctor as soon as the sun comes up. Log in to post a reply",
