My oncologist did the usual blood test, talked to me for a few minutes and said, \"Everything looks good. Ill see you in 6 months.\"  I said, \"Are you sure?\" I have a high chance of recurrence plus I have Stage 3 cancer!\" He did not even check my mastectomy scar. His reply was. \" Yes, your chance of survival is just as good as anyone else's. When I got home, I thought about this and became extremely angry! Isn't everyone suppose to have a 3 months checkup at least for the first 2 years when the chance of recurrence is the greatest? I feel like I have been ignored once again! Would you guys pick another oncologist if you were me? Please let me know what you think? I think 6 months is too long to wait! thanks for you advice!

I had the mirena to prevent irregular bleeding and 8 months later, I had 3 cancerous tumors in my left breast. Some people were saying that they felt that the mirena contributed to their breast cancer. I thought I would bring this question over to the Stage 3 forum and see if there was anyone else out there who used the mirena and felt the same thing. If not the mirena, maybe you were using something else that you felt may have been a factor.
