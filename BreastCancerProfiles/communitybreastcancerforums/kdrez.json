Three days ago I woke up and my whole body was convulsing in ever direction. I couldn't get my arms, legs, back, hands, feet or head to stop moving. I got scared and closed my eyes and told myself to make my body roll over. It took me about 30 seconds to roll over and everything stopped. My heart was beating so hard and my muscles felt exhausted. I calmed my breathing by taking slow breaths. Now, I'm worried it may happen again. My sleep pattern is normal and I don't eat after 6 p.m. Just wanted to get some advice, because I sure don't won't to have to see my doctor over this. Any advice or suggestions would help greatly.",
