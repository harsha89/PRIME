I don't know how I feel I am so confused. I spent today making a new patient appointment with a local cancer hospital getting films, reports. I now have appointment Monday for a MRI  7/25/11 and an appointment with a surgeon Tuesday. .. I don't have a family Doctor . I have never written anything on the internet before. I have read some postings but I find I am just getting overwhelmed.
