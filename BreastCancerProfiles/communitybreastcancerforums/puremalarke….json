Three years ago at New year's I decided to quit coloring my hair after 25 yrs plus of it. I had quit smoking and the dingy gray roots were now a pretty shade of white. The first couple months were horrid with the root line so I got a beautician friend to put highlights in my hair to help with the transition. I didn't want a short haircut because of an ugly scar on the back of my neck from an laminectomy. Got it all grown out and had some cool streaks going on just in time for my Sept 2015 dx of bc. So if prior growth is indication I can hope to have shoulder length hair in 2.5 years!",

I'm having 37 treatments. I'm not sure why and plan to ask when I see the dr. again next Monday. I didn't really want to start this week just two weeks off of chemo. My eyes and nose have been watering all this week. Yesterday when they finished they asked me if I could stay that the counselor wanted to introduce herself. It didn't hit me until later that all of them thought I was crying.",

I think the recurrence number was 13 % with in 10 years on mine. I decided I'm pretty healthy now and the best chance to do all I could to lower the odds. I hope not to ever fight this fight again. I'm halfway done , the second treatment much easier than the first. One thing my dr and I discussed was that he would be okay if I stopped treatment because of side effects but I'm pretty sure I'll make the last two. Good luck whichever choice you make for yourself. :)",
