The doctor checked my WBC today (11 days post chemo) and it was 1400.  So now I am on antibiotics and will receive the shot starting with round 2.  Can't wait to have more energy to keep up with the kids!    Has anyone specifically asked their oncologist test the tumor for the topo2 enzyme?   ",

Glad I found this thread.",
