We will work out the property so he can live in our retirement home, but my kids eventually get it. We have another house we share and that should be his.

I've seen too many widows and widowers in my retirement home that have found a happy future together that otherwise would be very sad and lonely... Hope that your husbands find that solace and that the lonely women do too.",

Let's just get started. I suppose once I am started... I'll be sorry not to appreciate a little reprieve like now, so I need to enjoy my couple of days free from doing anything... I guess... but no one can do that, can they? So this afternoon, I will be back to painting. I am an artist, focusing on watercolor. I just finished a book (only days before diagnosis), \"International Watercolor Artists, Book 2\" and the darling artists from around the world have sent me all kinds of wonderful caring notes on FB. It is so uplifting. So, for now, I'm doing great... but it makes a huge difference to hear from my BC new friends. Love to you and good luck on your next step. ",

Would like to know other people's experiences with chemo.. I was able to tolerate herceptin, but I believe the others are like poison to me... more than most people.

It is so horrible to never know for sure, or have drugs not work. sorry not to write individual notes. I have had VERY good news. My liver biopsy came up negative. I was warned by the doc who did it that if it was negative that would not be conclusive because it was very difficult for him to get to, but my oncologist is quite happy and has declared me a not Stage IV (for the time being). He says we will know for sure if we see no changes in it over the next month, because he is finally starting chemo on me Wed. Wants to do chemo before surgery ... a bit of a new approach that seems to be working well for those who have tried it. I'm all for it, because I don't want them putting it off and then seeing the lesion in the liver grow. If, it is not cancer, or not a BC related cancer, because it is in only one spot, they can also remove it with surgery. So we will see after about a month of chemo. If it is reducing in size, that is both bad news and good news, since it means it is a liver met, but it also means it is responding to treatment. I have to admit I am a bit scared about starting chemo. I will have 4 drugs (I'm also HER2 positive) 1x every 3 weeks for six sessions. That's about 4 months. Is that a typical time for chemo? More or less than normal? understanding that there probably isn't a real normal in all of this. Of course I'll lose my hair, but that's no big deal. Not losing my life is the real thing, but I do fear the nausea and some of the other symptoms. I am fairly overweight, but they are warning me not to continue to work at losing... (I was on steroids for 8 months and had gained 20 lb. and now have lost (on purpose) 5 of those 20). I am trying to eat healthy and avoid sugar and white starched... lots of protein. Any suggestions or comments? What a difficult trip for everyone. So sorry, that so many of you are younger than me. I am 72.. and that you must do this at this time of your lives.

My doc is throwing the kitchen sink at me, but I have a lot of confidence in him. Let's hope I can handle it. I just read Woodylb about the Carbo and will ask my doc about it... But I'll start with what he says and see what happens. The real trick will be whether or not the liver met receds. For me... if it does... that is not good news, because at this moment it is a possibility that it is not my BC and that will be the evidence that it is, if it responds. Ironic isn't it, to be hoping it doesn't reduce in size. Because if it is not BC it is either another cancer or nothing important. If it is another cancer, it can probably be removed. IT is the only one there. I'll let you know how it goes tomorrow. My friend is taking me and we are fortifying with books, food, blanket, socks, games, cards, etc. etc. Party time... Let me know how yours goes. Yes, I'm scared, but trying to make it tolerable.. I think it will be. Sorry you have to go so far for yours. Hope it works like magic. Remember, every day, every year, they develop more magic for us. And those of our sisters who have made it through 10 and 12 years didn't have anywhere near as many options as we have, starting later. But I guess you started a while ago didn't you. Still... remember... they are still really working on a cure. That's for us too... Love to you.",
