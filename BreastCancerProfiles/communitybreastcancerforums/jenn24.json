I was super nervous about the procedure because the one I had 4 years ago was not a good experience at all. I'm happy to say that today's biopsy was much better! Of course that may be because I opted for Valium this time! :) Like I know a lot of you are, I am now waiting, 5 to 7 days, for the results to come back. I'm scheduled to meet with my BS next Thursday to discuss the results but they will call me if they come in before that day. Ugh, the waiting. I know you all understand what I'm talking about I just felt to need to vent! If only I could just fast forward to next Thursday!

This time my doctor has prescribed me Valium to take before the procedure. Have any of you taken Valium prior to the biopsy and did it help? My nerves are already shot between worrying about the pending results and my fear of the procedure itself. She gave me three pills, maybe I should just take one now!
