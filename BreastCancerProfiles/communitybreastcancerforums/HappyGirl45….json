I have an appointment with PS on Tuesday, I would be surprised at this point if he takes out the drain...especially if it is still draining like it is. Wednesday is appointment with BS to go over path report...keeping my fingers crossed.    All, Hope everyone is doing well and all are in my prayers!     Have a great day!",
