My answer to \"Oh you are so brave\" & \"you are holding up so well\" I have been stage 4 for 6 weeks now and getting the pitty looks and advice. \" why aren't you home resting?\"  I have a plurual effusion which makes me puff, BC cells in the fluid with mets to left coloar bone and left Nodes.  Other than the puffing I am fine and wouldn't know I had this bloody thing (glad I do though)  Every one seem to tell me to go home and rest but I just can't sit around and wait to die. I quite like my life and want to live as much as it while I can. I have been joking about getting a shirt with \"I'm fine\" written on it to drop the asking rate from 10 mill times a day to 1.5 Mill. lol If you are not stage 4 i don't think you could understand. I never came here before dx because my boat on denial never travelled this way, it couldn't. Now I have dropped ancor and my denial boat is hoping the rope holds for 10 yrs.  see how we go. Nicole  (sorry about the ramble)",

I had a bad cough for the last two weeks and could go to work last week thought it had turned from a dry cough to a chest infection so went and saw G.P and got antibiotics on Mon to see ONC friday. Anyway up all night bloody coughing sleeping all day. Saw Onc said maybe its from fluid in chest again. (I didn't think so) but they did a chest Xray and then drained 1.5 litres out!!

This should perm stop the fluid build up. I have chatted with others on the boards who have had this done and they find it to be of great benefit. So no more chemo till they do this then we will be looking at changing drugs. Not sure to what yet. We purchased a new ride for our amusement business and are loving it.

Had my Op last Thurs all went well, they got nearly 3 liters out when they fully drained it. (wow) Ended up in ICU that night, apparently the pain meds affected me a little to well and I wasn't breathing properly. (falling asleep and forgetting to breathe) so they hugely reduced the dose and it all came good after that.  From all accounts in the forums the procedure was to be a very painful one and it was't till it started to heal a little that it hurt like a son of a b***h. But the Drugs are my friends and have been helping me through it, they are soooo nice.....lol...  My feet are swollen and have a bit of a cough (also to be expected) but getting there slowly. While not all better yet I can tell already that when healed it should make a big difference. Yeah! Over all at this stage glad to have it done.  Saw Onc yesterday and am starting back on chemo next Friday on a new drug (for me) Xeloda. haven't done my research yet but will let you know how i get on. thanks for all the wishes love Nicole",

Opening the boards and praying that one of my dear friends did not have bad news for us. But it seems that I am the winner in the mets lotto after all. Last week my lung cavity filled with fluid and after a week in hospital they drained it, sent it for test while I had ct and bone scans. The fluid had mets breast cancer cells as does my chest wall (lung cavity filling with fluid again) and left lymph nodes.(opp side to previous bc) I am starting chemo next week with a new drug called Abraxane.  Onc says a cure is no longer possible but we are looking for control. Not sure what to say to friends and family (children) Sarah is 12 now and Jack 8, they understand so much more this time. Sorry to dump this on you, I will check out the mets boards also.  Thankyou love Nicole",

Yeah  I didn't see Onc this week but will phone on monday for blood work results. We may need to wait a little while to see results? but the fluid in my lung cavity feels better after treatment so hopefully it's working. I have spoken with the kids and they were a bit O.K (been there done that) and are really not bothered. We haven't mentioned anything about not cureable this time and if they bring it up we will deal with it then. It's not something they need to think about if they don't have to. I know I try not to!!!!  Susan, you all here are a massive part of my \"real life support system\" I know I can say things to you all and you will not judge or say \"oh don't think like that\" because we all know that some times you have to.  I know that you are the only ones who truly understand. Tina, thankyou the long term survivors give me hope. in 10 yrs my daughter will be 22 and my son 18 that fills me with hope. Peg thanks for the healing thoughts Calico, this is a successful 4 year anniversary. THE SEPTEMBER SISTERS SEAT ON THE METS BUS HAS NOW BEEN FILLED. THERE IS NO ROOM FOR ANY OTHER SEPT SISTER TO RIDE. So just relax! I will take this journey and take up the whole seat so there is no room for any of you. (if only that was how it works, here's hoping) anyway all good here thanks Nicole ",

Jack doesn't really rember last time that much and thinks I just gave myself a silly haircut. (as if that is something i would do? lol) Blood work came back with very good results. My tumor markers dropped from 485 to 340 with 3 wks on abraxane and one week off. I have had 2 more tx since then and although my hair is 95% gone (doesn't bother me, summer starting to arrive) and alittle tired (go to bed when needed) breathing getting there slowly. It's all good!! Still working, something I know I could not have done last time. So kicking cancer Ass and loving it!!.. Susan, I had a chest mri about a month before the fluid in the lung symptom and it didn't show a thing. I sometimes felt that looking to hard was like wishing it on yourself (stupid I know) but if the test thing is that hard for you don't do it. Watch the markers and let them be your guide for testing. As I said earlier my marker count is now at 340 does anyone else know what there's is? Is normal count 0 or being post txt is a count below 10 normal? I saw someone on another thread freaking out cause hers was 3 and went up to 6 ( I thought half your luck, but then it did double) Tumor marker counts are not something done regularly as follow up here but makes you think if 0 is normal 485 should have been picked up a bloody long time ago.   Love to you all Nicole",

Nothing anyone else would notice but I notice it....  We have had a productive session with a councilor and will be telling the kids about the more serious out look for this round of treatments when my Daughter returns from their School excursion to Canberra. (Capital of Australia) We wanted her to enjoy her trip away before we shared the news. I have a wonderfully supportive work environment, with my sick leave having been used up long ago the Catholic Education system has decided that I should do what I can and they will pay me on full wages anyway. So even if I only work 1 hour, the full 25 or none at all they are covering my wages till the end of the year. How amazing is that??  I had my first day back in 3 weeks today and did paperwork for 3 hrs then came home and rested. It was great. They are also orgaising that through the super fund income protection insurance I can access a further 6 months wages at 75% pay with no obligation to do even 1 hrs work.  you never know where your blessings are going to come from.

Our amusement ride business has reallly started to grow and we have had bookings every weekend since October, as well as my job at the canteen. We have just purchased some mini dodgem cars (kids under 8yrs) to add and it is a very exciting time. Back home now from our two week caravan holiday at the beach, the rest was great. Not much else going on untill the Australia Day long weekend 26th January. Health wise not to bad. I did have a bit of a scare about 3 wks ago the lymph node on the right side of my neck (surgery side) was swolen and sore to touch (like my lump) went into a panic then saw Drs and it was just an infection. Antiobotics fixed in less than 24hrs. Phew! In the mean time before seeing dr I went on a bit of an \"I'm not putting up with this S*#t\" rampage! all ended well though came away with a pay rise at work!!! Had a good christmas except for the MIL (what a biatch) for the fourth year in a row she gave me a tin of short bread cookies (value $3.50) they are millionaires. Anyway hot on the heals of the not putting up with this rant I told her exactly where and how she can place her cookies! (no sun shine there baby!..lol) With a bit of luck she will never speak to me again. Anyway we have had lots of rain the sun is shining today and looks like it will be a beautiful day! I am going out to enjoy it. Love to you all Nicole",

The abraxane has stopped working with a cell count drop of just 3 points this time. During the 3 weeks I have had off to have my lung fixed the lumps in my chest have become noticably bigger. The cancer has become more aggressive and is spreading faster. Hopefully the Xeloda can contain the spread and slow it down. If not I may have 6 months, any case 2 years is optimistic.

Wow before christams.  Hope you had a merry christmas and great new year peroid. I had a very wonderful christmas, nothing fancy or anything we took our caravan to the beach like every year but then we stayed there, previously we would put on a christmas dinner production back at the house and run around all day.  This time we had cold BBQ chicken, Creamy pasta salad, fresh king prawns (OMG - they were good, 2 kg for 5 ppl) fresh bread rolls w butter. Drinks chips lollies etc,,, then we had home made christmas pudding w custard or ice cream or fresh fruit platter.  The whole atmosphere was relaxed and easy it was heart warming and enjoyable....  We took our rides down to Taree for NYE and had a great night. got a couple of new girls to work for us and it all went well, going down again 26 th Jan for Australia day celebrations. Health news isn't looking so good though. We had some early indications that the Xeloda wasn't really doing much. I think its slowing the progression a little but no enough to warrant the side effects. I have mets on my spine and ribs and the stitch like rock is back in the r/h side of my upper abdo. My feet are swollen with fluid up to my knees and my head tilts down to the right where my head/ jaw now rests on my collar bone.    The pain meds are working well so that is all good but other than that I am fairly screwed. Dr thinks we are looking at months/ weeks rather than years/months with 6 months being optimistic.  I now need to decide do we try another chemo drug or not being that do I want to be sick for 2 weeks out of the maybe 20 I have left? at the moment I am thinking I might like to get a second opinion. I haven't seen another Onc and maybe a new one might have some new ideas.  It was Jack's 9th (son) bday on friday we had a lovely day and will have a party when the kids go back to school and then Sarah's 13th (daughter) on 9th March. So since it maybe my last we are going to pick a W/end in Feb and have Jack's Party on Sat then Sarah's on the Sunday inviting everyone they know. I will be the party of legends!!!!  LOL sorry for the downer, I have felt your love and prayers  touch my heart please keep them coming. Nicole",
