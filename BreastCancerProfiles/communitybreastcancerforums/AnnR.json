    "Content": "AnnR wrote: Hi, I recently passed the three year anniversary of my diagnosis and treatment.  I visited this site frequently when I was going through treatment and found it very helpful in understanding what was going on, what questions to ask and what to expect.  I'm checking in now to offer some perspective and encouragement to those that are in the middle of the treatment saga.  I felt like I got back to my old self fairly quickly after radiation.  The tamoxifen gave me a pretty good dose of hot flashes - but I never knew if it was the drug or something that would have happened anyway.  I always said that if I couldn't stand the hot flashes, I could give up coffee again - but never got to that point.  I recently switched to exemestra and discovered that it really was the tamoxifen that was creating the intensity of the hot flashes.  I've also been doing the zometa trial - which doesn't sound as promising now as it did when I started, but at least I'll have strong bones!!  I think about the risk of the cancer coming back periodically - especially when I go for the mamogram check ups or have a pain I can't immediately explain - but so far, so good and my doctor says that I've gotten through the highest risk period.  For the most part, I am focused on everyday life with the only difference being a heightened sense of appreciation for what's important and patience for things that I realize are not all that important.  I have a deep sense of connection with people that either have been or are going through this experience.  Best wishes to you all!  Ann R.
