It is almost like I have drank a cup of coffee..I get very jittery within 30 mins of taking them. The only thing I have found that helps with sleeping is Ativan but it gives me a headache. Plus prochlorapazine for nausea makes me really tired too. I can then sleep 3 to 4 hours. Maybe try some tea or a favorite drink and I find I sleep better in front of the tv then a quiet room lately. Crazy I know..sorry Hun that you are in so much pain and I hope that you can find something that works for you soon. Everything is worse when we are tired. It makes you just want to cry. Gentle hugs coming your way and hope that you can get some relief. Hugs Kimber",

Then three years ago I broke ten ribs in about eight weeks from being weak from bone Mets and the pain was more than I could handle. I had a pain mgmt doctor and he felt I was a great candidate for an interthecal pain pump. It took me about six months to do the surgery . I never regret for one moment that decision. It keeps me very well controlled with my pain. I have eight extra injections each day if I need it. I get continual meds without all the SE. Your bowels are normal, no,foggy head, I could drive again. For me it was amazing and from the doctors point they like it much better and multiple meds can be put in it to help in several areas. I have pain meds with a mild numbing agent added. It also is great for continuity you never have highs and lows . It is delivered right into the spinal fluid so it can be much less. It is a 300 to 1 ratio....meaning if you need 300mg of morphine with this you'll only need 1mg for the same effect.  I know it isn't for everyone but there are always options. No one should be in constant pain",

After my first six months of chemo I was having the same issues and they sent me on to have a cystoscope done to see why I couldn't go more than 10 mins without the ladies room. I was on taxol,carboplatin and herceptin and I was driving 2.5 hrs each way to chemo in the far north so potty breaks were hard. I wasn't drinking enough first and second wasn't stopping to go to the little girls room so I burned the inside of my bladder from not diluting the chemo with staying hydrated and expelling in a timely manor . This basically eventually caused me to constantly feel like I needed to go like a bladder infection would but I didn't have the infection. What I did have was second degree burns on the inside of my bladder with small bumps . They put me on nitrofurition and hyoscyamine. I took them together for over a year but had to stay on the hyoscyamine because I had permanent damage to my bladder from the chemo passing through my bladder and not drinking/hydrating enough and expelling in a timely manner. I now ask the dr for extra fluids with chemo and I try to drink like a fish day of chemo. I've since been told by the doctor Taxol is one of the harshes drugs on your over all system. I hope you get feeling better soon. That UTI feeling stinks.  Hugs kimber",

There is a nerve there that will trigger a constant tickling/coughing need sensation. Also the dryness from the chemo you may be on will exasperate this all. FEC and abraxane were my worst chemos for dry mouth. Try using the halls soothers and refresh, lemon heads will make you salivate more too that will help with that constant tickle you get from coughing. Mine is much better when my mets are responding to the chemo I'm on but try to keep your self hydrated as best you can. I've also been given the pearls for coughing when it is real bad you just have to be careful with those ..gentle coughing will help you keep your lungs clear so your doc should remind you not to over use them to ward off pneumonia . I know it is overwhelming but you will have times it does get better. Gentle hugs coming your way.",

I had a double mastectomy and did 12 months of chemotherapy. Earlier this year in may I felt some pain on my right side and oncologist started with a ct scan then, MRI,ultrasound and a petscan. They found a small mass under my right implant on petscan and small lung nodules. Did surgery biopsies in august that came back benign. Was in the process of moving so I had to change oncologist and wait till the end of September. New oncologist didn't like the fact that my side was still in so much pain and thank goodness listened to me and did another petscan to find that mass was larger under implant, lymph nodes in the axillary are involved..lung nodes have grown significantly and lymph nodes in the para aortic are now hot too! Just did two biopsies and new ct on Thursday and it came back malignant. They explained that the cancer has been now categorized as met cancer and they were making an appt with a surgeon. But of course I couldn't help but look at everything that is online and I feel like I can't breathe after reading everything. Thank you for letting me vent. I'm trying to not scare my husband and kids I'm 44. Hugs Kimber Dx 10/31/2007, IDC, 4cm, Stage IV, Grade 3, 12/40 nodes, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

This is my first christams since my DX of stage IV and I'm waiting to start chemo next Monday so I'm antsy too! So I can relate. I have to say I have been surrounding myself with only positive people first. We watch what we watch on tv or movie wise. We keep it light funny and things we love. The other nite my daughter and I did a glee marathon. Today my son and I played a favorite Wii game of ours! We had so much fun being silly while running through the world og hog warts :) I try to do whatever it takes to keep my mind busy and spend as much time as I can with my family making memories. That laundry and dust bunnies will still be there tomorrow. I also love music so we have CDs constantly playing. I can't sing to them anymore I'm to winded from lung surgery but I can hum:) I pray you can find something that makes you smile! I have also recently made the decision if I need to cry..cry get it out but don't let myself linger. If I'm mad yell get over but try not to linger in my funk. I have been writing a journal and I think that helps me get things out also. I have started one to each of my kids on things I want them to know. It has helped me to express my feelings. I hope you find what works for you. Hugs Kimber",

Try to put several drinks by you with straws in the so you can constantly sip on them and eat foods that bind you. I've gone to eating peanut butter toast or oatmeal for breakfast. I add rice a lot as it will absorb the water in your system and help some.

If you go to your american cancer society they will give you an inexpensive wig so you can see if you like it. The first time I lost my hair five years ago I spent almost 900 on a wig and I wore it twice. I wish I would have tried the free one first..I dislike wigs for me. It made me warm and itched on my scalp. I've gotten used to being bald most of the time now. I hope you can find some soft skull caps they really help at night when your head gets cold.

The right lung poses more of a problem the mass isn't along the edge so bigger surgery. But they need to try one step at a time. We talked about radiation todaay..with it being on the chest wall they want to do that as soon as I recover from surgery and once they have the full mass will look at other treatment options. Just wanted to give you all an update as I have to spend the whole day tomorrow back at the hospital having scans. Plus doing pulmonary tests. I started antidepressant as I'm typing this and dr gave me Valium to help. Maybe I will get some sleep! I really can't thank you all enough for your kind words. I will try to keep you posted as we find out more. I at least feel like now we r doing something positive!",

So yeah! I have scans in the next two weeks and hoping it is still doing the trick. I get Aloxi and emend it keeps me fairly comfortable. I've lost about 10 pounds while on this regime. I don't throw up but I'm very gaggy all the time. I also can't stomach anything with tomatoes or acid. So my diet has changed slightly. Between the perjeta and the Navelbine I have both diarrhea and constipation. A few days of each. I'm currently two weeks on and one off. I'm fairly good my third week but a bit more susceptible to flu/colds. My counts are a bit all over but I've not had to miss any treatments. Really nice thing is it is an eight minute push so it is a very fast chemo to get. My hair came back but is very slow growing. My legs are super slow growing still and not complaining. I only have about an inch on my head but it is better than nothing. I was bald from abraxane prior to this chemo. Honestly it is a doable and effective chemo once you get the SE manageable. My prayers to you both that you have good results. Hugs Kimber",

They've both explained that part of it is because the top layer of our skin is a fast rejuvenating skin..which means obviously it grows fast..lol..sadly so does cancer..most chemo treatments are designed to kill fast growing cells.So our skin dies off too quickly making it blister and dry and peel off. I've been on steroid creams to emu oil. Tried even hemp oil lotion a friend gave me..made me scream it burned so bad. My feet are cracked pretty bad and bleed a fair amount. The best combo I've found is the steroid cream twice a week and then I use revitaderm derm at least once a week. Podiatrist gave me this it moistures a bunch but has slough cream effect. It can be used more often but my feet are very raw. I use eucerins professional cream that has a high content of urea that the doc thinks is wonderful. This all does help but nothing has fixed it..I'm so sorry you are having this problem. I hope it gets better. Kimber",

We found the VA to always be extremely slow and not always the best doctors. The VA pays for its Doctors insurance ..meaning malpractice coverage included. Sometimes this will have the VA hiring doctors that aren't always the best. I know there are good/bad Drs all over but we found a higher saturation of overworked/under qualified/ often out dated in the VA. Like I said it was only for about 10 appts for his disability retirement appts but it was a broad spectrum of types of doctors and I wasn't impressed with any of them. Potential try calling your local VFW and ask some of the members there opinions. You may have a great hospital in your area I am really sorry your insurance is so expensive. I know that is tough on a limited budget.",

My first was the worst..had to have emergency surgery to remove my port at the time..I had clots in my neck down my subclavian all the way to my wrist. I spent six months on Coumadin till they resolved to help keep the blood thinned. The anti coagulants don't help the clot shrink ..just keeps the blood thin so they don't worsen and your body does the rest. My PEs happened this year while I was on Coumadin so onc has said I'm on lovenox for life. With PEs the just hospitalize for a day or so the pain to control the pain and get you used to the shots.The doctors actual like the lovenox more so because with our health being so fragile and emergencies arising lovenox can be reversed much quicker than Coumadin in case of the need for surgery. You also dont need bloodwork with lovenox like coumadin for your iNR which i was thrilled about. I've been doing the shots since march and it is doable. I hope you get things under control soon. Feel free to PM me if I can help in anyway. Oh just wanted to add you can use your bum also for shots. I rotate a lot so as not to bruise to much. Also your doctor may let you go to just one shot once the clot has dissolved:) I can't since I've had the to often but the onc said generally they do that after your follow up ultrasound is all clear.

Just spent six days in the hospital and didn't have my IPAD first few days and went insane. You lovely ladies and gents are my support,teachers,cheer squad and dear friends. I'm 44 an accountant by trade but being an AirForce wife by choice for 24 years. We have had the pleasure of living in several different countries we spent 20 years out of country. My husband just retired from the air force but works right back for then just in a suit. I have two children that are my reason to live. My daughter is going to be 22 and has been accepted to nursing schools twice now but has graciously put her life on hold due to my cancer. She is going this summer we pray as she has applied again to nursing school. She has two plus years of university and wants to be a peds oncology nurse. My son is 19 and my sunshine..he makes me laugh all the time..he is in his second year of university to be a network engineer like dad:) If you can't tell my family is my life! I was first DX at age 40. I was stage 1 but a rare 1 percent chance of a lymph node higher up not caught at sentinel node biopsy is what led me to stage IV . The cancer basically set there for almost four years growing..spreading. Last summer I found out how bad..masses kept showing as scar tissue on ct scans prior. But a petscan in July 2011 started my journey..then a move..new dr's ..new petscan more progression. I have mets to both lungs, axillary masses, axillary lymph node, para aortic lymph nodes and a mass in left arm. Did surgery this past fall in December to remove axillary mass and lymph nodes, my reconstruction and about 40 percent of my right lung. Started chemo FEC..by third round had major reaction and now know progression. That was last week and have found out I have pleural effusion now and mild ascites. I went septic from something but I'm just so thrilled to be out of the hospital. Praying we can start new chemo in two weeks if I get my counts back in order. It is on to taxol and herceptin next. I pray for all my BCO sisters daily..I think you ladies with our broken down bodies are the strongest individuals I have ever known. Sorry for the rant above I love talking about my family but hate recounting my cancer journey. Hugs kimber",

I had a double mastectomy and did 12 months of chemotherapy. Earlier this year in may I felt some pain on my right side and oncologist started with a ct scan then, MRI,ultrasound and a petscan. They found a small mass under my right implant on petscan and small lung nodules. Did surgery biopsies in august that came back benign. Was in the process of moving so I had to change oncologist and wait till the end of September. New oncologist didn't like the fact that my side was still in so much pain and thank goodness listened to me and did another petscan to find that mass was larger under implant, lymph nodes in the axillary are involved..lung nodes have grown significantly and lymph nodes in the para aortic are now hot too! Just did two biopsies and new ct on Thursday and it came back malignant. They explained that the cancer has been now categorized as met cancer and they were making an appt with a surgeon. But of course I couldn't help but look at everything that is online and I feel like I can't breathe after reading everything. Thank you for letting me vent. I'm trying to not scare my husband and kids I'm 44. Hugs Kimber Dx 10/31/2007, IDC, 4cm, Stage IV, Grade 3, 12/40 nodes, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

Finally got backdown the stairs  and went to the ER in wretched pain. They did a CT scan and doctor came in and said did you fall down the stairs. I looked very puzzled and said no...he said recent car accident? ..I'm like NO...etc you get the idea for him to then show us 10 rib fractures. It was bad for about a week when I coughed. It is a very sharp pain I find it will ache slightly until you move then the worst pain.  So please get it checked out. I've since break one every few months. Now I know the pain and I don't freak..there really isn't anything they do for one other than pain pills. It was that episode though that led me to getting the pain pump which is amazing!

I know we have had similar problems just moved while getting diagnosed so kind of hard to start an executive job were I live now and ask for all this time off. Living without my salary is killing us too! But what arebyou going to do! The ladies over in the stage IV area are amazing I know they have been a huge help to me and this has been my outlet. When it seems the rest of the world just doesn't understand these amazing sisters will scream, laugh, cry, celebrate or just be there with you no matter what you need. I pray your BOSS gets a clue and let's your co workers help you! Hugs Kimber",

One thing I have learned since we were military (moved a lot during treatments)during both my diagnosis' is that being at a university hospital if possible is better. They will approach things more aggressively in my opinion. Because they are constantly trying to stay ahead of the game. Now with that being said I was floored a year ago when I was DX stage IV that I was given many options for drug treatments. But my oncologists always bring my cases to large tumor board meetings to present and have colleagues weigh in on the best treatments. The first time it was a 60/40 split between what you would call aggressive chemo or hormonals. I chose the chemo for six months because my onc and I both felt it gave me piece of mind. But obviously 40 percent of those doctors felt that hormonals would have done the same. So don't beat yourself up and I know it is hard. I think the medical community is as divided on the subject as we are too. Plus on hormonals you do have a better quality of life in my opinion. I know they aren't a cakewalk but no comparison as chemo. Most important is your piece of mind your onc should always be open to let you make the decisions with their guidance. Hugs kimber",

Six weeks later from second pair of new glasses can't read again and it is now like looking at everything with a steamy shower or fog effect going on. ..Honestly my cancer is actively growing I thought I'll pass before I'd need surgery but this is quick now. I'll need to look into surgery in the next few months. Just wanted to see if anyone else ever had these issues and if so how long did you need to stop treatment to do each surgery? Dr explained to me that the radiation exposure I've had has exasp the natural growth process 10x normal. I had my first issues with driving with it today.

I was in the hospital for about a week had so little spinal fluid they said my brain MRI looked like I had a flat tire in my skull.  I've used antidepressants but for me the SE are worse than the help they provided for me. I know so many that they help tons. So try to stay positive ..allow yourself moments to grieve but find things that make you laugh. Be careful what friends you let into your circle. Only those that are positive for a while. Keep those that cry or make you upset at arms length for a while. Indulge in some favorite goodies..retail therapy is nice too. But try to keep things up and up and try not to let your mind wander. Nights are my worst time. I will only watch a positive movie or show, read a romance book, anything that helps you escape a little bit. Sorry I'm no help with the antidepressants but I've been there and have learned how to shake it off. Gentle hugs that you find your balance in this bad situation",

I've tried a cream that my oncologist makes you have to get it at a compound pharmacy tried that for a month daily it just made me bleed.

My body had built up a tolerance to it and I was scared to go off the medication. Mostly that the anxiety would return with a vengeance. In the last couple of years with changing dr's due to moving it became more and more apparent to me that I need to do something to come off this medication. Please like everyone has suggested make sure your dr is properly trained and if you are taking this med regularly don't stop cold turkey. I tried this once I was only on 1mg a day but it put me in such a horrible anxiety state. It also gave me palpitations, cold sweats, restless nights..etc I thought I was addicted to something much worse than just clonazapam. I went back on the med and back to the dr and with controlled help over six weeks got off the med using a light dose of Valium temporarily. I felt horrible that I had let this happen to my self and the guilt was worse then the SE. So I do give a warning..make sure your dr knows what they are doing. I would never want to see anyone go through this just for some sleep. My dr has given me Ativan for anxiety of stage 4 but I have chosen at this time to only take it once. Got that horrible headache and then just decided I would rather live without it for now. It is a very personal choice and everyone deals with there anxiety differently. There are some great coping skills you can learn. A quick one is use your fingers to manually on your leg or table form the alphabet starting at Z. This will within seconds make the brain reboot and send a dose of serotonin to it. It helps so much if you suffer from quick onset panic attacks. I use it a lot in the dr's office. Sorry for the ramble and I hope you find what works for you! Hugs and understanding Kimber",

I just need to navigate my insurance now covering all this..I'll start at my internist and let him get things started. It did just what several of you ladies said it snuck up on my quickly. Chemo has screwed with my eyes tons over the yrs. I kept blaming it on needing new glasses but two sets in the last few months and I'm still noticing issues.

I too have heart issues prior to cancer. I've had three heart surgeries and I won't lie it is trying at times with chemo. I take multiple heart meds to make my heart work super easy plus Lovenox too keep my blood thin and easier to push. If had issues multiple times that have caused us to take a month off from chemo and the heart will repair during that time. Possible other chemos to consider are tykerb or afinator. Even on her break ask her to ask for faslodex or another hormonal it will help protect her to a point. I took faslodex on both of my breaks. Plus I'm sure she's been through counseling for the congestive but there is so much she can help with that especially her sodium intake..it will increase her fluid retention and it makes your blood pressure elevate. I've known of my heart issues since I was 13 and I'm careful to the point the Drs are surprised I don't have more issues. I know it is hard but tell her to try to keep her spirits up. Hugs Kimber",

Because I have a heart condition that the fast acting ones bother..I get bad palpitations on them. The inhalers were just started in the last few months..I'm almost at the point that I need oxygen I keep a pulse ox at 93 now..but it can drop lower..I was told once it sits in the high 80's oxygen will be started. I've also had vats surgery and I now have mixed opinions on that..it removed a very large mass but I lost 40 percent of my right lung. I can't say for sure if it is surgery or just natural progression. My lung is having problems it sticks together often and it has now adhered to my ribcage very painful. That is from surgery. But on the flip side if I didn't do the surgery I couldn't even talk anymore I coughed so bad..my lungs stay filled with mucus. Post surgery I can now talk normal without the cough. It just starts once I overdo now. I also have mild pleural effusion. My lung dr does an X-ray and lung function every month. I do scans roughly ever 3 months. I wish you luck and just remember my situation is unique..I don't mean to scare anyone just want everyone to think about both sides:) If you have symptoms I'd strongly urge you to get a pulmonologist in the mix:) hugs kimber",

So I've been on it for nearly 3 years but we used it monthly for six months. I had so many mets on my rib cage two years ago I got the flu and from coughing fractured 10 ribs. They said my ctscans looked like I'd been in a car accident. We went to every four months after the initial six months. About a year later the lesions went active again..so we now have gone every three months. If they can limit how often you get the drug you can get great results and limit the odds of osteo necrosis. Many of us don't have five years..but if you can get to the lesions to go dormant go to the fewest treatments to maintain that state. Good Luck!",
