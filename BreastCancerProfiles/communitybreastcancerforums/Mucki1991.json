Sounds like you have a good team working for you. Lymph nodes will checked during surgery and sent to pathology that's the only way to clear then so try not to jump too far ahead. Deal with one test at the time . Your emotions will be all over the place and that's perfectly normal we all go through it. Just keep putting one foot in front of the other and stick around to get advice from those who have come before you. These ladies are pretty awesome here!!! Best wishes for you",

Everyone told me too waiting was the hardest part but now I'm in treatment and I disagree with that. While your exploring options it's not a bad idea to research and interview a few plastics DR too. If you find yourself needing a mastectomy you don't want to feel rushed in making that choice of DRs either as that person will determine how you look when it's over. There aren't any test that can definitively determine node involvement except a tissue test. My MRI showed no nodes yet final pathology show a 2.4 mm tumor in a node and smaller tumors in other nodes. So that question can't truly be answered until surgery.",

Also you want to consider Haynes men's t shirts for comfort and the messy creams. I wear mine inside out because even the seams hurt right now. If you have a lumpectomy it may be a little easier as you still have breast tissue and my skin is very thin from surgery. Sidenote I had my implants done prior to treatment so I'm not sure how much worse it would have been with tissue expanders. Best wishes for you ladies.   ",

I did buy comfy PJ's with front openings and a few button up shirts. Guess I have been putting it all off to avoid reality but I'm here now at least for the moment. Dropping my scripts off today too. Trying to get my deep cleaning done but it seems I've come down with my first cold in 7 years so def not feeling it. If I don't force myself to stay focused I will slip back into doing nothing. I have stopped worrying about possible node involvement and possible treatment options. Seems like things can change with each new appt est ect so I'm learning to just let it be whatever it is It takes too much energy and stress to fight the universe. I should know, I have been doing it for the last few months.

Granted I am biased as I'm still recovering from my mastectomy and I did everything I could to save my boobs. Also nipple sparring can fail and will you still be okay if that happens? If you remove the breast but don't do hormone therapy ( if that's what has been suggested ) you can still get breast cancer as its impossible to remove every cell from the breast tissue. Not trying to upset you just offering a view from outside. I always respect our rights to choices we make about our bodies. ",

I'm cut across the mammary fold and then up to where the nipple would be, those still look rough but I'm hopeful. thinking I'll start chemo in two weeks meeting with my Onc next week.

My chemo plan was/is dose dense red devil ( that's every two weeks) and 12 weekly taxol. Chemo effects everyone a little differently and here's my words of wisdom... DON'T compare your symptoms to others they are yours! Chemo is much nicer to some than others while I have controlled my nausea by staying ahead with those meds, my fatigue and nerve issues have kicked my azz. Ask for and take pain meds there is no reason you need to be going through cancer and be in pain or not sleeping. Chemo brain has made for some funny stories. Oh also take an electric blanket to chemo so I'm not freezing the whole time. Counting weeks was too depressing for me so I counted treats made is seen less daunting. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions. ",
