Maybe it's webbing, because it's also a kind of cording? It's been a week now with no improvement, it's actually getting worse (the cord is more defined and longer and the pain is worse). But I'm hoping to find a new oncologist, and after the PET Scan on Sunday will try to also see a Dr specialized in vascular issues (veins mainly) because I want to make sure that even though it hurts it's not dangerous. I'm trying to find exercises and stretches to do online, in addition to the ones I've been doing since the surgery. Thanks to your advice I will try to find a PT. Again, thanks so much for the support. Cyber hugs back atcha.",

For the dry/chapped/itchy skin you could try using plain olive oil, it really helped me, soothes itchiness, and moisturizes wonderfully. You might smell like a salad for about a minute :) but it goes away almost immediately, and does give great relief, even on the lips. Since the chemo I've been trying to steer clear of cosmetics with chemicals, etc, and the natural stuff works great. I threw away all my creams. On my face I've been using a mix of Coconut and Almond oil, and it's moisturizing just as well as the big brands I was using before; I even use it to remove makeup. ",

You are a warrior :) Urdrago, congratulations on your grandson!! and so sorry you had to go through all of that with the Xeloda! I'm so scared to be starting my hormone blocker (Tamoxifen) because some of the SEs can be life threatening (stroke, uterine cancer, liver damage), but the fear of recurrence is right there on the other side. I should have started last month, after I finished rads, but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. Had a long discussion (argument) with my drs about it. I'm still not convinced. It's the same argument, trying to fix one thing but spoiling a bunch of others. I'm still dealing with the fallout from the chemo, including the whole struggle to stand up straight and walk (I still forget and end up doing this pretty funny stumble hobble until something kicks in and they start working, lol) Really horrible when it happens at work. If anyone else has this you can try moving/stretching your feet around for a couple of minutes before you stand up, it makes it better for me. Linda, I'm so sorry for your loss. You're right. We can't overthink our lives. What will be will be. All we can do is try to be our best selves and live our best lives, day to day. Engine, I hope Janice is feeling better. So much to go through :( Life, I love your attitude, it's like I can hear you speaking in your posts :) So much of what you write is exactly how I feel. I'm also back to working 2 jobs, not so sure it's the best idea but I don't really have a choice right now. Silver lining is that at least I'm strong enough to be back I guess. InnaB it was so weird to read about your swelling cause today I freaked out when I discovered a swelling over my right collarbone (the BC side). After the panic and palpitations subsided, I guessed it was probably lymphodemia, because I've been having pain in the surgery areas, and in my arm and my armpit is a little swollen. I neglected my arm exercises for a few days, and was sleeping on my right side (which I know I'm not supposed to do). I hope that if I behave the swelling will go down. Otherwise it's back to MO Will try to add a pic with my funky hair. There is absolutely nothing I can do to make it behave, including gel, mousse and creams. Will just have to wait it though :) . It's almost harder for me going out with it now when it's so freaky than when I was bald and went topless. Sending good vibes and big hugs to you all :)",

This is something I have to look into but am also worried I'll just end up rubbing them all off. How are they holding up so far? Ingerp, your hair looks strong and straight :) and what a thoughtful gift from your former patient. My hair is still uncontrollable without heavy duty gel etc, but I've started coloring the grey with semi-permanent L'Oreal Castings. I've done it myself 3 times, and every time is an adventure because my hair never turns out the color it's supposed to :D I think it's because I'm 75 % grey post-chemo. Instead of being light brown last time I'm now a coppery red, but it's all good. I'm having fun with it. Engine I'm sorry to hear about Janice's neuropathy. Is she on an aromatase inhibitor? After only 2 weeks on tamoxifen my hands and feet were back to Taxol level discomfort. If she is, maybe speaking to her doctor could offer some solutions. Urdrago you look fabulous and so glam :) I can't wait for you to show us some of the nail stamping! GA Warrior, so sorry about the complication with your incision, thank God it's not serious and I hope it heals quickly. Krissy37, hope that the remaining Zomata infusions are kinder to you. It's such a long seemingly endless journey we're on, but looking back over the past year shows us how much we've already achieved and survived. I had my 4 month checkup with the visiting oncologist, and my ultrasound & mammogram were good (just some remaining inflammation and density, and slight lymphodemia near my collarbone from the radiotherapy). My Mondor's is almost completely gone (YAY). He wants me to go on Femara instead of the Tamoxifen, but will have to do a bone density scan 1st. Also have to redo my blood tests in a month because one of the tumor markers is on the high side. I'm not too freaked out about that, I don't trust them anyway. My tumor markers were normal when I was diagnosed & stage 3, and they've been up and down since then. Anyhow, I hope everyone had a restful and peaceful happy Easter; and wish all a joyful Passover, filled with family, and love and Good Health!!! ",

I've been lurking on the site for a couple of days, wish I had found you all when I started this journey, lol. Surgeon & oncologist recommended surgery after the chemo, to shrink my tumor, and I've already finished 4 rounds of AC (I just want to forget that part), and seeing everyone's early posts has given me so much comfort (and information!). I wasn't alone (or crazy!) in feeling like my ears were unbearably hypersensitive, the 7 day debilitating fatigue (feeling like I was in a black fog); the insomnia; feeling (and looking) like a different person. Anyway, I'm having my 5th Taxol (out of 12, weekly) tomorrow. Taxol is a whole other beast, and although I'm much more aware and mobile on it, I have so many pains I didn't have on the AC. I don't get that much information from my oncologist - I live in Egypt, and doctors here don't really deal with patients as sentient beings, lol. Doing my own googling usually just freaks me out, but thanks to you all I have so much new information and questions for my dr (about my rapid heart rate, poor liver test results, immunity, gene testing etc). Will have to take a 12-day break from the treatment for travel, going with my daughters to Canada to drop the eldest off for Uni, move her in, etc. So scared of the trip, scared I'll be too weak to actually accomplish anything and especially anxious because my immunity is really bad. Anyway, it's been so hard to share what I'm feeling, even surrounded by a loving and supportive family, and it's been so hard to feel like I understand what's going on (chemo brain has hit me hard), that this group is a God send, and I'm so grateful to all of you.

It's been a while, and between traveling, not having my laptop, being exhausted and dealing with jet lag this is the first real chance I've had to check in. Thanks to everyone who gave me tips on staying safe during the traveling! I used face masks, gloves and tons of antibacterial wipes and hand sanitizers. The masks I brought from home caused terrible chafing, too stiff (in the picture) but I didn't dare take it off, everywhere was soo crowded. I bought much better ones from Montreal for the trek back. I took Black Seed Oil for an immunity boost, vitamin C; and Milk Thistle for my liver. I also started taking claritin and what a difference it made! As scared as I was about the whole thing, I'm glad I went because it pushed me out of my comfort zone. I've been so scared to venture out or push myself physically since my diagnosis and starting the chemo, and with this trip I didn't have any choice. I think I needed to find out how far I could push myself. One result is that I'm passing by work tomorrow (I've been off since my diagnosis), with the same anxiety as everyone else about the high stress, etc, to see about easing back into work. I love how everyone is pushing forward, it's such a comfort to share in your experiences, I don't feel alone. I know exactly what everyone is talking about, and I know that they understand what I'm going through as well. I've given up for now on the hair issue (I've got some peach fuzz on top, all grey; lost all eyelashes, and about 80% of my eyebrows). I go topless most of the time (when I can) because covering my head just makes me feel clausterphobic for some reason. What's really bothering me is the weight gain. Not what I was expecting, but I suppose it's from turning into a couch potato during the AC, plus menopause? (will not admit to late night chocolate binges). I'm sorry I'm not great at calling out to each one of you in person, but heartfelt congratulations to everyone ending their chemo sessions, starting surgery or rads, or starting their hormone therapy. I can't wait to catch up!! Got back Sunday night, and had my 6th taxol Monday morning. 6 more to go. Bless you all :)",

I had to diagnose myself off the internet; it's a very rare reaction to breast surgery which is similar to cording in the arm, but it's down my left side. Extremely painful. It's a swollen vein. My oncologist wasn't concerned, and said he couldn't feel anything, even though my husband and I could. Had an ultrasound and the technician could feel it, but said there was nothing showing up on the screen. So, I'm having a PET scan on Sunday. And. Yes. This is around the same time last year when I got my dx. I'm just freaking out. I was supposed to have the PET scan today, but at the last minute I called and postponed it. I'm being irrational, but I'm scared. Anyway, if anyone here has any experience with Mondor's please let me know. I'm trying to find a new oncologist as well. Emailed the French specialist I was following up with but he hasn't answered. Not doing well on Tamoxifen so I stopped. Another thing to worry about. I went through the boards here, and will probably try to go back on it more gradually. But now that I have Mondor's I'm even more scared about the circulation issues it can cause. I'm sorry it's all so negative, but I needed to vent and no one else understands what it's like.",

Good luck InnaB with your last chemo! Increasing my protein intake really helped me with feeling faint. I was also reading an article on this site about neuropathy from chemo, and one of the effects can be drops in blood pressure that cause fainting. Worth asking your dr about it. We're all at different stages of this process, but heading to the same finish line.

I don't feel up to going to actual classes yet. Life1963 good luck with the (horrible) shoveling! Hope everyone is safe and warm in this harsh weather. Ingerp it's so interesting to hear about your cording; my symptoms started after I'd been really pushing myself working out at home. Linda the way you feel resonates so much with me too. During treatment I was in zombie shock mode, now it's hitting home in so many ways, the fact that I'm stage 3, that it's almost the same time last year that I found out, not knowing how much time I have till it hits again, dealing with the chemo/rads leftovers. GA Warrior is right, it's a kind of PTSD. In the middle of trying to find some kind of center, our 6 year old Great Dane was diagnosed with bone cancer, and after lots of back and forth and arguments he had surgery and his leg was amputated last week, it's been so rough seeing him go through this, and at the same time feeling this kind of anger that cancer has hit our family twice in the same year. The cancer cloud is all around. A good friend of mine just got diagnosed with ovarian cancer (I love her and it's so hard seeing her go through the same emotional trauma I did last year). My 17 year old daughter's close friend lost her mom to stomach cancer yesterday, and seeing her friend go through that has freaked her out about me, which is freaking me out about me too and what her and her sister would go through. It's a slippery slope and we all need to fight to climb to the top of it instead of being swallowed by it. But we also need to feel these feelings, let them out when they want to come out. I think seeing a therapist is a great idea (it's on my list: new MO; find a PT; find a therapist). In the meantime, I'm so grateful you are all there for me to vent to. Much love ladies and Engine :)",
