I also had 12 lymph notes taken out of left arm and three in right arm. I noticed my right arm had a little swelling in it so I ask my doctor about it and he said to elevate it when I sleep. That was about it. Now my left arm is swollen like the pictures above. I had an appointment with my radiologist and she made  an appointment to see a PT. This site has been very helpful. Thank you so much. ",
