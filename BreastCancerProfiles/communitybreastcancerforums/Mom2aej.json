(at least they will be a week from friday). I have a strong history of BC in my family so I have been insistent on annual mammograms. (Bi annual 30-36, then yearly after that). I knew Cancer would be something I would eventually be dealing with but if figured 10 year down the line. Not just after 40. (my mom was 52 at diagnosis) Just breath and see what the doctor says. Hopefully you will not have to be here but you do....... So far I've meet some great women and gotten some great information.  Good Luck",

I got my visit 2 days before my first dose of AC.I remember getting crampy and such and thinking this is really not something I wanted to deal with now.  It continued on fairly normal. My onc said that chemo does not necessarily affect those hormones in all people. My luck would be I keep on going. I am scheduled for an OOPH (BRCA + and family history) but had to post pone it until chemo is over. Not looking forward to menopause at 41 but that is where I'm at. I do say that every time I start, part of me is looking forward to having that over with. Of course after the chemo its the hormone blockers that will cause havoc next. Its just never ending at times.",

I am only one week after diagnosis and so far have only meet with one BS. and that was the day after I got the news. I had not yet found this site and had no idea what questions to ask. I figured I would hear the doc out and then research and read what I could find. I meet with a different doctor tomorrow, now armed with more questions. I did like the first guy I saw but I want to get a few opinions first. Thankfully I have caught mine early and I have to time to make these decisions and not rush in. I have settled on the fact that I want a BMX. To strong a history for me to ignore. I knew I would be dealing with this just not at this point in my life. I am hopeing that if all goes smoothly I can get the surgery in May, while the kids are still in school.  Good Luck with your  surgery",
