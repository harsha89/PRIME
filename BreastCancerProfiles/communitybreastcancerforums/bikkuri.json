I was diagnosed with Stage 3C invasive ductal cancer last Dec.  Since then I have had a mastectomy, chemo and radiation.  I am now on Tamaxifin and Nolvadex.  There has been little in the way of follow up and it is making me nervous.  I have had hip and knee pain, as well as lump in my left breast in the same area as the tumor was in the right.  My doctor did an ultra sound of the lump and said that it was nothing.  He ordered no tests to check the hip. I live in Japan and wondering if things are done differently other places.  I was told that I was high risk, but there doesn't seem to be any follow up.  No imaging. I do not want to be paranoid, but I'm wondering if I should be more aggressive about getting some tests done. Thanks for listening.  Log in to post a reply",
