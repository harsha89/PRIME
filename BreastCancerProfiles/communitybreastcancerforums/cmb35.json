I realize that on the one hand it's crazy to \"play with fire\" in this manner (I found out about the BRCA status almost 2 years after finishing treatment, so I had a lump w/rads instead of a mast.) On the other hand, after the implosion of a really crappy (in hindsight) relationship a year and a half ago, I am now in a new relationship with a truly wonderful man. And well, without going into detail, I need some assistance in that department, because if not, it's downright painful. Sooo..... for now I've decided to do the 3 months of E-string, and then see what happens. I guess I'm hoping there is some sort of residual effect, or that the \"use it or lose it\" advice is true, and \"using it\" will somehow improve the situation without the help of the E-string. I'm also in the process of investigating the BPM (had my ooph this summer), which woudl negate the E-string issue (and open a whole other host of issues instead! LOL) I think Tender said it best, you have to ultimately do what you're comfortable with. I will tell you that my onc was not really hot on the idea of the E-string (and that was BEFORE the BRCA info) and my gyn refused to prescribe it for me without a referral from my onc. For me, I think I'm giving myself these 3 months, and then I'll probably not insert another one and see what happens. Good luck to you. Just make sure YOU'RE comfortable with whatever you decide. PS. Tender, I really don't know what we would do without you on these boards!",

I told him the next day after I found out. He knew something was up anyway, what with me having surgery and all. Here's what I told him, \"I have breast cancer, but I think I'm going to be OK. I'm going to have to have chemotherapy, which might make me sick, but that's what's going to make me better from the cancer. I will make sure you are OK, and I promise you that you will be taken care of while I go through this.\" It was really, really hard to tell him. He asked me if I was going to die that night, and I was at least able to 100% assure him that no, I would not die that night. He was very concerned about it just being the two of us, he was afraid I was going to die and that he would be the only one here and he wouldn't know what to do. (I know, brutal right?) I did tell him that while no one could say for sure, that in my heart, I believed I would be OK and that I would beat the cancer. There is a book called, \"When a Parent Has Cancer\", that I would highly recommend. There is a book for the kids inlcuded in it, called, \"Becky's Worry Cup.\"  It might be a little bit young for your son, but still helpful I think. Big hugs to you, feel free to PM me if you have any questions about anything....",

I'm not sure if you're a single mom, or if your husband will be helpful in comforting your son. I did my chemo from July - Oct, and I was able to keep my son really busy during the summer months with friends and sleepovers. I wanted him to continue to be as normal a 9 year old boy as he could be given the circumstances. And yes, I was always positive and strong with him. I never lied to him, meaning I never promised him that I wouldn't die of cancer. I told him that no one can be 100% sure of anything in life, but that I felt as positive as I could that I was going to be OK. He was more than happy to jump right on that train, and while I have learned that even he still has those fears lurking in the back of his mind, (I thought it was just me), for the most part, we are both still chugging down the \"Mommy will not die from breast cancer\" track. Hope you are able to spend some good time with your son this weekend, and that he is as OK as he can be.",

This thread got me to thinking about stupid things doctors have said to me. I have three doozies: 1. \"Well, they could be a little bit bigger.\" (PS in response to me saying I didn't want my reconstructed boobs to be larger than I am now.) 2. \"Great, so in that case we'll just cancel that mammogram then!\" (Overly cheery response to me saying I was comtemplating a BPM in the next few months.) And I'm sorry, but this one really takes the cake! 3. \"Wow, I guess you were pretty much doomed from the start, huh?\" (Moronic NP's response to my family history, which for some reason she was obsessively asking me about, which made no sense, because I was there for a  freakin' PAP smear! And BTW, the family history is grandmother, 3 maternal great aunts and 1 aunt all dead of bc before the age of 50.)",

First of all, thanks for the kind words, shoulders and positive thoughts, it helps. I swear, I feel like writing a \"So You Found A Lump?\" guide! I found a lump, went to the doctor who said, \"yes, that's a lump\" (thanks!) I was due for my annual mammogram that month anyway, so we proceeded with that. The mammogram tech got that look on her face, you know that look? She said, \"I don't know what it is, but you need to take these films right now, and drive across town to the ultrasound facility for an ultrasound. Go right now!\" The ultrasound tech got that look on her face, that pity look? She left and got the radiologist, who came in and said, \"I don't know what it is, but you need to make an appt with a breast surgeon.\" As I was making the 5 minute drive home from the ultrasound place, my cell phone rang. It was my primary care physician, who I have never met, calling me to say I need to follow up with a breast surgeon! The breast surgeon didn't get that look on her face. She simply said, \"I don't know what it is, but 80% of breast lumps are benign. We'll just take this lump out, that way we don't have to worry about it.\" Had I known better, I would have questioned why I wasn't just having a biopsy! I had a lumpectomy (no one ever used that word, I didn't know that was what I was having), a re-excision and SNB, and then a full AND. No one ever told me I had any other options, and I didn't know enough to ask. I realize I can't undo what's been done, but I am so angry at her that she didn't explain things to me. I was only 41 years old for crying out loud. I feel like she should have told me that if I was to have another cancer and therefore need a mast, which hello? I'm hoping I have a good 40 more years on this planet so the chances are pretty frickin' high, that the radiation would impact my ability for reconstruction. As far as my Dad, he didn't do it intentionally, and God bless him, both his parents were dead by the time he was 5, but still, had he told me the correct information 3 years ago, I would have had the BRCA testing prior to any surgery/treatment, and would have had a double mast to begin with. Now I'm faced with the prospect of lopping off my boobs without facing an immediate cancer dx, just the statistical threat of one, and well, you know... Yikes! I'm sorry, this isn't even the right thread for all this. I need to get my butt over to the bitching thread, if I knew how to transfer this there I would. OK, so, like so many of you have said, deep breath! I have my appt with the surgeon to get my ovaries out in early May. I'll take this time to start investigating my mast/recon options. Thanks for the great advice everyone.",

I'm not good with links, but if you google \"craig's list cancer rant\" you should see a woman's description of chemo/dealing with cancer. She didn't have bc, so didn't have to deal with the breast issues, but chemo is pretty much chemo. I will warn you - she doesn't sugar coat it, and if anything, it's a list of what NOT to do/say to someone going through chemo. Having lived through chemo myself, I can tell you that it really hit home for me. I'm so sorry you and your wife had to join this club, and I wish you the best.",

The medical community doesn't do a lot of research for it, because it's too rare (i.e., the pharmaceutical cos won't make $$ on a cure because not enough kids get this type of cancer.) So they organized a cookie sale to raise $250,000 (I think, I forget the exact amount.) And they did it. Two moms, just 2 regular old moms, raised a quarter of a million dollars so they could pay someone to do research. Seriously, women rock! (OK, I might be slightly biased...) :-)",

My onc dismissed it with a \"you don't get mets there\", which I know is bad and wrong, but sometimes, you just want to believe them you know? I will admit it I sometimes worry that it's a bone met that I'm letting \"run rampant\", but mostly I just try to ignore it. Again, it's not 24/7, and it's not enough to make me limp. It's more like something I notice, and I consistently notice it in the same spot. I did have a terrible reaction to the taxol, and had lingering pain/numbness/etc from it for a LONG time. I generally chalk it up to that. As always, if it's more stressful not to get it checked, then make a phone call and ask for a scan. In my experience, if you say, \"I've had a consistent pain for more than 2 weeks that is bothering me enough that I need to take advil\" you will get a scan no questions asked.

I agree Beth, I very much feel like my breast surgeon was hell bent on getting this cancer out of me, and didn't think about much of anything else. (A year later I saw that the mamm and US reports both basically said it was a malignancy, apparently everyone knew it was cancer but me!) Rightly so on the one hand, that's her job. But it's like she didn't consider ANYTHING else. Even without the BRCA2, having bc at age 41 puts me at a very high risk for recurrence or another primary in my, hopefully long, lifetime. I know she felt like she was doing me a favor by preserving my boob, but I feel like she messed me up for the long-term you know? There are so many \"no one ever told me\" or \"they pooh-poohed me\" situations. I asked about the risk of lymphedema and was pooh-poohed. Yep, have it. I was told that lumpectomy + rads = mastectomy, but no one ever told me that the radiation would increase the risk of LE, and impact my ability for reconstruction. I always go back to the fact that I was SOOO stupid or freaked out or whatever that I never said, \"hey, how come I'm not having a biopsy again?\" The surgeon told me I didn't need a biopsy, because cancer or not, they would always surgically remove this type of lump. I have no idea if that's true or not, but it seems questionable. Beth, the site is great, thanks for the link. I know I probably seem negative, but I am the QUEEN of things going wrong, bad side effects, etc. I just don't have good luck with things like that to begin with, so I feel like I'm starting out with 2 strikes against me - my own bad luck and the radiation - when it comes to considering prohp mast w/reconstruction. And I'm single, and 44, and having all those feelings of \"who would ever want me?\" Oh my goodness! I'm doing it again. Sorry! This was meant to be a \"thanks guys, you're fantastic\" post, not throw myself another pity party. I'm just tired I think (literally and figuratively!)

(Dr Robert Osteen) He told me that the necessity for a full AND with micromets to the sent node was being closely looked at by the med community (particularly if you were doing chemo.) Basically, they were looking into whether the full AND is \"worth it\" in that situation. He told me that at that time (June 2005) he would recommend having the AND, but that he wouldn't be surprised if that recommendation changed in the next 5-10 years. I agree with the ladies above. You did what was right for you at the time, and there is no use in second guessing yourself. Best of luck to you.",

Yes, I was like a weeble, falling over, listing to the side, I made the very bad choice of wearing clogs to my 3rd taxol infusion (don't ask me what I was thinking, clearly I wasn't!) and almost wiped out my IV stand. While I think I was unusual, I had a really hard time with the taxol. Terrible bone pain, numb up to my knees and elbows, lost my nails, etc. I was really freaked out about it, and worried it would be permanent. While it did take quite a while, and I have some lingering (barely noticeable) side effects (fingertips ever so slightly numb, toe tips numb, pins and needles/burning sensation of bottom of feet), for the most part I am totally back to normal. I did do the L-Glutamine powder like a maniac, and if you are having side effects I would recommend it. I was REALLY expensive, but I wish I had known about it from the very beginning, as I didn't start it until after my second infusion, but I do think it helped. My onc recommended it to me, and I bought it at GNC. I forget how much I used, but I'm sure someone here will remember (or you could do a search for it or taxol and it will probably come up.)

Of course, follow all the good advice you've already gotten. But after the crazy trauma of my child's delivery (long story, but involved a lot of needles!) and then of course the bc surgeries and chemo, I have learned the following along the way: 1. The anesthesiologist almost always ended up being paged when they were trying to get my IV in. I finally learned to just calmly request the anesthesiologist insert it to begin with. 2. When their response to the request is, \"well, it will take longer, you will have to wait, etc. etc.\", merely smile sweetly. It's not like you had anything else planned for that particular moment. 3. Request a pediatric IV needle. They usually had more success with this for my pathetic little veins. 4. Find a nurse who is sympathetic, listens to you and is just you know, normal. Make her your ally. The nurses got me through both my weeks stay in the hospital after having my son and my cancer (not to mention the terrible experience with my mom, in which we had to end up taking her off life support.) Nurses rule! And yes, I'm much better about needles now. But if I get someone who won't listen to my requests or explanation that I have tough veins, I tell them the following, \"I'll give you one stick. If you don't get it in one stick, I'm going to have to ask you to honor my wishes.\" Sometimes that scares them into not even trying if they're not REALLY sure of their skills! Best of luck to you! I hope you get the biopsy done and it turns out that they were wrong and you are just fine. But if not, you will make it through. I promise.",

I am trying to look at it from the perspective of a piece of information I can use to make decisions, but honestly, it has really impacted me emotionally. I guess what I'm trying to say is that it might really impact your aunt emotionally. Is she the type of person who would realize that, and that's why she doesn't want to do the test? You're in a really tough spot. If it was me, I wouldn't want my aunt to feel like saying no to the test was impacting me or my treatment, but that's really the only way to explain why you are asking her again to get tested. Being Irish, I always think of the worst possible scenario, and think about whether or not I can live with it. So, I guess the worst scenario is your aunt does the test and finds she's BRCA pos. This allows you to breathe a tiny sigh of relief, but leaves her with this worry hanging over her head that she prefered to be ignorant of. The up side of that of course, is that she has useful information, but that is cold comfort if you know what I mean. On the other hand, you never know unless you ask, and your aunt my be more than willing to do the test now knowing that it would help you, and the family. I'm sorry you're in this stressful position, it's a lot ot have hanging over your head. Sorry I can't be of help on how to bring it up with relatives. My situation is different, I had to inform them that I was pos for the gene (I'm the first in my extended family to have the test done, at least as far as I know.) Best of luck to you!",

If you weren't, you wouldn't be worrying about the impact on your aunt or how to ask her. I was trying to convey that despite having already had bc (what I thought was \"the worst that could happen\"), the BRCA pos result was in some ways much more emotionally debilitating for me than I expected. I completely understand your position, and I know that logically, you are right about having the information to make an informed decision. (And I am moving forward to that end, had my ooph this summer, and am having consults about the PBM and recon options this fall.) To me, it sounds like in your heart, you know you need to ask your aunt again, and explain the benefits.I think you need to follow your heart. It sounds like you have a good enough relationship that if for some reason she just can't do it, you will understand, and she knows that. And I hope you believe that never for one instant did I think you were being selfish, or not thinking about your aunt and her feelings. Clearly, you would never have posted to begin with if you weren't worried about how to approach her, and the potential impact on her. That was the whole point of your post. I am having a really tough time right now about my status. Because of me my sister was tested, and she is also positive. I realize logically that this is not \"my fault\", but our relationship has been strained. As much as she is also realistic/rationale, it's not something she wanted to know about or deal with, and the whole thing has just been very hard on both of us. (Of course, I am TOTALLY pushing her to have the BLM. I don't want her to go through what I went through. Ever. I realize this makes no sense as I am the one that is a single parent, and have not moved forward with the BPM myself. Unfortunately, there are insurance issues involved for me, but that's another whole story in itself!) Anyway, I very much appreciate your kind words to me. I really am trying to get through all this as best I can. It says a lot about you that you would take the time to wish me well as you are trying to deal with such a sticky issue. I also wish you the very best. What I really wish for is that wand the doctors on Star Trek had, where they just wave it over you and can tell what's wrong with you, and more importantly, how to fix it. I know tone is hard to convey in writing, please know that my tone is heartfelt and sincere thanks and good wishes to you. Colleen",

And yes, BIRADS 5 is not good, but you won't know for sure until you get the biopsy results. It took me having cancer to learn this, and I know how hard it is, but try your best not to drive yourself too crazy in the meantime. A wise friend once said to me, \"whatever it is, it already IS, and no amount of worrying will change it.\" Cold comfort I know, but for some reason it helped me. IF you do have cancer (and I am hoping and praying that you do not), but IF you do, you will need to meet with: - a breast surgeon - to determine what your surgical options are (e.g., lumpectomy, mastecomy) - a plastic surgeon - to determine what your reconstruction options are if that's what YOU want - an oncologist - to determine if chemo is a requirement or an option - a radiation oncologist - to determine if radiation is a requirement or an option I know that sounds overwhelming, but you need to take your time and educate yourself before taking action. Again, I'm really hoping that you don't need to do any of this. But IF you do, you can come here and ask a million and one questions, and the wonderful ladies here will get you through every step. Of that, I am sure.",

First, I will tell you that there is an excellent web site called Facing Our Risk. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to put in a link to a website here, but if you google it, it will come up. It has extensive information on the BRCA gene mutation. You say you became your family's history. Does that mean there is no other history of breast cancer in the family? I ask because for me, it took a family history of breast cancer, plus my triple neg dx at age 41, to \"qualify\" for the genetic testing. Your daughter has had a double mast, that means she has in fact greatly reduced her risk of breast cancer. If you were to test postive for a BRCA gene mutation, your daughter could be tested as well. The only additional thing she could do would be to have her ovaries and fallopian tubes out, as there is a slightly higher risk of ovarian cancer associated with the BRCA gene. Clearly, this would be a big decision for a woman her age. There are other women on this board that are far more knowledgeable than I am about these things (Tender comes to mind), but you could certainly ask to speak with the genetic counselor to determine your risk level, and whether or not they recommend testing for you. The test if very expensive, and needs pre-approval from your insurance company. An appt to discuss the test is not though, and it sounds like it would give you some peace of mind. You are coming up on your three year mark! Congratulations on that, it is a huge milestone.",
