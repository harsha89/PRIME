I really want to listen.  Listen to you cry.  Listen to you be angry.  Listen to you learning to deal with what is happening to your body.  Help you adjust, tweek and tweek again your emotions till you find your new normal, both physically and emotionally.  You will get there.  And I am going to be there aaaallllll along the way.\" So what do you think?  Is it ok to say all that?  Is it ok to say \"You will get there\" even tho I don't have a medical degree?  I firmly believe she will.  Thanks in advance for any help and suggestions you give.",
