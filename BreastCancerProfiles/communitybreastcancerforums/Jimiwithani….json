The oncologist told me last week I was in between grade 2-3 which surprised me and she said she was fairly sure I would need to have chemo prior to surgery and when I did surgery she would most likely have them remove my ovaries. I guess I'll know more after I get the rest of my results. Thanks so much",

Per my surgeon, I'm to get the rest of the results tomorrow including results from a Lymph node core biopsy (he did on the day he told me of the cancer) from the oncologist. In his doctors notes, he said I'm to see her for \"neoadjuvant treatment\". I googled and it means chemo prior to surgery. I won't know for certain but I'm guessing that this may have gone beyond my breast. Also, I\"m scheduled for an MRI tomorrow afternoon and then meet back with the surgeon next Monday. Those things you mentioned help - I've printed an will ask. This is a lot to learn in a short amount of time. Will she be doing an examination of my breast?",

ElaineTherese - errgh...My breast and under arm are super sore and bruised from the biopsies...I guess I'm going to have to start wearing my big girl panties and deal with it. Good points on the chemo drugs. I've read a bit about the cold caps and that is something I can let go...hair loss will definately not be a highlight for me but i don't think I want to add one more thing to have to deal with in hope to keep hair that my still fall out all or some. Its all so overwhelming - so I may change my mind. I'm sure after tomorrow I'll know more and be in a better place to make decisions. Thanks again for answering my post.",

If positive port catheter, chemo, hormone therapy, surgery and radiation. This weekend I found a new pea-size lump in my nipple area. Saw surgeon today and he said he was pretty sure this was part of the cancer area (in addition to tumor MRI showed a large region leading to nipple as enhanced). Surgeon said that he would be taking 1/3 to 1/2 my breast plus my nipple area. I have DD Size breasts but that still a lot of breasT. I\u2019ve not decided to go with a bilateral mastectomy instead of lump Note. The first few visits my surgeon was talking a lot about breast conservative when I told him I thought I wanted to go ahead with mastectomy he said that\u2019s a good choice. I emailed my onocologist to get her input but I\u2019m guess the surgeon decides how much to take. My husband is worried I\u2019m mov8ng to fast. I\u2019m confused and would rather do the lumpectomy but if he taking that much I at least want the good percentages and increase my odds with it All thoughts are appreciated in advance.

If you can't help with my post leave a comment letting me know this at least made you smile! Here's the post...... My HER2 came back equivocal so they sent off for FISH. MRI showed in addition to tumor a diffuse non mass enhancement throughout the upper area of my breast over the my tumor extending to my nipple base measuring 12cm x 5.7. My surgeon said it may or may not be cance4 but they would check when surgery was done I'm waiting on HER2 for treatment plan. I know I will either be having port placement or surgery on August 1st depending on HER2 results. This morning I felt a hard garden pea size lump in my nipple area that wasn't there before. Should I call the surgeon or the oncologist? Has this happened to anyone else? It isn't near my tumor lump.
