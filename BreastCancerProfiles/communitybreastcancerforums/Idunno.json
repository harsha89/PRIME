I think I just had a rough morning. And to dogsandjogs: I have to figure out where I will be living and get settled more before I would get a dog. I work full time and I am involved in a group for young adults with disabilities. It is a place for them to get out of the house and meet others and feel loved. How ironic that I can run a group like that...and years later feeling like I need to be IN it and not running it. And I only mentioned the knee because I struggle with even seeing a doctor since that all happened. I have too much nerve damage to run. That leg is now deformed and nothing more can be done...the damage was done. The cyst was not dangerous...but not getting it removed in time turned out to be a problem with nerve damage which affects the ability to use the muscles on that leg. My legs don't match each other at all.  I don't want to get off topic with my knee and I apologize for typing about the knee. Really, I think now it was my way of saying...I really distrust doctors and I am terrified of them and this is the reason why I am afraid of them. So I think I am so afraid of any kind of doctor since the knee thing. I am over that chapter though it has changed me forever...and it was just background information to say...I don' t like or trust doctors. And then I got a doctor that was so angry yesterday. I really do get out there in life...I work fulltime with children with disabilities and the adults with disabilities in the evening. I am the strong one.. I thought. I am not so strong right now though. I think I am learning I have been a support to so many people...but don't really have a support system myself. I think I got too busy. I just really feel alone in this...probably my fault too. I hated seeing my friend cry...and why would I tell anyone else and worry them too. I did tell 2 others last evening...all it does is worry them. And I think I will be just fine. I just had a time of fear...not so much now. And I don't feel like I want to talk to anyone I know personally.  I would just have to be brave with them...my fault too that I always want to be the strong one.  I think it just felt good to be able to vent in my weakness...rather than be the one that assures and gives comfort. I may not be a mom or even a wife anymore (married for 27 years). But I have a lot of people that I love that depend on me...and I don't really have a place in my life to be weak. Maybe that is all I needed this morning...and may need it again. I hope I don't need the support from this group in the future. I really think it is a cyst...but my friend that cried also made me be more afraid. But that puts more pressure to be strong.  So I am so glad that there is this place for people to go to if they need to vent or need reassurance. In such a short time, I have had so many bad things happen...that even the thought of anything else just feels so heavy. So I really do appreciate the responses I got. Thanks again!",

I really mean that. And the most beautiful part about what you wrote...is the friend that cried and left...came back last night and just sat with me and held me. I would wipe away her tears and laugh at her when tears of her fear would come. I kept telling her...God has too much for me to do....I'll be around wheelchair racing people when I am 80 years old. We both laughed as we talked about how bad we will be when we are very old. But I thought of you last night and how touched I was...and that it came true...not with me and you...but with my best friend. Thank you so much...I wish I could have warped you into my house to be with us last night. Lilly55: I will try to be kind to myself. I am hard on me and I drive myself pretty good. Though I must say...I have the most beautiful people to love. But ...not so nice to myself if I am feeling sick.  I will try: )  Good news...feeling stronger today. Thinking I will be back at work tomorrow to see my babies!! : ) Wren44: Thanks for giving me a heads up on what may happen after a mammogram! Thanks for helping me feel okay about venting in this place! Bessie: So sorry that you went through a similar situation. It is tough to lose the love of your life. He would have taken such good care of me in all of this. I smile as I think of how he would be asking if I needed anything. He was such a love!! He would have been way more of a mess than anyone about this. I go on in life loving hard. I decided that all that love that I gave to him was still in my heart somewhere. So I turned up my heart for others and use that love to give to others now. He would be proud of that. Thanks for listening and sharing. AZ85048: That was so sweet! I reread the \"just try to get rid of us\" part several times. I loved that part. Haven't healed enough to worry others will just leave too. That felt so good to my heart. Hortense: Yes...that is how I moved forward....keeping love alive. I think it is my way of keeping Denny's love alive and not wasting the rest of my life. Way too little love in this big old world. And how blessed was I to have been loved so deeply for 27 years. He just took such good care of me so I could always be so free to help others that were not loved. And he was a partner in all of that...he still is! Ariom: I sending a hug right back at you! Thank you everyone that posted. If I could describe myself to anyone...I would say I love and I love hard and fast. I was deeply touched that you would all take time to write when I got scared yesterday. Today I am feeling stronger than yesterday. Will be excited to go to work tomorrow. And still think it is just a cyst. But what a beautiful place to go if someone needs to...it is beautiful because so many take time to just post. And each post meant a lot. I still won't tell anyone else that I know personally because I really don't want anyone to worry without a reason. But I am grateful that when I was feeling weak this place was here. And if I have any more weak times...I know where I will come. I don't write this next sentence to offend non Christians...so please forgive me if I do...its not my intent. But I will be saying some special prayers for all of you. My mammogram is January 20 and I will let you all know the size of my benign cyst : )  And thank you so much again. You are a special group of women to take timeout for someone like me...not even diagnosed with anything but hitting a spell of worry! Thanks for being there!",

      "Content": "Idunno wrote: I am not sure what to say. So much in my life. 1.5 years ago, my husband was laughing, kissed me good bye, said I love you and died at work an hour later. There was no warning...we were making plans for the weekend. We had no children...not by choice...we couldn't. When I noticed a lump a little over a month ago...I was quite okay with that. I wasn't worried at all. I googled lump in breast...and read something about a cyst. Didn't think anything more of it...I was too busy trying to survive.  Yesterday I went to the doctor since it was the third time in less than a year that I have felt so weak I could barely move. I missed 2 days of work last week. I was so cold yet no fever. A friend came over and I was under several blankets and had several jackets on. She was holding me and even after several hours....I was still cold and she kept saying how cold I felt. The next day I became soaking wet with sweat...tho I was not hot and I was cold. I am not a hypochondriac. Because my husband died recently...I think doctors thought I was. I had terrible knee pain that was crippling. It took 4 doctors to find out what was wrong. The others just dismissed it. I had a hole in my tibia and it was filled with debris. I had a large cyst that was pressing on my nerves. But it took 4 doctors to hear me since it was only a month after my husband died that I got severe pain in my knee. I know it seems off topic to put the above information...but I am hoping that you will read that and know one thing. I am so tired of a fight. I worry that again...doctors will think I am just making it up. I don't know how much more of a fight I have left. Many friends have gone. My problems mounted after my husband died and I think they feel so overwhelmed that they have fallen away. Am in the process of losing my house. Please...if you read this far...don't leave me too. Even though you are a stranger...I need someone...and I am so very alone. I went to the doctor yesterday about the other symptoms I have written above...cold, tired, muscle fatigue. And I thought...since I am here...I will tell the doctor about the lump in my breast. She felt my breast and very angrily told me that it was 6 to 9 centimeters on left breast. She felt the other breast and in a gruff voice told me I had small granular feeling things along the side of the wall on right side (don't even know where that is)...which I can't feel at all. She said I needed a diagnostic mammogram and bloodwork. She left the room and I never saw her again. The nurse scheduled a diagnostic mammogram and I had the blood work done yesterday. My friend that was with me at this visit, cried on the way to drive me home...and then left. She didn't stay with me at all. She hurried and went home. So I have been alone with all this since yesterday morning. No one to talk to. I decided to type in breast cancer lump..and see what that said yesterday. I had no idea that a sometimes there are symptoms...like a rash on a breast or inverted nipples. I had both for over a year. But those things went away. Only on occasion do I have an inverted nipple...and the rash that took over a year to go away...hasn't been there for almost a year. I read through posts...but haven't come across anyone that said they had a rash that was red and peeling. I haven't read anyone that talked about the hindsight problems such as prior to feeling a lump they had a large rash on the breast. Though I am very convinced that it is only a cyst...I am now thinking of other possibilities.  And the saddest thing is the lonliness. I don't know what I am looking for in this....maybe just to know there is someone out there and I am not alone. I feel ashamed because the doctor was so mad sounding...and I don't know how to make sense of that either. I am fighting hard to not feel bad but she seemed so angry with me.  I know for sure...I would love to hear from anyone that when they looked back several years before a lump...did they have any strange rash or other symptoms. I remember one day when my nipples inverted. I was too embarrassed and hid it from my husband. After reading yesterday...I found out that could be a warning sign. Who would have known?!  But today...I think...they do not always invert...so they just do off and on for the last 2 years.  Did anyone else have a doctor that was mean about it? Just feeling alone and sad and confused. Seems hard to go through anything else right now. And I have never been so alone. Any comments would be appreciated. Log in to post a reply",
