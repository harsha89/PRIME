I had no breast differences at all besides the lump of course.  I do feel another lump behind my nipple but deep in the tissue  that I dont feel on the other breast. I also feel lots of lumps of a softer veriety on the top outer part of my breast . ohhhh how bout this imagine your saying the plege  and your putting your hand over your heart. Well where your fingers end is where i feel the marble size lumps but again they are soft.  my areola lump is definately a lump. Its not soft and when I squeeze the lump i have dichage from the nipple. When i squeeze the nipple there is no dicharge just when I squeeze the lump. the discharge has never been green but has been a variety of other colors which makes it harder to google.",

I have a lump in my breast which I have had for about 2 years a half inch below the nipple under the skin of the areola. This has been biopsied before and determined to be inflamation with acute and chronic fibrosis.  No mri ever done and also no mammagram. That was back in march.  After that I was squeezing the lump and fluid shot out of the skin of my areola. I called my pcp who put me on antibiotics. They did not work so I called her and told her. She refered my back to the general surgeon who did the biopsy. Well my insurance got cancelled in the process before I could get to the appt. The spot on the areola healed within a couple days of the popping but the hard lump remained. So here we are in August and I have nippled discharge daily. Only if I squeeze the lump tho. I dont squeeze the nipple but if I squeeze the lump fluid comes from 2 ducts in my nipple. The colors range. First thing in the morning if I squeeze it it is like a non clear yellowish dischage. But through out the day if I squeeze it it is a clear amberish dischage and there have been times that I squeeze it and it is a pinkish non clear dischage. Mostly the amberish discharge tho.  When it is the non clear yellowish dischage it has an odor. otherwise no odor. The lump Does not shrink tho. The tip of the nipple is inverted no but not the whole nipple. You can def tell a difference between the two nipples.  Never have a fever or any pain in the breast. Just recently about a dime size part of the skin beside the lump (still on the areola) has turned brown and dry and has a couple of cracks going through it. I know I should prob pay up the money to see the doc again but wanted to know if anyone else has had these symptoms and what caused them.   Log in to post a reply",
