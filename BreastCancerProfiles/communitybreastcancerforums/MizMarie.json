My platelets were up significantly, so it was a \"GO\" for the poison today.  Downside was that my hemoglobin continues to slip, even with the extra week and all the iron I ingest plus two transfusions in the span of six weeks.  MO is going to try to get my insurance to pay for Aranesp to counteract the anemia.  Anybody have experience with this?",

I'm scheduled for my last chemo on Thursday, and hoping and praying that it actually happens.  My platelet count was not very high last time, and I doubt that it has rebounded yet.  I have a few purple dots on my arms and my gums have been bleeding a little lately; both are indicators of low platelet levels.  Onc doesn't want to do labs until the day of treatment, so I'll have to wait until then to know if it's a \"go\".  I'll get Herceptin regardless, but still, I am so tired of Chemo and just want it to be OVER!  ",

Oh, and if you put your Boost or Ensure in the freezer until it is slushy and then sip it through a straw, it is way easier to get down.  Good luck!",
