The crutch impacted my left breast and it instantly grew, got hard and turned 3 shades of purple. Went to the hospital, they didn't do anything. 3 days later I'm at the breast surgeon's office, getting cut open and he squeezed my breast for 15 angonizing minutes while my husband stood there and watched. I've never endured anything so aggresive in my entire life. 200 cc's of blood was taken out of the lump that was the size of a softball. My breast turned black from all the blood pooling inside. I was still black and blue 6 months later. Then I had an ultrasound guided biopsy just to make sure. It was negative. Now, 1 year later, I have 2 scars, a lavender colored breast and lots of pain. I'm going to see another surgeon tomorrow because I refuse to see the other one. I was told by my Dr. that she's pretty sure it's scar tissue. We will see I guess. Oh and I can't wait for the day when I can wear a bra again! So to answer your question, YES scar tissue is painful.",
