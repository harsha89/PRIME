    "Content": "determinedljp wrote: My mom is taking chemo once a week for 3 weeks. The day after the 3rd treatment she gets a neulasta shot. Then she has a week off before the cycle starts again. For 3 months in a row she has developed a fever of up to 103 approximately 7 days after the neulasta shot. She has been hospitalized each time. They have done all kinds of cultures, xrays, etc and have found nothing. They have put her on an antibiotic cocktail and her fever slowly subsides over about a week from when it started. Has anyone else experienced this after neulasta? Log in to post a reply",
