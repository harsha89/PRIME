YAY!!!  For me , it's 2 down 6 to go!  Thank you for the eyebrow \"heads-up\"!  Sounds like I should have them until Taxol and lose them shortly thereafter.  But they are already starting to thin out....with the bald head I kind of look like Casper the Friendly Ghost!  I will definitely check out the Anastasia products.... OXOXOXO to all! Kathy :O)",
