Hoping they find your lump benign. ",

And, it takes some time to figure out what is going on, which is needed to understand what treatments are needed. The best things you can do at this point is to educate yourself--not on Dr. Google; the articles on bco are fantastic and will teach you about breast cancer, how diagnosis works, what to expect with surgery, treatment, and so on. That way, as your dr. talks to you, you will be familiar with terms, etc. It is a lot to absorb, but you will get there. And you are not alone--there is a lot of support here.

I met w/my MO, who recommended no chemo.  As Annice (and others? have shared), she said chemo would only reduce recurrence chance 2-3%, and risks outweigh any benefit.  She said one of the benefits that chemo would have on me (pre-menopausal) is chemopause--stopping my periods, so instead she started me on Zoladex (monthly shot in my belly), which will shut down my ovaries (=stop producing estrogen).  In addition, I will start Tamoxifen next month--be on that for 5 years, and then on an AI 5 years after that.  She also will put me on Zometa (every three months), which helps with bone density, and studies are showing that there's additional benefit to reducing recurrence. When I asked my MO about longer term, where will I be with all of this, she was optimistic.  On top of me being statistically in good shape, she said I'd be on these estrogen suppressing treatments for the next 10 years (starving any cancer trying to get a foothold) and 10 years from now we'll have that much more information about BC treatments. ",
