About 6-7 years later, I discovered another lump but this time, it was in my left breast. Subsequently, I've noticed 3 more plus a newly formed one in the right breast. I've been delaying getting them checked out because I've just kept assuming that they were all fibroadenomas and harmless. Your post has made me realise that I need to make a doctor's appointment asap. So thank you! I hope everything works out for you. ",
