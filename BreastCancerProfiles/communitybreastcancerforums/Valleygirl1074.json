    "Content": "Valleygirl1074 wrote: I was diagnosed with breast cancer on April 8th. I\u2019m having a double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery on May 8th. I really want a recliner to sleep in because I hate sleeping on my back. However I don\u2019t want to buy one because we have nowhere for it long term. I\u2019m just thinking I would like to use one for the first few weeks to sleep in and that it would be a lot easier on me. does anyone know of any organizations in Houston Texas that help women and loan out recliners or rent them?
