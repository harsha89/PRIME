They were surprised that I was not referred within 2 weeks after initial surgery! Had DX on July 1 for surgery September 16th after 2nd opinion... second surgery to clear margins sept 30th... Is that normal for them to delay so long to begin to set an appointment or even tell me that I had to call an oncoligist for an appointment.... The surgeon never set appt from beginning....was told I needed to call!",

With the swelling and seroma it is so difficult! I always sleep on my right side due to other physical problems. Now trying to prop my arm up and not roll over on that side is so difficult! not to say how numb your arm gets hanging it up above you! Any other suggestions?",
