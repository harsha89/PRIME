The good news is that you have time to learn more about LCIS and thoroughly consider your options. As with most things in life, our initial reactions are typically quite emotional, and sometimes having a little time to let those emotions settle gives us the chance to make the decision that is truly best for you. I was diagnosed with LCIS in February and wanted to BMX right away. My responsible BS advised me to wait and gather all information before taking that step. In the meantime, I had the excisional biopsy to make sure the LCIS wasn't adjacent to any invasive cancer. I saw an oncologist and had my mother do genetic testing (her mother passed from breast cancer in her 40s). I let the emotions settle, I read more medical resources, I searched the boards here to learn more about others' experiences, and I enjoyed the summer with my kids. After several months, I had the clarity that the BMX was the right way to go for me, and I am thankful I took the time to come to that decision rather than going for it right away and possibly regretting it. I don't have any regrets. You aren't crazy with your emotions, and our gut feel is always strong. This decision is yours for your body, but give it time as it's not reversible. However, likening a prophylactic BMX because of LCIS to amputating your legs is extreme and doesn't fully appreciate your diagnosis and its effect on your life.",

Pinkvictory, your posts are always so comforting and well said :) Lsunshine, I brought toothpaste and toothbrush, my face soap, my phone, and my iPad with some shoes downloaded from Netflix. Some friends sent in magazines, which was great because I didn't feel like reading a book but didn't always want to watch tv. I also brought a couple pairs of underwear. I never put pants on because I have compression stockings and sleeves around my calves to keep blood flowing and avoid clots. Make sure you get up and walk around a few times a day, it makes you feel more human and gets everything moving. Kmb4, that is a great idea to go to the beauty salon to get hair washed.

We've been through quite a lot, and perhaps those two days in bed with pain were just enough to push you over your emotional limit. Focus on what's behind you, what you've already accomplished, and then just take it day by day. I'm in the same boat with you and the drains (I think our surgery was one day apart), and it really sucks to think about having them over the long weekend. I have to be at 20ml or less for 3 days to get them out, and the one on my right is only down to 25ml, and I just made it to 20ml on left yesterday. I literally sat on my butt all day yesterday to get to that point, and I don't plan to do much at all this weekend so that I can get the fluids down to where they need to be; there is no way I am risking having to keep these things in any longer than Tuesday. I originally had 4 and now 2; when they took the first two out, it wasn't painful, but it was uncomfortable. The nurse had me do a giant breath in and then took them out during the long exhale - they were done by the time I couldn't breathe out anymore. It was worth the discomfort!",

There is a dent around the top of my right implant (I have pre-pec implants) that I would like to have filled, and if there is any more fat, then the cleavage could use a little too. It's nice to finally be able to wear more of my clothes and not feel like I have torpedos on my chest. I had small, sad, 41 year old, nursed three kids boobs before having them removed, so I am very happy that the foobs are a big improvement over what I had before! The fat donor site was very sore for a couple of weeks after the procedure, but now it's fine, and there was numbness that is going away gradually. Now I am going to myofascial release therapy to work out the scar tissue that has formed at the donor site. kmb, I hear ya on nipple recon...while I was able to keep mine, they don't project much at all, and I had some necrosis on the right side, but I told my PS I really didn't need her to make them any more prominent! Being able to go braless sometimes will be really nice, especially in summer. Thinking of you all during your treatments, and I hope the side effects have been manageable. I recently found out my best friend's sister has breast cancer (2 inch IDC tumor) and is about to go through mastectomies. She found out today she is BRCA2+, and my friend will have testing done ASAP. If anything positive has come from my experience, I am happy to be able to share my knowledge (a lot gained on this site) with her and her sister as they navigate everything.",

She said both options are perfectly acceptable for me and that it's a personal decision. I've been able to put it out of my mind since I had an excisional biopsy in May to confirm only LCIS at original needle biopsy site and no invasive cancer or DCIS, but now that I am about a month out, I'm starting to let myself prepare mentally.

I am so impressed by how strong you all are, and it warms my heart to see everyone progressing along their paths. Thank you for sharing your experiences. I am not until Aug. 24 for BMX and had my pre-op last week with the plastic surgeon. I was a tad overwhelmed by all the info and prescriptions, but her office is wonderful, and they do a great job of hand holding throughout the whole process. rljessu, my PS gave me a prescription for a surgical camisole and told me where to go to buy it. One is like a camisole that zips up the front and has two pockets on the inside to hold the drains. The other is similar but shorter and no pockets, for after the drains are removed. She wrote down the style names, and I can go through the paperwork to look them up for you if you'd like. Lsunshine, we are on very similar journeys. I, too, have LCIS, so my BMX is prophylactic. I, too, wonder if I am doing the right thing or going too extreme. I, too, can't imagine living my life in 6 month intervals of monitoring, possible additional biopsies, stress, and Tamoxifin. I feel selfish saying that when so many other women have no choice and are dealing with worse medical circumstances. I saw an oncologist in June, and she was the first doctor who would give me an estimate of my chances of developing invasive breast cancer. For me, although I have a family history of my maternal grandmother passing away in her 40s from BC, my mother's genetic testing was negative, and I am negative for BRCA1 and BRCA2. The oncologist said my risk is dominated by the LCIS, and is estimated to be between 36 and 48%. But that's just an estimate...no one knows who will actually end up with BC and who the lucky ones are. She made me feel at ease in telling me that both options - monitoring or BMX - are perfectly acceptable options for me. My BS was urging monitoring because it's the least invasive approach with the best statistical outcome. However, my daughter had a stroke in-utero, and the chances of that happening were one in a few thousand...so tell me I could have 48% chance of getting BC, and the girls are coming off! We can do this!",

I had a bit of a roller coaster of emotions after exchange too - thinking that I wished the implants were bigger. I, too, was small before all of this and was looking forward to being bigger. I think we get used to the expander size, which for me was, in hindsight, too big, but right after exchange I was disappointed because I wanted the implants to be as big as the expanders. HOWEVER, let your body heal and swelling to go down, which takes a lot longer than you'd think. I had a lot of swelling in the sternum initially, and that made the implants look smaller (relative to my frame). Also, just like you got used to the expanders, you will get used to the implants. I am now three months after exchange and happy with the size. In fact, I wouldn't want them bigger - I want them to stay looking natural as I age. While they aren't huge, they are decent and at least fuller than my \"sad\" boobs I had before surgeries. I am actually going in for fat grafting tomorrow to add some softness around the implants...has your PS discussed fat grafting as a possibility for you down the road? That could add some fullness that you are looking for. I think it's hard too because our chest appearance until the exchange has been \"temporary,\" but now we face with what our boobs will actually look like and compare them to how we imagined them to look...that's a little tough to digest. Hang in there and see how things look with time.",

After 6 weeks, I finally can honestly say that I finally feel like myself following surgery and even have some periods during the day when I don't think about this. Going back to spinning classes (at a reduced intensity) has really helped mentally. I even slept on my side last night, and it was heaven! My expanders are fully inflated, so now it's just a waiting period until my exchange surgery in November, as long as no other complications arise. I will look forward to wearing more of my clothes after that...right now, I feel I am limited to looser clothing to hide my \"torpedos\" as I call them. I still have numbness under my right arm that extends around my back, and while I don't expect to get feeling back in my breasts, I am hoping to get some nerve regeneration in this area. It feels like I am shaving someone else's armpit. I've been thinking a lot about all you ladies who have progressed in your treatment, and I pray that each day brings you closer to completing your current goal. I have learned a lot from reading about your experiences, and please know you each have a cheerleader in virtual corner :)",

There's not as much activity on the LCIS boards, so it's nice to have a fellow one here. I'm curious if you know whether your surgeon will remove any lymph nodes for your surgery? Mine is leaning against it because the excisional biopsy showed only LCIS, but she's leaving the option open depending on what she sees during the procedure. I'm hoping she doesn't take any, but I of course want to her to do what is necessary for the best outcome. MommyErin, I hear ya on the snuggles and gym time! I'm not looking forward to the time period that I have to tell my little ones that mommy can't give normal hugs. As you can tell from my username, I really enjoy cycling (indoor)...it's my sanity, and I want to get as much in as I can before I have to take the time off. It will be hard for me not to exercise. I'm so sorry that cancer got to you first, but it sounds like you are putting up a strong fight!!! Beachmama, I hope you are able to relax and enjoy the peace of the sand and waves :) .

They are looking a lot better, so I think all will be ok in the end...trying to be positive. The right side is worse, and the center part has turned very dark - the PS said to expect it and that the top layer will eventually come off like a scab with healthy tissue underneath (might result in a flatter nipple, but I'm ok with that, mine were pretty flat to begin with). The area around it used to be dark purple, but it is now much lighter and smaller in size, so that gives me hope. I put on the nitro-bid cream three times a day, and I've been able to figure out the dosage so that the headaches are bearable. I had a surgical biopsy on the right side earlier in the year, and the incision was around the areola, so I'm speculating that the scar tissue in that area isn't helping the blood flow to the nipple. I, too, had some bleeding there in the past few days and, while it wasn't pleasant, I was thinking that it's a good sign that there is blood there. Will let you know how today goes.",

She also took off what I call Saran wrap on my breasts, and it felt like the best massage ever when she peeled it away. My drain sites were so itchy, and my skin was not happy with all the adhesive, so I can't wait to take a shower today to fully clean my abdomen. As for the nipples, she thinks the left is all good - just one small light purple spot that she says will go away. The right has superficial necrosis, and I will lose the top layer once the \"scab\" falls off, but the area around it is looking decent. Switching from nitro-bid (thank goodness, no more headaches) to polysporin to prevent infection while it heals. I will likely have a flatter right nipple, but I'm ok with that, and she said that they could do some things to rebuild it if I choose to do so. All in all, if that is the worst complication I have, I will take it. She also said I could raise my arms long enough to shave my underarms, so I am happy about that too. I am to keep taking it easy over the next week, which I've gotten used to surprisingly, so I was fine hearing that. beach2beach, I think that my PS would want me to not wear a bra, but I need something to keep the gauze/ointment in place over my nipple. My surgical camisole zips up, but PS said it would be too tight and might compromise blood flow to the nipple, so I can't zip it up fully, which is awkward, especially if I venture out into public and see people I know. She said I could wear a bra that is not tight, doesn't have underwire or padding, and zips up the front. I went to Target to look for one that fit the bill, but all zip or clip front bras had either padding or underwire, so I bought a $15 one that fits all criteria but hooks in the back, and my husband will help me put it on. I had to get a size much bigger than my normal size so that it wouldn't be compressive. Lsunshine, I'm glad to hear you are taking it day by day...I'm sorry you had the pain med issue in the hospital, not fun at all. Things will get better, just be patient. I felt like I've had two turning points...one around the first week mark when the tightness in the chest was less frequent and my drain output decreased at the same time. The second is now as I approach second week...I've been able to do a little more around the house that doesn't involve reaching. I feel like each week will bring a little more normalcy. That's good news about your pathology and no treatment needed...and my goodness, if there is positive news about finding the small ILC is further reassurance that you made the right choice for you in having the mastectomy. Best wishes! MrsWinnie - great news about nodes being clear! Woot woot!",

Mamabear80 - I would ask if she meant 1% survival or 1% recurrence; it's an important distinction. While I love and respect my BS, I found she often focused on the survival statistics and not other statistics that were just as important to me, like percent chance of getting invasive cancer (I am LCIS).

I am about to take my first shower when my husband gets home from work, and I am nervous to see my new foobs for the first time. Before the exchange surgery, I went to a physical therapist four times over two weeks to work on some scar tissue that formed on my right side. She would mechanically work away the scar tissue and also work on my chest muscle, which was really tight. The treatments really helped, and I noticed a big improvement in my range of motion on the right. Prior to treatment, if I tried to lift my right arm over my head, I would feel a strong pulling through my right chest muscle and armpit that would prevent me from making my right arm straight. Now it's symmetrical with my left. I just thought I would mention it in case anyone is having similar issues. Good to hear from everyone :)",

      "Content": "Feb 21, 2018 07:36PM cyclegal wrote: Hi Lsunshine, I had fat grafted from my back (flanks) with the exchange surgery in November, and this time (February), she used my outer thighs, inner knees, and abdomen for the donor sites. My main issue is that I don't have a lot of fat, so that's why she's had to go to so many different sites. After the first surgery, my back was incredibly sore...probably the most sore I've been after all of my surgeries. I think she was aggressive in trying to get enough fat so that we wouldn't have to do a follow-up fat grafting, but obviously that didn't happen. She made two small incisions along the center of my back for the first grafting. For the second grafting, she made the small incisions in strategic places that are well hidden - for the outer thighs, the incisions are located along the fold between my legs and butt, for the inner knees, they are along one of the folds just above the knee, and for the abdomen, they are below where a bikini bottom would sit. The second grafting was far less painful than the first because I think she was careful not to mess up the other parts of my body. I have almost no pain in the chest - a nice side of effect of not having feeling there anymore! Another comment on location - the person who does my myofascial release massage warned me against using inner thighs - she said that for some people, the healing can be funky there and leave the skin looking strange, and my PS agreed. I've read here that some people have no problems with that area however, so it might be different for different people. As far as care after the fat grafting, I was instructed to wear a compression garment 24/7 for the first three weeks and then for 12 hours a day for the next three weeks. My PS ordered Marena garments for me - you can also get them online on the Marena website or amazon. Mine have the opening for going to the bathroom, but I have been afraid to use it for fear of splashing and just pull it on and off each time, which is a pain but doable. If I was just doing my back or abdomen as a donor site, I would get one that is a high waisted panty with a snap crotch opening. After three weeks, I started going to myofascial release, which helped a ton with breaking up scar tissue that forms in the donor sites, and she also worked on some scar tissue that had formed near one of my mastectomy incisions. Ask you doctor about activity restrictions...mine were different first vs. second time because the first time also involved the exchange, but I am being overly cautious this time because I want to do everything I can to make sure a good amount of the fat stays. Be on top of doing what you need to do to get your digestive system moving after the surgery. The bloating from being stopped up is not enjoyable, and it's even less enjoyable when your abdomen is being compressed! I'm happy I chose to do a second fat grafting. I had the indentation at the top of the implants and pretty significant rippling on the sides (my implants are over the muscle) because my skin is pretty thin. While I know I have some swelling still, and it's only been two weeks since the surgery, but the overall appearance is softer and fuller, and the indentation is gone. Keeping my fingers crossed because, as long as nothing goes wrong, I'm done with surgery - being under 4 times in less than a year is enough for me! There is a good thread on the boards about fat grafting - let me know if you can't find it, and I will send you the link.",
