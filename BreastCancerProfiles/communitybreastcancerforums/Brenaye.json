Be proactive and learn as much as you can about cancer while waiting for diagnosis, but definitely try to get in sooner. What you learn now may have no bearing on what you end up being diagnosed with/not diagnosed with, but will still be valuable info to you or a loved one later on. To your question of whether you should prepare for the worst : I say absolutely not! Expect a wonderful verdict: \" it's not cancer.\" Go from there.I can't say I know what the waiting is like because my Dr. got me in right away when I described my symptoms and had mammograms and ultrasound next day. Seriously.But I can IMAGINE it is scary for you.Think positive and concentrate on your family. Cuz they love you and must expect many more years/decades ( centuries ?!? ) with you. Don't disappoint them. I hope that very soon you can post that you got great news from Dr !!!!!",
