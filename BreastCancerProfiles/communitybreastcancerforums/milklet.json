I've been careful with my left arm re: bp, blood draws, etc., but now I'm concerned with a feeling in my left arm that started 2 days ago. I can only describe it as an achy feeling from the elbow to the wrist, but only along the inside of the arm, and only when I physically touch it. There is no redness, and comparing both arms and hands, the left seems no more swollen than the right. It feels almost the same as an athletic injury/pulled tendon type thing -- except I've done nothing strenuous or athletic in the last few weeks. That being said, I have 5! recent bug bites on that lower left arm, which of course I have scratched -- but could that mean infection?? any help (or anyone with the same experience) is appreciated. thanks, rachel Log in to post a reply",
