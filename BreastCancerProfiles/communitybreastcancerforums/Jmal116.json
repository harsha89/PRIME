After finding a lump and being sent for mammograms, ultra sounds, MRI's and more ultrasounds..it was determined that I have a lot going on (multiple cysts, and even more fibroadenomas) in both breasts. All of which appear to be benign. Unfortunately on top of having 97% density, my mother has had 2 separate breast cancers one of which she was diagnosed with at 34. (3 years older than I am currently) With the findings, and my risk factors..my doctor and I determined that it was best to wait 6 months and reevaluate. I was getting married in a month so this worked great for me. Well now that my appointment is in 2 days, all of the worry and anxiety, and what ifs are picking up right where they left off. I guess there isn't so much a question to this post as much as just venting and putting it in writing to those who understand. Though I am curious if anyone has been diagnosed due to suspected benign abnormalities changing over the course of the 6 months? Log in to post a reply",
