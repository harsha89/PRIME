Do you have someone else that can be your confidant?  Someone you can call any time of the night?  There are plenty of folks here who are very caring and supportive, so post all you need to. And about that anger.  You should read some of the older posts on the forum.  You'll see that you can let it all hang out here.",

The recovery from my biopsies was easier than I had expected.  I was awake for the first biopsy.  They were going to go for several angles in my second biopsy so they made me go partially under.  Didn't need to stay in hospital overnight. Hope this helps.",
