It is hard to find a happy medium when everyone is so scared and stressed out. From the family member's persepctive, it is really hard to feel so helpless and its also hard to believe that something like this could happen to your parent. My mom and i are definitely seeking a second opinion, but since this doctor is at the second best cancer hospital, my mom is hesitant to go anywhere else. They don't let you switch doctors and she also wants to just get the cancer out and then figure things out from there depending on what they find. The only thing is now they have found another 0.8cm mass on second MRI (which my mom had in order to have a lumpectomy) that they now want to ultrasound and maybe biopsy. The woman keeps saying it may not be anything, but thats what they said the first time. It is all so scary. Now there could be two cancer sites. Does anyone know how this affects staging and prognosis? I assume this is not a good sign at all and am very worried. Now my mom is leaning towards a mastectomy as at least with this they can test the whole breast tissue and the tests wont miss anything else. None of the 4 mammos, 2 ultrasounds or first MRI picked up on this before. Does anyone know how common it is to have two sites of cancer? I feel like my mom is under attack and I am just so scared for her. What good are their mammograms and other tests if they just miss stuff? ",

It is so good to hear success stories and survivors. Im so glad to hear that you all are doing well. Thank you very much for your advice and comfort. It is just really hard because this has struck so out of the blue--no family history, no reproductive problems, no smoke/alcohol, no real reason to think that this could have happened to my mom. I just feel this dread because I don't understand how this could happen to my mom and I worry about the future because it just seems like we are not having any luck. Of all the problems, why and how this? My mom's parents and immediate relatives lived long into old age, passing from diseases of old age, not from cancer.  I have found out more about what my mom has. She has IDC 1.4 cm. They said it does not look like it has spread to lymph nodes (how could the radiologist know this?). The radiologist said they think my mom can wait 1wk 1/2 for appt. Consult with doctor is next wed. We have waiting all this week.  She also has ER+ /PR +, Her2-. What does this mean? What do most women with breast cancer have?  It is all so confusing and doesnt really make much sense. How does this affect my mom's odds? Im just so scared. Thank you all very much. ",

I don't know who any of you are, but I just wanted to say that you have so helped me and comforted me over the past few days. It is so hard not to be able to discuss my fears with anyone because I don't want to scare my mom. Your responses have been very helpful. I so appreciate your kindness and support. I've always known about breast cancer, but honestly thought it wouldn't be something that would ever affect my mom or something that we had to worry about. It is such a shock and so overwhelming and now I really understand how scary it truly is. My mom and I keep trying to be brave, but sometimes the fear is just overwhelming. I am just worried about lymph nodes and metastisis. Could it have already metastisized? I'm so scared to go this wed. for these tests. Everything about breast care seems wrong to me. No one ever told my mom that her breasts were especially dense and that mammos might not show everything. 2 yrs ago she had to have a diagnostic mammo for something suspicious and the radiologist wrote that it was fine on second mammo. It was the same breast that she now has cancer. I am so angry because maybe they missed it. She should have had a MRI back then. I just wish the doctor had told us about dense breasts.",

You all are angels and I can't tell u how much even this one post and your resposes have meant to us. We just returned from initial appt. At MSK and told mom has tentatively stage 1 unless lymph nodes are involved. Doctor said it is close to 2cm even though the ultra sound says 1.4. Not sure how this could be...she said something about possible swelling but did not indicate if the tumor is large because of that or actually 2cm.. She said my mom is candidate for lump. Or mast. But seemed to be pushing lump. We dont know what to do. Doctor said that lymph nodes don't feel inflamed. However, and I'm not sure if you have any advice, the doctor had the worst possible bedside manner imaginable. We had read this about her but never knew it could be this bad. She barely acknowledged we were people and was so clinical in her approach. She spent like 10 minutes talking in a flat tone of voice with limited eye contact with no ability for us to interject a question. When we finally tried to ask a question she says, why don't you let me finish.\" then she talks for another 10 minutes. We had prepared a list of questions and she told us to just pick a few. She really seemed to not want to answer any of our questions and we landed up not asking 3/4ths of them. She then left us in the room after shaking our hands and didn't have us do anything else. We had wanted to schedule the pre surgery tests but she told us she didn't know if we could do It today. At this point we don't know what to do. We don't need someone who is our best friend, but we would like someone who at least pretends to care and who shows at least a pea sized amount of compassion. We also have tons of questions. We dontknow what to do. We heard there is a patient advocate who can help you switch within the department but then the surgeon might find out and then what? I guess I'm just wondering what anyone thinks we should do?",

How are we supposed to know unless someone tells us. My mom is very small breasted so it didn't cross our mind. If only someone had said and she would have had an MRI two years ago. My mom can't even feel a lump (hers is 1.4 cm), neither could the doctors. The radiologist told my mom it is very small and very treatable but 1.4 cm is not that small at all. Is it? I wonder if the radiologist even knows what she is talking about. She is supposed to be top, but how could she tell us it is very treatable without even knowing if it has gone to the lymph nodes? Is it too tiny to go to lymph nodes yet? Im just so confused. It makes me worried because I am assuming my mom's lump is further in the breast and maybe closer to the chest wall. It is in the 7:00 position.  I am just so worried for Wednesday. All these fears that it may have already metastisized or gone to lymph nodes. Mammograms are supposed to help for early detection, but they don't even work for some women until the cancer is bigger.  My mom's gynecologist didn't feel it in May when she did physical exam.    Just what I have heard from you so far, you seem like a very strong woman and I am sure your chemo and radiotherapy will go smoothly and I will keep you in my thoughts. I hope we can all put this chapter in our lives behind us some day. I just hope my mom can have a chance to fight this and not get bad news on Wednesday. ",
