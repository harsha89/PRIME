I also found out from the insurance company that they will continue to pay for the premiums after I have collected the benefits.  I have to fill out what they call a waiver of payment of premiums.  Another plus! wayover20 - Can you elaborate on what you stated about your house will be paid off when you die?  You mentioned that because it is insured.  I'm asking because the first thing I want to do is pay off the mortgage, a few line of credits, one car, and purchase a home and put a huge downpayment on it.  This home will be a rental property so that my husband and my daughter will have that 'extra'  income for themselves (or for me too!).",

      "Content": "Apr 4, 2010 11:25PM - edited Apr 4, 2010 11:28PM by JennGrace I am so happy to read all the ladies that have benefited from my post - and I originally thought it was a stupid inquiry!  To give an update on everyone -- our house is paid off, along with our only credit card loan, a hospital bill (got a payoff discount of 50%), grad school loan (another 50% discount off), possibly a car loan (still thinking of this one).. Ladies, do look into getting what is called an early payoff discount for some of your bills/loans.  I am a business woman by trade so I either wrote a letter or called my creditors/banks and bargained for the best deal.  I started my speech with \"I have been deemed disabled by Social Security Admin, how can I request for a loan/bill write-off?\"  Once they told me they don't offer this, then I ask for a the early payoff discount.  I paid off most of our bills with a 50% early payment discount.  I love it!  Oh yes, I have also put money aside for 6 months for that 'rainy' day, also some money for a vacation and the rest we are putting away on a CD or something.  Also, I have put aside money for church or charity or something.",
