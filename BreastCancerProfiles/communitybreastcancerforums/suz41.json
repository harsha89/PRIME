Mine was aggressive though and I didn't want to risk recurrence in a few years or less. I know there is no evidence to prove that it would recur but for me it removed some worry from my mind. I also reconstructed and am happy with the results. I had a one-step procedure with alloderm and silicone implants. It is a very individual decision but for what it is worth I don't have any regrets. Best of luck with your decision. ~Suze",

I also ordered \"queasy pops\" from a website that my mother-in-law told me about. It helped to suck on them throughout the day. My nauseau never went away completely but I felt a bit better and not so dizzy. The website is www.threelollies.com I hope you feel better soon.....chemo is a necessary evil!! Suze",
