I just purchased a few shirts in a size larger than what I wore pre-surgery. Buttons and zippers are a HUGE help. Even after the doctor lets you lift your arms, you will still want your clothes to be easy to get in and out of. My very favorite was a plain Hanes zippered hoodie. It was soft, easy to put on, and I could pin my drains inside and not feel like they were bulging out for everyone to see.",

I did a lot of reading on here the last year or so but just recently \"joined.\" I had my bil- MX last December 15 - what a difference 10 months makes.

If you have the stomach to do it, it is pretty cool to watch them fly out underneath your skin. Plus, if by some wild chance it does feel uncomfortable ~ the second you sit up without them, will make it worth while. :)",

He told me I had cancer and wanted to talk to me as long as I needed to talk. After I asked my questions, (I was kind of in shock because even when they did the biopsy the Radiologist had told me that everything looked good to her) he asked me to come back to the office the next afternoon and bring someone with me. At that appointment we talked through everything, he went over my pathology report with us,Â showed me pictures of my various options, talked to me about a Plastic Surgeon (questions like did I want a man or a woman, someone young or older, etc . . ) and then asked if he could put me on the prayer list at his church. He made it as easy as he could in the situation. Right after he called the first day to tell me I had cancer, the Radiologist called me and gave me her cell phone number and said she was available if I needed to talk. I have to admit, I was SUPER impressed with my doctors!",
