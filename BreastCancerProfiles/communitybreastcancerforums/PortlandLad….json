I won't have time to freeze them, I think, they are due to arrive Tuesday and my first treatment is Thursday. But maybe if I get them in the freezer Tuesday evening I can practice myself Wed. I don't think I can ask my helper, who is a volunteer I haven't met, to come over Wed. I'm already feeling like this a big job for anyone to commit to. Any other tips? Boy, there is a lot to learn with all of this!!",

I have someone for at least the first 2 treatments and I think the other 2 as well. It's overwhelming how much is involved in doing the cold caps - having all the equipment, supplies, etc. But I know it will be worth it if I can keep my hair. It's about dignity and confidence for me. Also, I depend on my business and don't want to lose projects because I look sick. I have to try...",

I was diagnosed in June with Stage II Triple Negative BC. The main lump is quite painful so I'l coming to the conclusion that it has to go. But I'm so afraid of the chemo - was hoping to avoid it. However. my oncologists firmly believe that not only is it necessary but they want to do it first. So yesterday I had the port surgery and got it in my arm instead of my chest.(As it turns out my amazing surgical oncologist was also recently diagnosed and had a port in her arm. Figured, if it's good enough for her, it's good enough for me!). I start chemo on July 11: 4 treatments 3 weeks apart of Taxotere and Cytoxan. My MO says it's a pretty gentle therapy - would you agree? I'm most terrified about hair loss so ordered Penguin Cold Caps today. I hope I'll be able to manage them as I'm by myself and not sure who will be able to assist for so many hours that it takes to use them. But I'm determined to give this a try.  The other thing that worries is that I'm a widow (to cancer) and run a business that my livelihood depends on. My MO thinks I'll only have one down day 3 days after treatment and be pretty OK the rest of the time. I'm hoping that's true - although I know everyone reacts differently.  Anyway, thanks to all of you for your wisdom borne of this horrible disease. Sorry we have this in common but thanks in advance for your love and support - back atcha!!",
