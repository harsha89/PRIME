I'm a total type A personality who is NOT comfortable with spur of the moment decisions. I was diagnosed about a month ago and am meeting with a second surgeon this week for another opinion before I make a decision of what to do. There is so very much to consider/learn and I\"m feeling rushed which stresses me right out! I'm told that pretty much any option is open to me so it's just a matter of choice. One minute I want a lumpectomy because they tell me that Lumpectomy V. Mastectomy has the same life expectancy. Then I jump to BMX without reconstruction because I have dense breasts and fear that if a relapse or new cancer occurs they won't see it. Also because HER2 was inconclusive so I won't know about that or chemo until AFTER the surgery. I could just use prosthesis... or maybe flat and fabulous. Then I look in the mirror and try to picture myself flat chested and though I really could care less about breasts....I'm pretty sure that without them my belly will look twice as big and that has always been a concern. So would I really consider reconstruction and additional risk/surgery for that reason? It makes me sound so vain... and yet... if I'm being honest I know I will have trouble adjusting to that. Then I read all the posts and it seems that no matter which way I go there are big issues! Lumpectomy leaves me even more lopsided than I am now and worried about density. Many women on here have trouble and complications from Mastectomy and even MORE so with reconstruction. So far I haven't found anybody who says that prosthesis work well. Everyone says they don't stay put, they are hot (I live in Florida) or that they don't work well in the pool. Flat and fabulous... maybe... but can I live with the belly thing? I'm already one month in, and seem no closer to a decision. I HAVE to decide next week after the second opinion. I need to get this out of me!! Any help or advise based on your story would be much appreciated! She thought she could..... so she did! Dx 3/9/2018, IDC, Right, 1cm, Stage IA, Grade 1, 0/1 nodes, ER+/PR+ Log in to post a reply",
