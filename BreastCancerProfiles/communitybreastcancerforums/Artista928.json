The not knowing and the waiting was the worst for me. And the majority of all bc pts these days do live longer lives. Look at wallan above. 13 years out! There are threads here where people have posted their 5 year, 10 year, 15 year anniversary of being cancer free. And note that many members here have left the boards because they are far enough out and are doing well. Some of us stick around afterwards to help others and also keep informed. There's a lot of new stuff coming down the pike. The meds I'm on now I may not need to be on for the next 10 years. There may be something out even better that replaces this and for a shorter time. Who knows. So try not to think too far ahead. It sounds like you're in the meeting phase. Once the scans they want you to do are done then starts forming the treatment plan. Most of us had sx first but there are some who had chemo first. All depends on your profile. What I suggest. Be your own advocate. You came to the right place for info esp since a lot of it docs don't have time to give everything. I bought a planner which had a ton of space under each day. You'll need a good calendar for all the appts. In black I'd write my question. Leave some space. Took it with me to the appt and wrote the answer in red. Journaling also helped me. On another board I have a diary that's mainly for myself but others have been following it too. It's not organized and it's very long, personal stuff mixed in, which is why I don't link it here. Too hard to follow as my goal was to get my thoughts out and to jot what I learned down for myself. Keep busy. 4 kids ought to do it. I had 2 months before sx so it was a long wait for me. I just dug in these boards, journaled and was determined to become very informed and smart about this, not to just rely on the docs. I took it as a challenge, not a fun one, but one nonetheless. Best wishes. Hang in there and read and post. Tons of info and support here.",

If it were me in your shoes, I'd spend time today checking out this forum too. https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/80 Also I've never heard of rads before sx or before chemo. The purpose of rads is to \"clean out\" possibly any cancer cells that may be left behind in the breast that sx and chemo may have missed- so it's at the end. Try to keep calm and write down your questions for tomorrow. I always thought I'd remember them all but it never happened that way, esp under duress.

Nothing like being told you could be in heart failure and/or have pneumonia! They seem to think I had partial collapse of the lower lungs with fluid. Man it was so painful on top of not being able to breath and then my head was in such pain. I have never been so miserable in my life for those days last week. :/",

Aches, pain in neck now/constriction- just all around horrible feeling. Can't sleep. I mean I've done 8 and I have 20 to go?? This stuff adds up I know. I can't take any more. I'm calling the office at 8 when they open and talk to the nurse. This rads crap is tougher on me than chemo was and it's 8 down. And I am so very pooped. RO of course says it's not rads, when I was in the hospital. How do you know? I may be the small % that has such probs.",

So she told me ok to just use aloe vera 3 x a day and on #3 before bed put aquafore on. After week 2 then it's Miaderm 3 x day with aquafore before bed on top. She said don't bother buying aquafore as she has a zillion samples. As for Miaderm, she's going to try and stock me beyond the 1 tube so maybe I won't have to buy another tube. Very nice of her as I about fainted hearing $36 for a 4 oz tube of Miaderm! :O",

Have a cancer tx team of people you trust and feel comfortable with. That's key. A lot of this is mental too. You can get yourself in a tizzy just by thinking too much quite easily. There isn't much concrete about all this, why some do well or not-- a lot of it seems to be a crap shoot. The best thing you can do for yourself, which you are doing, is research, interview different providers---and go slow, remain calm and positive. Your body is fighting enough with cancer that it doesn't need added stress, so try to keep it as minimal as you can using meditation, yoga, or whatever relaxes you to help. Good luck with your meetings with providers this week.",

Focus on the here and now and not the what ifs for you don't know those details yet. Educate yourself on topics here of where you are at and don't go much further than where you are at in the process. Grade 3 cancers respond best to chemo so in that sense, aggressive is good. Try to relax and not get too far ahead of where you are at now and think the worst. Usually it isn't. :) ",

If so then not doing the tx that is prescribed may cause you to lose benefits. So it's not just your medical condition but if they think you are doing what your treating dr prescribes and what they say. That's what they really look at when it comes time for cdr (continuing disability review). If you get the long form they will ask for medical records so they will see what is written as well as what you are doing. So while you are doing yourself good in considering your options, SSDI may think you aren't based on what observations they wrote about as well. It's hard to say really. I've seen things get approved that I'm like wow, you got lucky while other times it seems obvious and it gets denied. I don't know when your next cdr is if you even know but if these notes could possibly be seen, I'd go back to those who wrote things negatively and clarify with them what you meant and have the notes ammended. Here's the best site for SSDI info and to get questions answered. Helped me a lot. GL! http://ssdfacts.com/forum/index.php ",

I had 4 nodes taken out, 2 of them sentinel, and micromets was found in a sentinel node. So it became 1 node involved. I completed AC 3 weeks ago (thank God) and last Tues had my first Taxotere of 4 which will be given every 3 weeks. So 2 more weeks of \"bliss.\" I had a chest xray among other tests before sx. It was clear. In Oct I had a CT scan. In my lung showed up a lung nodule and a spot on my pelvic bone. Fear struck since BC goes to liver, brain, lungs and bone. Bone scan a week later showed no metabolic activity. As for the lung, the nodule was too small for a PET scan to pick up on what it is so we wait. If after chemo it's still there then it's not mets. If it's gone then it could have been. No way of knowing because it could have been something else that just went away. This not knowing would drive me nuts so I hope it's still there after chemo.

The only ones I've read that were told ok for no chemo are stage 0 and 1. Lymph node involvement isn't the only thing to think about when thinking of chemo but if any of these suckers are loose in your blood stream, chemo would get it there. A lot depends on size of tumour, what kind of cancer (IDC, ILC, etc) it is, nodes involved, etc. Since much of this isn't really known until you get the surgery path results, it's hard to say what's the best thing to do at this point. So research is good but know that you don't have all your personal facts yet to make permanent decisions. I'm 51. Most people want to throw the book at it at any age to possibly not go through it again. As for hormone therapy, the fact that your are ER+ it's a great idea to at least try it. You want to suppress estrogen production which if you are ER+ then estrogen has been driving your cancer as well. The higher the % the more estrogen has been driving it. You want to shut it down as much as possible, which is why I don't find many people not doing hormone therapy at the end of txs unless they are having bad side effects they can't deal with. Having completed chemo a couple days ago, I will say that while it's not pleasant I feel that I threw the book at it because I sure don't want a recurrence and go through all this again. I look at people's sigs and wonder how on earth did this recur. Radiation is on tap next followed by hormone therapy for me. It looks daunting when you are just trying to wrap your mind around things and decide what to do, but once you have your sx and the path report and have it reviewed with your doc, things will start to flow better. And it makes a big difference in your mind once you have a plan in place and a date to start. Before all that I was kind of all over the place thinking no way this and that after some posts I read on side effects and such. But we are all different in how our bodies will react to tx. For me chemo overall wasn't too bad. I had a few bad days of nausea but other than that, nothing to note. There are meds to manage side effects. And I did it alone with no help which was a big concern for me. So do your research. You'll be looking at other people's details in their sig more once you get yours but like I said, what is prescribed for someone similar to you may not be the right one for you. Ask questions and keep an open mind. Best wishes to you and gl on your sx on Friday. :)",

I blew off pain for months, chalking it up to hormones and dense breasts. I was 49 and thought that's it, close to menopause. I'm famous for having cysts so I never really felt around. One morning on Memorial Day weekend 2015 the pain just shot up to where I was like ouch! Got worked in to my pcp who just sent me for mammo. Mammo showed something suspicious but they couldn't tell much due to very dense breasts. I was sent to u/s right after and all they saw was blotches that they said they never seen before. Could be a tumor. So next day was biopsy to see what the splotches on the photos were. 2 cm mass at the largest diameter. BS wanted to know how accurate it was before going in so I had an mri which showed 4 cm at the largest diameter. 3 cm was completely hidden. It is possible to have bc and to show on mammo or u/s. Not sure about mri. But mri is the best imaging for suspicious dense breasts. I'm hanging in, thanks. They say it's over when treatments end but it's not for me and those of us done but here still posting about issues. Currently waiting to do a pelvic u/s on 5/1 to hopefully confirm my discomfort is uterine fibroids irritated by tamoxifen and not something worse. I hope you both find answers soon. I think the worst part was the not knowing. It took 4 days for the results of the biopsy and it felt like 4 years. At least whatever it is you can go forth with treating it. Good luck. :)",

That would really help me as the more I've sat on this thing, the more I see I'm going with her. I doubt my current onc can fax the order to her and she with her name on to the center. There's liability there and who's responsible if something comes up. So while my bs will call this onc to see if she's heard of such a thing and if there are cash plans, I'm thinking Wexler will be out unless there is a way we're not thinking of in which they can go around to make it work. Just when I thought things were going smooth, today happened. No way am I going to that center where Wexler is. Not worth the commute after seeing it's dingy and looks like it hasn't been cleaned since the 70s.

Pain in breast not lletting up for weeks is not a muscle imo. I'm going through similar with my side pain that feels it's in my kidney area, on and off. I know it's not muscle. Pain meds would help a muscle issue. See the doc who ordered the u/s and see what he/she says. Not trying to scare you but mammo and u/s doesn't always show everything with dense breasts. My mammo, u/s, biopsy suggested 2 cm, mri showed my mass 4 cm. At surgery it was found to be 7 cm. Dense breasts do that. Mine was bell shaped, a weird shape, so 3 cm was completely hidden even with mri. Hope it is benign for you but do keep trying to find answers for the pain.",

The staging becomes most apparent after the lump is removed and if lymph nodes are removed too, what the path shows on that. My stage went up after I had sx and my lump that they thought on MRI was 4 cm with no lymph node involvement was actually 7 cm with 1 node involved. But the focus shouldn't be on the stage in terms of thinking of prognosis. How aggressive is it? Is it ER+? What's the HER2 status.. and on it goes. And even then, a stage I who looks like has the best case turn out could later on come back stage IV and someone stage IIIC could be sitting there for the rest of their lives. It's the biggest crap shoot for no one can predict what's likely necessarily based on someone else's #s being similar or same as yours. Go slow and try not to panic. Wait to get the reports and jot down questions. Study the boards here according where she is at in the process. Don't go too far out from where she is. Ask and research here. You'll learn a lot more here from those of us in the trenches than you will from medical providers aside from the actual diagnosis. Once your wife has more info, post in the proper forum for people to try and help. The more details you put in your sig, like you see in mine, the more people can try and help. But always keep in mind that no two people are alike and there's never a way to ever know if she will turn out like this person or that person. That sucks but unfortunately there is no rhyme or reason for why this for this person and not for this person... I think if it was like that there would be a cure by now.",

Folks here know about the process. http://ssdfacts.com/forum/index.php Getting SSDI is very difficult. You may have to go with state disability if your state has it. In CA it's up to a year. All you need is your doc to say you are unable to work and provide records. That's it. SSDI depends on how much you've worked I think during the past 5 years. Also income. But the most difficult part is proving to SS that you cannot do anything, even mop a floor, for at least a year. It's not just not being able to do your job, but at your age, it's anything in the economy and some of the job titles they come up with is funny. SSDI also takes a very very very long time to get an answer. Majority of people wait a year or two to get in front of a judge after being denied, which most people are at the initial app. Check out that board I posted above. It's very informative from people who have been through the process and even some who worked for SS.",

If you are below 50, can you do any job in the national economy. If you are over, can you do your old type of job. They send out either a short form for you to check off how you are doing typically for those who are probably not going to improve or the long form which is similar to what you fill out at initial app and they'll also ask for med records to back up what you are stating. I've studied that forum where you will find the most help in the active q & a both before I was approved (for something else) and for when it's review time. That's why I say go for the state disability first if your state has it as all it is is a sig of your doctor basically. Easy. In CA that's for up to a year. Not all SSDI cases get approved that quickly so just in case, start the state one which will have you receiving $ in a month. My friend who was in active heart failure did this while she waited for SSDI. She was on SD for 3 months before SSDI got approved then her SD stopped.",

The best we all hope for is that we are currently not showing sign of the disease. What her treatment will be really depends on her pathology report. Take a look at my signature for example. My oncologist went off of this primarily to decide my treatment plan. The thing is I can have the same #s and treatment as another person showing exactly my #s and treatment, and come out with a different outcome down the line. So it's not always the case to say this person looks to be in better shape than me long term. Maybe, maybe not. Try not to get worried until you have the path report. Then post it what stage and all the details and we can take a crack at what she'll probably be looking at. Again do NOT fall for any alternative treatment. Nothing is better than chemo and/or rads if the path report warrants it. A small # of women don't need either but again it depends on their path report. Make sure your mom has a good oncologist.

If you're going to be scanned, I wouldn't go with a pcp who isn't specialized in this. Go with what an MO says. You get radiation with scans so I wouldn't want to do it unless an MO is issuing the order cuz I'd hate to have to repeat it and get more rads because pcp didn't know.",

When I was put in a psych ward 6 years ago pre-bc they were more concerned about my getting better asap/image stuff than what's going on with me. They gave me simple to understand info to give to my fam to understand what's happening to me and I saw they threw it away. No support. So with bc I chose not to include fam. They don't know and I have no intention of ever spilling. I'm not a fit for them, never have been. So I just stay in touch with mom/dad via email and not much the rest. I have major anxiety issues and their insensitivity could drive me back to the ward again so I'm doing what's best for me. As for what I told them for being mia for the past 3+ years except email and cards is anxiety. Feel so much better not being around such stress. Sometimes it's best to be alone than surrounded by people who ultimately aren't a positive for you. I have a great friend here and my bro who knows about my bc is cool. Everyone else who doesn't get it, bye. They aren't your true friends. I've said no plenty of times to my bff here and she's cool. I don't hear you are STILL tired after 2 years being out? My fam would say that.. So I let go of anything that doesn't help me and forge on. Join us here community.breastcancer.org/for... where us singles talk about anything and everything with being single. There are other such threads to to join in. You aren't alone.",

I still wonder why the first onc said Taxol and this one is Taxotere if it's basically the same thing. I don't have allergies to anything. I think in my case that perhaps my current onc was weighing the best course of tx since I was handed to her so far out from sx. Most people meet their oncs before sx, long before the 2 days I had before mine. Maybe if I had met her around the time of my diagnosis in June and this nodule was there it may have been steered differently. But then the nodule would may not have even been there since it was 6mm last month at CT. It would be so nice if it was more clear cut but unfortunately cancer doesn't seem to be, even with people who seem to have the exact same dx.",

Got to sx 2 months after dx due to needing ps and bs both present. Had 4 drains in for 5 weeks instead of the average of up to 2 weeks. A couple weeks later the skin area above my right tissue expander became infected. 7 days of Amoxacilan did nothing so I was admitted to the hospital for 5 days of IV abx. Had a picc line placed and sent home for another week of self adminstered IV abx. Once all was clear, MO does the pre-chemo standard tests she does and finds I'm severely anemic. So 3 days of IV iron infusions. Sx was 8/6. Started chemo 11/3, exactly on the line of the most effectiveness of chemo, but what can you do. You have to be well before you undergo chemo. So all is going ok on schedule thereafter all the delays until on 2/27 I go to pay my BC insurance premiums through Covered CA exchanged and it's been cancelled. What?? Long story short, with a lot of back and forth for almost a month they had mistakenly changed my income to 0 and threw me on Medi-Cal. So my last chemo was about a month late. I had started rads when a week in I had both lungs partially collapse and so I was in the hospital for 3 days and the following I felt some chest pain so no rads for a couple days there--- a total of a week behind in rad schedule. So I had a longer than average active tx time line, starting 8/6/15 with bmx w/tissue expander placements to final rads completed mid-June 2016. I asked my MO how long do I have before needing to get on Tamox and she said up to a year but of course sooner if you can do it. I gave myself a month off to recover more from chemo and rads before popping the pill. So the moral of the story is if you can't stick to the \"schedule\" it doesn't mean you are doomed. Plenty of things happen that interferes with getting tx and people wind up being fine.",

I had a non-relenting infection of a month and still kind of counting and before that, 5 weeks of drains while my cohorts got theirs out after maybe 1 or 2. And before that, finding out about this onc around the corner from me is much better and knowleged than the one I started out with on 8/4, 2 days before my sx. So it took time to see her as a new patient as well. The most effective time frame for chemo after sx is 6-8 weeks with 10 weeks max according to my MO's research, no matter how strong the chemo is. The 6 mm nodule in my lung is too small for a PET scan to really capture what it is, which is why she's chosen the path of let's do chemo and see what happens to be safe. I asked her wouldn't doing a stage IV tx be better since it is possible it's a met. She said and if it isn't, precious time would be gone and I was already just outside the ideal time frame for chemo to be most effective. So who knows which path but I have to trust my MO and I do. She's very highly rated not just by her peers but by pts.",

My first MO was Taxol. This one is Taxotere. So there has to be something other than the carrier that leads to choosing one over the other when allergies are not involved off the bat. Then when I see my MO next I'll ask her. The only other thing I can think of is the center having the chemical on hand. I was going to use another center with the Taxol tx but then again, she was on the border with Taxotere. So maybe they carry both and this one carries the one. Other than that, I have no clue if they are the same minus the carrier.",

While waiting for results for that they will take your weight and vitals. They send this info to pharmacy and they prepare the chemo. That usually takes up to an hour. About 1/2 hour or so before you receive chemo they give you premeds which are mostly to help with nausea. Adriamycin is about 15-20 minutes to infuse. Cytoxan is about a couple hours, so plan on being there awhile. 4-5 hours sounds right. It also depends on how busy they are. Mine was short staffed so a couple of times I was there longer. Don't plan for anything too close afterwards just in case. Monday (day of chemo) you won't feel much of anything. First dose. The next day for me at least was some nausea starting to creep up. Drink tons of liquids (water, broth..) and take your nausea meds even if you don't feel it on schedule. Chemo is only working for an hour and it takes 48-72 hours to leave the body which is why the first 2-3 days after drinking is more important than eating. Fatigue was another than slowly set in. Many had issues with constipation too. Prunes was my friend during those times. Chemo is cumulative so as you get into it the SEs can go up. I was very lucky with not having it as bad as many. And my #2 was the worse one over #4 so it doesn't always follow the last one will be the worst SE. For me the first few days after the first day after were the worse. Theoretically you get better the further out but again, it varies with person and also which dose. You'll get an idea of how your body reacts after your first dose but the others can be different. The only thing that didn't let up as I went along was fatigue but I got through it. I've been in this entire journey by myself with no help so it is doable. But if you do have help enlist them when you need it. Are you getting Neulasta the day after? This helps boost up your white blood cell counts which take a dive with chemo and compromises your immune system. You may want to ask about it if you haven't already. The SE from this shot you get the next day is possible bone pain but you take Claritin the night before, day of and day after the shot. Good luck. East a small breakfast before you go and take snacks/water if your center doesn't have much in the way of this. PS: Join the May 2016 chemo group to follow along with others together. Sharing of info helps in such threads.",

Being late is typical. Things come up and if the doc/surg is popular then it's expected. I used to provide cookies, coffee and water to help with pt complaints as the surgs I worked for were very busy taking care of biz, putting out fires, etc then they have the pts in the office. I wouldn't read much into it. If the doc showed interest, gave you the time, and you find more good reviews than bad then she should be ok. Also note that sometimes I found when seeing what was put out there on one of our surgs was overly exaggerated. When one thing was wrong, and I mean not something big, it was written like stay away from this place. I'd ask the pt if they came in why and found out it really wasn't a big deal, was having a bad day/life. Great. Please think about your review before posting it. Just thought I'd mention that. GL.",

Last year I had the traditional silver bracelet on with the red medic symbol. When my lungs collapsed and EMS came, they just reached for the nearest arm, which was my left one with this bracelet on. I was too busy and kind of out of it to point out no and they didn't bother with my bracelet. I think since the first thing they do when they walk in is to take your bp and they are in a gather info mode, it gets missed. And unfortunately, many medical folks do not know what lymphedema is so I bagged that word and just laid out what not to do. I found a site where I can clearly create my own silicone bracelet from how wide I want it, what font, size, color of bands, and it has clip art with the red cross medic alert symbol. Great customer service. They send you a proof of what it'll look like as many times as you want to change it and won't send it to production until you say go. Great price too. Love how I order 1 and find 2 or 3 bands. I ordered the green cammo one and got 2 bands for the price of 1. I just got this grey one today with 2 more. How can the EMS miss this??? I wear it with the words facing my hand and not my body. PS: this format isn't one you can select. Place the order for the ink injected band so you can request the medic symbol to be in red with font front and back and when you get a confirmation email, reply back to it showing them how it should be formatted. https://www.rapidwristbands.com/order#/order Dx'd at 50.

I live in Fremont and had all my care at Washington Hospital since it was around the corner from me. If you haven't checked yelp yet, check him out there. I used to work for a very busy (cocky/pioneer) surgeons office. He and his partner are the real deal. He was more humble though in front of his pts. When pts praised him to the heavens he would play it down, but us staff new. Many docs are cocky so that shouldn't be a concern unless he's not spending enough time learning about your wife and too much building himself up. Thoughts: Google alloderm and see if his name is anywhere. Not a bad idea to post a thread his name on this board under Recon (since you are asking about a PS) to see if anyone around here knows him. We can also help dig to see if we come up with anything. I know a few other bay area peeps so you may get a pt review right here. I wish I could remember who had their care at UCSF here. Ask the office if they do have pts who would be willing to talk to you. We had a list of pts who were willing to talk to new pts. Also: Did he spend good amount of time with you? Did he answer your questions? What's the gut feel? ",

You caught it early, it's small, IDC is very common and with it being ER+ Her2- it's one of the best possible outcomes. While it seems overwhelming you'll be amazed once you have a plan in place it becomes easier to deal. And once you start the plan, it's even easier to deal. Try not to fret. These days bc is very treatable. While you know some details on it it's after surgery where you'll know more. For now just focus on keeping yourself busy/distracted and calm.

Is there such a thing as buy the duster robe you want and glue pouch pockets on that say a nurse could do for you in the hospital to see where it should be located for best results in holding the drains since I'm not at all coordinated? Sounds like I\"m going to have 2 drains on each side. Will 1 chest pocket on each side work? I don't know what it's going to look like. Thanks!",

I've decided on bilat mxs because the right one has a 5mm lesion that they can't rule out for sure that it's nothing, just that it looks like nothing. Well, that's how the left one started, and I have occasional pain/discomfort in it so my decision is sealed. My problem is I am alone. I don't have home care benefits on my insurance plan. I understand I will need to do bandage changes and drain the drains which are 4 total 3 times a day. Wow. Bonus for me is I have generalized anxiety for which I am on meds for and am on disability for. On top of my regular meds I take Ativan for the times I need more help with anxiety. The bad thing is this makes you really loopy and I know I'm already going to be loopy and all after surgery. I talked to a social worker and she says I could get a home care person but it is very pricy because you have to get insurance on them to for if they get hurt or mess me up. Minimum would be $65 per VISIT, not per day or I could figure that out. So that's out for sure. Anyone here in my boat of being alone and not being able to handle drainings 3 x a day for 2 weeks??? Yeah they say it's easy to do, but I have diagnosed anxiety which landed me in the hospital before so it's not just your regular anxiety. Anyone else to call/contact? What to do? TIA! Dx'd at 50.

I'm thinking about getting pink pockets as was suggested as I can just stick them at the right place on any garmet I'm wearing. That and the shower belt as far as the managing the drains go. Just curious, esp about if you feel them hanging/tugging esp since they go down so far?",

We can better address your concerns that way. Take it one step at a time. MO is on fence about chemo and treatments because nothing is a known until surgery. What info you are getting now is a best guess. Some people upon sx for example found out their tumor is smaller than they had thought or vice versa. They simply cannot know for sure until they go in. What to do now is decide lx or bmx. Age seems to play a big part in decisions. Younger people seem to opt more for lx than someone like me who was 50 at diagnosis. What led me to bmx is while I know there is no 100% guarantee that just because you remove the breast(s) that it won't come back, I felt more comfortable if not just psychologically being rid of worrying about it. I for one HATE mammos. Now no mammos because no breasts. I hated my breasts pre-cancer. DD/DDD and saggy heavy because they were dense. Now I have size C implants that are firm and look and feel better on me than my originals. I agree that you should spend your time now reading how people came to their decisions lx vs bmx, esp those in your age group. It's a personal decision that each one of us makes for ourselves. Best wishes.",

They all sucked equally but was very doable for me. Even my chemo nurses used that term and I had to tell them not to. It made me look for things and expect things that simply didn't happen.
