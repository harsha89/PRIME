I think I am starting to go crazy over this BC scare. I know that I should be happy that I got benign results from both my core needle and stereotactic biopsies, but now am questioning whether I should have just done the excisional biopsy as well.  I keep wondering if there is possibility of getting 2 false negative results. Crazy, huh???? Just tell me that those odds are very low. I have pushed my 6 month follow up to Feb 1st (making it now a 5 month follow-up) just so I can get it over with and move on...whether good or bad.  I tired of constantly feeling around my breasts for possible lumps.  i just don't want to be scared anymore.  I feel that this is consuming me. And then I feel terrible because so many wonderful, beautiful, courageous women received unexptected, not-so-good results and are being so much stronger than I am. Thank you all for your support",

It is on the upper outer quadrant.  It really only hurts when I touch it.  It almost feels like a bruise...more tender than painful. I had a mammo and ultrasound and they saw nothing concerning on that left breast (however, I had to have 2 biopsies for an unpalpable lump on my right breast...total shock.  Luckily both biopsies showed normal breast tissue...I am having a follow up mammo in Feb...scared out of my mind). I saw my OBG about this lump on my left breast and he seems to think it is purely hormonal as it pops up 2 weeks before my period (right around ovulation time).  He did state that I have very very dense fibrocystic breasts.  There is the same lump on my right breast in the same general area (not as big though) and this one does not cause me pain.  The pain does seem to go away during my period, but then pops up about 10 days later. Of course I keep touching this area constantly (which my doc told me not to do as I exacerbate the problem).  Just wondering if anyone else experiences this and if in fact, it is just fibrocystic disease. I am not too concerned about this as my mammo and ultrasound showed nothing, but it is rather annoying.  I am very worried about my follow up mammo though.  Even after having an ultrasound core needle and stereotactic biopsies on the unpalpable area that showed nothing I feel like I am obsessing over touching my breasts and trying to feel for lumps. It is very hard to detect lumps wtih such dense breasts.  Any advice???? Thanks  Log in to post a reply",

Back in Sept, I had initial mammo and ultrasound (age 37).  Radiologist found 1.6cm unpalpable lump in right breast. Birad4.  I did an ultrasound core needle biopsy and got benign results of normal breast tissue.  Just to make sure we hit the correct spot we followed up with a stereotactic biopsy, which also yielded normal breast tissue. I was scheduled for a 6 month follow up, which would have been mid-March.  However, this scare has been driving me crazy...constantly feeling for things that may or may not be there....wondering if these things are just fibrous tissue (as I have very fibrocystic breasts) or indeed lumps. I even went back to my surgeon about 3 weeks ago to have him check to see if he felt something on my right breast. He said \"no\" but did note that I have very dense breasts.  My 6 month follow up had now become an \"almost 5 month follow-up\" since I am so ready to get it over with and try to move on - one wasy or the other.  So, in 9 days I will have my follow up. I am scare to get less than good results. I am scared to hear the radiologist say, once again: step into my office...we are unsure...additional tests needed,etc. Am I being crazy.

The very next day I had an ultrasound guided core needle biopsy.  Results came back as normal breast tissue.  Just to make sure we hit the right spot, a breast surgeon did a mammatome biopsy.  Results again came back as normal breast tissue.    I know how hard the waiting is.

I had a 6 month follow up which also showed up normal, Birad 2 (benign). I was due for my annual screening mammo this week, but asked my doc if I could have a diagnostic mammo instead. This time it is due to a large lump on my right breast.  My OBG checked it out and said everything seemed normal and that it is just fibrocystic changes.  But, he was kind enough to submit an order for a diagnostic mammo and ultrasound to be performed for peace of mind.  I am getting them done tomorrow.  My period is due any day now so I think this is all due to hormones, but am still freaking out. I always have a painful lump that developes in my left breast when I ovulate, which is tender.  Now I have developed a painless lump on my right breast (upper area around 11 - 12:00).  I honestly cannot say if this is a normal occurrence in regards to my menstrual cycle. Ever since my scare I have become obsessed in feeling for lumps.  I am driving myself crazy. On my diagnostic mammo 7 months ago, nothing abnormal showed up at all on either of my breasts.  Is it possible that this lump could have grown this quickly over this short period of time?  Am I being nutty?  I am so tired of worrying about my breasts. Although I am petrified for tomorrow I can't wait for it just to be over.  I want to stop obsessing!!  Thanks for listening!!!

And - does it mean anything that it is close to the skin (superficial?) - but then, why wouldn't we be able to feel it? The surgeon is leaning towards more of \"fibrocystic changes\" rather than a \"fibroadenoma\".  He said due to the shape.  Does that make sense?  Is 1.6 cm big?  The radiologist was concerned about the \"shadowing\" underneath it, but the surgeon said that most solid masses have \"shadowing\" due to the soundwaves (or something)??? Could the biopsy come back as \"fibrocystic changes\".  Is that a possible finding?

I actually saw the 2 clips they placed on the biopsied area on mammogram today. The pathologist said nothing to worry about.  I meet with my breast surgeon on Thursday just to confirm that all is okay, but the radiologist today didn't even feel the need to do an ultrasound again. I will, however, be getting yearly mammograms...maybe even another in 6 months, which is fine by me.  This past scare has taught me to be very proactive and insist on tests, procedures and reassurance if I feel something is \"just not right\". Sounds like you in a similar situation.  Trust me - it took A LOT for me to relax about this. In fact, I didn't feel confident (even with 2 benign biopsies) until today.  In fact, I vomited twice this morning before my mammo.  But, just try to just think positive and be happy with your results.  I know - easier said than done.  Been there, done that.",
