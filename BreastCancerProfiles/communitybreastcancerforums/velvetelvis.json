I'm glad I'm working in the morning, so I'll be distracted...but I don't expect I'll get a whole lot done. Part of the problem is that I've felt, in the back of my mind, like my boobs were ticking time bombs ever since my first cancer DX. And because I got off so lightly that time (it was stage 1b and had just started to become invasive, so I lucked out and just had to have a hysterectomy--no chemo and no rads), the superstitious side of me is just waiting for the other shoe to drop.  What should I expect? I reckon he'll do another manual exam, but beyond that I don't know what's planned. If they do a biopsy, how soon should I expect the results?  Sometimes I'm really scared. Other times I tell myself I'm being over-dramatic. I keep reminding myself not to borrow trouble, but I've never been a believer in positive thinking--I have too much Slavic fatalism in me for that. Before I got my endometrial cancer DX I had played the \"I'm sorry, it's cancer\" scenario through my mind a thousand times. When I got the news, I felt like already having acknowledged that it could be cancer lessened the shock.   *deep breath* Philippians 4:13! (And I may end up coming back here soon and feeling like an idiot for having blown a molehill up into a mountain, pun intended.)  Thanks for listening.",

      "Content": "Aug 24, 2011 03:14PM - edited Aug 24, 2011 03:17PM by velvetelvis Hi, ladies. Well, I had my appointment, and the BS said something to the effect of \"The chances of this being cancer are almost none.\" He said it's probably a tiny bit of fatty tissue. (Fat is an ongoing problem for me. LOL)  He didn't even take a biopsy, saying that it doesn't feel like cancer and is too small to get a sample from, and he doesn't believe in random biopsies anyway. I was disappointed at first, because when I went in I was bound and determined to get it biopsied--just so I could KNOW exactly what the lump was. But over the past 24 hours I've started to relax and accept that he knows what he's talking about and there really is nothing wrong with me. I've talked about this a lot with a dear friend who is also a veteran of an alcoholic parent and an abused childhood--the fact that we both have a superstitious, almost subconscious belief that the other shoe is always about to drop, and therefore we'd best prepare by worrying obsessively. It's something I'm praying on. I have a \"just in case\" checkup w/mammo and US scheduled for November, but chances are I'm just fine, if paranoid. ;)  Thanks so much for all of your support. I will pray for all of you. God bless. ",

I had some pain in my breasts for the first time a few weeks ago, which has since subsided, but after doing a self-exam I found a small, hard lump underneath my left nipple. It doesn't seem to move. I never had problems with my breasts during my periods, and I had a complete hysterectomy with bilateral salphingo oophaerctomy almost 2 years ago. I'm not on any kind of hormone-replacement therapy.  I visited my gyn-oncologist and got breast exam from both her and a resident. She didn't think the lump was anything to worry about, but she's conscientious, so she referred me for a diagnostic mammo and US last Friday. Got both tests done and nothing, not even cysts or calcifications, showed up. The technician told me that my breasts are very fatty (I'm only 42, but I guess menopause and obesity aged them early or something) rather than dense, so they're easy to read. They couldn't tell me what the lump is, but said it was \"probably just glandular tissue\".  My gyn-onc called me with the results a few days later...they were totally negative. However, she referred me to a breast surgeon--my app't is next Tuesday. She wasn't satisfied with the findings, since the mass is palpable. Now I'm trying to strike a balance between preparing for the worst and not getting over-dramatic. I know most of these turn out to be benign, but I'm a worrier. And having had endometrial cancer just a couple of years ago, I'm not so sure...they didn't think I had endometrial cancer either, until I asked my doctor to do one last biopsy, just in case. Factors on my side include a lack of family history (as far as I know) and statistics. On the other hand, I'm obese, have already had one estrogen-linked cancer, and my dad died almost 3 years ago of metastasized lung cancer. They never found out where it originated from, which spooks me. It could have been colon or one of the other bad-news ones where breast cancer is concerned.   The mass is still there. I get sharpish pains in my breast every once in a while, but nothing major. The nipple hasn't changed and neither has the skin, and there's no discharge.   So. It'll be what it is. But I wish I just knew already! Log in to post a reply",
