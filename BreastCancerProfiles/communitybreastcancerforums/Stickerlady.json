    "Content": "Stickerlady wrote: I am having  bad joint pain in my fingers 2 will not bend, hips knees and feet. I had the hip and feet pain before treatment. I had Taxatore, and Cytoxin last summer and 33 sessions of Radiation in Sept. Oct. last year so I am 6 months after treatments are over. I am so tired I just want to lay down and all during Radiation I had no tiredness. I had my apt. with all 3 Dr.s and I am Cancer FREE. I just wish I had more energy. The Oncoligest  said to take 2,000  of Vit. D so I started that yesterday and the Surgeon gave me a perscription for Meloxicam (Mobic). . The Dr's think it is because I went into Menopause over a 2 week time and that is how my body reacted to it. Does anyone know if the Chemo causes Joint pain or is it Menopause? Does anyone have this problem and what did you do for it? Log in to post a reply",
