I've never heard that term but picture you diving head first into a dumpster lol. I am sure that you do not mean that literally. Before I moved to OR, I lived in an affluent town. I used to take different routes to work depending on when \"trash\" day is. I picked up a lot of beautiful patio furniture,spring was a great time to \"dumpster dive\". I would always try to hide my face. I would drive slowly and when i spotted something along the curb, I would get out of my car, clad in my dress clothes and put so many things in my trunk. i would not admit this if I was not slouching lol. I used to jog ten miles, five days a week before my old knees starting giving out on me. I started cycling with my DH when I gave up jogging and think I could easily ride more miles but he does not let me ride alone. He tries to be controlling. One of these days, he will find himself controlling the spiders on our walls after I move back East. Sorry, not a topic for a slouchers thread. Hoping all of you laides are feeling good and doing well. If anyone is still slouching at this late hour, let me know and I will send cyber rounds to you. God, I just love this thread, thank you ladies for allowing me to join you. Happy slouching, my new friends. Here is a toast to all of you... Cheers",

It has not been as fun lately as always rode with my DH but I am so mad at him. If we ride, I may just cut him off and make him ride of a cliff. Glad you were talking about tea biscuits when referring to naughtiness. You had me worried girl, you and three guys with tutus? Hmmmm. Don't know what to think of that.

      "Content": "Nov 22, 2011 12:53AM - edited Nov 22, 2011 12:56AM by cycle_babe Weesa, thanks for sharing this amazing story. I would love to make the next annual slouchfest. Like you, I am not a fan on Pinktober either. This disease is deadly serious and I have lost too many friends to BC. I had tried to live a reasonably healthy lifestyle but the stress of things since diagnosis has turned me into a closet sloucher. When I socialize publicly with people who know of my diagnosis, I do not have an adult beverage, I sit in the kiddy korner with my seltzer water or iced tea.So what is this theme song? This is too fun! And how fab is it that Celtic came to your Slouchfest, yes? I want to be sure I have this right - she came from CA to NC for this event, yes? Amazing. I have not been here long but love the way the ladies seem to click with one another.  Claire, are you serious that your bike club rides until your butt freezes off?  Crap, I am too wimpy to ride when it is under 20 degrees unless the sun is warm. I go to the gym and get my ride on.  Freezing my butt off does not sound fun to me but I am a weakling. Biking, bakeries and microbreweries sound fun but are you serious? Have never heard of such a thing. I guess this explains the guys in tutus, I am still baffled over that one lol. I am going to virtually step into Weesa's bar and have the bar tender, make that \"slouch-tender\" (haha) whip up a pitcher for me. 1/2 vodka, 1/2 iced tea and I am set. I will share a glass if someone likes what I am haviing lol! Might as well add a huge platter of deep fried mozzarella sticks, greasy fries.then finish of with a cheese cake with strawberries. Then another pitcher of my favorite slouching drink. What a nice group of ladies you are.  I am a stage1 gal but have two dear friends who are stage IV so I can relate. Can I come and join you, please, with sugar on top???",

I was told to use my hands to \"crawl\" slowly up the wall until I could fully extend my arms. I was never told not to raise them.
