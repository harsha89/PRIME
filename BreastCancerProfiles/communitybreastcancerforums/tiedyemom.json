Had my last AC treatment last Monday and am STILL teatering between feeling good and feeling like poop!  Been very emotional these past few days. I'm a week into my three week break before starting Taxotere-had planned to feel great and enjoy it, instead.......I just want to cry!! I've had a bit of the watery eye issue, but my big struggle is with my mouth....SO dry and sore!  The roof of my mouth is peeling off and my tongue is covered in blisters.  NOT fun!!! Mardibra-I am prescribed the same decadron dose before taxotere in a couple of weeks.  Didn't know it was a steriod-no wonder I'm a raving witch when I'm on it!  Up till now it was only two pills at a time......the idea of four the night before scares the crud out me. Today is my birthday, so I guess I'm going to put that stupid wig and some make-up on and try to make the best of it with my family tonight. Hugs to you all. ",

I shaved my head about 4 weeks after my first treatment and I really think it's been the hardest part for me so far!  It's had such an impact on my self-esteem.  My hubby and boys are wonderful about it, but I HATE it!!  I seem to be having a harder time bouncing back after each treatment.  The more treatments, the longer it takes to \"feel good again\".  Anyone else? ",
