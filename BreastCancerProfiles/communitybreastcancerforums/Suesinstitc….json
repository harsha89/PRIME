I had my excisional biopsy today and because of the 4th of July holiday, need to wait extra time for the results.  Somehow I seem to get stuck waiting over holidays.  First Memorial Day now the fourth!  I can't sleep well tonight after sleeping most of the day after the pain meds I had.  It's going to be a very long night. Prior to the surgery, I'd been obsessively feeling for the lump that was not seen on the mamo but the mri picked up,  I think in the last few days I've been able to feel it,  is it possible for it to grow that fast over a few months?  This next week is going to be soooo long,  As well as tonight.",

Alfieval, I sure hope you get some answers soon. I can't imagine how difficult that wait must be. Leaf, you've been a wealth of information giving me lots of new things to thinks about. I now feel a special connection since our diagnoses are similar. All of you have helped me get through this difficult time.  Thanks for all your kind words ladies.",
