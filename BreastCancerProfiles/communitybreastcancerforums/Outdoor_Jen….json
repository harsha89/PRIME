My doctor just started me on an annual program of a mammogram and ultrasound followed in 6 months by an MRI with and without contrast due to a high risk of breast cancer. I am 46 and have had 2 biopsies, the most recent of which came back showing usual ductal hyperplasia. My last mammogram (July 2016) came back ok, and I just had my first MRI yesterday (not fun, but at least I got it done). My mom has had a few biopsies, one of which came back as atypical ductal hyperplasia, so I am very vigilant about my overall health. I typically eat vegan until dinner, when I usually have some form of protein, such as poultry or grass-fed beef. I work out vigorously six days a week as well, and drink a lot of water. My alcohol intake is minimal, maybe 1 or 2 drinks on the weekend, and those are usually vodka with a twist of lime (no sugary mixers). I have been taking the vitamin D3 for a few years, because although I live in Florida, my levels are low due to me staying out of the sun (except for my afternoon runs outside). I am curious as to how you developed your current supplement plan. I like it! Also, where did you find decent bras without underwires? I could probably go without wearing one (since I'm like a 34AA!), but it's nice to have a little coverage. I really like the supplement idea, and while it doesn't necessarily cure everything, I do think it provides a lot of healing and good health. Take care, Jen",
