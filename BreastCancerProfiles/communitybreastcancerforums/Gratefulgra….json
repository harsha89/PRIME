So far so good with hair, but expecting it to start coming out in another week or so. I cut it short, brrrr, cold! My dr is giving me steriod pill for first 3 days, plus the compazine and ativan that helps with nausea. Praying it stays that way. My big prob is drinking water and going to the bathroom, BM are so dry and hard, boohoo. Adding prune juice this weekend, and seems to help. I am praying I can do this in 4 treatments, and get this behind me. I hope for you too! I tried to put my new wig on yesterday, that is not an easy feat for an older woman. May have to go back and have the wig ladies help me again. Anyone else have wig problems? Hope all us fighters have a pleasant Sunday today! Marilyn (aka a very Gratefulgrandma)",

My SE's are not bad, think the one bothers me the most are my cold feet. Socks and heating pad help, so I am happy w that. I finally get my shots this week to make the white blood cells, (my dr. office doesn't use the neulasta thing) so I can feel better going out. Which makes me ask please, does anyone go out in public with the masks? Or do you go bare? We are having a nasty URI going around Cali and I am afraid to go anywhere until the shots, and even then thinking masking up. Everyone looks at me funny the one time I did go into store w mask, boo hoo. Thanks! Keep faith and we will get well !",

I never would have thought the shots would be worse than the drip drip drip of chemo! My daughter comes next week, I am going to play with my wig. I like my wig, just want to make sure it looks ok. Here's to everyone feeling ok, and perhaps even better than ok!",

I guess when I went in, with a 7 cm aggressive tumor I had resigned myself to full masectomy and then heard the latest protocol is \"breast perservation\" I went into shock in a good way. And then to hear I could get the cut done first I was really happy. But all that flipped, and so now I gutted the chemo out, and off I go to surgery. I am thrilled at all the advances that have been made for BC, but still mystified of all the different treatments out there. My best to you!",

I will pop into the shop once hair all gone and have the ladies help me out. I would like to wear it, just to feel normal for a bit, but I also don't want to think I am walking around with a bad toupe lol! Margun: Not sure your question but I had every breast cancer tendency in the book. Stress, no exercise, little over weight, no vitamines, and so on, and I got it. However I don't think think there is rhyme or reason for who does. I personally believe there is something we are eating (food additives) or in the air (electronic waves). But that is just me. And most importantly is we keep good attitude during treatment to get this thing gone, adios, buh bye. PS Don't get fooled today! wink wink :-)",

Hopefully that will just be a passing thing for you. If not do mention it to the DR. I am taking Florastor Probiotics. I asked two oncologists and they both said no problem. I had a bad case of C Diff last fall from over antibiotic use due to strep throat. I went on several probiotics and it kept me from being hospitalized while waiting for diagnosis of the CDiff and I believe helps the gut in general. I am hoping it will help with the dreaded diahreah SE. Thanks to all who post here, it's so informative! I am taking much advice and anticipate the tips will help during this \"interesting\" time!

I am having my 4th and final TC infusion May 29th, then off to surgery and radiation. Seems to be never ending, and frankly I am already over it and want to be done. SE are tolerable, just tired of them and want to feel normal again. I miss going out to dinner, traveling to see my grandchildren and I repeat, just feeling normal. I did find out my original 7 cm tumor has shrunk to almost nothing, for which I am very happy about. Guess the more aggressive tumors can respond more dramatically that way. I will stop now, and again wish all of us well, and a swift return to good health, to hopefully never hear a cancer diagnosis again.",

So I got all set up with a surgery appointment and mentally ready to go. Then 5 minutes later the oncologist came in, and reversed the entire plan! Chemo first then surgery. So is sounds to me like each specilist in this field has their own take. The surgeon did say she would defer to what ever the oncologist recommended. Had my last TC chemo yesterday, the 29th. Can't wait for the SE to go bye bye. Mine were mildish but pesky. LizzieAG yes I agree it is never really over. After chemo and surgery and radiation there will always be special pills and scans that we will have to hold our breath over praying they come out clean. Sending my best to all involved with this challenge!",
