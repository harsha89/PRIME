My oncologist said she will just do blood tests now to check cancer markers. I'm so afraid of cancer coming back somewhere else that I'm wondering why I won't get full body scans, MRI's, etc. I had BMX so I don't know if I'll need mammograms or what!!! My lymph nodes were clear at the time of surgery. But ladies, every cough, every upset stomach, every headache Scares me. I start to think its spread! I'm trying not to let this type of thinking last too long, and I've come a long way, trust me. But I can't help but feel like I should be doing more as far as monitoring goes. Then again, maybe not. Maybe I can relax in knowing that my scans last year showed no cancer anywhere else. And that the surgeon woke me up and said the nodes were clear and just two were removed. Maybe I AM okay!!!! It's like I'm afraid to think that I'm cancer free. It's scarier to say that than say \"I've got breast cancer!\".  Wow, this is crazy. I'm 1 year since diagnosis and having implant exchange on 7/25. ",
