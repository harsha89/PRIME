Sentinel lymph node biospy found a 2mm micromet in one node. BS said MRI can't really dedect cancer that is under 2mm. Even with the positive node, I was not given chemo due to low oncotype score. Although the Onco test was originially only given when node negative, it is now routinely used when there are 1-3 positive nodes. However, I received radiation because of the node, so immediate construction would have been compromised. I had expanders, fills then radiation, then exchange.",

It looks for certain characteristics of the tumor, including ER, PR, her2, Ki67,and others - basically genetic characteristics of the tumor that are thought to influence recurrence. When you say \"genetic test\", are you referrirng to testing for BRCA1/2? That is a test done using your blood or saliva, not on the tumor. About reconstruction, a few things. I have seen photos of immediate reconstruction and the women looked very beat up! no way to avoid that. If you end up not needing radiation or chemo, you can have the exchange fairly quickly - just make sure to ask your PS. Each one has different policies on how long to wait. My PS said at least 6 weeks after radiation. (I waited 12 weeks). Some PS insist on at least 6 months after radiation. I understand your frustratio, especially with all the strides they have made with skin-sparing mastectomy and such in the world of plastic surgery. Come to think of it, I had my sentinel biopsy done about 5 days before my mastectomy. So I knew going into the BMX that I had a positive node. If you could do that, then you would know what other treatments would be needed and whether or not you should do immediate or expanders??",

I certainly got red and had minor itching but no peeling or blistering. I used Miaderm lotion developed by a RO - active ingredients are Calendula, aloe vera and hyaluranic acid (i think). Worked great. I also bought aloe vera gel capsules - that some people take orally, but I would puncture the capsule, and squeeze the gel out - 100% aloe. They were GNC brand. I wasn't fatigued and didn't feel ill during the treatments. The rads did have an impact on my reconstruction but everything looks OK in clothes so I am not complaining. My shoulder often gets stiff so stretching is a must. I do wonder what my body would be like if I had the full axillary lymph node dissection instead of the radiation (I think it was an option). I must say I have not had any lymphedema on the radiation side.",

There are studies out there that cover this, I am sorry that I don't have them now. They radiated the axillary nodes and the ones near the collar bone, in addition to the breast area. let me know if you want citations, i can gig them up.",

I can only say that my doctor wanted to put one in me at the time of biopsy and I said that I didn't want it. Something told me I shouldn't have that floating around in me. Doc agreed probably but I think only because she knew the biopsy was going to be positive and a mastectomy was in the cards - so the marker would come out anyways. But It worried me and it sounds like you got the worse of it. I hope you get some relief soon and some answers.",
