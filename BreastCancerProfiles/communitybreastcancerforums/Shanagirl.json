There are so many wonderful women here to help you thru this.  You are in the hardest part of your diagnosis. Although chemo is rough, it is bearable. They have so many drugs out now that prevent you from getting really sick from side effects.  You WILL get through this.  Once you visit your onc and get your treatment plan appoinments scheduled you will feel more in control. Take one day at a time.. This is not the time for YOU to be STRONG for everyone else.  Your family needs to be strong for you.  Rely on them for comfort and support, and don't feel you have to \"stay Positive\" as many people will tell you.  There are days for tears and dumping on peoples shoulders.  Another thing... stay close to the stage 3ers on this forum.  They are a wonderful group of women. Stage 3 is scarey but there is treatment for it and you have years of life ahead of you.",

After my post surgical cosultation, I asked my BS if I should have had the right breast removed also, and he felt no.  But I really wonder now.  Barb",

I was given Benedryl infusions before my treatment infusions to prevent any allergic reaction.  But I don't have any known allergies. They began the Benedryl when I started with a few hive like marks in the arm where the A was being infused.  I also want to mention that I am on Arimidex and have noticed a lot more joint pain since starting it in November.

I'm sorry I haven't checked in for a few days.  I went to the dentist for some periodontal work done.  He is a beast. I've never gone to someone who is so rough and heartless with giving a needle.  I've had babies, dental work and needles and breast cancer surgery, but this guy left me in tears crying like a baby in the chair after he jammed the needle into my mouth.  I am so afraid to go back next week.  What a butcher.  I guess I've always been spoiled by gentle dentists who gave gradual needles very slowly.  But this was a nightmare before I was numbed.  I also went to the orthopedist to discuss results of my knee MRI.  I was in so much pain all week and my leg swelled up from my knee to my ankle.  Apparently the popleteal cyst ruptured and was draining which caused all the pain and swelling.They explained to me that the symptoms it causes present as a blood clot but MRI showed only the cyst draining into surrounding muscle and tissues.  It will be a good 6 weeks they said before I can walk comfortably and swell goes down.  The doc prescribed a \"leg sleeve\" for the swelling\". I guess it's the same principal as for lympedema swelling in the arm.  So that's all the excitement for the week.  Truthfully I actually went to the beach yesterday with my cane and sat in the sand chair by the surf and just meditated and prayed.  Very cleansing.  Thank you all my stage III sisters.

The article was in \"Prevention\" magazine.  I began taking it for premenstrual swelling back than and it worked great.  I continued taking it during my pregnancy with our third child who was due to be born in August.  That pregancy was the first that I didn't have swollen ankles and fingers and a round moon face from the swelling.  I have continued to take it every night at bed time for the last 20 years or so, and it really does help.  I notice that if I forget to take it I do feel a little more swollen the next day.  It has to be 300 mgs though.  It also prevented nausea from my pregnancies, and may have helped me from getting too puffy from the steroids during chemo.  So maybe it could help a little with your arm swelling.

I'm sorry you had to go thru what you went thru. I do believe that just as a person can become diabetic, or have cancer, or other diseases and must be treated by a doctor to treat with appropriate medication, we also need to be treated by a doctor who is knowledgable about mental diseases that result from chemical changes in brain.  I was treated with medications prescribed by a pharmachological Psychiatrist, to treat the chemical reactions by cortisol in my brain that caused the depression and PTSD.  I also had cognitive therapy to help me learn how to manage the stressors that triggered the stress cortisol reaction.  It was a process in my journey in life and I survived it all, just as I survived the coma from the brain hemorrage and the breast cancer.  I haven't been here on this forum in awhile, but was just stopping in to say hi and saw your post.

It's not something you ever wanted to research or become knowledgable in previously.  Two things to remember.  Get a copy of your pathology report from your first diagnosis and find out the ER and PR status of your cancer.

The thing is that with PTSD, you can have the most beautiful home, strong marriage, and wonderful kids, but even so the symptoms can persist inside.  Then came the bankruptcy DH had to file after losing his business. The day before was the cancer diagnosis.  So in the year of diagnosis surgery and treatment, DH and I faced bankruptcy, breast cancer, loss of our beautiful home we raised our children in, and a difficult move to a smaller rental home.  This year was a tremendous year of loss of two things a women holds dear.  Her breasts and her home. It is very painful to even type about it let alone speak about it.  Dealing with the breast cancer has been that much harder.   Thanks, for listening.

I used to love to put my face against my mare's cheek, and breath in her scent, which was uniquely hers, and feel the soft velvet of her nose.  I miss grooming and tacking her up and the business of the barn, cleaning my tack, riding the post, and cantering easily with her in a 20 meter circle with my trainer  during a lesson in the indoor ring.  I would give anything to experience the sheer exhilaration of it again.

This continued while they were in high school, and during that time I was riding my horse a lot and somehow the running gave way to riding.  For several years I would go to the barn every day like I was going to work, and put on my riding \"uniform\" and the payback was the feeling I got while riding. To make a long story short that was all pre menopause, and pre breast cancer.  I will turn 61 next month, and at this point am fearful to take up running again.  My left knee is not good and I don't want to cause an injury.  I often wonder if my knee issue is from the runninng and riding I did in my yournger days.  I have always looked and acted very young for my age, and if I could I would start running again and just push threw my issues.  I'm not consistant with continuously working out, and this long winter has really given me cabin fever.  When I used to run, I'd be out in below 0 weather.  Keep running, Mary.  I know if I were able to run like you I would definitely feel like I was literally running away from a recurrence.

We know there is no cure but we remain hopeful that we can continue NED for many long years.  I finished rads in November and I heard everyone saying \"it's over now\", and yet for me another phase had begun.  The continuing side effects, new medications, more appts with my onc for followup after care, and the fear of it coming back again.  But I don't talk about it with anyone but my husband.  He is the only one who really knows and understands this.  You will begin to feel better and find a new kind of normal.  Stay close to us here and you will learn alot about yourself and what you can expect and how to endure the rough days.

No, He probably was not. The hills would have been bitterly cold and snow covered in December. The Watchtower once recommended, \"The event is so important that it is always appropriate to call it to the minds of the people, regardless of the date \" (Watchtower-Dec. 15, 1926, P. 371). The Early Church originally celebrated his birth on Jan.6. The eastern Orthodox still hold to this date. We do know the date of Lincoln's birthday; yet we often celebrate on a different day since it is the memory not the exact date being emphasized. Col. 2:14-17 \" So let no one judge you in food or in drink, or regarding a festival regarding a festival or a new moon or Sabbaths. \"Rom. 14:5-6 \", One person esteems one day above another; another esteems every day alike. Let each be fully convinced in his own mind. He who observes the day, observes it to the Lord;\"  If someone wants to set a certain day aside he has the liberty and right to do so.  It can be any day of the week, however if he makes it a requirement for others to have to do the same then he has become legalistic and is no longer operating in grace, he has become a judge of his brother without any Biblical substantiation.  In the same manner if someone makes it illegal to celebrate it they are a legalist. Scripture does not forbid celebrating the birth of Christ. Jesus was at \"the Feast of the Dedication\" in John 10:22. This was not an official Holy day. Yet we do not find that Jesus refusing to participate in the celebration, he actually condones it and this was on Dec.25.  Does this mean Jesus is practicing paganism?  While we are not specifically commanded to celebrate Jesus' birthday, we are not brought into bondage by it either. By practicing the freedom in the NT we can remember the time the savior visited our earth. Does Scripture forbid celebrating Jesus' birth ? The Watchtower says there is no command to celebrate his birth in scripture like remembering his death! There is no command not to either. There is no command to meet on Sundays but we do out of our freedom to worship. This is something they changed their mind on over the years \"Don't quibble about the date; join in with the world and celebrate Christmas (WT 12/1 1904 p.3468).  \"Christmas is so important, regardless of the date.\" (WT 12/15/1926 p.371)  \"It is quite immaterial the day Christmas is celebrated; we may properly join. (WT 12/15/1903 p.3290) They state, \"We are to remember Jesus' death not his birth. \"While the emphasis of forgiveness is on his death we should be thankful he became a man. Who set the precedent for our response to His birth? Lets take a look at Luke 2:8-14 and you find it was the inhabitants of Heaven, the angels! Jehovah definitely approved of celebrating the birth of Christ. Opposition only came from the kingdom of Satan. We read, Jesus' birth is characterized by \"the glory of the Lord\" and \"great joy! \" For who? 'All people!\" A multitude of heavenly host\" was joyous with celebration and praise! Do you suppose the shepherds said, \"Oh, I just don't see what all those angels are excited about\"?   They joined Heaven and celebrated the birth of Christ, they were excited!   Herod didn't celebrate his birth because the promise of God was born, he wanted him dead. (He asked The wise men who came to bring him gifts and worship him to report back so he might do 'fake' worship of him Mt.2:9-11) What about the pagan origins of the Christmas tree? Consider the pagan origin of the word \"December\" written on the front of every Watchtower magazine this month. What about the names of the week being of pagan origin (Saturday =Saturn) Is the Watchtower pagan simply for mixing a word of pagan origin with its religion?  Watchtower readers would say no. The Watchtower is not recommending the worship of Greek gods by using something common to both cultures. For the Watchtower to be consistent they would have to remove the words of the weeks and months from their publications. Do Christians attach Pagan meanings to the tree today?   No, not anymore than the J.W.'s do! What about the Old Testament references of the heathen  decorating a tree ? Read the context of those Old Testament passages. The person was making an idol to worship. They built buildings for idol worship, should we no longer go into buildings ? They sacrificed foods to Idols, should we discontinue eating? To say people who enjoy Christmas worship Christmas trees is simply  not being honest! Christians do not worship the cross on a building or a tree in their living rooms. Do Christians attach pagan meanings to lights or other decorations?  No. Of course not! Rather, lights remind God's people about Jesus! Jesus said, \"I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life\" John 8:12. The real problems of Christmas are the commercialism which removes the focus from the Lord to the exultation of mythology (Santa Claus versus the Lord).  Satan will use the commercialism and fantasy about Santa Claus to keep people from the real meaning of Christ's birth.  So do J.W's by the material that they print, making Christ a creature and ignore the incarnation of God visiting man. Should we be giving Jesus such praise? Remember how He commended the children who praised Him, saying the stones would cry out if they stopped.\" (Luke 19:3 7-40) When was the last time you heard someone from the Kingdom Hall praise Jesus? If Jesus does not receive worshipful honor, equal to the Father, your honor of the Father is not accepted (John 5:23). From the beginning people \"worshipped him \" (Matthew 3:1 1), not \"him and her\" (Mary) as Roman Catholicism does. Was Jesus worshipped by His disciples, or does the Watchtower Bible accurately suggest otherwise?  Test those Bibles by the Greek. See how the Watchtower translates the following verses, then compare the Greek spellings (Rev. 22:8 with Mark 2:2), (Rev. 5:14 with Mat. 2:1 1; 14:33; 28:9,17), and (Heb. 11:21 with Mark 5:6 and John 9:38). The exact worship the Father receives, the Son also receives. Isaiah called the Christ child, the 'Mighty God\" (Isaiah 9:6). He goes on to write the mighty God is Jehovah the LORD (Isaiah 10:20). Mt1:23 Emmanuel \"The God with us.\"    What about gift-giving? Good-will to all men is commended! Under the former light Judge Rutherford, the Watchtower president at the time, was very excited about his \"numerous Christmas presents\" \" (Watchtower-Jan. 15, 1919, P. 3 1).According to their own judgment he was a pagan! Did not the wise men bring expensive gifts to Jesus Mt.2:1.  How wise are you? Would a J.W. turn down a gift on any other day of the year? If you were at work and thirsty and someone bought you a drink for free isn't that a gift?  If someone bought you a meal isn't that a gift?  If gift-giving is acceptable on other days of the year, why not on December 25th ? God's only condition for celebrating is do so \"unto the Lord\" (Rom. 14:5,6).   Christmas maybe your stumbling-block, but for Christians, it is a stepping-stone to share the real meaning. Using any Opportunity to point people to Jesus Christ. The light of the Watchtower may change, but the Light of the world (Jesus Christ and his word) is never changing. What is the best gift? The best gift you can give to God is yourself.  He has already given his best gift to all the world almost 2,000 years ago. Salvation is his free gift to you through his Son not an organization. \"The gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.\" (Rom. 6:23 ). No one reaches for their wallet to pay off a free gift! You, simply receive him (Rom. 4:4; 11:6; Gal. 3:24). What about \"Working hard for the reward of eternal life\" (Watchtower--April 15, 1972, P. 491). Eternal life is not a reward which must be earned by works. The Bible tells us salvation is a free gift! \"For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God.' not of works, lest any man should boast.\" (Eph.2:8,9). See, it is not by works, God is trying to keep you from boasting. Accept God's gift, Jesus! but as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name\" (John 1: 12). Rom.3:26-28\" To demonstrate at the present time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believes in Jesus.   Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? No: but by the law of faith.   Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.\" Rom.11:6 And if by grace then it is no longer of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace. but if it is by works, it is no longer grace; otherwise work is no longer work.\" Are you willing to receive what God has given? How do you receive?",

Unfortunately, I've come down with a horrendous cold and cough, and have been going thru so much kleenex and haven't felt up to trying it out with DH.  Now he's coming down with it and is feeling totally miserable with it, so a few more days on the Vagifem and lube can only make it better when we're over this cold virus  Barb",

Can you imagine how very cold and dark blackeness overtook the land for long periods of time, and when the sun began to give warmth to them again after a season of cold darkness, it must have felt like a blessing from God to have the sun shine again, and renewal of the land again.  Festivals to celebrate life, and prosperity again.  To me it seems only fitting that the birth of the Messiah which is celebrated at the time of the Hebrew calender Keslev 25 of Hannukah the festival of dedication and to the temple. Festival of lights. The light that Christians await the Messiah to shine on all mankind .  The temple in Jerusalem was desacrated and thousands of jews perished at the destruction.  Hanukkah is an important feast for the Jewish people, for it reminds them of how God miraculously delivered their ancestors when they were persecuted.   I love this time of year of giving thanks to God, giving to one another in good and charitable ways in the spirit of what the teachings of Christ are about, and living life anew i a spirit of compassion for others, being the best we can be with our own fellow human beings even if they don't happen to be in our own church communiy.  That's what thias season is about.

Click here: Barbara Ehrenreich, author of Bait and Switch  Does anyone else have trouble with the term 'survivor'?' I ask, and, surprisingly, two or three speak up. It could be \"unlucky,\" one tells me; it \"tempts fate,\" says another, shuddering slightly. After all, the cancer can recur at any time, either in the breast or in some more strategic site. No one brings up my own objection to the term, though: that the mindless triumphalism of \"survivorhood\" denigrates the dead and the dying. Did we who live \"fight\" harder than those who've died? Can we claim to be \"braver,\" better, people than the dead?

I guess that's why I've had such an issue with what happens to our sex lives after BC.  I'm glad you got a prescription for the Vagifem.  Take it as directed and don't do what I did by skipping doses because I had no desire.  I let too much time go by without taking it, it really made the vaginal atrophy symptoms severe.  I've been taking the Vagifem regularly now and also with the replens and have noticed I feel more normal now.  Though I don't have the strong sexual desire I had before, I do feel more aroused when DH gets me going. This is all with the help of plenty of lube just prior to starting lovemaking and also the little poket rocket vibrator that DH helps with the \"O\"s.  After all this, intercourse is good, and sometimes even an extra \"O\" during.  As for the progesterone creme, I'm hoping to ask my gyn next time I see her, if it's ok.  She used to prescribe it when I was in perimenopause before BC.  It did help quite a bit.  It was a  bioidentical creme applied to the outside of the labia.  The creme was compounded at a compound pharmacy and came in long thin applicators.  I hope someone else comes here and gives more info about it.

Rather than just giving the history of these celebrations, it comes out and suggests that you should \"take a stand\" against the celebration.  I have the impression that those who choose to celebrate their traditions are judged by some as \"offending God\".  To me it's just overjudgmental self-righteousness when these statements are being made towards those who may choose to celebrate the Season.

I would check out the well known oncologists associated with your hospital or a good teaching hospital, or cancer treatment center in you area.  Then I would make a phone call to line up an appt. and make sure that particualr onc is covered by your ins.  Then make sure you get all of your records forwarded to this dr.  And if you get to go to your appt. trust your gut.  Persoanllly I would have felt better if my onc did scans before doing chemo, so thay can be done sometime after finsihing chemo.  I would also talk to the onc about treating with radiation even if it only made it to 1 node.  Radiation after chemo is kind of a little insurance policy in catching any little cancer buggers that escaped into other nodes.  I would want the second opinion to treat me aggressively.",

Mortal agony all night long so DH took me to emergency room this morning. I thought I might have a blood clot or something deep in my vein,  They exrayed me and did doplar ultrasound.  IT turned out to be a \"baker cyst' he said the size of a lime in back of my knee. They sent me home with a soft support cast and a cane  The doc told me to follow up with ortho tomorrow for possible artherscopic surgery, and physical therapy.  I knew all summer the joint pain in my hip and knee were very painful, but since going off the tomoxifen and seeing a chiropractor, my hip pain has been resolving, and I've been feeling so good about it and getting back into walking, even though my knee has been having issues all summer.

BC is the gift that just keeps on giving Second,  Of course you're friggin tired!!!  You just finished chemo and not even started rads yet!!  WTF, don't worry about not feeling that you WANT to exercise. Eventually you will!  I was the same way and still am and I finished rads in November. Still so friggin tired and still weak, especially when I push my ass to exercise.  I had gotten so down on myself about this that I couldn't even feel comfortable about sharing my efforts to exercise on the fitness threads.  I just quietly go at my own pace now and am happy for any little improvement I make.  To be honest, I get so frustrated at myself when I read how a lot of the other girls are doing these amazing things with their workouts, and I'm not physically up to it yet. Third, try some stretching of your arm while your laying around and watching TV.  I'm glad I did while I was recovering because it get's worse after rads as far as the tightness and tugging feeling.  Fourth,  reading everything you said so reminds me of how I am feeling physically too Hugs, Barb",

My my whole point in mentioning this is that when life deals us a blow like this, as we all know here, we become strong, very strong but we don't realize how strong until after we have gone thru it. When I came out of my 3 day coma after the brain hemorrhage, and had no deficits, everyone close to me were totally amazed that I was walking and talking with no issues with seeing or swallowing, or speaking , breathing and eating. I remember even while in the coma, I was thinking I wanted to do all those things but could not open my eyes and wake up, or even flinch and react to doctors pricking me with pins to check my reflexes while in the coma. It's amazing, but now I know why people say to talk to someone while they are in a coma, because I heard everything, and thought to myself, shit, I hear everythig they are saying but my eyes won't open and my body is not moving. When I finally recovered from all of it I laughingly would joke to people about my coma and sleep would have been such an easy way to pass on, but with my luck I'll probably suffer for years with a painful incurrable disease!

      "Content": "Shanagirl wrote: Has anyone gone thru this?  For the last few weeks I've been really suffering in a lot of Pain and swelling from the Popeliteal Cyst deep in the back of my knee. Initially the pain was so bad I could not stand on it at all, let alone take some steps to walk.  So they gave me a leg brace to wear and gave me the choice of wearing a cane or crutches.  I chose the cane.  The swelling started soon after the first visit with the Ortho.  He put me on 600 mg Ibuprophen and Vicodin to take as needed. I am usually a very active type person, and so I went where i needed to go with my brace and cane, even though I could't go faster than a snail, I had still been getting to the beach to sit in my sand chair by the surf for 2 or 4 hours each day.  Stand around the kitchen with my cane cooking dinner for me and DH and any of the kids who stopped by.  Last week the pain became so unbearable I wanted to cry.  No matter what I did, keeping off my feet with my leg raised and a heating pad, No longer doing the downstairs to feed the dogs. Going downstairs was torture.  Saw my Ortho again and she looked at the leg and noticed the swelling. She told me the swelling with this condition presents as a deep thrombosis blood clot in pain and symptoms, which was why I'm feeling so bad.  My leg looks like a lymphadema elephant leg with no ankle, just swelling, down to my toes.  And it hurts just to touch it.  My calf feels like a knife was cut into it.  The ortho said the pain and swelling is because the cyst had ruptured and spilled fluid into the surrounding nerves and tissues.  This is supposedly normal and will get better within 6 weeks.  She gave me a prescription for a leg sleeve.  They said sometimes they have to go in and remove the cyst if it keeps enlarging as mine was already a size of a lime., But they don't' like to do it becuase it can be dangerous without ultrasound and florascope to be able to maneuver around the tendons and nerves and bloodvessles.  So, I guess until it drains completely on it's own I'm going to be feeling like this for the rest of the weekend.  I was supposed to walk for the Alzheimers' walkathon tomorrow in Point Pleasant Beach NJ.  One good thing about this leg issue is that it totally took my mind off the BC.

I live with how brand new all this is and waiting for something next to happen.  Arimidex is causing new problems for me too. but I don't want to join that thread.  I feel out of place joining the fitness theads because I am just so weak and achy still, I have no stamina and endurance.  I hate the skin I am in right now.  I don't even know myself when I look in the mirror.  I went from having a good figure that over the years fluctuated between size 4 to 6.  I've always been active and working out varying from running, horse jumping, fast walking, extensive gardening etc.  That all changed.  This past summer I went to looking at a bald, bloated exhausted women.  Now I have hair that's grown an inch and it looks like an old women who''s had a perm because it's so curley.  It won't take any highlights because of the chemo so i don't have the long sleek blonde shoulder length hair anymore.  The worst thing is that I've gained about 35 lbs since diagnosis and I can't stand how it feels on me.  I look like a blob with a scarred blob boob, and I can't get my ass in my jeans comfortably anymore.  So I've started fast walking a mile and half every day.  That's alright but the weather here at the beach has been so cold and windy I can't get out every day, so I started doing cardio sculpting, and strength training with a DVD.  That sucks, but I did it today and feel so exhausted and weak.   Between being depressed over body image and fear of recurrance and not trusting my body anymore, and hating the comments I hear from people who have no clue about B C I wanted to rant about it here..  Stage 3 sucks and I went for my first mammo last week on the remaining breast,  that really sucks too. So if there are any other Stage 3ers out there who have issues they are dealing with here's the place to come.

I really think the Replens used nightly before going to bed whether or not you have sex is the key to getting those vaginal tissues plumped back up. The Vagifem a couple times a week I think works better this way for me.  Barb",

This whole BC thingy is just so all consuming on many days, but really, the last week or so I have actually focused on being hopeful since I've been feeling pretty good and progressing with the PT for my knee recovery.  Getting out and walking again has helped me in this regard.  The only thing I can do is focus on my inner knowing that all will be ok and all will be well,.................Hopefully  Barb",

But now I'm done.  I should be joyful especially with the holidays coming, but I'm scared sh%t.  This whole breast cancer journey has been so all consuming and overwhelming, and yet I have embraced the whole experience.  The what happens next is in my mind. And how can I deal with friends and family members who will see it as \"well now your cured so get on with life\"  I don't feel cured. I feel as if there is a little seed somewhere waiting to sprout either in my bones or liver , lung or brain.  I don't trust this breast cancer beast at all, and right now I am so very tired and warn out from all the treatment.  I don't feel like the person I was before it all.  I don't look like that person anymore.  Has anyone else gone thru this?
