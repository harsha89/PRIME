    "Content": "2mom wrote: I may come off as being a bit paranoid, but I'm just concerned. A few months ago a found a lump in my breast, days after a digital mamo which later showed nothing. My gyn sent me for a sono of the breast, they had to do another mamo which showed nothing. The Doc who did the sono could feel the lump, the sono showed irregular mass inside another mass of tissue( i have very densed breast). Because of the shape and family hx he did core needle biopsy(mom died of breast cancer,and 2 aunt with BC, 1 also has ovarian can.) The biopsy they say only saw normal breast tissue. the doc who did the sono and biopsy sent me for a MRI, the MRI showed nothing. the lump is still there inside the mass of fibros tissue, I've felt a new lump, i don't know what to do or think. I've done just about everything but i have an uneasy feeling. maybe my mind. How likely is it for sono guided core biopy to miss the mass and hit the fibrous tissues that entangles it?Â  Thanks for your patience. Log in to post a reply",
