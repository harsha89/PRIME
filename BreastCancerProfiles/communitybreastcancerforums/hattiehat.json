      "Content": "hattiehat wrote: hi there, I am a 29 year old from the UK a few weeks ago I noticed when I raised my left arm that an indentation appeared on my left breast. I couldn't feel an obvious lump. Saw the GP who also couldn't feel anything and refered me to breast clinic appointment for this Thursday. I think after lots of feeling around I can feel like a super thin thread like cord there, but only when arm raised not at rest. To be honest I am pretty scared, the whole presentation for me is very suspicious. The wait is really unsettling :-( anybody else similar symptoms? X Log in to post a reply",
