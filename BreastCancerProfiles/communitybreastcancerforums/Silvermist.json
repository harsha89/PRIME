Over the summer I was birads 3 from an mri - an area 7mm. My dr wanted to check again in 6 mos. I went back Monday. MRI found it to be 9mm, birads 4. Had a core needle biopsy yesterday (Thursday). Was MUCH less painful than I anticipated. Now I wait....the dr thinks I will be called Monday or Tuesday. Trying not to freak out.... Log in to post a reply",

But she also stressed it is still small. It is back neAr my chest wall, so can not be felt. I had no tranquilizers. I just looked away the whole time- I did not want to see the needle. I had an ultrasound mri. Wednesday, huh? The nurse called today to check on me- I saw the # and thought it was results- nope, just to see how I am feeling. Everyone was really nice- but I just want to know. I am thinking good thoughts for you.",
