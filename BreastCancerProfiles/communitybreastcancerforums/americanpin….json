      "Content": "Feb 6, 2011 10:46PM - edited Feb 6, 2011 10:59PM by americanpinay Hi Kathleen, I love and trust my onc and would probably agree to whatever he recommends for my follow up care. Having said that, I sometimes think that he is on the aggresive side of things. My insurance is probably NOT loving him. Based on what I have read on this board, some oncs do not recommend anything, not even blood tests, unless there are symptoms. I also read somewhere that intensive follow up care do not improve survival and that early detection does not apply to mets. I, for the life of me, cannot get my head around that. I somehow think that finding mets early would and should help. Don't cancer cells go amok (for lack of a better term) when left untreated? One thing is for sure, I will continue to have an internal debate about whether these tests are worth it. BTW, my rad onc is on the less agressive side of things. He was very respectful of the other onc's opinion but did wonder out loud why a PET scan was recommended after treatment. I wish you luck in your appointment and I hope that you'd be able to trust the type of follow up care that you decide on.  Take care. Lumpectomy 09/08, AC x 4 then Taxol x 12 10/08 through 03/09, Rads x 33 05/09 through 06/09 Tamoxifen beg 08/09 Diagnosis: 9/10/2008, IDC, 3cm, Stage IIIa, Grade 2, 4/6 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2-",

About your scan question, it looks like you had a PET before treatment and it showed some activity on your lymph nodes, is that correct? Then I would do another PET because I would want to know that treatment took care of those areas of concern. Just keep in mind that tests beget tests. I should know as I had a whole bunch of scans recently. What I had learned from this experience is that scan results can't really give me the peace of mind I'd like to have. Going forward, I have to think of tests or scans as things I have to do to make sure that, if there is something going on, it could be taken care of ASAP. Good luck with your decision. Take care. ",

The most I've ever done in so far as looking at the actual scans is that I once glanced at the screen on my way out. I shuddered and walked away real fast.

If I remember correctly, I read that neoadjuvant chemo is not prescribed as often as adjuvant chemo.  I believe neoadjuvant chemo is commonly prescribed for IBC or if the doctor wants to shrink a huge tumor before surgery.
