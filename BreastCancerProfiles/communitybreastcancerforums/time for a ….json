    "Content": "3 hours ago time-for-a-cure wrote: Hello Everyone - my story is similar to others on this site. I was first dx in Dec 2012 and had surgery in early 2013. The surgeon had difficulty getting margins, so after two attempts, I started chemo, then had a third and definitive surgery after chemo. I was node negative, no others sign of disease. I then had radiation and started arimidex. After 15 months on arimidex, i had a huge Supraclavicualr node (on the opposite side) that bx positive for breast ca. After a couple rounds of abraxane, I went on femara and ibrance. I had a very positive response, with the node quickly shrinking. I then had the node removed and radiation to the site. There was no evidence of active cancer in the node when it was removed.In summary Iwas treated quite aggressively. I have been on Ibrance for over 4 years. The questions are 1) do i still need the Ibrance? 2) should i go Down to just hormanals? 3) is there a time of being NED, after which you don\u2019t t need treatment. Any one else in a similar situations? Any other thoughts? Thanks. Kitt",
