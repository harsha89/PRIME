Plus the anaesthetist was incredibly good looking (lol).  Definitely a nice face to fall asleep too.  But waking up to my amazing husband's was even better.  Everyone at the hospital was so kind, respected my wishes about my diabetes care, and gave me my own room.  My pre-op nurses even came to see me before I left just to see that I was OK. Now I'm home with my dear dear husband who took off my dressings so gently today and empties my 3 drains as needed while tending our 4 year-old and doing the household chores.  I am very very blessed.  I have always been grateful for my life, but now I see all the love around me that I have always questioned because I didn't love myself enough.  I love my life, I love my body and I love every one of you that sent your words winging across the world when I was paralyzed by fear.  Thanks again, sisters.  I recommend \"Sounds of Healing\", an album by Jonathan Goldman (grab it off iTunes), to anyone going through and recovering from diagnosis and surgery.  I even wear my little iPod to sleep and it is SO relaxing.  Not my normal choice of tunes, but just right for now.  Erin",
