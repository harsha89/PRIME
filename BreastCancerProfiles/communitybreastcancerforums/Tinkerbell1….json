Well I should say I still have a little discomfort but the real pain was short lived thankfully. I finished rad treatments about 4 months ago. It\u2019s so frustrating when the docs don\u2019t find a reason for our issues. I hope you\u2019re pain is temporary. Maybe a stress or hairline fracture not visible on X-ray?? Hope it resolves itself and you are feeling better soon. Take good care",
