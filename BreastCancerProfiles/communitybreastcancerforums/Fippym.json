I have tried to show them strength and positive attitude during my whole journey but have to admit I have had a few \"meltdowns\" along the way also. Probably the best compliment I could have gotten was when my 16 year old told me a song on the radio made her think of me whenever she heard it. The song was Stronger by Kelly Clarkson. When I asked why she thought of me....she said because you have been so strong through all that has happened. I wanted to cry. I felt so happy that she could see what I was going through. Sometimes with teenagers that doesn't happen! Haha!! Stay strong but know it's normal to have bad days too. Best wishes to you.",
