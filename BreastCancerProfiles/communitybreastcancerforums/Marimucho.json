I can tell you this, once I got answers, I found it much easier to deal with than not knowing. On the other hand, knowledge is like opening up a can of worms. The more you learn, the more questions you might have. The good thing is it is important to be informed, and breastcancer.org is a great place to get answers and find incredible support. I have found so much help here, and although I need to always get my doctor's professional advice, between now and then, I will continue to reach out to this community of brave, strong and knowledgeable women touched by breast cancer. What I would like to share with you is that I have had discomfort in my left groin area since I was diagnosed on December 3. My breast tumor is also on my left side. The groin pain got worse. Everyone says it is my head. I know it is not. My breast surgeon said that those lymph nodes would not be connected to my breast tumor. Not to worry about it yet. Well, for about three days the pain and discomfort is not so bad; however, I now feel a swollen tiny lump and I know it is a lymph node. It is a little lower than where the original discomfort was. It is on the inner thigh. So now I am, of course, wondering what it is. I am scared too. I feel the surgeon will think I am crazy when I call his office on Monday. But then I know I have a right to, and so do you. I won't have my bilateral mastectomy until January 6, and that seems like a long, long time. Waiting and waiting is so hard. It's okay to be scared. We can be scared together. Marimucho",

Gee...I don't blame you for feeling overwhelmed and anxious. I am happy to know that an effort was made to make things better for you when you have the port taken out. The whole idea of the port insertion and removal really scares me. But, I am willing and ready if I have to. We will see. If you don't mind me asking, do you have an idea as to why I would or would not get chemotherapy? I think my tumor is like yours. Mine is on the left breast, ER+/PR+, HER2- It is 2.5 or 2.9. I got a 2.9 measurement on the sonogram and 2.5 on the MRI. No lymphatic invasion identified, yet. My surgery is January 7...unilateral mastectomy. I was told that I will not need radiation. But have read many posts where chemotherapy is not part of treatment for the same diagnosis. I know each case is different, history for example, makes a difference. I see that if a lumpectomy is involved, then more treatments include chemo, but otherwise, very few treatments with chemo when mastectomy surgery occurs. I know I could not have a lumpectomy. The idea of no radiation and no chemotherapy makes me very uneasy. I hope your next days are bright with the port removal procedure behind you. Looking forward to hearing from you. ",

I wish I could take some of it for you. Still, I am so happy your port is out. It seems like such a wonderful place to be from the outside looking in. Yet your pain is real and I hope it gets better. Thanks for sharing about your cancer. So far, everything seems to be alike for our tumors. I will have the double mastectomy on January 6. I am not sure how they already know I don't need any preadjuvant chemotherapy as well as radiation down the road. My reconstruction will be done on Jan 6 also, and I will be having expanders put in. I hope I am a candidate for the Ocotype and Mammaprint testing. It is interesting that I am really hoping for chemotherapy. I know it is just a misconception of mine. I have learned that chemotherapy can also work against your chances for lowering your recurrence rate. I am willing to do the worst of things if it will help me. Maybe my doctors need to spend more time explaining things to me. For now, thank goodness for all of you and breastcancer.org I hope you are having a nice day. When you can, post an update. I would love to know how you are feeling. Take care, Marimucho",
