The TNBC went from 1.5-2cm on 3/17 to 7cm 4/5. I was adamant about getting the mastectomy right away and was scheduled for 4/12. Saw Medical Oncologist today (thursday) and they want to take me through 12 weeks of chemo. I feel like i'm being used as a lab monkey and this will take me well past the 90 'safe' period. Each time I talk to these people they bring me back to the same place! Now i feel so trapped. I'm now too afraid not to follow their plans. I want to scream. I did. I can't even force them to do the double mastectomy! I feel boxed in. Helpless. my doctor said this is what she would do if it were her. But this is me. What the heck is happening? I can't even advocate for myself and get the response I've demanded. I was told they would do the double mastectomy on tues, now I'm told the safest and best chance I have is to shrink the tumor first and then have the surgery. 12 MORE WEEKS??? How much danger am I in? well I think I'm close to doomed. I don't know what to do or who to believe or how to get a straight answer. The answer was, if we don't get it all out then you have to wait until we can start the chemo and the cancer can spread through your body. Its so aggressive we want to chemo first. But I'm not even a candidate for radiation because of scleroderma. Somebody please help me, I'm all I got to advocate with and I don't believe I'm being listened to. And if I say No and get denied any treatment or involvement...Is 'What if we don't get all the tumor out? And \"I didn't cancel your first surgery date' as a way of telling me this is my fault because I wanted a second opinion first? Twenty days of delay is a problem but now they want to delay 12 more weeks. What am I not understanding? I want to live past this. What am I not getting through to my thick skull? Why do I feel its for the doctor's convenience to shrink the tumor and not to save my life? What is wrong with me?????",

I didn't know they'd be here or that anyone would have read my 'desperate' whine. Woke up and had a screaming-mimi fit at my husband who took it and could only respond after I pulled it out of him 'I'm scared'. That brought it to a close. My moods are all over the place and then some. I'm very grateful to all of you and especially for the explanation of the tissue being cut and chemo being unable to get to the cells. Thank you. I feel more hopeful after a night and day of asking \"Why?' I even looked up TNBC as holy punishment and saw how 'not' that was at a great online site. I don't go to support groups, this is hard to talk about in person to anyone outside my immediate family. I actually feel somewhat embarrassed. And my life seems so strange, different. Okay, this has helped a great deal...I'll go through with the Port Catheter surgery on Tues and then the Chemo begins on Friday. Here is my only outlet. TNBC is very very frightening. Before coming to the post I read about some new therapy call PARP, just FYI. Thanks guys, this will help me get through the weekend.",

      "Content": "Mar 25, 2016 03:11PM - edited Mar 25, 2016 03:13PM by okay1 Just found you guys. I'm scared and unhappy. I keep thinking, of all the problems now this! So, I just decided to look for women like me and to get positive from their stories and support. I don't know if changing my diet will do any good because I'm already a vegetarian nearly 20 years. I stopped sugar 4 years ago but I really wonder if there's a link between Truvia and breast cancer or Truvia, soy food and breast cancer. I have to say, its been weighing on my mind. Plus I have CREST. Whoopie. Someone told me to watch funny films and read funny stories. I was diagnosed in Feb, seen JohnsHopkins/Columbia Presbyterian doctors for second opinion. One was a medical oncologist who explained to me the difference between an actual medical oncologist and a breast surgeon in oncology. Really opened my eyes! Waiting for surgery. I'm 64 and this is no where in my family! That's whats so upsetting and scary. Did Genetic Testing this past week, waiting for the results. They already know I'm TNBC. Why am I so scared? Why do I break into wailing (smile), its true. I already know why. I'm am so very happy to have found this board. I felt so alone. Then after I Googled TNBC and read all the dire and disheartening reports, I thought I'd keel over. Warning, if you've not read them, DON'T! They are QN (quadruple negative). Guys I am so happy to find you all here. Thank you for the encouragement. I'll be here, most likely, every day! I'm going back and start at the first topic and work my way through!",
