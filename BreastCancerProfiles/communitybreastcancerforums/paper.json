    "Content": "paper wrote: Hello! I looked through all of the wonderful posts on symptoms before dx, but I couldn't find my exact ones and would love advice. I have one breast that is increasing in size, has a painful spot under my nipple, and is losing nipple sensitivity, but no lump. My CBE was normal, and I have an appointment for a mammo/US. I thought it was a cyst or a benign lump, but obviously nothing can be felt. So my questions are: Have any of you had these symptoms with no lump? How far should I pursue the issue? I know many of you say to not let it drop, so what kinds of things should I be aware of/ask for in order to be a good advocate for myself? Any resources would be appreciated. Log in to post a reply",
