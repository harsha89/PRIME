All I have heard from doctors since Feb is \"wear a sports bra, dont use caffiene and take ibuprophen\". (All of those I have done since I was a teen!) I will keep you posted and thanks again!",

I have found a clinic in my area (womens clinic). My plans are to call them tomorrow and schedule an appointment. I am tired of the run around the other doctors have given me and I plan to go to this appointment (if they accept my insurance) and I am not taking my records from previous doctors. I plan to start over and say here my boob is, do something about it. I am tired of the sleepless nights and lazy doctors who only base their diagnosis on your medical records rather than listening to me and offering other tests or solutions. I have noticed today that on this same breast it looks like little needle pokes all around my breast..from the outer part where lump is clear to the underside where the two dimples are.

No doctors have made orders for MRI, biopsy or labs (other than hormone levels and thyroid which all checked out great). I will be requesting one at my next appt tho you can bet  on that. I went to a very nice GYN and she said my right breast did not appear normal, she then sent me to a breast surgeon, he ordered an ultrasound to check for abnormal cysts to aspirate. none were found at that time so thats all the farther that went. The last doctor I did see told me the lump was a part of my breast? well my left breast didnt feel that way!..I have bad pain under my nipple today ugh! When my breast isnt experiencing sharp stabbing pains, it is a deep throbbing pain. I am always walking around holding my breast or rubbing it and sometimes I dont realize i am doing it. Hubby reminded me in church today to let go of my breast! oops.",

At that time, I did not have this huge lump. I did however have the bleeding cysts. He did no exam, did not look at my ultrasound or mammo scans I took with me. He told me \" take ibuprophen, dont drink coffee, wear a sports bra and come back and see him when I had a lump\". Then he billed me 270$. grrrr. Needless to say, I left there in tears because he wouldnt listen to me. I did see another breast surgeon a month later who said all that I was going thru was fibrocystic related and he ordered another ultrasound to check for abnormal cysts. None were found but the begining of the large lump showed on the ultrasound. I questioned the ultrasound tech and he said it was just a dense spot. That was done in April. The \"dense\" spot is now the hard, large lump. Hope that makes sense because it sure doesnt to me! We then moved to Missouri and now I am lost again and inbetween doctors. I have not had a mammo since finding the hard lump. The doctor here that I seen was not concerned and said that it is a part of my breast.",

He said he knew the minute he cut me open, he could see it. He told me that the mass he took out had several bleeding cysts in it and was the type of mass that had a high potential to turn cancerous if left unattended. He said that the mass was indeed b9 (YAY!) and that by me being persistant in getting answers (10 doctors) and knowing my body, that helped. He wants me back every 6 months for testing as he said I was high risk. I am trying not to dwell on the fact that I have had soo many doctors that always said \"oh its just fibrocystic breast disease\" and get angry with them. I urge other women that if you know something is wrong , then keep pressing forward to find that doctor that will care and help...so, I celebrate my finding..but I will always have that 6 month checkup in the back of my head to worry about! Thanks all for your encouragement and I will be back daily to offer my support, love and hugs just like I have recieved here!",

It had dawned on me when I looked at the slip of paper in with the ultrasound , the doctor had wrote to the radiologist tech to look at the ten oclock area on my right breast. This was done in February. The doctor told me after reading the results that it was a cyst. My question is....dont cysts fluctuate or go away? My lump that I had mentioned to you all here is at the ten oclock position on that breast. It has not gone away IF it is the cyst she is talking about and as a matter of fact it has gotten larger..does this make any sense?",

I go this friday for my pre op tests and then he will do an open biopsy on Monday. He said he will go thru my old scar from my biopsy years ago which is two inches long but he said he will probly have to go an inch farther to remove the lump. From there, my lump goes to pathology for testing. He (doc) said that I should have never had to go so long taking pain pills and that something should have been done long ago.

Last week while doing my pre op tests, I sat by this very pretty young lady of 47. She recognized the folder I held from the cancer center and asked me if I had breast cancer. She did have breast cancer and shared her story with me. She had been to several doctors last year and like me, was told it was normal. In Dec of last year she had a mammogram, ultrasound, and biopsy that all came back ok. She then went to the same doctor that I am currently seeing because she felt something was not right and he ran more tests and she was diagnosed with stage 2 cancer in Feb of this year. She told me she was meeting with the anethisist group (as was I) to prepare for her breast reconstruction. I was so excited for her! It was like two ships passing in the night. I dont know her name but I wished her well and she did me too. I had my open biopsy yesterday. The doctor went from saying it was a lump to a mass and he cut me in a totally different spot (about 3\") than what he had planned. I am very sore in the armpit area as well as the incision area today, but for the most part it has been okay. I go back this Friday for my results!",
