Lainey, I just moved my hair appt up to next Tues to get a spunky cut and then read your rooster post!  I almost spit my drink all over my desk!  I hope you make friends with your hair before it comes out, the upside is that if we don't like our haircuts it's going to fall out anyway and then we start from scratch! I was disapointed in some of my chemo nurses, they all rotate around hanging the meds so you never know who you'll get.  I mentioned eating ice chips to nurse who hung my first chemo bag, she said it wasn't necessary, that TC doesn't have that bad of SE. Ha! I guess she never had chemo.  She also poo-pood the Biotene mouthwash.  My friend who is also a nurse was visiting at the time of this conversation and knew all of the research I've done, I thought she was going to pee her pants when I brought out my massive cup of chipped ice and a water bottle!  I never got into the Claritin, Hard as nails, the Senokot or the brush I've been using on my skin in the shower every morning as preventive measures!  I was the youngest person in the room, it was not lively in there, everyone was much older and sleeping, I counted my blessings, there is always someone worse than me. I thought if these people can do this it should be a piece of cake for me.  I might fit in better next time because I'll be bald! I took my artbox along and made Christmas ornaments so the time just flew. Good Luck to all of the 12/5 ladies today, the anticipation is actually worse than the tx!  I'm going to take my claritin now and drink a bottle of water! Cinda",

I did use tampons with my period, which was the day after chemo! Yuck!  Also, just keep washing those hands, that's the best defense against germs, and don't share any utensils or drinks. MSBusDriver, I was glad to hear your hair posts, I'm a little less scared about my impending baldness this week.....just a little. IKTracey, LOL on your posts, you sounded like me just a few days ago, A friend had to give me an attitude adjustment, which I seem to need on a regular basis now!  I'd like to add 6. Having to listen to other people's horror stories of how they knew someone who died an excrutiating, painful death from cancer. Then they start to cry and you have to comfort THEM. What's up with that? By the way, my insurance company won't pay for a wig, they said it's medically UNNECCESARY. Ha! I gave that poor rep an ear full!

Lauren, I hear you on the SE's, I didn't know the meaning of extreme fatigue until this round of chemo.  I'm day 11 and feeling much better, but I took off 2 days this week to sleep!  I've never been that way, never!  Working full time and going thru tx is more of a challenge then I expected.  I finally decided just to listen to my body, if I'm tired, I'm staying home, no one is going to give me a medal if I go to work and feel lousy all day.  I still feel guilty about it, but I keep telling myself this is just a short period in my life and I have to put myself first. How tired do you think rads will make us?  I have another issue, my skin under my eyes is very tender and discolored, I know this has to do with all of the crying I did when Sadie died, but don't you think it would have cleared up by now?  Any suggestions?  I've tried all types of eye cream.  I look like a zombie.  I'm going to try to get some work done now.  Hope everyone stays well.

On the scarf thing, I was in a decadron whirlwind and decided to try to make a scarf the night of chemo, so at midnight I cut a yard of fabric (cool fabric) diagnally and then sewed up the side seams, so I had a gigantic triangle, I actually cut the yard down to about 34-35inches square.  The scarf is easy to tie and it doesn't have a bunch of fabric in the back.  It looks pretty good, considering I can't really sew more than a straight line!  I made 3 different ones.  Then tried to sleep! I just want to say that I too am very grateful for this site and all of you wonderful ladies.  I also use this site as my support group, some days I just like to read, others I have something to say.  It's comforting to know there is someone out there who truly understands.  I hope you all have a very healthy and blessed new year.  God Bless and much Love Cinda",

Ladies, I don't have a port, but I used to help put them in and we never gave restrictions to our pts.  So I think you're on the right track. Karen, So sorry you have to join.  One thing to remember is the anti-nausea meds have greatly improved since your last round with Chemo.  They say the Chemo drugs are as strong as ever, but the anti-nausea meds are even stronger.  So you can kick some cancer butt without feeling to bad.  I live in York, PA which is just south of Harrisburg. LisaSayers, your daughter sounds like a real inspiration, to be that young and deal with something like alopecia.  I know it's not life threatening, but it's certainally a big deal in a young girl's life.  So no more moaning about my hair from now on!  Does she let some of her scalp show when she wears her scarves?  Just wondering, I've been trying different tying techniques, one of these days my DH will find me all tangled up in a mess of scarves! Have a great day girls, and do something today that makes you feel good! Cinda",

HATE IT! Bold, we all need to melt down and I truly believe that you don't get it unless you live.  I wish I could go back to all of those breast ca pts and do it over. Mombos, I had tremendous bone pain tx#1 from the nuelasta, it took me by surprise and it took me out for a few days.  I asked my onc. if I could use Ibuprofen just for a few days and it made a world of difference, I hardly noticed the pain!  Now if I could only figure a way to get out of the fatigue! Have a good night Divas! Cinda",

Carie, I hope your hubby arrives safely today. Lauren, I'm so glad you had a great day, I had one of those days yesterday, I had my mojo back and it felt sooooooo good to be myself again! It's so interesting to read all of your comments on the HRT.  I'm definitely going to try the Tamoxifen and see what my response is to the drug.  Everyone reacts differently to the med, I have friends who have tolerated well, didn't notice any change in thenselves and friends who needed to stop the med.  At this point, for me, the benefits out weigh the risks and I have to give it a shot. Have a great day everyone and stay warm. Cinda",

I also spoke to my onc. about 4tx vs 6tx vs 8tx.  He said it goes by your lymph node involvement.  I had also read that before, so I feel ok with just 4tx.  My 4th is sched for Feb 12! I made it work today and am feeling ok.  I'm looking at my SE a little differently these days and am not going to go to work if I'm fatigued.  I did much better last time when I didn't push myself, even though the fatigue was worse than tx1.  I'm looking at chemo as being my friend, and I'm just going to let it do it's job. This insurance business is a load of crap!  I'd like to storm their offices. Still getting my period like normal and getting night sweats!  What's up with that? Lisa, I'm so glad to hear about your sister, I hope she celebrated that night, because it certainly is something to cheer about! Have a good day ladies and stick to the positive!",

Simvog, so sorry about your MIL, I have a friend who is 75 and doing well with tx, I'll keep your family in my prayers. Zuffa, WOOHOO!!!! You go girl, I sooooo happy that your kicking your tumors butt! On the survivor topic.... I'm not sure, I always felt that I would be ok, I tend to think of survivors as someone who had a near death experience, like a plane crash or 911, I feel like the cancer was a threat that I had to take care of, so I'm not sure what I'm going to call myself, it's personal for each of us.  But I feel like I'm doing EVERYTHING that I can medically do to rid myself of any cancer cells and then making some lifestyle changes on my own. So at the end of rads I'm going to consider myself cancer free, not until then. I went to a flower show this weekend and had major spring fever, if there is anything like that in your area you should go. Makes you feel good!",

Have a great weekend ladies.....hopefully the sun is shining where you are!",

I feel like I have a 2nd chance at life and I do look at things differently....enjoying the small things, letting the trivial things fall away....my new mantra is to LIVE OUTLOUD, and that's what I'm doing. Simog, you are in my prayers, I'm so glad your surgery went well, now it's recovery time, hang in there and pamper yourself. You've had a long and exhausting road. Mandy, I'm so sorry for your loss. I lost my shepherd last year during chemo and then lost my sheltie 39 days later, it was a hellish time......I now have 2 German shepherd puppies, one of which we rescued from a shelter, he was abused and is now doing great. it's amazing what love can do for a dog.   I still miss my 2 girls, I think that getting the puppies is a tribute to how much my girls meant to me. Take care of yourselves and Live Life! Cinda",
