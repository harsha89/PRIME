I was first diagnosed with Stage IIIB in 2012, and then in March of 2016 with Stage IV with mets to bone, liver & lungs. Overwhelming news at first, but am doing well so far. Did rads to bone mets in 3 locations, which helped with pain. Then did 3 cycles of Xeloda, but stopped that due to bad side effects for me. The response was good, though, so I went on Letrozole. Will see onco on Monday for checkup, and may switch to Arimidex, as Letrozole seemed to be causing joint pain and swelling (not sure if it is that, or something else causing this pain.) My CA 15 3 came down quite a bit, and my second scans showed shrinkage all around, so YAY, me! Hoping to continue the Whack a Mole game and stay ahead of it for quite some time. Feel free to message me anytime!",
