    "Content": "murielwhite5 wrote: Hi everyone, Its one year since I finished chemo (4 rounds) but for the last couple of months I have been having problems with my feet. They often feel like they are on fire and they tingle. When they are really bad I shuffle along as they are so sensitive. I get many electric shocks as well. I saw a Podiatrist and asked him about neuropathy and he said the nerves in my feet were good and he didn't think it was neuropathy. I asked my doctor at my last appointment and he said it will go away!!! However, it hasn't and it has got worse. Looks like neuropathy to me, any other suggestions?
