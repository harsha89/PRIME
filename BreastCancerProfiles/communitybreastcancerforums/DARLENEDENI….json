I tried to avoid the ER but 911 type diarrhea finally landed me there.  I had to come off for two weeks and then started back at 1/3 dose, much better.  I did that for 3 cycles and have been on 1/2 dose since. I have some minor hand & foot issues at the 1/2 dose.  Even with the stop and start and reduced dose, scans showed my two liver lesions had shrunk more than half after only two months.  Scans again soon and I hope I can continue as I am. By the way, lemon pie is one of my favorite deserts, surely it must be good for cancer! May the force be with you!!!  Darlene",

We scanned 09/08 and there were 8 lesions all under 5mm.  An unusual headache or dizziness will get you a brain MRI order. I know most of the ladies on this board would jump on a scan if there was even a small chance of having a new site of mets in their bodies, wow,  I just don't understand why they are willing to ignore something that if let go could cause you loose your sight, use of limbs or have seizures.  If the lesion is too large when found, then you can only have a crainiotomy for treatment and cannot use focalized radiation treatment. In some instances there are no choices when it is too large. Of course this is a fearful thing to do, but aren't all of our scans and treatments?  Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers to metastasize to the brain and it is part of the stage IV package.  I wish those that are too scared to pursue monitoring of the brain would keep those thoughts to themselves. A few wrong comments could keep someone from doing the right thing. Ladies facing this aspect of this disease need only support and knowledge.  We have to stay strong and proactive in our treatments!!  Remember 30% of Her2+ will get brain mets, so there is a 70% chance the scan will be CLEAR!!  Even with all of the associated anxiety waiting on the scan, nothing spells relief like a clean scan!!  There is a clinical trial at Rush Universty by a leading neurosurgeon to gather data to try to make routine, regular brain scans standard of care for Her2+ patients.  Daisylego, you are brave, and smart to do this, now go get a clean scan and tell us all about it so we can have a reason to celebrate!!!

Here is a cut and paste from Brainmetsbc.org web site from FAQ section that puts the info in a clear summation: Breast cancer metastasizes (spreads) to the brain in about 15-20% of women with metastatic disease. However, some factors put patients at higher risk. Women who are under fifty years of age, who have HER2-positive tumors, estrogen receptor-negative tumors, and lung or liver metastases are somewhat more likely to be diagnosed with brain metastases. Studies indicate that mutations in the BRCA1 gene are also a risk factor. Women who have HER2 metastatic disease have a risk of brain metastases ranging from 25-40%.   ",

Data supports rechecking the tumor type when dealing with the liver.  I would want to have discussion with a NCI onc about that possibility.  If she is now Her2 pos or TN, there are specific treatments you would want to use. As you know, everyone responds differently to tx.  Typically, when Xeloda fails, Gemzar is next up.  I had severe side effects on Xeloda and it didn't work well.   I reluctantly moved to Gemzar and I had severe side effects as well and it did not work.   Since Gemzar causes platelet drop and is in the same class of 5FU drugs, perhaps Navelbine might be a consideration (looks like she has many left).  I started it the end of March at a 50% dose and in one cycle my liver enzymes and tumor markers dropped significantly and my liver pain was greatly decreased.  I had to reduce to a 30% dose due to low WBC and RBC.  It is still giving me strong results with minimal side effects even at this modest dose.  I am getting with Herceptin.  I know it can be given with Avastin.  I am not educated about that, but perhaps something to consider for your wife. I will hope for quick results from her tx plan.  Keep us informed and give her a hug from a fellow liver metsister who has been there and is still here!!! Stay strong...Darlene",

I wanted to avoid additional reconstructive decisions and potential cosmetic surgeries.  If I have recurrence, then I can have a mastectomy.  The goal for stage IV is not curative, it is to reduce tumor burden and to obtain loco-regional control. I had a conversation with a gal at my onc last year who was stage IV and she said \"you don't do surgery on a stage IV patient, it won't help me now and I don't want the risks or the agony of surgery.\"  I tried to talk with her about the importance of loco-regional control and apparently her breast surgeon did not fully explain what that entailed, so, she had no use for my thoughts. Anyway, the tumor continued to grow, so, she would only do radiation, no surgery.  Well, she endured tremendous pain, infection and many issues with that procedure only to find that she had no choice but to do surgery because the radiation did not work and caused additional problems.  Her surgery was more extensive than it would have been in the beginning because of the radiation damage. I have know several other women who did not have surgery and when their disease progressed, so did the tumor and it broke through the skin and it was horribly painful and smelly and caused additional unnecessary agony during their last months of life. I say, if the window of opportunity opens to do surgery while you are doing relatively well, take advantage and get loco-regional control.  It may or may not add to your survival, but it just might and will help with loco-regional control and to perhaps keep it from invading the chest wall which is very difficult to treat. It's been a year since my successful lumpectomy and I just had my mammogram and the girls are behaving right now.  I hope this gives you and anyone thinking about this issue some thought provoking information.  I might add that you should talk with a BREAST surgeon about this, not a GENERAL surgeon who also does breasts along with other surgeries.  The oncologist's role here is to think about disease management, the breast surgeon will focus on loco-regional control, two different animals that can help support one another. Ask your breast surgeon to show you some pictures of tumors that have progressed out of the breast. Good luck...Darlene",

I am a bigger fan of Cyroablation for the liver which is done by an interventional radiologist.  It is easy for them to see on CT the lesion and the formation of the ice ball to be sure they are getting only the lesions with minimal margins and there is emerging data suggesting that this particular method causes an immune reaction by the body not seen with RFA (heat or radio waves) or any radiation. Since your liver is vital and we especially tax it with chemo and will need to continue to have future chemos, I would leave any radiation to the liver as a last choice. If you go the Cyber route, I would only have it done at Stanford.  Just my humble opinions, here. Let us know how things go and good luck....Darlene",

When I was first dx my liver had too many lesions to count and I had an accute liver episode right after starting treatment.  It was a very unpredictable time and the oncologist wasn't sure how things would go for me.  I responded very well to Taxol, Carbo Herceptin and the liver cleared up in 4 months.  Those three stubborn lesions came back after 8 months of Herceptin only.  In your circumstances, it might be best to go with systemic treatment with chemo and maybe use focalized treatments to clean up any stubborn mets that are left (if any!). I hope you are able to move to a treatment that works well and fast for you!!!! Darlene",

I spent time with a friend yesterday that came into my life when I had similar thoughts as you.  I was stage IV at dx with extensive liver mets, and did not want face ongoing chemo.  My friend was diagnosed at age 37 with extensive liver mets and did endure 9 months of chemo.  She had told her onc and family that she would endure no more treatments and went off the chemo at 9 months and our onc had to beg her to accept Herceptin (she was a lottery recipient of the drug in 1998).  When she stopped treatment he had been working behind the scenes to get her approved to receive the drug and it took him 3 months.  He told her you can chose to take it and you can chose to stop it if it impedes your QOL.  She agreed to try Herceptin and has only been on Herceptin with no real QOL issues, other than going in for infusions every three weeks since 1998 and is still NED, has worked, watched her 3 children graduate, go on to college and became a grandmother 10 months ago.  I am on Xeloda which is an oral chemo I take at home with a good QOL and have been on it since Jan.  This was not my oncologists first choice for me and he wanted to give me a more agressive cytotoxic chemo.  I know others who have been on Xeloda for several years and are stable.  Had they not tried Xeloda they would have subcumbed to the disease.  Months with a good QOL is a HUGE gift to you and your family.  I don't know you or what information you based your decision on, I can only hope you have been given all of the CORRECT medical information about YOUR type of breast cancer. You can even chose to skip standard of care regimens and perhaps try something aimed at QOL and see if it gives you comfortable time.  Even if you forgo chemo or target therapies,  there are palliative treatments that will improve your QOL during your remaining time.  Please don't close your mind to these options.  Your thoughts, feelings and need for support are always welcomed here.  There are many women here for you.  I sense you do not want the pity and attention this disease brings.  You don't have to tell anyone but who you chose to tell.  I did not want the pity part and I can say what I perceived as pity has shown to be true care and compassion and friendships at a depth I have never known and would have never known otherwise.  Another gift in this mess. I wish you peace and comfort physically and spiritually as you move forward. With loving respect, Darlene",

Although you are NED and have had a nice long dance with it, your disease is UNPREDICTABLE and sadly for all of us, it can change in one scan.  Your onc will be attesting to \"statistics\", not  just your individual prediction, which he really does not know, no one does.  Your insurance company knows this too.  It is not likely they will request anything more than the claim form once they see that you have Metastatic Breast Cancer.  Even if they do, and find a way to not pay the claim, what have you lost?  You are not a cheater or making a fraudulent claim.  You are taking the steps set forth by the policy contract to see if you are eligible for a policy benefit that you have paid for. I think  your onc should and will simply sign off on the form.  They do these types of things every day.  You need to take these steps while you have a valid contract and are well enough to make these decisions.  I encourage you to obtain advice from a trusted adviser after obtaining the funds about using them to pay off your father's mortgage.  There may be reasons to not use the funds in that manner.  Might be better to use it to make payments and keep the bulk of the money available to help you in the future, should you need it for disability, medical reasons, etc.  Once it's gone, it's gone.   Just want you to consider YOUR best interests now and later.

NED doesn't mean you don't have cancer, that would be a cure.  NED means there is no CURRENT evidence of the disease detectable by current scans and testing, you still have cancer and it will be come evident again. Stage IV, even NED, will be a no go, I'm sorry to say.  Because of my life insurance background, I have had many pm's aimed at trying to \"find ways around\" this and I just want to stress, that the application becomes part of the policy contract and any misrepresentations or ommissions will cause the company to exercise the contestibility clause and not pay your beneficiaries the policy face amount, only a return of the premiums that you paid. And in this economy, you better believe they will investigate heavily any short term death. If you have a large sum of money, there are some companies that will accept it and set a live to date and if you live past it your family will get the stated death benefit.  For example if you have $25K and the insurance company accepts it and you live say, 10 years, a death benefit of $50k would be paid.  This is not a market I worked in and don't know much more about it that this.  But maybe a life representative with a large life insurance only company would be able to help you.

Within 15 minutes of infusion, I was laid out like a baby. We were able to clear out the CSF of the cancer, but I ended up with menegitis that almost killed me. I'm told that if it should return, we'd use Depocyt instead of Methotrexate. It's easier on the body and you need it less often. After we finished chemo, I had WBR and full spinal radiation. Knocked the you know what out of me. Damaged my spinal nerves and I've lost feeling from my braline down to my toes. But, the neurologist thinks with PT, something will come back. We check my CSF regularly and, so far, so good. We are working now on between the neck and the hips. Hope this helps.

An IV treatment every three weeks is a small price to pay.  This is a sneaky, evil disease that lurks in our bodies, never let your guard down.  My onc has many patients out over 5 years because of the continuance of Herceptin and gives it for life.  Good luck...Darlene",

It took a long time for the first eight lesions to totally dissolve and not be visible on scans.  Even after 13 months the last 3 treated are still the same size, but since no increase in 13 months they are considered necrotic and may or may not dissolve completely.  It may take a while before you see reduction in size.  WBR delivers grays of radiation in lower amounts over a period of time and it is not uncommon for it to take some time. I hope you are able to arrange the addition of the Tykerb without too much resistance, if you decide to use it. Darlene",

Treatment of brain mets outside of standard of care WBR requires seeking out equipment, open minded physicians and the right facility.  Typically, you will do better at a university NCI facility that has a tumor board.  It is very important to know that the number of lesions is not the key to being a candidate for SRS.  Tumor volume, where they are located and your level of education play the largest role in determining if SRS could be utilized in your INDIVIDUAL case.  Don't go by my treatment or anyone else's.  All of the factors about your case have to be considered.  DO reach out for all available options and considerations BEFORE accepting WBR or any proposed treatments.

I wish you luck with that devil drug, Decadron.  I refuse to take it, it's awful.  Hope you are done with it soon.  Best to you on your future surveillance brain scans.!! Darlene",
