I will tell you though and I am not trying to scare you but I had to have two reconstructions.  My first plastic surgeon was definitely not a perfectionist and the two sides ended up very different.  I had to have a revision done (by a different surgeon) and different implants put in.  Now they look much better and are symmetrical as well as perky.  The down side is that I really don't have much sensation. If you have enough tissue I think you can do a double reconstruction but I doubt if you will be able to get \"D\"s.  If you look at using your own tissue make sure you find a surgeon that can do DIEPs instead of TRAM flaps.  DIEPs dont use your muscle so you have less chance of other complications later.  Some surgeons have been trained in DIEPs and SGAPs which both use your own tissue.  I feel that If the surgeon is only able to do TRAM flaps I would get another opinion because that would indicate to me that they haven't been keeping up on the latest procedures. One way one of the ladies here said that she found her surgeon was to go to a breast cancer support group and ask the ladies there who they were happy with.",

In addition, in my case the Oncotype DX test was not covered by my insurance.  It is a $3000 plus test - at least it was 2 years ago.  I did get some of the cost \"forgiven\" but it was still quite costly.  If you are not in the gray area that the Oncotype is developed for,  you may be spending a lot of money for no additional information. In my case I was so freaked out about having cancer that I wanted all my tests and surgeries done yesterday or the day before.  But in your case if you are thinking of declining additional treatment anyway, you have plenty of time to get more information.  If you change your mind within a short time after surgery, there most likely will not be a significant effect on the outcome of the treatment plan. If you don't respect the opinion of the oncologist that you have already seen, you probably should not continue with that person.  You will most likely see your oncologist for YEARS of follow up after this diagnosis so you may want to find one that you trust.

I had a bilat. 12/30/06 at age 43.  My Oncotype score was 13.  I did not have to have chemo or radiation but I was ER+ (90%) so I chose to have Tamox.  I had no side effects on Tamox. except for significant growth of uterine fibroids - caught on routine sonogram- not because of side effects that I noticed.  Since Tamox. gives a higher risk of uterine cancer (not cervical), and I was so estrogen sensitive, I chose to have a hysterect/oopherectomy at age 45. Tamox. is not a hormone.  It is a SERM - selective estrogen receptor modulator.  It binds to your free-estrogen so that it is not available to effect other organs.  It is also offers mild protection from bone loss - which is good for those of us over 40.  Tamox. has been around a very very very long time and has a good track record.  Since I am not HER2+, I have not done any research on Herceptin.  But there are many who believe that are still here because of it. There are no guarantees for any treatment but please don't discount your options until you have all the information available presented to you.",

Cancer can also be treated like a chronic illness.  You can start by treating it aggressively when first diagnosed or you can wait and see.  If you wait and see, you may not have any recurrence and no further treatment may be necessary.  But if you wait and see, and your symptoms change including a recurrence or mets then your options for treatment will change accordingly - your options will not necessarily be the same ones you have now because your disease will be different.  In my view and my case, Tamoxifen is part of a long term treatment of a chronic illness.  Once I am finished with Tamoxifen (and maybe before), there will be nothing inhibiting my estrogen receptors and I may have a recurrence.  BUT it is my hope that by taking the Tamox. I will have at least 5 extra years of NED and hopefully those little estrogen fed cancer cells will starve and never come back!  At the very least my children will be 5 years older and more ready to face the world.  If I have a recurrence when this treatment is over, I will face new choices.  I am lucky in that I can tolerate my current treatment without difficulty.  I know that is not the case for all and other choices need to be made. Good luck with your decisions",

But I truly understand why some of the questions would annoy especially if as jeanne says that you have your own questions of the day.  So I still think having a \"Is this mets\" forum would allow those who are worried post those questions.  And then those who want to answer can say:  \"I'm sorry you are worried, I am sorry you have those symptoms.... if I were you I would go see your Oncologist/Lymphedema Specialist/Breast Surgeon/Radiologist/PCP etc etc etc. \" Because really what else can one say?  We can't order the scans or tests for anyone. There will always be those who post here by error.  But I think once people are redirected a few times it will become clear to those who read these boards where the appropriate forum is.  Then I would hope that the frequency would decrease. Although I hope I haven't posted anything overtly stupid on this forum, I do read the posts here and on the hospice/palliative care forums.  I value the stories and comments that I read and I have gotten a lot of useful information.  I recently lost one of my dearest friends to bc.  She was in complete denial that she had mets and she had convinced herself and her pcp that she had lymes disease. (long story) She waited a very long time to have a complete work up and I believe that it may have contributed to her rapid decline.  I think that if she would have asked her questions to those who post here someone would have said..\"Go see your oncologist!!!!!!\" and maybe she would have benefitted from earlier treatment.  As it was she did not want to \"scare\" me since I am more recently diagnosed.  When she finally told me her symptoms I said \"Go see your oncologist!!!!!\"  Needless to say, she did not have Lymes. If people think that a different forum for these questions would be helpful how would that come about?",

I always book my appointment for the first thing in the morning.  He starts at 7:30AM and I always book that appointment.  His wife now works in the office because she sees him on their commute to work together and on their way home. There are physicians who overbook because of financial incentives and I agree that those people should really re-think their office management.  But if you are feeling charitable, try to see if it is because of poor management or truly caring about each person.",

The first week was a little difficult because of the drains and taking a shower.  I actually went to a hair salon the third day home so they could wash and blow dry my hair because I wanted to feel \"normal\".  You also will have lifting restrictions and it is amazing how heavy that neighborly pan of lasagna is!  I made several meals ahead of time.  If I had to do it over I would have put them in foil pans not my heavy glass baking dishes.  I was driving fairly quickly (7 days?) but it is a strange feeling when you have to crank the steering wheel.  I also have a van and kept forgetting that it was the closing of the back door that was the hard part - reaching overhead and pulling down...I forgot initially and had to ask a stranger in the grocery store parking lot to do it for me.  It is also amazing how heavy the double doors to the doctor's office are! My children were pre-teens at the time so they were very helpful but don't turn down any offers from neighbors or friends.  Children tend to lose focus on the \"helpful\" part fairly quickly and want to know when you are going to be cleared to vacuum again! Best of luck to you...",

Are the drains supported?  I had these little bags that attached to my mastectomy bra that the drains went in.  It kept them from hanging and annoying the skin area even more. It didn't actually hurt when the drains were pulled out but it is a really strange feeling.  You may want to take something before you go in that day if you are worried. Take good care",
