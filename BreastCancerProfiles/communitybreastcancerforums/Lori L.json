I had a score of 18 and was told it was a personal choice by my oncologist and he didn't push, plus 2 other oncologist said they wouldn't recommend for me. However, my radiologist did recommend it. It was a very tough choice but I already had my radiation and they usually like to do chemo first, then radiation, then hormone therapy. I had my lumpectomy 12-3 and due to insurance initially denying my treatment (I won my appeal) it delayed my treatment initially as I was treated as self-pay. So this late in the game to do chemo now, they don't know if it would benefit me. I'm 4 months out from surgery. Best of luck to you!!!",
