I was diagnosed with breast cancer 2004, my doc had me get an ultra sound and because he never told me anything I assumed all was ok. This past December I started with a new primary doctor and he saw that I had a large growth on my right kidney. It was found in 2004 but no one told me. Thank goodness it didn't get worse but I learned from this you cannot depend on your doctors to take such good care of you,you cannot assume anything. If you have a test done make sure you have your doctor show you the results. For some reason I can't get in the chat room, but if anyone wants to contact me my email is shulamis@comcast.net Log in to post a reply",
