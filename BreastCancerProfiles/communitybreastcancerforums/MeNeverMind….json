I was just reading throught the last 20 pages since I was here last so let me say... Sex? I totaly don't feel like it. I am bald and backed up and want to puck. Very sexy. Hubby is just going to have to deal with himself. Sounds? Everything gets on my nerves. The tv is always to loude, even hubbys voice can become to much. And if the cat meows again I may just let her outside. Periods? Had 1 right after my 1st treatment, not another. Love that. Dry skin? My face is falling off it is so dry. I scrub and scrub and then put mu foundation on and I an still flacking off. The corners of my mouth craked 3 weeks ago and bleed almost every day. I eat lotion and lip balm but still craked and dry. Now my feet have started to dry and crack. Lucky me. I have always had trouble with dry skin in the winter. If I can have the humidifyer on so high that the windows drip I might make it through the season. But this is so much worse. Wigs? i am so sick of fake hair. I want my real long soft hair back! I never had bangs so it is real hard getting used to having stuff in my face all the time. Christmas? I put up one nontraditional tree and I kicked my butt. i don't even feel like going shopping. I am doing shawls that I found on line for all the ladys since I am always cold I figured it was a good idea. One stop shopping. But I have nothing for the men and I am not sure I care at this point. Food? Is it me or does everything taste like crapy wall paper paste? EVERYTHING is WAY to SPICY!!! Even minuet rice with out salt seems spicy to me. If I wasn't always so hungary I would never eat. Bread is to sharp, soup (even salt free) is to salty. Water tastes like crap (yes, even with a touch of lemon in it) Even chocolate milk to yuckie. Chocolate was my fall back and now that tastes like crap to. Husbands? Don't get me wrong I love mine. He is so sweet. Does all the dishes before coming to bed. The laundry is getting washed and dry, not put aways but who really cares. I know he if feeling left out. I get home from work by 5pm and try to be in bed by 7pm. With making dinner that doesn't leave anytime for anything else. And it seems that the last 2 weekends were mostly me laying in bed and him playing a video game. Not what he wants but he is dealling with it. Tongue? Mine still is raw. Bleeding this morning when I brushed it. My whole mouth is raw. Everything tastes like crap, but I think I said that already. Poopy fairies? Never stoped getting those visits. Thank God for the small stuff. Sleep? Never really had any trouble. Thank God for the small stuff. I feel so much better. Thank you all for letting me vent. In reading I saw that I am not the only whimp in the group. I hope everyone is doing ok. ((((((((((((((((HUGS)))))))))))) to all those who are not doing good.

He is a guy.  And he is scared.  I know one of the first things he said was that this was so hard for him because he is always able to fix stuff.  But not this.  I have started to ask him for help more which I think is helping alittle.  So when I came home on Friday from work I took my wig off and it felt weird.  i spent this whole weekend not reallying feeling like myself.  When I took my wig out this morning I had this great feeling of having found myself.  I think that I will be cutting my hair on this weekend.  Quick question... Is the second set of drugs harder on the system then the first?  I know it all builds up but I really don't know anything about what is to come after the 16th od December for me.  Thanks all.  I think I should go to work now.  Have a great safe and happy and healthy days.

I will have to go this weekend to get the not as good wig styled and this one needs a bang trim.  It was cool at the doctors yesterday a bunch of new people said they loved my hair.  Little did they know its a wig.  I can never hear that enough.  Is it wrong to have ice cream for breakfast?  I stopped to pick up some yummy chocolate milk and the ice cream looked good.  It has 4% vitamin A and 6% calcium per serving.  So it's not all bad for me.  My chemo, my food choices.  Becca S:  So sorry you are having trouble.  (((((((((((((((((((((((HUGS))))))))))))))))))))) Pam: Things I miss most on chemo= Eating spicy foods, like ketchup .  Yes ketchup is to spicey or tangy for me to eat.  I have always had low spice tolerance but this is ridiculous. Things I miss least on chemo = House work. Most annoying side effect= The smell from my brown/red anti nausea pill I can't think of the name of.  Or should it be memory loss?  I forget. LOL  Silver lining= Both my relationship with my husband and families are greatly improved.  We talk, I mean really talk.  And my faith is growing stronger by the day.  I mean there must be a reason that I am going through all this.   ((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((BIG HUGS)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))) to all the brave warriors.  Good luck that today will be a great day for all.  Love Kimmy",
