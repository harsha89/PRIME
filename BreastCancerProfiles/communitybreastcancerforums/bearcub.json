It totally blindsided me, no real BC history, a aunt had it 30 years previous but lived another 30 yrs and did not die from it...I sure hope you get a biopsy result that is negative for BC. Benny I also had waist long hair, it was sad to have to cut it short but I was glad I did about a month before I lost it from chemo. It was a bit less traumatic, I now have hair envy though, whenever I see pretty long hair. The one thing I learned was short hair is so easy to care for. Oh well I only have 2 more rounds of Chemo so I can start growing it back in November, and maybe by summer it will feel like chemo is behind me and I will have a cute short do. To those who have had surgery The one thing that you need to watch for is LE, Lymphedema, swelling of the arm that nodes were taking out of. Do all the exercises your surgeon mentioned and ask your surgeon about it. Never let a nurse or anyone take your BP, IV, or any needles in the arm that had the nodes removed. Just thought I would mention it as it was brought to my attention on another thread. Edith will you be doing chemo?... Have a fun weekend everyone!",

It did slowly ease up over several weeks. When I did see the surgeon she thought it was fluid drying up??...also pain in the ribs that went away. I thought maybe it had something to do with a doctor or nurse elbowing or leaning into me during surgery??...your pain will go away please try and not worry. Do talk to your doctors about it on the 10 or try and move the appt. up like NSJ2 suggested. If it is an infection they may want to get you on antibiotics. I am praying for a great path report for you. I feel terrible for the barn owner whose wife passed so quickly. She must have caught it so late she had extensive spread to her abdomen or she died from some uncontrolled infection. So sad......hang in there Benny, enjoy Diamond today.",

Benny, you can try Paula young.com for a wig that will get you through a few months if you prefer a wigs. You can also check out head covers.com also for scarves and wigs but be prepared with them to pay extra for duty at the border. About 20 dollars an order, so if you order from them get everything you may want in 1 order....all in all they both are very reasonably priced. Lesley is right, I am usually tired the first week after chemo but still manage most days to ride 16 km. a day on my stationary bike....I try to do it 5 days a week. I also walk my dog outside. You may be one of those people that have minimum SE. I have been very lucky that way. I am sure on your good days you will still be out on Diamond...",

I also bought a beanie type of pad that goes under the scarves, it helps so scarves don't slip plus they add warmth. Do not fear the chemo, it is doable, most don't get all the SE. On your good days spend with Diamond riding. Remember it is being done to give you many more years with Diamond. When you go get chemo take a picture of her with you. Try and go to the look Good Feel Better class, they teach about scarves, wigs and you get a beautiful makeup kit.

I was watching the news and wanted to say to all our down under girls, that heat and fires you are experiencing in Australia sounds pretty brutal. Stay cool and safe!....I have a few feet of snow in my yard I wish I could send down, lol.. Bevlee congrats on the baby news, grand babies are so special. I have 8 ranging in age from 4 year old twins girls to our 16 year old grandson.....that's pretty good considering I am 29 years old, still.... Carlads I bet the hair looks cute, hope you get minimal SE from your chemo. Websister I hope your feeling better, so nice that you can spend time with your mom, I sure miss mine. Dakota your kids sound like they keep you hopping, they are so special. Edi I would love to see your sassy wig, I wish I could figure out how to put pics up. If you every get it let me know. Hope the itch is gone! Liefie welcome back I had my 2/16 rads today, it isn't bad at all so far and the ladies have been very nice. I am hoping my skin holds up but being fair makes me nervous. As a kid I would burn, fair skin and red hair. The RO told me that skin color doesn't really make a difference that even dark skinned people can have bad reactions and fair skinned be fine. We will just have to see. All the other sisters, have a super Weekend",

I know you didn't want a feeding tube but if it keeps you getting nourishment and calories to keep you strong it wouldn't be so bad. My oldest grandson has Crohns disease and 2 years ago had a abscess in his colon, he could only have boost for 4 months while he was in hospital in Vancouver children's hospital, if he couldn't tolerate it they would have given him a feeding tube. He has friends that did have the tubes. It is usually temporary. It is so important to get your strength up. Please try to stay strong for Benny and Di.",

I got three little ones like a freckle, you can hardly see them, it really is not a big thing to worry about but it sure makes lining you up easy and quick. As a warrior I think of them as my war wounds...but like you I was a little afraid, all for nothing!! DH and myself have started a puzzle on the dining table and have spent 2 days now putting together a beautiful South Pacific beach, a nice thing when it's too cold for a walk. Nahahi I have never skied into a moose, scary....but I hit one 16 years ago in a car accident. I was lucky to walk away from that with nothing more than a mouthful of glass and a terrible case of the shakes. The way the windshield popped down I was about 1/2 inch from a lobotomy....funny thing before I hit it I could feel something push me way back in the seat....maybe a guardian angel? Since then my DH has hit 3....and we are good drivers!! Traii hope the arm is good, and Carlads hope you are still fairly SE free. Hey Bev hope you are doing good! Take Care everyone!",

I have herceptin infusions every 3 weeks, that started after my chemo since I only required AC, but if you get the Taxols, I am pretty sure herceptin can be given at the same time. Others here will walk you through that. Yes, it looks like you are Er and pr negative. Don't read anything before 2010 on the net, it just is not new enough. All of us have been exactly where you are and you can do this! My DH bought that book Breast Cancer Husband by Marc Silver back when I was diagnosed it is a awesome book and I highly recommend it. Edi sorry about the veins, yes good advice from Websister. Hope you feel better soon. As for the cake never mind the pic, I want a slice!! Traii I hope your DS was able to get the pony ride. Carlads hope you are feeling fine. Benny you sound like you are in a great place, hope you keep feeling well....loved the pic in the cowboy gear at chemo, lol I think that mashed potato diet may be something I need to go on!

As a kid we stayed at Bonny Hills in NSW, north of Sydney for 3 months. I remember a wave grabbing me right off my feet and twirling me under the water. At the time it was pretty scary.

I read back a bit and Edi I was brought to tears reading about your meltdown in the kitchen. I think we have all done it. I think we are all suffering PTSD, post traumatic stress disorder. I think thats why I needed the cancer break. Your Grandaughter is a little beauty, you are so lucky to be living so close to her. Your bathroom looks awesome!! Nihahi I wanted to tell you a while back you posted pictures of snowy owls, they were beautiful, those beautiful pictures have a calming effect. When my DH and myself got married 36 years ago he told me if a eagle flys over your car it means good luck, I don't know if it is true but it makes me feel better. I may have missed something, last I heard you were fighting with the alien boob, I hope you are feeling better, and good grief, I hope you can get a better sleep than 30 min.... Traii, I was thinking of you yesterday when I read in our newspaper that some guy who is a talented marathoner from Prince George, B.C., died in a Melbourne hospital after a tree branch fell on him during a storm. He was only 58 and fit as a fiddle, go figure! I bet Easter with your little guy was a blast. Websister I hope your mom is doing better, and they didn't rush her back to the lodge. Is the snow in Calgary starting to go, this was a horrible winter for us, we got tons of snow in February and March, It felt like everytime i had a appointment in town it would be a whiteout.....I told my DH I wasn't going to retire here in 3 years. I think we have agreed that somewhere on Van Island would be just right. I was meaning to ask about the herceptin, I am having number 7 on April 10th, I just worry so much that my heart won't make it to the 17th one. My last muga scan had my number at 58. I started at 63. What number of herceptin are you on and what is your left valve ejection number. I will keep my fingers crossed that I can make it through all 17. I also had a young guy for rads, I actually have given up who is looking at my chest, it feels like everyone has!! Liefie I am envying you on the island, I hope you are feeling well. I have been watching the Jodi Arias trial for the last 2 months, it takes my mind off cancer, and I booked Disneyland for myself and my daughter and her 2 kids. We will be leaving Mother's Day for a week! We are super excited. This trip was cancelled last year as I was Dx a few weeks before the trip. We were going to RV down the coastline but this year we are just going to fly. To all the girls on this site Happy Easter, may you all have a beautiful spring, we sure deserve it and some peace of mind. XOXO",

It felt real weird and I couldn't make eye contact with anyone for a day then I got used to it and it it was okay. I have 2 wigs, and don't wear either mostly hats and scarves I made from a McCalls pattern....I also thought of hooking the bread into my hat or scarf but I haven't done it yet...you can look up how to tye a scarf with a braid and its using long tails of the scarf to make a long braid....I am going to try it.

You are on your way and we are here, and before you know it you will be finished too. Did you buy a wig yet, or cut the hair a bit shorter. You are going to look great!....we're you ever able to go to a look good feel better class? Are there drivers for people doing chemo in your area? Talk to your cancer coordinator she may be able to help you with that....ps...I could have easily driven home from chemo but they wouldn't let me. Edith I have had the same problem with my posts....write them and then poof don't post. It sure is frustrating.

Yes, you definitely need to see a nutritionist. I hope tomorrow is a better day. When is your next chemo? Traii that is a great picture of you. I hope you will be SE free.....

I agree with Benny's advice so I won't repeat it. Your post reminds me why we fight so hard through these treatment plans. The options are limited, treatment or no treatment. I for one am so happy we have treatment and I would always choose that. Take Care. I had # 7/16 rads this morning. I am still doing fine, a bit pink. I am doing 2-3 saline compresses a day and they gave me this cream that I put on once a day not greasy and it works like a glove....the only wording on the tube is Stratpharma...it is wonderful. I will say this is such a breeze compared to chemo. The bonus about driving into radiation everyday is seeing the snowy owls...we have had some migrate into the area and have stuck around, and I have seen at least 20....I had never seen one in the wild before. They are beautiful. Everyone have a fantastic weekend....",

I hope Your DH has some sensor lights near his garden... We spent a week in Parksville on the water after my surgery and before chemo. It was beautiful, then drove up to Comox Kye Bay for a few days, ferry to Powell River and Gibsons, Whistler and home. It certainly gave me a new energy to get home and do chemo.",

Dakota you remind me so much of my oldest daughter, she is 35 and going through the same as you, her DH is an ass. She is doing mediation for the legal separation they have lived apart since Dec. 2011...and she is still trying to get things worked out. I could not imagine her having to deal with BC and that. She did go for her first mammogram about 10 days ago and got a call back, had a Ultrasound, and is waiting the results. I am praying she gets a good result. The RO was leaning towards cyst. I will say you sound great and I think your frame of mind has you in a good place. You can do this. I will say my next door neighbour called me about 10 days ago she also went for her first mammogram, (shes 48)..got the callback and now has been given a appointment with the surgeon and has to have a biopsy. I am praying she gets a B9 result. Liefie you are so right, we are alive, I will live with my loose neck and tummy pouch. Yes, Jodi Arias is a psychopath, scary...I sure hope the victims family gets justice. Take Care All",

My surgeon said the same thing almost positive it was cancer...on the mammogram it was picture perfect. I was where you are last June. Now I am done surgery and have my last chemo on Wednesday. Keep up with the foods, you want to try and maintain your weight. You are in the hardest part right now, the testing....waiting for results. We are here for you 24/7. It may sound crazy but it does get easier. Traii and Edithester it is so nice to chat with ladies from all over the world. I have a aunt and uncle and cousins living north of Sydney at Bonny Hills on the coast near Port MaQuarrie, NSW. I also have a grandfather from Oswestry, Shropshire in the UK. Good luck with the fuzzy tongues, lol feels weird doesn't it. Mine only last for a few days. I have been on the AC. Hope you all have a good week, I am feeling good, go for bloodwork tomorrow and last chemo on Wednesday!!!!",

Try and take a treat out to Diamond and just give her some loving, she will certainly give it back.

Remember to take some one with you tomorrow and tell them their job is to take notes....because it is hard to remember anything in a doctors office. Write any questions down you may have. If they allow you to record the session even better but ask first. Also ask the doctor for copies of any tests you have had done to date and continue to get copies throughout your treatment. Keep them in your file. Take a deep breath, you can do this you are a warrior!! Take care, Carrie",

I think that is a normal response, At least I hope so as I did the exact same thing. I was eating right, biking 22 km. 6 days a week, and I still got BC, no family history except an aunt and apparently that is not considered. I also was in shock, but as you move through your doctors apps and educate yourself on BC you will begin to relax. Just curious if it was your GP who told you the lymph nodes were all going to be removed? This would not be his area of expertise. I would not rely on my GP, only your surgeon or oncologist's opinions. So sorry about the loss of your horses, I do think stress doesn't help, but you most likely already had your cancer? When I was dx we were 2 weeks away from a planned vacation down the Oregon coast to Disneyland, Vegas and home. That got cancelled. My hair was to my waist until about 8 days ago I braided it and chopped it off, then went to town to touch it up. I will probably lose what I have mid Sept....it is sad but at least we are moving forward and live in a time that we can treat our cancer. So I hope you have some friends to hold your hand, and help you through this. The ladies on this forum will guide you, they have been so helpful for me. We will give you strength.",

I think of it as a insurance policy. I also will be doing radiation and then herceptin for a year and then 5 years on Tamoxifen. You must be Her2+. Do you know when your first chemo is? I am happy you have someone to go with you. I would cut my hair to a bob or shorter before treatment mind you it is a personal preference. I have never seen the Beenies at Walmart. The one under the scarves I use is a padded quilted circle thingy that sits on my head and comes down to my ears. I have bought a wig from Paula Young very reasonable...I never wear it though...good luck on your journey, it will get easier each day as the shock wears off...just keep moving forward.",

You will find the crying jags will come further and further apart and be quite surprised when all of a sudden you have time and feel up to seeing Diamond....and you will smile and feel almost normal. I always said I would never feel comfortable going to town in a scarf looking like a cancer patient and now I don't care. Truthfully no one really even takes notice. I hope I remind at least 1 person to go get the mammogram they may have forgotten to do. Give Diamond and your kitty lots of hugs, don't go giving all of your stuff away you will be around a for a long time yet. Animals are very healing... There is another trial out of Edmonton I think on a drug called Metforin or something like that. It seems promising and I may ask my Onco about it...",

Get some deserved sleep, I hope you have minimal SE and can get out and see Diamond soon. After yesterday's chemo, I was out driving our 3500 dodge diesel truck alone today...no problem. I love your wig, it's beautiful. p Traii, your DH sounds like he has a fun sense of humour!! That does help, Edith after the hair starts to go it may be best to just shave it off, it really is a relief when it is gone as it seems to come with so much anticipation, it's the worst part, but once it's done as a warrior you can do anything!!..and it really isn't as bad as we all thought it would be, it is a blip in our time, it will grow again. I am having indigestion today the doc gave me a prescription for Ranitidine, it works great and fast...I just took one. Lifie and Dakota glad to see your doing well and getting some exercise in, it really helps you feel in control. It helps pump oxygen to our brains and OMG we need it, lol. Dakota to bad about the D***H....I sure hope you have some loving people around you. Edith I am going to buy your book!! Have a super Friday Warrior girls!! ((HUGS)) to everyone!!",

Our weather is warming up this week to plus 5, seems a bit odd for January, but I won't complain. It will be a slushy week! Glad your mom is doing well. Traii and Nihahi enjoy the tennis, I have never been a huge fan, tried it as a teenager, pulled a muscle and that was my experience....never picked up a racket after that. Dakota and Carlads hope your SE are tolerable, Benny good luck on Wednesday. Edi I get a good laugh reading your posts, you girls sound like chefs..makes me hungry. Keep the snow shovel handy.....you may need it still.. Liefie you are so lucky to be living on the island, I am assuming Vancouver island since you head off to Victoria for treatment. I met my DH on the island many years ago. I thought I would point out I have been on tamoxifen since Dec, 5th, and haven't noticed any SE .....touch wood..I did have lots of night sweats while doing AC. I did #8/16 rads today half way, skin is still looking pretty good..I will be very happy when it's over, I have met some very nice people though in the waiting room. Well everyone have a safe Tuesday",

My first IV I had just above my wrist and I ended up with a bruise that was embarrassing, looked like I had been manhandled...all the others have been good though. Benny make sure you see the dietician as soon as you are able, you need to keep up your strength. Nahiha your pictures are beautiful. I was going to write that I haven't really seen any wildlife lately and then on my way to rads I saw a moose in a neighbours yard this morning. It surprised me as I haven't seen to many moose this year...I love to see them just not on the highways. Everyone stay safe....and have a good week!",

That does seem to be a bit of a wait for surgery, I had my surgery exactly 1 month after, and that felt forever... Have you spoken to the surgeon about your worries? Getting everything in order house wise is a good idea, for the dark hours ask the doctor for a sleep aid if you need it. I was given a low dose lorazepam as I broke out in a nervous rash after DX. Take care, you are not alone. Benny, carlads hope your okay. Traii hope your arm is feeling better. Off to rads, 14/16....boob is feeling a bit sore, and a bit pink but I can do this. 2 more after today!! Have a super fantastic day everyone!",

Love the pic of you and DH on Christmas morning! Nihahi I take my coffee black, and I would love a Timmy's apple fritter or chocolate long john! Sounds like we are going to have fun. Websister I understand your position. Benny will come back to us when she is able, I do not believe she would hurt herself. She has too much to be here for, She loves her Diamond and Benny. Benny we can hardly wait to hear from you girl! Some adventure you must be on! Traii I checked out gummy sharks....they are big, does your DH fish his own or do you buy it at the market? Everyone have a great day",
