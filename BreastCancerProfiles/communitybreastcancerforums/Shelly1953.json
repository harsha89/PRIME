Good Luck with your decision.",

This is just my outlook.  You have to do what's right for you and your wife. Good Luck, Shelly",

Don't be a wreck! Anything you've haven't had before is scarey!  After you have it you will be saying to yourself what was I so worried about!  You'll come through it just fine. Shelly",

As for Dr. saying low tolerence.  Bullsh*t.  You had a part of your body removed.  It's not like having a gall bladder, etc. removed because something was wrong that you felt...you felt fine before the op.  So you are going from no pain to alot of pain.  Take the pain meds you were given and take it easy.  It was an operation after all.  AND it sounds like you might be doing too much \"I get out quite a bit\"  Again, take it easy.  Schedule reconstruction when YOU want it. Good Luck, Shelly",

But couldn't always drink it.  Water can cause nausea!  Get gatorade light or pedialyte to help keep your electrolites in balance.  I could mix water with any of the Crystal lights and that would work.  Also, coca cola (regular) will help with nausea.  Take a small glass and stir the bubbles out.  Sip slowly.  This got me through all the days I was reacting to the chemo.  But, don't drink just the coke, you need liquids without caffeine.  Liquids will also wash the chemo out of your system faster and help if you get the foggy/dizzy feeling. 5.  Eat small amounts of food every few hours instead of regular size meal.  This will also help with the vomiting.  Some people absolutely lived on popsicles.  Can try that. 6.  Most importantly, ASK FOR HELP and be insistant.  I kept telling my doctor and nurses that I was prone to panic attacks and had to go into deep depression before anyone would do something about it.  I actually quit chemo.  Was crying all the time and staying in bed.  Finally got Zoloft and decided that I HAD to do this.  Finished the four chemos that I had left.  Wasn't a walk in the park, but the above things helped.   When you get low remember to say this is killing the cancer so I can live!  Don't be a \"victim\" like I was at first, be a fighter.  Say to yourself \"I am doing this.  I'm going to get through this and kick cancer's a$$!  Not the other way around.  You can do this!!!!! Sorry this is so long, but I hope it helps.  Hugs, Shelly",
