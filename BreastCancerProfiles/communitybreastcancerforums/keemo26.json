Place mixture in a bowl, cover and refrigerate for at least 30 min. or overnight. Shape mixture into smooth ballsabout the size of a wallnut. at this point, the meatballs may be fried in a skillet of hot oil, for 1 or 2 minutes on each side, or they may be baked on baking sheet, spaced about an inch apart, in a hot oven at 400 degrees F, for 10 minutes.

Guess I am a Southern Cali wuss! Oh well. Edi - so sorry about your situation with your son. I have taught fitness classes for many years and have had the opportunity to work with lots of people who needed a bit of help to get motivated. I guess my take away would be that it is really and truly painful to admit that you have let your weight get out of control. It is even harder to try to change - what if you fail? Talking is tough becuase you aren't going to tell him anything he doesn't already know. My suggestion would be to find a gym that offers a wide variety of classes and really supportive instructors. Then you can come to him with a solution (if you can afford to make it a gift, that might be nice - 3-month trial). All he has to do is show up - that is the goal, nothing more. Just get to the gym 3 times/week. It sucks in the beginning but if he has alot of weight to lose, it will come off quickly at first. If he would go for a walk on days he doesn't go to gym, that would be awesome! There are great people out there that will support him 100% on this journey. Sorry for all the unsolicited advise. This is something I care deeply about! Traii - if you like Grey's Anatomy, you have to check our Private Practice!  Hope everyone else is having a rockin day! Stay tough, Dakota!

After the 6th or 7th, I started getting a rash and my skin was leathery at the infusion site, which became my hand becuase my veins were shot. I was prescribed Pregnasone which I REALLY hated but took. I ended up taking it for almost 4 weeks. I had to skip a week of treatment because of the rash. During that time, my onc said that she was going to research whether or not she could still give me the Taxol. So, I showed up for round 9 and she said she would not give me any more Taxol but that the rash was caused by the cremafore. Taxol doesn't dilute with water. The rash was bad - I made a super hero name for myself \"RASH GIRL\". So, she said that she thought I could get one megadose of Taxotere and be done. Only problem with that was she wasn't 100% positive I wouldn't get a reaction at time of infusion. (While I now this sounds scary, we were all laughing hysterically at the next part). She said, let's just go for it. If you have a reaction, we can give you epoi and you'll be fine. So, we went for it, I got the mega dose and all was well. The rash took a bit of time to go away but it did, as did my chipmunk cheeks from the Pregnasone. My family forgave me for my horrific roid rage and life went back to normal fairly quickly. My long term side effects from the Taxol are neuropothy, but I deal and it hasn't impacted my life in any way. Hope that helps.

I left her office in tears after she told me all about the TRAM and DIEP flaps and how great they were but I was too thin to have one. Then she proceeded to say that she would remove the left breast (with cancer) first and that I would be lopsided becuase it would be hard for her to match the natural sag of the other breast. Nice! I would come back for additional surgeries until they were relatively the same. I asked about taking them both off and she said it was not necessary so why do it. I was with my bff Beth and we left speechless. I did some research and found a new PS that everyone raved about. I met him and the experience was ENTIRELY different. First, he gave me a hug when I walked in and said he was sorry we were meeting under such terrible circumstances. We talked for a long time before he even looked at my chest. When he did, he said that if I cared about apearance, which I did, he would take them both off, place expanders in whihc would be slowely inflated during the months of chemo. We would make sure I got to the size I wanted to be (and we talked about that thoroughly), no bigger or smaller. We did the replacement to silicone implants before rads. He used alloderm and said that there should be no damage to the implant. He and the RO talked etensively.  Point is, there are good docs out there that get this and show compassion. Your stories make me so angry. I wish there was a place to post a list of crappy doctors! xokim",

I have truly enjoyed reading through all of the posts and learning about such a strong, funny and corageous group of warrior women! I finished treatment in October 2012 and, with the exception of daily Tamoxifen, I AM DONE!!!! I posted for two reasons - first, if I can offer help in any way, I have been through it all, and second, I think it is good to get out of the immediate and look at this as a trip with a beginning and an end. It really does end - at least the stuff most of you are going through right now ends. Sure, there is always a cancer thought that I have yet to distinguish, but as time passes, it takes up less of your energy. You ALL can do this!!! Some tricks of the trade - I may become immediately unpopular with this suggestion but will make it anyhow - medical marijuana is the wonder drug for cancer treatment. My onc was fine with it (as were most of the nurses ini the chemo room). They have strains specifically geared towards people going through chemo so no drugged out stony feeling, just appetite, no nausea and no headache. It made a HUGE difference in mitigating my side effects. Dry skin or during rads - lanolin. I know it sounds (and is) gross, but it really works. My rad onc swears by it and actually provides her patients with big tubs of the stuff. If you do use, don't wear a shirt you care about as it stains.  Happy to answer anything if it will help. Good luck and get-r-dun!!!!!  xoxox",

While the road to get there is nuts, once there, the beach is great. Liefie, that is awful about your credit card. hoping the bank was good in helping resolve it. Traii, you do look young. Guessing you ARE young! I definitely think your hubbie should sport a pink wig for chemo! That would put a big smile on everyone's face!  Had my Dr. appt today and she said I was fine and that it is common to have some discomfort with implants. We decided I probbly did too many push ups and need to take it slower. OK. I sooooo loved seeing everyone at the cancer inst. You will all probably feel this too when done-  you miss it almost.. Certainyl, you won't miss feeling crappy, but the chemo, rads, peole, etc become such a huge part of your life that when over, there is a loss. make sense? I was so happy to see everyone! They wee all so excited about my hiar - yep, I actually have some!!!!  Good stuff! Going to relax and probably fall asleep on the couch! Love to all of you wonderful peeps! kim",

Hope you listen to the good advice about taking in some additional fuel before asking too much from your poor body. It takes time but you will be back in action soon and can come visit me in sunny Cali for beach riding! Dakota, I am so sorry you have to deal with such an idiot stick. It is pretty telling that when he was needed most, he missed the ball. His loss! And speaking of balls... nihahi, ebi. Traii. you gals crack me up! I definitely vote for the rum balls! Lol! Traii. Scary reading about the fires but glad you are safe. I love hearing your stories about your son and hubbie. They are lucky peeps. Diva.

I had my blood taken yesterday to check my Vitamin D levels and I guess they want to see eveything else. I had been putting it off but my MO said it was important to monitor Vitamin D. Guess I will have to do some research n that one. I haven't called about the results cause I figure if something isn't right, they will call me, and it has been such a short time since rads ended that I don't want to know if something isn't jiving. Feel like I should have a period of just living life. Fingers crossed! Scottie and Scouser - I hope you do launch the cockroach! Guessing he's never had to tangle with the likes of you two, and get Traii in the mix! OY! He is really in for it! Liefie - I get it about the eating! At east you are eating fruit! Good on you! I liked ice cream. Happy to meet all of the new sisters and lots of love!  Dakota - you are strong and you kids are lucky to have you as a role model for what NOT to accept from your partner.  Benny..... I always think about you when I ride. I've been loping a bunch and I think we have gotten past the bucking thing. hehe Hope everyone has a restful evening or se-free day - wherever you are.  xoxokeemo",

Anyhow, thanks and I will keep reading and keeping up with you all. I do hope Benny is okay. I have felt so bad for her throughout. I ride horses too so was hoping that some equine therapy might help but unfortunately, this crap hits everyone differently and she is sure getting a bad rap.  One thing that I think helped me was that I have a 14 year old daughter (13 when I was diagnosed). I was so worried about how it would effect her that I put alot of energy into being as uneffected as possible. Teen years are already rough so having mom walking around with no hair and a barf bag in the car (yes, I ws a puker), was tough, but I kept on smiling and said \"it's better than the alternative\" - do you like the blue wig or the pink one better? HAHA Being alone, as Benny has said she is, makes it tough... no one to drag you out for a walk or tell you that a bath after several days might not be the worst thing! If I lived close, i would visit! Anyhow, so looking forward to learning and sharing more.  p.s. - regarding headaches - it is a major side effect with Zofran. I couldn't take it for that reason. I preferred barfy to headachy.  xoxo Kim",

Once you and your dr. put a plan together and you are an active participant in your journey, it might not be all roses and butterflies but at least you are moving forward. Someone on this thread says \"keep on keeping on\". I think that is a perfect mantra. You can get through this... xoxoxoxo Okay - for the rest of you - YUCK on the mooseballs. Although I did find a peanut butter, cookie-like thing that sounded okay. :)",

I just got home from riding Shiny and thought about you and how much fun it would be if you could visit and I could take you riding on the beach. It really is super fun! I am actually going to get a little help with her tomorrow - yes a lesson! She likes to buck when asked to lope (canter for you English gals). It isn't a big buck and she isn't trying to dump me so I'm not too worried but I would like to correct the behavior (she is new to me), so we get off on the right foot. She is really great and I rode her bareback in a halter today so she isn't a bad girl, just gets excited when asked to move out.  Dakota - Awesome that Valentine's Day is your last chemo. It is my one-year anniversary for my surgery (feb 15 2012 - boob wack off). I am soooo up for a virtual toast. Caitlin - PM me and we can exchange phone numbers. I'd love to talk with you. I have been through the ringer and I'm still standing! Oh, sorry - I sund like a weird 80's song.  Love to everyone else and websister - tomorrow is the day! Can we all be in your pocket? hehe xoxoxokim",
