I have a rare bleeding disorder and I felt having one at a time would be less invasive for me, than having both done. I also just found out last week that I had the option. So many decisions and so much to research. I am trying to take one day at a time. I have been a emotional wreck from one day to the next, then I get my composure and I am good.

I am nervous about the SNB and the radioactive injections to my areola. I also was told by a Anesthesia Doctor at pre op that they wake you up in the operating room and you may still have your tube down your throat!? What? I didn't read too much into it. I have woke up in the operating room 10 years ago for my hysterectomy, but I don't remember anything, just that I woke up and they were finished. I also had sedation for my surgical biopsy a month ago and woke up at the end, when someone told me that they had to put my binder on. I am thinking this is protocol and I won't know if the tube is still in or not. I don't want to remember that part. I dislike the groggy feeling and the nasty taste in your mouth after.",

They then marked probably bengin.  I went another 6 months with the same.  I then went a year, with the same no changes they remained stable.  I have been going for a year the past couple and everything is still unchanged and stable on my right breast which I was told.  The focus is my left breast per my Breast Surgeon at this time.  I had a total hysterectomy at age 30 with taking hormones for almost 9 years and stopped last November.  I am doing well without them.  It amazes me the different opinions physicians say about taking hormones.  It was my choice to stop at age 39 and I am glad I did.  I only go to reputable sites.  The computer can make you sick if you go elsewhere and not reputable sites.  I just need to get my mindset right and continue to pray and remember God is in control, and will take care of me!
