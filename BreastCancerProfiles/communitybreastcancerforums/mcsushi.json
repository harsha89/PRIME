I was originally diagnosed at 30 stage IIIa and last week found out the cancer has returned to my lungs, pleura, and nodes. I'll be starting Ibrance (palobciclib) within a week or so along with lupron injections and femara (which I started last week). I've been having a tough time with controlling a massive pleural effusion in my one lung so they'll be putting in a pleural catheter to help manage the fluid build up instead of a weekly thoracentisis. I'd love to hear from anyone currently taking Ibrance or anyone with pleural catheter. I'm not sure what to expect with either. I can't say I'm happy to find myself here again, but I know I'm in the company of some amazing, strong, and well-informed ladies. For that, I am grateful. Strength does not come from physical capacity. It comes from an indomitable will. ~Gandhi Dx 2/8/2010, IDC, Left, 2cm, Stage IIIA, Grade 2, 8/21 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Dx 8/14/2015, IDC, Stage IV, metastasized to lungs/other, ER+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

After about a week though, it was like it wasn't there. After 8 weeks,I'm down to 600mls (woo-hoo) and will probably have the catheter removed in a few more weeks (more woo-hoo).
