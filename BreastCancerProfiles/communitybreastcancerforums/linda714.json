I haven't ever done chemo. In 1996 had breast cancer lumpectomy and radiation. In March 2014 could swallow food or doing. They did a endoscopy and found a lymph node in chest putting pressure on esophagus so they stretched it and no problem at this point with that but they said it was breast cancer metastisized in that area. Didn't even suggest chemo . Since it was er positive it needs to be treated with hormone suppressor Letrozole combined with the trial drug. Been on that since June 19th. I done know if its working but sure getting side effects, neutropenic, rectal bleeding, skin rashes itching and just worry and sadness. Get scans next month. Did you ever get advised about these hormone suppressants? Linda :-):-) smiles to you.",
