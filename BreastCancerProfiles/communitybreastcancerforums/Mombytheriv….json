I have heard that it takes all of 8 weeks to get back to normal but I am feeling the same as you. I do have skin sensitivity and pain - especially under arms and on sides of breasts. Everyone has said to take the time to heal and I understand that this is completely normal for this surgery so I am trying to be patient. I am so glad to be cancer free! Hang in there - we will get there!",

The OT told me that standing in front of a mirror and rubbing lotion into the skin while looking at it helps the brain to make the connection. The issue seems that the brain has a hard time determining between \"light touch\" and pain while the nerves rejenrate I am 5 weeks post surgery and that feeling is nearly gone. Hang in there.",

I am so ready to get the next (hopefully last) surgery behind me. Rushing in to the first surgery was so much less concerning for me as I just wanted to get the cancer out of me. Now that this is ahead of me I am more nervous than having the bilateral mastectomy. Very strange. I am thinking of each of my sisters on this. Board as you go through each of your surgeries. Stay strong and be kind to yourselves. This will soon be behind us all. Hugs hugs hugs",
