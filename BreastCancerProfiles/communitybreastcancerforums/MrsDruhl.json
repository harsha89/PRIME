As soon as the OB walked in she made me feel dumb for coming as I will be starting my cycle the end of the week. Told me if I had talked to her she would of told me to come 5 days after cycle. She said she would still fill the lump. She started to fill around and found the lump I came in for. Her response, \"this isn't going away.\" Like what does that eveN mean? She said she thought it could be a cyst, but it has no characteristics of a cyst. It's a really hard quarter size hard rock like lump above/behind my areola/nipple area. It's pretty big. Doesn't hurt or move. I am freaking out. I currently have two cousins fighting breast cancer. The object just really doesn't feel right! I go next Wednesday to breast health! I just feel so uneasy and just want this stone object out of me",
