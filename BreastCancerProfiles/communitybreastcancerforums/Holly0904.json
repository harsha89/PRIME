I looked up what the dimpling might mean and it took me directly to IBC which also included the tenderness, but a myriad of other symptoms I do not have as well. I don't really think that's what it is, but everything I was reading was telling me to get it checked out asap, so I got a little more concerned. I also looked up different images of other women who had dimples in their breasts, and several looked exactly like what I have going on. Reading your ladies comments has helped plenty though, I'm much more calm and convinced that I will wait until my appointment and get it checked out. I haven't noticed anything other than the dimple and tenderness, but as I said in my original post, that could have been because of my cycle starting. You have all helped more than I expected, I needed someone who is experienced and not google to scare the pants off of me! I almost always over react, so I'm glad I posted here to calm myself.",

I went to my doctor last week and she did a manual exam, said she didn't feel anything out of the ordinary, but referred me for an ultrasound as a just in case. I just got home and although I'm not really nervous, or as nervous as I was when this all started, I am wondering about how long it takes for the results to come back in? I know every case is different, but I'm wondering what your experiences were?",

No other pose shows it and I have found no lumps, bumps, or anything else, but googling is terrifying me! I got my period the same day I found it, and never have had tender breasts before, but they have been tender this entire week, almost feeling irritated the way they did when I was pregnant and nursing. I have scheduled an appointment with my PCP, but she can't see me until July 25th and everything I'm reading on google is telling me that it could be IBC and that I need to act fast. I don't quite know why I'm posting here, maybe for advice or maybe just to get it out to someone besides my husband who doesn't seem to be worried, but I'm concerned. I'm 26 and never would have thought to check if I wouldn't have had a swollen duct when I was 16 that I had to get taken care of. The doctor I saw then showed me different ways to check myself in the future, which has brought me to today. I have been checking every day and just looking to make sure there's no changes, and so far everything is the same. a little less tender in both breasts, but the dimpling is still there and still the same. No lumps, no bumps, and it's near a stretch mark but not a part of it. I'm worried about waiting for an appointment, but wondering if it would be an over reaction to go to urgent care. I am a worrier and tend to over react, and my husband seems so calm about it, so I don't know what to do. Log in to post a reply",

I knew in the back of my mind I was overreacting, but with my anxiety level that high, I knew there wasn't going to be too much I could do to calm myself, so thank you all! I'm going to keep an eye out for any other changes, and unless I see something else concerning, I'm going to wait till my appointment. I'm glad I didn't go off the rails and run to urgent care, thank goodness for you ladies and a husband that's always calm and rational. I'll be sure to check back in after my appointment and update you all. Thanks again ladies!",

Like I said earlier, I tend to over react to simple things, so this terrifies me and I wanted to get advice from other people who have more experience than I do before I jump the gun. I probably should stop googling and just wait for my appointment because I'm sure google is just enhancing my fear and helping me over react. I'll definitely call and see if they can alert me to an opening or cancellation, thanks!",

I do have a history of breast cancer in my extended family, but not my grandmother or mother, so that is slightly comforting. If I saw this dimple anywhere else I would assume it was cellulite and move on. I don't have an OB that I can see sooner, and I could only get in with my PCP in a couple of months, so I'll just have to wait it out and try to be calm in the mean time. I'm hoping it's nothing or something easily remedied, but your comments have helped more than anything i have told myself, so I thank you!",
