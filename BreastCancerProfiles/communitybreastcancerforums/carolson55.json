The oncologist told me that this pain might continue for another 3 years and I should take aspirin for the pain. Have others experienced pain for so long after surgery? Do you know of other options to dealing with the pain? The thought of having this pain for another three years is depressing. Thanks in advance. Carol Log in to post a reply",
