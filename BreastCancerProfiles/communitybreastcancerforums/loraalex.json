    "Content": "loraalex wrote: Hi I recently found a lump in my left breast on the inside of my chest a few inches away from my sternum and I swear it just suddenly appeared, as I have never felt this before. The lump is like a round marble thats moves when I touch it, but isnt painful. Ive been to the doctors who said the lump is about 1 cm and hes refered me to the hospital to have an ultrasound. I am only 22 years old with no history of breast cancer in the family and ive just recently had my first baby who is 9 weeks old and im not breast feeding so I dont think its a blocked milk duct, so im very worried about all of this and I have a whole week to wait before my hospital appointment :( Laura Log in to post a reply",
