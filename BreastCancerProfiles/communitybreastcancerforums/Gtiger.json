The others were in the lumbar region. I am hopeful.",

Afterwards, I had scans every three months. Surprisingly, all the lesions \"healed\". I have a strip of dark skin on my back, but otherwise didn't have skin problems. Had lots of fatigue and nausea. Those lesions have NED; however, unfortunately I have two new lesions to my thoracic spine. I am half way through 15 rad. treatments for those and have the same side effects; nausea and fatigue, but no skin problems. I don't mind radiation. I had to stop Afinitor/Aromasin combo. because of serious side effects. I was thankful to be able to have additional radiation treatments. I am a recreational pilot and could not fly on the A/A combo. I've been able to fly with another pilot on board while receiving radiation. Not sure what we will try as far as chemo. after I finish the Rads. but am enjoying this time when I can fly. Radiation has been my friend.",

It was a beautiful sunny day until we flew past a huge forest fire in the mountains of north Georgia.  It looked like a forest so I'm hoping no one lived anywhere around it. It appeared to cover several hundred acres on the very tops of the mountains. My husband tried very hard to get me to fly, but I haven't been able to focus. But.... I do love Tory Burch shoes and just got inspired to go shopping something I think I can focus on!!",

      "Content": "Aug 7, 2013 05:35PM - edited Aug 7, 2013 05:37PM by Gtiger Teena, I was first diagnosed with BC in 1997 with a 5 cm tumor and 1 positive node. I did a year of aggressive chemo but no radiation. During that time I too had a sister diagnosed. We both tested positive for a mutation of the BRCA 2 gene. I took care of her until she died 5 years ago while I remained cancer free until October 2011. In Oct. 2001, I was diagnosed with bone mets to my spine and left shoulder. I received radiation and was on femara and xgeva until June of this year when I had further progression to my spine. Radiation was wonderful and got rid of all of my pain. I am unable to take any narcotics so I was so thankful for the radiation treatments. The femara and xgeva was effective in preventing progression for almost 2 years! My quality of life has been good enough! Since the new lesions on my spine which were diagnosed June 2013, I have been placed on Afinitor, Aromasin and continue to receive monthly Xgeva injections. I can't say that it's pleasant but I'm willing to move on to anything that will fight this disease. I wish you all the best with your choices.",

I was pre-menopausal and had a 12 year old daughter.  I took care of a sister whom I lost to BC. Didn't receive stage 4 diagnosis until Sept. 2011. I lived with severe back pain for a year but it never occurred to me it was cancer because everyone said I was \"cured\". I finally begged my internal medicine doc for a referral to an ortho surg when I could no longer pull my tiny plane out of the hanger. The surg. did an MRI and discovered the tumors which were a complete shock to my oncologist. I have numerous mets to spine and shoulder which are greatly improved with radiation and femara. I love flying and spending time with my \"grand\" dogs. I'm looking forward to grand children but that hasn't happened yet. Don't post much but have deep admiration and respect for all who share their wisdom and hope.",
