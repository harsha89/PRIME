I have history of ADH and ALH on the left breast, lumpectomy in 2008 and diagnosed with IDC, 1.5 mm. I was offered lumpectomy with radiation but I opted for BMX with sentinel nodes biopsy. Just today I had another biopsy of an enlarged lymph node on the diseased side. It could be inflamed from the biopsy I had on March 29 that diagnosed the IDC but my doctors want to be sure. They said the surgery strategy would be different if that node comes back positive. It all hit me like a ton of bricks although I have been tested and watched since the ADH and ALH. I would have some type of test every 6 months but somehow it slipped undetected.I am trying to mentally prepare myself for what awaits me.",

I absolutely love my breast surgeon, she is great, she did my lumpectomy for atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) and atypical lobularÂ hyperplasia (ALH) in 2008. The plastic surgeon she works with has very good reputation and just because she likes him so much I trust him too but I don't feel him either. His nurse is even worse. At the first visit the PS told me his office will call me back in 48 hours but to give them a call if I don't and ask for his nurse. I did that and left a message for her. She called me back the same day but she had an attitude like \"why do I bother her\". My next appointment is on the 7th and I hope it's going to be smoother and I won\"t feel like I'm keeping them from something more important. All the other ladies in the office are so nice and helpful to compensate for the dr and nurse. But maybe they are very busy and don\"t want to waste time if not necessary and they are good at what thery're doing but they lack in \"bedside manners\". I do vent here because like somebody elese was saying, my family and friends are sick of hearing it although they don't show it.",
