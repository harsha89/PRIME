I am just concerned cause she has also been complaining of pain behind that breast in her shoulder blade and back.  Now, I have felt her back and they feel like knots, but her physical trainers at school as well as myself cannot get the out and do not think they are just knots. Are these related in any way? She has a doctors apt next Friday, she's from NJ, but is living up her in CT and her insurance won't cover an apt unless its in NJ. Do you think a week to wait is too late?  Thanks again Beesie, your advice was very comforting.",

She is in CT with me but lives down in NJ and is not going to see the doctor till next friday. I know she is worrying, she told me last night she is scared. Her grandmother had breast cancer when she was in her 20s, and survived. She is still living today, but i need to be strong for her and I know that we do not know anything yet. I've just never had to deal with this before. Any advice? Log in to post a reply",
