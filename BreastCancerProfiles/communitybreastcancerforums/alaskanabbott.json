I have had two previous mammo's, not for any reason other than that I get told repeatedly that my breasts are \"markedly fiberous\" and I have a small family history. (Grandma and both aunts had BC, grandma and her brother both passed from colon cancer). My breasts feel lumpy, like grapes- my whole life, I have pretty thin tissue too, and not much \"stuffing\" left. I nursed all 6 kids- last one weaned 8 years ago. So for about 2 years I have started having milk leak just a teeny tiny bit from the right. Had a test to check prolactin last year and everything was fine. I assumed the little BB in the left was pimple- I get these weird little pimple things under the skin. BUT DH thought I should go have it checked, and it's been about 15 months since my last mammo and breast exam so I did. OBGYN felt it and wasn't worried, but thought we would mammo it just in case. THEN she did the exam on the one that has the milk leak. The nipple is retracted or inverted, I can't figure out what the difference is. Basically the nipple folds in on itself and won't come out, for NOTHING! No pulling, tugging, nothing gets it out- believe me, OBGYN tried!! She asked when that happened and I can't really remember. I don't think it was that way when I had my last exam about 15 months ago. Obviously not that way 8 years ago when I was nursing. It seems I noticed it a few months ago. So DR is much more concerned by a silly nipple than my lump- which feels like a good thing, lumps make me nervous, nipples not so much. I have not had any other problems with the retracted nipple except for some itchinf every once in awhile. Nothing insane, just gets a wee bit itchy. I figured it was related to the bit of milk that leaks. When I say leak I use that loosly. It almost never even spots my bra, but more smells sour, like bad milk, and sorry for the TMI, looks a little cottage cheesy in the fold of my nipple. SO here is where I'm confused. 1.Dr said we are doing a diagnosic mammo. I'm not sure how that differs from a regualr one. 2. Are dense breasts and fiberous breasts the same thing? What do I need to know about fiberous breasts? 3. Dr is also sending me to a general surgeon. What should I expect there? Should I waitto see the GS until my mammo is done? If the mammo comes back clean, which I am almost 100% sure it will, should I still go see the GS? and if so what things would I want to discuss with him? My mother is passed away, and I don't want to bother my friends with this for 2 reasons- one, none have any experience, and two- I'm sure there is nothing and I don't want to worry anyone.
