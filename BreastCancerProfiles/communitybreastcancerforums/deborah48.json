I was dx'ed in May this year and after two surgeries, I was told that I should go for a DM. I was, (Shocked, to say the least). I have NO cancer in my very large family. I am 48 and even though my breast were heading south, they were still mine and I liked them. I cried about loosing them for a long time.I also worried about waking with out my breast. To be honest, I think because of the pain meds and healing time, the lack of breast didn't hit me until days later. It has been about a month now. It has'nt been easy, but I will say that I am getting used to it. I had a Bi-lat with expansions. I now worry constantly what the final results will be. I try to look on the bright side, \"I can choose not to wear a bra\" and I am CANCER Free!!! One more thing, my best friend was dx last year, she had to go with shoulder flap due to radiation and I will tell you that she LOVES her results..... Your in My Prayers and know that you are not alone even though it may seem that way. God Bless",
