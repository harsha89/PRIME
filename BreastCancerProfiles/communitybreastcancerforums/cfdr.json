It certainly makes sense to me that the more advanced the cancer or larger the tumor, the more likelihood of symptoms. What does NED stand for? elimar, I don't know that there is ever anything resembling a distinct pattern when it comes to this disease. And certainly at Stage IV you have a very wide range of how much, and to where, the disease has metastasized, so I would expect the Stage IV group to have even less consistency. I also read that if you have a 1cm tumor (about the size of mine), you have probably already had it for about 5 years. But I also don't know enough about how a tumor might cause fatigue to know how much size is a factor. A small tumor can be more aggressive than a large one, so I wouldn't assume that a smaller tumor is less likely to cause symptoms than a larger one. According to the article I read (which is here: www.mayoclinic.com/health/canc... \"some cancers release proteins called cytokines, which are thought to cause fatigue\". It doesn't go into any more detail, though. I'll be asking my onc about this at my next appt, on 12/9. I'll let y'all know what she says.",

I also talked to a counselor a couple of times; at Duke the sessions are free for cancer patients. I hate the idea that I need psych meds just to function normally, but I like functioning normally more than I hate being on the meds. The counselor I went to told me that 25% of cancer patients suffer from depression, and that it is very common for the oncologists (at Duke, anyway) to prescribe antidepressants to their patients. At least now when I can't get off the sofa I know it's because of the chemo, and not because I've lost the will to get up off the sofa.",

I also started on lexapro a week before chemo; it's an antidepressant but also works on anxiety. Definitely been having fewer freakouts. Hate to turn to pills to manage my emotions, but this is not a normal situation so I'm OK with it.  Also, saw a post on facebook recently that called the Wizard of Oz the ultimate chick flick...two women fighting over a pair of shoes. Terry71--Did they give you topamax? I considered going on that as a migraine prevention, but decided against it. But I did notice that it is supposed to help with peripheral neuropathy, which can be a chemo side effect. Although hips are not exactly \"peripheral\" so I'd think your bone pain was from something else. I'm curious what kind of eye problems people are having. The only thing I've noticed is that sometimes I get almost blinded by just looking out a window or up at the sky...it's like someone has just taken a close-up of me with a flash camera. Big white blotch in from of my eyes for several minutes afterwards, can't see a thing. ",

I work for myself, at home, which makes this a lot easier in many ways. I never had kids, didn't marry until I was 50, and career was my primary focus for 30 years. For 20 of those years, I worked in very demanding \"real\" jobs, in media and high tech. I suffered through many a work day with a migraine, or severe menstrual cramps, or allergy attacks, or in a brain fog from the antihistamines for my allergies, or simply exhausted from working 14 hours a day and sleeping 5 hours a night. I determined that I would NOT do that through this. I stopped taking on new clients as soon as I was diagnosed, and have gotten down to working only a few hours a week. It makes money a bit tight right now but it's do-able.  My focus is on being happy, healthy and unstressed. If I'm not productive or responsible right now, I'm OK with it. There will be plenty of time for that in 2012 and beyond. Even with what's considered an excellent prognosis, there is still about a 1 in 10 chance that I could be dead in 5-10 years. At the very least I want to take these 3 months as a mini-\"retirement\" in case I'm not around in 16 years to enjoy my real retirement. I'm being very self-indulgent: doing needlepoint when I should be vacuuming, reading a book when I should be working on a client project. I'm doing my best to actually enjoy this time and not just have it be another slog to get work done when I feel like crap. I am in awe of those of you who are able to keep working full time and/or raising children through this. I wish you all sympathetic bosses and indulgent husbands who will make this as easy for you as possible.",

I've been working for myself for 7 years, and although it has many perks, it has been more stressful and less lucrative than I'd like.

On the internet, nobody knows you're bald. ;-) Also considering if this is the time to make a big life change...try to do something more artistic, start a completely different business (I have a gourmet food line I've experimented with and friends have encouraged me to try and market it), or try to apply my skills to a non-profit cause that I'd find more inspirational. Originally I'd planned to spend my time on chemo doing a lot of hard thinking and business planning, but in the thick of it I've found that I don't want to think about it at all...I want to be as happy and unstressed as possible during this time, and I am confident that when my strength returns I will have the enthusiasm to pursue whichever path shines the brightest.  Anyone else contemplating major life/career changes after all this?",

Maybe just say that you're very tired and can't really get out much, but also aren't up for any elaborate entertaining, but could they pick up some take-out and come by one evening?

I have tried several solutions: Belisse compression bra, $297, covered by insurance: great for compression, but the thick elastic along the bottom of my ribs bothers the costochondritis. I can't wear it at all anymore. WearEase compression tank: ~$79: decent compression, especially for a mild case like mine. Fabric is thick enough to mask the nipples under a light shirt. Has a seam under the breast line which can irritate my costochondritis, but not as much as elastic. Underarmour long-sleeved t-shirt: not really adequate compression, and doesn't mask the nipples very well. But it's better than nothing. Around $30. Spanx tank top: Compression is tighter around the waist than the breast so it doesn't really work. Also, rides up if it's not tucked into underwear, and sometimes even if it is, so I rarely wear it. Sleeves are less important to me because I don't have arm issues, however, I would love to have both tank and long-sleeve options. White, beige, black would be the best colors. Something that has thick enough fabric to mask the nipples is important since we can't wear bras. I'm relatively flat chested so I don't need any more support than I get with compression; perhaps some other women can address that aspect. Thanks for asking our opinions~",

My oncologist was very good at explaining the arithmetic behind the risk factors. She showed me how much my chance of recurrence percentage was lowered by surgery, radiation, AI, and what additional benefit there would be to having chemo (I did have the chemo). As others have said, it is not just an equation of your risk of recurrence, but also of the chance of side effects that could be just as bad: not hair loss or yucky fingernails but heart damage or leukemia. At some point, the risk of life-threatening side effects outweighs the benefits of a reduced recurrence rate. Count yourself lucky!",

Also been having some mood issues: getting ridiculously upset over very minor things, having difficulty concentrating. I started lexapro last Friday; hoping that will help with both depression and anxiety. Onc says that anecdotally it sometimes helps with headaches, and since the increase in mine is probably due to stress, I hope that will be the case for me. I breezed through 6 weeks of radiation...little to no fatigue, some redness and soreness but nothing terrible. Right after radiation was completed, we moved to a new house. THEN all the side effects started. My rad onc had told me \"no heavy lifting\", so I avoided carrying boxes as much as possible, but the 1000 little motions of moving things in and out of boxes really irritated the area where I'd had the boost. Ended up with a moist reaction and a big blister. It was actually more painful than the day after surgery had been; one afternoon I just took an oxycodone and went to bed. Once the blister popped I was able to use Mediplex dressings (about $11 each!, but they can be reused a few times) to keep clothing from irritating the wound any further. Also kept slathering with aquaphor at any opportunity. At this point I think all of my bras, t-shirts and bedsheets sport aquaphor stains. Had the chemo orientation last week; I had learned most of the side fx stuff by then, but it was good for my husband to hear and be able to ask questions. We also got a tour of the treatment area so we know what to expect. Each area has a TV; we decided to forego cable in our new house, so he's excited that he can watch the baseball playoffs during treatment! I'm looking forward to beating his ass in Scrabble while he's distracted by the TV. I took the Look Good...Feel Better workshop last week. It's good to take prior to starting chemo...I didn't realize that makeup and makeup applicators can be a source of infection, so if you are at risk of infection, they show you how to use disposable applicators to use makeup hygenically. Also taught some neat scarf tying techniques. You can go to more than one, if you go to a second you have to bring your own makeup, no second set of freebies. I may go again once I lose my eyebrows for some help learning how to draw them back on. I'm not usually much of a makeup person but with no hair or eyebrows I'm thinking some makeup may help me look human again. Good luck to everyone getting their first tx this week...with mine at 2:30 on Friday I'm guessing I'll be the last of the week! Is anyone else here getting their treatments at Duke?",

My husband got to see the baseball game on the TV and I beat him in Scrabble, too. :-) Saturday and most of Sunday were fine...even had friends over Sunday afternoon. Some intestinal cramping but no nausea; did have one small bout of diarrhea today but so far that's been the worst. My docs gave me zofran and dexamethasone to take for two days after; I've also been taking 1/2 an ativan before bed, mostly to knock me out and because I've found it's been helping to prevent morning migraines. I did have a migraine morning after the tx; knocked it out with 50mg of sumatriptan. I have a scrip for compazine but have not had to take it yet. My onc is one who doesn't do the neulasta first time out...so I'll see how that goes. Planning on avoiding all public places Thursday through Sunday. Nonetheless I felt very achy today after only 20 minutes on the treadmill. Also having a fair amount of pain where I had surgery and radiation (I had my rads before chemo). They had a pharmacist meet with me prior to treatment, which was really helpful. It was great to talk to someone who was not only familiar with all the cancer drugs, but was informed about how they might interact with my asthma and migraine drugs. The oncs sometimes seem to forget that patients may have other conditions going on other than cancer. One thing he said was that if I take any kind of pain killer (ibuprofen, naproxen, aspirin, tylenol) to make sure that I don't take doses back to back, but have time in between to take my temperature. He said there's a danger in taking pain killers that can also mask a fever and make it more difficult to detect an infection. Sue, I feel for you with your alpha female friends. Whenever I read one of those \"inspirational\" stories of a woman who went through BC treatment without ever missing a day of work I just want to scream! It's been emphasized to me that every cancer, every treatment, and every patient is very unique. I also feel that I'm undermining my treatment if I try to do anything right now other than allow the chemo to work, and stay as healthy as possible to prevent side effects. The rest can wait!",

As far as time, the zaps themselves around only 10-45 seconds, depending on whether or not you have to hold your breath. But it takes some time for them to position you in the machine.That plus waiting room time and changing time, it was usually a 20-30 minute visit. But once I week I'd also get my vitals and see the doctor and nurse, and once a week they would take an x-ray and sometimes redraw the marks. So those visits could take closer to an hour. As far as side FX, I breezed through to the end...little to no fatigue, red skin but no blisters. I did 33 tx, the last 8 being \"the boost\" that focuses just on the incision area. I did get some breast pain (the onc called them \"zings\") but nothing long-lasting or severe. I also got a bit of swelling along my side, which the onc said could last as long as 6 months. And I had a sore spot on my ribs, just below where the actual radiation ended. My onc advised me not to do any heavey lifting because of the latter.  A few days after my last treatment, we moved. And no heavy lifting! So I just put things in and took things out of boxes. But that was enough to TOTALLY irritate the boost area. I got a \"moist reaction\" (which usually only affects big-breasted women, which I'm not) as well as a blister on top of it. Good thing I work at home because I went around the house topless all week long, and was smearing on aquaphor about every 4 hours. It was so painful I took an oxycodone one afternoon and just went to sleep. Once the blister popped, the onc nurse gave me some dressings (mediplex? I forget) that I could use. I found some more at a medical supply store--they were $10 each but worth it. So the moral of the story is...baby your babies, and don't think you're done with symptoms by the last treatment! As guilty as I would have felt, I should have not helped at all in the move. All that movement and friction really irritated things.",

I'm also doing an alcohol-free mouthwash at night (ACT is the brand) that my dentist recommended. This is also supposed to start the low point for white blood cells, so I'm staying in all weekend.

I got some witchhazel pads that helped a lot. Start of the next cycle I'm getting some Tucks medicated pads, and spending the big bucks on Charmin.

Sunday morning DH and I had a fight...he was annoyed because I couldn't give him a timetable of when I'd feel well enough to accompany on an errand...and I yelled at him that I was sorry my being sick was such an inconvenience to him. So he COMPLETELY avoided me the entire day. And this is the morning after I'd been running a 100 degree fever, because I have swollen throat glands on top of the chemo sfx (I was already annoyed at him before the fight because the night before, he balked at the idea of taking me to the ER if my temp continued to rise). Even on a good day, he has yet to come in the room and ask if I need anything. He says that he has made dinner for me every night, but it's just not true. A couple of nights he's prepared dinner I couldn't stomach so I've asked him to just heat me up a can of soup or leftovers, or he's cooked so late that I've just grabbed something myself. I've lost 5 pounds in 10 days. Last night he wouldn't even speak to me so I was on my own to prepare dinner....after 4 bouts of diarrhea and swollen glands all day. I feel really abandoned...and told him so this morning. I am sorry I yelled at him, and told him so, but then I got hysterical again. I am feeling physically and emotionally about as low as I ever have in my life. I hate feeling sorry for myself, and I hate feeling needy, on top of all the physical crap. I wish I was at my sparkling best and could handle all this with utter grace, but I'm not. I'm exhausted and short-tempered and in pain. Is it too much to ask for him to overlook my being exhausted and sick and unpleasant, and be there for me anyway?",

My prognosis is excellent, but not 100%, either.  I think he just wants everything to be completely normal, and treat me like I just have a bad cold or something. He's great about picking things up at the store, but if he's not hungry it won't even occur to him that maybe I should eat and don't want to wait until 9:00 to do so. So I end up having to ask, and feeling needy because of it. But he does better with clear direction. I'm thinking it may even be preferable to have a plan for each day or evening ahead of time so we each are on the same page. On the good news side, I felt the most energy I have in a week!

Terry--I imagine a full mastectomy is scarier than a lumpectomy, on many levels. I did have a second surgery, but it was just scraping out a little more margins, so it was even easier than the first. No drains or hospital stay, though. I hope your surgery goes smoothly and is pain-free. I found that it was most difficult dealing with people right after diagnosis. That's when I got all the pitying looks that I just couldn't stand. Now that I'm in chemo and my diagnosis is old news, they just seem happy to see me whenever I'm out and about and feeling OK. The one thing that *really* bugs me though are things like a facebook conversation between some of my friends the other day.

I'm pretty much recovered from that so will probably start up again this week or next. I hope you make great progress. My pneumonia symptoms are mostly gone, but the f/u xray report was curious. Showed that there was still what appeared to be pneumonia, as well as no change in the pleural effusion (fluid that collects in the bottom of the lung). Some of the findings were said to be \"worrisome for a pneumonia\"--whatever that means. My PCP's plan was to follow up in another month with another xray, then do a CT scan if there was no or little change. I had the reports sent to my onc: both radiation and taxotere can cause lung inflammation, and pleural effusion can be a symptom of BC mets (which I consider unlikely, but still...) I don't want to wait another 5 weeks to find out if there's something going on other than pneumonia. Haven't heard back from my onc yet but they may not have received the films yet, either. Question re: uterine cancer. I'm not on any particular follow-up plan for any gyn tests; what I was told is that mets is usually brain, liver, lung or bone. Is it just a particular kind of BC that tends to spread to the uterus or ovaries? My follow-up plan is for a mammo and and MRI, 4-6 mos apart, for two years. Lost 1/2 a fingernail today. Fortunately it had detached so much it didn't hurt at all. My husband was totally grossed out.

The PT who evaluated me said it can be anywhere in the ribs, not just by the sternum. She said there was a small bit of swelling but didn't think lymphedema was a big factor in the pain (although it could be contributing). More likely, it is a late side effect of surgery & radiation, probably compounded by the fact that I've had problems with my shoulders and therefore haven't been able to do my usual yoga/stretching. She said the entire rib cage is \"tight\" on that side, not expanding as much as it should when I breathe. She gave me some exercises to do, and I'll see a PT the next 4 Mondays to try and work on breaking up some of that stiffened tissue. Ironically, I *just* finished PT for my shoulder this week. Just when I thought I might get to go a whole week without seeing a medical professional!",

After recovering from that (two rounds of antibiotics because the first did nothing), I started exercising aggressively. All was well for a couple of weeks, but then I got rebound fatigue...it was like being back in chemo all over again. Bit by bit I was getting better, but found I have had to be very careful about overdoing it. Then I started getting worse for no particular reason, and was found to have pernicious anemia. I have been getting B12 shots for two weeks, and hoping those will kick in any day. It's been a roller coaster. From hiking for three hours to being flat on my back; from working my first full days in months to being unable to focus for more than a couple of hours. Today I was supposed to bake cookies for a potluck and you may as well ask me to scale Mount Everest. Ain't gonna happen. I've been eating well, veggies and fruits and organic nonfat dairy; lots of water and decaf green tea. Walks in the forest, yoga, meditation. And I still have days when I'm a basket case. Wish I knew the answer. :-( ",

I was in PT for mild truncal lymphedema for a while during and after the end of chemo. I also so my onc a couple of months later for pain in lower ribs, below where I had my lumpectomy. Had rib xrays, but they didn't show any problems...the onc sort of shrugged and said maybe it is costochondritis, but that is more specific to where the ribs meet the sternum. Recently the pain has become much worse: I can't lie on my back, roll over, bend forward, or carrying anything heavy. It feels almost like a pulled muscle, but it is also very sore to the touch, like a bruise, but it does not appear swollen or bruised or discolored. Everything I read about truncal lymphedema seems to indicate that it is prevalent in the breast, armpit, back, and above the breast...not below. Does this sound like truncal lymphedema?
