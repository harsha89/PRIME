I would've never known I have breast cancer if it wasn't for the 3-D mammogram. I am forever grateful for its invention. It showed I have Invasive Lobular Carcinoma. I had a lumpectomy 2 weeks ago for a primary tumor they thought was 2 cm (and one hiding behind it) and after pathology came back it turned out to be 4 cm and my margins were not clean and invasive tumor cells in the lymph node! My surgeon says Invasive Lobular is a \"sneaky bastard\" and likes to hide. I was going to have a 2nd lumpectomy to remove the rest of the cancer but after seeing my oncologist and after he and my surgeon consulted with each other, I am going to be getting a double mastectomy and then chemo! unbelievable - I am still in shock! I really thought I was just going to get a lumpectomy and radiation and be done with it. I am in crazy information gathering mode right now so reading your posts is so helpful.  ",
