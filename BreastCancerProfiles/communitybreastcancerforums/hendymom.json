How did some of you come to your decision (if you were in the same boat)? I have a lot of cosmetic questions/concerns. Are your boobs lumpy afterward (after the incisions heal, of course)? Does the skin ever smooth out? How long does that take? Has anyone had nipple tattooing? How long after implants did you have that done? I've been very positive and optimistic about my diagnosis, and I'm making lemonade (bigger boobs)! I recently became very weepy, though, because I don't want to make the \"wrong\" decision re: single vs double. Log in to post a reply",
