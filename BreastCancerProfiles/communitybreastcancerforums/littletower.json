As you can see in my signature, lots of aggressive stage 3 cancer. I was/am in the Hopkins vaccine trial and as a result got full scans in August of 2015. Have radiation fibrosis and costochondritis from radiation. Last 4 weeks or so, much sharper and intense pain on lower right bottom rib area directly under the arm area. Onc not really into scanning again and doesn't seem concerned. I don't really want to scan either, but this pain is different. Am I being over anxious? Off to Hopkins next week for annual bloods, but Onc there is away so no second opinion there. They will do a check of tumor markers there. Thanks in advance for your help and gentle hugs to you all.
