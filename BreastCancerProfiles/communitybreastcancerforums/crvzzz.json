I have spoken with many breast cancer patients and nobody had it behind their cleavage. Has anybody heard of this and if i have a lumpectomy in this area will i stilll look okay? I don't want to sound superficial but, i want to be able to wear more than a turtleneck. Also, i am in HMO hell trying to find a decent surgeon.Any advise on how to deal with them.
