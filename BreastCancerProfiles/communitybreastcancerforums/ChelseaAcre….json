The mammo was fine, nothing new noted, but the MRI has stated the following: Findings: Breasts demonstrate significant amount of fibroglandular tissue with moderate stippled-type of background parenchymal enhancement, without significant interval changes. It may limit MRI sensitivity. A little history for you may provide some info about my journey. I'm a high risk patient for BC, due to having ADH found in both breast 5 years ago. I had the lumpectomies and am now monitored each year with a mammo and MRI. If something detected, I usually will go every 6 months, then usually back to yearly. But the results of the MRI last week showed this \"background parenchymal enhancement\". Like you when I looked it up, it appears to increase our risk for BC. My question to you both is, were you able to get any answers about the risk factor increasing even more because of also previously having ADH? Sometimes, I really feel I'm playing a very dangerous game with myself, by continuing to continually monitor, instead of having a double mastectomy. The oncologist suggest I just keep getting monitored, and would consider it a drastic measure to have the surgery. Your input would be greatly appreciated.",

I continue to be monitored with annual mammo and MRI. Should anything suspicious appear between annual exam, doctor will see me to determine if any test/exam is required. My most recent mammo/MRI appear to be very good and I'll see them in a year, which I was thrilled about. But, once I started reading report and came across new terminology that I haven't seen before, I started to research. The new term on my MRI result is that I have \"moderate stippled-type of background parenchymal enhancement\", (BPE) . When I looked up BPE, new studies show that it increases your risk for developing BC 9 fold. At my follow up app't I discussed the BPE with my oncologist, and her thoughts were it's nothing to be concerned about, but again, we'll keep a close eye on you and continue with annual mammo/MRI. Tamoxifen was mentioned to me to help reduce my risk. But, like so many of you, it's so hard to make the decision as to what direction with treatment, surgery, etc...to choose. At times I feel if I can physically handle the surgery of a bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction (DIEP), I should go for it and put a stop to this constant roller coaster. To the oncologist it would be a drastic measure since it's not a cancer diagnosis, but an indicator to increased risk for developing BC. In closing, you're all in my thoughts and we all struggle to deal with this disease each day. Any input would be greatly appreciated.",

I do agree with you about the care we receive and if anything is found it would/should be in the early stages. I try to remind myself of this everyday, so I don't worry myself silly. I actually have a follow up app't at Princess Margaret (Toronto, Canada - It's our Cancer Hospital) on Monday, where I'll be sure to have a great chat with my oncologist. Take care,",
