It's really sweet of you. :) Yeah. it's probably just the anxiety talking, but it's the chronology of events that puzzles me. - The cyst was aspirated for cytology in mid-May. It didn't collapse back then. (And yes, the cytology was mostly done because of my family history and because of me sitting there all nervous and crying. The radiologist said they'd do the aspiration in a case like this mainly if the cyst was painful, if there was BC in the family, or if the patient was very anxious.) - The cyst was still visible on ultrasound in late July. - But as of today it now longer can be seen on U/S. So it must have disappeared at some point between August and November. I've always thought that cysts would either collapse immediately after aspiration (once happened when I had a large, painful \"regular\" one aspirated) or not collapse at all, but not over two months later. But maybe that was just a wrong assumption to make??? Sorry, I'm overthinking things again. And yes, I've started seeing a therapist lately. The anxiety got so bad that it became debilitating. Which is ridiculous as plenty of doctors did tell me not to worry and I was not diagnosed with breast cancer at all. I think it's my inner control freak who wants to dot all i's and cross all t's. Twice. ;)",

So I would infer from that recommendation that it can take some time for a cyst to collapse. Yes, your description totally makes sense. Thank you for taking the time to clarify this . I'm really sorry that you weren't as lucky, though. I see from your signature that you were diagnosed with in-situ BC in 2002, so I do hope you are all better now and continue to be happily cancer-free. Again, thanks for your understanding. I felt a bit guilty for barging into a BC forum when rationally speaking, I should be throwing a party right and actual patients have so much more to worry about. I think your advice to focus on what I know instead of what I fear is very helpful, as I'm the queen of imaginary worst-case scenarios. So I'll try to do that and to be truly grateful for those results. ",
