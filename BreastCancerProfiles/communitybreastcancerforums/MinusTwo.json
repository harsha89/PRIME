It is my understanding that damage from Herceptin usually repairs itself. However if you have Adriamycin chemo, any damage is permanent. That's why I started out with Taxotere & Carboplatin with Herceptin & Perjeta added. Since I did not have a complete response, I did have to do Adriamycin & Cytoxan after surgery. MO did stop the Herceptin for the period I was doing the 'red devil', and then started again once my heart was deemed in good shape.",

I'm more fortunate than Special K in that while they freeze 15-20 precancerous lesions every 6 months, I've usually only needed one biopsy a year . And fortunately the last three years have been negative. I expect that means I'm due again this year since my last chemo (protection) was 2014.

I laughed and suggested her other patients wouldn't appreciate the \"cure\". ipsy - I would definitely insist on the MOHS procedure with a derm plastic surgeon. And I concur that you'll likely be there most of the day. With each basal cell I've had removed to examine micro sections, they had to go back to cut more to get clear margins. But at least you're done & won't be called back for the same spot.",

Most were much smaller in diameter, although some turned out deeper when the Mohs was finished. I thought a basal cell was always infiltrating, although I may be wrong.

He is paying to go to derm doc outside the network for a full body scan once a year since he is at significant risk. He then hopes to take that report to his PCP and by virtue of that, coerce the PCP into providing a recommend to a derm specialist if necessary. Sounds like you're lucky to even get to a derm doc. I understand your sarcasm & agree. Glad it's not \"high risk\". If you can't somehow get the MOHS, it looks like your next best option is excision with a surgeon.",

I made a tactical error and bought the 50 lb bag of fertilizer last week. That was definitely not pleasant. And I have the stores bag my groceries in paper & pack them tight.

That means it's larger, you get to use their towels, and since it's right next to the medical center, they validate your parking. Not a bad benefit since medical center parking is REALLY pricey (like up to $5.00 for 30 minutes). Anyway my membership doesn't cover the extra amenities, but the nice man at the desk said I could walk today as a trial. I don't need a more expensive membership at any of the 4 locations that are closer to me, so I just won't plan on going to this location between doc appointments. I'll walk around one of the hospitals. My LE/PT told me today that I shouldn't vacuum the entire house in one session. Really it's only a lightweight Shark, but the repetitive motion apparently caused some swelling. (truncal & breast). Maybe this is a good reminder why I haven't vacuumed in a long time, and I should continue to give it a miss. Silver Sneakers again tomorrow and then a lovely Japanese Bento box lunch with my SIL. If I'm really motivated, I might walk on a treadmill at the gym close to the restaurant after we visit for awhile. Or not.",

Most lamps are more than one lb. Yes, the heat didn't help, but probably 10 minutes would have been enough \"moving\" for one day. It's REALLY hard to learn to back off & shut it down when we've always done these things. Why is it that you have to have a custom sleeve & glove? Length? Girth of the arm? I have a custom sleeve but OTC sleeves often work as well or better if the measurements were done by my LE/PT & not something I tried to measure myself. (or the clerk at Walgreens)",

I was diagnosed with mild truncal LE on the left side - after having only BMX & SNB on both sides. At that point I got a Belise compression bra & sleeves for flying, got a few massages and went on my merry way. Two years later when my cancer recurred, I had to have chemo & ALND surgery & radiation. The BS still wasn't really hearing me but finally said \"OK go see these people\". I went back to the wound care/LE doc and he said PLEASE don't go there - they're not really trained. But the RO (radiation oncologist) immediately picked up on the problem - now right truncal & breast - and sent me to MD Anderson's trained LE PT group. It's made a real difference in my life - in terms of breaking up cording, training me to do MLD, and helping me order the proper compression bras. Even though I'm 3 years past rads, my RO is happy to write a script for me to go back as needed every 6 mos or a year for refresher training and to pick up on the new technology. As other's have written, I continually have to exercise to keep the muscles flexible and the lymph flowing. It's a pain in the neck, but it does make a big difference to have trained support.",

I don't require it very cold, but didn't want to be walking in 95 degree sun & come home to an 85 degree house. Luckily by the time I got home at noon the power was on.

I live in hurricane country and have lots of flashlights & emergency lanterns & radios, however I hadn't changed out batteries in a couple of years.

I really don't want it to continue into my arm(s). Therefore as a preventative, whenever I fly I wear sleeves and gauntlets. I also wear sleeves and gauntlets if I'm doing lots of repetitive activities with my arms. I also wear a compression bra 24/7. My goal is to stop progression - which may or may not work but has for 5 years so far. No - doc's don't usually discuss or give out info about LE. Doc's don't usually know much. One report from a Stanford doc said that in 4 - 10 years of medical school, the average instruction about LE is less than an hour. (I think he said 15 minutes, but I don't want to over state). When I asked, my BS and my PS both said pooh, pooh. After my first surgeries, I took myself to a doc who specialized in wound care and LE. He diagnosed mild truncal LE on the left and recommended a compression vest/bra and sleeves/gloves for flying. After the 2nd surgery (ALND) and subsequent radiation, the RO recognized it immediately on the right and sent me to a great LT/PT specialist. I'm sure other members will chime in. If you haven't seen this site yet, do spend time reviewing & reading. We must do whatever we can to protect ourselves.

Most standard medicare policies pay at least half (except for Blue Cross apparently), and most of the HMOs or PPOs that I've seen often pay in full. I pay $200 a year to belong to the gym. Even if I do absolutely nothing else there, these classes work out to be less than $2.00 each. You don't have to be 'old' either. Lots of our class members are under 50.

He suggested taking the insole out of my existing New Balance or Merrell shoes and finding a shoe repair place to cover it with suede. Not leather mind you because it's too slippery - suede. He also gave me some temporary arch pads, but the problem is not my arch, it's the ball of my foot. The only shoe he recommended was Geller, and when I ask what would be the next shoe down just a notch in price, he said nothing really. He liked the one that is $379/pair. Ouch. Anyway because I was disgusted, I bought a new light weight shoe. They are Nike-In-Season TR5, with comfort sock liner & memory comfort footbed. They were on sale at Academy for $44.00 so the shoes were less than 1/2 the cost of the darn doc. Back to exercise. Voila - I was able to increase my treadmill time from one mile to 2 miles today - no blisters. And I increased the speed from a 20 minute mile to a 17 minute mile. Woo Hoo!!

I probably can't sustain this level if I need to do anything else in my life, but it was a good jump start out of the recliner. My LE PT was delighted today to see how much difference the Yoga stretches made. On the more effected side, my arm was only 3% off full range of extension when extending over my head. The other side that suffered broken arm & frozen shoulder is not so great, but it still increased 5 degrees more than last week.

Other than bathrooms & supply rooms, there are is only a porch (or portico) so of course no A/C. I was up there by 8:30am and was still there at 6:30pm last night while a bunch of contractors did needed repairs - plumbers, electricians, locksmiths, fence guys. I trimmed bushes & trees, posted rules for the new year, scrapped 'mud wasp' nests from ceilings to baseboards, walked around & around the outside fence picking up trash & reviewing the repairs, stocked TP, emptied skimmers at the pool, stacked chairs, moved bags of mulch, threw away tons of 'stuff', etc. The high was only 85 yesterday and there was a nice breeze so I just kept steadily moving. This really is the opposite of a whine. I was up there 4 'half days' earlier in the week when it was MUCH more humid. At the end of the day I was amazed that I apparently had a good bit of my stamina back. I am really grateful that I can \"go & do\" again. Of course it's not like installing a new roof, which I wouldn't try anymore because of the repetitive hammering. But hey...I made the whole day and really wasn't even dragging until after 6pm. Maybe I can become somewhat of an \"energizer bunny\" again - or at least his distant cousin. Added benefit - I didn't stop to eat so I lost 2 lbs. Yeah, it's mostly water, but that's 5 lbs for the week.",

I did have a pretty virulent staph infection once from scratching a bite that got infected from the normal staph germs always on our skin. Cellulitis usually begins as a small area of pain and redness on the skin. This area spreads to surrounding tissues, resulting in the typical signs of inflammation -- redness, swelling, warmth, and pain. A person with cellulitis can also develop fever and/or swollen lymph nodes in the area of the infection.

As an amusing aside, I even wear a compression bra in the swimming pool for water aerobics. Supposedly if I keep my body under the water over my shoulders, I shouldn't need it because of the gravity differential. But I recycle an older 'fushia' bra under my bathing suit.

As for my MO - he isn't a big fan of artificial \"things\" in the body, but said I could make my own decision. One comment he made that I found interesting is that some women are better able to put the entire cancer experience behind them and move on more easily when the port was out. Well, I did that the first time & had 2 years before recurrence. Now I tend to be more pragmatic about keeping the port. Not depressed or anxious or worried about \"when\" it will come back, but realistic that maybe the port is a valuable tool for me. My son's comment was that I might worry less over-all with the port instead of constant fear of aggravating the LE - which is unfortunately already a continual painful condition.",

It's hard for me to commit to a structured class every darn day. But next week I'm planning to start a water aerobics class 3 times a week at our subdivision pool. Since two of those classes are in the evening & only 3 blocks from home, it should be easier to manage. I can just come home, hop in the shower & settle down to a light supper.

I know conventional wisdom says you can't make up the loss of sleep, but I still seem to be able to run at full tilt for a couple of days & then collapse for a day. Monday night I couldn't get to sleep until 3am & some stupid trucker trying to schedule a delivery woke me at 6am. (wrong number). It was my day to see the MO at the med center so I couldn't go back to sleep, even if I could have convinced my body. But 3 hours is NOT good. I left the house at 9am, ran errands before & after the doc and didn't get home until 4:30 pm. I'm rarely in bed before midnight, but I was out for the count by 11pm and slept until the alarm woke me at 9:30 this morning. I probably could have slept a full 12 hours, but I promised myself I wouldn't miss Silver Sneakers this week. Too bad that I have to go for appointments early both Wed & Thurs. Oh 2FUN, I have to remember you do that every day. So sorry to complain. Now that I'm retired I often sleep past 8am.",

Unfortunately my AARP/United medigap policy is cancelling the fully paid benefit for gym memberships effective Jan 1st. But since no one knows what they are doing yet (including United Health Care), my key card worked just fine. The memberships are not being cancelled for the HMO/Advantage policies, only those with standard medicare, which leads me to believe \"they\" are trying to get everyone to switch. Not this lady. I love my existing docs. I love being able to see whoever I need w/o a referral. I love having access to places like MD Anderson & Mayo Clinic. I was furious and spent two hours on the phone in November trying to find out why this program would be cancelled when everyone knows we have an obesity crisis and all the docs are emphasizing how critical it is for seniors especially to get up off their butts. After 13 phone calls, the only thing I could learn was that not enough people used the benefit. Hells Bells - of course they didn't because it was never advertised. I paid for my own LA Fitness gym membership for 2 years w/o realizing that it was actually covered in full by my AARP/United insurance. As was a membership to the YMCA or most other gyms. Now supposedly the insurance will pay 50% of what ever one location charges per month. Dumb. Of course monthly rates will be higher and the gyms will want to charge my bank account every month.... And of course now I can't take classes at LA Fitness and swim at the YMCA (which has a warmer pool) Not to pick on United. And not to mention that I'm told this only involves a few states - such as Texas & Tennessee - and the rest of the country still has the benefit. BCBS medigap policies (in Texas) never paid for it in the first place. They only offered the benefit for their HMO policies. Sorry for the rant. Thanks for listening. If you're on medicare - do check out the Silver Sneakers program with your insurance company. Maybe you'll still have this benefit. The classes are amazing & you are encouraged to slow down if you need to or just do what you are able to manage. Lots of people come when they are recovering from some injury or other. Not to mention it includes full membership to a facility for all their classes & equipment.",

When I got tired, I got on a bus & rode for awhile in the direction I was headed. Or I stopped for lunch or a glass of wine. Perfectly lovely time. I can walk forever - just not very fast because of the neuropathy. And boy were my calves sore because of the hills. Houston as absolutely FLAT. Had a great time.

I must admit I don't do it every day, but I do go to a chair yoga class where I get lots of good breathing & stretching, and Silver Sneakers classes. And I love the Tai Chi breathing exercises. I wear sleeves & gauntlets when I fly - again as a preventative. My therapist measured me & ordered for me. I put them on before the plane departs and leave them on for 30 minutes after landing. I also try to wear them when I'm going repetitive or heavy duty exercise. I also wear a heavy duty Belisse compression bra when I fly, and again leave it on for 30 minutes after the plane lands. Otherwise I wear a a lighter compression bra 24/7. I use the Wear Ease Sydney Bra.

I was doing great for awhile until I fell & broke my arm last March. Unfortunately that was due to CIPN & feet that feel nothing. After that I got really nervous about walking because the ortho told me if I fell again it would be major surgery/pins/plates/etc. I started back on a treadmill late last year. Somehow even with new shoes I got horrendous blisters on the balls of my feet. And of course I couldn't feel them until they were broken & oozing. (sorry TMI) I do have an appointment to see a podiatrist next month. I hope he has some ideas because I've really become a couch potato. And I am going to try a \"silver sneaker\" class this week w/a friend. Yeah, I know, funny.

I am wearing my compression bra and doing MLD in the evenings. Hope that's enough.Gardening in sleeves in Texas is not happening. I found an interesting article about plumarias recently - in after Easter, out before Thanksgiving. I just yank them out of the ground and toss them in the garage for the winter - no dirt, no water. Last year I didn't get them planted until May and they already had leaves & a bloom or two sitting on the shop floor. I swore I would give them all away this year, but here I am getting ready to stick them in the dirt again. They just grow like weeds, and yes they smell so lovely. Most are now small 'trees' and way to big to manage by myself.",

I have never had a problem with this bra riding up. Also I live where it's extremely hot & humid, so less is more.

My therapist said no-no to Wal Mart sports bras. I have an expensive Belisse compression bra that I use for travel for flares. If you can, I would get fitted locally even if you plan to buy one on line. For every day I use the WearEase Sydney Bra #780, which my LE therapist loves. I wear it 24/7 - even in the swimming pool for water aerobics. I did not find the long line compression bras comfortable - especially with our hot Texas weather - so again, it's good to try before you buy - although Wear Ease has a wonderful return policy. https://www.wearease.com/collections/all?page=2 There are also some compression T's that work. Again, I found them too warm for Houston.",

I started back up just before rads to complete the 17. The most important thing is to get your complete records. You have a right to those and your new docs will need them to determine future tests or treatment. Many MO's do blood tests for tumor markers. My doc did the tests regularly but said the results are not very accurate - only an indication that other tests need to be done. Seems like the \"new\" protocol is to say - \"OK you're cured, go on your way\". Since I've already had a recurrence, that doesn't make me very comfortable. It's very hard to learn to move forward and I doubt any of us will ever stop worrying at some level. My favorite test is a PET/CT. The nuclear dye causes any hot spots to light up. It's expensive and has a higher dose of radiation than some others. That said, my original MO retired and the new one doesn't want to do much testing so I'm sort of where you are. I expect I'll start jumping up & down & yelling when I'm one year past the last treatments. If you haven't, do get a reference for an LE trained therapist. Just learning the massage techniques is a big help, and getting fitted for proper sleeves, etc. There are a couple of great LE threads on BCO. Try \"Grrrr...\" And the following link is a good reference that most of us with LE use. http://www.stepup-speakout.org/ Sorry for the reason you have to join us but welcome.",

Drugs like Fosamax (Actonel, Boniva, Zometa) that can cause osteonecrosis of the jaw scare me to death. Evista increases your risk of stoke & blood clots in the leg, lung & eyes.

Funny - my spine was great at the last DEXA scan but hip had horrible bone loss w/chemo. One of my nightmares is falling & breaking a hip. So many older women go to nursing homes after a broken hip & never come out. Sigh. Thanks for listening. HoleInOne - I agree. Docs who think of us as cancer survivors don't understand BC prognosis - or don't have a clue how to talk to patients. I can deal w/NED or remission but I'd be angry too.",

You an always go back for an ALND based on what the SNB shows. You can't keep second guessing what tomorrow might bring or your quality of life will be lousy. You make the best decision you can and quit second guessing. That said. in your position with positive nodes AFTER chemo (if I understand correctly), I would have them take more nodes. But how to you know if they are still positive w/o a biopsy? That's the only sure way to diagnose. .ALND doesn't necessarily mean all or 10 or 30. I had an ALND after my recurrence. There was only 1 node positive on the right and she only took 7 total. (that's in addition to 3 clear SNB when I had my original BMX) Good luck with the surgery.

Most important, if you are really that anxious, call your PCP and get a prescription for anxiety meds.",

You can hopefully keep LE from progressing to other areas if you take all the correct steps to \"promote & protect\", (see the link below) and you can try to avoid a flare up, but if LE does progress, you will always have it at that new level. And unfortunately LE can rear it's ugly head anytime once your lymph system is compromised - even after 30 years. \"If you've been treated for breast cancer, you are at risk for lymphedema of the hand, arm, back, and chest or breast on the affected side.

The good news is that you can reduce that risk by understanding a few important principles and the safe practices that follow from them.\" I do work outside & I do heavy work, but I built up to it slowly & I wear sleeves. And sturdy garden gloves. I do travel & fly all over, but again - I wear sleeves.

Yesterday I lost all my right eyelashes.  I'd been using Latisse since last April when chemo started.  I kept lashes & brows all through Taxotere/Carbo/Herceptin & Perjeta that ended 8/7, as well as a couple of stand alone Herceptin/Perjeta.  Then surgery the end of September.  Then the tumors hadn't shrunk enough so more chemo in November - Adriamycin & Cytocan.  I fell so crappy the month of December that I didn't use the Latisse.  The third AC was 12/11 and the fourth one cancelled due to SEs.  I started Latisse again the first of the year, but obviously too late.  Left eyelashes are still great.  Eyebrows are still fairly thick.  Weird.  And it makes me angry at myself for not following through. Then today I lost 3/4 of my left middle fingernail.  Looks truly horrible.  Again - I'd iced during Taxotere (which ended the first of August) and had no problems.  This nail always had a split going towards cuticle so I had a nail shop repair the tip w/super glue & put on a light coat of clear acrylic last November.  It had grown out at least 1/2 way and was doing OK but started turning bruised colors about a week ago.  So yes - AC did hit the nails too.  Double damn.  The other nails are still a bit weak & brittle & peel back some, but are growing nicely. As for the head - I've been so cold that I haven't really taken a look under my various caps for awhile.  Hair had started growing back before the 2nd chemo - then I just gave up & lost it again.  I already have a light fuzzy burr on top.  Too little to see much but you can feel it. Guess I need to get on Biotin.  5000 mcg per day, right?  Can you take that during radiation? Thanks again for letting me vent.",

I'm battling a continuing fungus under those two nails, that look warped & mis-shapen & feel more like horses hooves. It's my understanding it may take a year for fungus to be killed as they grow out. I use clear RX cover every day & antibiotic drops twice a day. I always had hard fingernails. They got soft & brittle, but are now finally hard enough not to split, peal back or break - basically a year past the end of Herceptin. The only lasting effect seems to be pronounced ridges.

My new PCP seems to think the answer to nail problems is TEA TREE Oil.  She said it would soften my nails.  She's testing my blood for Zinc levels due to brittle nails.  She also recommended Lamisil for any 'loose' nails to make sure no fungus grows.  Since I'm trying to get them harder & less brittle (not softer), I've started using Healthy Hoof.  I expect the Herceptin will keep them in transition.  I'm still losing the nails on both big toes.  And the 3rd fingernail on my left hand may still come off.   But I have very dark hair growing on the top of my head - used to be light brown & grey.  After 1st chemo it came in mostly grey.  I lost it again w/2nd chemo which ended 12/11.  I had January off but started Herceptin again in February.  Unlike many who have posted, I seem to have a lot more hair on top than on the sides.  Weird.  I'll be wearing hats for awhile since I'm always cold.  No underarm hair to speak of.  Sparse, fine,straight public hair - totally different.  Not much hair on my legs but what's there is 1/2 - 3/4\" long.  Unfortunately most of the chin & mustache hairs that I spent years getting removed w/electrolysis seem to be growing back. ",

It would be good if you stay off google. Lots of the info there is not only old but often wrong & definitely scary. Lots of good info on this site.

Week one done.  Weird when you start on a Thursday.  I had reconstruction 2-1/2 years ago after original BMX and my radiation is for recurrence w/node involvement.  Coming after two different chemos and axillary node dissection I sure agree w/the \"poison\" comment but I'm told I'll get another 25% protection w/radiation. Reporting on what I have learned the first week:  I guess I have to drop my control issues and just look at this as my current job.  One day they took me 15 min early.  The next was 30 min late.  Today there were machine problems so it was 1-1/2 hours late.  I was given a shirt today that the hospital guild makes.  It looks sort of like 'scrubs' but has velcro down the front & both sides.  It's an alternative to gowns so you can come straight from home to the room.  I'm too cold so I'll give it back for someone else to use.   I will see the RO every Wednesday.  I will have new X-rays taken every Thursday - I guess to make sure we're on track but there are no tumors left to see, so who knows what they're tracking.  I did see the mapping and the graphs today.  Really interesting. The plastic piece that covers my chest is called a \"bolus\" to draw the radiation closer to the skin because I had a chest wall recurrence and skin is considered part of chest wall.  I'll have that every other day for 2 weeks, and yes it will supposedly burn the skin worse than regular beams.  I do have nine (9) zaps (or beams) with EVERY treatment - some super clav, some whole chest, some with cones to focus the rays.  I forgot to ask her today what they were focusing on.  I do know they will be hitting all level 2 & level 3 lymph systems.  The damage to my right lung will hopefully not be more than 25%.  Of course that's on top of my years of smoking.  I'm using Miaderm and also have 100% Aloe Vera gel.  I may add Aquaphor on top like TeamKim is doing if the skin gets bad.  Thanks to whoever recommended a throw away shirt.  Once I put on the lotion, the 5 colors of permanent magic marker on my skin bleed onto the shirt.",

I did not have a complete response, so I drove myself again every 3 weeks for another 10 weeks for another set of chemo infusions. And a Neulasta shot the next day. Then I drove myself every 3 weeks for the rest of a year for Herceptin infusions. In the mean time, I drove myself to a different medical center an hour the other way for rads every day for 5 weeks. I always took a book and was very comfortable being by myself. It gave me quiet time & I didn't have to worry about entertaining someone else. Try to go when it's not rush hour traffic. Make sure you have a back up someone to pick up your son from school or summer camp, as there will be times you won't get back as scheduled (pump breaks, blood tests not ready, double scheduling for the nurse, whatever) If you're not comfortable with the route, maybe you can drive it with your DH on the weekend or at nights to practice. You can do it.",

I would not want to be put to sleep by someone who could not answer my questions and put incorrect information on my medical chart. It is not too late to get a second opinion before any more surgery, and maybe you'll move on to a different doc. Your MO consult will probably give you some good ideas & maybe recommendations for different surgeons. I certainly agree with the post about the tumor board. I interviewed two surgeons and also two MOs when I first had only a DCIS diagnosis. I picked my own MO who was involved from the beginning. He pushed things through the tumor boards.

      "Content": "Feb 11, 2014 02:10PM MinusTwo wrote: OK winter radiants - I'm moving ahead finally.  Appointment w/the RO last Thursday.  She listened to an hour of my questions.  Mapping & simulation last Friday.  My right side is covered w/red/green/blue/black ink.  And the plan is clear tape where the lines meet.  Because I'm sensitive to tape, I told them to go ahead & do the pin-point tattoos where it was critical since I probably couldn't keep the tape on or they'd be redoing the simulation before we were through.  So I have 9 tattoos even tho this MD Anderson center doesn't usually tattoo for breast cancer anymore. I had a BMX in Feb. 2011 that got clear margins, clean SNB and exhibited only DCIS, so I went ahead w/reconstruction and no further treatment.  Had a chest wall recurrence in March 2013 - now IDC, Grade 3, HER2+,  that didn't totally respond to chemo, so after ALND surgery when the BS discovered one positive node, I did more rounds of different chemo.  January has been a rest & test month trying to build my body & blood back somewhat. Team Kim's questions were great. Given that every doc is different - here are some of her answers. I will have external beam rads to the right reconstructed breast and the \"draining lymph nodes.\" Radiation will go to midline. I will be on a totally flat table to minimize damage to the lung. They expect it to damage some of my R lung, but not my heart. They do utilize 'breath hold'. The risk of a second primary tumor at the site of recurrence is very small, which of course doesn't say anything about mets to other places. I may have a lump in my throat & trouble swallowing as rads hit the esophagus. There is a 2% chance of bracheoplexus problems. There is a 2% chance of rib fracture for the rest of my life. RO & I agreed on 50 grays for 5 weeks - no boosts, concentrating on the chest wall & the lymph nodes since I have no breasts & the recurrence was not behind the implants.  She said 60 gry was optimal for my situation but understands that I'm very concerned about: a) capsular contracture of the implant that's been in there since Sept 2011; b) lymphadema since the surgery already took all the level one lymph nodes and she will be radiating all the level 2 & level 3 nodes;  c) neuropathy since I still have some very serious problems 6 months after the taxotere chemo. There will probably be fibrosis & scaring & the tissue will be tighter, so she does expect the R implant to at least be \"pulled upward\" by that & may be disfigured.  She has personally never seen an implant that \"extruded\".  I have 11 exercises that I'm supposed to do 3 times every day - 5 to 10 reps - to keep stretching the tissues.  That said, there is a 25% chance of recurrence in the same area if I don't do radiation vs. only 5-10% if I do it, so....I'll start Thursday 2/13. I was a former long time smoker so I had a low-dose spiral CT done today to get a baseline of any prior damage to the lungs, since rads will damage at least a quadrant of the R lung.  Also ended up getting a PFT - pulmonary breathing test - to determine the volume of my lungs pre-rads. She recommended pure Aloe &/or Aquafor to start.  Because of my skin, she also said Miaderm would be good.  I will get Silvadene if my skin gets really bad.  She recommended using 3-4 times a day but not more than 4 hours before treatment.  She did not agree with my derm doc to use Elocon once a day as a prophylactic for radiation dermatitis - so we'll hold off on that. She approved my re-starting Omega 3/fish oil but NOT Vit E, or any other high dose antioxidants (Vit A, C...).  She approved the 5000 mcl of Biotin in addition to my regular supplements - Centram Silver, Calcium, Vit D, Vit B6, Vit B12, Acetyl L-carnatine. Her most ardent recommendation was DRINK and don't get dehydrated.  Of course that's a problem for me, but I'll keep trying.  Of course the consent I had to sign has LOTS of scary side effects that it says may be worsened by chemo or surgery before, during or after rads.  Hmmm - got it all going for me. The best part was - after the simulation & mapping she came and stood by my head while I was still in the 'mold' and asked if I had any other questions.  I laughed and said \"wasn't an hour's worth enough yesterday?\"  My RO is definitely not just a physicist.  She's a doc w/a great bedside manor & lots of patience.  And wants me to email her personally if I have any other questions or concerns. Sorry for the length but wanted to share all the info I received.  I promise to be more quiet going forward unless I need to whine. Peaches - I had Herceptin April thru September 2013, stopped for surgery & then had to stop because the 2nd chemo (Adriamycin) is also very toxic to the heart. Just started herceptin again 2/5/14. I also had to put everything off for a week in the first round due to low blood counts. I've never heard that the days are that critical but I will be asking.",

Finished week 2 today.  RO seems to think skin is great.  I'm using only Miaderm so far.  She did remind me to be sure to do the stretching exercises at least once every day. RE: Implants & continuing changes to skin, tissue, muscles - she said that I could expect any tissue changes to be MOSTLY finished after two years - but reminded me that rads is the gift that keeps on giving (yup, she really said that). EDITED to add - she did say most of the 'burning' effects to the skin would continue for around 2 weeks after rads.",

You were referred to a cancer doc who won't talk to you because you don't have a referral. What is a cancer doc, or do you mean a breast surgeon? I can't imagine why you would be seeing either medical oncologist or a radiation oncologist at this point. What did your OB/gyn say? That is of course the first line of inquiry for female issues. So wading through all the deleted posts, it looks like you have an ultrasound scheduled on Friday.You should make an appointment to meet with the doc next week who ordered the tests so you won't have to wait too long to get in to discuss the answers.

There's also a difference in how the dose amount can be reduced if neuropathy becomes an issue. It also depends on what other chemo drugs are prescribed. I don't believe they ever use a taxane drug at the same time as Adriamycin, although my taxotere was combined with carboplatin. I wish my MO hadn't retired, or I'd email him.",

Crissy started this thread for people who have serious concerns about mets to Stage IV. Many of us have had recurrences, and all of us are nervous about every ache & pain for a long time - maybe forever - but there are lot of other threads to discuss our aches & pains and what general health plans we want to follow through out treatment & beyond. It's important that you make an appointment with your doc if you have on going concerns. I think we need to respect our Stage IV sisters and only post serious mets questions that we've already tried to explore on the regular threads. I'm not meaning to pick on anyone. Crissy, please let me know if I'm incorrect. This thread has been on my favorites since my diagnosis & I read it every day.

That said - you can do it, but I'd recommend you have help for that first week & don't try to take care of your cat's by yourself.",

Pretty much everyone thought I was nuts at my infusion center when i insisted on icing. Since the icing is supposed to be 30 min before & 30 min after my 60 minute Taxotere treatments, I took 6 bags of frozen peas. One for my hands & one for each foot. They let me use the freezer in the employee's fridge and switched them out for me half way through the 90 minutes. For my feet, I anchored them in a portable Igloo ice chest & put one package of peas on top or the toenails of each foot. For my hands, I just held the peas & dug my nails in. Needless to say I kept a blanket between my hands and my lap. I neglected to ice my toenails the first time - which was of course the loading dose. The big toe nails partially detached but never came off. I didn't have any problems with my finger nails (well, related to this - since of course they were brittle & tended to split after treatment). As for the neuropathy, I had Taxotere AND Carboplatin - both with the potential to cause CIPN (chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy). My doc gave me a choice to stop or reduce the doses as my toes got more numb, but since I was already being treated for a recurrence and i was hormone negative & HER2+, I decided to go for broke. For awhile I couldn't do up my own pants, but now I have very little problems with my fingers. However 5 years down the road my feet are still mostly numb. Luckily there is no pain, but there is no treatment for neuropathy - only for the pain. My feet used to be solid blocks of ice. I have some feeling in some toes now, but I have to be very careful walking since I have no way to balance. I just let my hair go, but I used Latisse on my eyebrows & lashed. Although they thinned some, I never lost either. Sorry you're having to go through this again. Best of luck with your treatment.",

But have your wife ask someone she trusts (like her GYN) who he/she would send his mother or sister to see without any prompts. A second opinion is always a good idea and docs don't resent that.

I also went back to a previous thread (say 'fall chemo') and found lots of ideas. Hope you stay feeling well for the holidays.",

I did the same when I was getting Taxotere and had no problems w/my mouth. I see that AC also lists nail problems as a side effect.

I drew bra strap on my chest before BS installed and she managed to place it so it doesn't rub & rarely shows at all. I had it installed in 2011 and LOVE it. When I went for my last port flush & labs, they were not able to get any blood return. I understand I'll have to go to Interventional Radiology to see if they can find the blockage & cure - or get the port out. Someone said earlier their port was no longer useful to draw blood, only to put things in. I didn't know you could do that. I'm concerned about an upcoming PET/CT. Where does liquid go if there's a blockage? I'm worried about the nuclear contrast. I was planning on having the port removed after this test, but I agree about the superstition of having it there, especially since I do have lymphadema. As for the Emla, I originally discovered this magic drug when I was having some electrolysis done some years ago. I've found it works best if I put it on the port one hour before my appointment and cover with saran wrap. Press'N seal works great w/no other tape needed to hold it to your skin. Be sure not to rub it in with your fingers or they will go numb. I use a Q-tip. Patty - so glad your experience was positive.",

If you already have a lymphadema specialist, they will be able to help w/some of the protocol & pain from that issue. Basically every doc I've seen said that things will continue to change for at least 2 years during healing from chemo, rads & surgery.  From what I've been told, 70% of patients gradually get some better.  Per my neurologist, we will NEVER be back where we started so \"better\" is relative.  30% end up with varying degrees of permanent CIPN (chemo induced peripheral neuropathy).  And we know that LE can flare up even 20 years after treatment.  Some have scar tissue that can be removed w/surgery.  Some have implants removed.  Good luck in your search.",

Luckily no pain, but no feeling either - which throws off my balance and makes it extremely hard to wear most socks & shoes. The conventional wisdom says you may continue to see improvement for 2+ years after treatment ends. My treatment ended 3-1/2 years ago so I guess it's permanent.

There is always a risk of lymphedema with any blood draws or pressure readings it you've had even sentinal node biopsies. Take a look at this very informative site that some of the BCO ladies helped write. http://www.stepup-speakout.org/ I say hooray for your HER2+ reading. Herceptin is a snap and we're lucky it's available As for ports - I arranged to have my port placed by my BS. No interventional rads for me!!! Hope you can arrange that when it comes time to remove. I had all my blood drawn by the infusion center nurses through the port. They attached the \"dangles\" & cleared the lines before I went to the other departments to have CT w/contrast or MRI w/contract, etc. Then I went back to infusion for them to flush again & 'detach' me. You may have seen me write this before, but I LOVED my port. I was so grateful that docs & nurses never had to stick my arms (SNB on left and ALND on the right, so both are compromised). Now when I have blood drawn & have a huge hassle finding someone who knows how & will draw it from my foot. Same deal with two surgeries. They had to call the head nurse to start the lines in my foot because even the anesthetist couldn't do it. I do have truncal & breast lymphedema so the port was a major blessing. And lastly for showering - get some Glad Pres N'Seal. You can wrap it around your whole chest area and nothing will get wet. No need worry about just keeping your back to the water.",

There are grades of breast cancer, and grade zero is DCIS - which some people say is technically not cancer. Grade 1 is cancer. There are stages, but there would be no way to evaluate that w/o a biopsy or surgery. With dense breasts and a sister with breast cancer, I would have the MRI. But it's a personal decision. The alternative is, can you put the worry away and wake up every morning and never think about it at all for another year? Regarding the cost, talk to your docs & see if there are programs that could help. Or maybe tell the doc you don't have the finances and see what ideas they have - or if they think you can give it a pass.",

It can't be too expensive if you're having nothing else done. Edited to say - A soon as I could stand alone, I was able to take shower by wrapping my chest in Glad Press 'N Seal. I learned the trick from folks who have knee surgery or a broken arm. Once I wrapped drains & all. Truly, nothing gets wet. ",
