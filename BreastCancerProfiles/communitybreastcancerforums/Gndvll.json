I guess I'm a little shocky. I haven't cried. I've done what I've always done. I've distanced myself and started researching. I don't feel pessimistic. It's just the next thing I have to deal with. One of my daughters knows. The others are in the middle of a huge move, so I'll wait for a bit before I tell them. Biopsy next. I have to meet my breast doctor asap. I'm SO glad I found y'all. I I'll keep everyone posted. Thanks! Gina Dx 6/19/2018, IDC, Left, 3cm, Stage IIA, Grade 3, ER-/PR+, HER2- (DUAL) Log in to post a reply",

Everyone is being super supportive, and I'm so glad I found y'all, too! Let's see.  Update:  Triple neg, although my Progesterone is 5%.  We're calling it 4 cm and grade 2s, Stage 2B.  I've seen the breast surgeon, and she thinks that neo-adjunctive chemo might be beneficial, so I'm seeing a medical oncologist, plastic surgeon, cardiologist and pulmonologist.  Psychiatrist and pain management are on the list, too.  I'll also be having genetic testing. I definitely want a port, so I'm trying to get everything set up asap.  I'd like to see everyone in July, but some visits may have to wait until August.  I'm on everyone's cancellation list, though. Anyway, I'm conflicted, confuzzled and occasionally terrified.  I suspect I'm not alone. Otherwise, I'm almost back to where I was before all of this revved up.  If anyone knows if that 5% Progesterone is of any benefit, please let me know.  Otherwise, I'm headed back to the studies.  (At least I'm familiar with most of the terminology). Good luck and God Bless each of you!  Gina",

I am 58, retired RN, grandmother of six and mom of three.  (That depends on who's in the house.  I've adopted many of my daughters' friends through the years and they still call me Mom). Yes, I'm shocky.  I found a lump on May 20, and I've been researching and chasing diagnoses ever since.  I have Invasive Ductal Carcinoma in my left breast, 3 cm at first mammogram and ultrasound.  Biopsies were done on both breasts Monday.  My right has atypical cells.  Despite having worked oncology and bone marrow transplant, (twenty years ago), when they called me with my results, I heard and comprehended maybe one word of five.  I know she said that I had a high nuclear mitotic rate.  Hormones are pending.  I'm having an MRI of my L Breast Mon, a CT chest Monday afternoon, (I have COPD), and I meet with the BS on Wed.  I'm going to Moffitt, which is an accredited cancer organization, participating in clinical research, trials, and professional education.   I've tried to get appointments set up as expeditiously as possible, but thank the Lord, I live with my middle daughter and her family.  She's helping me to keep up with appts and things. I'm blessed with a ton of support. I'm also so distracted by everything that my mind feels just blown.  I can't remember things for more than ten seconds straight!  I just sigh, review the lists I have, and start another one. I haven't cried. I suspect I'm looking at BMX, (hopefully with DEIP), chemo, radiation and maybe hormones.  We're still waiting on hormone receptor status. This site has been SO VERY helpful, and you all seem so warm and supportive. Thanks for listening.

I say treated as TN, because I have 5% progesterone that no one seems to know what to do with. I'll be getting hormone therapy and don't know about radiation yet But I'm Stage 2 Grade 3, and at one point, my PET scan showed minimal avidity, so we're expecting some lymph node involvement. It's fast and nasty, and I just want to be done with it. But, man, I want a cigarette!!! I can't do direct ti implant because I just finally quit smoking Oct 30. So my reconstruction will be sometime next spring. Definitely something to look forward to.  Gina",
