Instead of spreading out the treatments over 12 visits, they cram the same overall dose into four visits, so there is a greater likelihood of more side effects. Also, if you had no side effects from AC 1 and 2, there is no reason to \"expect\" side effects from treatments 3 and 4. I did not find the effects to be cumulative. Hair loss, on the other hand, was a huge deal for me.",

Komen, Cancer Care (free wigs and/or financial assistance). Just google all these resources for details. The cancer center at some hospitals have a \"wig bank\" that lends wigs. Also, maybe a bit too far away, but BCRC (the Breast Cancer Resource Center, which is part of the Princeton YWCA) has wigs to lend. Maybe a Y in your friend's area has this cancer resource too. Some do. Also you or your friend should try posting the request on the \"NJ/NY/CT/PA ladies\" thread here on Breast Cancer.org. Maybe someone from the Montvale area has other ideas about local resources. GoodWishesScarves.org offers a free head cover (scarf/wrap). HopeScarves does the same if you google them. Has your friend checked with her health insurance? Many insurance companies cover a wig if an oncologist writes a prescription for a \"hair prosthesis\" (I think that is the term they use, but it could be a slightly different term). Hope this will lead to something. Regards, Carol",

It is a colored mousse (in a spray can) that is temporary (as in it rinses out easily in the shower). It comes in a variety of shades. It can be bought at Sally's or online. It may be a temporary quick fix for you, and also a solution for others who are concerned about coloring their hair. I still use it on occasion when my \"sideburns\" are too grey and I am too lazy to do the whole head thing. Hope this helps.",

A few of the gals on there have had some success using a laser helmet. One of the gals who had success, advocated to get us a discount. Besides that, there is a money-back guarantee if one feels that there has been no hair growth after 6 months of use (though I'm not sure if that is also valid if one buys it with our discount...maybe it is). For a number of us who are barely 3 months in or less, it is too early to tell if it is working or not (though I think the texture of my hair has improved and maybe there is less fallout - both of which are early positive signs, prior to growth). You can see the product on https://www.irestorelaser.com/ It is a 25 minute treatment, every other day. You can message the company on their website or call and speak to them. You might also want to post any questions about this product on the Thinning Hair thread. ",

If you will be getting Neulasta to boost your white count, you go in the next day for this shot.  They suggest that you take claritin and tylenol for the next 5 days to avoid bone pain (esp in your sternum) but last time I waited to see what the side effect was.  I wouldn't even call it pain - just a strange discomfort, so I then did take the claritin/tylenol maybe once or twice. Being on a Tuesday chemo schedule, I found Thursday and Friday the days when the side effects kick in: mild-ish queeziness and big time fatigue last time.  Today, I have the mild queeziness but don't feel too fatigued yet.  Tried to avoid extra meds for nausea so have been using ginger tea, crystalized ginger, ginger ale, ginger chews (candy) and sea-band wrist bands that poke your acupressure points.  This all works to a degree and let me cut back on meds, though I finally gave in and took a zofran.  So:  bottom line, AC isn't too bad after all!  Good luck with your treatment! Chemo # 2 is when IT happens.  I wasn't even out the door of the infusion center when I had a fistfull of hair in my hand.  Boo hoo. ",
