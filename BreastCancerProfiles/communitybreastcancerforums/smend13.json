If anyone out there has ever had that happen - one is peanut size - the new one is pea size and then the node is not in the arm pit - more like where the bra strap is - the same with both lumps - right in line with the strap - please let me know - could it be just a cyst?? he said the mammo would have shown cyst or fibroid or any of those - I am freaking out and nervous - i hope it is nothing - Thanks!!    Does breast cancer spread like that? up - not always in the breast?  Log in to post a reply",
