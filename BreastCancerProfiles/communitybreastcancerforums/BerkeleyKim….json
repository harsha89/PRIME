I'm an intern teacher so I start back working full time in the class and taking classes again next week. I'm nervous and trying to gear up. Still tired from rads and all. Maybe with time I'll start to feel more confident...glad you're reaching that point and are going on with life full steam ahead!!",

Just figured how to check PMs. Pam and Eva--Just had a consult with my radiologist. I think if I didn't like her so much I might forgo it too. She told me that since I had lympovascular invasion and 1 of my 3 turmors is Grade 3, she'd strongly recommend radiation. Said that it will decrease chance of local recurrence from 30% to 10%. She won't do my armpit since 3 nodes were involved and they took so many that she feels there's no nodes to worry about. I'm worried about Lymphedema, which she said is a risk. It's a really hard decision. She said also since I'm young it would be worth it. I like that she said young (I'm 53, and feeling a wee bit older with the chemo). Anyhow, I think it's one of those really difficult decisions. I'm going to do some more research. Good luck! Misty and mimi--I had a left mastec. If my surgeon asks about reconstruction at my March visit, I'm going to ask about getting the right one off too I don't want reconstruction and don't miss my breast, just feel lopsided. I haven't been tested for the gene, but I think it's because I'm post-meno. Shocked--I know what you mean. The emotions would hit about 7-8 days after AC. I don't know what to do about the worry. I'm trying to switch it off and send it away, but doesn't always work. Chris--congrats on your first Taxol. I'm not supposed to get a neupogen shot, but was told that I might get body aches anyway. Not as bad as ice hockey---hmmm, and that seems like it could hurt pretty bad. Re swallowing problems--I had that also with AC. But after my onc gave me an rx for protonix my heartburn went away and no swallowing problems. He said I should continue to use it during Taxol for now. Weight?? I lost several pounds after the 1st 2 ACs. GAined a couple back after the last 2. Eating lots of nuts and eggs. I'm worried that I'll start to gain some back. I would like to lose about 10 more pounds to get back to pre-kid weight (and that was 22 years ago). TAKE CARE, jewels.",

I get unblinded on April 30. I'm not sure if I want to go on if I'm in arm C. Another 30 weeks of chemo? (at least it would only be every 3 weeks) I'm not having any of the SEs reported by others who have received the Avastin (there is a thread on \"Just Get me Through Treatment here). The Taxol has been so far much easier for me than AC. More energy, better appetite (mixed blessing, have gained 4 lbs already), and less heart palpitations. Went back to work 3 days/week after finishing AC and promptly caught a cold from the wealth of germs at the elementary school (or could have been from my dh 14yr old--we started sniffling last Sun). But, it didn't delay my tx and my WBCs have gone up since AC. Also, just started some Chinese Herbal remedy prescribed by my accupunturist/oncologist. For Qi and Blood Tonic--to help increase RBC. Hands are drier with Taxol, and am using LOTS of Burts Bees Almond handcream (kinda sticky but works for the red knuckles), and Burts Bees cuticle cream. Some of my nail beds darkened during AC, and I hope not to lose any nails....I think that would be worse than my hair. SO, good luck with your next step. Today is my steroid buzz day after tx--couldn't fall asleep til 3 am again last night, but I'm too tired to get up and do anything. Trying to do housework and some paperwork for school while I have the buzz on. Tomorrow is my down day--more emotional I think than physical, but hard to separate the two sometimes. I thought I'd be wearing scarves and hats to work, but my wig is fine and so far keeps me warm in the cold. It seems pretty ventilated, but we'll see when the weather warms. kim",

I've been reading a bit on the hormone thread here. SEs seem like chemo--some of us have them and other don't or not as much. I don't know if I'll start during or after radiation. Renrel--I had vit D checked when I was diagnosed. It was just 25. Then 1 month ago my onc tested again and it dropped to 20. I am taking D2, 1.25 mg softgel once/week for 9 weeks, then I'll have my blood tested again. I'm glad my onc is on top of this, as there is more and more research showing the importance of Vit D, and It's also important in helping us absorb the calcium we need for our bones (which take a beating during chemo and also if we take the anti-homonals). Ddlatt--HAIR HAIR HAIR. Since you mentioned your pink hair I've been looking for some with a magnifying glass. I have 1/16 (or shorter) stubbies---white (I'll call it blond for now). I had brown with some grey before. I'm so excited, but I guess I should knock on wood. My eyelashes and brows seem to continue to fall out (I'd rather keep them than the head hair). PrincessKauai--Sea Ranch--love that place! I'm glad you were able to go and do some healing. Holtbolt--I missed oprah-darn. He's been such a strong person for so long. Those nervous system degenerative diseases like Parkinson's and Huntington's are tough ones. Good luck to everyone considering stopping chemo. I think for node neg. it's just insurance, and if your body is saying stop you've probably had enough to do the trick. With my nodes involved I feel like I need to plug along no matter what because I know cells went beyond the tumor. I'm doing the weekly Taxol, and so far not too bad, although I can tell I'm getting  a bit more tired with each one. My accupuncture helped hugely yesterday My weeks seem to go fast with it. Treatment on Fridays, Good day on Sat with steroids, bad day on Sun with steroid crash and body aches, Monday start to feel better, work T, Wed Thur, and then tx on Friday again. I think I can do it but I AM READY TO BE DONE!!! (And it sounds like we're all really feeling that). Also, my blood counts have been going up slowly. Don't know why--Chinese herbs or all the beef . Thinking of you Jewels. Hoping you're having some nice spring weather. I have spring break next week, and so does dd from high school. Hope to get to the mountains, but not sure if the altitude would be good since I'm a bit short of breath sometimes.",

I love Napa, although I've only camped there. Vegas is cheap, but I'm wondering if there is some more relaxing place closer to east coasters/midwesterners. When I get a minute I'm going to research some options (that might not be for a few weeks!) I can do weekends pretty much after May but don't know how rads will affect me. I definitely commit to keeping in touch! I went to my first support group last Weds. It was ok but not as good as this thread! The women had a variety of different cancers, which was interesting.

Jess & Nancy-sounds like you're being great advocates for yourselves re the radiation. Hard decisions, and it sounds like you're both in the very low grey area if at all. My decision is a no-brainer--tumor size, vascular invasion. Although my rad onc doesn't want to do the axilla area or the supraclavcle area. One of my nodes was very involved--1.5 cm, but at least contained. I can relate to discussion of how to talk with drs. I feel like I have 5-10 min at most at tx time when I'm looped on benadryl. I try to make a list but feel intimidated. I am going to call the sec on  Monday to see if I can email my questions/concerns ahead of time. My onc is out of town, and he is very kind and thoughtful but very busy (yawns alot, disheveled professor look). I really feel like I want to vent at how long the whole process took initially--lump found 9-5, surgery not til 11-12, chemo 12-30. I think it's because they first only saw and felt a very small lump, and were of the mindset that there was nothing more and as they told me \"these things tend to grow slowly.\" I wish I could stop going back there.

For me there's be a REAL connection with you all, and that's something I'll value forever. And it's something that no one but us sisters can really understand. Catherine--yes, I'm SO READY to start the real healing. Right now I feel I huge lightness.  Since my dx way back in Sept, I've felt like I've been in a sort of limbo. Waiting for dx, waiting for MRI, waiting for surgery, waiting for chemo, waiting for se's...My life on hold in some ways. My hope is to live my best life, smell the roses, plan for the future, give back to my communities. I'm a worrier, and I know that I might need professional help dealing with my dark side--I'm going to take charge this time in fighting those demons (I usually just run from them). Even though there's still treatment ahead--rads every day, armidex (how many pills for how long???--I think Jilly counted it out!), blood tests--I feel that so much of the scary stuff is over. I feel grateful for so much. I've had minimal se's, and I was able to  maintain some of my former quality of life, which was a big goal and hope for me. I think I was just lucky through AC, and the weekly taxol was a comparative breeze. I've walked almost every day and have been able to eat (too much), and I went away for a beautiful weekend with DH, had some good fun with the kids when they've been home, taught part time (such a lifesaver for me), and been surrounded and lifted by the love of friends, co-workers, neighbors, family. Sundays were awful, and really I've never been so low emotionally as those days--but for now they're over (well, one more Sunday), and I think in a Buddhist sort of way, I now more really appreciate joy after this weekly experience of sorrow and pain. I've been confronted by sadness and true cr@p in my life before, but not predictably every week! I met some amazing survivors in chemo--woman and men, and each taught me something. It's funny how easy it is to develop quick bonds in the chemo room. OH!!! Good News. I met a woman today who was going in for a CT to see if she has a blood clot in her lung (probably not--they're just being careful. She said a 1/1,000 chance when on Tamox.), BUT  she finished chemo in Dec and Rads in Feb. She has CUT HER HAIR 3 times since! She wears it about 3 inches long! There's HOPE! Well, just realized what a LONG post this is. I wanted to count my blessings--and you Jewels are one of the best. Love and hugs.",

(The hormone stopper for sure...) One night was enough for me for mx. I'm glad they kept an eye on me, but there's no place like home. Same with childbirth--went right on home. Can't sleep in the hospital, even with meds. These days can't sleep at home either. Since my last chemo I've had pretty bad insomnia. Benadryl helps for a bit, then I wake at 4 and take Ativan, but sometimes that doesn't even work. I've been walking to relax, but I really need to figure this one out.",

I feel a bit lost not seeing him, and I have so many questions. He told me he doesn't do scans. Although I understand the logic of that it makes me nervous. He does check tumor markers every 3 months and does the other blood tests.  I think that the clinical trial I was on also has certain requirements. Guess I'll find out. Starting radiation Monday. I still have the bottle of Armidex sitting on my dresser unopened. Going to ask my rad onc about when she recommends starting. hope you jewels are enjoying your weekend.

Good to be able to talk about it and not let it build up to erupting volcano point. I seem to erupt more often than before, though. Could be the Arimidex on top of everything else. I was able to wear a regular bra and prosthesis through the first 3 weeks of rads. Then I switched to a bra I bought from Blue Canoe online, called the Jill. (Recommended on the rad thread here)It's very soft, but not much support for remaining boob but enough-maybe I should have bought a med rather than a large (and I'm not a small person). I put a cotton fiber filled form in the mx side. I've also worn Underarmor sleeveless, which gives some support by squishing real boob but doesn't rub. I wear it inside out so seams don't rub. Now that I'm not teaching I just go braless with a cotton shirt unless I need to go out. Good luck today with starting. Well, found out I get Ibandonate for the bisphos. trial. I am thinking I'll go with that as it is apparently as powerful as Zometa and is oral, so I can get my port out. I still need to talk with onc, but they are fed exing the drug so I start Monday.

Also didn't do a ct scan, but I sorta wish they did just to keep me from my obsessing about possibilities. Do you know what drug you get?. I'm still debating getting off and just doing Zometa. Going to talk with onc again about it. What an ordeal with the car! So many of you doing reconstruction. Hope it goes well!

KT- and Hawaii-I'm glad I'm on the trial--I want to do everything that might be useful to keep the beast away, especially with my positive nodes etc. You're right about getting a routine for taking the ibandronate. I'm hoping it won't be hard when I start back to school next week. My onc told me to start taking the Protonix again. I don't really have heartburn but feel like something's stuck in my throat, and he feels that it's probably from the ibandronate. We talked again about Zometa vs the others, and I feel better about going this route at this time, and he promised me that if he changes his mind in favor of Zometa he'd let me know. Renrel--cute hat, cute you! Plutz-glad you're daughter is close to home. That meant a lot to me last year, as she took the train home the day after my surgery to see me. My poor son had to worry from afar (or maybe he didn't!) Saw my bs, onc, and eye doc today (yeah, no cataracts from the steroids!). See the rad onc tomorrow and follow up on the port removal. My onc is so low key, which I guess is good, but very thoughtful. Blood work looked really good and counts are back within normal. Get the tumor marker and Vita D results next week. My previous CA15 was within normal range, but my vit D had decreased during chemo. Oh--and saw genetic counselor yesterday. She'll give me an order for the blood test next week. She wrote a book on breast cancer risk assessment, and gave me a copy (pretty old copyright of 2000), but she is very calm and reassuring and realistic. HUGS!!!! We're almost at 100 pages!!!",

I haven't really had bad swelling since surgery (wear my sleeve at work and during exercise like a good girl), but my arm started really hurting last week and I could barely straighten it.

It's getting a bit better since I stopped using the arm part of \"Elvis\" Phyllis--great news about the CT scan all clear. HOORAY!!  Sounds like our 15 yr olds are similar.

It was really hot for the jog part, and that was hard for me. I'm not a runner any more, especially with the pain I've been having in my ankles--anyone else??

We also visited Austria and Czech Republic, where my grandpa was from, and Germany, where my Grandma was from. Found their small villages, and saw so much else.

Just know we're here for you during those down times. I have to say that when I bake bread now I think of you!! Well, it's midnight, and steroid buzz time again. I know I shouldn't have napped but am so tired after tx. Oh well--my principal asked me for some testing reports, so I might as well do it now. Good night Jewels!",

No more nasty reactions, no more tx delays. You've been through so much. And I love your attitude! It's definitely time to stop and smell the roses, which to me smell better than ever. So, my long post was about how they tried to give me the placebo chemo after I already found out that I was getting placebo and not Avastin. Couldn't believe it. The research folks finally agreed it was my decision to not get sugar water or whaterever in my veins. My trial coord. was out of town, which is why she unblinded me before my last tx. I had a friend with me and we wanted to go to lunch---so of course I didn't want to sit an extra 45 min. for no good reason! My guest onc once again asked if I could ask to be in the group who gets Avastin. I told him before no. And I'm really fine that I didn't get it in many ways, based on current reports. Then he asked if I'm tolerating the Taxotere. I'm doing Taxol x12 thank you. Of course it's hard to step in for my onc's patients. My friend who was with me is a disability lawyer and was pretty amazed by the confusions of today--usually less drama in the tx room. Onc did say that if I'm exposed to anyone who has swine flu that I should call and get anti-virals before I show symptoms. No side effects. 2 more txs-2 more weeks! I've been thinking about how to celebrate. Think I'll keep it low key in the chemo room. Today sat with the 7th woman who has had recurrence. Who knows who they'll put me with last tx, and these woman are in to the end. I have learned so much from them, especially to listen to your own body and don't take no for an answer. I think I'll wait to celebrate til the next day---there's a school dist party for special ed interns where I can invite some of my students, and I think I'd be up for that; then my Louisiana friend is having her annual crayfish feed. Too soon after tx for some wine and whiskey soaked bread pudding?  i think not... So, I'm going to go back and read recent posts later. Hope all is well with my Jewels--thank you all so much for writing in and keeping me sane.",

I never was a huge drinker (at least for the last 25 years), due to family issues and I see what it can do to destroy lives. But I do enjoy my wine at night. I realize though that since I started my new teaching job in 07 that I had a glass almost each night. I think at the time research said that there were anti-cancer compounds in wine! I'm gonig to limit my wine but stil enjoy on special occasions. I will NOT resist the wine and breading pudding with whiskey sauce tomorrow at my friend's annual crayfish feed! But this time I'll moderate (especially cuz that Taxol will still be in my liver). I forgot to ask my onc today to clear that--too late! I've been taking milk thistle since my liver counts went over normal and now they're back to normal. Want to keep them there. Lisa--Yes! a marguerita sounds so cold and yummy now. I think we're in for a lovely hot weekend...I've been off soda since my husband's stroke last year. I used to crave Pepsi (not diet--never could stomach that), but no more. Armidex--my onc gave me an rx today and said I could start right away if I want (kinda vague). I hear there can be joint/bone ache ses, and I feel like maybe it wouldn't hurt to wait a week. But the AI's are the one thing I wish I could have started the day after dx! But, I'm also worried about completely depleting my body of estrogen. Anyone else start this?? Shocked--is it you who's on it? Rad sim coming up Monday, then verification on Tues. Asked onc about tomo, and he said it's not needed in my case, but he's going to confirm with my rad onc that she just wants to do chest wall, no axilla or other node areas. Pluses and minuses I guess to doing nodes.",

Thanks Jewels--I would not have thought to ask if you all hadn't mentioned it. Said I could have ovaries out if I had some other surgery going on, mostly to reduce cancer risk since I'm postmenopausal. If the genetic tests show a higher risk, then I'd get my ovaries out and the other boob off. He'll do another tumor marker test in August.

Went to my support group last night (of woman with different types of cancer). The running theme was \"hyper-vigilance\" of our bodies and how that sucks the joy out of so much. The woman who brought up the theme had Hodgkins Lymphoma in her early 20s, with chest radiation that led to breast cancer. She had a very early cancer over 2 years ago but still feels anxiety & fear. It really helped to talk about it, and hear the other woman's stories, and the common thread of \"waiting for the other shoe to drop.\" I'm trying hard to have faith that I'll survive this and continue to make plans for the long term, including finishing my master's coursework and teaching. I do find joy in that, but there's a lot of traveling I'd like to do and other stuff. I look at my tumor path report and freak out. How long do I have? How do I fit it all in? How do I lead what Oprah calls my best life? I forgot to call my social worker today to make an appt about my anxiety. Wow this is long--thanks for listening!

I already imagine that you ladies are in my living room, sipping wine, laughing, crying. Well, better off to bed. Have radiation early. 6 more days of regular treatment then 5 boosts.

Unfortunately the agency booked his girlfriend on a different flight leaving tonight. And he got diverted from jfk and missed connection to zurich. Drama. I'm signing up for the bisphosphonates trial because they told me my insurance doesn't cover Zometa since it's not approved for non-mets use. I'm going to push my onc more.

I've got to limit my time but I'm doing work projects on the computer and it's so easy. Well, I've been REALLY tired for the last 3 days. Just dragging out of bed. I think that it's a combo of the rads (they told me I might feel like I hit a wall about a week or two after finishing) and the arimidex. Maybe the ibandronate (boniva megadose). I'm taking an advil in the am, and seems to help with the achiness. But I feel so mentally sluggish, like I just don't have the same spirit (even less than during chemo). Coffee helps!!! (that green tea just doesn't perk me up the same). I'm flying to LA next Thurs to watch my mom, 89 yr old aunt visiting from Neb. and my sister's kids. My youngest will be flying down Monday and then we'll fly home together next Sun. We then rest a day and start a road trip to Seattle to see the pizza restaurant my husband invested in a couple years ago, visit friends in Ashland on the way, and then scope out the areas where the Twilight books took place. Last was in Seattle 9 yrs ago, so should be fun. I got the referral to have my port out finally but don't know if I can squeeze it in. Really want it out before school starts. For those who've had it out, how is the recovery?",

I walked her to the gate since she's 14. They asked me to take off my hat at security (have worn my wig before, and no one asked me to take that off!). I said OMG my hat??? My daughter said No big deal, mom. Made me feel ok, and I think I'm almost ready to ditch the hat. I have about an inch but very wispy white.

I REALLY needed that!!! (You're right Jess, very important to me to get out of town!) I had planned to take a \"mental health\" day that week but felt really energized and didn't. Kinders are so fun--made oreo turkeys and pine cone turkeys! So many different \"anniversaries\"--diagnoses, surgeries, and soon chemo. Today is the anniversary of my \"emergency surgery\" one week after my mast., when a blood vessel blew under my incision while having stiches removed. I truly throught I was going to die.  In fact, part of me didn't think I'd see another holiday season. I feel so grateful to be here, and I'm starting to finally accept the bad luck of getting breast cancer. I do think now that it is pretty much bad luck and nothing I did consciously but who knows what toxins I might have whiffed unknowingly or what gene mutation might have caused that first cell to start down the wrong path. Stupid cancer cells--don't they realize that reckless division can kill their host? And in regard to the new mammo guidelines, I wonder if the mammos could have caused mine. I'll never know. I do wish though that one of those many mammos had found my breast cancer. Still, I hope my daughters get their mammos young, with my history. Last Thanksgiving my kids made the dinner pretty much. Christmas we had my dh's family over, and I remember really trying hard to act like things were normal. Then chemo new year's eve!! I'm feeling ok one year from second surgery. Very stiff if I sit too long, but I hear that's a sign the Arimidex is working! Jilly--thinking of you. You WILL be fine, but the worry is so awful.

I still am not sure what I'll do. I'm so used to my fake one now. Hope your dh is ok. And to all Jewels--I'm so thankful to you all for being there for me over the last year!

We are waiting for the results of a couple polyps they found. I need to do this as well, but I think I'll wait til summer vacation. I'm back at work after spring break, which I spent waiting to see if I got jury duty (no!!) and studying for the RICA test, which I need to finish my credential. I'm taking 12 units at night, and just didn't have time to study and I just hope I passed--four hours of writing, and my Arimidex hand really cramped up. I've got SO MUCH homework, but I'll have my level 1 after this semester and have just a couple more classes for my masters.  It's good for me to keep busy, because I FREAKED out over break obsessing about recurrence. I got so low I wondered if I should have some anti-depressant, but now I'm back at work and no time to obsess. So, I need to make some plans for summer, which I'd like to enjoy. My mother-in-law died a couple weeks ago and we are having her service this Sat. I miss her. Just finished a book I know she'd love to read (Shanghai Girls--she was Chinese ancestry), but she's not here to pass it on to. She fell in her house on a Thurs. night and no one found her til Sun. She broke her shoulder and cracked her pelvis, and she seemed to be getting better in the hospital but then just couldn't improve. She was 88 and lived her life as she wanted--in her house on her own, with no \"life alert\" and wouldn't use the walker. She had a good life, and I'm happy we all got a chance to visit with her before she passed.  Well, homework calls...HUGS to all",

I figured at first why bother, but my onc wants me to do it. Started weekend with going into work on Fri (we had off!!!) and cleaning my desk finally and Ana's a bit. Then 2 hour walk in redwoods. Then Bridesmaid with dh--FUNNY!!! Yesterday I worked a bit, shopped with dd #2, and went to dh's family reunion dinner in sf. Today I'll clean and my bff are going to SF to have dinner and see Tales of the City musical at ACT. I LOVED that column back in the day and of course the tv show (ok--dating myself here!). Everyone enjoy the rest of the weekend! I hope to hike tomorrow, but dd #1 might be coming up from Stanford to use my Costco card. Can't believe she's graduating in 2 weeks. Oh--and trying to plan a vacation. Thinking Mexico, Isla Mujeres, but maybe Hawaii again.",

I 'm so nervous about lung and heart damage I almost feel like bailing out, although I know for me that would be crazy. Fingernail issues--weird vertical thin brown stripes that I thought were splinters until PrincessKauai told me the same thing happened to her! My thumb nails are hurting. but not discolored. I think it might be more neuropathy. I bought clear polish, as I heard that could help, but never used it. I don't paint my nails--last time my sister did it for me when I was in her wedding 14 years ago! My daughter said she'd do it for me, and has wanted me to for years. I just keep them short and scrub them when I get home from teaching to get rid of germs. I also use Burt Bees cuticle cream and almond honey hand cream since my hands are so dry. For those going on an Ai--how did you onc decide which to use. I've read through some of the Hormone tread here, and they all sound terrible. Was up til midnight consoling dd. I've got to get her a therapist. She can't get her homework done, although that's been an ongoing issue that has increased since my diagnosis, which happened the same time she started high school. I feel so sad. And today she went and paid for her own cartilage ear piercing, which I didn't think was a great idea. She's rewarding herself for doing well swimming, and I feel guilty for not paying for it. I'm really struggling with how negative she is about her looks--and she is so beautiful!!! (really--everyone says so!) and what girls do to feel good about themselves. Just saw the Dr Phil (ok--post tx veg out) where a 17 year old wanted to enhance her breasts!!! I just don't want my dd to get so caught up in that. Of course I guess I'm just an old hippy at heart.",

I'm worried about the higher dosage, with the potential for osteonecrosis of the jaw and kidney problems. Also, I'd probably have to keep my darn port. My onc is still recommending the trial because he's not convinced one bisphosphonate is any better than the other.

Glad you had fun on the coasters--making some lemonade for sure. I'm trying to get better at that. YearofHat-Sorry about your sister. I can relate. Brother went to 3-month rehab right before the 4th. Has been to shorter programs before. Wish I could help him, but couldn't even when I was feeling ok. If we juggle too many balls we're bound to drop one. AT this point we need to make sure we take care of ourselves, as hard as that is. I'm a basket case with worry about possible symtoms, bumps that I never noticed before, pains. I hate it. Just typing this makes me remember the counselor call is on my to-do list. My hair is starting to fill in. The ends are white and wispy but I think the roots are mostly dark now. Thick on back and sides. Need the top to fill in before I can actually call it a pixie cut. It's hot here, and since schools out and I'm working at home I don't wear my wig--just a sun hat when I go out. Still hoping I don't lose the lashes again....See an ENT on Thurs for the hearing loss the audiologist found and also the ringing in my ears. My PC said he wants to rule out an acoustic neroma. Great. Also picked up the Ibandronate for the trial yesterday. Still stewing re that vs. pushing my onc for Zometa. This is so typically me. I feel I can't think straight. As my trial coord said I can always drop out if my insurance covers the Zometa, and getting the port out sounds really good right now! Hugs to all jewels.",

I didn't buy any special wardrobe, but I did have a fleece jacket with big pockets and a robe with pockets. I put the drains in the pockets (I had 2 drains--don't know why? Maybe because they removed so many nodes). Also, I tied them onto my pj bottoms with the drawstrings for night. I wore camis during the day (those Costco ones with the shelf) and tucked the drains into the shelf. I didn't have my drain for long--less than a week after my first surgery. I did have my husband help me drain them. It seems like a 2-person job. I just couldn't do it right by myself. I don't remember what I wore home, but I do remember using the small pillow the hospital gave me to shield me from the seatbelt. Kathy and Phyllis--I''ve been considering removing the other breast, but here's an article that has given me comfort: http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=96035 about the chance of a new primary in the other breast. I'm still considering it, but need to get my genetic test done first. Also, I've read that any type of chest/breast surgery can affect the lymph system, and I'm already having enough trouble in my left arm (not big swelling, but enough discomfort to irritate me---I wear a sleeve to work, while exercising, and flying).  Saw the ENT today. I'm relieved he's pretty sure my hearing loss and tinnitus isn't due to a brain tumor!! Something about too much fluid in my cochleas. I didn't even realize I had a hearing loss before the audiogram, but the buzzing in my head sometimes makes me crazy. I'll see him again in 2 months. Gads...more appointments. 2 days of rads left!!!",

Visited friends in Ashland, my husband's pizza restaurant investment in Seattle, suspension bridges, shops, parks, gardens in BC, various Twilight locales on Olympic peninsula (if you have a teenage daughter--you probablly know those books!), saw whales, rainforests, giant redwoods.

I start taking classes again 8-25 and then teaching 8-31. I still need to meet my new principal and my co-teacher. I'm not ready! I'm finishing up some publishing company work that I should have finished months ago but cancer tx got in the way. My new principal asked for a head shot. Said that's a dilemma--wig or not. Told her I had cancer. She was VERY supportive, and said she's there to support my  health. Felt great. Also told me another teacher at the school had chemo and surgery last spring, so I won't be alone. Great to read all your posts. Lots of great news about treatments and life. I too am still feeling tired, especially after my vacation! Some numbness still in feet that comes and goes. Arm soreness still, which I think might never go away. Growing hair, though! Can't believe it's been almost a year since the first lump was found.",

Re genetic testing. Found out last week my insurance won't cover it because there's no one on my mom's side with bc. I don't think I want to pay the $3000 to do it. It's mainly for my dds. I need to call the genetic counselor back. Today is a big day! My youngest turns 15 and I feel so lucky to be making pizza for her and her gaggle of girlfriends who are spending the night. I always figured I'd be there for her forever, but now who knows. Today is also the day I had my ultrasound (a week after the lump finding), and 9-18 is the dreaded call day. Also today is 18 years since my dad died at 69 from prostate cancer (and why I want the genetic testing I guess). I remember my labor started and stopped with dd (never did that with the other 2), and my mom saying it would be great if she were born on the day my dad died. Once I heard that I went into full labor right away!!! And I really feel my dad was there in spirit, and she is so much like him.  My 19 yr old got her license!! Now she can pick up youngest dd until she leaves, which is too soon: 9-20!! I'll really miss her, not that I see her so much during the school year. But way in England is so far! Just found out that a mom of one of my students last year who has been fighting mets for 2 years is in hospital with perhaps days to live. I HATE this disease. Her boys are just 10 and 8.

Maybe some day she'll be able to reflect on this and accept life as a gift (which I try to get her to believe) but more often she thinks \"why bother,\" and I'm definately keeping an eye on her. Our getting sick hit her more than older relatives dying. I don't get that deep sick feeling in my stomach as often now that I'm 2.5 years out from diagnosis--but sometimes it does hit me that I could die of this at some point. More immediately, there was another drive-by at our school at 8:15 am, after I had just got to my classroom. Two cars shooting at each other. One car hit multiple parents' cars who were dropping off children, and no one was hit but the kids heard and saw it. Scary and I'm mad our students have to live with that.",

I see the chemo and radiation as there to wipe out any mutant cells that want to become cancer. Year of the Hat--I think that the shifting of priorities has been big with me too. I'm just getting the paperwork in to go back to work, and I wonder how bc will affect my work. I know that I have LOTS less tolerance for some of the stupid ads on tv and in the paper, especially anti-wrinkle stuff (which I have drawerfuls of) and minor health complaints! Well, I'm feeling lots better today (day 4 after AC #4), and my insurance told me that they are working on reinstating me after the cancellation request from my sch. district. DD is making carrot cake, so except for the hemmerhoids, life is good today. I'm going to go wash the chemo out of my sheets...that smell just lingers for me. Hugs to all--hope everyone is doing well today, and good luck with wigs, hair, nails, jobs, kids, SEs, etc.",

I'm on the Avastin/Placebo trial for high risk of recurrence. !The thread for that is under Just Get me through treatment. I'm going to try to push for the Zometa anyhow once I finish chemo because it shows promise.

Mammograms do catch MOST problems, but in women with dense breasts can be much less reliable (I've read diffierent stats--50-70%).

I don't want to change the focus of your work, which is so IMPORTANT, but I wonder if if this could be worked into the piece. One of my mammogram techs mentioned to me that they are beginning to recommend MRIs for women like me with \"busy breasts.\"  Anyhow, you are courageous and gifted. I hope to see the article soon! Re: Taxol--just had my first today (of 12). Since I'm doing weekly, I don't take steroid pills, just get some in the prechemo IV (decadron, kyril, benadryl). That takes an hour. Then, since this was my first, the drip the 1st 20 minutes VERY slowly to see about allergic reaction. Then they speed in up for another hour. It might take up to 3 hours if you are going every 2 or 3 weeks. I'm also doing avastin/placebo so that takes me an extra 1/2 hour. You did it--number 4 AC done!",

I need to talk with my onc. I think it's the steroids. My body hurts and I just want to cry and I feel hopeless. Now it's MOnday and much better. PrincessKauai--I definitely want to detox post chemo. I want to detox now!! I asked my onc about the weight gain. I thought it was water weight since I feel like I gained so fast (about 5 pounds in 4 weeks). He said no, it's the steroids that cause increased appetite and I need to be careful. He says he gets blamed a lot for chemo weight gain. Another reason for me to ask for decreased steroids. Let us know if you find a good detox. I think the \"alternate thread\" here might have some ideas. I'm really feeling chemo brain too--I'm making lists like crazy now that I'm back to work, but I feel like I'm spinning my wheels sometimes and not thinking logically.  It's scary since I too was a big multitasker. Ddlatt--thanks for the nail info. I just keep trying to keep them moisturized with the burt bees lemmon butter and almond butter. My hands are SO DRY. Some nails started to have dark verticle stripes during AC. Can't tell much difference after Taxol #4, but have 8 to go. Brenda--so good to hear from you. I'd been hoping you're ok. I hope you find the Taxol easier. My blood counts have started to go up (knock on wood). Even my red counts--but like Ddlatt I've been eating red meat again. But maybe you're getting the avastin and I'm not--since it's supposed to affect counts on top of the othe chemo. Did you get a follow-up echo or muga? My trial director is concerned mine went down so I have to have another one in April. I asked the onc and he's not worried but says the trial really wants to keep on top of the heart thing.

I wish I'd been trained on one of those fake boobs with lumps. My breasts  would change every month, though, and my tumors were \"hiding out\" in the dense breast tissue. But I think I've read that mammos pick up around 80% of bc's--but not ours damn it. My neighbor just accidently found a lump while showering and can't get an ultrasound appt for 2 weeks! I can't believe the waits we have to go through. Oh--and I catch myself feeling for lumps when my fake boob is on. Gads. Brenda--Hooray!! Just want you wanted-Arm B. I hope you start to feel better now that you're not getting it. I think Avastin can really affect the RBCs. 2 more!!! YearoftheHat--Congrats to your bf. I know it's so hard, a real life and death struggle, and I'm glad you both are winning, Have fun with your own celebration! Hope your friend can fix the chemo computer--you always make me laught. I did drive while bald after my hike the other day. Windows down, wind blowing through my stubble. Felt great. Going out to early mother's day lunch with dd and dh, but we do it every other week anyhow! HOpe I feel up to seeing dh's mom tomorrow and maybe my dd at college nearby. But I can't predict Sundays. Was still up to 4:30 am even without a nap. Darn. HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY to mommy Jewels. I'm counting my blessings for sure.",

I'm pretty tired right now from work and walking too much this week, but I'm really looking forward to starting to feeling better and going forward with rasds. Most of all, just one more downer Sunday to endure. And THANKS Jewel sisters for all your support and great posts, insights, laughs, sharing ups and downs. You all helped me pull through.

Holtbolt--keep me posted on the Armidex SEs. I hope you don't have any! I'm going to go buy some fresh glucosamine/chron....(sp) for joint pain. I'm already creaking. Jess--so you've decided on rads? I'm doing my sim on Monday and going to ask my onc again about radiation to the axilla, which she didn't recommend even with my 3 nodes. I want to be agressive but I also want to avoid Lymphedema, which so far isn't too bad. But my arm and full back feelings are constant reminders of the breast trauma. GOOD NEWS! My dh figured out how to make a fake swim boob from a poofy/scrubby shown on the Prosthesis thread here. Very perky!! Will fit in my Costco swimsuits, so no need to splurge on a mast. suit. I'm ready for our June trip to see my son graduate. We're staying at a great place on the bluffs overlooking Black's Beach in LaJolla, right across from the university. My last day with students is 6-11, clean up school 6-12, move daughter home from Stanford that evening, fly to san diego Sat, and my son's girlfriend graduates that afternoon. Son the next afternoon. Then our 23 wedding anniversary on 6-15, son's 22nd birthday 6-16, and I fly home with girls that afternoon in time for rads I hope. They give me one day off. I'm praying for some stamina and hair. My husband's staying to help them pack a U-Haul to move home. Full house again for awhile. I'm SO happy. My sister and family are staying at the same place, and we're trying to get my disabled mom down. I remember when her leg was amputated 4 years ago that she said she hoped to live to see Michael graduate! And she has!! 84 years old. Well, better go water the garden and get ready for some crayfish and whiskey soaked bread pudding!",

I was worried that they weren't radiating my axilla, since I had positve nodes, but they told me that they go by a ratio, and since they took and 3 were positive, that they felt they got it all and research shows it wouldn't make a difference to do the axilla. That made me feel better--the \"research shows....I told them I want to avoid Lymphemdema, but I'd much rather get all the cancer cells. I go back for verification on Friday. Haven't started the armidex. I did call my onc about starting date, but I guess I need to leave another message. Bev and Holtbolt--Eyebrows/lashes--STILL falling out!? So long after chemo? Mine are still falling out, but I'd hope to have more than a couple lashes by my son's graduation mid-June--I guess I can expect more to go. And I'm definitely brow pencil challenged, especially rushing to get to work with hands shaking! Gads. I'm not yet a week out from chemo, but I guess I felt that after a week everything would just quickly return to normal. My onc warned me probably not. Diane--I know what you mean about the groups. I am gong to my 3rd tomorrow, and I'm still not sure. The ladies seems nice, but have all different kinds of cancer. There's another one starting up for post-chemo breast cancer, and that might be better for me. Jess--good luck with the rads. Sounds like a good decision. Good luck with the TE and hope for no scarring. KM47--Congrats on the trip! How fun. I can't open the flip top ketchup bottle, among other things. KT57--Great news on the port--I'm so jealous! So they're able to do it during rads. That's one of the questions I called in to my onc. He prevously said I could get it out right away. Good for you with the bald/scarf look. I answered the door bald today, and a co-worker was bringing food. She is so sweet and said I look great. I still don't think I can do it at work...and it IS hot! And I haven't even started Armidex. Jilly--GREAT news! I'm hoping some of my aches go away as the Taxol wears off, but my sore shoulder is really bothering me. I've been referred to a physcial therapist. Hope it's from surgery or arthritis. Trying to keep my mind out of the dark places, but it's really hard. Plutz--June 12 is almost here! I'll be waiting too. Keep up posted on the grad festiviites!",

It's ok. I'm feeling stronger, and my legs are less weak. I still have some tingling in my toes, and the infernal humming in my head or ears. Getting that checked soon. Jess--I'm 3 weeks out from chemo, and I have frizzy white hair on top, with straighter white on the side and alittle dark mixed in. Not enough on top to go wigless. I hope I don't need to do comb overs. Lost my last eyelash on left eye, and 3 hanging on on left. It seems there are a few short eyelashes growing, but I need to use mascara to see them, as I think they are clear.  BevR-good luck with the port removal. Wish mine were gone!!! Lisa--I'm impressed by how proactive you are with all getting information, making plans etc. I'm going to ask about the ovaries at my onc follow up next week. I'm in menopause so although I'm not producing estrogen I'm still worried about ovarian cancer. Are any of you taking Ais during radiation. I still haven't started mine. I'm going to ask the rad onc tomorrow as my onc never did get back to me. Well, I can't remember the posts from the previous page, so I hope you are all doing well.

And I hope you have a restful week while the kids are away. The trampoline sounds fun! Ddlatt-thanks for the camera link. GAve me an idea for my son's belated grad gift!

And glad your daughter and family made it home safely. Will we ever stop worrying about our \"big\" kids!?? I think I've begun to worry a bit less since my diagnosis. Not that I don't care as much but I really realize that so much is not in my control, and I just have to hope for the best and expect the best. Plutz-I just had a single mast., but it was pretty pain-free. I spent one night in the hospital (no recon). I healed really quickly from the initial surgery. I think I may have overdone exercising my arm, and it is still after all this time sore and my shoulder is stiff, although my range of motion is good. I'm having PT for strengthening it. Good luck with your surgery! Do you know if you need to have any lymph nodes removed? YearoftheHat-Hope you can work out some kind of accommodation. And Renrel--Glad your returning to work is working out for you. I'm really nervous about starting my new job, and the expectations of people who don't know what I've been through. My last school was so supportive and I felt so embraced. But now that safety net isn't there. Yikes. Jess--I need to take that step of contacting my social worker to talk about my fears. I'm looking at scary statistics, and I'm really having a hard time with that. Keep us posted if you feel comfortable with that on how it goes. Like Catherine and KT (and you put so many of my thoughts into better words than I can!), I feel so lucky to have had the jewels with me through these months. Not lucky that any of us got this terrible disease, but for the support and companionship. I'm glad that we got through the chemo together, and that those of you who are done are still here for us who are still doing rads, looking at more surgeries, and taking hormone blockers (I'm starting week 3 of Arimidex and so far so good--I agree kmmd that sometimes we hear mostly from those with bothersome SEs on the Hormone thread, and I wish that no one has to have any SEs from drugs that can help us). .

I'm SO worried that won't be up to it, and I'm really hoping I can keep the stress level down and continue my exercising, which I've been able to do through the Taxol and radiation (not so much during the AC). I want to make sure I stay healthy and keep my immune system up to wipe out any rogue cancer cells (although I hope the chemo got them all!). Finished rads today.

I don't know how I'll do as I can't even seem to pick myself up off the floor after sitting. Even though I've been walking lots I still feel weak, and the body aches can get bad.

Ddlatt-Forgot to send congrats for the speaking gig! I'll be toasting us Jewels on New Year's eve. With all the time differences it might be hard to do online, since if we choose Eastern Time then it's 8 here in CA (right?) and I'll  toast from a friend's party.

Last night was a down, as I decided to clean up bags of \"cancer\" paperwork that I hadn't gone through since diagnosis. I found a brochure \"Undertanding your Pathology Report,\" and realized again that my report has so negative factors. I kept the report but managed to throw away 2 bags of paperwork, bills, prescription info--that felt good. I'm trying to cram in a lot in my short summer. Last weekend my husband and I went to Yosemite, one of our favorite places. Did an 8 mile hike, and realized I'm not in my 30s anymore! Went to Mendocino a couple weeks ago to visit friends and hike on the beach, and this weekend will drive to LA with son to pick up youngest and visit mom and sibs. Going to Kauai for 2 weeks in August, then back to school. I'm SO excited about going back to Hawaii--I really didn't think I'd every snorkel again when I was diagnosed, I was so depressed. I need to buy a new bathing suit, and I'm not too happy with the swim poofy I've been using. I'm worried about my arm swelling, but it's already survived some bug bites and warm weather, so I'm hoping it won't be a problem.NOW I'm really trying to lose some weight. My kids call me \"big momma\" and I don't like that. 20 pounds will get me to my weight when I was 30, and I'd be happy with 10 before the trip--but I'd have to go into starvation mode. ",

It's 600 meter swim, 11 mile bike, and 3 mile run (which would be a slow walk for me by that point).

She's so stressed by this--LADYJANE, I know what you mean. PAM: Re chemo bag. I brought a bunch of stuff but just ended up drinking water and tea and talking to the woman in the chair next to me and all the med. people who came in to see me. Oh, and I brought graham crackers. The nurse gave me juice, pudding, and a sandwich. They have a pillow and blankets, but I might bring a small pillow. I think I'll ice my tea this time. I'm going to invite a friend if my husband can't get off work. Maybe I'll borrow my daughter's CD player. Just reread the Avastin clinical trial agreement I'm in. Yikes. 12 weeks of Pacitaxol after the AC. I thought it was 8. What was I thinking???? Anyhow, here's to a good week, whatever it brings you! kim",

I've mainly been drinking water and decaf tea, but  just looked at my chemo instructions, which say we should be drinking at least 10 cups per day to help remove the chemo by-products, following the 1/4 rule: 25% soups for sodium (miso, broth, chicken rice, etc); 25% water; 25% Popsicle, sherbet, jello, soda, pedialyte, watermelon for calories fluid; and 25 % milk and juice for potassium (apricot/peach nectars, apple juice, grape juice). Here's a homemade sports drink recipe they gave me: 1 Qt kookaid (yuck),+1/4 tsp salk + 1/4 tsp salt substitute + few drops lemon juice. I think I'll just buy the Pedialyte. My blood counts are up-better than before I started chemo!The dr. today said that it just took much longer than usual for the Neulasta to work (and glad it did cuz I felt crummy the day after the shot,so it was worth someting). Didn't think I'd look forward to getting chemo...but I didn't want it delayed. My dr is out, and this one wouldn't write me a return to work note, so I still have to wait. Got a referral to the LE clinic. I'm worried my post-surgery swelling still hasn't gone away. Marymoir--haven't made the scarfs. Gotta do it soon! Today is day 13, and it should start falling out any minute. I better go get a shower cap for bedtime shedding... Good luck to everyone doing tx and recovering from tx. Kim",

As part of the trial we get Taxol every week, which should be easier. My WBC started out low: just 4.6, so I hope the Neulasta shot tomorrow helps boost it up.

Onc says not to worry...  Double-checked today that they said my PET was fine. Finally some good news.  I'm 52, with 3 kids--2 in college and 1 home (14 years, and my rock), and a very supportive DH. Changed careers from 20 years in publishing last year and have been teaching and going back to school. Really want to go back to work, but not sure if I'll have energy to teach 1st, 2nd, 3rd graders. Doc. says I should see how I feel after 1st tx, although just heard insurance won't cover Emend anti-nausea!  Anyhow, these boards are great for info. and support. We are all going to beat this! Just talked to a friend today whose mom is 75 & had mast. and 5 + nodes over 20 years ago--great story. Lisa--what is the chemo list for GNC, and throat coat? Ddlatt--how did you get your onc. to give you Zometa? I asked today, and I don't think he'll go for it. Maybe I'll check out UCSF after initial treatment. Good luck all! We'll sure remember this New Year down the road... Kim",

Your treatment will be much shorter than mine (16 weeks chem, then rad if I decide to go through with that), so that's great!  Good luck. Hawaii808, it's hard to stay positive all the time. A friend of mine who's a nurse said that it's actually too stressful to do so, and we should all give ourselves permission to feel crappy and sad sometimes, and that tears release stress (and for me though it's sometimes hard to pull myself out of that and not show too much to my children).

The muga scan was  hard for me at first, but they let me keep my arms at my side since I couldn't lift my left arm at all 2 weeks after surgery (and am still having a hard time). I could hear my heart beat, which was nice and slow til I thought about it, then it went wild and I had to have them stop (and I needed to scratch my nose and was pinned down under the heavy rad-proof blanket). But, once they turned off the heartbeat I was fine and finished the test. Then I had an echocardio gram cuz the muga was low normal, and the echo was fine. The onc said I could just do echo for follow ups. I had to lie still longer for the PET/CT, but that went really well (no heartbeat to listen to).  I have a 14 yr. old who has been my rock, and although she's worried, she seems able to calm ME down. It's hard, though, because mentally I'm just not as there for her as I had been for my 19 and 21 yr olds (who are home for the holidays--yeah!). I haven't been sleeping well either, although I seem to hide in bed a lot. Tried melatonin, but Lorazepam really helps me sleep deep for 6 hours. Before this b/c I thought of myself as pretty calm, but I've been so high anxiety--can't be good...people keep reminding me to breathe deep, which helps.",

Hawaii808 and Year of the Hat- (and anyone else starting weekly taxols after AC) Well, my onc, the nutritionist, my accupunturist, a friend and the nurses all send the 12 weekly Taxols are easier. To avoid neuropathy common with Taxol, the nutritionist told me to get L. Glutamine powder, 10grams(about 2 tsp) mixed in water or juice. Swish in mouth and swallow 3 times a day on empty stomach before meals. Also tax 600 mg. a day Alpha Lipoic Acid with food. And my accunpuncturist highly recommends continuing weekly treament through taxol for neuropathy before it begins. Too late afterward. I'm being positive and submitting my back to work papers. GryffinSong--I hate taking too many pills, and help off from my antinauseas last treatment. Didn't vomit but had much worse heartburn. Good luck with next AC. Do you follow with Taxol? Ninja-Welcome to the group (but sorry you have to be here, of course). Good luck with the last AC. I had to block the view of the push syringe this time. I was really queasy just being in the chair, and took an Ativan. I feel ok today after my last AC. Usually I start to tucker out from day 2-5, then start to slowly rebound. Hope it's true this time.

Pamela: I had L mast 11-12, and I  called my bs today because I'm still feeling numbness and fullness, which seemed to increase the last couple of days, especially around back toward my scapula.  Now I feel a bit better. He said that he healing process can be slow. I'm going to get a referral to a PT/lymphedema expert to make sure I'm doing what I should be. My range of motion has really improved, and I can almost lift my arm over my head (with lots of joint creaking). I feel if this arm thing would go away I could handle everything a lot better, including the hair loss which should start soon. Just had some phantom itching and I couldn't scratch it!!! Kim--Thanks for the advice. I'm calling my union tomorrow. So far I've been really supported, and my co-teachers have been my angels--bringing food and groceries. Year of the hat: There are a few of us in this Jan club who've been through the first chemo, and I think we were all pretty nervous, but it seems like we all weathered it really well. My first AC went fine. I felt a little nausea that night and for a couple of days, but I could eat and drink and didn't vomit. More energy today, but I wish my mood would improve... I'm having hair cut short tomorrow. Sh...Went to Looking Good, Feeling Better, which was nice for the free make up, which I need to learn how to use. Got another free wig. They showed us how to make a turban out of a t-shirt. I hope I'll be able to do it myself. Looked kinda nice. Got a papercut while there on my bad arm and ran right to the bathroom to wash it--and today is day 7 when I guess my wbc count is lowest. So far so good. Hugs and good wishes to all. Kim",

Neupogen is the same stuff, but on a small molecule and is not so long lasting, and that's why you need to get one every day. I just want something that works!   Glad you're feeling better, Hawaii Pam!

JillyG-Hope you can get on with treatment too. So discouraging when so near the end, but it will end!! Ddlatt-I hear you on the Taxol is easier (so far at least, but I'm going to seize the day while it lasts).

I remember hearing about issues with the woman wearing bhurkas. Gads, and they KNOW you! SweetPam-You made me laugh too! I think I should wear my heart on my sleeve more of the time. I had to bury some emotions at work this week, and I wonder if that is good for my health. I'd rather be healthy sometimes than have a job. I 'm trying to learn how to cope with what I can't change in a positive way, and I need to acknowledge that means I can't say everything I think but that I do need to deal with it so it doesn't fester inside and cause me stress. Renrel-What a great tx center you have! Lunch, meditation garden, resource room...I just want to scram out of mine asap (although I do like the nurses). PrincessKauai-I guess we'll probably have some hair by the next HOW BERKELEY CAN YOU BE parade, but I'll definitely be donning the bright red long ones my kids wore to BHS spirit day. One more tx--GREAT! And I drive by the memorial to the little boy every day to and from work--and tear up each time. So so sad. He was a beautiful child. Mimi--Chemo--the gift that keeps on giving I guess. Hope the transfusions help you feel better fast. Had no. 3 Taxol today and it went fine. Have had a cold for 3 days (nose to throat to chest) and thought they wouldn't treat me, but my WBC actually went up so they did. I'm going to lay low and get better and get my voice back.

My thoughts are with you as you fight this and take care of your son. Maybe ask your dr. about the Neupogen shots instead. The Neulasta didn't work for me until later, so they gave me 3 shots, one each day starting on day 7 of Neupogen. It's a hassle to go in, but I didn't get the pain I had with Nuelasta.

I'm wiped out, and feel guilty for missing my 3 classes of students doing Hispanic culture month performances. Just can't do it. Plus.

I've come to expect it, but I really hate feeling so sad. I might try coffee and advil this time. I haven't had the gene test. I'm going to ask. I feel like there's been a lot of cancer in my family (dad, brother, grandmother, uncle), but I don't know if that would be the same gene you all are having tested. My surgeon didn't seem to think I should have it as I was post-menopausal but it sounds like I could still have it. I'm worried sick for my DDs. I'm so happy my kids are home from college. Having all 3 acting like kids, laughing, fighting makes me treasure each moment and feel so grateful for so many joys. My son (21) told me he just can't believe still I have breast cancer and he doesn't want me to die. His girlfriend's mom has Huntington's disease (definitely fatal by around age 50), and my older DD (19)'s boyfriend's mom has met. bc. They just feel it's so unfair, but I told them I'm definitely feeling great and fighting this disease, and they can expect me to be around a long time (they are also so worried cuz their dad had a stroke last year, which he has mostly recovered from).

I had some good cries earlier in the diagnosis, but now I'm more just worried. When I saw my primary care doc prior to this, I told him how hard it was for me, and he suggested getting some happy pills during chemo if needed. I think for now, I'll keep trying Peter Pan's words: Think of the happiest things...Also, looking at my kids' baby pictures helps. Lisa--1/2 way--congrats!!! Sounds like you're handling this great. Year of the Hat--they gave me a double dose of Ativan before my last tx because even though I've never gotten sick during tx, I was ready to throw up this last time just being in the chair! It helped I think. Dance!",

Guess not. I always felt that I was really healthy and had great control of my diet. This disease makes me realize what little control I have. My nurse today said that it's just what the drugs do to us. I'm taking mushroom supplements, accupuncture, eating as well as I can, and still the counts tank out.  I had good counts after tx2 and thought I would again. So get Neupogen again tomorrow and Sat, and maybe Monday if counts are still low.  Came home, kicked back, and read most of This Boy's Life (saw the movie, and my daughter took a class with Tobias Wolff), so can't complain.",

I had asked my onc about it, and he seemed less than enthusiastic a few months ago, but I'll ask again. I know someone with Zometa-induced jaw necrosis (bone cancer mets), and it's been horrible The necrosis got infected and after lots of antibiotics he's able to eat. But he's in his late 70s.

Can you insist on the Neupogen or Neulasta shots? Willl insurance pay? With AC I got the Neulasta after the 1st tx, but it didn't kick in soon enough. I then got  3 or 4 Neupogen shots in a row, starting on day 7 after tx. Although it was a bit inconvenient to go in (but hospital is just 10 min from my house, so not bad and open Sat and Sun), I really didn't have a reaction like I did with Neulasta. A bit of body aches, but really didn't stop me. Good luck. I can't remember how many more txs you have, but it's worth it if you can get the shot to keep those counts up. Re WBC. Mine were going up on their own with the weekly Taxol x12. Today they dropped from 3.5 to 2.5,and Neutrophils went to 1700. I felt really good this week too so I don't know what happened. Was tired and sneezy yesterday, so maybe that's it. Re: Tamox vs. Aromatase(sp?) inhibitors. I asked my onc and he said that post-menopausal usually start with the AL inhibitors. Studies show it is slightly more effective and less dangerous (no uterine cancer side effects), but there are other side effects that might occur (fatigue, sore joints). He said that they are usually given for 5 years, but that studies are now being done to see if more than 5 years is ok. So, there's a study that will apply directly to our treatment. I will start right after chemo during rads. He cleared me to go to mountains, but discouraged skiing. He said with my lower RDC and hemoglobin I will get winded and higher heart rate at higher elevations, especially if I don't go for more than 3 days to acclimate. I think I'll just look at the view, then. Got a good night's sleep without DH coughing in my face. Feel a world of difference. PLUS, premeds cut in half--no allergic reaction. HOORAY!! I feel so much better with less benadryl (50 cut to 25) and the pharmacist says that cutting steroids from 20 to 10 is fine and people go as low as 4. The nutritionist said cutting it will help decrease my appetite. So today, all is good and I think I'll even get over the benadryl haze in time to drive to DD's swim meet at the local high school. I can't wait to start swimming myself. Will wear a cap as I don't want chlorine to mess with my newly growing peach fuzz dome. HALF DONE with Taxol. Another Hooray",

But that's a question you might want to ask--how much time between chemo and rads and how they feel about breaks if you have something scheduled. Also,  how many sessions, and I forgot to ask about \"boosts,\" which I've read about here. At this point I'm getting around 6 weeks to the chest area only. I'm still a bit anxious that she doesn't want to do the under arm area, but she felt that the surgeon did a good job of getting all the affected nodes. So you might want to ask what areas they plan to zap and why. Also, she told me that local recurrence is reduced from 30% to 10% in my case, but overall survival isn't affected. I want to ask about that. Doesn't make intuitive sense to me. I asked about swimming, and she said fine but keep an eye on the skin and keep it covered up from the sun. She also recommended getting aloe from Trader Joes. I want to find some loose cotton clothes and camis--looks like peasant blouses are back in style! Good luck! Let us know what you find out. kim",

I use biotene, and my teeth aren't really turning more yellow then before, but I was a big coffee drinker pre-cancer...I have noticed that a tooth next to my cap in the front is turning a bit dark, and I'm worried about that but maybe it's the chemo. Renrel-great idea about the exchange. I'd go to one. I bought several hats, which I might wear when I go back to work instead of the wig, but I don't know. I really need light ones for when the weather warms. And you're such a baker!! Do you use dried chick peas or fresh? I love to bake bread and turned out a few loaves a couple weeks ago at my dd's request. Felt so good to be kneading again. Holtbolt--thanks for the link. That's a good deal!",

Have blood count test tomorrow and Neupogen shot. For protein shakes, I've just been adding a scoop of whey protein to my yogurt smoothies, and also eating almonds that I've baked (been told not to eat raw nuts). Whey protein is supposed to help immune system too. Pumpkins seeds are supposed to be good--not sure if they're for protein. I'm eating eggs again. I guess I'll worry about cholesterol later. Am getting pimples on my 53-yr. old face (from AC?), plus my skin is dry. Head hair almost gone, but leg hair still there. Holding onto eyebrows for now. Have NO sense of humor today. Gotta take it a day at a time, and remember yesterday was good for me and holding hope for tomorrow (and the next frigging 3.5 months of chemo and a few weeks of rads).

I cry when I think about our good friend who was hit by a MUNI train in SF on Sun. His wife works for my  husband and co-ordinated all the support to our family from his co-workers after our house fire and his stroke. He is in critical care--but when my husband called his wife last night she asked how I was. I'm really feeling the blessings and curses of being human. Well, I've got to do some of the editing work I've continued on the side--still dragging my feet about going back to teaching. The med. people have scared me about getting sick, and I just can't see how I can predict how I'll feel. I admire all you teachers getting back.

So far I think the premeds have been harder than the Taxol, but it's hard to tell. I felt so much better after stopping AC, and I have more energy to walk and get other chores done plus work (which I didn't do during AC), and my blood counts are better with no Neupogen so far. After a couple tx of Taxol I realized that coming down off the steroids was very depressing for me (Sunday after Fri. tx). I'm hoping tomorrow will be better. After reducing steroid dosage to 10 last week, Sun was better but tiredness and aches dragged on to Monday. My onc said that I will probably start feeling more tired as txs go on. My hair on head is starting to grow back, but eyelashes/brows still falling out. Also I have some lower back pain, and am just hoping the Taxol is working. Weekly is ok for me. I have tx fri and take Mon off work. By thurs afternoon I'm actually ready to kick back at tx and sleep. There's a link to research on the 12 Taxol vs. other options on this  website under treatments. I hope this works out for you. Oh, and chemo brain definitely kicking in. I had a hard time packing for our little 2-day get away.. Not like me to not be able to multitask.

Both red and white counts improved during the 1st 5 tx of Taxol, then went down (but still within tx range) for #6, then back up for #7. So, so far Taxol's been less hard on my counts than AC. I felt pretty good today and went for a long walk with 14 yr old DD. Usually today is my bad day. My onc said that he felt my counts would improve on thier own without Nuepogen, and so far they have. He would consider the shots if needed. Good luck with your next step. The weekly is inconvenient, but I've got a routine/schedule and it seems to be ok for now. Well, busy day of cooking, walking, chatting with my kids away from home and friends, financial aid apps for DD. Reduced emotional crash thanks to reduced steroids. Hope tomorrow is ok too. Will have another echocardiogram early tomorrow am since my heart function decreased on the last one, and then try to mail off taxes.  Good luck to all doing chemo this week!

My nutritionist recommended milk thistle and lots of artichoke (also in thistle family), and wheat grass. My eyelashes are still falling out as hair is growing in. My onc wants to start the AL while I'm on rads. I'm postmeno. He says AL has been shown to be slightly more effective than tamox at prevent recurrence. There are studies I've googled. However, I want to take a suppressant as long as possible, and I think I mentioned there are studies being done to see how long  we can take ALs. I'm going to ask if I can do tamox after AL. Maybe I'll just have my uterus out... I think the SEs affect some and not others--from what I've read on the hormone thread. I don't get what the difference is in ALs (Femera, Armidex, etc. I'm worried about weight gain and joint pain the most. Feeling better about my remaining breast. Will wait to make a decision after I'll off this tx roller coaster.",

I'm too emotional now.  Good luck finding a surgeon you like and with your decision. Jilly--Sounds like a plan! Do you think the recovery time will be the same for the second breast. I'm thinking less because they don't have to do the node sampling./dissection. Hope everyone had a good weekend. As usual, I was in my fog with some body aches on Sunday.

Sorry about the trial--I'm hoping that with my below normal bone scan my onc will be willing to just prescribe zometa (still need a dental exam, but need to cross the chemo finish line first!) Sounds like so many Jewels are going through post-chemo blues and worries. Gad--I'm there and am not even post-chemo yet. have a GREAT TRIP!!! (Hope you found some worthy flip flops) Jess--Thanks for your post. I've been thinking the same--I'm still obsessing about what I went through with diagnosis. I know I've increased awareness among my friends who are demanding ultrasounds and clinical exams with their mammos or ultrasounds. I do believe that fear of finding cancer was a barrier for me in doing GOOD breast exams consistently (sure, I felt around, and have to comfort myself that the professionals couldn't feel it at first til the MRI was done). There is a lot of education out there, but I think sometimes it's conflictual. One of my friends told me her OB gyn said don't bother doing self-exams--we find so many lumps that come and go. And a nurse friend of mine told me the same. And I think women fear what the mammos will find. How to get over that??? I think going with a buddy to mammo, or maybe even insurance mandating mammos for coverage? FOr women without insurance, then maybe some reward for going--coupons. In sf they just got funding for a digital mammo-bile (similar in concept to book mobile or blood bank mobile). This is such a public health issue in so many ways. Not contagious, but just as many women die each year of bc as yearly flu deaths. I do want to get involved more once I finish all my treatment. There's a nonprofit nearby for low-income women with cancer (not just breast), and also a Women's Cancer Resource Center that I at least want to donate to if I don't have time to get involved. Thanks for your thoughts. Keep me posted on your thoughts and plans. It's empowering to think about what can be done to help others. So, steroid high again. Well I may be an old hippy at heart, but definitely not in practice! I realized this when I left the house to go for a walk this eve and forgot my hat! I had to go back to get one. I felt like I feel when I forget my bike helmet--vulnerable and naked. But in this case I also just didn't want anyone to see me!! I have not embraced the bald, as so many have here and on the thread by that name. Also I didn't want to get mosquito bites.

Plus now I have a big red square outlined on my chest that they don't want me to wash off. But, the good news is that I can swim during rads as long as I just rinse off well and pat myself dry. I didn't want to spend a summer without swimming. She did recommend one of those \"rash guards\" (swim shirts) since I can't expose my chest to the sun. Renrel--great story about the shirt.

Kathy--You sound like you're dealing well with the new genetic testing info. A lesson to me who has now been recommended to get it post tx as well. Like you they didn't recommend it originally due to my age (then 52). I was wondering about what you had mentioned before about needing the info for your sons. Will the mutuation affect their health or do they pass it on to girls? Plutz--I'll be sending good wishes this Friday. They'll probably send you home before the weekend is over. Remember a little soft pillow to protect you from the seatbelt on the way home. I used one for a couple weeks after my mx. Kmmd--  Cr@p about the lashes.

Glad you had a good time. The hot flashes for me with the arimidex can be amazing! Even during the day now. My onc last week said he could prescribe Efflexor, which is also an antidepressent.

So far I've just had some bone/muscle aches off and on (but onc says could be the arimidex) and some indigestion. He said to go back on the Protonix. Renrel-Good luck with the increased hours. I know what you mean about the difficulties in quieting the mind once we get back to our busy lives again. I'm going to try to set some time aside to sit and reflect. As far as worry--I'm a basket case, but my genetic counseling gave me some really good advice. She said that the result of worry is like a little trench the rain makes in our brain, and that the worry is the rain that makes it get bigger and bigger and more destructive. It takes a conscious effort to acknowledge that it is worry and then say go away and fill the trench in will gravel (positive thoughts, for example). I liked that analogy. Also, my rad onc yesterday said that in five years I'll wish I hadn't worried so much! I guess I still haven't accepted that my diagnosis changed so much in just a few weeks almost one year from now (Sept. 18 official phone call day). I was early stage one and then wham, 3 nodes and 3 tumors! Letting the scary percentages go is what's hard for me, and I think that coming to terms with my place in this universe is really key. kmmd--Had to have my eyes checked last week cuz the coating is disintegrating on my glasses and I can't see very well. Surprisingly my vision didn't change!! I guess it was just the coating!! Also I mentioned that no cataracts, which can result from steroids. Holtbolt-I know what you mean about the second guessing. I'm just getting the genetic blood test and I'm thinking, Why now! (for my kids, more than anything I guess). I hadn't heard that endometriosis is linked to bc, but gald she fixed it.

Glad you're celebrating that and the end of rads. I still don 't feel back to 100%. On Sat morn I am SO TIRED and achy. I go back to that DREADED building Monday for another 2 month follow up. I see a substitute onc and I need to ask about being so tired and achy. I have another 2 month in Dec., then on to 3 months. This is following the bisphosphonate trial protocol I guess. Lovely fall weekend here. Hiked around a local lake with my son. So glad he's home, although I think he is less so. Although he's happy that we're all going to see Bob Dylan!!!! tomorrow at the Cal Greek Theatre. I'm so excited--haven't seen him in 35 years (wow--dating myself). DS took a philosophy class on Bob Dylan at UCSD, and wer're taking his girlfriend and my dd too.",

(Where is mine...? Buried under piles and piles of stuff.) When we were being treated we were being fixed. I'm trying to convice myself that I've been fixed and that the arimidex and the bisphosphonate trial drug I'm on will help keep me that way, but of course there's that dark, doubting place. I think I'm less in denial now than during treatment about the possibility of recurrence and my risk. That's hard. It's something I need to figure out how to live with. Some days are better than others. The death of the parent of my student really hit hard, I'm realizing.  I lost it last weekend because I wanted to go out of town to relax at Tahoe but no one else did--although they were \"willing.\"  I felt panicked thinking I might not be able to see the mountains again in fall. My husband said well I guess you just need to do everything right now. Right. I realized that I will need to do things with other friends if I want to do them. Kinda sad...  I'm going camping with a bunch of teacher friends in Big Basin Redwood park this weekend. Decided to invite my husband too, and I guess he's more than \"willing\" to go--even got some equipment out. Just decided to get a tent cabin rather than a tent. So, I'm trying to live the life I used to live but make sure I get some fun in too! Great to have a mid-week day off. Thought about my dad--the WWII vet, whom I miss terribly still.",

You sound like one busy lady between the grandbaby and work! I am on Arimidex and hear that trigger finger is common. My hands sometimes hurt, and I feel like after 6 months I'm having more and different aches and pains. Good luck with your new AI. My onc told me that if you have any prior injury or arthritis the AIs tend to make it worse. I've been taking Glucosamine/Chronodate (spell??), and I'm able to move around most of the time ok.

Also, there are days (usually weekends of course) when I just feel like I want to stay in bed I'm so achy. Have also been taking some Advil. Also, I'm on the Boniva too and it's so hard to know what drug is causing what symptom. Please keep me posted about how you feel. kt-so great that you raised so much money for the ACS, and I'm sure your co-worker is smiling down on you! Well, we now have an elliptical machine that takes up a good part of my dining room. My dear son went to get it off Craig's list. I love to walk outside but the weather has been rainy off and on so now I have no excuse. But I'm having such as HARD time losing weight. I'm really trying but it seems to go up! I pigged out through the holidays and now I'm paying. I'd hope to have lost weight before my next onc appt, but it's in just 3 weeks. I'd love to go off the Arimidex to see if that might help. I'm definately using it as an excuse. p.s. I love to see everyone's hair. I like mine but it needs a trim.",

My son turns 24 on 6-16, and I remember trying to eat the wonderful wedding cake we saved and it just didn't taste right. I was in labor but didn't realize it--just had stabbing back pains. Everyone else loved it!! Anyhow, for years our anniversary consisted of getting ready for DS's birthday. I think we need to do something special this year!!  My daughter is graduating college on 6-12, so we might be busy getting her moved back home, and I'm finishing up the semester. We'll see! I'm just SO HAPPY to be planning my daughter's college graduation!! I really wasnt' sure I'd be here for it. Now I don't want to tempt bad luck, but I'm pretty sure I'll be there!!! On a very sad note...my co-teacher called me yesterday  to tell me she has ovarian cancer. Found out while visiting family out of state for spring break. Sister wouldn't let her go home until they found out why her abdomen continued to grow and her pain. I can't believe it. I'm in shock like I was when I was diagnosed. She is staying with her family and hopes to have surgery there but has Kaiser here--I can't believe they kept telling her her symptoms were due to \"flu side effects\" and last fall to indigestion. I hope it's just a bad dream I'll wake up from. She's just 40 and it's so unfair--I hope maybe the CT scann was wrong and it's just cysts but an onc read the films.  Please send prayers or good thoughts to Ana.",

I get notified through My Favorite Topics when there are new posts, but I don't log in. I do keep check BC.Org regularly as a habit I can't break! Around this time almost 8 years ago I was a few weeks into radiation and about to begin Arimidex. I'm still taking Arimidex, and want to as long as my bones hold up. My onc says ok but there is no research to support extended use. I feel like it's my little magic pill for now. I just saw my youngest graduate from UC Santa Cruz (she donated a kidney to my husband last Dec.), my middle daughter will begin her second year of law school at Cal, and my oldest is a high school teacher and has a month-old son-who I will be babysitting next school year. I decided to retire, babysit, and smell the roses after teaching Kinder special ed. (although my retirement income will only partially cover my health insurance, but I think it will be worth it). I'm so grateful to have seen my babies through these milestones. Annual mammo this Monday and annual onc visit next month. Still have anxiety! Love to you all.",

I had 4 AC followed by Taxol x 12 (equals 5 months of chemo), and was able to work part time teaching through my Taxol. Drink LOTS of water, and take those anti-nausea meds if needed while on AC. Also, I lost weight during AC but gained it back plus some while on Taxol--a big regret now. Those steroids made me hungry! Just a heads up... LovingLifeToday--saw your post. There's a January Jewel (our name for ourselves!)--ddlat, who does photography, and recently has used her images to encourage early detection. She might have some ideas for you too. Good luck!",
