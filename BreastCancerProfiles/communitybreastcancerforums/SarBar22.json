I couldn't think of anything else for 10 days...and of course I wasn't super busy at work or at home, so this occupied all of my brain power. And then when it came back benign I was just exhausted, obviously happy, but drained. Surgery to remove it is in 3 weeks, and then hopefully this whole thing will be over! But, like momto3sons, I am also high-risk and so I know this probably won't be my last go around with the tumors that pop up, the biopsy, the waiting... The only thing I can hope is that, after this experience, even if they tell me again there's an 80% chance it's cancerous I'll be like \"okay but last time it turned out fine!\". So, focusing on the positive and trying to get back to normal :) Bless all of you dealing with this on a constant basis. I can only emulate your strength, you're all amazing!",

Glad it's nothing more, but being so young (just turned 30), and with a STRONG family history of bc, I'm thinking this is the beginning of many mammos/US's and benign breast conditions over the next few years... So thankful I found this site, as it's really opened my eyes to the world of my breasts and I've already learned so much just over the last month since my initial US!",

I\u2019m 30, they found a 1.2cm irregular mass in my left breast, I had a BIRADS 4c, as well, and they all thought it would be cancerous (I also have an insanely strong family history). Turns out to be a papilloma with ADH, so benign! When I went in for the surgery, the radiologist literally told me she was following my case because she thought it would be cancer and 2 people emailed her the results when it wasn\u2019t and she was so happy she had to come tell me herself! So there\u2019s still a good chance it\u2019s benign!! The report can only tell so much, until you get the pathology back, nothing can be proven. Keep us updated and I\u2019m sending good thoughts! x",
