I don't think I have what it takes to do this even once, let alone twice. I'm sending you some healing thoughts and prayers. Runningmom, You have raised some really good points about forming a plan of action. I hope I made the right decision to have the biopsy. I guess we just do the best we can with the information we have. How are you feeling now? Italychick, You are one brave soul. I just couldn't wait without totally obsessing. Though I probably will end up believing I opted out for an additional test I am now glad that I will know something tomorrow. I'm beginning to see that patience is not one of my strong points. Many thanks to everyone here who takes time out of their day to help me and others. Bless you all. ",

I am now waiting on a surgery consult and that is another two weeks away. I'm so new to all of this that I can't offer you any advice on what to expect, like the other members here can, but I just wanted to let you know that you are not alone in feeling anxious. I have a supportive family, but I'm finding this group to be more helpful to me than my family can be right now. My family is asking me all sorts of questions I have no answers to. They want me to hurry, hurry, hurry. It's the exact opposite of what I am feeling from the people here who have already walked, or are currently walking, this path. My family wants answers as quickly as I do, which I understand, but I'm quickly learning that I have to balance advocating for myself with trusting the process. Instead of pressuring me to make appointments quickly, which I've done but I can't create time these doctors don't have, the people here have validated how hard my wait is and encouraged me to be educated and proactive. You are not alone in this journey.",

I go on the 25th to consult with a surgeon and hopefully come up with a game plan for a biopsy. I have a feeling he'll suggest a lumpectomy which I'm starting to think may be the best way to go. I'm feeling a little odd about requesting that from the jump instead of doing a needle biopsy first and then having to have it removed anyway. As far as I'm concerned they can send it to pathology once they get it out of me. I struggle to know that I have the right to ask for what I want in this situation, but I'm going to anyway. If he can give me valid reasons for doing the needle biopsy first then, of course, I'll do that but not without being well informed. I am going to ask him if his intention is to definitely remove it either way then I'd rather him just go on and do it. So, I'm in the same boat as you. Don't poke around on me x number of times just to conclude what you knew already. Can I ask if there was concern about the small size of your lump and being able to obtain enough material to analyze? Yours is even smaller than mine and I'm concerned about that. I fear they'll poke around and not get it. It has to be easier to get a biopsy on a sizable tumor? I already know that it will have to be an ultrasound guided biopsy which I'm guessing indicated that it's harder to find. Well, I'm sending you healing thoughts and prayers and many thanks for sharing. Oh, did you ask for the ativan when you scheduled the biopsy or was that something they just offered day of. I totally don't like the idea of a needle going into my breast.",

      "Content": "notnow wrote: Please share your experience with having a surgery date before your diagnosis. Or, in other words, choosing to have a lumpectomy instead of an ultrasound guided needle biopsy. I am not sure I will have the choice, but I am pretty sure the lump has to be removed rather it's cancerous or not. I am trying to prepare myself for the surgery consult scheduled for the 25th. These are my thoughts: If the surgeon doesn't suggest lumpectomy as a starting off place I want to understand why. I understand the process only minimally, so bear with me. ha. I would think that with a birads 4 (and somewhere along the way I was able to distinguish between a 4a and 4c and determine that mine was a 4c but can't for the life of me can't remember the distinguishing characteristic but there was one), so 4c, strong family history of breast cancer, and it's a tiny nodule (6 x 6 x 2), which by the way, does that mean taller than wide? So, tiny nodules must be easier to remove and therefor cause less damage to remaining tissue than large ones, yes? If the surgeon doesn't suggest lumpectomy from the gate can I insist? I don't see myself being the type of person who can live life peacefully with a moderately suspicious nodule left to possibly grow. My aunts had the same type of cancer, but one was fast growing (she claims it went from 2cm to 4cm in two weeks and I'm not sure if this is important in my case anyway), and the other aunt had a less aggressive case, but the same type that grew slowly. She was denied immediate treatment because at the time she was considered too young to have a mastectomy. She was thirty-eight. The first aunt received treatment very quickly, had reconstruction and has not had any complications since. I believe her surgery was twenty five years ago. The second aunt, who had to wait two years before being taking serious and having the diagnosis that led to her first mastectomy later developed cancer in her left breast which led to her second mastectomy. She also developed uterine cancer in-between those mastectomies, which were seventeen years apart. So, I'm not panicking about waiting for the diagnosis, but more focused on having it removed either way. If that's my plan I'd rather avoid the expense and additional risks to my body from two procedures. I get that a needle biopsy isn't that bad, but still why do it? If I do do it that way, they'll still run pathology on it twice, right? I just can't see the added expense of all of that. The one exception to this theory that I've thought of, and this is where I need your input because I'm sure there are other reasons I don't know enough about to consider, is if they want to do a needle biopsy to determine if the cancer is the type that has spread to the point that I'd need chemo first. From what I've read the only real reason to do chemo first would be to shrink the tumor and that's not the case for me. Are there other reasons? Do they like to know in advance so they can order scans of other parts of the body? Do they always run scans before lumpectomies but not needle biopsies? Another interesting aspect is that my aunt was asked if she'd ever lived in a house that had asbestos. They both had the same kind of cancer first go around, though they can't tell me which kind they said it begins with an m. They're really so sweet but not well informed. The one aunt is still on hormone therapy for the second mastectomy, so it's hormone driven and she is going to ask her doctor the type for me. The first cancers they both had were not hormone driven. Neither of them are carriers, but they did live in the same house and I did, as a child, live there summers and weekends. Any insight you have on any of this information would be greatly appreciated. I am most interested in knowing what to ask the surgeon regarding having the lumpectomy first and how that process worked for you. Did they typically schedule it pretty quickly after your surgery consult? I have a nurse who's going to call me Monday morning for a fifteen minute session which I don't understand either. She already has more information about my case than I do. Log in to post a reply",

It sounds like you had a speedy and painless as possible treatment. This is what I'm shooting for. I no there are many things to consider, but love being involved in making an informed decision about my care. Hopefully I will have a lumpectomy and there won't be any cancer present and they can call it a day, but if not I want to know my options. Thanks for sharing the MRI and PET scan information, too. I understand that now and will be able to ask questions along the way. I can see, now, why they would want to biopsy the lymph nodes first. That makes perfect sense. I'm sure I'll read this again and again and come up with more questions. There is a lot of information to absorb, but I am keeping a list of questions as I go along. I've been able to cross some of those out by having the information revealed to me here. I'm so happy you have had a good outcome. I'm going to check out the March thread and learn through those who've traveled already. Cheers to you.",

This may correspond to the small mass seen superiorly on mammography. This is what my report says. It goes on to recommend an ultrasound guided biopsy and a surgery consult due to the moderately suspicious nature of the nodule and strong family history.",

She said, based on the information they received from the radiologist that a core needle biopsy would be my next step and that it was up to me if I waited for her to tell me that during my consultation on the 25th, or I could go ahead and schedule it at the hospital and have the pathology report when I came in. Since this is what the surgeon would recommend anyway, I've decided to go ahead with the needle biopsy. It may mean an extra test for me but it also may mean I saved myself some surgery. Either way they will put a marker in which will benefit future mammograms and the surgeon should they decide to remove it anyway. I did ask about the size of the nodule being a problem with getting tissue samples and she said that's the purpose of having an ultrasound guided procedure. She didn't seem to think it was an issue. This has been such a fearful time for me as I'm sure it is for all of us. I am so thankful for this group and the differing opinions and experience is so helpful to me. I know that all we can offer one another is our own journey and each journey has it's validating points. I just have to trust that the experts know what's best and that they are more removed from the emotionality of my situation and can make better decisions than I can. I believe, given my anxiety over this, that I'd have them be more aggressive than may be needed. Thanks to everyone who has helped me in making this oh so difficult decision. To whoever else may be facing the same decisions as me I just want to share with you that I have had some release of anxiety since making the decision to let the doctors run this show. Ha. There is a real possibility that they'll want to remove it anyway, should it be benign, but that would be mostly because of my strong family history. I'm cool with that now, too.",
