Four years later we are still cancer free and stay in touch in a special Facebook group. I just wanted to send you all a huge boatload of encouragement. Super glad you have each other. We all agree it made the world of difference for us. I've found chemo to be like labor. The memories of misery fade with time. Stay hydrated, don't be afraid to ask your MO anything, and stay on top of your pain. Those were my big take aways from my four cycles of TC. Big hugs to you!!! Bev",

I'd have the oncoplastic reduction done again in a heartbeat even though it turns out I'm a very slow healer. A word of caution if you end up with one of those spots that won't heal at the T junction, watch for infection and trust in your intuition. I was put on a wet-to-dry dressing and not not to sorry as it steadily got bigger instead of smaller. It eventually destroyed already healed tissue and grew to a 4x7 cm open wound before it was finally diagnosed with an infection. By then I was really sick and had to regrow a lot of skin. It took three different antibiotics to kill it and I've had my chemo delayed 2+ months because of it. It's been awful and I've been sleeping in a recliner since August so as not to stress the healing/new skin in that area. Trust your gut and don't be afraid to be pushy to get answers and results if you know something just isn't right.",
