I'm feeling very depressed this week and then I feel guilty because I feel like this. Like I should be able to be strong and just kick this things ass! Anyway, I tend to struggle with depression/anxiety normally, so this has just amped it up about 100x's. I really want to run away and pretend that this isn't really happening to me. I'm scared of the surgery and the treatments after. I was just diagnosed on 10/24 and I'm already worn out, how am I going to get thru the rest of this?? I truly don't think anyone around me gets this, how could they right? I feel alone, even though I've got tons of people asking to help. make sense?   Thanks for letting me vent.

How long does it take, or will it ever be right again? I feel fatigued a lot, foggy headed(not as bad as before), tummy stuff at times, aches and pains. I supposed some of this could be from Tamxofien too, but I just wonder what is realistic to expect? Some days are better than others for sure and for the most part things are much better than early after final chemo. So, I suppose things are heading in the right direction, right? :) I think my fatigue is what really bothers me the most :( anyone have anything on this?

I've had this drain in since NOV, but it was still putting out about 20-30 a day. There is a hole too...I am going to check again in a little bit. Has this happened to anyone???
