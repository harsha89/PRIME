Thursday I had some leakage then Friday morning I woke up with a puddle in the bed. My wonderful BS saw me that day and seemed to have taken care of the problem until yesterday. No major leakage just the bulb won't keep suction on the tube. Just very frustrating and I don't see the PS and BS til Friday. Just wondering if anyone has had this issue and how did you handle it. Any advice will be greatly appreciated! Log in to post a reply",

I hope your healing well now and God bless!",

I had a really good night last night and really thought I would feel so much better today. Unfortunately I didn't get a good nights sleep and then when the drain acted up all morning, I got frustrated because i wanted to get up and around more to build up my energy but everytime i did the bulb would lose suction. Therefore i went into a mood that I refer to as a FUNK! It's so good to get on here and know that other people have felt the same way and have gotten thru it. With Gods' help and my DH and loving family and friends this too shall pass :)  Also can someone tell me how to put the dx and stats at the bottom of my posts?",

I think the issue is that the nurse removed the tape from over the site the day after surgery when we left the hospital. My DH has been so good and did the right thing for a temporary fix. When we went to the BS last Friday the nurse pushed the tube back in the site a little just as my husband had done. The BS put new guaze and surgical tape over the area and a few inches down the tube. He said he was just trying to buy some time. It held until Sunday night Monday morning. It did pretty good yesterday then I had a lousy nights sleep just because of my back being uncomfortable and today it's been not wanting to hold the suction very well at all. My DH just came home for lunch and came to my rescue. I was cying from the frustration and he used a pair of hemostats and did just what the nurse did and WALAH fixed again Thank God. He put new tape over the bottom so hopefully it will hold this time. I just want to be able to get my energy back and this just seems to zap it with the frustration of not being able to get up and around without it loosing the suction. Sorry for rambling lol",

You def want to be in the hands of a specialist rather than a general surgeon. I had a mammogram and an ultrasound after I felt a lump. The mammogram didn't show anything and the ultrasound was inconclusive. My GP told me they suggest further testing but since I wanted it out no matter whether it was b9 or not he sent me to a general surgeon saying that he didn't think an MRI would give me any more of a definitive answer than the Ultrasound. The general surgeon said there are 3 criteria they look for with malignancy and mine didn't seem to fit those so he would just remove the lumps. Well suprise, suprise after surgery he told my DH something looked suspicious and 5 days later I got the DX of IDC with neither margin clear. His response for not getting clear margins was that he didn't think he was doing a cancer surgery. Thank God for good friends and family who encouraged us to go to a Breast cancer specialist. It was the best decision we could have ever made. Good luck and God bless and I hope to see that all will be B9. Keep us posted",

Since this is not your 1st pregnancy you know that this isn't just something that happens due to pregnancy. You have to be proactive and demand some testing. It's your body, your life and not their right to just blow it off. It may be something as simple as an infected milk duct. But you  will be much better off having it checked now for your sake and you babies. A stressed mommy is not good for either of you. Please keep us updated and God Bless!!",

I had a large palpable area and a smaller pea like lump and neither of them showed on the Mammo and the sonogram was inconclusive. I wanted them removed no matter what and to everyones suprise including the Dr. and the general surgeon it was IDC. I'm not saying this to scare you and I pray that it is benign. Just please insist on a biopsy to be sure. Good luck and God Bless",
