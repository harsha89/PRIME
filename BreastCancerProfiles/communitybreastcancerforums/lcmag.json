My panic attacks came at the oddest of times - I obviously had called a number of my friends and family to let them know of the diagnosis, but when it came time to SEE these very same people, I started having panic attacks.  The first one came when I was on my way to my mother's house - I mean, it's my MOM for the love of pete!  Then I would get them on the way HOME from work when I had an appointment the following day. Did you ever get any medicine for panic attacks?  Does the ambein help you sleep?  I'm really considering asking for something, even if it's just for Sunday nights when the hot flashes are worst.  But I'll try taking the Ativan first, see if that helps.",

Just back from the doctor in prep for starting Taxol (12 treatments) on August 28th.  Thanks to you all here, I was able to talk to my doctor about the Benedryl, which I generally don't react well to, so THANK YOU!  I'm going to take an over the counter Benedryl the night prior and then will have half the amount of IV Benedryl. I also got a perscription for Nexium to start taking NOW because I already have a little bit of hearburn that will probably get worse. For Neuropathy:  Take 100mg of B6 and 60mg of Zinc EVERY DAY, begin this regimen prior to yoru first Taxol and you shouldn't struggle with it. The doctor also indicated that people who do 12 weekly treatments tend to fare better on the SEs because the dosage is smaller.  Of course, over time the SEs can get worse for those who do 12 treatments because of the cumulative effect. I was supposed to start this week, but i needed a break, i need to feel normal for a little bit.  In regard to the mojo issues, my fiancee and I have not cut this out entirely, but I do have some suggestions if you will bare with my directness:  1) make sure your partner isn't overly manscaped.  any stubble, heck even short hairs can cause a lot of pain.  2)  use a lubricant.  Astroglide is wonderful.  3) GO SLOWLY. it will hurt less, it will give the lubricant a chance to work its way into where it needs to be and as mentioned above, it DOES increase the sensuality of the act. Have a peaceful day, ladies.  Be well, take care, and hang in there!  Hugs to you all. ",

I can now count down my weekly taxol treatments on one hand!!!  5 more left then chemo will be behind me.  My good pal in the infusion room will be finishing up her Taxol on Friday, and they have this wonderful tradition of ringing a bell when you walk out from your last treatment. I cannot wait to see her ring that bell and walk out those doors, hopefully forever! I have not been taking the Zoloft prescribed by my oncologist for hot flashes.  Instead I'm taking 1000mg of Vit E daily and on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights using the Ativan to help me sleep.  It's doing the trick and I don't have to wait 2 weeks for the Zoloft to kick in and maybe work, maybe not. My fingernails are horrid, and my toenails are swiftly following suit.  I've chopped them down as far as I can, but they look just awful!  Eyebrows are coming in, but are so fine that you can hardly see them!  My hair is filling in nicely, I may be able to go without a scarf by the end of November! Do any of you have trouble keeping/getting warm after a particularly bad night of hot flashes/night sweats?  It happens to me one night per week, but I get so cold that I simply cannot warm up.  Layers of clothing and blankets, heating pad, hot shower....none of it helps.  It will releive itself in about 5 hours, but those 5 hours are tough.  They usually come around 3am, too.  Very strange! I hope everyone does well this week with treatments, s/es, whatever you have on your plate. Hang in there!",

The infusion was about 90 minutes, I felt slightly sleepy after the IV benedryl, but nothing terrible.  After treatment I went shopping at Kohl's. Friday night was fine - no SEs so to speak of, but I found it very hard to get to sleep, and to stay asleep.  The doctor said next week won't be as bad because I won't have as many of the steriods in my system. Saturday had a great day - the weather was perfect, I felt very, very good.  We went to look at a couple of houses, ate some great BBQ and really enjoyed the day. Sunday had a great morning and felt fine!  The fatigue didn't really start until the late afternoon, and I only needed one nap.  Sunday night wasn't so great, I'm really struggling with hot flashes at night (4 or 5 times), and while they only last a couple minutes, it's a disruption to your sleep that you really don't need. I haven't been experiencing any bone pain at all, which I know is a blessing. I saw my surgeon last week to check on swelling under my arm on the side of my axillary dissection - turns out that my new tote bag is too heavy and the straps are rubbing a 'void area' where a cluster of lyph nodes used to be (I had 26 removed).  The rubbing is causing fluid to fill the area, and the fluid is causing the swelling.  I did not realize how very careful I need to be when using this arm or carrying and lifting things with this arm.  It has only been 3 months since surgery, so I should give it more time and care. After this weeks' treatment, I will be halfway through with chemo.  It's a very exciting. Be well ladies.",

I had #9 of 12 Taxol treatments last week, and tomorrow is #10 - 3 more treatments and 2 weeks until chemo is over for me.  I'd like to get very excited, but since I had that set back 2 weeks ago, and had to miss treatment, I know that things can change in a day.  So maybe I'll start getting excited after I get treatment tomorrow. My Onc still won't let me schedule the measuring appointment with the Radiologist, and I think he might have me wait 2 weeks after chemo ends - I had really hoped to go straight through to radiation after chemo, but now he's saying I'll need to let my body rest.  I guess I'm okay with that. My eyelashes are growing back and it's a little uncomfortable!  The stubble is very itchy and collects \"eye crusties\" all day long - a small price to pay, I know.  I'd really like to see more eyebrows, but they are staying away. My hair is growing like crazy, but not ALL over.  It's strange, the places where I had the 'fuzzies' during a/c are bald now.  The fuzzies fell out about 2 weeks into Taxol, but my other hair had started to grow back, so it has been strange.  If only the bald spots were in the back, I would be tempted to go out without my scarves. Do any of you have any swelling in your ankles/feet?  I've noticed that happening at the end of every day, some days it's tender, too. For those of you with bad neuropathy, have you tried the B6/Zinc combo?  Daily, take 100mg of B6 and 60mgs of Zinc.  That kept 99% of the neuropathy at bay for me until just recently.  I started adding glutamine powder as well at the recommendation of one of the oncology nurses, and the little tingles that started went away.  I strongly recommend both courses of action.

However, I don't know about your chances of getting ovarian cancer AFTER a positive breast cancer diagnosis and treatment.  Does anyone else? My biggest fear right now is a recurrance, and I've not even completed treatment!  I considered a double mastectomy anyway, but both my oncologist and breast surgeon said it wasn't necessary at this point, that I was being too alarmist/aggressive.  But if I discover another lump, if I have to get yet another biopsy........ I think I'll go with the double mastectomy. Hang in there!",

So you park the car, walk into the radiation suite and have a seat.  At your scheduled time they call you back and you get changed into a gown (waist up) and sit in the waiting area.  One of the nurses comes to get you and you go into the radiation room, lay on the table.  The techs come and align your tattoos (i got an additional one today, that makes 4) then they leave and in about 3-4 minutes you're DONE! After the radiation I had some warmth in the area, and some tingle-zingy sensations.  The tingles and the warmth went away quickly, but the zingy feelings are still there and completely normal from what I am told. My tumor was only .9 centimeters, but I had 4 cancerous nodes out of the 26 that were removed, so stage IIIa for me.  My cancer was removed surgically prior to chemo - all my pre-chemo scans were clear so radiation is precautionary.

I wrote out this whole long post yesterday, but left it in preview and navigated away from the website, so it never posted!  Here I am trying again. Thursday night I was directed to take 1 over the counter Benedryl (25mg), 1 Xantac Max (150mg) and 12mg of Decadron (3 pills).  I slept fine and my appointment was at 10am. I had some blood drawn Friday morning, then saw the doctor who ASSURED me that these treatments wouldn't be as horrible as a/c.  I had been participating in a clinical trial with Avastin, but dropped out because a/c was so hard on me that I no longer wanted to put anything in my body that did not absolutely HAVE to be there.  After dropping out of the study I learned from the research nurse and another oncologist that people who receive the Avastin during the study always report worse SEs.  That is a little tidbit that I would have liked to have known PRIOR to entering into the study, but the water has long since flowed under that bridge. Taxol infusion was 90 minutes (compared to my usual 3+ hour a/c infusion) and I felt fine!  A little sleepy from the additional Benedryl that was administered via the iv, but other than that.....nothing!  Friday night I slept well, Saturday we had our usual weekend routine with NO injection interruptions.  On a/c I had to return to the hospital every day for 8 days to receive a neupergin shot. Sunday afternoon I started getting a little sleepy and feeling some fatigue. I didn't fight it, so I napped off and on through the afternoon and into the evening.  Monday I came to work - first time since starting chemo that I was actually able to work after chemo!  I didn't stay the whole day, because I was getting very tired, but I did stay until a bit after 1pm and then went home and napped. I did not feel nauseaus at all from the Taxol!  I did throw up yesterday, but that was because I took too many vitamins and not enough food for breakfast - my fault! I've been taking 100mgs of B6 and 60mgs of Zinc daily along with my multi-vitamin.  I also take a perscription nexium daily to combat the heartburn that the steriods cause.  Ask your doctors about doing the same.  Don't wait for issues to become a problem (like the heartburn and the neuropathy) before you address them! I am so happy that the SEs haven't been bad - and I did not have to have a Neulasta shot this first go-around, and I hope that continues.  My hair isn't growing back yet - but the peach fuzz I never lost has started to get a bit longer.  Maybe that is a sign that the rest of it may start poking through any day.  I can't tell you how often I stare into the mirror almost willing the hair follicles to grow, dammit!  I'm so sick of being bald.  I just want enough coverage to feel confident going out of the house without my scarves.  I have a wig that I haven't worn even once!  It's been so hot here this summer, and the wig is terribly itchy and hot. My fingernails have started doing really peculiar things, but someone who traveled this road before us suggested cutting the painful nails down as short as you can - and that has helped.  I'm not sure what can be done about the bumps in the nail bed or the digs and ridges..... i don't much care about it being unsightly, as long as it doesn't hurt!",

I had some regrowth of hair in between a/c and taxol...well, maybe it was a fuzzy regrowth, ha ha...and that has all fallen out.  It was a little traumatic, because for the first time since losing everything, I was seeing the hairs on the pillow and inside my scarves again.  I really miss my hair.  I wonder how long it will take to fully \"cover\" my scalp once it does start growing back?  A month, maybe 2?  One of the cancer-support staff said you won't need a haircut until 6 months after treatment.",

He found a 'ridge' in the left breast (the one I call 'the OTHER one') that he wants me to have checked out with the breast surgeon.  Now, I've had a weird spot in that breast always - during my mammograms I have to have the left breast imaged 2 different ways.  I actually have to lean OVER the machine, and dangle my breast into the plates.  I'm pretty sure this is the same ridge the Onc felt on Friday - but I have been scared to death ever since. I know - all my pre-chemo scans came back clear, and the liklihood of a cancerous tumor creating itself and growing to the point where it can be felt in 3.5 months WHILE ON CHEMO is pretty damn slim.  But I still had to take 1mg of Lorazepam to sleep last night.  My appointment is at 3pm today. Other than that, the Taxol SEs are the same old, same old.  One toe on my right foot has gone numb, but it's not painfull or annoying, so I don't really care.  If that starts going on with my fingers I'll mention it to the doctor. Hair is definitely growing back.  It's darkening up, and really, really soft!  My eyebrows are back, eyelashes are coming in. Please pray for me today that the 'ridge' the oncologist felt is just my regular fibrous breast tissue, and not another form of cancer.  I just don't think I could take it if it's another cancer.",

I don't have any serious discomfort, but when I get home at night I do need to get out of my bra straight away and put on a bra-top tank top and rub a LOT of calendula gel on everything. I've been using Tom of Maine's deoderant and cornstarch for my armpit, but the nurse said to put the cornstarch on the breast as well, to help with any chaffing.

At my last visit with my Oncologist, he wants me to do twice yearly infusions of Zofran, which is an osteoperosis medication shown to reduce the recurrance rates of breast cancer in post-menapausal women.  I'm going to go for it!

I had my 4th Taxol treatment on Friday, and really, everything has proceeded exactly as the last 3!  I feel fine Friday afternoon and evenings, fine Saturday during the day, but a little tired at night.  Sunday morning is good, but by Sunday afternoon it's time to find the couch and some good tv! Monday I work a half day, come home and sleep for the rest of the afternoon.  I feel mostly back to normal today, but that fatigue seems to seep around the edges, if you know what i mean. I had one fingernail starting to fall off, now I have 4.  Both thumbs along with the index and middle finger of the right hand.  The nails are detaching from the top down and are about halfway off.  I think I'm just going to put one of those teeny tiny bandaids over the top, so no gunk or dirt can get under the nail.  It doesn't hurt, but it sure looks peculiar - i'm sure it will look worse when/if they actually fall out. My eyebrows are like rats on a sinking ship - but oddly enough, 3 days after they fall out, they start growing back again, only really fine and thin.  The eyelashes just fall out!  I have not noticed any hair regrowth so far, and I'm starting to wonder if hair regrowth on Taxol is just a myth. The hot flashes are still there, still waking me up 4-5 times a night.  My doctor reccommended Vit. E, so I've been taking that daily since Saturday.  I can't say that I've noticed any difference.  He offered to give me a mild anti-depressant to help me sleep, but I'm at a point where I really don't want to put anything in my body that isn't ABSOLUTELY necessary.  I actually had to go out and buy one of those daily pill organizers to keep all the medicines straight, and to make sure I'm taking the proper meds on the correct days! Have any of you heard about doing chemo and rads at the same time?  I'm scheduled to have my final Taxol treatment on 11/13, and I would like to overlap the radiation treatments (24) for the last 2 weeks of chemo, so that I'm done the week prior to Christmas.  I have heard of a couple of people at the cancer center doing both, but I haven't heard of any breast cancer patients doing them at the same time.  A question about working was asked last week - my treatments are on Friday, so I take the morning off and work from home in the afternoons.  On Mondays I work half of the day at the office and the other half at home.  Tuesday - Thursday I work full time at the office.  My employer has been phenominal to me during my diagnosis, surgery and treatment.  There has never been a discussion about short or long term disability, I can go home when I feel tired, come in early or late if I need to, etc.  I can't imagine how I would have gotten through as much as I have without their complete and unwavering support.  I know it has made a huge difference on my stress levels and my feeling like a productive member of the community, which is important to me.  I'm not a work-a-holic by any means, but I enjoy my job, I enjoy being here and maintaining my routine.  They have supported me in that this whole time, and I am truly blessed to be a part of this organization.

Had my 4th Taxol on Friday and everything has been exactly the same as the 3 previous.  I feel great on Friday and Saturday, okay Sunday morning, tired Sunday afternoon and exhausted Sunday night. I find the hot flashes and night sweats to be the absolute WORST on Sunday nights, and I can't sleep for more than 40 minutes without having to either rip OFF the covers or pull them back on.  The doctor prescribed me a very low dose of Zoloft, but I have some fears about taking it. I've never been a person who struggles with depression - anxiety and worry are more my forte - and when I was first diagnosed and undergoing all those surgeries, I started having panic attacks.  I was able to practice some breathing excercises that got me through them, but until I started on a/c, I was having them often.  I am fearfull that the Zoloft will either bring back the panic attacks or make me unable to stop them on my own. When I was on a/c they gave me a perscription for Ativan, and that helped me with nausea but made me extremely tired.  I think I will try the Ativan that I have left over on Sunday nights and see if that will at least allow me to sleep.  If so, I'd rather refill that perscription that start the zoloft.  Also, it takes about 2 weeks for the Zoloft to take effect and by that time, I'll only have 3 more weeks left on taxol..........is it worth introducing another chemical into my body?  I'm just not sure. My eyebrows are growing back after literally JUST falling out!  My eyelashes, too.  It's amazing, really.  My fuzzies all fell out and REAL HAIR started growing back!  My fiancee said to me last weekend that my head was finally soft again, and not pricking him.  I noticed just this morning that it's taking on a darker color, too.  I think this might actually be my real hair.  Real hair is growing back in OTHER places too - places that haven't seen hair since I last shaved on the freaking Fourth of July.  It's all very fine, light hair.  My fingernails are a mess, tho.  I have 6 that are splitting at the nail bed and my pinky toe nails will probably be gone by the end of the week, if they last that long.  While it looks gross, as long as I am not in any pain or feeling any discomfort, I can deal with it. I think I may be getting some finger-tip numbing, but it's so hard to tell, because I've cut my fingernails back very short, and with all the anti-bacterial hand gel I've been using, the skin is so dry and cracked. All in all, I have been feeling very positive lately.  I feel like I can see the end and getting there might not be as hard as getting to THIS point.  Be well today, ladies!  Take a moment and do something for yourself, even if it's 5 minutes of peace while looking at the start of the fall folliage.  You deserve it!",

Thank you everyone for the thoughts and prayers - I met with my breast surgeon on Monday afternoon and she did a very thorough exam of both breasts.  The \"ridge\" that the oncologist felt was just the transition from breast tissue to chest muscle.  She even had me feel where the same ridge occurs on the right breast, but because of the surgeries on that breast and the residual swelling, you really have to kind of dig in to feel it. I could not beleive the releif that swept over me.  I had been pre-occupied with this 'ridge' all damn weekend - terrified that something else was growing inside me.  I appreciate that my oncologist is so thorough and cautious, but I really didn't need the stress!  Now that I feel like I can breathe again, I got another recommendation for something to assist with the neuropathy: glutamine powder.  You take 2 tablespoons a day.  I have developed some numbness in one toe and 2 fingers, so we will see if this reverses it or just prevents it from getting worse. I took 2 Ativan on Sunday night and slept like a baby!  I think I'll have the doctor refill this perscription instead of starting on the Zoloft.  I only have 6 treatments left (I get them on Fridays), and I'd rather just take the Ativan on the days I know I can't sleep (Friday & Sunday) than take something every day.

In regard to the racing thoughts/anxiety it sounds like a bit of post-traumatic stress, but remember that we've had something MAJOR to think about in our heads over the last year.  Something that is always there, nagging at you, creeping into your other thoughts.  It's hard to \"turn off\" your brain when it's been working overtime for so long. Now that Di doesn't have the cancer to think about 24/7, her mind is trying to find other things to obsess about.  Di would do well to talk to her primary care physician about anti-anxiety medications coupled with counseling.  She just needs to teach her brain that it's okay to be at rest.  I've been taking lorazepam (.50mg)when my anxiety gets too much and I can't turn my head off, but I have been relying on it less and less as each week passes.
