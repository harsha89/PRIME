Especially being young and naive many things are new and scary to us, especially feeling your first lump that you never knew was there, or knew was there but ignored it from being scared. When it comes to breast health, us women are more prone to thinking on the negative side about lumps, indents, and breast changes. Confronting someone you love and who brought you to this world is very stressing and scary, especially because you dont want them to worry. You should feel confident!! I'm sure your mom will be understanding and will want you to be honest with her at the end of the day. Dont feel scared, the more you wait the more stressful its going to be and that stress wont make breast worries or any worries better. I guarantee you will feel much more at ease telling your mom, not only that you will have someone who you trust and love to be by your side throughout this. I confronted my mom after I went to the breast ultrasound. I didn't feel right not letting her know that i'm getting one, especially on my breast! Breast indents, can be caused for many reasons, fibrous tissue, maybe the indent looks like a stretch mark.. On behalf of your anxiety and worry towards your breast indent, get it checked out by a doctor. Dont waste time ignoring the issue because your worried, it will just make you stressed. I'm here for you! Keep me updated :) P.S thanks for wishing me B9 results! :)",

She sent me to another better quality ultrasound, to compare the two sonography's. Fingers crossed, hopefully after that its still nothing. P.S hope everyones well!",

The hospital told me I needed to get a copy of my ultrasound video to take to this hospital...? Kinda weird but whatever. Apparently the breast doctor wants to take a better look at it and examine my breast before suggesting a biopsy. Btw, i've been non-stop researching stuff thats on my radiologist report. I dont know how the height width and size go on these reports but.. apparently (taller than wide) are more commonly malignant, and (wider than tall) are commonly benign. My breast nodule thats hyperechoic has a long axis parrallel to my chest wall. Usually fibroadenomas are wider than thinner. I'm freaking out.. I just keep searching and searching.",

The Radiologist favors its likely a beign entity, possibly a small fibroadenoma. He recommends a 6 month follow-up to ensure stability. The right breast appears normal. On the left side which I never even knew I had something is were the bad stuff starts to begin, and when my heart stopped. On the left side at the upper outer quadrant at 2-3 o'clock there is a well-defined hyperechoic nodule at 2.9cm. It has a long axis parallel to my chest wall. This could be on the basis of a fibroadenoma or possibly a hamartoma. Appears however nonspecific and I would recommend proceeding to ultrasound guided core biopsy. On my BIRADS categories i'm in 4.

I would suggest you do get the appointment so you can feel better knowing your taking charge of the situation. As for college, if your planning to attend in fall that's a long time from now, and I guarantee your situation will be dealt with before then. To be very honest, I can only stop my mind from going at worst scenarios for probably about 15 minutes. My mind just goes right back to being negative and thinking the worst. It's Friday here in Canada and I have another 2 days before my appointment at the hospital. Try to read a book, workout, go out with friends, be around people that make you feel happy and talk to them, dont keep your thoughts to yourself because it will make you feel so much better knowing someone understands. Dont search stuff on google, thats what I do everyday and every hour since I heard I have a some non-specific appearances on my breast nodule. If your on summer break enjoy it! At the end of the day, you're only 18 and breast cancer in your age group is very very uncommon. Keep me updated ",
