I started my steroids this morning, too. On top of it, I had to have surgery yesterday (2 little things breast surgeon saw after my main tumor was confirmed cancerous under Ultrasound guided biopsy). Already hadsurgery last week for port. Both doctors approved the surgery yesterday,even if I was to start chemo this Thursday, but I was not thrilled at having wire localization procedure in MRI, and surgery to remove the areas identified in one day! Surgery was delayed,so I hadn't eaten anything since midnight before...21 Hours with no food. After I came out to recovery I was so nauseaus, and had to 'reverse' given  empty stomach. As they say 'it will all go in the book'. I have a huge sense of humor, though. In my basket, among other things, I also have nausea patch, nausea pills, anxiety pills, Allegra 180 (I was already taking allergy meds, and she said I could use in lieu of Claritin for the possible Neulasta bone pain. Plus Acidophilus (Ok'd with doctor) as I tend to have sensitive system. Aquafor for hands and feet......crazy how much OTC stuff we all use to counteract some of the actual prescription meds, LOL. Good luck everyone-I've been learning so many tips and absorbing positivity from these boards!:) ",

Fantastic experience at center-saw my Onc, went in for finger prick to double check my WBC again, and they took more blood once I was plugged in to verify kidneys were functioning properly. Aside from being tired (could have been not sleeping previous night due to apprehension about 1st treatment, or the Adivan I took, just in case). The other  weird side effect was that I started sneezing when the Cytoxofan was dripping through and had some strange tingling in my head. Lasted a few minutes and I informed the nurse. She said it was a mild alergic reaction no cause for alarm. Funny thing for me was, that for years I had been on immuno therapy for severe allergies to cats, pollen, and all other indoor, outdoor allergens. My shots were suspended when I knew I had to have chemo. And I rarely need any allergy medicine by mouth, since my  therapy at Allergist went so well. Leave it to chemo to make me sneeze, haha! I've been moisturizing my hands and feet with 'Aquaphor' which doc recommended, and taking all meds exactly as scheduled.  I kept the nurses laughing, and they were all wonderful to me. Overall, what I expected. I know more severe side effects are still to come, but at least my 1st treatment is done, and I was galvanized against some others with the pre-meds they gave me. Anti-nausea patch seems to work well for me, thus far. A little constipated, too, but I am working on additional fluid intake, and may go buy some prune juice. Have Neulasta shot at 2pm today, and will bring friend with me just in case. I will be taking Allegra 180 ahead of time-doc said it was fine to take this instead of Claritin, especially since I already have some at home, from my multi-year Allergy treatments with other doc. Here's to hoping everyone does well over the next few days and focuses on the big picture-to excorcise these demons out our bodies!",

Sorry for being a little detailed but if anyone has any specific tips for the 3 am 'backup', I'd love a PM if you have a sec (and yes I will ask Onc on Mon for something to help this along if needed). They put me through mill, chest x-ray, blood work, urine. White Count 6000, and no infection. Just in case send me hope with Antibiotics. Have follow up appt with Onc Monday anyway (that was to be my White Blood Cell test). It's possible I didn't drink enough that day (definitely corrected that now). Got so frustrated I downed a whole  glass of organic prune juice. Mayhem ensued in my system after that, but it did work within just 1 hour (crazy). My system has always been tricky, so I thought I was being good with Acidophilus (told it was ok, given my generally 'moody dig system) and eating really balanced (everything from high fiber to low fiber food). Just wanted to vent-5 hours to find out all was ok (thank goodness and I appreciated quick responsiveness of Onc when fever wouldn't go down despite compresses etc).  Was looking forward to Olympics (and watched at hospital and DVR at home today). Hard dealing with being 'on guard' all the time with my body-used to being healthy before all this. Thanks for listening to my rant. Second treatment 8/9. Whew. New day tomorrow:)",

      "Content": "Aug 1, 2012 09:04PM - edited Aug 1, 2012 09:31PM by boobzilla Hey Melsrose and PAEagles Fan- Thank you guys for the hair responses. I took the start of my hair falling out much harder than I thought I would. I noticed my hair in my nether region starting to come out yesterday and it's worse today. I thought I could ward off a breakdown but it happened at home, eventhough I've been pretty strong about all this thus far, as has my wife. I took a shower, and my hair on my head gathered in the drain about 1.5 times of what it usually does. So this is all about 12 days after my first TAC treatment (7/19). The shop at the 'spa' where I am being treated said my wig should be in tomorrow, and I just FEDEXED myself 2 sleep caps. I also have a 'hat with hair' at home, that I got at the same shop a few weeks ago, as a pre-emptive strike, LOL. Not looking forward to shaving my hair off, but I won't let it come out in clumps. Just hoping the wig fits (I go to work on my good week and a half, and though my boss is ok with me wear my 'hat with hair', it would be nice if I had some 'full hair' option as a security blanket of sorts and ego booster. Been a strange few days for sure....feel like I am going through puberty down south, and on the verge of being committed up north (joking). What a bizarre, fast and (often) unpredictable ride, whew! Teeballmom-great post-the psychological toll this takes on families and individuals is often way underestimated in the 'fog' (no pun intended),  of the actual medical treatment that needs to occur for obvious reasons. The need for support for mere 'coping' with this (and there are great support groups out there, as well as other 'complementary' services and treatments for mental well-being), is an area that often falls through the cracks via insurance and because of the breakneck speed with which all of this occurs. I am so glad you had a chance to tap an expert to help you put things in perspective-counseling and non-medical therapy continue to be 'must haves' for any person or family dealing with something emotionally complex like this, and the anger, confusion, uncertainty, and overall emotional tornado from diagnosis, to treatment/surgery and beyond. For most, the time span in between finding out, and jumping right into this often physically and mentally annihilating treatment/side effect combo is quick, and doesn't allow for much 'processing' by the person herself, and/ or the loved ones, which makes this even harder than it is already. The best I guess we can do, is get as much help as we can for the various aspects of this experience, and each day, reset the clock (again), to re-focus on the task at hand-to get beyond this in terms of our bodies, health, self esteem (don't even want to see or touch my left breast, damnit!),etc.  Strength and hugs to everyone here weathering this crazy storm-may many, many, many more better days be ahead, than tough and seemingly insurmountable ones that crop up in interim. I, myself, am currently in 'recovery' mode and at work-feeling back to my old self, generally). # 2 of TAC is 8/9-hope to have learned from some mistakes (poop drama, lack of adequate hydration on some days, etc), and take the next one on with less hitches.  But to say that I am not a little bit of a trainwreck at this very moment currently with hair nonsense, resentment would be a little bit of an understatement. I am as strong for everyone else and myself, as I can be, but I am definitely starting to come undone a little.  Plus the usual 'WTF! I am 36, I thought I had a fracking 'deep tissue bruise'!!!' 'Just started seriously considering starting a family', 'Having a hard time planning anything', yadda yadda.  And I've had a 2nd biopsy scare in same breast, for which I needed last minute surgery (2 days before 1st chemo!), and am still store, but was benign'. Still....rowin' on in same 'July chemo boat' (is there an 'Olympics Team Logo for that?) as you all...and still more surgery, radiation and hormone treatment ahead (UGH!). Can't get to the finish line, otherwise. Bah! Trying to maintain my sense of humor through this @%&*#^&*(@ storm, however.",

Before next treatment I will see breast surgeon for check in.   My least favorite SE is the mental fog and exhaustion, which for me lasts about 4-6 days or so. I said from the beginning I would not let my weight drop,as my Oncologist and Nurse Pract emphasized that nutrition, caloric intake, and filtering toxins out of kidneys and blood as the chemo runs through, were of utmost importance. So, though my taste buds are slightly affected, as is my sense of smell (like a spidey sense!), my appetite is good and I continue to eat everything I was eating before.  Recently I didn't want to eat anything 'smokey'.  I did get tired of plain water pretty quick, but I just mixed in a shot of apple, cranberry juice, or gatorade or other drinks to mix it up. It definitely feels like my side effects are dragging a bit longer than they were earlier on, which the doctor said may happen (cumulative), but I take good care of my skin scalp, and overall mental well being (besides the occasional breakdown of course) , by staying as active as I can (friends, social functions, time spent with wife, and just good 'ol stress relief). Monday, for the first time in years I got out my Tennis racuet from High School and hit for 20 min or so with my wife. I had cleared it with doctor during last chemo, and as long as I don't overdo it they said it was good for me. I get my treatments Thursdays and Neulasta shot Friday, and then am quite annihilated for 5-6 days between all the digestive (I get constipated) and other lovely side effects. This past Saturday I went to a pro Baseball game and Sunday to a good friend's baby shower. So the Monday I went back to work I was a little tired (I go out for 11 days for treatment and recovery and then go back to work for 7 days before next treatment).  But the work and its regular stressors have helped keep my mind sharp and engaged in my 'professional' life as much as possible, which for me has helped tremendously.   I just want this thing to shrink enough to get it out of me, and then start the next phase (radiation)....ugh.",

After having accumulated numerous leadership and leadership certificates and awards over the years, that was definitely an interesting and unexpected and surreal experience. My godzilla has shrunken, and on 11/12 I see my breast surgeon so assess the tumor once more and schedule MRI and discuss surgery. After that next phase-radiation.

Whether a long road lies ahead for us, or one has already passed, the shared experience, for me, personally has been a life safer to keep my relativity in check. This will always be a part of my life now, but all of you have helped me float me through what has been the hardest thing I have ever faced, personally, mentally and emotionally, at 36. My wife and I have taken all of your collective support and suggestions to the chemo chair every treatment and talked at length about this 'collective' experience with each other to keep us strong and to keep us hopefully and thankful.",

My Onc told me this is the reason they periodically rescan you (MUGA) as you go through treatment. I periodically experience weird heart beats and fluttering, but it comes and goes. Good luck-hopefully it is just this one drug stressing your system a bit and it will pass. Never fun to have to worry about another thing, especially as we all weather our main storm of recovery. Marianne-I do get completely random shooting pains all over. Not necessarily in bones (I take Allegra and it has worked for me, as the 'bone pain' is apparently a histimine reaction, which Allegra has effectively blocked for me). But like throughout body-funny you mention 'fireworks'-that's how I described it to my partner. I'll be sitting somewhere, and all of a sudden, it just starts, like someone is pinching and stabbing me hard in random places...very strange. I think hair is different, but for my TAC regimen, my Oncologist said probably within 10-14 days after 1st streatment, but some still have their hair after 2nd and 3rd treatment. ",

My wife and I talked at length about this yesterday,because we both rationally know that the main objective needs to be getting rid of the cancer 'inside' of me. For me, and maybe for most, the hair is the first true 'outward' thing I am 'losing' to the disease, if you will, and I guess I hate the fact, that aside from my sanity, and all of this fear and shock my body has been through (biopsy, some surgery, scars, and the overall rollercoaster from diagnosis to now), that I have to also 'give up' other things in interim,  while this is eradicated. My friends (some of which I've known for several decades) keep reminding me that I am defined by who I am as a woman-inside, the things I do, my heart, my actions, and my wife repeatedly says she'd rather have me on this earth, regardless if it's bald, nauseaus etc, than the alternative, of course. So over the last few days, I have tried to re-center, as my hair is shedding. It's a hard trade off, because you see yourself every day, and we 'take for granted' how we look, brushing our hair, or whatever you do with it. I wish you the best in working through this-it's not easy, but  in the 'grand scheme of things', we need to let our loved ones cope, too, as they are losing a little part of us, that they've  grown accustomed to, as well. After all is said and done though and we remain standing after this journey, hopefully we'll all look back and see the hair as a small blip and sacrifice in the name of reclaiming our bodies from this disease. Hugs and encouragement to both you and your boyfriend:) Nat-I know at one point some of us were talking about a 'firecracker' type sensation all over our bodies. To curb or eliminate the 'bone pain', I was told to take Claritin or the Allegra 180 I already took previously for allergies, 1 hour before Neulasta shot I get 1 day after my infusion. The Allegra 180 is stronger mg-wise than the Claritin in my case, and it worked. I did have some 'minor' bone pain, here and there (literally, completely at random), but it was nothing like what it could have been, based on what I read and doctor said. But, I also had this weird shooting pain all over (even in muscles, too). It was not constant, but I'd be sitting somewhere and then all of a sudden I got little sharp pains, here and there, like I was being stabbed by little needles. It was really weird. Someone here summed it up as 'firecrackers' and I thought 'that's it!'. I am not sure if your 'twitching' is something like this, but you could always mention it to Onc just to be sure, so you can describe exactly how you are feeling and make sure it's a legit side effect, and not something else. So odd, all of these random side effects aren't they? Makes for a long list of strange 'odds and ends'.....smiles and hugs to you!",

My boss is out with the flu, one of my co-workers is out with Pneumonia, and my other co-worker has been sneezing and sniffling on the other side of my cube for days. Since I was advised to not take any vitamins as it could interfere with my chemo, I am hoping that my crazy nutritious eating since this nightmare began, together with the white blood cell shot to boost my system, will save me from any other BS invaders, LOL. Stay strong mama, hope blood draw went well. Ann-we need to snip that 'on hold' episode out and put it into the 'Chemo Chronicles' book to come. I have dense breasts too, and felt the same when I got a bill for my MRI the breast surgeon initially ordered after the 'staple' Mammogram, which is basically like taking a polaroid in the digital age. But insurance company told me to ignore the bill and that it had been 'put through wrong'. Breast care advisor and customer service resolved this on my behalf. Hang in there, but the phone on speaker and get yourself a 'hang from the ceiling' kickbox bag so when those annoying recordings (last thing we need to hear) come on, you have 'something' to punch.

I hope everyone continues to weather the storm, through the tears, aches and pains, and yes, laughs. I've not been around in a while, because I've been busy and emotional as well. Not 'stay in bed' emotional just volatile and a 'bit crazy'. My poor wife has had to endure this all, but at least we are able to talk about it. Well, I am going into treatment # 5 of 6 on Oct 11 (this Thursday),and will see my wonderful Onc before the infusion for yet, another palpation. And of course in between my breast surgeon has asked to see me every 2 weeks to palpitate as well. In between it all, I got fed up with our Cable company and switched to another provider which has been great. Well, prior to the install appt, I had been doing regular cleaning around the house, and since my monthly allergy shots had to be suspended during chemo, I must have aggravated my bronchial tubes right into bronchitis. Bam-I spent the next 5-6 days caughing up a storm. On Oct 3 I went in for my CBC which was good, but I asked to see a doctor, because I was a little concerned that I was getting stick. And with weakened immune system already in place, I didn't want to get into any full blown upper respiratory infection, etc. Well, low and behold he diagnosed me with Bronchitis and prescribed a 5 day antibiotics treatment. The next 5 days I continued to run a temp, and since he gave me 1 refill, I decided to take it another 5 days. Over the weekend (I was sick all week, knocked to the ground), I finally turned the page. All I kept thinking was 'I don't want to skip my treatment, I gotta knock this thing out before Thursday). So, I did all I could-rest, liquids, tea, cough syrup. A whole separate fight. It was not fun.... Since it seems we're chatting quite a bit about hair, my hair is thickest at the bottom of my neck in the back of my head...a little weird. My wife says when I bend forward too fast to have her kiss my head, it's like kissing a porcupine. I have hard stubble all over my head, but only a few millimeters. Then random hairs that are a bit longer. I've also lost some eyelashes, looks a little weird, because mine are kind of long, and thick, like a camel, my wife says, affectionatly, so you can really see where they are missing, LOL. So much love to you all-so many people experiencing such a range of emotion. I am always amazing how much this situation makes us all bounce from one extremity to another. I can't speak for anyone else, just as a serial planner, one of the hardest things for me has been to 'live one day at a time'. I was just telling a co-worker today, after I finally returned to work after the stupid bronchitis, that things like this do have a way of completely re-arranging your priorities in life. The truly important things are squeezed into focus, while the auxilliary things are suddenly minor and ousted to the periphery..... I hope the next round goes well for everyone-may this, too, pass.....",

Your mental state needs to be positive-it's all part of healing. And if something else is going on, get it checked out. They can see if there is anything else brewing, but definitely be an advocate for yourself and work with your doctors. If there is something else, have them check it out-it's why they are there. I hope you feel better soon, the negative 'mental suck' can get you, but don't let it win. Break down. Lose your marbles. Then gather them back up again, and look in the mirror to remind yourself that you can do this.  I lost both of my parents a few years ago to unrelated illnesses, and now my closest family lives in FL (I live in NJ). Well, my older brother in FL (14 years older) seems to be incapable of coping with 'my' illness.  When I first told him, he of course went into big brother mode and told me all would be ok, and how strong I was (while I was screaming at the top of my voice, crying on the day of my diagnosis, 6/19).  The other day while I was was on the phone he slipped up and said 'it helps us when we see you positive on Facebook'. I literally gasped. The reason I gasped is because I have been there for him through thick and thin, and now all of a sudden I can't rely on him for emotional support because he can't deal with the fact that his 'little sister' is dealing with this. Mind you, we are very close, but this has shattered his world, almost if not worse than mine. I don't use Facebook often, but with this situation have used it for quick updates, because it's too draining sometimes to send e-mails about the same thing to different people.  Completely understandable. I have worn a brave face for my closest friends, partly because I am a  strong person, and there is a core group of friends with whom I have communicated about all of this. They have the capacity for when I have @%^*(*@( days, but the last straw was when he said 'at this point it seems you may need some space'. What, talk about projection, LOL. I love to hear from him, but if I don't call him back on my worst days of my side effects (which I prefer not to speak to most people anyway), it automatically means I need space.  I sent him a birthday present in September 1 day after chemo, and he didn't even call me, because right before that we had that conversation when he said he thought I needed space. It's like he doesn't know what to do with me right now. My youngest nephew plays baseball for the University of FL, and his first official game is in Feb. As I love my nephews like my own kids (I don't yet have them), all I can think of is how much I hate the fact that I will probably be somewhat incapacitated from surgery around Thanksgiving (last chemo treatment is Nov 1), and can't be with my family. Of course, as I am a strong-willed person, I may also tape myself into a giant cooler with ice for my boob after surgery, and buy an extra chair on a Jetblue flight just to be with them. \"I am sorry Ma'am, you can't sit in the cooler and bust out the arm rests\". \"Why, I paid the extra 'sit in your own cooler' fee?\".  I've done crazier things than that.  Anyway, I digress-I was taken aback by even being in this situation (though my Nurse practioner and Oncologist keep saying how I should come back to some of the support groups and help encourage others to get through this strange boob apocalypse we're all navigating). So go figure, sometimes the people with the illness need to be double strong (like it's not hard enough to be 'regular strength' strong) in order to prop up those who are looking on. An odd psycholgical game we're playing indeed. Makes for a twisted reality show, or odd ball cartoon strip. Everyone who loves us is afraid for our lives. And yet, we have to keep reminding them that we're doing ok, even on days where are our eyes are blurry, food passed through us like a freight train OR a rock quarry, and steroids make us hyperactive like toddlers or superhumans, wide-eyed and manic. If you add up our selection of side effects alone, we'd be fit for a padded cell, if you looked in from the outside in (come on, some days I am nearly walking on all fours, and my eyes feel like they're under water, my brain like all I can process is 'Spongebob'). After this, I plan to take a vacation with my wife. Anywhere. That doesn't involve appointments, infusions, the incessant squeezing or discussing of my breasts and my lump, and where I'll eat whatever I want-except of course the foods that 'mimic estrogen and progesterone'. As you can tell, today is a 'sick of this bullshit' day. Some days I can't write the strangeness and humor I experience down fast enough. And some days, I STILL think....\"where am I, who am I, what planet am I on....what's that 'another' pink ribbon on the bag of chips at the grocery store to make me aware of breast cancer.  I am not bitter about the awareness, because I think the more women who can be helped by awareness, the better....but it makes it no less difficult to not only carry this b_tch in me whereever I go (not like I can take her out once in a while when I tired of her royal but hated lumpiness), but when every 4th commercial and gas station wants me to become even MORE aware (since I am obviously already all too aware)....well then, I am feeling like the steroid induced Hulk I see around my apartment some nights at 3 am......some days it's just too much, and inescapable. Emotional about all of this? Me? Nah.... And....tomorrow is another day...resetting. the clock. again.",

We were both immensely relieved to hear this, and I am now on my 3rd day of Tamoxifen. My Breast Surgeon said I am healing very well, and I do daily exercises recommended by American Cancer Society, for 'after surgery'. The day after Christmas I have my radiation consult and after that the simulation. I may be a candidate for the 3 (as opposed to the 6 week) week regimen, we will see. My wife is off through Jan 1'13, and I decided it would be a good time for me to finally take some days off for myself as well. It will be nice to have days off, and do a few day trips, without consideration of side effects or the other considerable toll that this entire ordeal can have on us emotionally and physically.

My nephew plays baseball for the Florida Gators and starts his season tomorrow (he's so stoked), and I've seen him develop all the way from T-Ball, traveling to see him for many, many years. A trip is in the cards in the next few months to see him pitch. Today is my 1st of 7 ''spot' radiation treatments to my surgical side where I had my lumpectomy 12/7. I have had 23 'whole breast' treatments, and my boob is ready for that to stop (I mean it's been through the mill already hasn't it?) My follicles are dancing tango in it, and I am red and irritated, but both doctors said that happens, and it's ok. I have also been on Tamoxifen since 12/18. At first I had hot flashes every half hour, and it was a little rough. I still wake up sometimes with night sweats, but other than that, it's been manageable. I, too have a great team that has been taking care of me at the Radiology/Oncology center, so they have helped me forget about my overall tiredness. I've been going to work through it all, and take walks with co-workers to get my active. I used to be an athlete, but of course, like many my metabolism has slowed down, as have my habits changed. As soon as my Rads are over, I will be using my rower and recumbent bike more regularly.  I've revamped my diet to incorporate a ton more veggies, fruit,and have cut back substantially on red meat and processed foods. While I can't control much in this nightmare of a saga, exercise and eating well are 2 things I can control. The community here has helped me through one of the hardest times of my entire life to date (I am 37 now)-my goodness what a crazy, varying journey it has been for us all-and it continues in our vigilance, learning and support.  It may always be a part of my life in one way or another (and...I am forever changed, in terms of perspective), but I have learned that your mental outlook has a lot to do with how you actually feel, and that treating your body, heart and soul like a temple (we only have 1), really is key.  Recently, I've started to educate myself more about Soy and Soy byproducts (talk about nebulous information on some stuff-ugh!), but overall, I am doing very well. And I never thought, during the days of chemo I'd say that, on some days. I hope everyone continues to get better, remain positive, and remember all things wonderful in this world, when days seem dark and scary. Every day remember where you've come from, and take care of yourselves! P.S.

We cried during parts of it, but I put on some 80's music and we ended up laughing through it. I thought I would completely freak out seeing myself in the mirror, but she did it in stages, where she first gave me a short hair cut, and then I saw that. After she cut and buzzed it, and it's kinda cute. I tried on some of her beanies, and they look cute. Had some hoop earings on (bought earlier today), and then tried on my hat with hair and wig. I won't be able to rock this hair cut out of the house (I have some bald spots, where it fell out, and am not sure I am THAT comfortable with it). My head is very airy now, especially when the fan goes by, LOL. It's definitely a little strange, because I had so much hair before, but I am just fine. The first ponytail we cut was 3 times thicker than my wife's hair. She just cut it per her own choice, to support me (not as short as me, but short). She originally saved her hair in case I wanted to have a 'hair halo' made of my own hair. I am watching a replay of the Women's Basketball game USA vs. Czech, and enjoying the fact that the 'hair drama' is now over. Going into 2nd treatment this week Thursday. Good luck everyone that is also going through this. A few days ago, I didn't think I'd ever smile about being 'bare' but it's ok now-you can get through this too. Try to keep a sense of humor...:)",

Good to take care of the rest of the fam (your doggies). How kind of you to give them a loving home! For the first time last week I outshed my cats....and I suspect my head will tickle them more now, than their whiskers have always tickled me, ha! I think we're all fortunate to share advice, tears and laughter with each other in this thread. Some days are definitely easier/harder than others. I'll be on my way shortly to watch the USA women hopefully kick some butt on Women's Soccer against Canada (yesterday, before I cut all my hair off, my wife and I decided to go outside and have some laughs kicking our soccer ball around...and today my feet and legs hurt a bit from not having done that in...ehem, a few years). But for once, in a while, 'pain' from living and laughing and not from any #^&**(@ meds:) And that made me smile. Funny (or not so funny) thing was....the last time there was a big match in soccer, I jumped up from the couch and in my cheering ecstasy broke my pinky toe on the bottom of our livingroom table. At the time, THAT was a pain in the a@@....today I think  back at that, and just shake my head. Perspective is a funny thing...but also makes you stronger, if you let it.

You have always been wonderful in this thread, sharing bits of advice and encouragement-thank you! I agree with what others have said-To anyone getting off-side comments or strange looks about the hair, I'd say this experience elicits all kinds of emotions from friends and acquaintences alike. Some people have a hard time dealing with this, because it inadvertently causes them to face their own fears, and or, they just don't know what to do when people look different, or know what the 'appropriate' thing is to say. Remember who you are inside, all you've accomplished, all you've contributed, and let that drive you. Having just shaved my hair down even further (it was just too itchy yesterday), and dealing with this myself, I know this can be very difficult. Embrace and love yourself, as you are still the same person (sans likely with a whole other appreciation for life and perspective on many things), as you were before this ordeal began. Dig deep to remember and reinforce the inner person you are and surround yourself with nothing but positivity. Don't take personal any oddities that come your way from people-after all 1000's and 1000's of women have come before us, and will very likely come after us. No one wants to take this journey, but how you take it will definitely define us all going forward. Whoever doesn't support you needs to be sidelined because negativity is the last thing we all need. Of course if the snarky or misplaced comments are coming from close family or friends, then perhaps a conversation is in order with those who can remotely handle it, since we don't want to isolate ourselves either. Look in the mirror and remember how strong YOU are (not your hair) for enduring not only the physical but emotional ups and downs. A funny story to share-before my 2nd treatment tomorrow, I was determined to feed a craving for Mexican food. 2 very good friends and I got together last night, and as I was on my way I received a text that they were running a bit late (typical of my best friend of 24 years, so I was not shocked at all,LOL).  Well, when I arrived at the restaurant sporting my new hat with hair, both of my friends had stopped at a wig shop right before, and were both wearing wigs to support me. While I cried at their genuine and funny show of support, I also laughed so hard that I could not stop-my best friend looked like a sexy porn star and my other long-time friend was totally rocking her wig, and loving it, too.  They are both HUGE jokers anyway, and amazing friends, but to say this was completely awesome would be an understatement. I am sharing this, because for every awkward, sad and discouraging moment that inadvertently arises throughout all of this, there are REAL moments of support, laughter (like when I swore my cat was looking at me weird yesterday, when in fact I tickled her with my stubbly head!), and encouragement. Sometimes in all of the craziness, you have to excavate to find and distill those moments, and remember that those are far more important in this journey than those laden with drama and negativity. But they are there. Good luck to everyone with your treatments if you have them soon. Stay strong and positive fellow July Chemo Hot chicks:)",

With the depression, try to do any small amount of the things you love to do, whatever those things may be. Studying Psych and going this situation, abandoning hobbies and or anything you love to do is a surefire way to spiral down. Easier said than done, especially when your hobbies may be physical, and you can't do it the week after Chemo treatment, but whatever you can do to stay phsically and mentally engaged with your friends, family and your own brain is helpful.  I can't speak for anyone else, in terms of what actually works, but I do as much housework as I can on my 'good' weeks, make plans with friends, and talk on the phone, play 'Words with Friends' with friends further away, stay in touch on Facebook and post little updates (mostly humorous, so my best friends can laugh,too), and follow one of the best pieces of advice I've read in all of this. Which is....try to keep the life you had before as much as you can-besides this, you are still you. Some days I feel sooooooo far away from myself, it's scary. Then I go to the mirror and say \"You won't get ME\", and work hard to get in touch with me-my favorite music, singing (which I love to do), nature programs, nature walks, and other things I enjoy.  So, as a movie nut, I see movies when I can (I also have a HUGE personal collection), and my wife and I are still making plans to attend any festivals we usually see. I won't put myself in physical danger by scheduling exhausting things 2 days after treatment, as I know I won't feel well. But, in a great and very funny book I read called 'How to Thrive on Chemo' or something like that, there were many, many funny anecdotes that now ring true, about living your life, despite of this, and not letting yourself be pyschologically debilitated, because it impedes healing. The Author talks about everything from all of our collective side effects, and that you have to choose to not just 'survive' the side effects but 'thrive' during this tough time period. I laughed through most of it (the random bodily functions cracked me up, but now that I am in the middle of it, are so true). I found it to be an uplifting read. I have been drinking 3 parts Gatorade and 1 parts water since Monday in my BPA free Nalgene bottle, and the Gatorade has given me an extra boost. I HATE drinking now, as it just feels so forced. But since dehydration can land you in the hospital and I already did that once (digestive issues), I am trying to avoid that. The Gatorade helps replenish other minerals and salts, so it makes sense why it's helping. I personally stick with the 'Fruit Punch'. As an added 'incentive' I've been picturing myself health, in High School (years ago, but a time when I was at my peak level of fitness, I'd say), doing a two handed backhand, or overhead smash. I used to drink Gatorade then, too. On tough days when I don't want to drink, I do heavy duty visualization. Last night I did my best sports caster voice. My wife was starting dinner and she had some much needed laughs (we're both exhaused from all of this, of course). We lift each other up when the other is down. This week, my VP is visiting because I'll be involved in an acquisition. First time with hat with hair in front of upper management. Will be a bit weird. But the good thing is, she is amazing and I have great respect for her. I am hoping there are no awkward moments, and my boss (she is his boss), has been very supportive. But still, you try to be strong and some moments, you just want to rip the wig and hat off and say 'For heaven's sakes, lets stop the niceties and cherades', LOL. 'Knitted Knockers', you're too funny. Animals definitely help with the healing. My cats have no idea, and when they come by me and purr, I smile, no matter what...  Mamabr-my heart goes out to you. The moments where I have to get into it with my wife for whatever reason (it doesn't happen often), I feel volnurable especially when being topless at home. I am so emotional, and I can be fine one minute and  not so fine later. Yesterday I came home, smiling from work. I thought I was fine, then I saw my wife who looked utterly exhausted. My worry for her own wellbeing effervessed to the surface in 1 second flat, and suddenly all I had wanted to say all week, while she herself prepares to go back to work after a very short break (she works a summer program,and is a pre-school teacher). And BAM, mini breakdown. 10 minutes then I was ok again-I just needed to get it out, as did she. I ran through the spectrum of emotions so quickly, I hyperventilated. We both ended up laughing, but it was good for us to get some release. At 19 or so, I saw my mom battle a tough disease (smoking related COPD and other things). It was very tough for me as she had always been strong as a horse, and now I was the care giver. For the next 12-15 years or so I watched her get worse, and took care of her,  and it was heartbreaking. I just wanted 'my mom back'.  Her emotions were heightened of course, and our relationship deteriorated. You are entitled to your fits. There will be some scars (physical, emotional),  no matter what you do, because how everyone processes things are different. She's afraid for you, and she also is trying to live her life, including her darn car. I am sure she misses her Mom (pre-chemo). I hope you guys can work things out, you sound like you are trying incredibly hard to protect her-I hope as a family you can stay strong together, and emerge even stronger after this is done. Take care of yourself & hugs to you-sauce sounds good, good for you for continuing routine things like cooking, when you can! Nat-\"This is my good week\" should be a bumper sticker. I use this all of the time-especially when I have to explain again and again, how I am 'Roidzilla' the previous week (steroids make me ridiculously hungry), and then the week before the next lovely infusion, is my good week. Today (my last day  before my next chair stint), I am at work taking a break to pop in, and like someone mentioned I am experiencing some 'anticipatory anxiety' as well.  I know exactly why it's happening and mentally negotiating with my rational self, to keep it at bay. But I'd rather be in Bora Bora than be in that chair, just because I know that I will be emotionally and physically spent days after. I wish they could fit this whole awful experience in one injection right into the damn tumor and be done. But alas, it needs to run through systemically, happy joy joy! March on soldiers, round through round, hang on to your sanity, and kick @ss. After the dust settles after our periodic craziness(sometimes a few times per day), we march on through another round of filling pill boxes, refilling prescriptions, doctor's visits, stress, worry and...standing back up again, after unbuckling the seatbelts of the roller coaster. Good luck everyone-try to keep 'you' on the radar and in your brain, even if a little 'foggy' at times!",

But they all understanding when I come undone once in a while. I am on 'intermittent' disability. When I was first diagnosed (6/19), I filed the paperwork once my Onc told me what regimen I'd be on (TAC), and how often, and what my side effects would be, etc. I decided to try to be out of work the day of my treatment (Thurday) and the day of my Neulasta shot (Friday), and then the whole following work week and weekend. Then I would return to work through the next Wednesday, until the fun started all over again. My side effects have been dragging a bit, meaning initially (1st treatment), I was hit HARD with fatigue and mental fog, etc for about 4-5 days, but could return to work on Monday with a good recuperation time in between. Now (treatment # 3 and going into # 4 this week), my side effects are cumulative, as my Onc, Nurse Practioner and Breast Surgeon cautioned me of. So by Saturday and Sunday before work, I am a bit draggy. However, work and the 3rd party company have my schedule, and I call the day before I go out, and the day before I go back in, just to confirm we're on track. It has worked well so far, and I have remained mentally sharp because of it. In addition, I also subscribe to lumosity.com-a site that lets you practice mental sharpness, memory, etc. In my own personal way, it was my way of counteracting  some of the things that were happening to my brain. Like many,I have a lot of responsibility at work, and a lot of other projects going on in my personal life. So though I can't be sure what the future holds with lasting effects of all of this, I still do all I can to stay me, as much as me. Haha, on the Tennis,  I was one Scholar Athlete of the year, so since my confidence has been somewhat annihilated throughout all of this, I decided I was going to 'show my wife who's boss' in one arena, where I used to undoubtedly excel-a silly little mental game I was playing with myself to boost my self-esteem and make me smile. These small things and pockets of laughter are getting us both through some hard days....but they are also reminders, that life existss outside of 'this'. Speaking of weird things happening at the end of the cycle (and beginning of next)....I have really bad allergies (indoor and outdoor), and before this thing happened, I was getting monthly allergy shots. As part of the chemo, I take Allegra to counteract the bone pain. Perhaps my fall allergies are kicking up, but I feel like I belong in a 'dry eyes' commercial. LMAO-I think tonight I will attempt to put some drops in my peepers....",

The Allegra I take before my Neulasta shot helps with that bone pain issue, but I am not sure if the Taxotere pain is different or if they are all blending together since I get 3 meds at once, or if I am not actually experiencing Taxotere pain at all, but rather bone pain from Neulasta.

I had a 2nd MRI the day before Thanksiving (wonderful, right?), and saw my breast surgeon this week Wed. She confirmed that the tumor had shrunk enough for her to do a lumpectomy. I was glad to hear that, and not so glad to hear about the lymph node mapping test I have to do the morning up, to determine sentinel and possibly other nodes affected. Like many, I am concerned about lympedema. I had planned to lose some weight after this chemo and surgery stage, and am left handed (my left breast has the bc), and now I am afraid of doing anything after surgery with that arm. I have a sedentary job, and since being an athlete earlier in my life put on a few pounds. Since that is a risk factor for bc, I am trying to do all I can to help prevent a recurrence. The surgery doesn't scare me as much as the lymph node thing.... Susan-I am sorry to hear about the change in treatment/bump in surgery-hopefully at least it helps you get rid of some of it earlier.

Have been so grateful for all of the tips in these forums, and my partner and I are getting ready for treatment # 1. Chemo Edu yesterday with fantastic Nurse. A little worried about the 'flu' symptoms and bone pain, although I know worse can happen. Finally went to wig/accessories shop yesterday after chemo edu. Crazy how fast this all happens, but I am getting used to having to let my dark mane go, so that's one step closer.....hoping I get through ok. We have lots of support and great tips,including all of you. Still sometimes in shock.....Sounds like many of you are weathering the storm relatively well...considering!",

I still need to take steroids today (one more for the night) and then 2 more days (tomorrow and Sunday). I am picturing myself floating high above our town, like the Marshmellow man on strings...my feet are elevated. I had been taking Allegra 180 for allergies previously, so my doc recommended I take it before Neulasta shot today. Shot hurt a bit in arm (I know they could have given it to me elsewhere, but the other locations sounded even less exciting). No bone pain thus far, and I am asked to keep taking Allergy med for a few days to attempt to minimize any bone pain that could otherwise set in. I am a little tired, but I don't think true 'fatigue' has knocked on the door just yet. Bracing myself for tomorrow, to see what else pops up...it's like \"Mysteries of the Unknown\"..... I fully expect to have floated to the top of our bedroom in the middle of the night....",

Yesterday was my last day of steroids and I am relieved as they made my ankles swell and I was very jittery. However, I have found tricking my water with slicing any kind of fresh fruit, lemon slices, and lacing in some Getorade, low sugar apple juice, or white grape juice has really helped me get more hydration. I just make pitchers of it with ice, or let it get it warm a bit.  Today (day 4) I feel achy and very tired (a bit weird as I am 36 and ordinarily very active), but eating small meals with protein, carbs and as much nutrious food as possible has really helped me. In addition, my Allegra is keeping the bone pain at bay.  Once in a while I just put on my MP3 player and take a few walks around the house, just to get movement-and only for a few minutes. Also, doing some memory exercises and other 'brain' intensive things, to the extend that you can, really helps me. I am pretty wiped out physically, but trying to stay positive-good luck everyone-we can do this-see the big picture and stay positive!",

(Every 2 weeks?). I am on an 'every 3 week' schedule. Good luck with your next treatment.  I am getting closer to getting over my initial hair loss shock. I have always a thick dark mane of hair, which I've always had, so my 'hair falling out' has been traumatic for me, as I posted over the last few days (had pretty bad meltdown yesterday). Today I got a call from the awesome woman (Lisa) who opened an account with a John Renau wig source for me at her own offering (I apparently have a 'large' head, so I had to start searching by size, and came across  www.headcovers.com/12537/large... ).  And it's cheaper than pictured, and insurance will pay most if not all, so I am happy. So, I chose the dark, dark brown option with a bit of light in it, and my wig was delivered to the 'Wellness Boutique' at the center where I am being treated. All day at work, everytime I went to adjust my scrunchy, strands and strands of hair kept coming out. I didn't cry today at my desk at least,  but it was annoying and still shocking. When I was telling my co-workers that I was on my way to pick up my 'new hair', I managed to squeeze out a laugh, and of course some cries. They were all very supportive as they have been, and told me I probably would look 'hot'. Well, after the nightmare that this has been, it was nice to hear that, because right about now, I feel everything but (though my wife always does, and couldn't make me feel sexier every day if she tried!). So I went and they put it on me, and the joke was, that despite how much hair I lost over the last few days, the fact that I have to much hair to begin with was making it hard to fit the wig on my head. Obviously that was a source of mixed emotions for me (Damn cancer, you're not getting my hair as 'fast' as you want!), and ('I am not here not there, have my hair under a wig'). But, the good news was it actually looks very good (and I don't really go around tooting my own horn, especially not right now), and I am relieved and happy that it looks a lot like 'me'. I really needed that (some days, I couldn't feel further from 'me' as many of us have experienced), and the staff at the store said I made their day, because I looked genuinely happy. I have tried wigs on in the last few weeks, and I looked like I was in disguise-funny conceptually but not in practice. I initially left disappointed and scared I was going to look strange for months.  So, whew that part was over (I was afraid it would look aweful). I went home, in the bathroom, told my wife (with whom I have been with since 1999), that I had to go put my new hair on, but I wanted it to look nice). Well eventhough I've never been super 'girly' in terms of obsessing over my looks (I was a former athlete, and generally am a t-shirt and jeans girl), I still suddenly was having fun with it. Put it on...made a few sexy faces in the mirror, and then proceeded to show her. It looks great, natural and it will be fun to wear Fedora hats and baseball caps. My stylist can even cut it a bit shorter(I generally wear my heair shoulder length and blowdried pin straight, eventhough my natural hair has a slight wave in it). So for a sec I was dress up Barbie, and that was ok. I suddenly felt empowered and smiling ear to ear. Wife loves the wig, but most importantly I feel I can 'rock this wig'. I never thought I'd ever say this, but as fast as the hair crisis came on unexpectedly, I'll be fine. Can't wait to get my sleeping caps, and I may even get another wig to play. I may even take some black and white pics, classic style rocking my 'new hair'. Just wanted to share this because just 24 hours ago I was devastated about my literal 'unraveling'. We all have to at least try to feel physically comfortable through these treatments. It's hard to see a blatant reminder of the cancer in you, as a physical manifestation. All of the amazing strength and sharing here, my friends' and family's support, and my co-workers' boost today reminded me that I am beautiful I am inside and out. And hopefully my little 'dress up' tale with its smiles and tears will help someone else lurking or struggling with this right now....wish you all a comfy, positive and mild side effect evening and weekend . ",

Well of course it will hurt. I am not sure how many nodes they'll need to remove, but I am just trying to do what I can. Any advice/other resources are appreciated.

My port will likely be put in next week(I have no veins to speak of,so my Onc thought it made more sense). A little nervous about them cutting my neck (just diagnosed 6/19, so I've been in the familiar whirlwind of tests,etc since then. A bit on the anxious side, so bear with me:) ). My 1st TAC treatment is scheduled for 7/19. We are doing Neo in hopes of shrinking tumor. I am 36 and would like to conserve my left breast if possible (no signs of disease in right breast), but I am starting to make friends with idea of the Mastectomy in case it is not possible. I've come a long way, since thinking my 'lump' was scar tissue from being clocked in the boob while folding laundry one day. There were 2 other small areas on an MRI that my breast surgeon ordered, which were to be biopsied with Ultrasound guidance. However,they didn't manifest. Radiologist felt they were likely lobules, and or enlarged lymphones which were not necessarily a cause for worry. All was discussed with breast surgeon by him right after Utrasound, so we'll see if she wants to squeeze in more tests prior to Chemo. Previous Cat Scans-Pelvic, Abdomen, Chest, and Bone scan all clear, which was a relief. Muga=66.  So, now my actual road to recovery starts on 7/19. Like many, I've spent much time asking questions, learning, etc from my 2 fantastic doctors, and all of you, and at other sites. I am nervous about starting treatment, given side effects, but have been remaining very positive, with steady support system, including my partner of 13 years, behind me. I've dubbed myself 'Xena' for this journey, which fits my personality and spirit:) ",
