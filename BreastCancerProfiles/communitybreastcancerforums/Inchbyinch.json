I currently have big time fat necrosis in in cancer related side (radiated in 2007). So I am having my consult with PS to remove necrosis and at the same time remove the dogears. When I had my BMX, I had fat injected under the skin to try to make a small mound look. I am going to get that all sucked out at the same time. It looks weird because the previously radiated side with the necrosis is all gathered up, while the prophylactic side is droopy fat. (Already have plenty of, thank you very much). Here's my questions: 1) Of those of you who have had dogear revision, was it paid for by insurance? 2) Also, any advice on when I ask PS to remove the fat under the skin (I would like a flat look)? Should I still spare the skin or have everything I can removed? I want it to be easier to feel possible tumors in chest wall easily but want to avoid being concave.

Two issues with that: 1) I also read on that thread that some women were having trouble with it feeling too tight/taught. Is it possible to be too flat and then ending up with irreversible tightness? 2) 10 year old boy is great If you have a tummy of a 10 year old boy. I do not feel self conscious about no reconstruction, but I have felt really self-conscious about my belly. I try to tell myself I'm alive with a recurrence and not to care, but it's easier said than done",

I felt more ready. He asked if I was sure that I wasn't going to want reconstruction down the line. I said that I didn't want it 2 years ago and I've had more time to think about it. And may I please have the \"10 year old boy special\"? So the flabby skin and \"bra rolls\" (I liked that's what he called them) are coming off",
