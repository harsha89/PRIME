I'm having Bilateral Mastectomy, No Reconstruction on August 8,2017.  I cannot have radiation and may not be able to have Chemo due to my autoimmune disease. MO is going to wait and see how my body handles surgery.  Thank you MsMisha and Toughcookie for your updates after surgery. Msmisha, you mentioned a new type of dye for the Sentinel lymph node biopsy that was pain free.  My surgeon warned me that it was going to be painful. Now I am worried that I'm not getting the latest and greatest Medical care.  Well, I'm just worried about everything.   I live alone.  I have no one to help after surgery.  So, my question to post op's - if I did find someone to come over a few times, what would I need them the most for, and when should they be with me? I'm talking a few hours here and there at the most.  Thank you everyone - details please.  Sorry about the format - I find it confusing.  Not sure if my profile came thru, so I will post briefly :      Dx June 26, 2017, IDC Left, 3.7cm, Stage IIb (?) grade 2, ER+/PR+/HER2-    Toughcookie, you are very brave.  ",

My Doctor told me not to worry about it, which means there is northing that can be done. Next visit is Wed 6th - hopefully Left drain can be removed. I was told I had to below 30ML for 2 days.  Besides the Protruding tube and pain under the armpits, and the barbwire wrapped around my chest, and the severe fatigue, at least I've stopped crying every time I change my binder/bandages.  I just look surprised that my breast are gone and I look like a monster.   Everyone seems so brave.  MrsWhinnie I just read your post about your drainage tubes and your family support.  Glad to hear your able to be up and about.  I think there are only a few of us that had surgery first then we are tackling the Chemo/Hormone Therapy and Maybe Radiation afterwards.  Most had Surgery afterwards.  I'll be reading \"Chemo In Aug\" next week, or perhaps a new group will start \"See You In September\"  Hope WellWhishes you feel better, and sorry to hear LisaBS you were in hospital.  Everyone take care",

Then again said just the Herceptin and Radiation might be enough.  Then mentioned Carboplatin instead of Cytoxan.  I was so confused I needed a chart.    I asked if I just had Herceptin for the HER2, if that would help, Dr answered Yes.  No mention of anti-estrogen pill in this mix.  I asked if I could drive myself if I took Chemo, and answered yes.  If the SE were bad enough you could not drive, then we would stop the Chemo.  MRSWinnie, I'm so sorry you are HER2+/  I found out after 4 tests, and the thought of having IV infusions every 3 weeks for an entire year was overwhelming.   Didn't you say you had issues with your drain tubes because you were so small?  I can't remember if it was you or not - someone did and I have the same problem - protruding tubes so I am really worried about a port.  But of course, my Dr when asked, assured me a port would not hurt and I really didn't have to have one.    ?????????????????  I feel the same as you MRSWhinnie.   Why go thru more when they got all the 'crap' out in surgery. My Pet Scan is Clean.  Yeah Me,  Maybe my RO appointment tomorrow will shed some light, but probably just make it more confusing.  Any thoughts which Chemo treatment is less invasive? : Cytoxan or Carboplatin // Taxotere or Taxol ?  And one more question :  What is the chemo treatment \"AC\" ?    Well, one more question - I want to know how SheLabela is getting along with your Proton radiation?  ",

I felt ok the first 3 days - little heavy and bloated, the day 4 after the pre-meds and IV stuff to help wore off - I started feeling yucky.  Constipation/Diarrhea and mouth sores were my biggest problems.  Best of Luck!  SDK8 - beautiful picture.  Do i See a pool in back - I'll bet your husky loves that in the heat of LAS!  I used to have 2 Keeshounds.   Mom -Tina, Glad you had a good day back at work.  Can you wear a scrub cap when your hair falls out?  Then nobody really would ever know!   I think I will too start taking Claritin all the time (My Mom does for her allergies) Maybe it will help stop my never ending dripping nose.

Going to try the eye bro Pencil kit and ordered Bliss Kiss Simply Pure Cuticle nail oil from amazon - since my cuticles are so brittle and painful.  No Itching down under. yet.  but 'something' doesn't feel right.  I think I'll buy some Monistate to add to my arsenal.  Later - Take care! rj  ",

(I'm 59)  (attacks the muscle tissues) My Rheumatologist had warned me that that I had a high risk of Cancer with this. So, I've been dealing with this horrible disease, and the loss of my job and friends for quite some time. (friends stop asking me to go out when I always said I couldn't because I didn't feel good)  Most of the time the SE's - I don't know if they are from my Diseases or from Chemo.  Both are just about the same - (Except the BIG D)  I'm not afraid or worried of dying, or reoccurrence.  I've had a wonderful life full of friends and travel.  I just want to feel well enough to finish renovating my 'little house' and try to make my Mom (who has Dementia) as comfortable as possible.  I live on a 50 acre non-working farm that my parents turned into a forest preserve with trails and bridges.  There is always something to do.  I want to mention one thing that really helped me thru this - I was terrified because I lived alone, and I have a \"do not call 911 Policy\".  The Social worker at the Cancer Center assigned me a \"Cancer Buddy\" someone that had went thru Cancer before and wanted to pay if forward.  She has been a life savor.  She checks on me once a day via text, she insisted on taking me to the hospital when I hesitated, and has become a wonderful friend.  Made all the difference in the world.  Mom4 - i'll have to look up the freebie site, though I don't want to travel again.  Maybe they will have something close to home.  I traveled and moved for 30 years.  I'm tired!  1950-1952 - Do you have a port?  When I used to get IVIG infusions every week, toward the end the IV started really hurting and the heat pack would help.  I'm so glad I got a port.  Everyone told me it wasn't a big deal, and they were 100% right.  I forget I have it until I hit it accidently.   It sounds like your WBC really went low at 2.8.  Did you feel bad?  Could you tell?  Do you take Neulasta?  Take care - Everyone have a safe New Years - I got a bottle of champagne - probably can only tolerate a sip, but it will to be to wash 2017 out of my life!   ",

Claritin for bone pain, (which isn't helping) I have the Neulasta Pod go off day #2.   I take Acyclovir to keep shingles at bay, and Zofran 8mg on hand - but have not used it. Plus Omerprazole, Tums, Pepto Bismal, Gax X and Maralax.  Don't dare take Imodium.  Constipation a HUGE issue.   A lot of stomach issues but no Nausea.

No Lifting or bands- nails still strong. I just rub Vit E into my scars and into my nails 2-3 times a day.  Hope99 - I too had the worse time during the last 2 chemo treatments.  Are you HER2+?  I can't give any imput on surgery - I choose to have DBL mastectomy and NO reconstruction.  I'm remaining flat.

I'm going to add a few other things that I've read about.  (I feel like I have an entire drugstore in my closet)  I have been reading and I have found out Everybody Has Different Side Effects. You just never know how your body will react.  - Plastic silverware - metal taste at times  - soft toothbrushes  - Smooth Move Tea for constipation (Target)  - satin like pillow cases when/if you loose your hair - Sennekot - constipation - HopeBC mentioned Baking Soda/Salt/Water - I heard to have Dixie cups and pre-made solution and swish at least 8 times a day.  - Nose bleeds - use Arya Nose Gel and get a Humidifier     My MO has already given me a list of what I will pick up at the drugstore prior to Chemo:     Rx Dexamethasone (steroids)      Rx Zofran & Compazine for Nausea      Rx Lorazepam (anxiety)      OTC: Imodium AD & Claritin - (for neuropathy) I realize I'm going overboard, but I live alone and have no one to go run to the drugstore if I get a Side Effect I wasn't prepared for.  As Trdew said 'expect the worst and be pleasantly surprised if its not'      Good Luck Trdew, Lisette27, Corduroy and Timesliketh - I hope your 1st Chemo goes well.  ",

Ha. (just for the eyebrow stuff)    SO far I feel ok.. But its only day 2 ........Let me rest, and I'll get back and see how everyone else faired. I feel so much Better Mood wise now that DAY #! is over !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The anticipation was killing me.  Done!   ",

Day  2 Neulasta pod went off - hardly any bone pain (Disclaimer : I already have bone, Muscle, Joint pain from my Auto Immune Disease - it just wasn't any worse than normal pain)  Day 4- CONSTIPATED & Bloated, and cramping.  No Nausea. (Taking Compozine and Ativan regardless) Day 5 - I thought I was going to die from Constipation - but didn't. Relief that afternoon after taking  EVERYTHING. (Colace, Smooth Moves Tea, Fiber Pills, Prunes and Maralax)  Day 5 - Calcium Deposits on my finger tips - very painful (Calcinoisis) Severe Diarrhea.  Day 6 - I feel Ok - EXCEPT  SEVERE MOUTH SORES.  I have been swishing with Baking Soda/Salt concoction and Biaotine dozen times a day from day one.  I thought I would escape this one.     Felt Like A dozen Tiny Razor blades cutting inside of my mouth - Sores on the insides/outside of my lips - I couldn't eat or talk. I was sucking on pop cycles, icecubes, lozenges and swishing and gargling.   NOTHING HELPED> kept getting worse. Day 8 - Huge Lump on side of face inside mouth. (Plus sores and \"cuts\" getting worse)            - I get a Jury Summons Letter !            - Trying to balance BIG C and BIG D Day 9 - Called for Help about Mouth :  MARY's MAGIC MOUTHWASH - Thank God.  Within 24 hours I got relief.  It has Lidocain and Anitbiotics in it.   CVS made it up.  Cost with Insurance $50 (Shhhhhh - I would have paid double)  Day 10 - Nose is running - just pouring.  All Mouth Sores are healing.  Day 11 - I FEEL GOOD.  I have so  much energy.  WHAT is up with that? Mouth sores are just about gone.     I have a lot of questions/comments to address - but I'll do that in next post - this is a little lengthy!  take care everyone ! rj",

If one doesn't work, try another.  (of course there are side effects to the anti-nausea meds ) Just be sure to communicate with your MO or RN.  Just an example : Compazine - It takes away the nausea (besure to take your Rx BEFORE you get sick - don't play catch up) and I have zero SE's with it, but others say it makes them sleepy or tired. Everyone is different.  Best of Luck! I went out and bought Truman boots - (thx 1950-1952) and took a long walk at 4 degrees. Refreshing. Dropped in on a friend (making sure they didn't have a temp :) And Blair, you are absolutely right.  If I hadn't went out today, my Jeep would have not started with being zero all week.  Yes, klvans, getting some fresh air did the trick.  I cannot wait till I get my Den finished.  It has both South and West Sun Exposure and French doors to the East.  Bright and Sunny, just what the DR ordered.  Great little video Emalyn.  I would have to have lessons.   Meow- you look great in bright colors! I was given a long flowy tassel scarf I'll have to wear in springtime - I'll look it up on YouTube.   Orange Daisy - I think after next chemo I will make the effort to go in to get my labs.  I have been wondering how everyone knew when their WBC were low or not to go out.  You go inbetween treatments to get labwork.  I see this now.   Take care all! ",

She's 89, so no surgery for her.  SHe was complaining her lower back was hurting & after a week they finally took her to the Hospital for an MRI because they thought it was her Kydneys or something - but never thought it was a broken back.  Magari - we are just about the same treatments - I am glad you have some energy to go to a concert and have some fun.

Versed was useless.  I could really feel the surgery.     Meowmm65 - I see that we are on same treatment - and I'll be starting Nov 28. How is your port today?  Hope it improved. Did your port look like this 6 hours after surgery?    I'll be looking forward to sharing our SE's (What SE's? - ha) My MO said I won't have any.  Ok - I'll try to believe.      OrangeDaisy - I'll be taking Taxotere - That's alarming that they said it was NOT Neulasta. I think the general notion was bone pain was primarily from Neulasta ?? Or maybe not.  I am on daily steroids (for auto immune disease) I wonder if that will help prevent or won't help at all. I plan to take Claritin.       Hi Nonahope - I don't have children - Hats off to all of you who do. Amazing strong women!  Corduroy - Sorry your had a reaction to Emend.  I'll bet you'll Rock that wig!       ",

Unfortunately, in my case, people offer to help, but when it comes right down to it, they are too busy. I was actually told by a relative 'the only time you call is when you need something' so I guess its my fault.  I got myself into this mess,  I'll dig myself out.  Thanks for the encouragement everyone - ",

Everyone is Different.  Remember to swish swish swish with Baking Soda & Salt and Biotine!  Magari - we have the same chemo and started almost together.  I had the BIG D for a few days.  Ugh.

Went ahead with chemo treatment #4 without issues.  Seems to be getting shorted - tolerating well enough to speed up dosage I guess. Just kicks butt afterwards.      I'll catch up with all your posts after a nice long nap.   Take care. ",

(#4)  Feels like I tried to open a jar with ridges and got road burn on the tips.  Mouth sores have started again.  I was told Iron ( I am taking Iron and Potassium from MO) makes one constipated - but of course its just the opposite for me - I have Diarrhea. (weird metabolism I have)   Now that I remember, I forgot to munch on ice - maybe that's why I got mouth sores this time.    No Energy, and No word regarding results of my MRI.  I guess no news is good news.   And BRUISING.  Oh My Goodness - my legs are covered in bruises.  I look like I've been in a car accident. And AGE SPOTS.  Never had them before all over hands, arms and legs.  Meow - Your scarfs look so much better than my beanies.  I'll have to give it a try.  Hope99 - yes, I have stomach pains every once in a while.  Not nausea, some acid reflux. A full uncomfortable achy feeling. Like I've ate too much.  But nothing worrisome. Pepto Bismal works for me for anything tummy related. Sometimes I think its my Ulcer flaring up again.    Take care everyone - You all are life savers...... rj",

When looking it up it says for bladder control (which I can use) says nothing about hot flashes.  I'll have to check with my urologist before taking.  Hope everyone gets thru the snow storm tomorrow safely.  Rj",

I'm so sorry you had that for 8 days.  What did your DR's say about that?  2.  Neulasta injection.  Did you have your WBC tested before you were given the shot? How did they know you had low WBC counts? Or did they just assume with the combo your taking?  (I was told I would have to come in between day 7-10 for lab work and not be given Neulasta unless WBC count was low)   One would think there would be a home test for that - like a pin prick of the finger for diabetes test.  I take Prednisone on a daily basis - hopefully I won't have any additional rashes.  And my dog Truman takes Benadryl, I'll borrow his. :)   so happy for you Orangedaisy -that there was no nausea.  I hate that feeling.   I have saline nasal spray and gel (thanks Paulette) and I will add Epson Salt, just in case.  My freezer is small, so mostly soups it will be.

Helped my Lower back pain - using Ice.  Nice Friend you have - I'm sure she was more than willing/wanting to help.   Slight headache - might be from the Zofran - I've only taken it once.  You girls take care, be safe, move slowly, crawl if you have to. ",
