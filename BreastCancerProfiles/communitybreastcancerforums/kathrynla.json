I originally was looking at a lumpectomy with radiation (although I really hated the thought of the radiation - since it does make future reconstruction work, if you need it, less successful and weakens the bones.) But I didn't think I had much choice. Then I got my BRCA results back in early December and I was positive for BRCA2...and that was a game changer. In a way it was a strange relief -- since now I was going to do a double mastectomy and no radiation. Also, it would greatly decrease the chances of more cancer in my breast. The last few weeks have been a series of meetings, phone calls, posts and obsessive internet browsing on all reconstruction issues.Â  I thought I was going to go with nipple sparing surgery, implants and alloderm near my home in LA. But over Christmas my mother talked to a Dr who strongly recommended NOLA and their methods of using natural tissue. I am still on the fence but am flying to New Orleans on Monday to meet with one of the docs and see how that feels. At this point I am starting to want to put the research behind me and get moving with the next step (this is definitely a sign of acceptance and I can tell it is a integral part of this process.) So hang in there and make sure you feel that you are making the right choice for yourself. Good luck.",
