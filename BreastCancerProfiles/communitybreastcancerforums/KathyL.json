I never should've even had BC!  I've looked up some great things on UPenn's website: www.oncolink.com. They are cutting edge with BC research. I'd also recommend she talk with her onc or a genetic couselor about getting BRCA testing.  This may help her in her decision regarding prophylactic double mastectomy.  Oncotype testing is also something to talk with her oncologist about since she's ER/PR+; it can give you some ideas about recurrence rates and treatment options. Lastly, take your time and ask all your questions.  Make the choice that's right her for her and your family so that she won't look back with any regrets.  There are sooo many options out there it can be mind boggling, and everyone is different with BC. I am 37 (DX at 36 last August with stage 1a).  I was told originally I did not need chemo, but after a second opinion at UPenn I got some additional info that led me to do chemo.  I did taxotere/cytoxan for 4 rounds every 3 weeks; just finished it on 3/19.  I also received herceptin (for HER2+ BC) and will continue this for a full year.  Chemo is no fun, but it's do-able.  There is no way, even with my tiny (4mm) BC that I'd change what I did.  I'm too young, with children, to not do everything possible now to avoid BC again. Best of luck on this journey.  Warm wishes of success to your wife.",

You are correct in thinking the cancer has been present for years, so waiting a few more weeks should not do much in the grand scheme of cancer cells.  But I'm not sure what effect the IVF hormones will have on her type of cancer.  Many women harvest eggs before chemo though, so your onc should be able to answer that question.",

So, what I can pass on...  you can do this, and having a group to commiserate with will be extremely helpful to you-- so stick together.  Everyone is different in their reaction to chemo-- but no one that I know of gets through without NO side effects.  You will probably be tired a lot, you may have aches and pains, you probably won't throw up (the meds they use these days are fabulous).  Every drug they use seems to have another drug to counteract problems-- you'll have a mini-pharmacy in your house!  And, yes, you'll probably lose your hair-- about 12-20 days after your first treatment seems to be the average.  It's not as bad as you'd think though.  A lot like to take charge and cut it short beforehand, or shave it off right when they notice it starting to come out.  You will most likely have a few good days between treatments, even with the every 2 week regimens.  But the thing to remember is that everyone is different.  And each round may be different. So, stock up on things ahead of time (food; drinks; books/entertainment; medicines for heartburn, constipation, sleep, pain), do something to help you relax before the first round, and keep a journal.  This will help you learn for the subsequent rounds, and also help you remember when certain SEs occur.  The anticipation really is worse than the actual first infusion.  Remember to ask for and take help when it's offered.  There are no medals for being a chemo martyr!  And you'll be tired-- how much, it's hard to say.  Have friends make meals, watch your kids, go to chemo treatments with you (sometimes they are very long-- most of mine took 5-6 hrs.), garden, clean, cook-- anything!  There were days when all I could do was get out of bed to the sofa, others I was feeling great and could exercise, cook, play with the kids.  Emotionally-- it's still a roller coaster ride.  Just remember feeling \"blue\" is normal, but to talk about it instead of shut everyone out.  Financially-- get your ducks in a row beforehand if you can. The stress of money makes it all worse.  Most caner centers will have a social worker or someone who can help you deal with this aspect.  I was afraid we'd lose our house with me out of work for so long (even with the insurance)-- we got some great, free advice from my center. For the mom that posted-- my mother was my absolute best help.  She came to my house (she lives 2 hrs. away) for each round and stayed for about 4-5 days each time to help cook, keep me company and get me to appointments (you may not be able to drive depending on what type of chemo/pre-meds you get), and help with the kids.  B/C she was there, my husband could go to work and did not have to take time off.  My kids' preschool also made meals for us that we could freeze and then pull out when we needed them-- huge help! Best of luck to you all on your journeys!  I hope some of this was helpful.  You can PM me anytime with questions, or come check out the Jan. 2008 thread for tips.",

As for the comments/questions about recon.  I had the expander (hated it), but the exchange was a breeze.  I was so happy to get that damn coconut-shell-of-an-expander out I just about skipped down the hall to the OR.  I had both new boobs in and \"topped\" by Xmas that year (think \"all I want for Xmas is my two new boobs!).  I neede nothing other than Tylenol after the exhange.   And I was awake for the nipples and tattooing... it's not as bad as that sounds, I really didn't feel a thing.  My PS did an augmentation on the opposite side of my mx, which wasn't bad either.  I remember that the hardest part was the drain.  Now that thing hurt!  I just counted down the days until it could come out and learned how to handle it carefully.    And lastly, I get MRIs every year for 5 years, mainly b/c of my age at dx (36) and the fact that I have dense breasts which makes mammos not as accurate.  I have to fight my insurance co each year b/c they deny payment, stating MRIs are \"not medically necessary\"... I'd like for them to go thru what we've all done and see if they still think that!  But so far I've had the first two covered after my surgeon fights back.  Bless her!  I hate the MRIs b/c I'm so claustrophobic, but Xanax has helped.  And I have had one biopsy since my dx for a suspiscious area which turned out to be  B9, but I'd rather go through that than not be checking.",

SIS Kimberly:  I have my finger crossed that chemo won't be postponed due to the infected boobie. Julie:  Glad to hear that earthquake in IL did not damage your home.  Hope you can rest without worry for the next few days as the chemo fog descends.  Just think... last time!!  Ahhhh! Therese:  Sounds like you had some wild weather, too, this weekend.  Glad you're safe.  Hope ds is feeling better now-strep is no fun.  Good thing it responds quickly to abx. Yea on the scheduled exchange surgery!  Next up will be some bra shopping for you-that was so much fun.  I'll let you know how my nipple surgery goes-it sounds fairly easy-so maybe you wouldn't have to wait long to do it. BTW, I loved your \"cherries on top\" reference-- LOL!  Also glad to hear your negative BRCA results-one less worry or decision to make.  And yes, I agree-time seems to fly now post-chemo.  It's crazy... I'm about 3 weeks behind you in the hair growing... so can you still see your scalp, or is it getting thicker now? Carol:  Sorry to hear about ds's infection.  At least you/he caught it before it got worse (and I've seen it worse).  Bonus on the massages!!  Hope you enjoy them. Dana:  Sounds like you've had a rough week.  Go easy on yourself-a lot of the things you're experiencing (wt. gain, higher BP, chemopause) will resolve later on.  Do you get a summer break from school?  I agree with Cathy-CA about asking for help from your instructors BTW.  Hang in there!  When will you find out your liver results?? Paula:  You had an action-packed weekend from the sounds of it!  Congrats to ds on his 1st homer!  Glad you're enjoying Wendi's book.  She was pretty amazing. The eyelash thing sucks-like the last \"gotcha\" from chemo.  I hear many people lose them afterwards like this.  And, my THO will only be unilateral now (my right side is still \"real\" but augmented)-won't that look delightful? Cathy-CA:  Sorry to hear about your rough week also.  I'm sure it's doubly hard losing someone to cancer these days.  My sympathy to you.  (((Hugs))) D1:  Hope you had a good weekend.  Try Word when you get back-it really does make things much easier (that SIS Kimberly is such a genius...) Tina:  What a great surprise from your boss.  And your co-workers are just amazing for helping you out that way! LJ:  Totally agree in the bottle/plastic thing.  \"Everything\" causes cancer if we just wait long enough... Joteach and Peg1212:  Good to see you 2 checking in. PALady:  Glad to read your update.  Congrats on your negative BCRA, too-yup, good news!  Vettegal:  Big woohoo on Vettesis's news!  That is just fabulous!!! As someone else said, I hate getting behind on posts.  Don't know what I'm gonna do when I go back to working 4 days a week soon.  Read in the AM or over lunch maybe...  I WILL figure it out, wouldn't miss our chats here.",

I am excited to hear D1 got her secret pal, that means mine should be here tomorrow I'll bet.  Should be fun... Too pooped to give individual shout outs.  Tomorrow night I have a meeting for my Relay after dinner, so I don't even know if I'll be able to get on here to read. One final note... the parking lot at the hospital is a gazillion miles away from the entrance to the building-- guess that fulfills my wish for more exercise opportunities (have I NOT learned to be careful what I wish for????). ",

Work was overwhelming again-- more mentally than anything else.  Just trying to focus for 8 hrs again is taxing.  I had to take a nurses' math test today-- normally would've breezed through it quickly.  Needless to say, I barely finished and didn't do my usual stellar job.  Kind of funny story-- i had to park waaaay in the back parking lot today, a good 10-15 minute walk to the hospital entrance.  I was a little late since I had to park farther away than I expected, so I tried to pick up the pace, and by the time I got to the classroom I could barely breathe I was sucking wind so hard.  Great entrance I made!  Lesson for today-- I STILL need to go easy on myself (mentally and physically, and emotionally) and remember to take it one day at a time. Got my SP in the mail, too.  D1-- good question about limit on funds spent.  I think it would be nice to send small tokens as we can. Tomorrow I have \"off\"-- a meeting in the AM only.  I think I need it already... TTFN!",

Well, had my visit with my therapist today--- she's awesome and always gives me a great perspective.  It seems I've developed some \"cancer intolerance\"...  basically my bullshit detector is very keen now, and I've noticed I have little tolerance for people's crap and whining these days!  Anyone else notice this about themselves?  I am normally a very patient and understanding person, so this latest development had me a bit concerned.  It's apparently normal and quite \"rampant\" in survivors at this stage after tx.

OK, to clarify my comment about \"sun worshippers\"... you don't qualify in my book.  You are out there doing something (golfing, boating, gardening). I mean/was referring to people who are just lying outside baking to get the dark, dark tans-no other reason.  They also tend to avoid sunscreens b/c they want to char.  A dermatologist once told me, no tan is a good tan.  Pigment to the skin (tan) means there's been sun damage.  Now trust me, I like a little color too, but I think it's crazy to sit outside idly with oil on to tan!  Cathy-CA:  Bravo on the good mammo.  My center will also do the look-see while I'm there.  I get my \"annual\" in August.  U of U sounds like a place my dh would've loved!  He was a ski instructor in MA and loves the outdoor winter stuff.  Hope all goes well with your older ds and his sober house.  Diana:  Congratulations, Grandma!!  What better joy than holding a newborn baby?  Enjoy! Kris:  My port is staying in until I finish herceptin (Jan. '09).  I'll get it out as soon as I can after that-end of January '09?  I have had (knock on wood) no trouble with mine.  I carry my kids, lift things, swim, exercise, etc.  I just had to watch how I laid down during my recent massage (and she avoided the area over the port)-it hurts if I rub/lay directly on it. D1:  reading your post reminds me... my nails suck right now.  None have fallen off (so I shouldn't complain to you), but they all must be at the point where the \"bad area\" is at the end b/c they are all breaking real low down and look like crap again.  Real thin, peely, and brittle.  Yikes!  I'm loading up on the nail strengthener, and may resort to using the rest of my TTO again (maybe.  I hate the smell). Dana:  Good to hear from you, but so sorry you are having a tough time.  Court sounds like it will be quite stressful, especially on top of everything else in your life.  Do you have a counselor or someone to talk to while you are going through all this?  Try to keep your positive attitude.  Graduation is something to look forward to.  I hope your cancer drugs are working and you get some good news in August. Hope all the Jewels have a good week ahead.  How awesome it is that there's no chemo this week!",

I like the beach and anything beach-y, OPI nail polishes, cooking/baking (and eating!), seafood, Italian, gardening (planting stuff), Victoria's Secret, and reading bestsellers (I think I put that on my list, but I can't remember).  My music tastes are diverse: classical to Top 40 (like Pink, Carrie Underwood, Rihanna, Justin Timberlake; I know.... CRAZY!) )Thanks D1 for the reminder to update! Carol:  LOL on your boob decorations.  And so cool, I might add, that our pics will adorn your tent!  We'll be thinking of you.  I am amazed at your dedication to this walk. IMO, I'd ditch your port when you can.  It's probably not good to use it only every 6 months and have to flush every month; what a PITA, and a site for infection, too. Kimberly:  I empathize....work sucks!  I so hate that I can't be here as much as I used to be, and as much as I'd like. Sherry:  Hope your friend's biopsy is b-9! Don't know if I mentioned my annual mammo in August was OK.  What a feat to do with a port in place and b/c of the implant.  I also have shucked my wig for good now.  When we came home from \u2018cation I stopped wearing it at work (my last holdout).  People love my hair, I can't wait until October when I have an appointment to highlight it.

Saturday was also a big day.  I got my first official haircut!  This time I actually had enough for her to cut and color.  The curls are gone though... I guess that first cut really does them in.  I wasn't too attached to them anyway as they were quite unruly (but wish I'd taken a picture of them anyway... rats!).  The new \u2018do is a very rich caramel color with some blonde highlights on top in the front.  I've never colored my hair before, so this is all new to me.  But since I'm no longer blonde, I thought I'd embrace the brown.  Again, I'll try to get a picture.  I'm in the process of working on dh to buy a new camera... So, over to the boards...  I've missed a lot and just want to make some quick shout outs. Love all the recent pictures that have been posted... Joan, Julie and Norma, Sherry.  Everyone looks great!  Norma, my hair looked like yours before I had it cut.

D1:  I hope you follow through on your thought to see someone to discuss the issues at home with dh.  You seem like such an awesome person... you deserve to have every aspect of your life good!  I do hope things get better for you two. Loved reading about your dd.  Ain't young love grand?? Maz:  Nice to hear from you again.  I am scheduled to have my port out in January under \"twilight sedation\".  I am way too much of a chicken to be awake for that one.  Please report back on how yours goes. Therese:  Happy Belated Birthday!  Uh, Mother Nature wasn't so kind to you.  Hope you got something nicer from others! Carla:  Good to hear from you.  Another local news celeb among the Jewels!  How are things on the home front for you these days?

Carol:  Glad you liked yoga.  I really loved it when I did it.  I used to do that and Pilates each week-was a nice mix. And the twilight sedation... I say go for it!  My PS said many surgeons will take ports out without it, but she likes to use it so the patient isn't uncomfortable and/or moving too much so that she can do a better job.  I personally want no part of any pain, or even that tugging sensation I notice when local anesthetics are used...  I'm a wuss.  And you're only out for the port for like 20 minutes total. Glad your ds is getting some study skills help.  I think they should have a program like that in school (do they??).  What kid knows how to study without being shown?  I know I had to learn how to do it. Carla:  I am so sorry to read of your continued troubles with dh.  But I must say that you sound better and stronger than before.  Maybe things are clearer for you now?  I do think it speaks volumes that your girls are concerned enough to voice their opinions to you about him.  I hate to see anyone get divorced, but I think he is obviously mentally and verbally abusing you (and your daughters!)... and you deserve better!  We are here for you always, and I hope you can get strength from us to do whatever it is you decide.

The next month will be busy (like the past 2 haven't been for me?). Sunday is my birthday (#38).    My last herceptin (yes, I said LAST!) is 12/17.  I get my port out 1/9--- then I guess I'm officially done.  I'm a little scared.  Having that herceptin every 3 weeks has somehow given me the ability to forget about cancer and not worry.  I have felt soooo good and normal, it will be frightening to not have that safety net.  I haven't seen my therapist since... hmmm, maybe October?  May have to revisit in the New Year after I'm \"done\". Carol (SP)-- thanks for the last gift.  dh and I skimmed through it and agreed we'll have to try out some new seafood recipes!  D1-- I ditto what many have said about the therapist.  You need to find a good \"fit\", so if this one doesn't feel right, keep looking.  Paula-- so sorry to read about Ed.  I know you won't give up, and I wish you both well with the next treatment plan.  Kimberly-- hope your sister's surgery went well.  Kris-- thinking of you also and your surgery.  I am disheartened to hear of a Jewel having to go through that again so soon.  I also got my new SP yesterday.  Guess I need to get cracking on some ideas for this one :) I have read all the posts.  I'll try to not be a stranger and let life get in the way of keeping up here.  I just seem to need more hours in the day, or another day in the week-- but it's all good, I'm happy with the return of that pace.  So, even though I may not be around as much as before, please know that the Jewels are never gone from my thoughts.  I'll be around....",

Today's supposed to be my \"free\" day off.  How do I always end up with a full day regardless?  I'm off to the dentist and then the eye doctor for my f/u on that weird eye stuff that happened.  DD has dance class tonight.  So, I'm gonna try and catch up on my comments from the posts now.  I hope y'all haven't been too chatty since I last checked... Carla:  WTG with the tat.  Sounds really cool.  Maybe someday I'll get one, but I just can't get over the needle phobia right now. Vettegal:  Those pics are beautiful and I LOVE your hair BTW.  It looks great. And way to score better seats at a concert-now that's using poopie power! CHJ:  LOL at your post to Vettegal about the Steelers.  I must say that being in Eagles/Ravens territory and a former eastern PA-transplant to DE, I am definitely on board with the Ravens right now (vs Steelers).  However dh and I will steadfastly root anyday for anyone to kick the Eagles a**, even the Steelers.  Donovan McNabb annoys the hell out of me. D1:  Nice to read that you had break, albeit brief one, from your LE the other morning.  Maybe it's a sign that things are improving and good things are to come.  Happy to report that ds is still pottying with minimal accidents (a few over the weekend, but that's it).  Maybe my days of daytime diapers are almost gone!  Hey, it's nice to talk about my kids toilet habits for once instead of my own like I did last year this time-hahaha! And as for dh and his timing-that man can get horny just about anytime.  It's almost disgusting, and I just don't understand it.  How can me walking in front of the TV while the game is on do anything?  Sheesh!  Guess I should be thankful he still notices me though, huh? Wing:  Good to see you again.  Dh is still licking his wounds from his Pats sad showing this year, too.  He's from North Adams and a die-hard MA fan... Pats, Bruins, Red Sox. Cathy-CA:  Congrats on the final herceptin!!!  Next up... de-port-ation for you.  It's such a weird feeling no longer going for the herceptin infusions.  Hope all goes well for you, my fellow HER2+ sis! Joan:  Congrats on your good test results.  LJ:  That last herceptin's just around the corner for you, too.  Yeah!! Carol:  How do you find all the time to write here AND check out Vegas spots??  Do you seriously get paid for your job??  Just joking... I'm glad someone can do it and throw out ideas for us.  I need to find some time to surf Vegas stuff, too.  Kimberly:  Hope you feel better soon.  I'm sure it's no fun teaching while you feel like crap.  And probably one of your students shared their germs with you in the first place!  Drink lots, rest, and eat some soup (I know you know that already).  BTW, I just read an article on the correlation between lack of sleep and catching the common cold virus (less sleep= more chance of illness basically).  More reason for me to sleep, I say! GTG Jewels.  TTFN!",

So anyway, I wonder what all those hormones did to me.  I have no other BC risk factors other than my age of starting to have kids (31 with my first).  But my BC is ER/PR -.  They still won't let me restart the BC pills.. and frankly, I'd be afraid to.",

Carol:  Cool you can do the shirts!!  Let me know later how they run for sizing and I'll give you my size-- probably medium or large.  Also if 100% cotton or not (then I get bigger for shrinkage).  Kimberly had the specifics on styling... I think she thought of black shirts with hot pink writing and the pink ribbon on there somewhere.  The back was gonna say \"Sisters in Survival\". I think we should add some sparkle somewhere if it can be done since we are jewels (pink rhinestones for the ribbon?).  I personally wouldn't want names, just keep it simple.  Also the breastcancer.org sounds cool-- but we may not be able to do it b/c of copyrighting and also b/c it advertises the site.  But I like the FUBC over the pocket idea.",

D1:  I've also added Deb3girls to my paper list.  I saw she's joined us and wanted to make sure you caught that.  Hope you are doing well today and everyone's good posts have lifted you up some. Golfer (Carol):  I so think I'll be asking for Ativan or Xanax when I see my onc Tuesday, the day before I start round1.  Thanks for reminding me! Deb:  So glad to hear round 1 went well!  I was told to take antinausea meds (I got Zofran since I'm allergic to Compazine), for 2-3 days after chemo.  I say go for it all so the SEs have no chance to get you! Kimberly: our poet laureate!  Loved the latest one.  Someday when your book's famous i can say I knew you when...  I loved the martini glass idea while at chemo.  Hope you don't mind if I borrow it next week!  I'll give you credit of course   Glad to hear your round 1 went well so far, too.  Keep going strong!  And thanks for thinking of my dad.  He's loving the stories I tell him about our group and has been inspired to take on the same positive energy we all have I think. DanaC:  I get my port Monday and will share all the details if you'd like.  I was told the entire thing takes about 1/2 hr.  I'm going outpt. surgery with MAC (kinds like twilight) anesthesia.  My surgeon likes that just so I don't move and she says she has to push on me some... if I'm under I won't mind (yeah, until later on when I feel that bruise!).  The Herceptin is generally given for a year total.  Sometimes it's started right on day one with chemo depending on what you get (I'm doing this), other times it's started later on and that's why treatment can be over one year total.  They do not like to give herceptin with other cardiotoxic drugs-- like Adriamycin, so if that's in your cards, the herceptin will be given after that drug is done and the treatment time will be over one year.  Hope that all made sense.  Herceptin is not chemo, it's considered a targeted biological agent and it does not cause all the bad SEs (like n/v , hair loss, anemia, leukopenia, etc.) of chemo.  I hear it mostly makes you feel flu-like for a day afterwards, and can give a fever sometimes.  The biggest problem with herceptin is it can cause heart problems, so a MUGA scan or other test for cardiac function is done before you start and also a few times during the year you're on it. Catch all you ladies later.  I guess I gotta get to work now!",

D1:  Love your posts on the hair. You crack me up!  About the list...I am thinking I am so \"Type A\", chemo-brain will not be able to break the barrier!  At least I hope not or I'll go nuts.  Maybe it will be my mental exercise to keep up on everything.  We'll keep each other in check.  OK, so today I added RN2teach and PAlady so far.  I see we're up-to-date otherwise.  Gotta go shower and head off for the port.  Yay-- can't wait to feel like I've been kicked in my nice new rack!",

Yes, I watched GMA also-- she looks amazing.  But hey, wouldn't we all if we had our own make-up artists and the best wigs money can buy?  Hahaha!  NO seriously, she looked great and is an inspiration.  About the ports sticking out... mine does, too, but not too badly (and I'm really thin there, my clavicles stick out).  It's still hard for me to say b/c it's so bruised that's all I notice right now.  But the soreness is almost gone already and I can almost sleep on that side again.  Yay!  I still have to say it is so worth it having the port-- it's my new best bud-- to not have to get stuck all the time and no sensation at all with infusions.  I love it! So today I am still faring pretty well.  My worst problem is constipation (sorry girls with the gross topic, but I know others have had this happen).  It was like birthing a cinder block today!  I have had really no nausea except when the stomach cramps hit me.  I've been wearing Sea-Bands today mostly to ward off the waves as they hit.  And my onc's office had me switch to just plain Colace today (instead of Senna-S).  I might actually be overdoing the fiber intake too which my pharmacist said will make the stomach cramps worse.  Lovely topic today, huh?  So here's to hoping tomorrow will be a better poop day!  My onc's nurse warned me tomorrow I could \"hit the brick wall\" with SEs-- gee thanks for the confidence.  She said to expect lots of aches and pains from the TC-- anybody else have that with the TC combo on day 2-3 (I can't remember)???  Today I 've been eating small meals and snacks, loading up on water, and plan to go walk again on the treadmill after I type here.  I actually feel good-- scary to say.  I feel like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop.  I've had a little bit of \"nervous stomach\" but haven't had to take any Zofran at all (and hope not to since that'll make the constipation worse).  Did anyone have the nausea hit after the first 24 hrs.?  I don't hear it happening too much but wanted to ask anyway.  Everyone has told me if it happens, it happens within the first day.  OK, I'm nervous... Well, I'll try to check in later tonight and see how everybody's day went.",

For the new dates this week, I'll edit my post above. Thanks to JulieK and D1 for new info.  Keep it coming! And as a mom of little ones (2 and 5 year old), yes it makes this chemo thing tough!   My 2 year old doesn't get it-- maybe that's good.  I'll be curious to see his reaction when I'm bald :)  My 5 year old daughter, on the other hand, is pretty bright if I must say so myslef-- she doesn't miss anything.  Last night we had another talk about the hair.  She wanted to know when it would come out (I said I don't know).  We decided to make a game of it and we all picked a date we thought it would happen-- whoever's closest wins a prize.  Then she was worried she'd have to take the same \"medicine\" someday when she was a big girl (I told her chemo was a special medicine to make me better and it was so strong, it was gonna knock my hair off my head, but that it would grow back eventually).  It broke my heart to hear her ask me that question-- I told her I hoped she'd never have to take the same medicine (come on science.. pull through in the next 15-20 years!) and not to worry about it now, but if she ever did have to, to remember we'd get through it.  I explained that the medicine she takes now here and there (Tylenol, cold stuff...) is totally different and wouldn't ever make her hair fall out.  Whew!  In the end we talked about when my hair would grow back... also another \"surprise\"-- so she decided she'll check it each day after my last treatment to see if my hair's growing like the spring flowers and grass!  Gotta love her.  My last tx is right before Easter, so she thought of spring. The other night when I felt really bad and achy, she covered me up with a blanket and told me it was ok and to rest.  She's definitely had her \"kid moments\" though of fighting with her brother and crying and whining.  Those times are tough-- thankfully my husband is a great dad.  And my mom came down for 3 days to help.   This past weekend my daughter had a b-day party she went to-- good timing, it was one evening to keep her occupied.  Yesterday afternoon one she went to one of her friends' houses to play until dinnertime (bless that mom!).  I am just lucky to have lots of support-- I couldn't do this alone for sure. Sorry to go off about \"me\" there!  Had to get it out :) ",

Vettegal:  One way to tell if white patches in your mouth or on your tongue are thrush--- scrape gently with your toothbrush, if it doesn't come off at all... it's thrush!  This is a test we use on babies to tell if it's thrush or milk/formula (but we use a tongue depressor, not a toothbrush). PALady:  ANC= absolute neutrophil count (or the true number of \"baby\"/immature WBCs).  I'm pretty tired, so I'll check in tomorrow more.  Good luck to all the Jewels undergoing treatments this week.  Kick some BCA!",

Sunshine, joteach, jackieb: all you chemo virgins... we're here for you girls!  It really will be OK.  As everyone else said, the fear of the unknown is the worst.  Round one will be a learning experience.  The best way to prepare is read over this thread and take notes.  Stock up foods you like to eat when you may not feel like eating (if you know what I mean): jello, yogurt, ginger ale, crackers, soups, etc.  Remember to drink A LOT!  Start this even the day before chemo.  Take all your meds!  And I agree with D1 about the house and paperwork: priorities change... do not stress over this stuff.  Evereyday will not be a bad day either.  Most of us here seemed to have our \"bad day\" about day 3-4 (treatment day is day one).  And regardless of what happens during your course, the best thing you could have done is found this thread!  You are never really whining here and the support is absolutely the best therapy for any SE you get :)  You CAN do this!!

Glad some of you got to the Look Good Feel Better class-- it was cool and I love the makeup I got.

Herceptin weekly should be fine, just time consuming.  And the T sounds like it may be better since lower dose. Deb102307: #2 seems to be kicking everyone's butt if that's any consolation to you.  Gee, can't wait to see what's in store for me this weekend...   OK, so my day.  You should all start learning by now... I'm the fun one!  Today was round #2 and I did not escape unscathed.  Had a reaction 5 minutes into my Taxotere-- saw white lights, flushed face and neck, and couldn't breathe.  Thankfully they were right on top of me, stopped the infusion, gave me saline and oxygen, Benadryl, and Decadron.  Waited a half hour and then restrted slowly.  I did fine the rest of the time.  But it was kinda scary.  So now I'll get the extra decadron and benadryl each time with the slow infusion.  Hope it doesn't happen again.  I was there 5 1/2 hrs. today and that will probably not change much for my next 2 rounds.  My onc said \"you're at it again\"- I reminded him I wanted to make the most of my 4 rounds and thought this way everyone would remember me!  I am pretty tired (probably the Benadryl-- maybe I'll sleep better tonight).  Never a dull moment with me!  Tomorrow I'll return for my Neulasta.  Not looking forward to the SEs of the weekend... hope it's not as eventful as today (MAYBE I can get a break???).  TTFN, I'll check in tomorrow!",

LJ13:  With my herceptin so far I've noticed a runny nose and some flu-like sx (mostly just feel hot/cold off and one for a day or two-- no aches). Though it's hard to say for sure b/c I am getting the T/C at the same time. But these are the sx they told me are proably herceptin related.  I have not heard about herceptin and nail changes-- only nail changes with taxol/taxotere.  My onc also said the neuropathy is taxol/taxotere related, not a SE of herceptin.  I've pulled out my drug sheets and books and can't find it listed as herceptin SE either.  Herceptin can also cause cardiac problems like decreased ejection fraction of the heart-- thus the frequent MUGAs we should be getting.  I hear if this happens it usually fixes itself once the herceptin is stopped.  Hope this helps.  Dana:  Big hugs to you!  Everyone has given you some awesome advice already.  I'll just add that you ARE worthy and deserve so much better than him.  At least you've realized your mistake before marrying him or having kids with him.  Things will get better-- you are a survivor, will be a great nurse someday soon, and will find Mr. Right someday when you probably least expect it.  Hang in there-- we're all here for you! Carol:  Love the pic!  You look great!!! Vettegal:  I noticed HA with round one and again with round 2 (it seems to hit me the day after each round).  Tylenol and increasing fluids seem to help-- plus sleeping!  My taste buds seem to get funky for about 7-10 days, but then return.  It usually starts the day after chemo for me-- water and chocolate are my worse tasting things.  Everything else just tastes weird or tasteless, not bad.  Good night Jewels.  I need to drink one more glass of water (with lime to mask the yuk taste) and then hit the sack after I wash up.  I plan on taking the next 2-3 days real slow and resting as I know these are my \"bad days\" coming up.  Hope to shave some stubble off if I can, as round 2 seems to have kicked the hair loss up a notch again-- stubble everywhere today!  Good luck to everyone tomorrow and those of us hitting the SE weekend!",

      "Content": "Feb 8, 2008 04:31AM - edited Feb 8, 2008 04:48AM by KathyL Good morning Jewels!  I seem to be the early bird.  I went to bed at 8 last night and slept really well until 6-ish when the dh and kids got up to get ready for the day.  Awake now and pushing fluids as I didn't have any overnight.  I was SOOO tired yesterday-- a day earlier than last time, so I'm going to take it real easy today I think.  Kris60:  Man, so many things that can mess up our sleep-- all the drugs (specifically the steroids), the stress (where do you even being there??), and our crazy minds that sometimes won't stop!  Try a nice relaxing bedtime ritual (soft music, a visualization tape-- I got a great one that usually does the trick, nice soothing drink...).  And watch the timing of your meds near bedtime.  A lot here have recommended taking the last day's dose of steroids by 3PM to help with sleep.  I haven't had too much trouble with them and I take my PM dose at 7:30. Bet your kid will get a kick out of giving you your shot.  She'll probably be pretty good at it, too.  I'm amazed at how well my diabetic patients (I'm a peds. NP) do with needles.  I'm trying to not thinkabout the cost of Neulasta either.  I hear it's pretty expensive, but after my hospital stint with the non-existent WBC/ANC, I doubt BCBS would have a leg to stand on in denying me it!  Sounds like you dropped low, too.  It should prevent that from happening next time. WVgirl:  Oh, you and Dana make me so sad.  I wish I could just make it all better for you both.  Please make sure you get someone to talk to professionally-- for your sake.  And don't make excuses either.  If he's not the right one, it doesn't matter about the kids, the house, the job... it all works out.  My parents divorced when I was 19 and in college, my brother was 16 and in HS still.  Looking back, I don't know how my parents stayed married for 23 years... they are so much happier now apart; like 2 totally different people.  My bro and I survived the divorce with counseling, and came out OK. My mom is a teacher (and was then, too), my dad definitely made more $$$.  She found a nice house eventually and is doing really well for herself. She will be retiring this year (age 62).  I know I'm rambling, but just remember you have so much on your plate you need to focus on getting through the cancer tx now-- but this is something you should probably be talking with a professional about (with or without him) to be able to address when you're better.  There's always a choice and a way.  You deserve to be happy and treated well always and forever!  Especially now when you need it most.  Keep venting for us... so many here have great suggestions. Dana: You sound so much better.  Love the nursing stories-- I can appreciate them on the same level of yuckiness/messiness as you (the poop and CPR).  You have got such a great outlook.  I know you're gonna be fine :) Would love to do a get-together/reunion, too.  I'd actually said something to D1 a while ago in a PM about it.  I am not much of a traveler (hate to fly), but I'd try it for all of you.  H*ll, a plane can't be any worse than cancer has been, right?  Just some suggestions-- a spa somewhere?  We could all do a nice long relaxing weekend somewhere that would cater to us and pamper us.  Or a big beach bash.  I go to a private beach in NC each summer (very quiet and relaxing)-- people take pics of their vacation group and tell their stories and each year the realtors pick a family/group to win a free vacation (so know we could get that!).  They have beautiful oceanfront houses called \"Sand Castles\" that you can rent for the week, with all the amenities; expensive, but with our numbers, we could handle it splitting the cost.  Some houses will hold 20 people! ",

D1 (and Carol):  I think the Taxotere causes the puffiness (fluid retention)-- face and legs I noticed with round #1.  Waiting to see what happens with this round.  Paleness is from chemo itself, but also happens if your red cell count is low (anemia).  I noticed my gums, nailbeds, and inner eyelids were really pale when my counts were down.   And D1:  HAPPY 50th tomorrow!  Have some cake for me.  I'm be thinking of you and am so glad to have \"met\" you-- this thread is amazing, thanks to you for starting it. Texrn: Good to hear form you.  I hear the fatigue is cumulative somewhat.  Sorry the SEs are hitting you all over.  I think with kids we especially are tired from chasing them around-- I know I am.  One more round for you though-- awesome!  Good idea too about buzzing the hair at the end so it all grows in the same.  I also noticed the eye twitching a lttile.

JKiss:  Totally understand the stress added with little ones around (my 2 and 5 year old I referred to before).  Sorry you have more to deal with with your DH/dh.  Sometimes though I am glad to have my kids to keep me busy-- I look at them and remember they are half the reason I'm going through this sh*t-- to be there to see them grow up.  I give them big hugs a lot and thank my lucky stars to have them... they are my world and what gets me through this and makes me keep puttng one foot in front of the other.  Keep venting to us, and yes, cry!  It's OK and needed.  Hugs to you! Cathy-CA:  My hair with TC started coming out about day 16.  I shaved it about day 19 b/c it was clumps coming out by then.  Interestingly, I'm day 26 (from #1 tx) and still have patchy hair on my head.  But the stubble is easier to clean up for sure.  Hang on to yours as long as you can stand it, I say! Can't wait to hear your info from the derm. You have good stuff to report a lot! Sheshe: Good to hear from you.  Hope the abx help and you feel better soon.  You are so not being selfish-- this is the place to vent! OK, and hate to tell ya, but no go for me and a cruise.  I have major sea-sickness and after chemo... no way!  But if everyone does something else, I'll be there.  June 2009 would be great as the kids will be out of school by then.",

SIS Kimberly:  Our school district assigns a school based on neighborhood location.  If you don't want to go there, you have to \"choice\" somewhere else and that's a hassle, and you might not get in.  Luckily, the preschool the kids go to, which will also be dd's before/after school location for kindergarten, is in the same area... so we don't have to \"choice\" her.  Too bad you live on the opposite coast, I'd love to write with you!  I still think a book about us Jewels would sell for sure. I'm also waiting for my annual eye exam.  I'm hoping my supply of contacts will make it.  Anyone know how long we should wait after chemo to get our eyes checked again?  I usually post the week's \"events\" all at once on Sunday.  Does this work OK for everyone.  Just making sure... JackieB:  Good luck Thrusday.  Do you have your other dates?  That way I can include you on the weekly lists.  I did not have Thurs. for you.. sorry I didn't post it with the others.  I'll add it now to that post. D1:  \"hair whores\"???!!  LOL!  I was almost crying I was laughing so hard over that one!  My onc recommended nail care for the taxotere (or any taxane) as follows:  tea tree oil twice a day to all nails and cuticles, and apply a nail strengthener 1-2 times a week.  The TTO smells, but I do it just in case it saves my nails... I figure it can't hurt.  I got it at GNC.  And I use OPI's Nail Envy twice a week to my finger nails.  I don't polish my toes regularly, but they have a nail strenghtening base and top coat on already. Kris60:  ditto what D1 said to you.  Drink, rest, check temp!  #2 seems to kick a** for most of us.  Hang in there.. another (big) bump in the road, but you'll do OK. Carol:  I've heard about the ice theory too.  Someone on another thread posted about it.  I guess the theory goes that if the area is cold (head, nails, hands/feet, mouth) with ice during the infusion of a chemo drugs (like the taxanes-- I mostly hear it in reference to them), then the drug will not \"go there\" as quickly, and thus will have less or no SE there (like tingling, nail or hair loss, etc.).  I think the same is true of sucking on ice with cytoxan infusion-- less mouth sores and metallic taste.  I DO drink ice water and suck on ice all through my chemo, and especially the 1/2 hr of cytoxan (just ice then)... and so far I've not had a single mouth sore.  But I also do a lot of mouthcare.  So, who knows what's doing it.. and maybe I'm just lucky.  I personally don't want to put ice on my head.. and my hands and feet are already cold, so I don't really want to ice them either.  I think the Europeans do a lot of research in this area. Glad you had a good golf outing.  Some exercise and fresh air are the greatest medicine! Have a good day Jewels!",

Wing: after reading your post about all your snow, I saw you're from Mass.  dh grew up in North Adams and was a ski instructor at Jiminy Peak.  Don't know which side of the state you're on.  He's always telling me about all the snow they get up there ( I tease him he's a \"snow snob\").  D1: hope your dh's flight comes in OK in this mess.  I'm sure you'll be glad to have him home.  Sorry to hear about your dd's night last night.  Hope she does well on Sunday at her tryouts.  And your support top for LE sounds like a d*mn corset!!  Yikes! LJ:  Hope your T/H SEs are minimal.  I'm sure they'll be better than the AC.  My friend who did AC, then T said the T was soooo much better.  Watch out for #2-- that's when the taxanes seem to get us all (my friend included).  But with all your pre-meds... you should do fine.  Tell them to run it SLOW.  Vettegal:  glad you made it to the computer after your sucky week.  The runs are as bad as the cinder blocks!  Vent about the rest of the week when you can-- we've all been there!  Feel better soon. SIS Kim: another gem down.  I hate to read about fellow Jewels feeling bad.  But I know you'll bounce back in a few days.    (((Hugs))) to you. Sheshe:  Hmmm... \"suspicious foci\".  I hate that!  I wonder if there's anyway they can clarify it now... or get someone else to take a look for a second opinion?  I had 3 pathologists look at my original lump to confirm the dx.  Probably doesn't matter too much though since you're already doing chemo-- that'll take care of anything \"suspicious\"! Tina:  rest easy this weekend and lurk when you can.  you can always write next week. Well, I'm hoping to enjoy my weekend as I know next weekend I'll be feeling like doo-doo.  Really not looking forward to #3, but knowing it will be one more step towards being done.  dd has \"bring a friend to gymnastics\" day tomorrow-- they get to dress like princesses, too.  Sunday I'm going to a Lissa Cole purse party-- sooo cool; you design your own purse (at a party, of course), send the specifics, and get your completed purse back in about 6 weeks.  This'll be my third; it's my new obsession.  My last purse was a pink one for BC that I use all the time now.  My dad might be able to visit Sunday, too.  I haven't seen him since early January after he had his heart bypass surgery and before I started chemo.  So, I'll be lurking this weekend since I may not have time to write after reading posts.  Will post this coming week's line up though before Monday. Have a good weekend all and rest easy. Good night Jewels!",

We don't want you to get burnt in the first place.  Wear loose fitting tops for sure-- I've heard your skin does feel hot.  My friend applied cornstarch powder alot to her skin to avoid chafing.  And while you're shopping, hit a healthfood store for some \"natural\" deodorant-- you won't be able to wear your usual b/c they contain stuff that interferes with rads.  I'll ask my friend what she liked.  And as for the le-- you're doing everything you can, just keep it up.  Focus on the fact that you are working on it on as best you can, it could be irreversible... but it also COULD GO AWAY :) Carol:  yeah, 2.8 is low.  Mine when I was hospitalized was 1.1.  Make sure they check a level again in about a week.  Be super careful right now about being out and about, especially with flu so rampant (at least it is here).  Avoid crowds and sick people as best you can-- you're at a higher risk for infection when your WBCs are below normal.  Handwash like crazy, too.  Most people's levels WILL bounce back up on their own in about 7-10 days.  This is also a time to be sure you are washing produce very well, and cooking all meats thoroughly. And, oh yeah... hope your pooper's settled down.  We go from Miralax to Immodium in one day don't we???  Eat some bananas! Dana:  Glad to hear you're doing so well.  Yay!  You need a good break after all the stuff you've been through recently.  The burny butt is also probably from just chemo in general-- does a nasty job on the way out!  Try a squirt bottle to clean instead of wiping a lot, and nice warm soaks in the tub. Sheshe:  got the new date!  Sorry to hear you got pushed back, but at least it was only for 2 days and you're still pretty much on track.",

I took everyone's advice and whipped out the makeup bag from LGFB.  I hardly ever wear makeup, and rarely put on foundation unless it's a real special event... but today I went all out, and I must admit it covered up a lot of the dark circles and \"tiredness\".  I felt great, and actually had two people tell me I looked really good (did I look like crap before???).  Therapist visit was great-- I always feel awesome after seeing her and kvetching. Lunch with dh was nice too-had a really yummy chicken salad.  Went to see my ps, which was uneventful.  She basically said \"looks good, see you in a month\", then we'll talk about the nipple.  Oh well, good things come to those who wait I guess.  At least I don't pay a co-pay for her visits-it's all considered follow-ups, so she doesn't charge them.  Then I went down to my favorite boutique where I got my wigs and a bunch of hats.  It's fairly new and I really like the lady who owns it, so I've referred a bunch of people there.  She gave me a free hat today for all the people I've sent there!  It's a cute denim baseball cap with the pink ribbon logo on the front.  I was gonna buy it but she said \"no, take it\".  Nice to have a great day before next week... dreading that even though it's my last chemo. Vettegal:  So sorry to hear about your sister.  I hope it turns out benign.  Have you guys had the BRCA test done??  You 3 are in my prayers.  FUBC! LJ:  Hope today went well for you! Tinalee, Kimberly, Carol:  All you girls and your wine talk.  I have to admit I've never been much of a drinker, but I do like the taste of wine.  Cancer I think had driven me to say WTF though-maybe I'll start!  I'd like to develop an appreciation at least.  My problem is, most wines give me a headache.  Any suggestions for ones that might not do this?  I love whites and pinks.  Reds always just taste too tart (dry?) to me. Tinalee:  I feel the same about the timing of my BC dx.  I was pissed and I remember thinking-I don't have time for BC in my life.  Still hate that aspect of it and how it has taken my life over (temporarily!  I WILL claim it back soon).  But I'm also starting to realize that in some ways, it has changed me for the better.  I have learned to slow down, focus on me, and focus on what really matters-new priorities that really do make me happier.  I'm also learning to not sweat the small stuff-was always very hard for perfectionist me to do! Like you, I have no history and I think a lot about what caused this BC in me.  There's gotta be something out there for sure.  I plan on eating better and exercising more.  I did everything else right I feel (d*mn, shoulda tried weed in college).  I don't eat badly, but I could do better.  And I've had periods in my life where I've exercised well, then others (like recently with 2 kids), where I do none.  I'm lucky b/c I've always been underweight or at a decent/normal weight.  But now I'm motivated to do something regardless.  I'd love to live long enough for them to find out what caused this tho', b/c SOMETHING made those cells go wacky in a young, healthy woman!  I like reading everyone's take on this subject BTW.  For my two cents on it all--I also think stress has lot to do with it.  It's been shown to take a toll on our immune systems. Defintely not good for our bodies.  Probably not good in the gene pool either.   And D1, I agree--all the d*mn BC pills--- I don't think they helped me with much other than keeping me from getting knocked up in my 20s. Dana:  There is a man out there for you honey.  None of them are perfect, but one will be perfect for you.  In the meantime, love those doggies and enjoy Dana Time! Kimberly:  Yahoo on your Oprah idea!  That's totally the message we need to send to her.  How could she resist us Jewels??  Rest easy this weekend as the fog descends. Paula:  Sorry to hear dh's evening was sidelined by his seizure.  Hope his MRI goes well tomorrow. Sorry, this was longer than I thought!  See everyone tomorrow.  Good luck to Deb and Paula!",

This site is for support-come when you need it-and join in when you are able! Gonna add Deanna Favre's book to my list of books to read since a few have posted it's a good one. JulieK:  Sleep is goooood!  Glad it helped with the migraine.  I'll be cocooned up soon with my heating blankie when the aches start Friday. Can't believe we've had that many views!  Wow!  Of course, we do have 60-something pages of posts!  People probably wonder what we could talk about that much.  Still think we need to convince Oprah's people to take a look.

Carol:  Your spa day sounds sooo nice.  I may have to treat myself once I'm done and recuperated from chemo-I'd love to get a massage.  I watched DWTS last night.  No faves yet.  I barely knew any of the men.  Tonight's gonna be hard to decide (thank God for Tivo!)-DWTS or American Idol.  Idol may win out... Gotta get moving.  Need to start the \u2018roids, get a shower, and head to the oncs.  Not happy-my onc is away this week and I'm seeing someone else today.  I have a ton of questions and I want some adjustments to my Taxotere after all the drama I've had with it.  Not sure if someone that doesn't know me will be receptive.  Oh well for them... they're gonna hear me anyway.",

CarolC:  I think we all have that fear of recurrence regardless of what stage or type of BC we have.  I don't think anyone was offended by your comments (I maybe speak for me-I wasn't).  It sucks that medicine unfortunately is a \"gray\" field, not with black-and-white answers.  There is never a 100% guarantee, as someone will always be the exception to the rules.  Keep you chin up and try to focus on the positives. SIS Kimberly:  So sorry the fatigue is lasting longer for you-that seems to be the case for a lot of us. One foot in front of the other, and as you say... live in this moment.  I have to also say that reading your posts is just so uplifting (no pun intended to us BC girls!).  You have such a gift with words.  I am honored to know you and benefit from your insight. Vettegal:  Thinking of you and your sister.  I hope her biopsy goes smoothly and the wait time for results is not too excruciatingly long for her. Maz:  I am thinking of you as you have this extra stress in your life now to deal with.  Remember, you are only handed what God feels you can make it through. We are here for you.  You are a strong Jewel.  Hang in there. Jenn51:  I, too, am a member of the \"sausage club\".  Hating that SEs as it also adds to the weight gain on top of the overall lack of beauty. My onc this week kinda blew it off as \"just an expected SE\"; he wasn't my usual.  So, even though I'm done with my TC now, I'll be asking my usual onc about how long he thinks it will last when I see him again in 3 weeks.  I can barely get my rings off by lunchtime, I think I'm just going to leave them off for now. I picked up Deanna Favre's book from my cancer center's library.  I'll probably start reading it when I'm confined to the couch this weekend.  I looks good just from a quick skim of the excerpts. And while reading about your ds Clay... my heart goes out to him (and you) and his difficulty/sorrow with your BC.  But I think the positive thing is that he does call you and verbalizes his feelings-that's huge!  I would encourage it, and maybe see if talking to someone like a counselor would also help him through this (can't hurt). To everyone with thoughts of spring:  I went out and bought myself some tulips the others day: orange with red accents.  They look pretty and smell wonderful-what a pick-me-up!  Can't wait for some more warm weather. Julie:  Glad you had a good day catching up with a former student.  You must've had such an impact on her for her to return years later to chat. Carol:  Had a thought for you about planting.  I, too, am Type A and hate having someone else do things I love to do.  I forget what I had going on last year when it was time to plant, but couldn't do it.  So I bought the plants I wanted (one step), and then I literally laid the pods out exactly how and where I wanted them (step two, another day)-dh only had to dig the holes, plant the plant, and water them.  I even mixed up the fertilizer the way I like it done.  It was a huge relief for me to ahve some control but also be able to rest, and they turned out great. To those watching shows:  I liked DWTS this week.  Girl faves: definitely Marisa and Kristi.  Watched AI's results last night and was so disappointed.  While I don't think Amanda would have made it all the way, I don't think she shoulda been next to go--shoulda been Kristy Lee.  And what was up with the Irish chick being bottom 3 (her name escapes me right now-chemobrain)??? She's the best girl overall--somebody got that one wrong! Dana:  Clarify for me which day is your b-day... the 20th or 21st?  Have a great day whichever it is!! Think I'm caught up now.  My extra benadryl yesterday gave me a good block of sleep last night.  Today I have my usual hot/cold feelings (I think it's the herceptin).  I also have flushed cheeks-maybe the extra decadron they gave me yesterday.  The pit/rock in my stomach is back--no real appetite today.  But really, not too bad overall.  I have to go get my last neulasta shot this afternoon.  I'm going to try to whip up some ricotta cheese brownies this morning to thank my great chemo nurses for getting me through so far.  My wonderful mom is coming down this morning too to stay until Monday.  GTG--need some food in the belly and refill on the drink.  Hope everyone has a good day, and GL to those getting tx today.",

Cathy-CA:  Those brownies I made are to die for if I must say so myself.  They smelled great while cooking, but there's no way I could eat them right now-choc. just tastes so bad; it's a shame b/c it's almost my 5th food group usually.  The nurses loved them though, so that made me happy that someone was enjoying them!  One girl said they were so good, they made her swear!  Hahaha!  I'd be happy to share the recipe with anyone who wants it. And your story about your teacher was just so sad.  I'm sorry.  I think it would've made you cry even without all the BC emotions bopping around in your head.  I hope she is at peace now. Vettegal:  Glad your mom got good news on her BC shrinking.  I hope it keeps heading in that direction for her. OK girls, I am caught up.  Today's not too bad yet.  Just kinda tired.  The stomach's not real happy but no debilitating nausea.  I've got most of my Easter stuff done, so I really can just sit back and let it all happen around me.  Happy Easter to all who celebrate it.  I'll be checking in as I can this weekend.",

Good luck with 12 hr. shifts.  I used to do them all the time.  But once I had kids, I backed off to 8 hrs instead.  It's a long day. Julie:  Sorry to hear the migraines have got you down again.  Wish they could find a way to alleviate them for you.  You have had such a rough time, my friend!  Rest easy this weekend and sleep. D1:  LOL-hairless beavers.  NO comment! I'll be interested in hearing what the xrays are for with your rad txs.  I've never heard of that before. Well, if bil is complaining-I say that's a good sign!  Glad he's off the vent and showing some signs of moving in the right direction. Jenn51:  I love my contacts... Acuvue Oasys.  They're designed for drier eyes anyway, maybe that's why I've done well with them through chemo.  I had also heard that vision could get worse with chemo-luckily, mine was fine (the exact same actually as last year) when I went yesty.  One small good thing-I'll take it! Aaaack!  I did not know herceptin could also cause swelling.  Not happy about that.  I'll be a huge balloon by Jan. 2009!  I'm DEFINITELY gonna ask about this dratted water retention on Tuesday. SIS Kimberly:  Wishing you lots of restful sleep for the weekend to get you through the worst part of your SEs.  Hang in there, Jewel! PALady:  Hope rads goes well for you. D326:  Good luck next week.  By Wednesday you'll no longer be a chemo virgin! The secret to my organization is lots of Post-its, lists, and a very Type A personality!    But, don't give me too much credit-the kids are at preschool during the day. Sunshine:  Congrats on finishing chemo!",

Vettegal: Great idea about the t-shirts!    And hoping each day of recovery after your sugery is a step forward for you and you feel better. Golfer: I also don't think the neulasta/neupogen is always a given.  My onc. told me he uses it for the DD (dose dense) regimens-- those given every 2 weeks.  For those doing every 3 weeks (like me), he doesn't do it unless your counts drop too low.  I'm hoping mine doesn't, but not a thing I can do about it anyway.  I agree with Sharon, I'd probably do the neupogen (5 days of shots) if I had a choice.  My friend is doing the neulasta and says it hurts (some of the others here said the same I think)! Sheshe:  Can't believe you were fired by a BC survivor!  That truly sucks (can we say that here???).  YuYu: Maybe what you're feeling from the expander is that your swelling has gone down and you're more aware of the expander edges.  I remember this happening for me and I was freaked that it was moving too.  My PS says they really can't do that, they are placed in a pocket the PS forms for them.  Glad to hear you're doing well anyway!  Wait 'til the next step-- getting rid of the expander.  It's heaven   And the time goes by faster than you think. D1:  Yes, I'm doing T/C for 4 rounds.  But I got the port because I'm also doing a year of herceptin (IV only).  I hate needles and couldn't stand the thought of getting an IV every 3 weeks for a year.  That's why I'm getting the port.  Good news is my PS will take it out in the end, so less scarring! Kimberly:  I shoulda been a teacher.  You have great benefits.  My whole family is in education.  I'm the only one in healthcare right now.  My brother was a teacher but he's in Atlanta now doing PA school.  Just curious why you have to do breast, ovaries, and uterus?  I have a friend who is BRCA 1 AND 2 positive.  Her docs recommended b/l mast. and only ovary removal.  She's premenopausal.  I'm also so surprised you can't get the gene testing.  I have only one cousin besides me in our family that has had BC (she too is young-- in her thirties like me).  I saw a genetic counselor who said I was a definite candidate for the gene testing.  I had it done and my insurance (BCBS) covered it all.  I am negative for both.  Maybe you should push someone about your testing, or see a geentic counselor? If I'm not back later...  Happy New Year Jewels!  We're gonna kick some BCA in 2008!!",

OK, I've read all the posts since I was last here yesterday (man we are a big, chatty group, huh?).  So a few comments, tips that it all brouight to mind...  what's biotene?  I think D1, you are using it orally?  I've not heard of it and wonder what to use it for and where to find it.  My onc recommends a mix of baking soda and water (1 tsp to 1 cup water), swishing 4-6 times a day to prevent mouth sores.  Sounds gross, but I'll do it anyway.  They said to start the day of chemo and do daily until all chemo (all rounds) are done; so for about 12 weeks for me. The ADHD comments brought a tip to mind, too.  My friend did radiation and of course was very tired from it.  Her onc (same as mine), put her on Ritalin while she was doing rads and for a few weeks afterwards.  She said it helped with the exhaustion-- something to keep in mind for those of you that have to follow chemo with rads. I also think I may start a journal-- someone mentioned this.  I write mass e-mails to friends and family and find it really cathartic and a great way to keep them up-to-date, but the journaling might be nice to look back on after this is all over.  Thanks for the idea whoever said it. I hope everyone waiting for test results, chemo dates, etc. gets some new tomorrow.  We'll all be waiting to hear from you about the news. As for me, 6 more days of work total before I'm out on leave.  15 days until I start round one, 13 until I get my port.  I've got a lot to keep my mind occupied.  My dad had a heart attack right before Thanksgiving and he's having his bypass surgery the 9th (the week before I start chemo)-- our family's a health mess, huh?  Anyway, I'll be thinking of him and hoping to get to see him before I start chemo the 16th.  Work won't give me a day off to see him, and he lives 2 1/2hrs. away (aren't they great?). Cheers, girls!",

D1:  Glad you got a good bill of health from the dentist.  I've heard people say the same thing-that their teeth look great after chemo b/c of all the extra mouth care we do.  I saw my dentist in Jan. right before I started chemo, so I won't see him again until July. Hope your bil does well off the vent. I've stopped wearing my rings for fear I won't be able to get them off.  So sad b/c I love my engagement diamond.  But you're right-this too, shall pass (just not fast enough for me!).  Last night my \"cankles\" reappeared again (in the morning it's my eyes, by evening it's all migrated South).  Major sock lines-eeewww.  Glad to hear that the energy level improves better than the swelling.  Tina:  Will have to remember that I can mix the tonic water with a little something extra!  Maybe I'll just start off that way... no sense in trying to choke it down plain if it can be jazzed up. Paula:  My eye twitching started with round one, but that time it went away after just a few days.  Each round after it got worse and more frequent until it was happening all the time and then both eyes.  It's more annoying than anything else.  It is better now that I'm done, but lingering enough that I still notice it daily.

I never really drank much before BC, but I figure a glass now and then certainly can't do any more damage than BC has!).  Anyway, Kimberly, I had crab and shrimp paired with a glass of white wine-Reisling.  Does that sound right?  It was pretty good, but one glass and I was loopy.  I am such a cheap date!  .My friend suggested that wine; I think it was a Chardonnay.  Maybe I'll get into wines more now.  My friend and I are going to try and get out more for dinner with our dh's (one of the life changes I hope to maintain post-BC).  I'd also had an organic white wine (Girasole Vineyards Chardonnay, Mendocino) with the dh recently-like that one better than last night's.   But I digress...I need to get out the week's schedule! January Jewels Weekly Schedule: Week of April 14-18 Monday:           Cathy-CA Round #5 of 6 (one more to go) Tuesday:           Free day! Nice that we can have one of these again! Wednesday:     Wing (Wendy) Round #3 of 12 for weekly Taxol                         CHJ Round #5 of 6 (one more to go) Thursday:         Last round for Julie, Tinalee123, and Donna1955 (AZDonna)!  Wow, so many at once!!  Congrats girls on this big milestone!  I don't have anything down for any of you after this-so this looks like the end of treatments, too, for all of you.                         LJ13 Round #9 of 12 (3/4 done!) Friday:             DanaC weekly TH                         WVGirl Round #6 (#2 of AC) *Kris60 starts her weekly T (round #1 of 12), but I don't know which day (Kris: please let me know!).  And LJ, are you back to Fridays this week, or did you switch to Thursdays for the remainder? ** Anyone else with updates or not included above... let me know.  This is the latest update schedule I have.",

(So if we went Fri.-Sun., it'd be less).  June is \"slow/off\" season there, so the rates are lower.  Here's what she said: \"Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs Resort in Phoenix is VERY popular and well rated.  AGAIN, an estimate........ 3 nights, including tax and service:  $240 per person. The nice part is, it's only 12 miles from the Phoenix Airport.........so if you didn't want the expense of a rental car, you could always take taxi's! AND, there are many more flights into Phoenix than into Tuscon!  My vote is a resort in PHOENIX!! More economical....and easier!!\" Check out this resort above, you can google it. It look nice and dh's 'rents have been there and liked it.  Also liking the following: Lowes Ventana Canyon (Tucson), about $250 pp The Westin La Paloma (Tucson), about $275 pp",

D1:  Glad to hear the good news about rads and your \u2018cation plans.  My nails are holding up well so far.  The nailbed discomfort is gone (for good I hope).  I only use the TTO here and there now-trying to use up the bottle since it was so expensive.  I've noticed my nails are pretty hard, but they still break a lot-and down at the bottom usually.  Crap!  I have some faint dark lines horizontally that seem to be growing out.  How are yours doing? LOL at your analogy to the robin!!! MY dh is a computer man (his job is PC tech support for a huge banking co.).  Thus we can only have Dell in our house-he swears by it.  I have to say I love all of ours and have rarely had a problem.  Their tech support is really good (though you could always just call my dh if you have a problem or question).  P.S.:  He hates Vista, and we don't have it. Carol:  I think a second opinion from a female doc would be a good idea.  How nice the ds has found Ms Right Now!  My ds (2 yrs. old) had taken to calling his 3 preschool teachers (who are all young and sweet) his \"girls\".  It starts so young... J Not at all surprised or upset about the DWTS results.  She is scary looking for sure!  Also not surprised with AI results, though I thought she was actually improving in the past weeks. SIS Kimberly:  Bravo on your philosophy!  Thank you for sharing such a poignant message.  I agree. I sent my card Monday, so you should get them soon. I love those Mac commercials, too! Julie:  Was going to recommend a gun safety class also, but read on that he's had it.  I think maybe dh should review it again with ds.  Kudos to you for making ds sweat to pay off the damage (absolutely should be done!). I agree with Kimberly-consequences to every action can be taught/learned. Maybe you can also set up some rules and guidelines for gun use-never in house, only when supervised by an adult, etc.  That way he can be monitored more.  I grew up in a family of hunters (my gf, dad, bro).  My dad was a freak about gun safety (and still is).  But it instilled some valuable lessons in us.  Glad your family powwow was a success. TexRN:  I've also noticed, a month out from last chemo, that my lashes and brows are on a mass exodus.  I'm afraid to touch my face these days.  It looks awful.  Just in time for my new employee badge!  I'll look stunning... The weight:  like everything else with lingering SEs... I want it all resolved now!  I've been pretty good exercising this week, only missed yesty and I was out and about a lot, so I think that may have counted for something.  The scale hasn't budged despite eating great, less calories/more veggies, and sweating.  I know it will take time.  But how is it that men can take a dump and instantly lose weight and women can literally cut off a body part without a change in the scale???  So unfair! OK, caught up! So yesty did not go as I planned.  Good news:  no blow up.  And I am proud of myself that I feel I really handled the whole thing without getting upset, and everything I wanted to say came out right and sounded professional (you all know how hard that is these days with our brains!).   Not really any bad news either.  But my boss basically did not accept my resignation.  Instead he offered some alternative scheduling options to keep me on board in some capacity (evenings and/or weekends).  I was flattered and stunned (and many other adjectives that my chemo-brain can't get out right now!).  So now I have to decide what to do (again!).  I know-good to have choices.  But my poor little brain can only handle so much.  He has given me as much time as I need to get back to him-no deadline, no pressure.  I know I will still be doing my new job for sure, but now I need to ponder this new possibility of keeping some time with my old office.  Good points:  much less stress in the off-hours, I can still keep up my NP license, I'll get to see my patients that I don't want to leave, and will bring in some more cash that we desperately need these days. Bad:  that witch OM will still be around (though I really won't see her at all in the hours he proposed).  Hmmm....  My boss also had to mention that they envision opening a satellite office in the town I live in sometime in the near future (2-3 years)... oh how I \u2018d love to do that! Well, as Kimberly reminded me... live in the now.  I'll take this one step at a time and mull it over carefully.  The ball's in my court!",

SIS Kimberly:  Glad to hear the infection is clearing up, but \"boo\" that it's not gone!  Slowly but surely... I didn't catch in your post-will chemo be on schedule despite the extra abx?  That's what I assumed after reading it all. You had one busy weekend, sister!  Nice to hear about the Relay-I can't wait to do mine in June.  I'm sure it will be emotional, as you described. About the daily port access-do they have numbing spray at your center?  Mine has one that freezes the skin (no needle used!) and it works great.  Just a thought-it would save you the extra stick for the lidocaine. Someone else mentioned \"the new world\" by Oprah (this thread or another?).  I'll have to read it soon.  Right now I'm reading \"the Secret\".  Sounds a lot like you and your positive spin on things. D1:  Welcome back!  Dd sounds like she had quite the sporting weekend with her injury.  Guess I should not be-moan the smaller scale traumas my 2 and 5 year old present these days!  The \"nip\" surgery for me is this Wednesday.  A little nervous \u2018cuz I'll be awake, but excited to be able to check off another thing done (you know how I like to check things off my lists!).  I tried to use my eyebrow pencil I got from the LGFB class (I wanted to see if I could pencil in my rapidly disappearing brows since I have to get a freakin' PICTURE tomorrow for the new job)... what a #@!* mess!  A cosmetologist I'm not!  I'm sooooo lacking in the beauty skills.  I'm just hoping they grow back in some semblance of a brow.  And I'm hoping the new employer will let me retake the photo (that will be stuck to my body for the duration of my employment there) once I am not so \"follicly challenged\" on my face and head! Next up for the day: breakfast.  Then exercise, shower, phone calls, do bills, and go to derm .appt (not necessarily in that order).  Hope everyone is recovering from last week's SEs and is gearing up for the rounds this week.",

I was down at Rehoboth Beach yesterday with dh.  We went outlet shopping and it was a beautiful day, though I didn't get as much as I usually do-just didn't find much that I liked.  Afterwards, went to my primary doc (GP), as I'd been awakened Thursday night with pretty intense ear pain (and I seem to have a high pain tolerance these days, so this was a little concerning).  Anyway, I have an ear infection-she put me on some abx.  I have absolutely no hearing in that ear now, and it is just ringing all the time.  At least the abx seem to have dulled the pain, so I know they are already working.  But I have no clue where it came from.  It's pretty unusual for adults to get ear infections, especially without any preceding cold or allergy sx (I've had no illnesses recently).  I'm trying not to read into it much, but I must admit I am more than a little freaked out.  To top it off, I have been exhausted for the past 24-48 hrs.-I'm hoping that's just from all the activity recently combined with the infection, but again-I'm freaked out!  So my question, ladies that are done with chemo, is how do you not obsess over things as signs of recurrence?  I was never a hypochondriac, but I feel like my body has betrayed me, and thus I can't trust that \"everyday\" things are not something to worry about.  I hate feeling this way, and I know if it was one of you, I'd be able to rationally answer this, but it doesn't work when I try to talk myself down. I've read all the posts, so I know most are doing well, or hangin' in there. Dana:  My heart just goes out to you.  I was so distressed after reading your post.  But here's my thoughts now that I've recomposed myself.  First, no change is better than things growing or new spots appearing, so have faith that the TH did do something (it held your tumors steady)-just not enough, or the effect you'd have liked.  Secondly, there are still things they can try.  I'll be curious to hear what you're doing next with the Tamoxifen, as I suspect it's our friend HER2+ that's the culprit here and really needs to be stopped.  The latest research has found that using herceptin in combo with some other drugs is very helpful for HER2+ cancers that do not respond to herceptin alone.  They've found that other drugs can effectively block HER2+ cancers' receptors (herceptin only works on one type of receptor I think, and there are multiple).  I know a woman who is doing very well with Xeloda and herceptin.  Do not give up fighting or resign yourself to defeat when there's still many options for you.  I am praying for you and know you have the spirit to keep going.  Huge (((HUG))) from me to you. Maz:  I thought of you yesterday and hope your goodbye to Val was filled with some good memories of her. Finally, I'd like to post a list of Jewels who are still going through chemo to keep them all foremost in our thoughts.  Many of us have finished completely, or have moved on to our next step in treatment.  I know these Jewels are feeling \"left behind\" at times, but you are not!  I'd like to recognize you gals now and what you are still doing: LJ13: finishing up weekly T x12 (on #11 this week) WVGirl: finishing AC x4 (has 2 more to go) Deb102307: finishing AC x4 (has 1 more to go) Golfer779 (Carol): finishing CMF x6 months (has 2 cycles more to go) CHJ127: TC x6 (has 1 more to go) Cathy-CA: TCH x6 (has 1 more to go)             Peg1212: TAC x6 (has 1 more to go)             Kris60: finishing weekly T x12 (on #2 this week) Sheebas: AC x6 (has 1 more to go) Wing (Wendy): finishing weekly T x12 (on #6 this week) DanaC:  will start new tx soon Keep on blazing those trails girls!  The rest of us are pulling you along!",

OK, about ds's tattoo...  first of all, I think it's great that he told you (my step sister at age 16, went to a tattoo shop, lied about her age, and got one by herself.  She then proceeded to try and tell her mom and my dad that it wasn't a real tattoo, which they believed until the day they saw it again looking just as good as it did before!  BTW, she now has 3-4 tattoos now and wants more. She's 25 now.).  Secondly, there are worse things he could do (pierce some obvious body part); tattoos on the calf are covered by pants, so when he's a working adult someday it won't be sticking out somewhere \"unacceptable\".  Thirdly, you can do this together-meaning find a reputable tattoo shop that's clean and does nice work and go with him when he has it done.  Lastly, a \"mom\" tattoo is sooo much better than the name of some girl.  \"Mom\" will truly be a woman he loves forever and wouldn't need to have removed.  You could even have him sketch out what he wants it to look like, so you have a better idea of what he's looking for.  Also, have him do some \"research\" about tattoos if he doesn't know a lot about them as a condition or precursor to getting one-what to look for in a good shop, how long they take to heal/care for them, infection rates, cost, etc.  If he's really serious, he'll probably do the \"extra work\".   I think you should sit on the idea for a bit, but if it were my son I'd seriously consider it if it's really what he wanted and actually had the cajones to tell you. (And maybe it's hard for me to say, my ds is only 2.  But this is what I think I'd do). Just read D1's post, and she has some good insight, too.  Having him sketch out his idea might be good to do. Julie:  Yeah, I think a bicep tearing off it's insertion point is pretty serious.  I don't know that I'd weigh function of my arm vs winning a dance contest.  But I don't know enough about it to say for sure.  We'll have to stay tuned until next week's show... Good luck with your meeting.  Remember there are always 2 sides to every story, so don't panic about the \"cut\" until you hear what it's all about.  Let us know how everything goes. Oh yeah, Paula did look like an idiot (again).  I wonder if she's for real.... D1:  LOL on your take on DWTS Shannon and Derek.  OOO la-la!  And guess I should be happy to have some hair, huh.  Not thrilled with the dark color (It's even darker than what we buzzed off-I looked at some \"saved\" hair that my dd put in a baggie from that day.).  Guess I can color it when it's long enough, or maybe I'll like the \"au naturel\" \u2018do when it's longer.  Who knows! PALady:  WOW!  You're almost done with rads-that's great!  Glad you're doing so well with it and your skin is holding up, too.  Anything after that, or are you Done (capital D!) then?? Have a great day Jewels.  Gonna go walk and then get ready for my appointments.  For those that watched AI results... no shocker to me on last night's \"bootie\".  She had to go!  Still a little riled that she made it farther than Carly.  I honestly am not enthused about anyone left.  I hope David Cook wins it though.  Something about David A. annoys me, Jason looks and sounds like he should be stoking a doobie, and Syesha is good but I don't think has enough \"uniqueness\" compared to the David C.",

Tina:  The recipe from your SP sounds yummy.  What a great idea! Carol:  Thank God for helmets!  Can't wait to see what my ds will be into when he's older... will cause many gray hairs for me I'm sure (hey, at least I'll have some hair then).  Dh played ice hockey, football, and baseball, plus he golfs so I doubt my son will be doing anything dull. Paula:  Don't feel bad, I haven't gotten my act together yet to send my poor SP anything yet either.  I have ideas, just need time to go shop.  I'm sure our SPs will be happy when they get something regardless of the wait. CHJ:  Glad to see you're back over here.  I lurk on the TC thread still, but spend pretty much all my time here now since I'm done chemo.  Congrats again on finishing, and on your upcoming big move! Dana:  Good to see your post and glad to hear school is continuing for you.  I guess it's also good to have a break from chemo for a few months??? Not sure about how you feel about that... D1:  I am surprised that my energy level seems pretty good these days.  Don't know if it's my age, or the fact that I'm almost 8 weeks out from my last tx now-but it's nice regardless.  The only thing I notice is that I still get winded when walking real fast or going up a lot of steps.  I'm sure it's b/c my RBCs are still low.  And so crappy--- I still can't hear out of my ear!  I have to call my GP for a follow up appt.-on my list of to-dos.  While we're on the subject of recovery... how are your nails and hair status?  I never did have any nail issues.  I just notice some horizontal lines as they're growing out.  I lost my brows completely at about 6-7 weeks out, but they're starting to grow back in now.  Lashes went almost completely (about 5 on each eye now), but I do see some new \"sprouts\" coming in.  Hair on my head is getting there... not enough for me to ditch the wig yet, but I have hope... That's it for me tonight Jewels.  Going to go watch the tail end of AI.  As for DWTS, I think Marisa's next. Oh, I got my PS's gift today (how could I forget that?!)-so cool.  She must know I love to eat (did I put that on my card?  I should have!).  It was a package of gourmet pasta and sauces, and it has a recipe in it, too with a wine suggestion.  No, it's not Kimberly (I don't think so at least unless she got really crafty with the return address!).  I think I know who it is, but not positive yet, so I'm holding off on guessing for now.  But, thank you SP-I love it and can't wait to eat!!! Have \"off\" tomorrow-not really.  2 meetings for the new job, another lunch, and then a meeting with my \"old\" office.  Whew!",

It was just nice to spend the day with her hanging out.  Tonight dh comes home.  Will be nice to have him \"back\".  Tomorrow the kids have their end-of-the-year picnic.  They are both so excited.  Dh and I are both going for a little bit.  My new job is letting me come in late since I've already stayed late several times since starting. Carol: Oooo!  A massage sounds so nice.  Enjoy! And you're definitely not the step-child of the group!  Think of yourself more as the \"unique one\"-you have to forge a different path! Kris: It does suck when the leg hair starts coming back in.  But it does mean the head hair is close behind. Therese:  I think my PS said it takes 2-3 months for the implants to \"settle\" into place.  They'll still be pretty perky though I've found! I have found that multi-tasking is a thing of the past, too for the most part.  Now it's one or two things at a time at the most!  Not sure, like you, if it's I can't or I won't. LJ:  Glad to hear the good news about your scan.  I hope your surgery goes well. Kimberly:  I can't wait to hear about your spa trip to Sedona-that's something I'd like to do.  Maybe if it's really nice we could have our Jewel Gathering there? Hmmm... plans for the \"first\" paycheck-get some debt paid off!  So unexciting, I know.  But trust me, I've bought myself some things here and there. Sucks you have to have drains after your exchange.  Is it because of the contouring? I did not have to wear a sports bra after my exchange.  I wore my camisoles with the built-in bra top.  But with your drains, you may have a different plan. Tina:  Glad your exchange went so well.  Wait until you can buy new bras! Gotta get the rugrats ready for bed.  Later gals!",

Ds loved the bus ride there-his first--they could've just taken him and his class on a bus ride around town!  He actually got on a pony, too, which is a huge step for him-he was afraid all the times we tried before.  I just loved being there and taking it all in.  Another one of those glad-I-am-here days! Saturday was gymnastics with dd in the AM, and our thank-you party for her friends in the afternoon and evening.  They had a great time.  We played outside most of the afternoon-it's been gorgeous here the past few days (another reason why I haven't been inside on the computer at all).  The girls had pizza and pink lemonade.  We made smores for dessert.  I felt really good letting the other parents have a night out after all they did for me during chemo. Dd and I also got the rest of our flowers picked out yesterday.  I hope to plant them tomorrow.  Today, we were all over the place running errands, getting gifts, buying shoes, and went out for ice cream with the kids after dinner (crab cakes that dh made). Tomorrow will be house cleaning day and getting ready for another busy week. And BBQ-ing some burgers, of course.  This Wednesday is dd's preschool graduation.  I'm also seeing the ENT specialist about my ear on Tuesday-still can't hear.  One of my colleagues is having her baby (C-section) on Wednesday; her second, a boy.  Her first was a girl.  So, I'll have to stop by and see her Thursday; I got her the cutest little boy outfits today while I was out shopping.  Friday dh leaves (again) for a 2 day golf tournament down at the DE beaches.  At least this one is a shorter trip, and closer to home. It would take me forever to post to everyone from all the days I've missed (I've read all the posts, of course, just not going back to shout out).  But glad to hear the Jewels are recuperating from surgeries, keeping tabs on our missing \"Gems\", vacationing, and generally keeping busy! Paula:  Thinking of you and dh.    I can't imagine what you're going through right now...  ((HUGS)) D1 and Kimberly:  Can't wait to hear about the \u2018cations! Carol:  Congrats to ds on passing his driving test!  That's such a huge step.  And great timing with the new job for sure.  Hope your walking goes well, also. Sheshe:  Happy 49th B-day! I didn't know, and it wasn't in my notes... sorry! Dana:  Good to see your post and that you're still forging ahead.  I hope your tx go well and you get some good news soon. Jenn51:  I can hear your distress in the tone of your post.  I hope things get better for you.  I've been thinking of you and wishing you happier days ahead. Before I sign off... the list (of course, I couldn't forget it)!     January Jewels Schedule: Week of May 26-30   Monday, Thursday, and Friday:  No treatments! Tuesday:           Kris 60 #6 of 12 weekly T Wednesday:     Wing (Wendy) #9 of 12 weekly T                         Golfer779 (Carol) starts #6 round of oral/IV (one more IV to go after this!)",

In fact, she said to come back in about 6-8 weeks to see where we're at then, but it looks like I may have enough for a pixie style by the end of the summer.  Plus we'll do some color then (I haven't decided on reddish brown, or back to blonde yet; dh votes for blonde now).  She also trimmed up my red wig again today; the bangs in my face were driving me nuts.  And I bought a conditioner so the new hair is stronger as it grows.  AND I treated myself to 2 new nail polishes.  Overall, a good day in the appearance department! Saw my GYN today, too (and yeah, I actually worked somewhere in the midst of all this).  She is just the best... love her.  Anyway, we were chatting so much about my boobs and new nipple, and new growth of hair \"down there\" (D1, you'd love the way she talks!), the visit went by fast.  She's trying to recruit me to do a 5K walk next Mother's Day in Philly.  Forgot to ask her about a bone density scan.  Don't know if I really need one b/c I'm young, but I know chemo takes a toll there. I'll have to call her tomorrow.  Anyone know? D1:  Had to laugh at your painting everything white.  And your description of cleaning after the cleaning lady-that sounds like me.  One of the reasons I'm hesitant to find someone.  Everyone tells me my \"dirty\" house is cleaner than their \"clean\" house, too. Loved your tats info-I only know how to take care of infected ones.  Never done the deal from the start.  It's actually looking OK today.  Maybe I WILL get another someday... Jenn51:  Sorry to hear about your restless legs.  That sounds like a major sleep disrupter.  Glad the storms did not hit you hard.  We escaped the tornadoes and bad winds, just had a lot of heavy rain.  Unfortunately, it didn't do much for the heat.  It'll be 90s here by the weekend with some good ol' DE humidity! I hate beets, too.  My parents said when I was little I used to spit them out on the walls!  I still feel that way as an adult... Carol:  Hoping your belly's improved today.  I am happy to report I have successfully plugged myself up (probably to the point that I'll need miralax by the weekend), and I could eat a little today.  Always something... Congrats to your dh on the job offer.  Always nice to move onward and upward. Julie:  Yes, I had the nipple made first.  Waited about one month to heal, then she tattooed the color on it all (this really creates the areola look).  Overall, very easy 2 steps. Cathy-CA:  Thanks for the boysenberry report, and the nice info on hair growth.  Can't wait to ditch the wig.  I'm just not ready yet with this little bit I have. Kimberly:  Sounds like that nurse's baby was a big boy despite being early.  My ds was 4 weeks early and he was 6-7. Good luck tomorrow.  I'll be thinking of you and hoping you get a nice set of tatas! Paula:  Totally think you need to have a cleaning lady right now.  Would take at least one task away while you have so much to focus on.  I agree about \"not borrowing trouble\", too.  I hope you and dh will get some positive results.  You are in my thoughts often these days. Tomorrow's my Relay of Life.  I'm pretty excited.  And happy to report, I had the highest internet sales for our relay.  Pretty cool.  I think I've raise about $1200 so far.  Pretty good for a gal who's only ever sold GS cookies as a kid!  \u2018Night Jewels.  Will be back sometime this weekend.  I hope to get some pictures tomorrow night.  Will try to remember to get a \"head\" shot of the growing hair while I'm at it.",

Kimberly:  Sounds like one packed weekend.  Love reading about your escapades.  Yes, the kids made dh some stuff at preschool.  dd made him a fish card with some red, gummy fish attached in a decorated baggie (he actually loves that candy, so he was thrilled).  ds made a CD case that has his artwork and picture on it.  They loved giving him the stuff and could barely contain themselves until Sunday morning. D1:  How nice of your girls to treat dear dad to some cooking.  Always a way to make him happy.  The shirt is a cool idea, too. I've thought about the tats redo by a \"pro\".  Will have to see what my ps says/does at the next visit when I may be able to get he to do some touching-up.  Could always get the nip done with something more exciting by a tat artist!

PALady:  Keep us posted on you bil.  I hope he responds well to his tx. LJ:  Get thee to a physical therapist, woman!  Preferably one who specializes in BC therapy.  I found it to be extremely helpful for my post-surgery cording and went 2-3 times a week for about 8-10 weeks.  I have great ROM now and only occasionally need to stretch it out. I used the wall walk exercise a lot (walk you fingers up the wall as far as you can each time until your arms is straightened).  Also did a lot of this one:  lay on the floor on your back, lift arms above you and over your head, try to touch/lower hands to the floor.  Or: lay on floor on your back, lift arms at 90 degree angle to floor/body, lower hands to forehead (gradually work your way to hands on your chest, pushing elbows downward towards the floor). Kimberly:  hmmm... The \"drought\" must be extending all the way to the East coast as evidence by me and D1!  Maybe when you wake up in the middle of the night next time, you could give dh \"a little\"... would make him happy, and may help you fall asleep again!  (Just a thought-worked once for me; and I do stress the ONCE).  \u2018Night Jewels!!",

And to top it off, dd's dance school pissed me off, too!  I had to call 2x, and e-mail 2x (over the past week) before I finally got a response tonight about her next class level this fall.  The class was supposed to be Friday evenings (after she polled all of the parents about which time and day would be best).  It's now Wednesdays at a time we can't make. WTF??!!  Is it me today???  I'm in such a pissy mood now!  Guess I should go to bed and start over tomorrow.  I have my DEXA and MUGA, but will try to check in later on (hopefully in a much more pleasant mood).  Sorry gals for the kvetching tonight :)",

It looks like we've been busy on here, so I'll just get to my shout outs. Happy Birthday and welcome back SIS Kimberly!  I love the picture of you and your twin.  So jealous you have blonde fuzz growing.  I can't believe how dark my hair is coming in.  No offense to the brown haired Jewels, but I liked my blonde! BTW, thanks for the postcard! Cathy-CA:  I have to say that since I went back to work, I have fallen off the bandwagon with exercising-always my downfall.  Just not enough time in the day.  But I guess I am going to have to figure something out.  We have a walking trail at work in the hospital; I'd like to try and do it at least twice a week.  I also looked into a personal trainer at our YMCA... I may do 3 or 6 sessions just to get some insight and try to go on my Wednesdays off. My onc called back (well, his nurse did) and said my MUGA is \"normal\".  I guess since the EF is still over 50% they aren't concerned... but I am.  I have some questions for my onc when I see him this week.  Can't believe I haven't seen them for 12 weeks!  At least as I've had time to process things, I have calmed down somewhat.  Patty:  So good to hear from you.  Yippee on the negative BRCA testing and also being done with rads!!   What a great night dh had for you-way to go dh!! Hoping Vettesis does well with all her txs. D1:  I read your LE posts... and what can I say but it sucks and I feel for you.  Just not fair to have to deal with that forever.  And you still have your humor through it all... that's what I love about you! It seems like you were a cleaning freak again... I should just have you come visit, would save me money on the cleaning service! And you are so right about how it seems sad that it took BC for us to start giving ourselves some attention (me included).  But better late than never, and I find that I have been much happier in general since I started \"thinking about me\" more.  Ugh, just read about your toenail!  WTF... it's so late for that to happen now! Carol:  Yes, it's all just another reminder of what my body's been through.  I think the hardest thing is that it was a reminder... I was having a good time trying to forget it all, ya know?  Made another appointment to talk with my awesome therapist since I haven't seen her since the beginning of May.  She said the 6 months after would be the hardest.  LJ:  Hope your rads sim went well and your arm isn't stuck in that position.  OK, just read that post and it sounds like it sucked... sorry! Thank you so much for your words of wisdom on my tests.  I think I tend to freak out a little bit at first, then after I calm down and process (plus read what everyone here says!), I feel better and get it all in the right perspective.  I don't think my onc is going to stop my herceptin, but I'll see what he says on Tuesday.  And I think having a personal trainer cater to my needs will help me get all the aspects I need of a good workout-cardio, weights, and endurance.  Deb:  Hope you had a good b-day.  Nice to see you \"back\".  It sounds like its been a busy few weeks for you, and I hope things get back on track for you.  I think getting involved in things like you mentioned will help.  Sorry we have another Jewel that has LE!  Paula:  Congrats on finishing your txs!  I hope dh does well with his-keep us posted.  Julie:  Hope you don't spend the whole weekend cleaning puppy pee and poo!  Those pics are just too cute (I checked them out again to show dd). I would love to have the Jewel address list and birthdays, too (I only have a few).  But I'm thinking that since this is a public forum, it probably wouldn't be wise to post it all here (yes, I'm a safety freak).  Maybe we could \"snail mail\" them, or send via e-mail? Sheshe:  Great post!  Glad to see you back.  Some good news for you... I had gained 15 lbs from chemo, and here I am 14 weeks later and it's all gone but 3 pounds.  I didn't really do anything except move more and eat less.  It'll get better as time goes on.  And you're so right... everybody's come through this ordeal changed and probably stronger than before. Carla:  Hope you get good news from your MRI and MUGA. Not much going on with me.  The kids seem to have recuperated.  Fevers are just about gone-tomorrow should be 24 hrs. without one.  While they were at swim class, I worked out on a Precor for 20 minutes and got the forms for a personal trainer.  I should be a nice challenge for them! Dh went golfing today while I held down the fort-did the mundane tasks of laundry, bills, picking up somewhat, making dinner, etc.  Tomorrow's my day.  My new co-worker is having a Silpada jewelry party.  I hope to find something nice and sparkly!  The kids are sleeping, dh is is grocery shopping.  I'm gonna go read now that I've checked things out here.  Life is good! For the week ahead:  just Kris 60... #11 of 12 on Tuesday!  One more to go, and then all the Jewels will be done with chemo!",

Carla:  Glad to hear your good news about negative nodes. I think you are right that you could make it on your own if that's what you decide to do; you could make it work somehow.  As for your girls... my parents got divorced when I was 19.  It was tough b/c I'd had this image that our family was \"perfect\" growing up, and that was shattered.  But I did fine with some counseling.  As an adult, I am happy to see both my parents much happier apart than they were together, and I know they did what they had to do for themselves, which ultimately was also a better environment for me and my brother.  SIS Kim: Kudos to you for your healthy eating.  Your meals always sound delish.  I have to admit there are a few processed foods that still manage to make it into my house on a regular basis.  Even Sun Chips would be considered \"healthy\" here. D1:  My hair isn't growing that 1\" a month either.  I think I have a little over 1\" total for about 3 months' growth now.  (Sigh).  Glad to hear your anniversary dinner was yummy and dh noticed your \"look\".  And my comment (haha), wasn't supposed to help your hot flashes, silly... it was supposed to help turn up the heat elsewhere (I'm sure you knew this). On a more serious note, sorry to hear of you friend's passing.  Colon cancer just sounds awful (coming from someone who has enough GI issues).  I think a contribution to charity in his name would be lovely. Sista:  LOL on your sweatshirt story.  Only us BC survivors would find the dark humor in that Carol:  So cool ds was on the tube, even if he didn't do as well as he'd liked.   Hope Kent's home soon. Sheshe:  Don't be too impressed with me.  I only work 4-8 hours a week at my second job, and I do 32 a week at my other one.... So that's about what everyone else does normally.  And my dh is really good with picking up the slack with the kids.  I couldn't do it without him.  We are a team. I personally like heels, but those shoes look comfortable and the jewel is a nice touch.  I say if you like them, go for them! Julie:  sounds like you had a nice weekend, and a bonus of no kids!  I always miss mine, but do enjoy the few moments we get alone without them. When does school restart for you (sorry to bring that up, just curious!)? PaLady:  I'm not sure what the deal is with rawhide, but all my dogs (current one included) puke when they eat them.  Hope you got some sleep while ds and his friends were up all night.  Dd is so eager to have sleep overs... I'm not ready yet (she's only 5); I told her maybe for her 7th b-day party (and I stress the MAYBE). Cathy-CA:  Nice to see you again with your busy schedule.  I agree, there's no sleeping in sleepovers! GTG... laundry to fold.",

After Monday's escapade I think I did just have a virus starting.  I had a hoarse voice, cough, thing that developed.  Was pretty tired, but my work schedule doesn't help.  Today I finally started to feel a little better.  Tuesday was another long day.  Wednesday I worked again in the morning and had my herceptin in the afternoon.  Ran into one of my BC buddies.  She's stage 4 and doing great on herceptin and zometa.  Her tumors have shrunk.  I am thrilled for her.  Took a quick rest afterwards, then had to get the kids.  During dinner our dog had what the vet thinks may have been a seizure... poor doggie.  The muscles around his eyes and eyebrows were twitching, and his eyes rolled back.  Seemed to only be his eyes... weird.  His eyelids were drooping, too.  I've never seen an animal have a seizure, but have witnessed plenty of humans' and it did look like that, just with only the eye muscles.  Anyway, dh took him tonight to get checked out.  Sam (our dog) is 9.  The vet doesn't want to start any meds unless he starts having more seizures.  His labs looked OK, they'll check 'em again in a month.  He also has a \"fatty tumor\" that's developed on his side.  We didn't know it was there (I still can barely feel it), the vet found it tonight.  Of course, I wonder if the poor dog has cancer.  It's always something.  Today I had an all day class to become a CPR instructor, something I need for my new job but also something I've always wanted to do.  It was actually kinda fun.  Tomorrow night we want to take the kids to a carnival one of the local churches has.  Whew!  I'll try to catch up this weekend.  Life's getting in the way of my social life here!  Thinking of you all...",

As always, I have been burning the candle at both ends.  Worked all day and eve yesty, and again this AM.  Got home and dh was going to go out and fill my gas tank for me so I could sleep in today... and the battery in my car was dead!  Well, at least I made it home.  But no sleeping in today as we had to juggle schedules and rearrange our day with only one car.  Dh came home at lunch with me and put a new battery in (saved us some moolah).  He's back to work now and I'm just waiting for the clenaing ladies to come, then I'm off to do errands and pick up the kids.  Would've liked to have taken a nap this afternoon, but it appears I can't now as I have to leave in about a half hour... and I'd rather check in here!  2 birthday parties to go to this weekend with the kids, and I'd like to try to get to the Rehoboth Beach outlets to do some back to school shopping for the kids (yeah, we'll see how well I can organize that one).  Just glad I don't have to clean this weekend . Kim:  Hope your next adventure is a fun one (do I have any doubts?!?).  Did not realize there were quakes in CA, I haven't seen a paper in 2 days or turned on a TV in the same.  Maybe tonight I'll catch up on what's going in the world!  Glad to read from Cathy that the Jewels in CA should be fine. Cathy:  Thanks for the update on the CA girls and the earthquakes.  Sheesh, I can't believe I didn't know.  BTW, I am so impressed with your travel knowledge.  I hope to go somewhere exciting some day just so I can consult you!  My mom is going on a cruise (don't ask me which line... I have no idea) August 8 to some areas near Mexico, and I think the Bahamas.  I am much more of a land person.  My dad is headed to Alaska this weekend for 10 days; his dream trip that he finally decided to do.  My speed right now is NC's beach and doing nothing but chillin' in the sand.  Once the kids are bigger, I'll branch out I hope.  I'd love to see Hawaii, England, France, Italy, maybe Australia.  (((sigh))) Sherry:  Hope you find the dress and shoes you like for the wedding.  It's so hard to find that \"perfect\" outfit, huh? Julie:  Hope you're recovering well and can enjoy the new boobs soon!  Make that trip to VS when you're feeling better and dress 'em up! Paula:  Hope the trip goes well and dh is OK while you're gone.  It must be hard to go and leave him.  Praying the MRI looks good for him, too.  Carol: Sorry to hear rads is frying you.  Hang in there skin!  I don't know much about the AIs, but I do have a friend on Zometa and she says the infusions go easily for her.  She's doing that and herceptin currently. Well, I'm outta here.  Hope everyone is having a good day.",

Yeah, those first few days/weeks of returning to work are doozies!  Our bodies just aren't up to the new pace and it takes some time to get back into the swing of things.  Try to rest when you can.  As with everything, it gets better with time :) I get my herceptin every 3 weeks, so once or twice a month depending on how long the month is.  It's not bad, but I'll be glad to be done. Today's the last full day of 'cation for me.  Waaaah!  It's been beautiful here.  Tomorrow's the 9+ hour drive home with 2 kids and a dog in tow.  Not looking forward to it.  I'll try to check in again tonight cuz I'll be busy again for a few days after this until the kids are into their new school routine.  Hope all the Jewels are doing well.  I've thought of everyone a lot this week. Coming soon... August 30 was my first surgery and when I consider myself one year of NED; the other surgeries were for DCIS and reconstruction.  Wow, that went by fast.",

D1, I DO NOT want to get back to \"real life\" at all :)  Luckily, my house should be clean and the ladies come Wednesday anyway.  There's a washer/dryer here, so I did as much laundry as I could here, so very little to wash when I get home. Carol, glad to hear you're relaxed and refreshed, as well as healing.  Bonus!  I hope to get a 'cation with just dh sometime.  This one was really lacking on \"couple's time\".  No reconnection at all.  :( Gonna call it a night as we have a very long drive home tomorrow.  Back to reality...",

I have just a few more minutes as I'm at work.  But I have to comment on everyone's blue moods these days.  First of all, I too, feel it at times.  And I really get down when I think, OMG I'm only 37...  what will the next decades of my life bring?  I don't want to feel ancient at 50 (no offense to those who are there or beyond, but you get my idea...).  Secondly, my fabo therapist who is a 20+ year survivor herself TOLD me at the start that this timeframe (6+ months after treatment) would be the hardest.  Everyone, including ourselves, \"expects\" us to just move on and \"forget\" or push away the past year.  But she compared our cancer experience to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.  So I tell you all this for 2 reasons... one: our feelings are so normal (you all know that already), and 2: think about talking to a professional to help you get through it all.  I still see her from time to time, and it's a huge help.  It does not mean you're depressed! But it is a huge relief to just vent and cry and get it out with someone who will help you focus on getting through this in a healthy way and acknowledging what we've been through, but without dwelling on it (I hope that makes sense).  GTG.  Thinking of all my Jewels and wishing happy thoughts to each of you.  (((Hugs)))",

Saturday during the day I went on a tour of the Historic Houses of Odessa with my mom and dd.  I can't believe I live a mile away from all these beautiful places and only just did my first tour now, but better late than never I guess.  The houses date back to the early 1700s; some of them are kept up for the tour and others are actually lived in and owned.  I am not much for history, but I was amazed and plan on going back another year to check out some more.  It was one of the things on my list to-do since the BC dx, so I can check it off now! Thinking of Kris, Paula/ED, and Kimberly's sis.  Hope everyone is doing well and recovering from surgeries nicely.  I'll try to check in later for posts.",

I miss my blonde hair (so jealous).  I'm now brown and wavy.  I can't wait for it to grow longer, and I'll probably go lighter by the summer. Kris:  I remember I had my drain removed early b/c it clogged.  So every so many days I had to go in and have my \"third boob\" drained manually with a big ass needle like you.  I did this for about 3 weeks and then the fluid was gone.  You'd never know the skin was saggy/squishy there once I got the implants put in.  It looks fine now.  Hang in there! D1:  Hope your sports-filled weekend is fun.  My dh and mom watched Penn State get spanked the other night.  Dh hates the Eagles, so I'm sure he'll be rooting for the Vikes this time (he's from MA, so he's a Pats fan normally). Kimberly:  Yeah, it was some nice GI virus.  I'm not a fan of viruses since there's not much to do but weather out the storm of sx... and we can see how well my body does that!  (((sigh))).  GTG, I'll try to stay in touch better.  I love checking in here.",

Norma:  Glad to read you didn't have any clots.  That tamox sounds so nasty! Kimberly:  Hope you're feeling better soon.  And OMG, I can't believe you haven't heard of the Ravens.  I guess it's an East coast thing.  Their QG went to college with me. Carla:  If the elbow is from the computer use, I know people that have improved with the split keyboard and rollerball mouse.  I'm sure you can find them at any reputable computer store.

Cathy-CA:  For things to do in Vegas... I'm happy to do dinner Monday night, maybe a lunch too.  I'd really like to see Cirque du Soleil.  Otherwise, I'm happy to sit by the pool, maybe go shopping. BTW my port scar looks GREAT now ( 2 weeks afterwards)!  I hope your de-porting next month goes well.  It really was easy. CHJ:  Glad to hear your new onc news-she sounds wonderful!  I was so disappointed last week when the Ravens lost.  Honestly, I couldn't care less about the SB now, and I can't decide who to root for. Carol:  Yay!  Let's sit by the pool in Vegas and talk, talk, talk!  I can't wait to meet everyone. OK, after reading your posts about the effects of massage, I'm not too eager to get another.  I have enough GI issues. Tina:  No, the eyes are not a chemo SE.  Though no one can quite say yet what caused it.  I personally think it was from my really bad GI illness at Christmas time, or the lovely issues post-op port removal (cinder blocks, as I was dumb and forgot to take Miralax... I know TMI).  We'll see what this new specialist says this week.  I am seeing fine, so it's merely annoying having to go to more doctors!  Both my parents have eye issues though, so I'm being good and following through. Julie:  Another Facebook girl (and D1, and Kim, and Carol, and others I'm sure).  I'm holding back from signing up.  I can't keep up with my e-mail and reading posts here, though lots of my friends send me the \"invites\" to sign up. Wow!  Loved your before and after pics of your room.  The color looks amazing.  I suddenly feel the need to paint and redecorate J Paula:  Hope Ed is doing well.  I'll keep reading along to see.  I think the grief counseling would be good for you all from the sounds of it.  I'm sure hospice will be able to point you in the right direction. Kimberly:  Hope you're feeling better by now.  I swear I get over one illness, have a few days break, and then I'm on to another.  I've never been like this, so it must be from chemo hitting my immune system.  I feel like a little kid! Hope your sis is hanging in there with her journey through BC treatment. Liked your post format, so I followed suit with the bold names. Liked your words about Obama, too.  I am hopeful that things will improve, but know it will take time as you pointed out. OK, Miss Teacher... Homework for the Jewels?!?  I'm gonna have dh do it for me-ha!  He's actually good at that stuff and volunteered even before I got to your post.  Checked out Mandalay Bay before, too.  I really like what I saw. Sherry:  Glad you like your new job.  DE is still freezing, and what sucks is we have no snow here.  I figure if it's cold we should at least have some snow!  Hope you stay warm. D1:  I like your Vegas ideas.  I think it would be good to compare prices at a few places, and someone mentioned a package-that would be great.  Planet Hollywood does look nice though.  Just saw that the Miss America pageant last night was held there.  No, I didn't watch it... dh was flipping through the channels and I made him stop when I saw Vegas stuff!  I hope it won't be an issue if he's along in July as I see most are coming sans dh's.  I just don't want to travel without him (we rarely get to go anywhere these days); we've been so few places together and it's so close to our anniversary.  Hope you gals understand.  He wants to golf at least once anyway, so that's a few hours I'll have to myself at least once (probably more if I know him). Hope you didn't freeze your patootie off in DC last week.  I had no time at work to watch any of the events.  But 2 of my friends went, and of course our newspapers were berserk with Biden news and photos. Carla:  Good to hear things are better at home.  I agree with Kim's idea about hitting him up to go to counseling now. Deb:  I've also heard about the Mirage.  Hope you feel better soon. Norma:  Very interested in the info you read about BCP and BC.  I asked numerous docs about it and all said no, that didn't cause it.  But that was the only thing I've had consistent in my body for >10 years prior to BC dx. Hmmm.... Kris:  Glad to hear the drainage is letting up!  I hope they take your drains out soon then.  LOL at the tp'ing with the girls.  Sounds like it was fun payback J Wing (and Julie):  I'm a Vegas virgin, too!  My dh is more than happy to take care of that for me though... OK, I'm done!  Sorry this was so long, but I like to shout out after I've been gone for a while.  Kim... I'll try to find time to do some homework this week.  TTFN, Jewels!",

Feel pretty good about the port.  It is a bruised mess and sore, but I've only had to take Tylenol (yesterday, I actually didn't take any today so far).  I always ooze after surgeries and this was no exception-- what a bloody mess it was today.  I had to take the dressings all off down to the fresh incision, clean it up, and redress it.  Thank God I'm a nurse and had steri-strips and gauze on hand. Looks better now!  Well I gotta run to my appointments.  Good luck Trudy-- thinking of you today.  And of course, thinking of all the JJs also and hoping everyone has a good day.",

CarolC:  Any news from your cancer center yet?  Been thinking of you as I totally understand your plight... Cathy-CA:  Glad to hear #1 went OK.  How ya doin' today?? PALady: My steroid is Decadron.  I take 2 pills (4mg each) twice a day the day before, day of, day after treatment.  It's the only one I get.  It gave me some upset/acidy stomach which I took Zantac for.  It did not give me insomnia that I noticed and I took it 12 hrs. apart (7A and 7P). AZ Donna:  How's the tooth?? Carol (golfer): Love the pic.  Some day I'll figure out how to do that.  And about the miralax, I totally plan on getting it for my next round.  I could just kick myself for not using it since I prescribe it all the time and know how well it works.  Duh!  About dry mouth... I have been doing baking soda mouth rinses every 3 hrs. during the daytime and I use Biotene toothpaste and mouthrinse morning and night.  This really seems to be helping me so far (knock on wood!).  If I wake up at night I do an extra baking soda rinse.  Sista2:  I see D1 has your treatment updated already, I got it on my list now, too.  Good luck Thursday! Vettegal:  Calm down, girl!  You sound like me a week ago .  We'll get you through this.  I am doing the same TC every 3 weeks 4 times like you.  First of all, remember everyone is different in when they will get SEs, what type they'll get, and how it will be for them.  I went into round one telling myself \"mind over matter\"... I know I'll get some SE, but I'll be fine and will manage whatever comes along.  If things get too bad, I planned to call my onc, day or night, so I wouldn't suffer (my \"safety net\").  I mentally \"allowed\" myself 2 bad days and then decided I'd get back up again (so far I really think I had only one \"bad\" day).  Since everyone seems to feel bad around day 3-4, I decided if I was going to feel bad, that's when I would \"allow\" it-- this is all such a mental mindgame, remember. Ya gotta psych yourself up for success, girl!  OK, so having said that... to answer your specfic questions---  I take the same steroid you are taking, and had no problems sleeping.  But others here have offered some great advice that if you DO have trouble, try taking the second steoird of the day earlier in the afternoon.  Taxotere--  any RN worth her license should be giving the first drip of taxotere slowly (and any competent doc, for that matter) automatically.  This is a standard for that drug.  Mine was given very slowly for about a half hour, then increased 2 times until done.  It took about 1 1/2 hrs. for the taxotere infusion alone.  An RN sat by me the first 1/2 hour to monitor me and check my BP.  She told me to tell her immediately if I had any problems (I didn't have any).  They said when I do round 2, they'll only do 2 speeds, unless I have a problem.  As a nurse I'll tell you that most allergic reactions to drugs DO NOT happen the first time a drug is introduced, b/c the body does not usually recognize the drug as \"foreign\" until it \"meets\" it again (like on the second or third time).  It is rare and they should be monitoring you anyway each time!  D1's situation was scary, but remember, statistically there is always someone who will have a reaction (sorry D1 it was you, ya know what I mean, right?).  Side Effects-- ***Remember, everyone's different!  But most of us will not squeak by without some .  Just tell yourself, you will be fine, regardless of what comes along.  Have someone with you for a few days just in case-- it calmed me a lot to know someone (my mom and DH) was just there \"in case\" my head popped off or I puked like the Exorcist!  I also told myself that if round one went badly, it would only be one time of hell b/c I won't let it happen again with round 2.  I had some SEs the next day (I've kept a log) like constipation, lack of appetite, and food not tasting right.  Day 2 I felt a little tired and the constipation continued, I also felt hot and cold off and on and had a runny nose.  Day 3 for me was the worst so far-- that's when the body aches hit me and the fatigue was worst.  But I still managed to get up, shower, and put on clean clothes.  Overall I'll say the worst SE for me so far was the constipation.  Everything else was not pleasant, but not unbearable.  I did not throw up once (this was my biggest fear, too).  I've had some weird feelings yesterday and today in my pinkie fingers (probably the neuropathy that taxotere can cause), but it's annoying, not painful.  Metallic taste:  I had a weird metal/dirt taste during the cytoxan infusion.  I sucked on ice and it was barely noticable then.  The strange food tastes started the next day.  Chocolate tastes like crap to me now (so jealous of D1 and her choc. cake!).  Food in general just doesn't taste \"right\".  Water is OK if it's cold.  I hope this helps you a little.  We're all here for you and I'm sure others will chime in with their experiences and words of wisdom as the day goes on.  You just sound so much like how I felt, too I wanted to answer a lot for you (and we're doing the same stuff).",

Sheebas:  How frustrating for you to still not have a plan in place.  That sucks!  Maybe Canada is different than US, but here they will use a fresh port placed even the day before chemo.  Either way, I wouldn't worry too much about a few days.  Once they start the chemo it should take effect on those crazy cells-- remember, it's probably all been there longer than you'd care to think about so a few days or weeks is not much to cancer.  What status are you (er/pr, her2)?  This can make a difference, too.  ",

Carol:  So sorry to hear of your losses.  What a week it's been for you.  I'm really excited the shirts are on the way!  I hope to wear mine next week to my infusion.  I'll take pics, though I am completely computer-illiterate getting things other than words on here.  We'll see if I can post pics...

      "Content": "Feb 3, 2008 10:49AM - edited Feb 3, 2008 12:25PM by KathyL Hi Jewels!  So glad to read your posts-- it makes me feel better.  I'm having a waaahh day for sure.  I'm day 19 and the hair is falling out in clumps (it started about day 15 for those who were asking about hair loss, but each day more seems to come out-- this AM there was a groundhog in the shower!   hahaha, for Groundhog's Day yesterday.).  Strangely, I don't look any different when my hair's dry, but I know it's coming.  Tomorrow I'm getting it buzzed and shaping the wigs.  I've had enough of the shedding.  And yes, my scalp feels weird-- kinda achy and sore, but not painful.  I'm just feeling all around lousy today though, not just from the hair.  I'm tired and everything is an effort.  And I'm pale as a ghost (skin, gums, tongue, nailbeds, inner eyelids).  I'm sure I'm anemic-- anyone else notice paleness??  And now I'm starting to freak out that my H/H and/or RBCs will be too low for round 2 on Wednesday.  Anyone know what too low is?  My H/H was 10/30 last week.  I've already done the low WBC/ANC thing-- the neupogen shoulda taken care of that, but now I'm worried about the RBCs. This is crazy-- it's turning me into a paranoid freak.  I don't want round 2 to be delayed this week.  Sorry to vent... but dh is being a DH about this and you girls understand better than him.  Chemo is kicking my butt and I'm not happy about it at all.  I've only had one round... can't imagine what the other 3 will do to me. OK, I feel a little better that I got that out.  Shout outs... SIS Kimberly:  You sound a little perkier today.  Sorry round 2 hit you harder.  I knew you'd come around soon :) WVGirl:  Hope you had a nice b-fast with your bro.  He sounds cool.  Glad you have him for support.  Your dh really sounds to me like this is just freaking him out majorly and that's why he's acting like he is.  Was he like this before? Vettgeal:  I feel your period pain!  I'm STILL bleeding after 2 weeks.  NO wonder I'm probably anemic!  Stop the flood!!!  Oh, I'm on day 19 of taxotere/cytoxan/herceptin.  Cytoxan is different than carboplatin though I think.  My leg and armpit hair is there, but not really growing.  I haven't had to shave in over a week.  The head hair I wrote about above. D1:  Hope you had a nice visit with dd.  Mine's off with a friend today seeing the Hannah Montana 3-D movie concert.  They're 5. I'm sure they're having a blast.  Can't imagine the day she'll be a big college girl... she'll be starting kindergarten this fall.  I know the time will fly though. PALady and JackieB:  I used the Vaseline for about 2 weeks. I'll probably start it up again this week with round 2.  I also run a vaporizer/humdifier each night in our bedroom.  Both seem to help with the dryness.  And I use a saline nasal spray when it's really bad. Well I hope everyone gets some rest today and the SEs dwindle tomorrow.  Good luck to this week's Jewels with infusions!  Let's kick some more BCA!!!  Here's the list for the week: Wednesday: Round #2 for KathyL and Golfer 779 (Carol), round #3 for D1. Thursday: Round #2 for Camazur (Maz) and CHJ, last round (#4) of AC for LJ13 Friday: Round #3 for TexRN and Billsgirl I know there are others, but I didn't have any more specific dates.  Let me know so I can add to the week's list.",

      "Content": "Feb 4, 2008 04:55PM - edited Feb 4, 2008 04:56PM by KathyL Hi Jewels!  Good to hear from so many of you today.  I was off getting my wigs trimmed-- they look pretty good.  I wore my \"alter ego\" one to lunch with my friend.  She said it looked great. And then I was off shopping and enjoying a pretty \"normal\" day.  Tomorrow I start all the pre-meds. and get my check/bloodwork at my onc's.  Woohoo!  I'm ready for #2 Wednesday and I'm wearing my Jewels shirt then! CarolC: So sounds like food poisoning to me.  Replenish those fluids, girl!  About driving... I did not get Benadryl with my Taxotere so I probably could've driven myself, I just didn't.  I agree to call and ask what they'll be giving you so you know if you can drive or not.  If you don't have to drive though, maybe you shouldn't just in case (remember D1 and her reaction).  So happy to hear you got some good financial breakthroughs.  Whew! SIS Kimberly:  Glad to hear you sounding much better!  Yes, I'm getting Neulasta the day after this round for my WBC/ANC.  I think if my RBC, H/H counts are low tomorrow they give Procrit and iron; the low RBCs make you tired and pale.  Anyway, glad to see you pulled through OK.  Kris60: Good luck with your bloodwork tomorrow.  I'm going to ask my onc why they don't do a check the week after.  Seems to me it'd head off a lot of problems... Sharon68: Welcome back.  Glad things have been going well for you.  I can totally sympathize with the weight gain, and I've only done one round so far... Deb102307:  Feel better soon... rest! Julie:  So sorry #2 sucked for you still!  I agree to ask about Emend or Aloxi. If you aren't getting them, you should.  I hear Emend is used a lot with the AC.  Also ask for Zofran or Compazine on top of that-- you should be getting multiple antiemetics!  Maybe you also need them to give you a fluid bolus the day after, too.  And there's lots of financial talk on this thread.  We did a home equity loan and got a great deal.  The rates right now on that and refinancing a mortgage are super!  AZDonna: Hope your next round goes better.  I know much it sucks to have a setback in the middle of stuff.  Let me and D1 know your new dates when you have them. Vettegal:  What a sweet dh you have.  He's a keeper! Good night fellow Jewels!",

SiSKimberly:  Go for the red wig!  I LOVE mine (was blonde before) and have gotten a ton of compliments so far.  I haven't even worn my blonde one yet. Diane B:  I agree with Cathy-CA's info.  It really does depend on your type of cancer and some other factors like age, BRCA, etc.  I was 36 at dx, aggressive cancer (grade 3 and HER+), but largest area of IDC was 4mm, which they got all of on mastectomy. my BRCA1 and BRCA2 were negative.  My nodes were negative, too.  My onc said he did not recommend b/l mast. b/c my chance of having cancer in the other breast was only 1-2% higher than the general population and it would be considered a whole new cancer so not really a recurrence.  I did only a left mast. given those facts. Also look at how skilled your center is at doing mammograms.  Mine does digital and is very good at doing implants' mammograms (my right boob got augmented)-- so I feel very confident they'd pick something up early again if it happened (which I don't plan on having happen after this chemo!).  Hope that helps some :) PALady:  I got your date change for the weekly list.  I know D1 will see it soon to change the start of the thread, too. So nice to be moved UP to your original date... ",

And don't even think about feeling bad about calling the onc in the middle of the night-- that's what they get paid the big bucks for!  Hope you and CHJ will be on the mend soon.  For the future, temps in our bodies naturally go up overnight (I forget which hormone does it, Cortisol maybe?), and of course will be up if we're under covers or blankets even during the day.  So, get out of bed and/or unwrap for about 15 minutes, THEN take your temp for it to be more accurate.  That may be, CHJ, why your temp seems to be going up and down (of course it could also just be doing it from the process of the virus, too).  Jenn51:  LOL about the glasses story!  I almost tried putting my sunglasses on my head the other day.  Now I just hang them from my shirt front in my (new and lovely) cleavage!",

SIS Kimberly:  Good luck today!  Sheshe:  Sorry to hear about the changes you've had to make mid-tx.  I agree with Kimberly that you should definitely write a letter.  It gets things noticed at least.  Let us know how things go with the new center and when you'll restart your chemo again (dates). CarolC:  Both feet now?!?  So unfair...  I hope your new med. keeps the n-pathy under control.  Maybe some nice new fuzzy slippers?  How's it gonna be at work-- can you put your feet up, or cruise around on your chair? VZMom:  Welcome.  I don't have the same meds. as you, but will pass on some tips.  One thing's for sure... you are a busy lady!  You will find you have to slow down and prioritize or your body will force you to.  It was a very hard lesson for me to learn, but necessary to get through all this.  Keep in touch with support (whether it's us or somewhere else-- this is a life line and no one will understand what you go through better).  Round one is a \"test round\":  you prepare the best you can for SEs, but really will not know what you'll get or how it will hit until the first round is over.  Then you learn from it all.  Drink A LOT all the time-- you seem to be doing this already.  Find something for the constipation: you've read that here-- and start it the night before chemo.  The nausea seems to be fairly well controlled (with the exception of poor JulieK), by some IV antiemetic:  I get Aloxi and have to take nothing else.  I, too, am supersensitive to benadryl.  I have to get it now since I had a reaction.  I found that asking them to give me half the dose works (I told them how sensitive I am): the desired effect without knocking me out for the rest of the day-- try that if you need to take it.  Oh, the chemobag:  I pack: water, books or something to keep me busy for the 5-6 hrs. I'm at chemo, my I-pod, crackers or pretzels to snack on, and a blanket.  I take a different friend each time and have a \"chemo party\"-- yakking and catching up on things, being rowdy and having fun (might as well have a good time for the amount of time I'm stuck there)!",

PALady: I think after reading your post (and the ones before us) about the improvement with Claritin, I may try it this time.  I haven't had it too bad, but am so worried about #3 that I don't think Claritin will hurt.  It's on my list for the onc's Tuesday pre-chemo day. Maz:  Glad you've been doing well.  I see we're scheduled for the same day again this week.  Will be thinking of you while infusing! D1:  Thanks for the pep talk.  I needed it.  Now back atcha... you're on the homestretch, girlfriend.  You can do this!  Get that game face on and focus on the light at the end of the tunnel. Did you have cording in your arm?  My pt had told me that soemtimes when the cording improves after stretching it can suddenly snap (audibly!), when it starts to let up.  Maybe that's what you heard. My numbness and pain improved after some massage once my cording let up.  I'm trying to think positively for you... but agree that it needs to be checked out. TexRN:  I, too, thought I'd be spending a lot of this time off for chemo reading.  I love to read, and have a huge stack of books I'd hoped to fly through.  But I've found I have zero concentration.  I've been mostly doing crosswords, Sudoku, and reading magazines b/c they all are things that are brief, or can be put down then returned to later without needing recall.  {sigh!} Deb102307:  God, the chemo-brain is horrible.  I actually think I wrote to you about the Taxol now that you mentioned it.  So sorry for my flub!  At least it's still a milestone-- done with AC, halfway there to the end.    Pass your new dates on to me when you have them. LJ:  Puffy eyes could be a taxane SE.  I'm on taxotere and had puffy eyes with both infusions so far (though #1's were worse than #2).  Fluid retention is a SE of taxanes and it can show up in the eyes, or extremities (ankles, hands, feet).  I am super-sensitive to benadryl also.  I asked them to only give me 25 mg of it instead of the 50mg for my reaction I had (I told them 50mg knocks me out for hours); they did, and it worked fine to stop the reaction.  Ask for a lower dose next time!  Vettegal:  Can totally relate to your tub story.  There are definitely times you just wish you could go down the drain during this, huh?  Hang in there!  I know it seems like 3/27 is so far away, but it will be here soon.  My dd said to me... \"focus on spring; it's almost here and then your hair can grow back like the grass and flowers, mommy.\"  We WILL get through this, even if we have to hang onto each other to do it. Night, night Jewels...and sweet dreams to each of you!",

D1:  Girl, it sounds like time for a new surgeon!  What a DH!  Do you think if it was his you-know-whats swollen and painful like your LE arm he'd wait 6-8 mos. to \"see if it resolves\"?  Doubt it!  Even if it's not a \"surgical thing\", he should address your concern and point you in the right direction.  Sheesh!  Glad to hear your le specialist is helpful.  And by the way, even your rants are funny :) Julie and KImberly:  still gotta say, I love teachers.  It will be interesting when I'm the parent this fall with dd starting kindergarten (which I know is not much, but it's still school).  I'm sure I'll have some stories to tell you both. Tinalee:  Yes, see a PT!  I had my left mast. in Oct.  Had almost immediate cording with decreased range of motion and pain.  Saw a special PT for BC patients for about 2-3 months, and I'm great now.  Full ROM, and lifting light weights.  I only had 3 nodes removed, so I'm sure I bounced back sooner than some, but the PTs help everyone out-- it's so worth it.  I think anyone who's had BC sugery should automatically see one, it's that important. Dana:  What a long day!  Mine are very similar.  It forces you to slow down.  I agree with what everyone has already said-- go easy on yourself in the next few days, and remember we're here.  Round one is your learning round.   Cathy-CA:  You are amazing!  What a full plate you have.  I hope to be as active as you one day, really :)  Exercise, classes-- all sounds like fun.  I'd love to learn another foreign language someday.  I took Latin and French for years, and knew some Italian, Hebrew, and German also.  But I haven't used any of it, so most of it is \"gone\".  Someday... Well, I guess I should at least hit the shower.  Keep the birthdays coming.  I'm going to put them all in a calendar and then post upcoming days just like I do for the treatments.  Catch ya later, gems.",

Happy 45th to Golfer779 (Carol)!!  Had to check my notes, but today is the day!  Sorry I didn't give you all a head's up sooner, just realized it myself as I've been collecting the dates.  Lots of love, well wishes (with no SEs), and a long, happy life for you Carol!!  Monday:  OPEN DAY-- Nothing going on for the Jewels!  Rest and relax gems, and hope we're all diamonds, not sapphires for the day :) Tuesday: #4 for SIS Kimberly and Kris60 (that's 3/4-way for both!).  Dana will also be doing her second weekly round today I think(not sure about this, so let me know if it's the same day each week). Wednesday: second IV day for round #3 for Carol.  Round #3 for sheebas (Judy); halfway mark for her.  Round #3 for joteach. Thursday: #3 of 12 weekly T for LJ13.  Round #3 (3/4-way) for Sunshine 99 Friday: #5 for RN2Teach and Deb102307 (first round of T for each)",

Cathy-CA:  Hope today goes well.  I have had a cold 3 out of the 4 times I've done chemo.  I , too, am sick of being sick.  I don't think I've ever had so many colds before.  I hope yours passes uneventfully. Peg1212:  Sorry my chemo-brain did not pick up the change in your txs.  Let me know what dates you have after this week's as that's the last I have down for you. Julie:  My onc does not like to test \"too much\" (his words) b/c he feels it shows false positives and leads to unnecessary tests/biopsies.  He said he'll only do other tests if there's a reason (like bone scan for pain, etc.).  I've been told I will get an MRI at my year anniversary, and mammograms of the opposite side annually.  The onc I saw for a second opinion at UPenn recommended yearly MRI's for 5 years b/c of my age; I'm gonna push for that.  I will see my onc every 3 months for 1-2 years, every 6 months for 2-3 years, and then annually I think.   My breast surgeon will see me also on about the same schedule for 5 years.  I've already started doing my own exams monthly again.  I've written down to ask my onc about bone density testing.  I also have an excellent GYN that I see annually, and I know she'll follow things very closely, too. Deb102307:  Sorry for my faux pas!  Chemo brain struck twice in that post.  Ugh!  Hope the SEs are subsiding some for you.  I have the new dates down.  Thanks!  I know you're bummed about spreading out your tx, but I would try to focus on the fact that it will hopefully cause lessened SEs and less of a chance of them hanging around afterwards.  That's all good! Paula: Good for you, going topless in church!  (Where else could we say that but on here???) PALady:  I had BRCA testing done, and both were negative for me.  My insurance did cover it, too, despite no family hx other than a cousin (who also had it in her 30s).  If other genetic tests come out, which I'm sure over time they will, I may have others done.  I am a candidate to have free testing done for one rare type of genetic BC called Cowper's dz; I may have it done later this year.  I do have a friend that had DCIS and she came back positive for both BRCA1 and BRCA2.  She's since done a b/l mast. and oophorectomy. Joteach:  Glad you're no longer \"blue\". SIS Kimberly:  Glad to hear you're doing better.  So, I'm day 6 after last chemo.  Finally perking up.  I'm tired , but slept good last night and I think that helped.  dh and I put the kids to bed last night and sat in our Jacuzzi tub before going to bed ourselves-haven't done that in a while and it was nice.  I told him I want to go out to a nice dinner next month, just him and me.  Money's tight, but I think we can splurge once to celebrate.  Today the kids are home (for the whole week actually), and dh is off too.  He goes back to work tomorrow. So, my focus in the coming weeks is gonna be on getting stronger and enjoying the time I have left at home before I have to go back to work again (ugh!  Why can't I win Powerball???). Hope everyone's having a good day and the SEs are few.  Gonna post this, and then, as promised, the recipe!",

CHJ:  Good luck today. It's gonna be 60 today.  I want to get outside with the kids, maybe run some more errands today.  My voice is coming back, hopefully the energy level will follow and the cold sx will abate.  Tomorrow my dad is coming to visit.  Life is boring, but good!",

Anyway, geeting real nervous about next month and wishing I did not have to work the next 2 weeks-- I have so much I'd like to do before chemo starts.

I am on my computer a lot these days, but I think it will actually be nice when I'm home off work.  I'm taking a disability leave starting the day I get my port (Jan 14).  My onc wrote for 6 months, but I'll have to see what happens... I hope I'm not out that long, we'll be broke.  My onc is very supportive and basically said he'll write for whatever I want to do.  Anyone else having trouble with work though?  Mine has not been too supportive (though they think they are being supportive).  I am totally worried about being fired while I'm gone b/c I can't be there to work.  I am not working during chemo b/c my office is a very germy place (pediatrician office during the winter- yikes!) and it doesn't seem like there's a way to \"alter\" my job to make it safer.  I work directly with the kids being seen.  I am on my feet constantly without any breaks-- so I'd also be exhausted trying to keep the pace.  I have no time off left-- I used it all when I had my mastcetomy in October.  The work situation is a major stress for me right now-- almost worse than the thought of starting chemo soon. Suz:  Thanks for your words on the port.  It did help.  It's really nice that people from \"before\" come to offer tips and encouragement. Kimberly:  I knew about the EMLA cream, but they say they won't use it on a \"fresh surgical site\".  I'm hoping they'll use it all the other times after that.  I hope you get your dates soon-- there's that waiting thing again that we all hate!  Also, I asked everyone about the PT/OT (my PS, my, breast surgeon, my onc.).  It was my onc who finally wrote the RX and referred me to a group that specializes in breast cancer patients.  They are great... I got really lucky on that one.  So, I guess I'd just ask whomever you see next and push for the order.  It makes you feel so much better to see some progress and feel you're doing something towards a goal. D1/OLE:  You are amazing, girl!  I feel the need to at least try and rise to the occasion of not being a total wuss about this chemo thing after reading your posts.  You do more on a chemo day than I do on a regular one!  And your posts crack me up-- I am so loving your sense of humor and the details don't bother me at all (we nurses are a sick bunch anyway!  My family used to censor what I'd say about my workday at the dinner table).  Oh, and just for the record folks, I am NOT an onc. nurse (I do pediatrics), so all this stuff is not my knowledge base.  Please share details and stories! LJ:  Hang in there!  We are all behind you.  It is good to read your posts regardless of the day you had though-- we get the whole story good or not and that's helpful, too.  You can do this!",

So my shout outs: Vettegal: read your post and am so sorry to hear how crappy you've been feeling.  One positive to all the negative-- maybe in some ways it's better to get all the illness out now vs. during chemo.  At least you don't have both at the same time.  I hope you know what I mean and don't take that the wrong way.  Feel better soon! Welcome Trudy!  How many cycles of TC are you doing and how far apart are they?  I'm the \"secretary\" here and record a lot of stuff.  D1 will also post you at the start of the thread.  Crummy sisterhood to join (BC), but this group is fantastic and will pull you through.  D1:  See above (new member).  Plus, check with your insurance about wigs' coverage.  Someone else mentioned this I think, too.  Anyway, my insurance would give me $500 for a wig if I went \"in-network\".  The catch is \"in-network\" (finding a place can be hard, I was lucky and had a few to choose from), and only one wig per year... but it helped.  The place I got my wigs submitted everything to my insurance for me, I just had to give them my doctor's prescription.  I paid for the cheaper one myslef, but could claim it on my health flexible spending account (pre-tax money).  Hats, turbans, scarves are not covered by anything that I've found.  My health FSA account won't even let me claim them.  I think it's a little crazy b/c who would walk around bald in the winter without at least a hat-- I think it's pretty much a medical necessity unless insurance wants to cover us getting frostbite or ill!!! Billsgirl:  glad to hear you are doing well with SEs.  Way to go!  Also great news about BRCA- SIS Kimberly:  Have you tried Miralax for the constipation?  It's over the counter, but works really well and doesn't taste bad.  I used to prescribe it all the time for my patients (kids-- what picker clientele?  And they all took it.).  Now it's no longer prescription.  I have it in my arsenal in case Sennakot-S and fiber don't cut it for me.  If you can find it, the dose is one capful per day (17 grams) dissolved in 6-8 ounces of fluid (any liquid;  but water or juice seems best).  Good luck and here's hoping your GI tract gets a little happier this coming week TexRN:  Thanks for your hair story.  I don't know why, but i think that will be a tough moment for me.  Reading your post helps. Julie:   OMG!  As Deb said-- call your doc!!!  You need some IV fluids and some nice antiemetic like Emend or Aloxi.  The nurse in me is just wanting to come hook you up myself if I could!  At least your docs should know and be watching you very closely.  No one should be puking as long as you've had to suffer.  Insist on some action!  Then let us know later how you are and what worked Jenn51:  Good luck tomorrow with your port.  I am getting mine, too and will be thinking of you.  I'm more nervous about them sticking it for my chemo on Wednesday but I understand your apprehension.  The twilight anesthesia is nice and you probably won't even remember the whole ordeal.  If you're really nervous, ask them for some Xanax IV once they get your IV in-- it's good stuff and calms the nerves.  Ok so up this week: Monday: port insertions for me, Jenn51, and Trudy (newest Jewel). Tuesday: chemo round #1 for Trudy Wednesday: chemo round #1 for me, Camazur, CarolC.  chemo round #2 for D1 Thursday: chemo round #1 for sista2 and Jenn51, #2 for AZ Donna Friday: chemo round #2 for TexRN I hope I haven't missed anyone.  Please update me on dates for other up-coming surgeries or chemo rounds past your first one.  I don't have a lot of these.  See ya tomorrow.  Keep going strong Jewels, we're halfway through the month this week!!",

D1: as everyone said, you DO rule!  I am so happy to \"know\" you!  Your posting and pictures about your hair just make this all seem better and doable.  You look wonderful!  So sorry to hear about your bad marathon day at chemo-- from the grouchy doc to the taxotere reaction.  What'll they do for your next taxotere infusions?? Just curious.  I'm doing the same drug and also had no problems the first time.  So a little nervous about number 2 now.  My friend here in DE did Taxol and had a bad reaction with hives and coughing on her second Taxol infusion-- they decided to stop it and aren't giving her anymore now-- she's done with chemo.  She ended up getting 4 rounds of AC then 2 of 4 of her Taxol rounds.  She's on to rads next.  Anyway, I hope your next one goes better so you and your poor dh don't have that scare again.  D1, SIS KImberly, and Carol:  my poop partners!  Thanks for all your comments and suggestions.  They make me smile.  The Colace alone seems to be faring better for me-- less stomach cramps.  But lots of gas-- just about killed the dh last night with some of the \"clouds\" I produced!  Hahaha!  My onc's nurse asked if I had hemorrhoids and I said who doesn't after birthing 2 kids-- I've never been diagnosed, but I'm sure they exist.  Anyway, today is one small step forward at least, so thanks girls. CarolC: insurance cos are sure one big FUSE, huh?  I can't believe what a mess they made for you.  I have had to fight mine here and there over little things so far, but your story just takes the cake. I hope things get better for you.  Maybe some day when D1 is president, she can clear that stuff up for us :) Well, just briefly on me to end this post:  today is OK so far.  Mouth tastes funny, no real appetite (but I'm eating anyway), just feel kinda blah with no real energy, and I have hot and cold flashes going on.  But I'm hanging in there and making myself get up, go through the motions.  I think I'll just lay low.  I'll check in on everybody again later. ",

Posts on calcium and fluoride (I'll put in what I have researched, asked, know as an NP): for calcium all us ladies should get about 1000mg a day-- through food is best, but any vitamin will do also.  Don't take it all at once since we only can absorb so much in one sitting and the rest will be peed out and wasted.  I personally like Viactiv, but I've been taking One-A-Day Women's vits. while doing chemo for the other nutrients it has.  Most calcium supps. contain Vit. D.  For fluoride... yes, it's daily.  In the form of fluoridated toothpaste (like little kids'), mouthwashes (ACT is a good brand), or gels (Colgate makes one called Gel-Kam that I got at my pharmacy).  Just choose one form of fluoride b/c too much is not good either.  And don't swallow it.  It should be used, swished, applied-- and left on for about a half hour to a hour before anything else goes in your mouth-- I do mine before bed and just go to sleep. Carol: I'm so psyched about the shirts!  I'll be mailing out a check to you early next week.  You're the greatest for taking on that endeavor.  It really means a lot and I know it's something we'll all cherish.  I can't wait to show mine off at my next infusion. Well, I'm gonna go try and walk.  I'm still trying to move today, it's just slow going.  I also gotta find that tea you all keep talking about (Slow Move)!!!  Everything is slow still (if ya know what I mean) and I don't want to be birthing more cinder blocks this weekend!  Thanks to everyone here for keeping me going.. just reading posts helps :)",

Good luck today to Joan, Judy, Sunshine, and Deb3girls with their treatments.  Hoping it all goes smoothly for you as it should. Sista2:  So sorry to hear you are having the poop problem so many of us seem to be having.  What a true PITA!  For the future, since you don't like AJ and probably don't want to drink 30 oz. of it again... you can take 1 1/2 or 2 capfuls of Miralax to get things going if the one did not help.  Hope things keep moving for you :) WVgirl:  Your dh sounds like he's having some DH moments recently.  Big hugs to you.  I am pretty lucky that mine's usually a dh, but he does have his DH moments from time to time.  One thing I've found is that it's sometimes very hard for them to express to us that they are scared, worried, or afraid about what's happening to us.  I had to pull it out of my dh finally.  Maybe you can just ask him if that's what's going on.  Or say something like \"you haven't been too supportive recently (give an example like last night's behavior).  It really makes me feel _____  when you ______.\"  Fill in the blanks with whatever works for you... like \"it really makes me feel alone when you act like you did last night.\"  Tell him how you feel and what you need.  If he's still \"unresponsive\", I'd find a good counselor for you to vent to (plus us of course) just to help you through this.  You need to find a way to communicate with your hubby so he's more of a dh not a DH.  I'm sure deep down he wants to be helpful, but has no clue how.  You deserve hugs from him!  Good luck and keep us posted. CHJ:  Listen to your body and take it easy today.  Do something you want to do like relax and read a book or watch a movie. TTFN Jewels.  I'll be reading throughout the day.  Tonight's my evening with the monster children alone-- dh works late.  He's in a foul mood anyway b/c his job is screwing him over again on a promotion/raise. ",

WVgirl:  like the horses poem. D1: so glad you were out busy, not laid up with SEs!  Love the bald story, though when I first read it I wasn't sure which version of \"topless\" you meant.  LOL!  We ARE BC patients after all :)  OK, 5'9\" and 138 lbs. is not a fatty, honey!  But I feel your pain about the weight gain regardless. I feel like a big lump and really need to do something before I'm a candidate for the next \"Biggest Loser\".  Thanks for the details on round #2-- very helpful.  And constipation is way worse than gas for sure, to clear that one up!  Gas is no biggie: better to let it out and bear the shame, than hold it in and bear the pain my grandpa used to say!  hahaha!  Interesting about the hair.  I am starting to see some strands come off my head today, though no major exodus yet.  No loss on my arms or pubes yet.  Or my legs and armpits, but they are barely growing.  Weird!  I'm gonna be PO'ed if I lose all on my head, but nowhere else.  There has to be some benefit to hair loss (like no shaving)! Vettegal:  Hang in there.  Hope you feel better soon.  I'm waiting for chemo-pause, too.  I spotted all last week and this week have my period-- joy, 2 weeks of bleeding instead of one!  And not being able to use tampons really sucks! OK, back to the kids.  Only one more hour to bedtime and some peace.  See you all tomorrow!",

I'll add some \"nursing pearls\" to them, too (hope you guys don't mind.. I have no one to take care of but me, the Jewels, and my kids since I'm not working these days)... Note about Miralax: if you need a \"starter boost\" (cuz nothing's happened in a few days), you can take 1 1/2 - 2 capfuls instead of the usual one.  Vettegal:  Fruit has lots of fiber, so it can cause diarrhea.  Pectin (a fruit sugar) is another culprit also, so avoid juice especially if you have diarrhea.  Bananas are the exception, they can constipate.  Apples can go either way.  Applesauce has lots of pectin so it usually causes diarrhea.  I agree with Paula: my onc said to avoid fresh fruits when counts are low unless they can be washed very well b/c of the bacteria potential.  And my \"cocktail\" includes: Aloxi, saline, bendryl and decadron (added after my reaction), Taxotere, Cytoxan, and Herceptin.  I'm there about 5-6 hrs. LJ13:  Good luck with your MUGA!  I thought this was the easiest test so far.  And I hear herceptin is easy (v. little SEs).  I can't really tell what SE is from that b/c right now I get it with everything else.  But I hear the biggest SE is \"flu-like sx\" the day after infusion.  I don't experience any of that right now.  I'll be curious to see what if anything I notice when I'm just doing herceptin alone (by April). Jenn51:  Hee hee hee-- can't imagine being bald as a SE of PG!  I DID have some hair thinning though at the top of my forehead after I delivered my son .  My OB (and hairdresser) said it was from the drop in hormones. Kris60 and Wing:  Welcome to the bald babes club! Wing: That \"o\" drug is Zofran.  I love it, as I can't take compazine (allergic), but it IS very constipating (go figure!).  How low are your RBCs?  And what's your H/H (hemoglobin/hematocrit)?  Sometimes the oncs will give Procrit (a shot given once) to boost them and/or iron (pills taken daily for \"a while\").  I may be able to give you an idea.  PM me if you want. SIS Kimberly:  Glad you got your appliances!  It's kinda like having a new car: all shiny, and with the \"new\" smell!  I had a woman who's stage 4 tell me about the runny eyes and nose thing at my last infusion (our oncs are the same, and she said he told her about it).  Evidently it is from chemo, usually the taxanes.  They cause watery eyes.  The runny nose is actually the tears from your eyes coming out your nose.  Makes sense as they are connected at the tear duct area.  And I've noticed my runny nose IS very watery, not like usual \"thicker\" snot.  Sorry to be gross... but I found it very interesting.  I thick our bodies contain levels of the chemo drugs in our secretions for quite some time after tx, so the mucus membranes and anything the \"tears\" touch are affected--probably it's why your surrounding skin gets red, too I would think.  Maybe you can protect your skin with Vaseline or Aquaphor? So good to be back online!  Hope everyone has a great rest of the day.",

Dana: Oh sweetie... I am so sorry to hear your news.  {{((Big Hug))}} to you.  I'll be thinking and praying for you.  How do they know from just looking that it's liver CA and not BC on the liver?  I would think the biposy will tell you more and guide your tx.  We're all here for you... Well, off to get ready for today.  We got about 2\" of snow yesterday and it's still really cold.  I'm headed to the therapist's and then to the ps with my friend for her last fill, then we're going to lunch.  She gets her exchange done next month.  Catch you gems later :)",

I read all the posts but will just reply to a few as I am so pooped.  Know that you're all in my thoughts, prayers, and heart! sheshe: so glad the new cancer center and onc are great.  It definitely sounds like a good move for you :) vettegal: I've managed to avoid the heartburn and sleep problems-- hey, I gotta get a break somewhere with all my other drama.  I do take Zantac twice a day 150mg each time on the days I have to take decadron.

D1:  Yay-- you're done with chemo!!!!  A thought for you as you go on to rads. -- Both my cousin and friend who did rads swear by calendula cream... they put it on the hoot(s)night before each rads and had no burnt skin at all.  You can get it at health foods stores. Cathy-Ca:  Thanks for the info on herceptin.  It's about time they did that.  If you can find the link again, I'd love to read it. Kimberly:  I have one March and 2 April dates up next for you.

She died at home Monday, she was 48.  It's the first person I know of that has died from BC, and it's just hit me hard.  So tragic at her age, and it sucks that this awful disease has taken such a vibrant life away. And I hate to be a downer, girls, but I am just really having a hard time today.  She was the first person I \"know\" that has died from BC, and it's hitting me harder than I thought, espcially since I never really met her.  Plus it's made me stop and think... I hope to God that all I'm going through is working.  I don't want to be dead anytime soon.  I know there's no guarantees, and when God says it's time, we go.  But I'm just not ready to go so quickly.  How do you get over that nagging thought of recurrence??  Dana, honey please forgive me for all this... I know you are going through such a tough time right now with your cancer, but I gotta get it out.  I hope I don't bring you down. Cathy-CA:  thanks for the link.  D*mn, I missed that info by a few weeks, or maybe I could've just done herceptin.  I was wondering when they'd get around to that idea.  I guess in my case, it's better to hit it with all they've got now, and not regret doing chemo and herceptin. WVGirl: Congrats on the speaking offer!  Something I'd love to do if ever called on.  I hope it goes well.  You've got a lot to share. Dana: I'll bet the pain is from the biopsy-- they did poke into your belly and take out a few chunks of liver afterall.  I'd call if the pain gets worse, or if you feel weak/dizzy anytime today.  The greatest risk (of bleeding) comes within 24 hours after liver biopsy (I've assisted with many).  And while I guess it's possible to have sprouted more mets to bone since your PET, I doubt it's really that fast growing to have noticed now something that the PET didn't pick up-- extremely unlikely. Carol: Chemopause seems to have hit me, but I'll know more in the next week or so.  I was due earlier this week, and still no \"Flo\".  I am so regular usually.  And heaven knows I am NOT preggers unless it's an immaculate conception! Well, I gotta go get some food into me to take the next round of drugs for today.   ",

Many Jewels having a big day today-- hope everyone does well. D1:  Love the t-shirt story.  We DO rock!  Glad some of my comments were helpful to you.  Have a good weekend with college girl, and try to not worry about that arm for a few days at least.  Focus on the hot doc! And your great le spec. (OK at least that's shorter). Dana:  Hope you are doing OK as I'm sure the 'roid crash will be hitting soon if it hasn't already. ZZZZZ!  We all seem to be worried about you overdoing it.  A nursing pearl: you have to learn to take care of yourself first, then others.  It's kinda the same when you're a mom.  You are no good if you are burning the candle at both ends and exhausted.  Listen to your body-- you do not need to push through and be a martyr.  You have to practice what you preach to your patients-- take care of yourself!  I KNOW how badly you want to do chemo and school, but remember to put your body's needs first right now.  Maslow's hierarchy, girl (every good nursing student knows about that!): basic needs have to be attended to first!  You are just starting this crazy roller coaster ride.  Have a good, and sleep-ful weekend:) Cathy-CA: what a bummer... making truffles you can't taste.  Chocolate still tastes crappy to me too.  Someday, we can all eat again...I think when we all get together you are going to have to bring samples of your \"homework\".  Yum! Carol:  your cookbook sounds like mine.  I have one called the \"cancer survival cookbook\".  It's pretty good with the tips, and I've tried a few of the recipes in it-- not bad. I got the neupogen when I was in the hospital; it's short acting anbd fast.  It brought the 1.1 to 11-something in less than 3 days (about 3 shots).  Now I get the neulasta which is longer acting; my counts have all stayed normal or above normal now. Deb:  So sorry you are a blue jewel.  I think it's great that you get some relief here at least.  You have had some incredibly stressful thing happen recently.  Know that it will get better-- for every down, there is an up.  Hugs to you, and let the tears flow!

Peg1212:  sorry you found out you have to do 6 rounds now, not 4.  What a major bummer.  But like Carol said, focus on the fact that it is what's best for the future and you can do it.  Let me know new dates when you get them. Sis Kimberly:  I am seriously thinking of writing.  Do you have any idea of how to start-- like who to ask about it and how to get going on it?  I have some fabulous ideas flying around this little chemo-brain of mine.  But I don't want to start writing if there's no hope of getting published, ya know... too much work involved for us.  I have read of a mother/son (the name escapes me now) that have had bestsellers.  They writeunder a common pseudonym, and they don't live nearby each other.  They e-mail and call their story as they write it, and then get together at the end once before it goes to press.  We could really do this I think.  Lastly, making another call for Jewel birthdays!  I am the record keeper, and I need some more dates!  So far, I have: D1, JulieK, Donna1955, WVgirl, SIS Kimberly, Carol (golfer), Paula, and Dana.",

Vettegal: can't wait for the BB pic.  I gotta get my dh to take some of me in my wigs to post...   And oh, deja vu with the second reaction.  Sorry to hear about it-- our bodies must be super-sensitive.  I'll have to let you know what they do for me on my last round and if it works.  Did they give you any idea for you? WVGirl:  LOL on the dishwasher! D1:  so tell me more about your nails' status these days.  Mine have started to look kinda light purplish up by the nailbed-- almost like when you're cold, but it doesn't go away.  And I have noticed some horizontal lines there, too (My onc said that part might happen-- it indicates each cycle of chemo during the nail's growth; so that doesn't worry me too much).  But I have started having some tenderness to my nails now.  Freaking me out a little as I also do not want them to fall off and they still have to endure one more round.  nO lifting, just the color change and soreness. Hope you had a good weekend with cg... watch that drive back! LJ13:  yay on #3's success!  Sounds like you've got a nice doc there too :) Kimberly: Hope your Jazz and Wine was nice.  And I agree about the mind game with positive thinking.  But I'm also starting to think-- what ISN'T a friggin' mindgame these days :) Deb: Thanks for the words of wisdom with writing.  You're so right.  Vacation spots near me:  Poconos (in PA: nice for hiking and outdoors stuff in the mts.).  But I bet you'd also like it here in DE.  Our beaches, particularly Rehoboth, are great for shopping (outlet stores are awesome there!), all kinds of little shops, the boardwalk, great dining.  And not too far away from DE beaches is Bombay Hook-- a refuge/state park great for hiking, birdwatching, etc.  Plus, I could meet you! Our house is only 1-2 hours away from it all. Paula: Sounds like you had an awesome weekend.  Congrats on all the awards.  And the story about your student's tribute just sounds wonderful.  What a moment to treasure. OK, gotta get ds to lay down for a nap.  I'll be back to post the week's list. ",

      "Content": "Mar 11, 2008 06:36AM - edited Mar 11, 2008 06:41AM by KathyL Wow!  This is gonna be long.  I have some catching up to do on reading posts.  Yesty night was great.  dd and dh looked good and dd felt like a prima ballerina for the night complete with the flowers.  Her hair turned out awesome--tho' she had to announce to everyone that I had no hair, and was wearing a wig.  Hope to get the pics up in the next week or so.  Too cute to describe all these little girls dancing with their daddies!  ds had to get in on the action and he was up on the stage running around and twirling between dances.  Little monster boy!  Today I have 2 gfs visiting (and bringing more food--no wonder I've gained weight).  Will just be relaxing.  dh has a long week at work, so I'm holding down the fort. Julie:  Happy to hear you are doing well so far this round. Got my fingers and toes crossed for you...  you so deserve a break for once! D1:  Thanks for the nail update.  Mine are doing the exact same thing (sensation and purplish color) and at the exact same timing (one week after #3)-weird!  I guess all my good nail care was useless-well, maybe not if it saves them from falling off.  They are nice and hard from all the TTO and strengthener. Ears piercing--  Mine aren't crusty, but I did notice the piercing got sore/sensitive after this last round, and the lobe was red for a few days; only on my left.  I thought it was infected, or starting, but then it just went away and I didn't do anything to make it better.  I've always only been able to wear gold in my ears (was a pain as a teen b/c I couldn't wear all the cheap stuff), so I've had my hoops in the whole time.  My second piercing in each ear did not seem affected by all this. Cathy-CA:  What a cool goal!  I'd just love to see more than the states on my coast... gotta conquer my fear of flying first I guess.  And I'm married to a guy that used to be a pilot-go figure! Tinalee:  Better living through chemistry!  Hope you're feeling better today.  I put my little bottle of Zofran out on the counter with all the other drugs each round, just in case.  I almost used one this last round and won't hesitate if it hits me next time. Yeah, the horse story made me stop and think about some nasty people in my life, too (still don't like them though, but at least I thought for a minute ). Jenn51: I've never heard of shadows on MUGAs either. Did the tech say how big it was?  MUGAs really just look at dye flow through the heart for cardiac function.  This shadow sounds like something else that just turned up incidentally (not something they'd be looking for).  Some thoughts: the only things between the pancreas and left ventricle are the stomach, spleen, lung, and diaphragm.  Unless you have a hiatal hernia and the intestine has shoved up there (any GI symptoms?  I know that's hard with chemo... but anything out of the ordinary recently?).  It's also possible that your spleen could be enlarged-this can happen with chemo and/or neulasta.  It would feel kinda tender in that area (but don't push on it! You'd know if it was tender without touching it).  Normally you can't feel a spleen, but when it enlarges (usually in our case with chemo from work overload trying to filter out dead cells) it is palpable.  (It can also enlarge with mono --this is when I've see it mostly).  Any of those organs can look like shadows depending on their status at a given time.  Remember this was just a tech pointing this out.  Keep us posted.  Try not to worry, I'll bet it's not what you're thinking about as no one mentioned it the last time it was there. Also, just curious b/c it's a question I have for my onc-what was the timeframe between your first MUGA and this one?, and was this just a routine re-check or did you have symptoms? Thanks. Got your b-day down.  Don't worry about being the oldest-think of it as \"most life experienced\" or \"wisest\"; sounds better.  I think I may be the youngest so far; I beat Dana by 9 months or so.  Not a title I want to hold as it doesn't necessarily bode well for the future.  I try not to think about it too much.  I know I'll celebrate 40, 50, 60 and beyond like no one else!  Anyway-you're only as old as you act-remember that one, too. Carol:  Great pic.  You look awesome-and so much hair (jealous)!  My pics will be posted later (weekend probably).  Sounds like you had a great day with good tears (OK, minus the butt issues).  Glad you're liking Wendi's book.  She was amazing. My story:  no fam. Hx, never had a mammo (I was only 36 when dx last year).  Weaned ds in June after 20 mos. of BF, and thought, being the good nurse I am, that I should start doing my monthly exams again (I didn't do them while nursing b/c everything was lumpy!).  Felt a thickening in July, thought nothing of it-wasn't even sure I felt it really.  My friend was dx in July with DCIS, so in her honor did a really good exam August 4 and found a lump.  Thought it was a plugged milk duct (I got them a lot during BF both kids... hmmm, I always wonder in hindsight if that was a sign of the ducts' problems).  Had mammo and u/s  Aug. 7 which did not show anything but a teeny area of microcalcifications (did not see the lump, tho' we all could feel it).  Had biopsy Aug. 15= DCIS dx (got these results the day before leaving for our family vacation, was a mess b/c my \"odds\" of it being nothing were like 80-90%; reminds me to never gamble!).  Had lumpectomy Aug. 30 =DCIS + IDC.  Had mastectomy/reconstruction with expander, and augmentation on opposite side Oct. 5 b/c \"dirty\" margins had DCIS still and I was small breasted.  Wasn't going to do chemo b/c of small IDC size (4mm), but had second opinion at UPenn.  They did a new dye study and decided I should do chemo b/c IDC was now found to be multifocal, largest area 4mm, but many 1-2mm IDC spots seen in the DCIS areas.  I'll get yearly digital mammos on the opposite side (none on the reconstructed side), and the UPenn onc rec. MRI yearly for 5 years, so I'll be pushing for that.  I know I'll definitely be getting one at my year anniv. for sure.  Yes, Dana's right: be careful what you wish for!  I always wished for bigger boobs-I got \u2018em now, just not how I would've preferred to get them. Have a good day Jewels!  Thinking of Kim, Kris60, and Dana as they get their chemo-tinins!",

Two things I've gotta say in general...  I really like reading everyone's dx stories.  Not b/c of the dx, but b/c we are all so diverse, and it puts some more history to each of our tales so far.  And two, it's really nice to see that some of you are reading Wendi's book (Carol, Kimberly, Maz).  I hope each of you gets something out of it; she was amazing! Dana:  You are an angel.  Your words are inspirational.  Thanks for the tips and the boost in ego.  Fake tan has always ended up making me look orange, but maybe I'll try a new one.  And I love Oil of Olay's Total Effects moisturizer-now I'm gonna look for those eye sponges! Tucks do work well for butts.  I also use witch hazel pads left over from my deliveries which work awesome, too (they could be the same thing for all I know, never looked at the ingredients to compare).  I use them for a few days after each chemo if I get sore.  I also use a squirt bottle with warm water to clean off if I get really bad (instead of wiping), then dry lightly with TP.  Anusol was given to me in the hospital, too.  It has a numbing medicine in it and that felt great!  Doesn't last real long, but you can use it several times a day. Hee hee-good nursing dx!  Hey, do they still make students write care plans?  I hated those in school.  Never used them in real life either. Egads!  You DID go off on Dex, but I think he deserves it... Kimberly:  Hope the fog doesn't stay long (I'd wish it away, but we all know it's coming regardless).  Wing:  Congrats on finishing AC!  I think you have to celebrate each little step forward.  It's what makes it more bearable and keeps us sane.  It sounds from other posts like T is better.  Here's hoping it is for you, too. Carol:  Your story cracked me up-mainly b/c I completely relate.  I agree-- at least you weren't at Jiffy lube this time!  And you are the total local support person in your area, huh?  I think it's great how you reach out to others.  You are such a good person! D1:  Hope I wasn't too harsh.  I meant it jokingly, of course.  No gold star for him since he didn't call back... good thing he's cute, he can still redeem himself!  Hope he calls today. Loved your latest post.  Had me LOL.  And your family is just beautiful, as are you.  What an awesome, awesome picture!  Just stunning. Paula:  What a great pic!  You and ds look awesome.  Yes, you do-you are a pretty woman!  I like your hat, too. Speaking of Zits (love the carton BTW)-what's up with head acne!  So not liking that!!! Jenn51:  Hey, I have all that makeup from the LGFB class.  Maybe I SHOULD take some extra time to play with it and see what I can do. Sheshe:  Oh girl, it never ends for you.  I hope you start to feel better. Yes, the gas has gotten to some of us (and it is TOXIC on the way out!).  I think Kim has used Gas-X with some relief.  Hope your uncle does well post-transplant.  Prayers for him... Maz:  Don't be so hard on yourself.  What matters is that it was caught and you can still do something about it.  Everything happens for a reason...it just may take you some time to figure it all out. Wow!  It took me forever to get through all the posts and type this up!  I have to go or I'll be late.  About Oprah--- I think she'd love this group and would be a great advocate for BC.  Her website has an area to write our story to submit as a show idea.  2000 characters or less.  Anyone up for the challenge with me?  PM me your ideas!!!  Let do this!  Catch y'all later Jewels. ",

Vettegal:  I have some peachfuzz too.  It appeared right before my third round and has continued to grow.  I think I have about 1/4-1/2 inch now.  Very light and soft.  I skipped my period in February (after a 2 week flow in January!), but now it's back for March and its heavier than usual.  So, I feel your pain, girl!  I hate it on top of everything else.  Hope everyone has a good day off! I have 24 hrs. before I have to slow down again!!",

D1:  I'd call the doc about that nail.  First off, I'd be concerned that the nail is separating from the nailbed and coming off.  Second, you're right- the risk of infection on that le side is higher and I'd want them to tell me how to address it now to prevent infection.  Keep me posted fellow-nail-problem patient! I agree, just b/c chemo's over doesn't mean the \"fun\" is over.  I think this is one of the hardest things for people that aren't going through this to understand.  Nice you are at least done with bloodwork for a while. I wish I could say today's visit went fine, but it didn't go the way I'd like.  Forgive me girls while I b*tch.  You can skip this if you want.  The substitute doc and NP basically heard what I said, but didn't change anything, or really have much to say.  I guess it means my SEs are the usual (they weren't impressed by any of them, so maybe I shouldn't be) and not bad enough to decrease the taxotere dose. They also said decreasing the dose would not cause me to not have a reaction-so I'll get the same tomorrow, just more premeds to hopefully combat a reaction again.  Not much reassurance to me.  They're going to run it extra slow also (how much slower can we go?!?).  I'll be there at least 5 ½ hrs. it looks like, and that's if all goes smoothly.  Sorry girls, I am just SO SICK of this all.  I know I'm preaching to the choir here.  I just want to wake up Thursday and be done and have all the yucky SEs gone!  I think mentally, this last round is the hardest for me.  And I have no patience left whatsoever for SEs, especially ones that will remain past next week, and I know some will unfortunately.  OK, thanks for the rant.  Last round tomorrow-I can do this!  Maybe I'll post from the chair as dh will be there with his laptop!  Good luck also to my bosom buddy for the day tomorrow: Maz .",

Carol:  What a cool idea!  Add my name to the list for secret pals.  I can give you dates for birthdays, too.  It might be nice to have those for the pals to know.  Just one question... how will we be secret if we send stuff in the mail?  I'm just not sneaky enough-especially with chemo brain! dh was surfing the web last night and found some beautiful resorts in AZ that have spas/golf.  Might be a nice for a Jewel reunion (he was thinking of the Jewels getting some pampering.  The golf part was for him. Then I told him you would golf!).  Vettegal:  Sorry to hear your day at the \"bar\" was eventful again.  We must be twins in a previous life...  Well, at least you're finished now.  Yea!!! PALady:  On the subject of \"compression jeans\": I've been having to open the button on my jeans recently--dang it!  Gotta hate when that happens.  I may have to use the rubber band trick that I did when I was pregnant. This is so depressing... Next up-work on the coming week's list.  GTG.",

Paula:  LOL on the \"bananas\"!  I always thought of mine after BF as golf balls in a sock! And yes, the ds loves his bed and slept like a little angel last night. Ahhhh! CarolC;  I am shocked and appalled by your story--how awful a situation you were in!  All I can say is bravo to you for taking that bull by the horns and not backing down, sister!  I was ready to say sue the pants off of them-then I read further about your lawyer, and so I see you've already taken charge there, too.  It is absolutely disgusting that anyone fighting a disease should be put through what you were.  I hope you get justice in the end.  Everything DOES happen for a reason-you should be able to find something better out there where you are appreciated and valued, not treated like a problem.  Your ex-employer should be ashamed! TexRN:  OK, so I'm not too sentimental getting teary looking at his little boy body in his footed-pjs in that big bed?  He looked so tiny in it.  Today when we put his crib away I started getting teary again.  I just keep thinking he was only 20 months when I was dx and couldn't even talk-and look at him now.  I am so thankful to experience every little thing with BOTH my kids now. Jenn51:  Where is spring?  Can we just have more than one sunny day in a row?? Not much going on here Jewels.  Cleaned the house (OK, dh did most of it b/c I get too winded), and did some laundry. Kids are back to school tomorrow.  I have no plans... kinda nice!",

(whine) SIS Kimberly and Carol-what a pair at the bar today!  Good luck girls. I see now there are a lot of posts to read-that's what I get for being a slug yesterday evening and not checking in.  Better refill the ginger ale and get started... Julie:  Well, I guess fatigue is better than puking.  I'd much rather just sleep.  I hope you come out of the fog easily my friend. Paula:  Pain makes me crabby, too!  I hope the Lortabs helped you out and you could sleep.  Bone pain/body aches were the worst thing for me overall I think. Maz:  Rest easy fellow Gem.  As for those counts in the toilet-what goes down, must eventually come up.  Do you get anything to help them out? CarolC:  No lower back pain for me.  If it's lasting a while, I'd run it past your onc just to be safe. Wing:  I thought DE was bad-you REALLY don't get spring in Mass. from what dh tells me. D1:  Ahhh, young love!  Sounds like dd/college girl may have found a nice guy.  Trust me, talking is much better than \"hooking up\" (oh, I do remember-college wasn't that long ago for me). Hope rads went well- was this your first actual treatment, or another sim? Not sure how to keep nails on.  I only know about preventing them from coming off and what to do when then come off (geez, could they have taught me the inbetween?).  I think once they lift, there's not much you can do except keep them short and clean.  I don't think I'd cover them b/c it will lead to a moist environment which could breed fungus and/or bacteria.  Sorry, I'm not much help. Kimberly:  Glad the Tahoe respite has you all relaxed for today.  Sounds like it was just the ticket to help you push onward to the end. Jenn51:  LOL on the idea of a poop pic!  Too funny.  Only a mom (or grandmom) could appreciate that one.  My daughter has a Kodak kids camera that my dad got her last year for Xmas (it really works and takes pictures).  For a while she took pics of anyone in the bathroom (think Candid Camera moments-she'd sneak in on us) -on the toilet, in the shower, whatever.  We had to ban the camera from the bathroom all together. Carol:  Welcome back home.  I read dh the part of your post about driving and he said something about \"OMG, you ladies are crazy\".  Yes, we are, and with chemo-brain to boot!  You had me cracking up.  Hope you did better on the golf course than you did behind the wheel.  And after such a great get-away... who wouldn't have a meltdown, even in 1st class?  You're entitled. dh and I are looking into something in AZ for golf (him)/spa (me).  Either the Jewels can meet there, or we will just go next year-it looks fabulous and relaxing! P.S.  Every time I read about your dogs-I tell dh I want one! Sunshine:  Nice to hear from you again.  Those bills for chemo can induce nausea, huh?  I got one recently, too... $12,000, without the MD visit.  That chemo better be working!  Herceptin in something like $5000 a dose (and I get it about 17 times total).  My neulasta I think is almost $4000 a dose.  I don't know how I'd do it without insurance. Tamoxifen doesn't make hair fall out.  My cousin's been on it for 4 years now-her hair's all back in. Therese:  I feel the same way about this thread-it's \"home\".  Tina:  That's just wrong to have that much snow for April 1.  What a mean April Fool's trick Mother Nature played on MN. I've gotta try those fries.  The closest Trader Joe's is almost an hour away from me.  May have to make a road trip... I'm looking into a trip to AZ for next year-could make it a Jewels reunion spot if enough are interested.  I've never been out West and AZ looks gorgeous-plus lots of spas for some pampering.  My dh golfs-so he'd be happy there, too.  If you know of any good resorts off hand-pass me the names, please.  And lastly-so glad you reached out to you co-worker.  Your story of her response brought tears to my eyes.  Such a great, warm, fuzzy moment-thanks for sharing it! Joan:  Kristi is my fav on DWTS, too.  Tonight I've gotta watch AI!  Such a TV junkie I've become... Whew!  I think I'm all caught up.  Last thing I'd like to pass on to the Jewels:  I'm going to be doing an ACS Relay for Life here in DE in June.  Check out my page at http://www.middletownrelay.org/ , my team is \"Merrie Moppet Marchers\" (Kimberly, hope you don't mind me using the \"Sister in Survival\" on there-I love it and thought it was fitting).  Search under the team name, then pick my name from the members, and it takes you to my page.  The captain is one of my kids' preschool teachers (her mom is a survivor; she named the team).  Anyone who'd like to donate to me and my team can do so on the webpage.  Please don't feel obligated to give, but if you want to I'd appreciate it.  You can give in the name of anyone you'd like also.  They have these really cool luminarias which will be lit in a ceremony-they are only $10 (and all donations are tax-deductible) and I think you can decorate them.  I'll take pictures when I'm there (if any Jewels get luminarias, I'll get a pic of yours specifically if I can find it).  We will also be doing a survivor ceremony where all survivors get to release a white dove and then take a lap on the track together.  Sounds cool to me. Have a great day my Sisters!",

The eye doc said drinking about a half cup of tonic water daily will help with the eye twitching.  Anyone else heard of this?  I guess I'll try it-how bad can tonic water taste? Guess another thing to add to my to-do list will be checking out spa resorts in AZ!  I'll report back later on my finds.  Pulled a \"Carol\" yesty while driving-completely went past an exit and was driving another whole route before I realized it.  A little scary how the brain works-or should I say DOESN'T!  I asked the eye doc not to dilate me today- God knows where I'd end up then. Looks like the chemo bar is full today-GL to Donna, Deb, Tina, and Sunshine!  Special congrats to Sunshine on her last round!! Carol:  Watch that low WBC count lady.  Handwash, handwash, handwash!  Thanks for the report on your retreat.  Glad the sharts stayed away.  What the h#!! is a \"yurt\"?  Guess I could google it like Paula.  I have some of Belleruth Naparstek's relaxation CDs-it always knocks me out listening to her. OMG-Reggie is adorable!!  I HAVE to get a weiner dog someday.  dh is getting tired of me ooh-ing over your dog (our big chocolate dummy is his). And how touching that your friend has honored you in such a way.  Is there a website we can check out? D1:  Glad rads has gone well for you so far.  It sounds like you need a break.  I hope your bil pulls through OK.  Meningitis is such a nasty little bacteria. Glad the brownies were a hit.  I plan on making another batch to take to my old PT group to thank them. Waaaah!  The swelling is still around for you 5 weeks after???  I'm blowing up again this week-eyes, \"cankles\", and I can't get my rings off and on very easily.  Will be bringing it up with the onc next week when I see him.  That and the eye twitching are all I really notice (oh yeah, and being frickin' tired all the time!), so I guess I shouldn't complain.  But I don't like looking like a bald sausage! D*&n that LE!  Hope your legu can get it under control for you with rads.  Like Carol, I was under the impression that rads could exacerbate LE also. I think it's the aluminum in deodorant/anti-perspirant can interfere with rads, so that's why you glad can't wear it during tx. (Carol asked, I believe). SIS Kimberly: Please reiterate what kinds of likes/dislikes we should included on our SP cards--  food, things we like to do?  I'll get them out soon. Hope the fog doesn't roll in for long for you these next few days. Jenn51:  LOL over the chemo-brain story of yours (laughing with you of course, not at you as we've all been there to some degree).  I agree with Kimberly-I'll bet your floor is sparkling! I love reading about how many of us are involved in Relays and Races.  Awesome girls! Did not realize/remember that you were doing herceptin also.  Do you notice anything with it?  I start herceptin alone next week. CT with contrast they make you NPO (no food or drink), just in case there is a problem/reaction to the dye I think.  I can't remember much these days...  Maybe your previous CTs were without contrast. Paula:  Good to hear you're perking up. I must be lucky, too.  My dh watches DWTS-of course, he'd watch the grass grow some days... Wing:  How low did your RBCs go??  I know of people that have had transfusions, but I don't think any of us here have had one yet.  That sucks!  You nurse sounds like she needed a major boot in her butt.  Hope your regular one is back next week for you. I'll try to stay up on things better so my posts aren't so long.",

Carol:  I think coming home from \u2018cation in general makes you tired, let alone coming back to do chemo!  I'd be a little blue... I haven't checked prices yet for resorts, that'll be next.  My agent can get good deals though, and she tells me June is lower priced for AZ. Chemopause lasted only 6 weeks for me.  Guess I should be glad I'm not ER/PR+.  My body's just too regular.  I guess I've got another 10-15 years of periods ahead. Ginny sounds like an amazing person and friend.  If you get raffle tix, let me know.  That quilt is beautiful!  D1:  I think I just got lucky on the eye front.  My contacts are great-designed for dry eyes.  Don't know how I managed to not have a change in my vision.  One lucky break I guess. TexRN:  Hope back to work weekend was not too hard on you.  Good luck on your Komen Walk.  We'll be with you in spirit! Dana:  Good to hear from you.  I hope you can get your CT soon to check on your liver's progress.  Herceptin is supposed to be very helpful in shrinking mets. Vettegal:  So cool you're writing about your experience!  You'll have to let us know how it goes.  Very interesting that you and Vettesis have such different BCs.  I guess it just goes to show how different BC can be in each of us.  I am sure she will draw some strength from you regardless. Jenn51:  Sorry to hear about your fil.  I can't believe how many Jewels have other family member or friends battling health issues.  You have our support, of course regardless/despite of dh and his actions.  I hope for your sake, that he can find an outlet for his added stress constructively. You read right-I'm doing herceptin until January '09, too.  Seems so far away, huh? Paula (and Jenn):  The thought of me and dd having periods together is scary.  I think dh and ds will relocate to another state!  I guess it will happen at some point though-yikes! Next up... the list for the week. Let me post this first.",

Judy:  So sorry to hear your chemo is not working.  I hope Xeloda helps.  Your story brought tears to my eyes as I don't want you to get to the end of your options.  D1:  You go mama!  I can just see you now at that bb game-- bold and bald.  I doubt anyone would challenge you and your decision.  Kudos to dd for stepping it up on the court, too.  Glad bil is turning the corner.

I'm having issues again with my earring holes-they are so sore.  I've been using the Neosporin without much change.  I may have to step it up to another antibiotic cream I have here for the kids (a prescription one--Bacitracin). No goo, just sore, and sometimes itchy-so weird! Julie:  Another one with weekend family/kids' plans.  TKD meet sounds pretty cool.  I tried to get dd to do karate, but she didn't like it.  Maybe when she's older... Tina:  How much snow did you get??  Thinking of you when I heard the news. Just read your latest post... glad it missed you.  And Happy Anniversary! Vettegal:  Hope you had a nice dinner.  Sounds like you need a wedding-sized cake for all the celebrations! Vettesis is in my thoughts as she waits to find out about the nodules.  Please keep us posted.  Your family has had way too much cancer stuff to deal with. For your \"hair notes\":  mine is all different lengths (such a mess), but I guess an average of ¼ inch sounds right.  No curl-yet (I'm hoping for some), and lighter than my natural hair seemed to be when I shaved it off.  It looks like a light blonde color (I used to highlight my hair blonde, so I really didn't realize how dark my \"real\" hair was underneath until I shaved it off-it was definitely a light to medium brown.).  Like D1, I can see my scalp still; the hair's not real thick yet.  Cathy-CA:  I always figure when we don't hear from you that you're off on some cool worldly jaunt.  I'll live vicariously through you... Maz:  Glad you got to talk with Val. How is she doing?  Rest easy this week with your SESs/fog rolling in.  Totally forgot that this week is tax week.  We do ours (or should I say our accountant does them) in February each year.  This year we broke even and got pretty much nothing back.  It sucks, but I guess that's the \"ideal\"-at least that's what the accountant says.  I miss the days when we used to get thousands back. Kimberly:  I SWEAR I'll get my cards out this week.  It's on my list (hope I remember where THAT is!).  Glad you are feeling better.  It really sounds like you had a whopper of an infection.  I am so glad that they were able to catch it before it got even worse-we all know how awful things could be with our compromised immune status.  I have been thinking of you and sending my nurse vibes your way.  Wish I lived closer to help you out more. Sheshe:  Check 2 posts up from your last.  Kimberly has the info about he secret pal cards.  Join in! Finally caught up, unless someone posted while I was reading and typing.  I'll try to stay on top of it all this week. ",

So, I hope all the Jewels are doing well.  D1... thought of you all day and hope the tornadoes did not affect you.  I'll be reading posts now and hope you have written something to let us know. Paula:  Congrats on winning the nursing contest.  What an honor!  Please let us know if there is a link so we can read the story. Carol:  You should be nominated for BC ambassador (LOL-I just read down the post and Kimberly said the same thing!).  I love how you reach out to everyone.  How's training going BTW?  I hope to maybe do a 5K someday, but don't think my little piggies could do 60miles.  I'll be there with you in spirit!   P.S.  I wore my \"boobies\" hat today to my center-they loved it! Sheshe:  I'm slowly working my way up on the TM each week.  I used to only do a half mile on a half hour, now I'm up to 1.5 miles in a half hour.  Guess every little bit counts.  I used to do spinning, and hope this will get me ready again for that in the next month or two. Dana:  I agree with Carol about the \"burning Boob\".  I think I had some of that feeling when I was healing from my mastectomy. Julie:  LOL!  Totally agree that Jason is a hottie (on DWTS).  His dances last night were really good.  He looks nice in those pants-MEOW!!  BTW Christian is easy on the eyes in his pants, too.  I hope he didn't hurt himself too badly. Tina:  Can't believe you got snow AGAIN!  Mother Nature is being quite the \"Mutha\" to your area. Therese:  My onc said pretty much what you posted.  Can't wait to hear about your 5K.  Did you run or walk (just read farther down that you walked)?  I ask b/c I am not much of a runner, but would like to walk one someday.  I'm much better at swimming or biking. Just read you post about your walk-thanks for sharing.  It sounds amazingly cool.  Reading about the guy with the walker made me teary, and I wasn't even there! SIS Kimberly:  Oh, how I hate the computer sometimes!  Please don't take my last response as an affront.  I just meant that I really have to work at thinking of the positive sometimes instead of just blurting out my (sometimes negative) feelings.  You are AMAZING how you seem to do it effortlessly, and I always look forward to your comments and positive spin.  And your words are just beautiful.  Trust me, I own my feelings, and comments-and I highly doubt that my \"mouth\" will ever be quiet (much to my dh's dismay!).  I only hope that I did not offend YOU with my ranting.  I truly strive to be more like you in your positive ways.  Are we OK, sister? Dan:  Hope your doggie's surgery went OK.  I'm sure you'll get lots of kisses on her return. OK, caught up.  Hoping D1 is OK in VA tonight as I didn't see a post from her.  Anyone know what city she lives in?  Gotta get the little ones into bed.  The watch AI and DWTS-I have become such a TV junkie!  It'll be nice when the summer rolls around and there's nothing on (I hope).",

Tina:  Thanks for the details about the port coming out.  I have to wait until January when my herceptin's done, but it's nice to know it's simple.  My ps said she will do it with some sedation.  I am done with surgeries otherwise.  You will be soooo glad to have your exchange done now that fills are finished for you.  How long does your ps make you wait? And I think DE is cursed in the Kentucky Derby!  Last year we had Barbaro and his sad accident, this year it was the filly Eight Belles.  It is just heart wrenching.  I can't stand to hear about them putting a horse down on the track even though I know it takes their misery away. Deb102307:  Glad you escaped the tornadoes.  What is it with all this nasty spring weather??? D1:  So bummed you won't be in Rehoboth with your family!  It's literally less than an hour drive for me.  We'll have to plan it for another time this summer.  I'll be outlet shopping again in August for school clothes for the kids, but I can jet down there anytime really (well, if I have off of work!). Julie:  Yea on the upcoming surgery (it really is a good thing to be moving forward!).  Are you having expanders/implants? SIS Kimberly:  Yum on the food you were talking about!  Sounds delish! Paula:  Congrats on your Komen walk.  Must've been very emotional to do it.  I plan on wearing my boobie hat, too, at my Relay for Life in June.  And I'll bet ds looked dapper for his prom!  It's that time of year... dd has her preschool graduation ceremony coming up at the end of the month... Just watched the Charleston link... brought tears to my eyes.  You go girl!  BTW, you look fabo!! Cathy-CA:  So sorry to hear about your dad and I hope he's doing better.  My dad had a heart attack in Nov. in the midst of my \"mess\" with BC dx and surgeries.  His bypass was the week before I started chemo in January.  He's past his 100 day mark now and doing awesome.  Hope your dad does well, too.  Your trip sounds like so much fun, and way cool you got autographed drumsticks.  Rock on, SIS! January Jewels Schedule for May 5-9 Monday:           Happy Cinco de Mayo!  No txs scheduled.  Let's all celebrate with tacos and Coronas or margaritas! Tuesday:           Last round for Cathy-CA (Yippee!); continues herceptin for a year.                         Kris 60 #3 of 12 for weekly T Wednesday:     Wing (Wendy) #6 of 12 for weekly T Golfer779 (Carol) round #10 IV Last round for CHJ127 (Woohoo!) Thursday:         Last round for LJ13 (Yahoo!); continues herceptin for a year. Friday: WVGirl AC#3 (round #7 of 8)                         Last round for Peg1212 (Yay!)",

D1:  On the home stretch!!!  I'm so excited for you to be done this week. LJ:  My onc said if there was going to be a problem with herceptin and hearts, it usually happens at the beginning (like one of the first few infusions).  So later MUGAs are just \"insurance\" that we're doing OK.  I get my second in June.  I hope he was right.  Let me know how you do. Therese:  Congrats on the new \"girls\"!  Hope you like them as they settle in and that you feel better soon.  I really felt good very quickly afterwards.  It was an easy surgery to recuperate from. PALady:  Congrats on finishing!!  We all understand the tears for sure.  It's truly a big moment. Hope all the other Jewels are doing well.  Back to work tomorrow.  It should be nice as I get to follow my partner for the day and really see what I'll be doing now.",

A downer... photobucket is not working for me.  Every time I try to upload a picture, it says \"upload failed\".  I can't figure out why it won't work.  So I can't post anymore pictures. Paula:  You must be glad the school year is coming to an end.  My mom's a teacher retiring at the end of this school year... she's not done until next week, but I'm sure she's eagerly counting the days left.  Hope you get to your Relay at least for a little bit; it was a really moving event.  Thinking of you and Ed as you prep for his clinical trial. Carol:  Even though I did not post yesty, you were in my thoughts, especially as I was hooked up in the afternoon for my herceptin infusion.  Hooray for you and being finished (well, with the infusions at least)!!!  Just hoping you get through the last round of SEs smoothly (and those remaining pills).  And oh, a few tears are soooo OK-let \u2018em flow! Just saw you post from the \"day of\"... love the picture!  Glad to hear the day was uneventful. Cathy-CA:  Glad to hear rads is going well for you and you aren't too charred.  Hope your training goes well.  I wonder if they plan these walks as a way for all of us to get back in shape after what we've been through?!?  Hahaha... D1:  Glad to hear the good news on your arm and with no docs for 3 months!  I haven't seen my onc since April; it's so weird but nice in a way.  Enjoy the \"free time\". I echo what others said about the Tamox; gag that pill down, and think positively!  Having said that, I do know how you feel about not being \"done\" and trying to explain that to others.  Fighting BC is not just about surgery and chemo.  Hang in there. All the GYN talk reminds me that mine did decide to send me for a DEXA scan.  I have to schedule it today.  Even though I'm far from menopause, I think she wants to get a \"baseline\" and see what, if anything, chemo has done to my bones at this point.  Sounds good to me. Kimberly:  One day closer to no drain... Joan:  Your Survivor Day event sounds nice.  And another walker in our midst! Jenn51:  What a great day-some hair color!  It's amazing how just having enough hair to dye makes us happy, huh?  I can't wait to get back to my blonde, too.  I'm not liking this \"teddy bear brown\" I'm growing. Sheshe:  Remember, one foot in front of the other.  I feel your stress in your post and am hoping you can get some relief from it soon.  Take it easy on yourself and give yourself time to recuperate slowly/at a pace that's right for you.  Everything will fall into place eventually, just have faith.  (((hugs))) Julie:  Hey girl.  Sorry Walmart had you feeling low.  Next time try to imagine everyone looking at you and thinking... \"hey, there's one hot, bald chick!\"  (I hate the looks sometimes, too.) Tina: I agree, the US weather this season has been crazy too soon.   I wonder if all this nasty weather means we'll have a bad hurricane season here in the NE??  I HATE the humidity, but am not too keen on flooding from hurricanes either!

Paula:  Glad you will be able to go to Dallas.  Hope you have a nice time.  Yes, they still make Sun-in.  It used to work beautifully to highlight my blonde hair before (I could skip the salon highlights all summer).  But now I wonder if it will make my new brown hair orange-y like you mentioned.  Hmmmm.... Kimberly:  Glad you are sleeping more comfortably.  I'm sure each night will get better.  I wish I could get rid of my cyborg-port soon, but alas, I'm stuck with it until next year sometime.  I hear removing it is a cinch. Can't wait to hear the details of your weekend.  It sounds like you have another great one planned. PALady:  I have to say I'm not too thrilled with my tattoo now that it is healed.  Maybe I'm just being critical, but I think it could be better. First of all, the color is funny-looking since it's one tone, not a mix of shades.  And she really didn't get the shape right either. I'm going to ask her to touch it up when I see her next month if it still looks strange.  But the rest of the breast (implant and nipple) look fine. I must say I don't know of anyone who's had apocrine carcinoma (but as you said, it's rare, plus I'm not an onco-nurse).  I will help you in anyway I can though if you want to bounce general stuff off me. D1: My chocolate lab had knee surgery about 4 years ago and did great with it.  They kept him in the doggie hospital overnight to monitor him; we couldn't visit him, but they called to give us updates and tell us he did well.  The next day when we brought him home, he was groggy, but did great overall-a lot of sleeping. He kinda lounged around on a bed we had for him on the first floor (near a door to go outside when he had to go). Get a nice soft, clean area for your dog to lie on when she comes home, and ask what type of food to feed her, too.  I can't remember what we fed Sam, but he wasn't really into eating until the next day. For Father's Day...dh got to go to the Red Sox game last month when he was in Boston (he asked for it as an early FD gift).  Tomorrow he's golfing with his dad, and my dad.  My dad and stepmom are visiting for the weekend (tomorrow's dd's dance recital), so maybe we'll all go out for breakfast somewhere, too.  For calcium... I like the Viactiv chews b/c I can pretend it's chocolate (or whatever flavor I've bought for the month).  Plus they are 500mg each, so I can take one or two depending on my other calcium intake for the day.  My multivit is Centrum Women's with calcium; it has 400mg in it.  I don't really like it too much b/c it's huge and I am not a good pill-taker, but it's got a lot of good stuff in it, so I gag it down daily. Hope everyone has a good weekend.  I'll try to check back on Sunday.",

Joan:  Glad to hear you are almost done with all your tx (minus the arimidex, of course).  I'm sure Friday will be a huge party! Dana:  So glad to hear from you and that you sound in good spirits.  Wow!  It sounds like school is almost done for you-good luck on finishing up... graduation will be here before you know it.  What type of nursing do you think you'll end up doing? D1:  Hmmm... I'll be curious to read Kimberly's take on your dreams.  But I'd have to say that your body and mind are working in opposite directions right now from the sounds of it! And count me in on the rum-drinking, optional-book-reading book club with you, Tina, and Julie!  Wish we all lived closer... Julie:  Sorry the last tata fill was so painful.  Good thing it's the last, huh?  Just think how good the girls will look come the end of July (and that you can end the hot summer sans-bra if you want!). Tina:  Happy cleaning!  We are having an open house next Sunday also-so lots of cleaning and prep work this week for me, too.  Maybe I can have my cleaning service picked out in time for a first clean the following week... ds #2 sounds like a man of my own heart-cocktail weenies are my favorite hors d'oevre!  I didn't care about the elaborate stuff they had at my wedding... but I needed my weenies! LJ:  So happy to read that you're doing well and moving forward with stuff.  Isn't it nice that some SEs do fade over time?  Good luck with your upcoming rads. Schedule for the week: Tuesday: Kris 60 #9 of 12 weekly T Wednesday: Last round of weekly T for Wing (Wendy).  Big WOOHOO to her!",

No.  What did yours say about it being OK?  I'd love for my GYN to put me back on a BC pill to help with my whacko periods and ovarian cysts since I'm far from menopause.

BTW, I hear upstate NY is cold and snowy during the winter.  If you want cold and wet/little snow-opt for UD.  Delaware winters suck! Carol:  Glad the first day of rads went well.  I've heard each session is pretty quick.

Gotta go Gals.  Tomorrow I have my next onc appointment (haven't seen him since April), my list of questions is prepared.  I also get my herceptin again.  After that (and a half day in the morning at the \"new job\"), I'm reporting to my \"old job\" for 4 hours of work.  I have Wednesday \"off\", which means no work, but 2 more appointments!",

Please, get that leg checked out!  That swelling doesn't sound normal to me, and I'd want to image the whole leg and knee. Saw the PS today.  For those of you gals doing implants and getting the \"whole boobie\" done... here's a note.  Apparently some recreated breasts cannot or do not take up dye well, especially with some colors of pigment used to tattoo.  My PS isn't sure if the fading of my nipple tattoo is because of this, or just normal fading (which also occurs with tattooing).  So, I have to wait to see how much more it fades in the coming months.  I'll see her again in 1 ½ months and if it's just normal fading, I'll get it retattooed this fall sometime.  Not sure what will be done if it's from the fact that the skin won't take up pigment (I must've missed that explanation somewhere in my brain today); maybe choose another color?  Hmmm...  at this point I just say \"whatever\". Tomorrow's my 8th anniversary.  I guess one test to the \"in sickness and in health\" vow in 8 years ain't so bad!  Dh and I are planning on going out for dinner to my favorite seafood restaurant Saturday (without the kids).  Gotta work late tomorrow, but he already got his presents.  He's golfing next week in a 3 day tournament, and oh yeah...

I'm sure others may chime in here.  I'm not even sure if I understood everything correctly.. so this is just what my brain has processed.",

Yes, dehumidifiers are pretty essential in DE.  We are a very humid area in the summer, which is what makes our summers feel so darned hot (today it's in the low 90s, but feels well over 100).  I affectionately call DE the \"armpit of the nation\"!  Anyway, we run our dehumidifier in the basement to avoid mold growing since it's cool and dark down there (and humid otherwise).  I'll bet the unit we had wasn't broken too long... and there was mold growing already (OK, so the extra wetness from the water didn't help matters any, but you get the drift).  Since we're only focused on the basement and it's one big open room, we can probably replace it for about $200 (a cheaper, basic one).  I figure that's still cheaper than replacing carpet, which is only 3 years old.

So I'm looking forward to a week away from work.  Hope it's relaxing, but remember, the kids are here, and the dog!  But, I may actually be able to check in more often now and write.  I missed you all last week-- I was so busy before we left. Welcome back to D1.  Your vacation sounds incredible.  Congrats on your one year mark, too. Sherry: Ooo-lala on a date!  You are one busy woman right now.  When is the big wedding? Kimberly and Carol: Hope you gals are having fun (I'm sure you are).  Your meals sound yummy.  Julie: Can't believe you're back to school already.  Hope you have a good year.  When do the kids start?  dd is getting so excited for kindergarten... she starts the Monday we return from vacation.  GTG.  The boys are back and ds is into stuff already!",

While my nails aren't falling off (though I wonder about a few...), they look like crap.  Weak, peeling, brittle, and they all break down at the bare minimum or far down on the sides (which hurts).  I can't great them to grow at all despite some great nail strengthener polish.  I used to have fairly nice nails, so this sucks. My hair is still SLOWLY growing.  All this week I've been dousing it with Sun-in.  It's lightening up OK.  I hope my hairdresser can do something better with it soon.

Kimberly:  I hope things improve with your classes.  I can only imagine the stress it is causing you.  Being type A, I DO understand how the constant changes are a PITA. D1:  Hoping you get good news about your BRCA status.  Mine took about 3 weeks for the results to come back.  Also hoping the herbals will get you some more sleep.  I didn't realize how little you slept... I'd be a total bee-otch on that amount!  I could easily do 9 hours a night if I could sleep in all the time. BTW, you look awesome in the pic.  Did not notice any \"roundness\", but I know how you feel.  I still have 5 lbs. I'd love to lose, and really wish I could get rid of 10  (((sigh))).  I am soooo jealous of your blonde hair.  I really miss mine.  I'll have to get around to posting my latest \u2018do.  Will be changing it up in October and hopefully going back to blonde.

Paula:  OK, you need a personal secretary!  I don't know how you do it all. Best of luck to you and dh in all that you have ahead these next few weeks. Tell me more about the tumor markers you are having drawn.  I am also ER-/PR- and I did not think we could have blood tests done for that.  So now I'm curious.  I see my onc in 2 weeks again and can add that to the list of questions I have for him this go-around.

The \"J\" at the end is some weird computer glitch I just figured out.  When you mentioned it, I thought \"what???\" and went back to look.  I'd put a smiley face there when I typed in Word, but somehow in transposing it here, the face is gone and there's a \"J\" instead! Deb102307:  I've always been cold all my life that I can remember, but it's definitely worse with chemo.  Maybe it has to do with the low cells counts?  I seem to be back to my \"usual\" cold self now! Tina:  Loved your post from the \"lounge\"!  And thanks for the comments about my job (and those from many other Jewels)--  I'm starting to come out of my shock and see this as the opportunity it could be. LOL on your later post and the steroid comment!!!  I almost spit my breakfast yogurt on the computer screen! Vettegal:  Girl, you've had a busy week!  No need to EVER apologize for spending time with family-especially with your sister right now!  She needs you, and we're lucky we get any time from you these days with all you have going on. Sista2:  I think I've heard some chatter on here (the site, not necessarily this thread) about the Procrit shot for RBCs.  But honestly, I don't know the details.  Maybe you can google it or do a search on the home page of this site?  Either way, I'd bring it up with your onc next time you see him. Just read the thread farther and saw Kimberly's post-leave it to her to do some detective work for us all!  Thanks Kimberly! D1:  LOL on your post and reality TV!  I must be the \"biggest loser\" b/c I Tivo or watch way too much: DWTS, AI, Survivor, AND Biggest Loser!  I have a couple episodes of Survivor and BL to catch up on still.  Anyhoo... I checked out my nails while reading your post, and some of mine are white with dark lines/rings halfway, too.  I don't think they're lifting, just funky colors.  So sick of lingering chemo effects!  I guess I've been watching Biggest Loser way too much-after all my sweat and good eating this week I expected at least half my 10-lb. gain to be gone-and of course it isn't.  Maybe I've lost 1 pound this week.  Ho Hum! Maz:  Oh my dear, fellow Jewel... a few things to say to you.  First of all, you don't have to be brave right now.  Pray for strength instead and guidance in getting through what seems to be coming for Val.  It's OK to cry and whine and be upset-the thought of losing your friend is so hard and painful.  One of my dear HS friends whom I've kept in touch with over the years e-mailed me this week to tell me her mom who's been fighting ovarian CA for the past few years just got moved to hospice.  I'll tell you what I told her--- hospice is wonderful and will do everything they can to keep that person comfortable and die with dignity.  I know I can't speak for everyone, but I think that's what the dying wish for-peace and comfort.  I know it has to be much harder for those of us left behind.  You have our love and support here to hold you up as best we can.  A quote for you: \"there is no support so strong as the strength that enables one to stand alone\".  Lastly, and on a lighter note-try orabase on the lip sore.  You can get it OTC at any drug store in the mouthcare aisle.  And the eye twitching could be stress, but also chemo.  My eyes are still twitching from chemo!! Take care my friend and keep us posted.  ((((BIG HUGS)))) Carol:  I so can picture your weiner dog laying there at night.  He was probably nice and toasty up against you!  Hee hee. P.S.  Got my mail today-thanks!  I love it!!! Paula:  Glad you got a slower paced week to relax and rejuvenate a little.  Plus the weather HAS been such a bonus this week, huh? Julie:  Your explanation of the \"J\" was so much more savvy and eloquent than mine!  I just want to give you a huge WOOHOO on finishing chemo.  You've had such a tough time with it, I'm happy for you that it's done!  Just focus on getting through the last round of tough SEs by reminding yourself, it's the last time... Love your last post-so fitting!  Hey, maybe that's why my @$$ has gotten so huge??? So 2 weeks and counting before I have to return to the real world Jewels.  Yesty I saw my PS who said I'm ready for the next reconstruction step-a nipple!  Yahoo!  I'm on her schedule for Wednesday already.  Will be glad to have one more thing done before going to work.  She said the tattoo will be done in a month-in office.  The nip part is while I'm totally awake, no IV, no sedation.  Yikes!  I really hope I don't feel it (she gives a local anest.).  It only takes about 10-15 minutes and I can shower the next day.  I have a busy week next week with that added to it, something each day.  But I'm starting to feel less tired after these busy days, so that is a good sign I think.  Off to the grocery store soon, exercise on the TM, and tonight a Relay for Life fundraising Beef N Beer that one of my friends is hosting.  May have to stop and find a new outfit if I have time! ",

I feel like I've missed a lot in the past day.  Today I had the nipple construction \"surgery\".  It was so easy.  Didn't even feel the local anesthestic injections at all (guess there are good points about not feeling anything at the mast. scar site).  I was awake during the whole thing, which only took about 15 minutes (at the most).  No IV or nothin' either.  I am a big chicken (when I'm the patient), so I couldn't look until the end.  But very little bleeding (per the ps).  Anyway... holy cr*p is it (the new nippie) BIG!  Thank God she told me it would look \"oversized\" for now as the skin does shrink overtime.  Looks like my kids could be nursing again it's sticking out so much.  Hahaha!  And it kinda looks like a spider with all the sutures.  So not a pretty sight at all, ladies.  I guess I have to remember (as before), that it's a work in progress.  I'll see her in about a week for suture removal and in a month for the final part-- tattooing.  I hope it looks better over time b/c it looks pretty gross right now and not at all like my previous nipple.  But it was a very easy procedure for any of you that have this ahead.  And I honestly have no pain tonight (that's nice for a change). Otherwise, my life is fairly dull these days.  The ankle swelling seems to be a little better (maybe it's all in my head) with exercising.  So far I have managed to drop 4 lbs.  Still a lot of work ahead. Eyelashes and brows continue to drop.  It's looking pretty homely.  Can't do anything about the lashes, and I've tried to pencil in the brows-- OMG, a make-up artists I am NOT!  I've decided pulling my wig down lower when I go to work might be best! The new job entails working with familes of soon-to-be discharged NICU babies.  I was a NICU nurse for 6 years before I was an NP, so this is right up my alley.  I'll be doing monitor teaching (many of the babies go home on special monitors), and CPR training with the parents.  I'll also be setting up tests on babies with breathing problems (apnea), reading the results, and doing some consults on babies/children admitted to the hospital for \"apparent life threatening events\"-- where they've stopped breathing for an unknown reason.  The new department head (one of my bosses) also hopes to get me and the other NP involved in teaching teen moms with NICU babies,and maybe a few other things now that he knows what we can do as NPs.  I start May 5. I haven't decided what to do about the offer at my old job.  I'm going to meet with the doc there and discuss what his ideas are and see if it's something I want to do.  There are actually many \"pros\" to it (working the \"off\" hours) for me... so we'll see.  Don't want to jump into too much right now. OK, totally knew that was coming on DWTS last night.  I think she did a great job considering though and admire her determination.  And ditto the Jason comments.  PALady:  I totally think Derek and Shannon are gettin' it on! Can't wait to see what happens tonight on AI-- that Jason needs to go.  I'm thinking it's either him or Brooke tonight.  Well, I'm pooped for no apparent reason tonight.  I might not even make it to see AI results.  Hope everyone is feeling well.  Loved the recent posts, but decided to just comment in general tonight.

Will be away this weekend (Saturday is my HS friend's mother's memorial service back in PA where I grew up).  Will check in tomorrow night hopefully, or at least on Sunday. Kimberly:  I was a little surprised with the DWTS results, but I like everyone that's remaining.  I'll just stay tuned for next week.  Dh really thought that MJW should have gone next.  She very uhhh...  bubbly!  I think she's really improved. Cathy-CA:  I've had 2 herceptin-only infusions so far and noticed nothing that day or the next.  They are a breeze!  It's also only 1 ½ hr infusion, which is way faster than my TCH infusions had been.  I get my MUGA again in June.  Hope your H-only infusions go well, too-they should. Oh, and FYI to you and Kimberly... my taste buds came back in 2-3 weeks (after my last infusion), not months. As for hair, I'm 7 weeks out and definitely have a \"5 o'clock shadow\" look going on now.  I can still see my scalp, but it's getting harder to see, and my hair is filling in and (surprise for me, a blonde) is darker than before.  No curls.  I'm hoping in a month or so to have enough to cut or buzz it to all one length so it looks better.  Cathy, the herceptin can supposedly make our hair growth a bit \"stunted\" compared to others not on it. Julie:  Glad you had a nice dinner. D1:  Congrats on tomorrow's big milestone!  And you are making me feel like a SP loser-I've had no time to do anything yet.",

I liked reading about your hair appointment.  I have one June 5th to see what my girl can do for me.  I don't have a lot of hair, but it's definitely growing and probably need some help evening it out.  Plus now that my brows are growing in, they need some help in reshaping, too.  Egads, I'm hairy all over now! Carol:  I so agree with what D1 said about your CMF regimen.  I know from my own experience in working medicine--- take 6 docs/HC providers and you'll get 6 different approaches to a problem, all of which could be correct.  Try not to doubt the validity of your own treatment.  Trust that you and your doc have chosen the right path for YOU. Patty:  Nice to \"see\" you again on here.  You have so much on your plate right now, there's no way you should be feeling bad about not being on here.  You and your sis need each other now.  And it sounds like your dh needs some time with you, too.  It agree, it's hard on them, too.  Kimberly:  As always, I get a chuckle reading your posts.  Always the teacher...  I am glad to hear you are settled in your rads decision.  It's hard enough making all the choices we have to make, but you need to go forward knowing you made the right choice for you.  I have confidence you'd never do anything less. So, I have an even busier week ahead.  The dh left Saturday for 5 days in Boston (business, though he will catch a Red Sox game while there--- his team).  My mom came down and is staying to help me manage through the next few days with the kids and work.  Tuesday I have my next herceptin infusion.  Wednesday I have off and have a full day of things-to-do.  I hope to get my poor SP her first gift then.  I suck, I know... But as someone said, it will be worth it I hope.  Dh comes home late, late Wednesday night.  Thursday the kids have their end-of-year picnic in the AM.  My new job is awesome and is letting me use time I've already worked extra so that I can have the morning off to go.  Next Saturday we're having some of dd's friends over for a pizza party playdate-they each had her over while I was doing chemo, and I wanted to give back to their parents as a thank you.  Disney princess movies, pizza, and some treat (smores or sundaes) are in order as well as 4-5 giggling 5 year old girls.  I am slowly gaining more stamina and momentum.  The weight is not budging-stuck at 4 pounds off.  I guess it will be a slow process until I can exercise more.  I still notice \"sausage ankles\" at the end of each day usually.  The eye twitching is almost gone (more days without it than with it).  The hair's growing...  Just gotta get this ear fixed (that's on next week's agenda). Good News... the week's list is so short now!  All we have this week is the following: Tuesday: Kris60 #5 of 12 weekly T Wednesday: Wing #8 of 12 weekly T I know there are many doing daily rads also (hope every one's holding up and not overfrying). Gotta run.",

So the week's schedule: Monday:         Carol hopefully gets started on her last round after this past week's set back. Tuesday:         Kris60 #7 of 12 weekly T Wednesday:    Wing #10 of 12 weekly T (the home stretch!) Thursday:        open day (though I'm sure some of you are getting your daily \"tans\") Friday: Kimberly has her exchange surgery. Finally, some hellos: Dana: Sorry to hear about your dog (I agree with Paula, he sounds more like yours).  Paula:  Glad you had a good week, and dh is responding to the sz meds. Carol:  Hope the counts are going up so you're set for Monday.  Honestly, if you had to get the neu-nasty shot once-you could do it I'm sure!  But hoping your body will respond on its own. D1:  Good to see you're busy as always.  Hope the b-day for dd was nice.  I still don't have enough hair to ditch the wig yet either.  Waiting for the first report on here that someone's at that point... Tina:  Glad you're recuperating from your exchange well.  When ya going shopping??? Hope to check in again tomorrow as the week will be busy again--  dd has her ballet recital stage rehearsal Monday night, I have tattoing on Tuesday, GYN appt. on Thursday (oh joy), and my Relay is Friday to Saturday.",

      "Content": "Jun 4, 2008 06:36AM KathyL wrote: Good morning Jewels!  I actually have a day off without any appointments or meetings.  It's a good thing, too, because I have some lovely GI illness that started yesterday and is pretty bad today.  Let's just say that I took a Zofran earlier-and it's from the RX I filled for chemo but never had to use then!  And I added an Imodium to it.  Yuk!  Never a dull moment for me. Yesterday I had my tattooing done.  Was very easy.  No pain at all-she numbs the area first with lidocaine injections just in case-but I barely felt that going in.  She draws a circle the same size as the other nip-she measured.  Picks out a close color dye-I don't think a PS is as good as a tattoo artist however she just chose one shade and I hear tattoo artists will mix colors to match better.  And then she tattoos. It all took about 15 minutes. No problem!  It looked pretty good right after she was done-just \"wet\".  I have to keep an abx ointment on it for a week, but I can shower today.  Last night before bed I changed the gauze and it looked kinda gross then-irritated and kinda bloody like it's trying to scab.  Eeeew!  I put some new ointment on and covered it up.  I haven't looked yet today, but I have other issues more pressing at the moment (hoping I can actually sit here and type before running off to the potty again)!  She said it will look really dark at first, and then the pigment fades as the scab is shed off. (like a snake??).  I see her again in a month.  So I had theses great ideas of getting a \"real\" tattoo someday before this adventure-not so sure I want to do that now.  I'm not into looking at wet wounds.  For a nurse, I am a total wuss when it comes to my body. Dd's rehearsals are going well.  Monday was stage rehearsal for ballet-she did great.  Made me real proud.  One of the older girls' (who I've seen dance before and is AWESOME) moms came up to me and commented on dd and said she reminds her of her daughter when she was that age.  I was just glowing for her.  Honestly, it doesn't matter to me what she does-I just want her to have fun right now at this age-but it's nice when your kid is really good at something. Gymnastics was last night.  I think she's much more graceful dancing actually.  She needs to be able to move I think, and gymnastics requires her to slow down and be more precise-not her forte right now.  But she did well and is having fun learning cartwheels and doing her floor and beam routines... that's all that matters.  Next week is both shows. Thinking of you gals again yesty... I met one of my e-mail BC friends in person!  She is a doctor that is doing her fellowship in our NICU (where I primarily work).  I was connected to her from one of the docs in my \"old\" office that she's also friends with.  She had stage 2 I think, and has a young daughter (under age 2).  She had a double mast. with implants (just did her exchange last month). We've been corresponding through e-mail since probably about October last year.  She started working again this week, and we met up in the NICU yesty.  So cool.  I'm a little father along than her-- she still has rads to do.  She looks great; it was so nice to finally meet her face to face.  People probably thought we were weird...  \"Kathy?\"  \"Kirstie?\"-(((big hugs!!))) in the middle of the unit!! So on to the site to see what I've got to catch up on... What a marathon my post is after reading and responding... here goes! D1: Reading your posts about your dd... makes me think of all the years of shuttling kids to and fro from their activities that I have ahead.  And my ds hasn't even started doing anything yet; it's all dd right now!  Yet another reason to keep my dh around (haha, I wouldn't trade him for the world!)-another chauffeur. Also got a laugh out of your post about flow-a-holics!  I think we are for sure.  I got mine planted and am still trying to figure out where I could put more.  Even got two outdoor hangers so I could put some baskets out that I found.  And I just about peed reading your comment to Carol about the dog turds!  You are a riot-I love reading your posts! Also liked reading about your \"bed head\"-I'm eagerly awaiting the day mine does more than stick straight up. I was blonde before (for real), and mine's coming in brown, but no gray at least.  Will def need color once I get some length. I hope your legu can help with your shoulder. Good luck with the painter's.  Another to-do for me.  Our walls are still white, and we've been here for 3 years now. LJ:  You've inspired me to at least ditch my do-rags.  I've been topless at home all the time now (even outside), and when I go out now on the weekends or evenings I just put on a ballcap.  I still am not brave enough to stop wearing the wig at work.  Baby steps for me... Hoping you can get rid of that drain soon-there's true freedom! Yahoo!!!  So excited after reading your post about the path report!  That is just the best news.  It is such a triumph, I think I'd frame that report too! Carol:  You are also my inspiration to get out and make contact with others with BC.  I like being involved but usually shy away from outwardly seeking to do so.  Anyway, I've taken my first step to becoming an official \"peer mentor\" for the DE Breast Cancer Coalition.  Just waiting for the next class (that cracks me up a little, like I need a class to be helpful and friendly-should be interesting to see what it talks about).  And I've entered my name to be considered to model for one of their big functions this fall-they sent me an application since I'm a survivor.  I laughed, was going to toss it, and then thought  \"What the hell? Why not?\".  So I may get to shake the new girls in a show someday!  Hee hee. Happy Belated Anniversary!  Bet that year seemed to go real fast, huh?  I highly doubt your dh would trade you for anything. Just \"knowing\" you here, you're a sweet, caring  person, and I'm sure he's so happy to have you as his wife.  And about the \"celebration\"-there's plenty of time for that later.  I'm sure he'll wait (men will ALWAYS wait eagerly for that). Cracked up reading your description of the evening!  I can just see you typing away while he's scooping doggie poo!  Now that's love! And so glad to read your tx did happen yesty....show off!!... doubling your WBCs!!!  Great news. I really have to schedule a massage some day...  never had one, and they sound relaxing.  Add that on my to-do list for the summer... Maz:  You must have some hearty hair follicles girl!  Mine all seemed to jump ship eventually.  Joan: (my mom's name BTW)  another CA traveler.  I get the feeling I should go too just to see what I'm missing out there. Julie:  Glad to hear about your awesome weekend.  And so nice fills are going well-you deserve it after your chemo course!  One thing to consider... I did small weekly fills (30-50cc every 5-7 days)-very tolerable.  Maybe your PS could do small, frequent fills rather than larger ones spread out more?  It may not hurt as much compared to a big amount going in at one time.  Paula:  Thinking of you and dh in NC.  Duke is a great facility; I'm sure you're getting excellent care. Just read with mixed emotions about your report from Duke.  Sorry you did not get the news you'd hoped for.  I have heard very good things about Gleevac though.  Best of luck to you both in the decisions you have coming up regarding tx. Dana:  Sorry to hear the bad news about Bandit.  You just can't seem to get a break, and I feel for you.  I hope God will give you strength though this ordeal also.  It's just not right to have to watch your pet go through cancer, too. And you are always thinking of others.  I'm sure your doc and nurses will love anything you bring them--- D1's right, cookies are an easy gift, too. Tina:  Read your post with sadness.  So sorry about Cleo.  My oldest kitty is 14.  She's still spunky, but I know her time is limited b/c of her age.  I always worry if I see she hasn't eaten right away.  I hope you can focus on your memories of Cleo when she was younger and feistier.  ((Big Hug)) Had to chuckle after reading your next post with Penny's \"thoughts\".  Dontcha wonder what the other really does think?  That was priceless! Yes, overall, I'd say I am pleased with my recon results.  I can tell it's not like the other, but when I'm dressed (or even in a swim suit), others can't tell it's \"fake\".  It is definitely smaller than the \"real one\", but again, probably only I notice this as most women have a smaller one (funny, this used to be my \"bigger\" boob!).  I DO love the fact that they are bigger and fuller (and perkier) now with the implants-no more \"golf balls in the tube socks\" look for me! Kimberly:  Welcome back!  I'll read on, I'm sure you've posted some details later... Wow!  I just read it.  What an adventure.  Thanks for sharing.  And I do think the wolf is so ironic--- that's true karma, lady. Good luck with the cleaning service.  I'm trying to decide if we have enough moolah to get some help once or twice a month.  I don't want to waste my time on the weekends cleaning anymore, plus I hate it.  I'd rather be doing stuff with my family than chasing dust dinosaurs!  I found an ad here for free services if you're a patient doing BC txs.  Maybe I could get a discount since I'm not that far out from my txs.  (Channeling D1 right now). Ahhh, you did it again...  that story about the dog brought tears to my eyes.  Thanks for sharing it. Jenn51:  I am so glad I could help you a little with just my words.  It's a harsh reality what we've been through, huh?  (((HUG)) to you from me.  Enjoy that pizza!  I got one Monday night-started the week off without cooking-hmmm, nice change!  I'll take care of the extra calories later that accumulated on my hips and butt from it. Cathy-CA:  Are boysenberries like blueberries?  I've actually never had one-must be a West Coast fruit as we don't even carry them here in the stores.  I remember, like Tina, picking raspberries and blackberries.  We used to grow them all the time when I was little.  Plus my mom had a huge veggie garden, and we'd eat snap peas and carrots (after washing them of course) right from it. OK, I made it.  Gotta go see if I can eat something.  The Zofran seems to have calmed my belly down for now.  I'll try to check in later.",

Good luck girls!! Kimberly:  Love the t-shirt idea and the colors.  I wish/hope we could get it made for us all.  Suggestions anyone? AZ Donna:  Hope you doing better today.  Post when you can with an update so we all know how you're doing.  LJ:  Thanks for all the info on exercise.  I used to be really fit.  I'm still not overweight, but I don't really do anything other than work and take care of the house/kids.  I am motivated now to at least get moving.  Maybe it will help ease SEs when I start chemo next week.  I got some vitamins to take (Women's One-a-Day), and started them today.  Major big pills to choke down! Carol: The \"C\" is for cytoxan.  I assume every \"c\" in our cocktails is that as I don't know of other \"c\"s for chemo.  At least that's what my \"c\" is.  Nasty drug... not looking forward to \"meeting\" it. To all the West Coast girls: hope you're doing well.  Read about the storms in our paper today and hoping you are all with power still and not too cold.  It's been chilly here in DE: teens-30s most days.  But it's supposed to warm up to the 40-50s in the next day or so.  I hate to be cold.  We haven't really had much snow (knock on wood) so far... just flurries and snowfall that only lasted a day on the ground.

Welcome Jenn51-- I added you to my list (I'm the unofficial JJ secretary/recorder), D1 will surely add you to the list at the start of the thread.  Sorry you have had to join the BC sisterhood-- but as you will discover we have a great group here.  read on... Jenn51 and CathyCA-- I too am HER2 +, and I think I might have been the only one in our very large group until you 2 appeared.  I have researched ad nauseaum (no pun intended to our sisters who have started chemo already).  I'm doing the herceptin for a year also (that's a given if you are HER2+ and doing chemo).  I'm starting it with 4 rounds of T/C next week, and I get my port Monday.  It truly seems to be the miracle drug for us HER2+ girls.  Make sure to get MUGA scans or some cardiac function test done before starting and rountinely while on Herceptin.  HER2+ BC scared the s*** out of me when I first started reading about it, and I'm still not too happy it took up residence in me... but one thing to cling to is that WHEN we are 5 years out as a survivor, we're considered statistically almost like the rest of the population that never had BC.  Pretty nice stat! Girls, I gotta run to get the kids to bed soon.  I'll check in tomorrow and add more if anyone's interested.",

(BTW, I must be stupid, b/c I can't figure out who you are at all). Carol:  Party on, dude (ette)!  Sounds like you had fun the other eve.  So maybe a little, too much fun, eh?  We'll if BC didn't get us, I doubt some overindulgence here and there will do much worse. Speaking of which, I may be the youngest Jewel, but you are the newly-est wedded (I'll just neglect to remember you've been together for 10 years, so I can pawn this off on you).  No \"drought\" for you!  You should be getting it on like the Energizer Bunny (especially with your energy level these days)!  Hee hee. Carla:  Glad you can take part in the Relays.  They are such a cool, uplifting event.  Hoping the lump is benign.  I agree with LJ's sentiments that AC does do a number on your type of cancer, so try not to fret.  As my dear therapist always says\" do not invite trouble\", and focus on the positive so your body has no choice but to follow suit! Hope the bladder infection is fixed by you abx.  Those are such a pain (literally). Excuse my chemo-brain... but did I miss something?  Did you have chemo first, and then your having a lumpectomy in July?  I guess I'd thought you had surgery first... Kimberly:  Reading your dinner posts sounds like a restaurant menu!  Yum yum! Glad dh came around for you.  I think mine also has his moments where he wonders if this is really over.  Who wouldn't?... I know I still shove that thought to the back of my mind frequently some days.  But like you, I try to focus on the here and now, and that I'm cured. Been thinking of you today as I interviewed my last maid service.  I've narrowed it down to 2 companies and will let them fight it out as to who can give me the better price.  I like them both.  Hope to have them start at the very beginning of July and do every other week.  Yippee! D1:  hee hee.  Sorry to disappoint you on the \"East Coast drought\"... I'll have to tell dh that I need to step it up a little as I'm letting the group down (grin).  He'd be more than happy to keep the quota up for all the Jewels'dhs, I on the other hand am more excited about a good night's sleep these days (hahaha). And damn those blonde nurses (I can say that since I am--- was?-one.  Who knows what the heck color hair I'll have in the next few weeks?)!  LOL on the last paragraph of your post!! Jenn:  You sound like you've been busy.  It is SO hard to not push yourself too much, huh?  I hope things improve for Tyler.  I can't imagine being conscious enough to feel/fight the vent.  The only time I was on one was with my mastectomy, and I don't remember a thing (thank God).

Vaseline also works great (and it's clear, and cheap). I, too am stocking up on things for round one next week:  flavored water, lemons and limes to put in regular water, Biotene rinse and toothpaste, baking soda, Sennakot-S, smooth foods, tea, popsicles, bread to make toast, all my prescribed drugs, Fiber One cereal (thanks Cathy-CA!), ginger ale.  Whew!  It's a regular pharmacy/grocery store here.  And after all that, I'll bet I'll have some side effect that we haven't come across yet-- that's how my crazy body works.  But at least I feel prepared for the common things. Dad is doing well.  Less than 24 hrs. post-op and out of cardiac ICU.  He's extubated and been out of bed 2x today.  I'll get to talk to him on the phone later on (once hte kids are in bed). Today was the last day of work for me.  Tears and bittersweet.  Will miss a lot of those people (since I have no idea when I'll be going back), and also the reality of what I'm leaving for is setting in.  Thank God I still have you all to \"talk\" to!  Goodnight JJs... see ya for more fun tomorrow!  Good luck girls doing chemo-tinis then!",

Julie:  What cute puppies.  We have a choc. lab-- they are a handful! Paula:  Congrats on the last rads!!! Well, it's been a roller coaster week for me.  Today was a downswing I think.  Got the call at 10AM, during an important meeting that ds was sick at school  While trying to figure out what to do, got the call that dd was sick in the next room over!  luckily dh went to the rescue and worked from home the rest of the day, and will be home tomorrow with the dears.  I have no personal time to use until August, so would've had to take it without pay... Then I got my tests results back (OK, I peeked at them-- I know, I know, stupid move!  But I did call both docs to discuss).  My DEXA scan (which looks at bone density), showed osteopenia in my left hip and femur-- not oggd since I'm only 37.  This is one step before osteoporosis.  Really not much I can do except take my calcium (which I do faithfully) and increase weight bearing exercise (which I don't do well).  I guess I have to hope the bone loss slows down or I'll ahve osteoporosis before I'm 40.  I'm waiting to hear of my GYN wants to do more; but I doubt it.  I'll probably get another DEXA next year I'd bet.  Then, my MUGA showed I went from 65% to 53%, which also isn't good.  I haven't heard back from my onc about what he's going to do.  There's only 2 choices that I see--- stop herceptin, or keep going and hope it doesn't do more damage and that this reverses.  I'm not sure which I want.  Herceptin is my safety net, but I really don't want heart damage at my age and especially after my dad had his heart attack.  I was doing OK until I stopped to think about it all.  Stupid move... I started to get upset thinking about not being here for my kids as they grow up--- that BC hadn't got me but all it's long term SEs might!  Worried that if I stop the herceptin the BC will come back.  Oh what a mess!  Sorry girls to be a downer, I just know you'll understand the crazy thoughts better than anyone else.",

Went to work (\"new job\") for 4 hrs., then off to the onc's.  He was 1 ½ hrs. behind schedule which is rare for him-I've never waited that long.  I was getting really perturbed (more so b/c I had to go to my next job and was afraid of being late).  Luckily, they've decided to do the herceptin infusions over an hour now, so I was able to make up some time there.  It's so nice to have a short infusion after the marathons I had for chemo!  Anyway, he did not want to hold off on the herceptin.  He felt my shortness of breath was more due to recuperating from chemo and not being back to \"normal\" yet.  I felt better after his explanations, and know what to look for if things are not as we suspect.  I'll get another MUGA in September just to make sure.  If it's worse, he said we'll stop herceptin early then and be done.  He isn't worried about my rib pain (it's intermittent and has happened twice now); he's seen this happen after reconstruction evidently. After the herceptin infusion, I made it to work (\"old job\"), and had a great evening.  My assistant seems to be good,a nd the eves are quieter than the craziness of the office during the day.  I think I'm gonna like it.  Was out of there early, and home by 8. Today I went to the dentist (uneventful), and saw my breast surgeon.  I really like her and hadn't seen her since January (the day I was hospitalized with the nonexistent WBCs!).  She commented on the \"great looking breasts\" I now have (she makes me laugh in general, but it really cracked me up to hear another woman say that sincerely) and that I was looking good overall.  I'll see her every 6 months now, and she's going to do MRIs of the opposite side every 6 months for a while.  The plan is to do mammo, then 6 months later MRI, then mammo... etc.  for about 2 years.  I get my mammo in August, so I'll get my next MRI in February. Cleaning ladies did make it today!  I like them both, and they did a nice job.  Final verdict will be dh since he's the \"cleaning nazi\" as I call him.  I'm just happy to have help, he's more critical.  Hopefully the kids and pets will not destroy their work before he gets home... Carol:  Sorry I'm responding so late.  I asked my onc about some sx I'd been having (shortness of breath with activity, and some left rib pain), about doing another MUGA (should we, and if so, when), as well as when/if to do a breast MRI (my second opinion onc had recommended it, and so did my surgeon).  Glad to hear you got all your questions answered.  My post will stay in until I'm done with herceptin.  I was told it can come out pretty much as soon as I'm done with that in January.  My breast surgeon and my PS have both said they can do it.  I'm opting for my PS since she's \"neater\". Mailing out the address list sounds great. SuePeet:  My port has been a Godsend!  Unlike others here, I was knocked out for its insertion (\"twilight anesthesia\"; so I was not totally under, but I don't remember a thing), and they'll do the same when they take it out. Julie:  Poo!  Sorry to hear about the HA.  Hope you recovered and could enjoy the dinner. Kimberly:  Loved reading the next installment!  And what an awesome picture of you and your sister-you look fab, girl! Great gifts from your SP.  OK, how do we fold the cranes?! PALady:  Welcome back!  I read Deanna's book, too.  Now I'm reading one about life after treatment... so far, so good. Gotta run.  Dirty kids to bathe.",

Hope all the Jewels are doing well tonight.  I'm sure I'll have more juicy details as the week goes on and chemo starts!  Vettegal: we have them same TC cocktail, some others have done it too (D1, TexRN).  Trudy starts it this week and so does PALady.  Sista2, let us know your new start date.  Sorry your is postponed, but better to get the mix right the first time!  See y'all tomorrow!",

SIS Kimberly:  The poem rocks!!  I don't know how you do it. Totally made me laugh.  I especially like the Dame is Digestive Distress! Jenny (JKiss75): we're doing exactly the same chemo.  My herceptin is every 3 weeks though for a year.  Go for the port girl!  It was sooo easy and you really don't want to be stuck that often; a year is a long time.  It'll be a royal pain in the a**, or should I saw arm.  I also got my port 2 days before chemo, so after I do chemo tomorrow I'll let you know about how sticking the port went.  I'm going to ask for lidocaine spray before they stick me.  I can't do the EMLA cream on a fresh surgical site tomorrow, but my onc told me I can do it in the future if tomorrow doesn't go well with the spray. D1:  Good luck with the shaving tonight. Can't wait to read your next post after that.  You are a riot even in the face of adversity!  And good luck tomorrow with round #2.  I also updated JKiss75 on my list as you did already.  I also gotta plan my outfit for tomorrow-- it's important to at least look good, right?  I've got some comfy windpants, a camisole tank, zip-up sweatshirt, and slip-on Skecher sneaks. Jenn51:  I think the chemo meds. dictate the pre-meds.  Lots of us are doing steroids/decadron before getting a taxane (Taxol or Taxotere) b/c it has a high incidence of allergic reaction.  Since you're getting AC-- they'll tank you up on anti-nauseas as that's AC's biggest MO. Gotta go make dinner.  The dh will be home soon. ",

Woke this morning to a broken, frozen dehumidifier in our basement (dh just happened to be down there and noticed it... thank God).  Dh took a ½ day to clean up the mess: bleach everything as it looks like mold was starting.  He cut out the wet pad and tack edge; will replace later this week when everything dries out and we can survey if more mold grows back.  Crossing our fingers he got to it soon enough and we don't have to replace the carpet; it looked ok.  Looks like the dehumidifier's shot though, so that'll have to be replaced.  And the rust probably stained the carpet.  Things could be worse. But the best part of today was a gift from Carol (don't think she's my PS; this was an extra).  She's the \"seafood goddess of the PNW\"!  It just made my day after the crappy start.  That and the clean house got me smiling again.  Let's see what I've missed over the past 2 days...

CarolC:  woman, you are in my thoughts with the finances.  That was one of my biggest stresses, too.  We ended up getting a home equity loan to help us live and get by while I'm out of work.  But there are TONS of other options. My cancer center gave us a free meeting with a financial advisor who gave us all kinds of info.  I'd suggest you contact your center to see what services they offer and what direction they can steer you in.  Most credit/mortgage companies act stupid unless a go-between person (like a financial advisor) paves the way.  However, I will tell you in today's market, no mortgage co. wants to foreclose a loan.   One option might be paying just interest for a while until you're back on your feet and able to work.  Sometimes you can also refinance your mortgage (I personally didn't like this option as we have a very low rate right now, but it is an option).  Anyway.. call and ask for a social worker at your center and they will do the rest to help get you started.  You DO NOT need more stress and if you've got good credit to start, people should understand and work with you.  Also, I was told to look inot borrowing from 401Ks, life insurance policies, etc.  All very good sources of money in a pinch! JulieK:  Loved the story about the boobs and your dh!  Men !",

Paula:  I added all your info to my list.  Thanks for the dates.  I'm sure D1 will do the same next time she's on.  So sorry to hear about your bad night.  my heart goes out to you.  Sending good vibes and big hugs to you and your DH.  Hope today's a better day for you both.

JulieK: Happy hair shaving tomorrow.  Reading about everyone's hair adventures is kinda liberating.  It takes off some of the stress about it, too-- kinda like when we were all so nervous about tx#1 and then realized it wasn't so bad.  Anyway, I so want to do the mohawk, too-- funny you mentioned it.  Gotta run.  Have a good day and I'll check back later!",

So this weekend marked my one year of finding my lump.  I've decided I'll probably always remember it, but I think I'd rather focus on the end of the month (8/30) when the lump was removed and I was NED from that point on.  Some quick shout outs... D1:  Hope you have a nice 'cation.  It won't be the same without your wit here. Kim:  Loved reading about your latest trip. Julie:  Hope the boobs are healing up and you're feeling better soon.  Carol:  Better you than me in a tent, I'm just not a gal who can handle camping out   even for a good cause. Vettegal:  So sorry to read about your distress with your sis.  I think LJ hit it on the head with her words to you.  I'm sure it must be painful to see your sister making a decision so opposite of yours, but it is her choice.  I think some time/space would benefit you both.  Do you have a counselor you can talk to about it all? To all the other Jewels, thinking of you and hope everyone is enjoying life.  TTFN!",

But both are adjusting well.  I managed to make it through the first day with minimal tears (mine!).  This weekend I got caught up on other business and got all their new school clothes washed and put away.  My basement is filled with Rubbermaid containers of old clothes from birth to the present.  Next on my list this week is calling a consignment store.  I think I have a veritable windfall downstairs!  But I digress... I have missed reading the posts and truly have had the Jewels in my thoughts despite my lack of appearance here.  Top on my agenda for today was to reconnect with you girls. Before I go read the posts... I got my new SP in the mass of mail I finally got through that had been laying on my desk.  I have to say with the craziness of August and the \u2018cation I did not get to send out my last gift to my first SP, so I'll be sending it sometime this month with the first for my new SP.  ((((sigh))) better late than never I guess.  Now I just have to get to the store to buy what is in my mind for each!  Sorry gals!  BC has turned this Type A woman into a much less organized person for sure... or at least one who doesn't freak out if the list sits and waits until tomorrow (or several days later!).  And my postcard from D1 was in the mail pile... so cool.  Can't believe you took the time to send them to us.  I'll keep that with all the cards and notes I've collected since dx. last year.  And finally, I'd like to thank my first SP for the Rita's gift certificate.  What a great treat.  I took the family out Saturday night, and we still have enough left for one more time.  Did we ever decide if we were going to announce who had whom at the end of each quarter? OK, over to the posts.  I'll try to keep it brief or y'all will be reading forever! Kimberly:  Hope your first week of school has gone well.  I know that getting back into work can be both fulfilling and exhausting.  Hope you had some good wine on hand!  BTW, making your own wine sounds like so much fun.  Sherry:  Sounds like the wedding was a success.  The pictures looked beautiful; I LOVED the bridesmaids' dresses.  And you looked fabulous, lady!  The cake looks yum-o! D1:  So your house must be quieter now that college girl is back to school.  I read with envy your post about meeting Joan (BTW-your hair looks awesome, both of you!).  I hope we can meet up someday.  I'm about an hour south of Swarthmore College.  I thought of you while we were on our way to \u2018cation... we went through VA Beach area and then down Rt. 17 to NC.  I think you're more West though? Kowtow to D1 and her mommy skills.  I am in awe of you not only for your organizational skills, but I also hope some of your parenting insight could work its way north to me.  And I mean that seriously. Paula:  Whew!  I think you're busier than I am!  Kudos on the plan with your sub; sounds like it will make your life easier. Carol: OMG!  I know I'm late here, but I just cringed on your posts about ds's tat.  I hope all his tests turn out OK (I know he'll survive his punishments!).  Has he had the Hep B vaccines? I also echo the thoughts of whoever mentioned counseling for ds.  He sounds like he has a lot on his plate, and sometimes kids are relived to have someone to talk to about their parents. And again, jealous of you and Kimberly getting to meet. Sounds like it was fun.  There were some great pics of you two here.  Thanks to you both for sharing. Ouch.. I just read your post on the derm. appointment.  I hope the results are negative. And I just read about your friend's baby.  Shoot me any questions you may have.  I saw TONS of hydrocephalus in our NICU.  The key is a good neurosurgeon. Julie:  Good luck with selling your house.  I know the market here in DE sucks.  I always loved house hunting, but packing/moving is not on my list of favorite things (hate it). Hope your school year goes well.  Reality/real life sucks, huh?  I kinda miss the freedom I had when I wasn't working, but BC was totally not the reason I was aiming for when I said I wish I didn't have to work!  Next time, God, I mean I want to win the lottery! Kris60:  I say go for the reconstruction if you can have insurance pay for it!  At least explore your options.  How sore were you after the port came out?  I have mine until January when herceptin's done. Cathy-CA: Another kid off to college!  I feel so strange to be at the other end of the spectrum with my 2 kids just starting the school process. Maz:  Looks like you'll be getting ready for your \u2018cation soon.  Watch out for the hurricanes down that way! LJ:  I'm thinking you should be done rads by now (I'm a little behind, huh?).  Hope you're healing well.  Yup... I just read your post on th subject... congrats!  LOL on your story about the guy at the light.  I also loved your insight on people like him.  You have a great way with words. Joan:  How cool that Lucy could be a therapy dog.  I loved the one that came through our chemo center (a golden retriever).  Saw your pics with D1... your hair does look great!  I have about the same amount, but mine's much darker (WTF?  I was blonde before chemo!).  I have waves/curls which I am so not used to (I had poker straight hair prior to chemo)... I'm thinking I could use some styling tips and gel, too. People who did not know me before BC love my hair... I'm still not so sure about it because it's so different than what I'm used to. Have a good school year! Jenn:  Sorry to hear about your illness and knee.  Glad you are back here to post and hope you're out of the darkness.  Being a patient sucks! OK, that's it for me.  So much more I'd like to write, but this is long enough for now.  Missed you gals a bunch.",

Majorly frustrating for me.  And the hospital's wifi boots me off often. Grrr!  Anyway, I am SOOO glad to hear everyone did well this week with their chemo rounds.  I think we've all done at least one round now, except Dana who should start soon.  D1: can you check you list and post this coming week's data for me if you have it?  I won't be home in time to do it and have no paper to jot notes.  The brain can only remember so much from one thread page to the next.  SIS Kimberly, JulieK, and vettegal stick out in my little fuzzy chemo-pea-brain as having good posts.  Sorry I can't recall the specifics right now.  But smiles to you 3.  D1: I also liked your idea for my kids, thanks!  The little monsters were too busy fighting last night for me to relay it to the dh.  I may tell my daughter a version of it today when I see her.  The dh says she's doing better today after he talked with her.  All the teachers in the group: didn't realize there were so many of you!  Such a great profession (my whole family except me is/was educators.  My bro was a teacher for many years and is going to PA school now).  You guys really play such an important part in all of our futures.  Hugs to you all.  Love all the poems and inspirational stuff people are posting, too.  It's been uplifting.  Deb102307: about the ANC... mine was 0 on admission (with a manual count around 100; the lab techs will check themselves if the machines give a low number).  I was told they like ANCs to be >500.  The ANC is the \"absolute neutrophil count\", a direct reflection of how many \"baby\" white cells you have.  Neutrophils are new WBCs.  WBC normal is 3.5-11 (there are several types of white blood cells in the WBC overall count).  If both ANC and WBC are low, you're at high risk for infection and they'll watch you closely for signs of infection.  The reason I was admitted was mine were low AND I was symptomatic (had a fever and was lethargic).  SO... stay away from sickies!!  Watch your temp, handwash like crazy.  I'd even suggest you get a facemask from a drugstore and wear it if you have to be around anyone other than immediate family, or if your family is sick at all (even mild cold symptoms).  You DO NOT want to end up where I did.  And no one I've been around is sick that I know of. So Jewels, thank you all for your good vibes, the cell counts are going up!  What a pwerful group we are!  I am praying to be out of here tomorrow or Monday.  I am feeling much better, though the antibiotics are still working their wonders on my GI tract (hey, wasn't I the other extreme earlier this week???  Not fair!).  My goal for today is to hit the shower :)  Thanks for all the love and support.  It'll come back at you when you guys need it, too, I promise.",

Joan:  How nice that Lucy can have a doggie walker during the day.  I'll bet she loves it, and it probably helps her not get lonely while you work. Carol:  Oh, I agree with D1.... I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall while you shopped at that store!!  What a \"hoot\" (pun intended)!  I can't believe your walk is just around the corner already. And great news that your skin was benign.  And that your friend's baby did well with surgery. As for the mammo with port.... my center did it.  It took some repositioning so the port did not get hit or squeezed, but the pics turned out fine and they were able to see what needed to be seen.  I think the key is a center that's used to dealing with implants, ports, etc.  Mine didn't even blink an eye at either.  I'm sure yours would do fine, too.  D1 mentioned an MRI to you... I'll get one in February (alternating them every 6 months with mammos, so I get both each year).  This may sound dumb, but can they do an MRI with a port?  I know they always ask about metal parts, fillings, etc. because of the magnetic fields... And I can't remember if I answered you about who's taking my port out... I decided to have my ps do it (my breast surgeon put it in), mainly b/c she does a great job with fixing up scars.  My port has a yucky looking scar in 2 places; I'm eager for the ps to make it look pretty in January. D1:  I, too, still have a stubborn 5 pounds to lose.  It doesn't seem to want to budge.  Maybe it's my new boobs???  Hahaha.  I have my first real hair appointment scheduled for October.  I will definitely be able to do color then.  I haven't decided if I want to cut it or let it continue to grow.  Right now it's growing \"out\", not down/longer.  It's getting bushy.  I hope the weight of it will pull it down soon. Thinking of you today as Hanna went through our area.  So far we are fairing OK, with just wind and rain in spurts. Julie:  Hope you can rest so that muscle settles down.  Wendy:  I'm amazed that you caught up on all the posts.  It can be real intimidating with this chatty bunch.  It was nice to hear from you regardless. That's it for now.  Catch ya later, girls.",

Carol: We don't have a generator at our house.  We just haven't had enough power outages to make it worth while yet.  Our power lines are mostly underground in our neighborhood, and cable/phone/internet are too with a fiber optic system from Verizon (FiOS for those that know what that is).  The few outages we've had though, it takes hours to be fixed, so it makes me weigh the pros and cons a lot. Got the appointment today for Nip Surgery #2--- October 1.  Hope this time works. Gonna go chillax before my long day tomorrow. ",

I had my MUGA again yesterday and my EF is back up to where it had been pre-chemo.  I'm really happy about that.  So, I'm gonna try to catch up on posts since it's really slow here at work today... PALady:  Didn't realize it had been that long since you'd been on here!  The picture looks great.  Isn't it weird having curly hair?  Mine is the same as yours, just gets more wild the longer it grows. Julie:  I can totally feel your frustration in your latest post. It sounds like a real sucky situation for you with the house.  Grrrr!  We built our house 3 years ago b/c we couldn't find what we wanted on the market.  All I have to say is that you need to research your builder.  Ours was great with a great reputation, but we still had issues, and everything seemed to be an option.  In hindsight I really didn't know what I know now (this is only my second house) and there are a few things I wish I'd gotten despite the cost.  Live and learn for me... Paula:  I don't know much about tumor markers (guess I'll have to ask about that next week), but I don't think my onc does them as I already asked what he'd do for me and that wasn't mentioned.  He doesn't like to do a lot in general b/c of the stress and procedures associated with false positives.  I get a mammo yearly and an MRI yearly for a while; I have them planned so they aren't at the same time. Therese:  Glad you are OK.  It looks like parts of your state are really hurting. D1:  Thanks for the nuts!  Hope there was no pun intended....Heeheehee!  I was pretty sure you were my first SP, but glad you clarified it for my chemo-brain!  BTW, they are delish. Oh yeah, LE bites!  It really sucks that you have to deal with it. Sorry to hear about your sister.  Is she talking with anyone (counselor)?  Her stress level must be sky-high.  I think you both should erase 8/17 off your calendars for next year. Carol:  You look like you had a great time, gal!  Enjoy that feeling, you deserve it. Sheshe:  My cousin, who incidentally had BC 5 years ago, just had her ball bladder removed this week.  Hope you feel better soon... and get that checked out ASAP! Jenn: Don't feel like you'll bring us down by chatting about your troubles/worries.  You don't have to only talk about happy things here... that's what this is all about.  I agree with D1... have you talked to anyone professional yet?  It is sooo helpful. Sending \"warm fuzzies\" your way... Kim:  I know it's our civic duty, but I detest jury duty!  I know I'll be called upon again soon, b/c I was supposed to go but it was during chemo, so they postponed it for a few months.  I may try D1's suggestion, or just plead that my chemo-addled brain is useless!  Hope your trial is done soon, you have enough to do from the sounds of it. Whew!  All caught up. See you this weekend.",

Last night was dd's open house for kindergarten.  May I just gush for a moment?  I am so proud of her and all she's accomplished so far in one month of school.  Her teacher is awesome and had nice things to say about my girl.  I hope dd continues to love school this much over the next 12+ years.  She's obviously loving it right now and doing great. Also had my onc appt and herceptin yesterday.  My last MUGA was great (can't remember if I reported that or not... damn chemo brain!)-back up in the 60 percentiles.  It looks like I have 4 more herceptin infusions to go, and then I'm done.  He said I can get the port out then.  So my last infusion is slated for Dec. 17!  Maybe I'll get my port out before Christmas...  Also reviewed the next few years' plan...basically MRI/mammo yearly, and see the breast surgeon and onc alternating every 3 months for 2-3 years.  I asked about Vitamin D levels... he said mine should be fine as I faithfully take it with my calcium.  Also asked about other scans or tests... none for me as of now.  Guess that's all good news.  Now I just gotta start doing some \"weight bearing\" exercises.  Any suggestions from you who are so much more active than me?  I know it sounds bad... but I just don't have enough time in the day to do all this stuff!  I get up at 5 and often don't get to relax and have any \"me time\" until the kids are in bed by 7:30-8.  I go to bed at 9.  Yikes! Anyway... so on to the posts... Carol:  Thanks for sharing the pics of your walk.  You are amazing!  Sorry to hear about your dog.  Vet bills can be outrageous, huh?  I swear I'll get pet insurance with my next animal.  Our dog had surgery at age 5 on his knee--- cost over $2500.  I feel your pain... D1:  So awesome that you got to meet another Jewel!  Loved the pics of you and Paula.  LOL at the \"thug pic\"!  Hope your sis gets good news. Cathy-CA:  Welcome back world traveler.  I wish I could just ride along in your luggage to see the places you've been.  It sounds amazing.  Hope your echo looks good.  How many more herceptins do you have left? That's it for me.  Later, alligator!",

Some fun things I've been up to:  Sunday I hosted a Lissa Cole purse party. You design your own purse and then the company makes it.  So much fun, and really nice purses.  I have 3 already.  Can't wait to see my new ones in a few weeks.  Also, this coming Friday I have a date (when was the last time I did that?!?)!  dh and I are going to Wilmington to hear Robin Roberts from GMA speak.  We paid extra for \"the good seats\" which also include an hors d'oeuvre hour afterwards where we'll get to meet Robin.  I am so excited!  Also this month: Oct. 5 was my one year mark from my mastectomy.  Happy to report my second nip surgery went well so far.  It takes some time to see if it \"stays\" after healing.  Can't believe I've been without that boob for a whole year.  And my beloved ds will be 3 one the 26th.  For some reason, looking at him reminds me of how long this has all been going on for me.  I had just stopped nursing him when I found my lump last August, and he was barely talking then.  Now he looks like such a big boy and he chatters away all the time!  Oh, how I love my 2 kids.  I also get to be a classroom helper later this month in dd's class.  She is thrilled I'll be there, and so am I. GTG, busy and long day tomorrow.  Working both jobs.  Sorry it's been so long, Jewels!",

Can't end on a bad note... we secured a new beach house for next summer in NC.  Had to go a bit cheaper since we had to change the week we'll be there and it's now considered \"peak season\" (so more expensive).  Just glad we found a house and can look ahead to that vacation.  Gotta run.  Thinking of you all.",

Tina:  I feel your pain... chocolate tastes really bad to me, too, for about 10-14 days each tx.  And it's like my 5th food group normally.  So sad!  My dh got me an ice cream cake for V-Day (my favorite.. I told him no flowers, just cake)-- I'll be saving it until the tastebuds return.  Glad to hear the SEs are sparing you somewhat this round.  Yay!  SIS KImberly: Sucks about the appliance reschedule.  I think you should be allowed to give THEM a timeframe for coming back (\"between 1-2PM on THIS day only).  hahaha!  And I know you love wine, so double bummer that it wasn't good.  Your place with the horses sounds beautiful.  Our neighborhood was built on land that used to be a horse farm in the \"countryside\" of DE-- the owner still has some land here and lets the horses out each day-- we can see them from our house.  But it's nothing like what you have.  Beautiful animals...  Oh, and about the zits!  I noticed it, too-- my face has never been this bad, not even as a teen.  And they are HUGE buggers!  Someone on another thread said to put tea tree oil (the stuff we use on our nails) on the zits-- it works like magic!  I tried it last night, and my little buddy's almost gone this AM. JulieK:  Hope the change in meds is better for you.  Just curious, what are they doing differently this next time since you seemed to be on everything already?  Your IL snow is heading my way today, by the way.  My step-bro lives in Chicago and he's expecting his first baby any day now.  I teased him when he found out originally a Feb. due date that he'd better be prepared to deliver the baby himself, knowing how Chicago winters can be!  Hope I didn't jinx him... CHJ:  So glad to see you made it to tx yesterday-- great pic!  It's cold here, too.  I might have to put 2 hats on the dome today :) Wing (Wendy):  welcome to the group.  Ditto on what everyone said.  We're an amazing group.  I look forward to hearing more about you along our journey.  Let me and D1 know your other tx dates, too so we can post them and shout out when they come up. Kris60: Rest this round!  It seems to be the one lesson we're all learning to head off bad SEs.  And yes, many of us have noticed the weight gain (sadly).  Cause can be many things, I think: the drugs for SEs, the chemo itself (taxanes can cause fluid retention, hence wt. gain), the fact that we eat to not get nauseous, the fact that we are not as active or exercising as much b/c we CAN'T-- we're tired!  I think it's the paradox of BC... we're not supposed to gain wt., but everything does it to us anyway.  I just keep telling myself to do the best I can and I'll get it all off later when chemo's done.  Sorry to hear about Aunt Flo, too.  I'm hoping mine will stay away this month-- can't we get one benefit from chemo, please?  My damn body's so regular though it's amazing I don't have 50 kids the way I ovulate! Paula:  Hope you get well soon.  Don't let it get you down for V-Day celebrating... just make it a low-key thing this year.  And celebrate big later on.  Carol: Man, you drink like a camel, woman!  I thought I was doing good getting 70-80oz/day.  LOL!  So cool about your friend's \"surprise\".  I say, everything happens for a reason.  Best of luck to her! CarolC: I had some tingling of my pinky fingers and toes with round one.  So far this round I have not noticed it (yet?).  Are you doing Taxol or Taxotere?  Taxol, I think, tends to be the bigger offender.  And your boss seems to be a bit of a B!  Why do people think they are \"helping\" by \"supporting\" like that and pushing you?  My OM at work is the same way. Like unless you drop over dead, \"it's better to just move forward\" and work to the bone.  Let them experience chemo just once... Ok, and my question for the day... anyone noticing their heart pounding?  Yesterday I noticed it 2-3 times while I was just sitting around doing nothing.  It wasn't painful, just weird.  Like when you can feel your pulse throbbing in your head, and then it just goes away.  The freak nurse that I am, I took my pulse and it wasn't that much higher than it usually is.  If I could've, I would've checked my BP.. but I can't at home.  If it keeps happening, of course I'll call my onc, but just wondering if it's a chemo-thing or if my heart's gonna explode!  My MUGA before chemo was great and I have no hx of heart problems. Catch the Gems later. Now that I've gotta caught up on posts, I gotta go get some stuff done!",

Number one, I HATE the MRI, there's just not enough Xanax in the world to get me back in that machine.  I swear I should be knocked out.  And number two I'm really worried about the possibility of a brain met.  I know I'm being ridiculous, but I'm frickin' scared of even the remote possibility.  He spouted off some stats that I'm sure were supposed to reassure me this is just a precaution, but it didn't work.  Remember, I was told when I found my original lump there was \"a less than 5% chance\" it was anything.  So numbers don't reassure me at all.  I'm trying to remain calm but it isn't working too well.  Sorry to be a downer and ramble, but I know I can do it here safely, so thanks for reading this mess!  I'll try and write more later.",

Julie: I am so hoping your weekend went better this time.  Please let us know when you can if your new regimen working better.  Sending good vibes your way. Deb:  Egad!  Your docs shouldn't use scare tactics like that! Having been through neutropenic fever myself already, I can tell you it's no picnic though.  Your Neupogen and Procrit should help ward off the evil spirits for you.  I had no trouble with it this round after I got Neulasta.  Glad to hear your partner is better and you did not catch it.  So, should partners be \"dp\"s on here?  All of you creative people... I am so jealous.  The scrapbooks and poems, etc are so cool to read and hear about.  Somebody should write a book about the Jewels... SIS KImberly:  Glad your eyes are better with the drops.  I have some too here in my \"home pharmacy\" that I use time to time.  I agree with others about the timing (being a herceptin gal myself).  I considered myself a survivor after my cancer was removed with surgery (August).  But I count my anniversary as when I found my lump and the whole journey started (which was the beginning of August).  I think in some ways, I'll count each part as a yearly milestone at the beginning (finding lump and getting dx, surgeries, chemo start and finish, finishing herceptin). WVgirl:  Good ot hear your dh is coming around.  I totally agree with LJ's great analysis.  Nice that you have a support group, too.  Yay! Dana: Chase those dreams girl... you'll catch them someday!  What a nice plan for your future.  I believe that people can acheive anything they set their minds to if they want it bad enough.  And good luck Tuesday-- I'll be thinking about you as you get your liver results... we want all NEGATIVE (meaning no cancer, not bad news ). Vettegal:  Welcome to our mini-club of Taxotere reactors:  you, me and D1!  Sucks, huh?  I laugh about it now, but it was very scary at the time and I hope it doesn't hapen again when I do #3 next week.  And about the rib pain... I had it to.  The back of my head, neck, shoulders, and ribs all felt like I'd been beat up and was bruised for about 2 days each round.  I hope that pain isn't cumulative. PALady: I think my body is gearing up for TOM again, too!  I have all my usual s/s for the week before.  I will be so pissed if I get it again next week.  So not fair!  I have heard about nioxin shampoo also.  My mom's hairdresser had ordered me a bottle from PA and it's on its way.  I can't wait to try it on my fuzz. Carol:  Hope you had a nice round of golf.  My dh lives for it.  TexRN:  good to hear from you again.  I can sympathize with you about the colds.  I've had two also (and am currently still \"enjoying\" the second for over a week now).  I've tried avoiding people too, but it must be my lovely kids sharing with me.  I've gone through so many tissue boxes already it's insane. D1:  Good luck Tues. with your specialist.  I hope they can bring you some relief and good info.  And what's up with your nails?? I hope you don't lose them either... (it's one of my biggest fears, too). What kind of nail care regimen have you been doing so far? Wing: LOL about your reaction to the old bats' comments!  You probably look better bald than any of them do with hair . Gotta go feed everyone.  I'll try to keep up better today and tomorrow!",

I'd love to get a new dining room set this year.  We'll have to see how far out of the hole we get for the first half of 2009.  Patty:  LOL on your Walmart hot flash!  I can only imagine what that was like.

And he said the pain from neu-nasty should be about the same, but gave me the go-ahead to try Claritin (he'd not heard about that, but said he saw no reason not to try it.  I'll report back on how it helped or not for me).  He also said the fatigue is \"somewhat cumulative\" with each round, but not a major jump each time.  So, I'm reassured by all of you, and by him-- got MY gameface on now! Judy: sorry you're \"blue Jewel\" and hope you turn around like you did last time.  I do think now that you said it, I remember you saying you had mets.  I think someone else here has them too, but that I can't remember.  I do not know your er/pr, her2 status-- what is your onc's plan after your AC is done?  There's so much positive stuff out there for stage 4 girls these days.  Stay strong! Vettgeal: Exactly!  You could've been gone the whole time (like me!), but you are trying to work.  Your boss should suck it up, quit b*itching, and apologize to you!  I like Paula's diarrhea curse...

TexRN:  Thanks for another good perspective on the \"blues\".  What type of ICU nurse are you?  I was NICU (neonatal, surgical; so all the \"train wreck\" cases) for 6 years before I was an NP.  Talk about sad stuff and resilience!  It taught me a lot about life and death, too.  And how wrong it is to see a baby die.  But it was my favorite job so far and I do miss it.  D1:  Sooo happy for you that tomorrow's the end of chemo!  Do a little dance on the way out afterwards.  And I'm glad to hear my little chemo-brain did remember some facts accurately for you.  I know you are \"determined\" to get that LE and cording under control (hee hee), and I know you'll do your best.",

From a distance, each horse looks like any other horse.  But if you stop your car, or are walking by, you will notice something quite amazing. Looking into the eyes of one horse will disclose that he is blind. His owner has chosen not to have him put down, but has made a good home for him. This alone is amazing. If you stand nearby and listen, you will hear the sound of a bell. Looking around for the source of the sound, you will see that it comes from the smaller horse in the field. Attached to the horse's halter is a small bell. It lets the blind friend know where the other horse is, so he can follow. As you stand and watch these two horses, you'll see that the horse with the bell is always checking on the blind horse, and that the blind horse will listen for the bell and then slowly walk to where the other horse is, trusting that he will not be led astray. When the horse with the bell returns to the shelter of the barn each evening, it stops occasionally and looks back, making sure that the blind friend isn't too far behind to hear the bell. Like the owners of these two horses, God does not throw us away just because we are not perfect or because we have problems or challenges. He watches over us and even brings others into our lives to help us when we are in need. Sometimes we are the blind horse being guided by the little ringing bell of those who God places in our lives. Other times we are the guide horse, helping others to find their way....Good friends are like that... you may not always see them, but you know they are always there. Please listen for my bell, and I'll listen for yours. And remember... everyone you meet is fighting some kind of battle. Love generously, Care deeply, Speak kindly....Leave the rest to God.",

On the ugly LE sleeve-there's a new job opportunity for someone: designing prettier compression garments. Paula:  Glad you got Taxol #1 under your belt without problem.  LJ gave you some good advice on iron (she gets the dietary crown!).  Good to be proactive so your plan can hopefully go as you want it to. TexRN:  OK, classic chemo brain story there!  At least you didn't get home without the kids-that's one of my fears.  I always joke with my kids' teachers to please make sure I leave with all their stuff, and also THEM! I think we've all had our share of \"mom moments\" with sick kids.  I know I blew off my dd's complaints one AM and she was sent home from school within 2 hours with a whopping fever.  Man, did I feel bad.  And, uh... most adults are NOT immune to strep (not sure what that doc is thinking).  It's a bacteria, and anyone-including adults can get it.  I caught it from one of my patients about 2 years ago, and it sucked!  No kissing or sharing utensils with dd for 24 hrs. (OK, my post may be too late).  Once she's had abx in her for 24 hrs., she's not contagious.  Good news: strep responds pretty well to abx and the kids really feel good within 2-3 days. I have the ankle swelling this time, too (had the eyelids before, and that continues)-and it's just before my last tx (so about 2 weeks after the last tx).  I also noticed today that my rings were tight-took \u2018em off before it gets worse there. I've gained about 5 lbs. since I started chemo-I'm totally blaming it mostly on swelling.  Like LJ, I don't eat salt-so no help there.  I prop my feet up, too, at night.  And I definitely notice the \"sausage\" look when I take off my socks at the end of the day.  Yuk! WVGirl:  What great co-workers you have... flowers and a lovely poem.  Thanks for sharing it with us. Julie:  So glad the vomiting did not hit you this time, but it sounds like some other things are hitting you instead.  Migraines sound so miserable.  And-- scary thing blacking out!  I hope you feel better soon. Carol:  You have surpassed me on the GI front; I pass the crown onto you.  Sorry to hear you are still having issues there. Thanks for the update on Kalen, pass on our wishes to her to feel better soon. I liked your wine and cookies story-got a chuckle out of the visual. Well, it's getting dark so dh and the kids will be coming inside soon.  I'll be back tomorrow.  Gotta post the weekly events!",

I've read the many, many posts so know I'm thinking of all of you even if I don't write to you below... D1:  Glad that nail is hanging on.  Sounds like you've been busy! Vettegal:  My heart goes out to you and your sister.  I'm sure you will be a huge support/strength to her.  Cathy-CA (and others doing BRCA testing):  Remember that BRCA is not just for breast cancer.  So those of us that have sons, BCRA2 mutations in men can indicate an increased risk for male BC and prostate cancer.  Some pancreatic and colon cancers have also been linked to BRCA mutations.  Good news on the hairfront, too.  Thanks for posting about the woman you met.  I miss my hair and want it back! Paula:  You and I BOTH need to win Powerball. LJ:  Glad you're father along than I thought! Dana:  LOL about the \"hair down there\".  I have a few that have managed to hang on-it looks like a bad brazilian waxing! Wendy:  Glad to see you again.  I took a long break from reading anything BC related, too (except this thread of course).  I rarely surf for info anymore either (I just read updates that I subscribe to, and only if I see something interesting).  I just started reading Deanna Favre's book; the first BC related read in months.  SIS Kimberly:  I had the best steak last night.  It was sooo good, I'm practically mooing today.  Hopefully it'll help my sad RBCs. All caught up!  Catch you Gems later.",

Dana:  From one nurse to another-- I used to say and now firmly believe the best nursing experience is being a patient.  It teaches you more than any book will (motherhood also did the same for me and my kids are only 2 and 5).  I'm not sure about work--- it depends on the germ factor where you'll be.  I do peds.-- so I've opted to not work.  Flu, rotavirus, MRSA infections are not a good thing while on chemo and I see all that plus more on a daily basis.  I'm just hoping my little rugrats at home don't bring me something!  I agree with all the lymphedema comments.  Find a PT/OT that specializes in it if you can to get connected on what to do to avoid it.  As for being positive-- it takes time and practice.  I remember how hopeless and sad I felt when I was dx in August.  4 months and 3 surgeries later I am doing better, but it takes practice and lots of talking (like here!).  But don't get me wrong-- it's a roller coaster ride and some days are better than others.  One suggestion-- find a good psychotherapist.  Another nursing rule-- practice what you preach and take care of yourself first (I see a GREAT therapist who has helped me immensely and recommend to all going through any chronic illness or acute situation-- hey we have both!).  Hang in there.  We'll all get through this.  And think of what a great nurse you'll be in the end.  P.S.  You can send me a message anytime if you want to talk more about nursing.  I was also a college nursing instructor and staff nurse for a while before I was an NP. D1:  Cytoxan causes mouth sores.  I'm going to be doing the same TC as you and that's the offender! Sheery:  I've never heard of the \"neu-nasty\" shot given in the belly-- so interesting!  Glad to hear it didn't hurt.  Maybe it's b/c we have more subcutaneous tissue there??  If shots are given SC (:under the skin\") it's less painful than in the muscle (like in an arm). I'll have to look it up in one of my nursing books sometime...  OK, curiosity got the best of me and I checked.  It IS given SC!  So the abdomen is one good spot for that type of shot (diabetics give insulin there all the time).  And our bellies have more SC tissue than our arms, so that's why it hurts less there.  D1-- maybe you can do yours there?? LJ13--  I totally agree on the MUGAs.  I had one, too.  I'm so impressed your EF was in the 70s.  Mine was 65% and I thought that was good for someone who really does no exercise  other than chase her kids around!  Note to self-- I think I'll be starting some kind of exercise now since you guys are all so hung-ho.  I'm inspired... Vettegal:  Don't fret about being one of the last to start.  I don't start until the 16th, and I'm doing herceptin for a year (starting with my TC regimen on the 16th), so I'll be around for a while :)  WV-- congrats on the negative BRCA!! All right, I found all 29 names.  Some I haven't seen in a while.. so update me if you want to add more to our list other than your name.  They include: LBCurtis2007 Carstell sunshine99 sheebas A few started early December, and I also don't have much on them: KMK Sharon68 Patti5: started 12/10, doing AC x4 then T x4 For everybody else.. see the next post....",

So, last night was my Look Good, Feel Better class.  It was very informative.  Learned how to draw eyebrows on!  So cool.  And basically just relearned make-up application (which was good since I don't wear much).  She also showed us how to tie scarves and wraps on our heads-- I think this was the best thing to learn for me.  Oh, and how to clean your wigs-- real important.  And to be careful about any heat when wearing a wig b/c it will ruin it (think oven, toasters, dishwasher heat, etc.)  Anyway, if you can go... I would go.  It was a nice evening of info, and FREE makeup!  I gotta run, I'm still at work.  I'll check in on all the JJs tonight. Kathy",

Today I picked up my wigs-- I still like them, thank God.  Hope they look as fab when I'm bald.  It was also the dh's b-day (#38), so he had the day off.  We sent the rugrats to preschool all day and just hung out-- went to lunch, got ready to go away tomorrow (to see dad), went and looked as Harleys.  Funny story there.  First off, I am anything but a biker babe.  More the quiet, minivan type.  But I guess I do have a wild streak.  Anyway, we used to joke that when we turned 40, I'd get a boob job (I never really thought I'd do it, just said it for his benefit), and he'd get his Harley.  He used to have a bike before we were married, but he sold it to buy me my engagement ring (which is down-right beautiful if I must say so).  So along comes BC this year and I'm 36.  I get my boob job (thank you mastectomy... not the way I had wanted to get boobs), and he still has no Harley (and he really wanted this much more than I wanted boobs).  Maybe I'll cave in if all goes well this next year and he can get one a year early. And now I'm thinking I might get some leather pants and I bustier to show off the new rack!  Hahaha! OK, quick hellos, and then gotta get the kids to bed and finish packing... D1:  got sista2 on the list.  Man, we are a huge group!  Thank God there's 2 of us to keep it straight.  Once chemo-brain kicks in we'll hopefully have 1 full brain, right?  Also, do you think your itchy hands are a neuropathy.  I know the taxanes can cause weird peripheral sensations.  Just wondering... LJ13:  keep us posted on the HER2 status.  There are 3 of us already (I'm one) who are positive.  Herceptin will be added to your regimen for a year if you are +.  Also glad to hear #2 went well for you this week. WVgirl:  I agree with SIS Kimberly on the job situation.  DanaC;  I'm yet another example of someone who had surgery and then chemo much later.  My lumpectomy was at the end of August and my mastectomy was Oct.5-- chemo starts next week for me.  Many have already commented on the BRCA test, so won't add.  I'll just say that you darn well should qualify and insurance should cover.  Try going trhough a genetic counselor if you have access-- it helps with insurance coverage.  As for clinicals.. it really will depend on your energy level.  But also consider what type of patients you'll be around.  You don't want to catch anything from them! CarolC:  we start chemo the same day!  You definitely were right to insist on getting info beforehand.  I can't believe they thought they could tell you the day of!  I'm nervous as the day gets nearer, how about you?  Even despite everything I've read here I'm totally paranoid about what SEs I'll have and if I'm prepared enough for them.  Wish I could have my own nurse right here... Carol (Golfer):  All Hail EMLA!  Glad it worked.  I can use it on round #2, but not one.  I'm still gonna act dumb and ask my onc the day beforehand about it. Sista2:  I'm doing cytoxan, taxotere, herceptin.  Is carboplatin the same as cytoxan?  I don't think it is.  Otherwise we are very similar. Gotta run.  Kathy",

OK, so I'll get right to it... today was no sweat thanks to all of you who went before me. So all you girls still waiting or round one, relax!  I didn't sleep well last night but more b/c I can't get comfortable b/c my port's on the side I like to sleep on and it's still tender.  But I was up, showered, ate oatmeal and AJ (to help the surgery constipation), dropped the kids off to preschool and the dh and I headed to chemo!  Our infusion room is huge and open, but you can pick your recliner and get settled in.  I got a little teary just thinking of the port access-- but it was painless!!!  My nurse used lidocaine spray and I felt nothing at all.  I intend on doing this each time as I don't have to pay for EMLA then and the spray is not messy.  Next I did my Aloxi (anti-nausea), saline flush, Taxotere (had no reaction, yay!), cytoxan (had a very mild \"dirt\" taste on my mouth but I just sucked on ice the whole time and it wasn't bad), herceptin (this was the longest infusion 1 1/2 hrs.), flushed, deaccessed my port and 5 hrs. later I'm done with round one.  Went to lunch and had a little chicken ceasar salad.  Picked up some Zantac on the way home (the decadron is not making my belly happy and I'd rather head it off now vs. later when it hurts).  So I made it girls! My plan for the next few days is to be cautiously optimistic.  I doubt I'll get through it unscathed but I plan on mind over matter-- if I think I'll be ok, then I will be. And I've got my arsenal here in case I'm wrong.  Tonight I'm taking decadron, Zantac, and my poop medicine.  I'd like to walk some on the treadmill, too. I'll be back on tomorrow to report in again.  One down, 3 to go!!  (I don't count the year of herceptin until I'm on to just that alone... puts it in a better perspective I think).",

It's amazing what sleeping in your own bed can do for you!  I'll be home all day checking things out here and going through the piles of stuff on my desk that accumulated while I was gone.  DH literally just kept the kids fed and clean and got the essentials taken care of-- but I must say I've got a good one b/c he really did pretty well.  He got most of the house cleaned and all the laundry and grocery shopping done.  The kids were bathed with brushed teeth and hair.  Wow! Some good info from Cathy-CA about the Topo2a test from UCLA's research.  One thing to remember about research studies... you really need to know how to read and analyze them.  I've done some research with my master's degree and it really is pretty tough (I hated it actually).  A good study has large sample size (not just 50 people, I mean hundreds or thousands), it has to be reproducible (so others need to do the SAME thing and find the same results, at least 1-2 more times for it to be \"true\" or valid)-- just to name a few things.  Plus you need to look at the statistical \"stuff\" it includes.  Cathy's point about the purpose of the study is important, too.  So a study might show something \"groundbreaking\" but not really be a good study or have no statistical merit.  Take any new info with a grain of salt, ladies.  Until you see it again and again, or until it becomes a \"standard\", it's just another piece of info out there unless you can verify the research's validity.  For instance... I had a staining done at UPenn on my tumor-- this is what found my \"multifocal IDC\" and prompted everyone to change my tx plan from no chemo to chemo.  Now, the staining I had done is not standard protocol.  BUT UPenn is highly respected and renouned for its cancer research.  They are cutting edge!  They have done this stain on thousands of people and even though it hasn't become mainstream yet in the US, it's almost a UPenn standard (they've verified it's valid, accurate, etc.)-- I know it's a good thing and it gave more info that is beneficial. DianeB:  Glad you are less stressed, but don't just let it go until later.  It sucks that you have to do this on top of fight cancer, but it can affect your entire future really.  And remember, you have a long future ahead!  Bankruptcy is not something you want to do... it is actually getting harder to do, and it can take a very long time to recoup losses.  Some people never return to good credit afterwards.  Please don't let that happen to you.  Most financial institutions want to see that you do something right now, rather than just let it go.  If you think you're having a hard time now, you do not want to see what can happen if you don't address this now.  I would highly suggest you take some action now even if it takes time b/c you aren't feeling well and can't do things as quickly as you like.  Make a partial payment at least on a bill and include a letter (even copy the same one and send to all) about why this is happening now, include your docs' names and numbers for them to call if they need to.  I'd even consider your family's generous suggestion-- maybe not exactly what they want to do with their mortgages, but how about getting their help with the bills for now?  That's what family is for!  So much easier to repay your \"debt\" to them rather than a creditor.  My mother (who is 61 and lives alone) had offered me money out of her retirement savings when we were scrambling for a plan.  I decided this was a last resort only, but it WAS an option.  Remember, you always have a choice, you just might not like all the options in front of you.  Choose wisely, young padawan!  OK, sorry to get on my soapbox with you.  Just don't want to see anything bad happen to a fellow Jewel when I can open my big mouth and say something that could help.  And by the way, I can't believe that \"cow\" at you cancer center!!  I'd like to kick her in the udders :)  People say the stupidest things sometimes.  And I too love the neupogen I got in the hospital.  NO aches or pains.  But it did burn a bit when injected.  I'm trying the Neulasta next round only b/c it's once and done (I hate needles, like D1).  If I have problems with it though, I'm back to the neupogen for the last 2 rounds.  They said it's for 10 days after each chemo-- how long do you do yours?",

      "Content": "Feb 1, 2008 06:43AM KathyL wrote: Good morning Jewels! Boy, did I have a lot to read from yesterday AM.  OK, the best news I think is about periods/tampons.  I have suffered through almost 2 weeks now of bleeding and using pads which I hate.  I really don't think I'm going to be putting myself at risk of infection with tampons after reading your posts-- I don't leave them in all day for God's sake, or cause trauma when putting them in!  It looks like nature is finally going to give me a break now, but next time (if there is one next month), I'm going back to \"plugs\"!  Sheesh, one less thing to make me hate my body! So anyway, before my shout-outs... yesterday did not turn out to be the cool girls' day I'd hoped.  I ended up having to hang out at home until lunchtime for my onc's office to call back about my eye swelling.  Turns out it IS probably the taxotere (great, another SE), like you said D1.  By the evening my eyes were better, but I had \"cankles\" (ya know, a calf plus an ankle...).  I didn't even get any swelling when I was pregnant, so this was new to me and oh so pretty.  I put my feet up last night and just plan on wearing long pants from now on to cover it.  Gross!  The eyes were better this AM.  Cankles will reappear as the day goes on I'm sure.  Sexy! Hope this doesn't get worse with each round... So I missed lunch with my friend-- we rescheduled for next Monday or Tuesday.  Went to my PS appointment with my other friend.  So funny... we went in the room together and the ps came in.  We're both there in our little paper tops-- the \"Boobsie Twins\"-- cracking up.  My boob is healing fine and I'll get my nipple this spring/summer once chemo's done!  yay!  She got her b/l fills and did great.  Hopefully she'll get her exchange in March if all goes well.  We were just such a sight laughing and comparing incisions, etc.  But the my hair started coming out more and my hairdresser can't get me in until Monday.  So I had a mild meltdown over that until my friend (another one) and I came up with plan B-- her place can do it today or tomorrow if the hair starts falling out in clumps or looks bad.  I'm gonna re-evaluate after a shower today.  Monday I can get the wigs shaped then.  It was just an up-down kinda day and not as much fun as I'd planned.  But oh well, today's a new day.  It's rainy here in DE, so I plan on staying in until I have to get the kids from preschool.  The dh is being a bit of a DH today (I think he has HIS period maybe...  hahaha), but he's at work now and going out tonight to play poker. Jackie, Sunshine: congrats on finishing round 1.  I hope the next few days go smoothly with little or no SEs. Sunshine: I agree with Cathy-Ca about the nausea/compazine.  I'm doing TC also (plus herceptin) and got Aloxi... I had no vomiting and very little nausea, and I have a weak stomach normally.  I did not have to take any Zofran, I just wore Sea Bands for a day and was fine.  But don't wait to take your compazine if you don't have a good belly. I also have the tea tree oil for my nails.  I use it twice a day; it stinks, but so far no nail problems. I also use OPI nail strengthener once a week. LJ13:  I was cracking up reading about little tits!  I was barely an A cup before all this cancer stuff.  After my lumpectomy, I had DCIS in my margins and my surgeon said if she re-excised, I'd look pretty bad, so I had to do a left mastectomy.  I got the right augmented at the same time-- I'm now a full B/C cup and loving the new \"girls\"!  I did not know that the could do recon. with a lumpectomy-- nice option for you if they can do it. CarolC and Maz:  We started chemo #1 the same day.  So here I am at day 17 today and the hair's still there so far, but starting to come out.  I think Monday will be my shaving day.  Stay tuned... and can't wait to hear about your hair since we're the same day. Kris60: See my notes about Sea Bands.  You can get them at drugstores for about $5.  They work very well for nausea and that \"sea-sick\" feeling.  I plan on using them again for round #2. RN2teach and Deb102307:  Hope today goes well for you both.  Deb, I think they'll still do it if your counts are OK and you don't have a fever.  Let us know! Dana:  Hey!  So glad to hear from you and with some good news about insurance.  I agree with Cathy-CA about TC vs AC.  And I think your best chemo day might be Tuesday.  And you need a new man, honey.  I feel for you-- you deserve better! WVGirl: I've been thinking about you. I feel so bad reading about your dh/DH.  Keep venting to us.  I'd still consider going to someone for you.  I don't know your situation entirely, but I'd hate to hear about things getting worse; the lack of communication can wear you down.  You need to take care of you-- physically and mentally. Gonna go shower and check the hair follicles!   ",

Julie:  Girl, you're on EVERYTHING!  Can they adjust doses of meds, or even your chemo to make it more tolerable??? Another thought:  IV fluids the day after with maybe some IV anti-emetics instead of PO.  IV seems to work better and faster overall than PO.  Zofran can be given IV.  I hope they find something that works for you b/c it has to be better than what you're doing now.

I've been saying to my friends for sometime now that chemo is very much like being preggers (but no cute baby at the end): you feel nauseous, gain weight, retain fluid, crave weird things, aches, can't sleep, breakout-- what's going on here?  I've had cravings for soup and p'nut butter.  Paula:  Your co-workers sound so cool!  I've gotten one of those fruit bouquets before and they are sooo good.  Enjoy! Carol:  Ditto on your co-workers.  Just as nice getting clothes!  Good luck today. Julie:  Interesting what your onc will be doing.  I hope it works.  And I agree that the extra Aloxi might do the trick.  It's really more of an anti-emetic than Reglan (which is a motility drug:  it moves things through your stomach faster, but doesn't really address the \"vomit center\" of the brain that I know of.)  We used to use Reglan a lot in peds for kids with severe reflux on top of zantac. Kris60:  love your sense of humor!  your posts had me LOL.  ride out the SEs today-- hope you feel better soon.  Deb:  Hope your pooper slows down.  Hang in there and eat some yogurt!",

D1: OK, remember I am NOT an onc nurse at all.  The concept of cording I don't completely get.  I've tried googling it and haven't found much to help me.  But I had it at the beginning, right after my mastectomy for sure (confirmed by docs and PT).  My PT said it happens from the tendons \"shortening\" from surgery and \"matting down\", which happens from underuse of the arm.  It was painful and numb-feeling all at the same time-- hard to describe.  But my PT said after stretching and use of the arm, the cording would resolve, and it did.  I do remember her saying it also had to do with when lymph nodes are removed and the flow of lymph is hindered... the lymph channels do not flow like they should and that contributes to cording.  So, with your LE, I'd say it's really possible you have it.  And I absolutely remember being able to feel the \"cord\" starting at my armpit (VERY painful to touch) and ending somewhere in the bicep area; I think that's the actual tendon if I remember correctly.  And I also definitely remember her saying that as the cording \"unmats\" and resolves (for lack of a better way to describe it) you can sometimes hear an audible snap-- sounds like you did! I remember her telling me this b/c I thanked her for telling me, otherwise I'd be sure I screwed something up while stretching at home.  Don't know for sure if that's good news for you or not (it sounds like it could be), but I know my cording did resolve with PT over about 4 weeks, and got less painful along the way.  I can't even tell where the cord is/was now. And yes, ds has continued on his peeing streak I am happy to say!",

Kimberly, I think you're right... it just brought to light something that's always been in the back of my mind (and maybe a lot of ours).  I've decided once chemo's done to SLAM the door on this chapter of my life, don't live in fear (it can eat you up), move forward, and DON'T LOOK BACK!  Someone told me this once and I think it may be a good mindset for me to not dwell on the negatives. And I think I'll need to remember also how many SURVIVORS are still around, and not think about the what ifs so much.  It's not going to be easy, and will take some time, but I can do it.  Too much to live for to focus on the alternative. Two great quotes to pass on to my fellow gems; hope they are uplifting, not sad...1)  from Joan Baez... \"You don't get to choose how you're going to die.  Or when.  You can only decide how you're going to live.  Now.\" 2) from Elisabeth Kubler-Ross: \"It is only when we truly know and understand that we have a limited time on Earth- and that we have no way of knowing when our time is up- that we will begin to live each day to the fullest, as if it was the only one we had.\" OK, enough.. I've gotta get my shout outs done! D1:  Glad your last round went well!  They tried to push the Ativan on me again, and I refused it.  Don't need no stinkin' Ativan!  Hope your nails hang on, sounds like they will :)  And how nice, no onc visit until May!  WooHoo!!!  But it sounds like you'll still be quite busy.  And we'd better still hear from you regarding the next leg of your journey.  I don't think this thread should be just for chemo-- it's just how we all met and started to bond. Speaking of which, OLE... I agree, you DO deserve all the credit that the girls have mentioned.  This thread is AMAZING!!! Dana:  Prayers will never end for you, sweetie!  Did they tell you if it's breast mets to liver or liver cancer separately?  I've got you written down to start Tuesday on Taxol/herceptin every three weeks.  Do you know how many rounds they're going to do yet?  I'm sure they'll do a few and then rescan you to see what's up with your liver.  I agree with I think it was Cathy-CA about the HER2 website-- I've checked it out and like it (I'm HER2+ and doing a year of herceptin, too).  There's also some threads on here that focus on HER2+.  Herceptin is really kicking some butt for us HER2+ girls, and working very well with mets (if that's what you're facing on the liver).  I've also read some very positive things that are in the works for further treatment for HER2+ cancers and even a possible vaccine down the road.  Keep your head up! Julie:  Sorry to hear you've joined some of the other Jewels in the back spasms.  You just can't get a break-- I think you are the SE queen.  You could write a book about all of them!  Hang tough, girl.  RN2Teach (Paula):  I've been told Taxotere is the easier drug in general for reactions, SEs, etc. (vs. Taxol).  Thank God I got this one I guess :) LJ:  Glad T/H #2 went well for you.  Dana is probably glad to hear it, too! Kimberly:  You're baaaack!  You are just such a whirlwind when you feel good-- I love reading your posts.  I know I'll be there by next weekend (though not quite as energy-filled as you). Sista2: OK, we'd NEVER kick out a fellow Jewel!  No worries.  And as for the fear of the Taxotere-- I've hopefully taken that crown now and all the associated drama that goes with it.  So the rest of the Jewels should be safe now.  And God forbid I'm wrong... I have to tell you the nurses are on you like a fly on sh*t.  My team was so great that even though it was scary... I knew I was in good hands and would be fine.  Now that I've done it twice... I totally know what to look for and know they'll take care of it.  Hey, I didn't even need the oxygen this time-- progress!!! For drinks:  Have you tried teas or ginger ale yet? Sheshe:  I've done great with my decadron and Aloxi with my T/C.  I am also extremely allergic to compazine-- so I have Zofran on hand at home in case the nausea would hit... but I haven't needed it at all so far (knock on wood).  I also wear Sea Bands for about a day each round (usually day 4 for me), which is probably when the Aloxi has worn off.  I don't know that I'd be real eager to stop the decadron b/c it's what helps combat the nausea and also the SEs of the Taxanes that are common (I take 8 mg twice a day the day before/of/after each chemo round).  I'd urge your new onc to stick with what works for you so far-- don't rock the boat!  Speak up for yourself and give them the reasons why, which are all valid.  Catch you all later.  I hope to not be too out of it until tomorrow. ",

Can't believe what a PITA insurance can be.  I agree, you have to really pay attention to the EOBs and bills that come in.  If I owe something, I keep the EOB until the bill comes in to verify, and a lot of times I'll call my ins. co. in the meantime to find out why they wouldn't cover something.  So far, I've been able to get everything covered but the expected copays for the hospital admit and office visits.  Dana:  We're both 1970 babies!  I'll be 38 in December.  I'm thinking about you and your big day tomorrow.  Did you get a port?",

I have some more things on my to-do list I could knock off also.  It's just nice to have a day where I feel semi-normal and don't HAVE to do anything if I don't want to.  Gotta enjoy these moments as I'll be going back to FT work once chemo's done. Dana: I don't want to be pushy, but I'd consider a port, girl.  If you're doing herceptin like me, that's a stick every 3 weeks for a year.  Ouch!  I have great veins, but didn't want to be stuck that much or risk ruining my one good arm.  I love my little port now :)  If I were just doing the 4 rounds of chemo, I'd probably not have done a port, but it was the herceptin for a year that pushed me over the edge.  Just a thought... For the mouth, I do: Biotene toothpaste and mouthrinse twice a day.  Each morning I mix up a batch of baking soda rinse (1 tsp BS to 8 oz water) and use this every 3 hrs. throughout the day to rinse (rec. by my onc).  I haven't had any mouth issues yet with this regimen.  I do slack off on the BS rinse after the first 2 weeks, but restart full force the day after chemo each time. Vettegal:  Great pic.  And I also like your hat!  I think chemopause has hit me too.  I wonder if that's why I keep having the heart palpitations?",

About the b-days... post or PM me even if you had your b-day already this year girls.  I'll be keeping track for the future!  Thanks CHJ. Tinalee:  Good to hear T#1 went smoothly.

Thank God.  I didn't sleep well last night, but have lots of time to rest today, and I will. Carol:  My onc checks my breasts (as well as the usual stuff) with each exam so far (every three weeks).  My surgeon I see less often now (about every 3-6 months), but she also checks them.  I've been doing my checks again which are hard b/c everything feels different now-- guess I have to learn the new me.  Hope you have a nice vaca.  I'm jealous as I won't get away until August. Dana: I feel like I can't ignore all that's been posted.  But all I really have to say is don't be so hard on yourself.  You expressed an opinion that some did not agree with-- this is all part of life.  You apologized for offending anyone, they accepted-- now let's all move on.  We can be open here.  If we treat each other kindly, then all is right in the world as I see it.  I don't think any less of you or anyone else for what's been said here-- we're all Jewels, and I like everyone of us. The fog is rolling in girls, so I'm gonna post this and then go rest.  I have the upcoming week's list (it's a full one!) that I'll post later when I have some more energy.",

At least the voice is almost back today. Anyway, dh is out bowling and the kids are thankfully sound asleep-so now I finally have Jewel time!  TexRN:  Good to hear your update.  It gives us all a sense of hope for \"after\".  I'll bet not seeing your onc until July is both great and scary. About strangers' comments:  haven't had any yet.  Just a few sad glances which I just return with a smile.  I enjoy reading all your interactions and find it all pretty interesting how naïve/ignorant people are about BC.  Oprah!!!! D1:  Glad things turned out positive for the cyst drainage (even though you had to go back to your previous place).  Hope it goes well tomorrow and it gives you some relief in your arm pain.  I, too, was dx in August last year-can't believe this has all been going on for 7 months now. Vettegal:  I've found I have to shave my legs about once a month.  PITA!  Congrats tomorrow--- LAST ROUND!!! Cathy-CA:  I agree that no child should have to go through this. One area of peds nursing I never did was oncology and I doubt I could do it after all this.  I'd have the empathy, but it would break my heart as a mother, and also having been through this and knowing what they'd have to endure might be more than I could handle. SIS Kimberly:  Hope you have nice get-away to Tahoe.  Can't wait to hear about it.  Carol:  So cool that you are getting to meet people from other threads.  Looks like you're having a great time. D326:  It's nice to know we are helping others while we are chatting and getting through this experience.  I hope some of our comments will help you.  Try to maintain a positive outlook (you WILL get through this), and get any and all kinds of support to help you out.  Best of luck in your journey! Jenn51:  Sorry to hear about your friend; it sounds just awful. Sheebas:  Glad to see you again, but so sad that you're feeling lousy.  I hope you can get some positive news from your docs.  Keep us posted. Sheshe:  Yikes!  How terrible.  I hope you and your arm feel better soon.  Hope it was just an infiltrate that will clear up. OK, caught up.  Good luck to all tomorrow's Gems!  Night, night from little DE and the youngest (I think) Jewel (but definitely not the littlest though).",

I also signed up for a Look Good, Feel Better class and am pretty excited about what they can teach me to look less yucky during chemo.  Got my \"cranial prosthesis\" RX, too and will start shopping after Christmas.  So much info at once.  Oh, and I got a good book--- \"the chemo cookbook\"-- at our cancer center's library. I'll share that, too as I browse through it or try stuff.  i can get anyone the true title and author if you want to look it up, but it came highly recommended to me and so far a quick glance looks promising.  Gotta go.  I'll check in later. P.S.  Welcome Lori to our group.  So sorry to hear of your recurrence.  We have a great group here that will be supportive for you.  What is your HER2 status?",

My update:  they saw \"something\" on the U/S today; no one is sure, or is saying, what that \"something\" is.  The surgeon is hopeful and \"confident\" it's just fibrous tissue, but I'm going to be biopsied tomorrow at 5pm.  Should have results by my follow-up on the 19th.",

      "Content": "Apr 8, 2008 08:17PM - edited Apr 8, 2008 08:20PM by KathyL Hello all!  Back from the lounge early today!  I was actually done with everything by noon, which is a record for me (went to lunch again with another friend afterwards, of course-so not home until later in the afternoon)).  I guess when the TC is not a factor things are soooo much faster.  Herceptin only takes 1 ½ hrs.  I had bloodwork done today and saw my onc before the infusion-my numbers are in the sh*tter!  But apparently my onc is blind or I am officially a freak/psycho, b/c he said \"everything looks great\"!  They were the lowest they've ever been (excluding the hospital visit).  He said after 4 rounds of chemo, they are fine. No shot for the RBCs, not even iron.  OK, dude, if you say so...  WBCs were low normal.  I did get neulasta, right??  I guess if he's not worried, I shouldn't be.  I'm just used to seeing much higher numbers.  And his NP was a little snippy today.  Set me off from the start of the whole day.  I very much felt like I was being pushed out the door to my GP now that I'm done with chemo.  And she basically blew off the fact that I've gained almost 10 pounds (\"by our records it's only about 4\"  \"well by mine it's 10\", and I don't like it regardless).  On one hand she's giving me a sheet telling me to not gain weight b/c it can contribute to recurrence, on the other she's saying I'm fine and looking at me like I'm nuts.  Aaaaaggghhh-which is it, beeyotch?  She also said that most people gain weight after BC (thanks for that inspiring tidbit!), and \"that's just how it is\".  Was not happy with her and her info (maybe I'm being sensitive...) and vowed to work my #ss off until the 10 lbs is gone despite her info that I'll forever not fit in my jeans again. Thank God my onc is much warmer and fuzzier!  Basically today I learned:  I'll do herceptin every 3 weeks for a total of 18 rounds (5 are done as of today!).  In June I'll get a repeat MUGA, August a mammogram (my anniversary), and I'll see him again in 3 months.  My sx (fluid retention and eye twitching) should resolve in the coming weeks.  Forgot to even ask about the chemo-brain-- what irony!  Wish I felt better about it all, but I feel kind of odd-empty almost, like I don't know what to do now.  Does that make sense?  I guess it's that post-chemo let-down of not seeing someone every 3 weeks to check on you and ask about SEs, do an exam, etc.  Sorry to ramble.  I think I'm going crazy... Tina:  I can partially relate to your friend's situation.  I remember the sinking feeling in my stomach when I was told that they'd changed their mind after 3 months of one plan that didn't include any chemo, to a new one that did.  It's so hard to switch gears when your mind is set on no chemo and every fiber of your body doesn't want to do it.  I hope she does well. Julie:  I am so happy that you only have to go through your chemo SE's one more time.  You have just had such a rough journey.  Glad you're back, albeit for about a week. Carol:  Hope you did well today and the stomach settled down (and the GI distress hasn't moved south on you!). Maz:  Got your update.  I think the next to last tx seems to be mentally the hardest.  You CAN do it though-hang in there!  Hope Thursday goes well my former bar buddy!  It felt strange to me doing a tx today when I've been Wednesdays all along. D1:  You should definitely be playing a lottery with those recent winnings of yours.  If not, pass on the good karma to somebody else!  Hahaha! Sorry to hear you're already pink.  Keep lotioning that tata! Vettegal:  Is that a wig???  You look great!",

Paula:  Glad you liked the book.  Like Carol said, check out the website for the rest of her story.  It's sad, but I learned so much from her. Maz:  Try to focus on Wednesday and the positive of finishing chemo.  I know Val will live on in your memories and will certainly be by your side Wednesday.  You will always have her as your BC guardian angel now. It's gloomy and cool here in DE, raining.  Wish I could pull the covers over my head and wake up tomorrow instead.  I had a meeting scheduled today for my new job, and my car decided to act up.  Some warning came on about the engine coolant, and if I kept driving the engine could seize up!  So I turned back home, missed my meeting, freaked out on dh (who had to come home and fix the damn car since I have to have it tomorrow for my herceptin infusion day and we didn't know how major the problem was), and I'm sitting here sulking and having a crummy day.  I managed to call and reschedule my meeting-so not a big deal, I was just actually looking forward to doing something with the new job, ya know?  While I was feeling sorry for myself, I looked in the mirror and saw some more eyelashes came out with the cry, and half my right eyebrow is also gone.  Oh yeah, and to top it all off, Aunt Flo can't decide whether she's coming or not today (drip, drip, drip).  AAAggg!!!!  The ringing in my ear is driving me crazy, too, and today I'm really dizzy from the pressure.  I am so hating myself today.  Can't wait for tomorrow and a new attitude adjustment. Sorry to vent, but I do feel better now.  Got the car straightened out, apologized to dh (who is a saint I think for dealing with his one-boobed, one-eyebrowed, mostly-bald, half-loony wife!), and took some Motrin for the ear pressure.  I'm seeing my GP tomorrow after the herceptin infusion in the AM, so hopefully she can tell me what's up with my ear.  I am soooo impatient these days. Hope you girls are faring better today.",

Saturday was the memorial for my friend's mother.  It was absolutely beautiful.  My friend, her father, and brother put together a slide show of pictures of her mom from her birth to her death.  She was a remarkable woman.  She'd visited all 50 states (went to #50-Hawaii-in 2006).  She helped start the Wellness Community in our hometown/area.  And she also liked to raise monarch butterflies from egg to butterfly.  She even grew the milkweed they liked to eat.  They had a church service, and at the end of it we all went outside.  Her dad put the urn (? she was cremated... not sure what the box is called) in a special receptacle in a wall outside of the church, and then my friend and her brother let a whole cage of monarch butterflies loose over the wall.  It was just beautiful.  Needless to say, it was an emotional day for so many reasons.  The pictures of her bald during her chemo were just beautiful works of art, and made me teary.  But I know my friend's mom was looking down proudly on how nicely her children and husband made tribute to her that day.  And doing it all on Mother's Day weekend was perfect. The rest of the day I visited with my dad, and then my mom.  We got home late last night.  Today I got to sleep in (woo hoo... 7:30!  That's good for me).  Dh cleaned the whole house.  He and the kids got me a really pretty pink pearl BC bracelet.  Will be wearing that to work tomorrow. Another busy week ahead, but it seems that I'm feeling more normal the busier I become.  Gotta run, time for lunch.  Will post the upcoming week's schedule soon.",

I'll of course tell her about this great site! The new job is going really well so far.  I'll get my first paycheck Friday-- that should make me smile even more!  They have been so supportive and it really was a good move for me right now.  Surprisingly, my \"old\" job is also coming through in ways I did not expect.  I guess it's good all around.  dh comes home tomorrow night.  He probably won't get here until midnight.  I've really missed him, as have the kids.  It'll be nice to have him home again.  My mom went home tonight.  She was a big help and it was nice to have her around for a few days.  I'll see her again in 2 weeks when I do my Relay.  Tomorrow I truly have a day off (no meetings!), so it should be nice to do things at my own pace.  I'm meeting a friend to help her find a prosthetic (sp?) boob.  Her expander did not work on the one side, so she has to wait until after rads to see what our ps can do for her in reconstructing. It's nice to read how everyone is doing, and how busy we all have been! Kimberly, Julie, and Tina:  Please let me know what questions you have about the exchange surgery.  Kimberly, I found I did very well afterwards.  I barely had to take any pain meds (barely one day of Percocet; I mostly took Advil), and really was pretty comfortable sleeping.  I did not need to prop myself up like I did (for weeks) after the mastectomy.  Recover was only a long weekend, and then I was back to work.  You guys will be amazed at how much better the implants feel!  June 4 I get my tat and then I'm done.  So tonight I tuned into to AI.  Will be interesting to see who wins.  I'd like to see David Cook. Also watching DWTS while I type.  No surprise who the final 2 are.  Though I liked #3 a lot.  I still think Kristi will win it all. Thinking of you all tonight.  Hugs to everyone.",

Well, my quick update...  last night was dd's preschool graduation.  They were so cute, and dd did a great job with her poem she memorized.  It was definitely a proud mama moment!  The school just did a spectacular job with the program-something you just don't see all the time for preschoolers.  But, oh boy, did the emotions hit me harder than I expected.  I just got all choked up thinking about how lucky I was to be there to see her, and how I know someday at her HS and college graduations I'll savor those moments, too.  I never was this sappy before, but I guess life has a new perspective now, and all these milestones are that much more precious.  I honestly feel like I look at each day now as a gift, and want to savor the moments as much as I can.  I guess what I'm trying to say is, I hope we can all find happiness.  I wish each of my Jewel Sisters happiness like I felt yesterday watching my dd!  Life is so precious, and we deserve to be crazy happy with each day we have.",

Hair... yes, it's growing like crazy \"down there\".  And straight and fuzzy.  So weird.  Sorry girls if that's TMI.  You know how D1 and I can be.  Nothing's sacred... As for head hair, my hairdresser said to start conditioning now.  I've got about ½\"of hair (I think), and she said new hair can be fragile and break easily as it comes in, so conditioning is necessary!  Just thought I'd pass on that tip.  I've switched from Nioxin to Redken shampoo with a deep conditioner. Carla:  Sorry I missed that Friday was your last tx day.  Don't know how that happened... can I blame it on chemo-brain???  Hope your Relay went well.  June 6 must've been national ACS Relay day or something, b/c I know of several that happened then (mine included).  I guess several Jewels got their exercise this weekend.

I just read further, and it sounds like it was an exciting night--- thanks to the weather!  Sounds like it ended up being a fun night regardless.  Life IS good! So, girls, sorry I've been gone for a few days.  Friday night was amazing.  The heat wasn't too bad-upper 80s, but the humidity creeped up.  We started with the Survivor/Caregiver Dinner at 5:30.  A catered spread under a tent with big fans (ahhh).  Very tasty food.  My mom, dad, and stepmom joined me (they all came down from PA) and dh, dd, and ds.  There was a kids' area nearby with slides, and rides.  They loved it!  Anyway, at the dinner, we got to sign big letters which were put up at the track later on... they spelled CURE.  My dad got a pic later of my signature on the \"C\".  Next to it on the track were big letters spelling HOPE which lit up at night.  Dh got a pic of that I think. (Yeah, I don't have any pictures downloaded yet, but will be sure to post them when I do).  At the dinner, survivors got their pictures taken (I did mine topless!  I only had a hat on when the sun was up) and we got to write our \"story\"-both got sent to our state legislators for support for state funding for cancer.  Opening ceremonies were at 7.  I found my \"boob buddy\"-my friend I've talked about on here before-- and we stood together.  There was a speech by another survivor (breast CA) who had been in the herceptin clinical trial 3 years ago.  She's looking good.  Next each survivor got a dove (actually a trained homing pigeon).  We all let them go together.  It was amazing.  This was my favorite part and I can't wait to do it again next year.  I was petrified at first that the bird was going to peck me and/or poop on me-but he was a good birdy and just sat still until I released him.  All the birds flew together and swooped over the track a few times, then landed behind a tree where their trainer was.  My dad got lots of pictures; I can't wait to see them.  I was a little teary after that.  Next we started the walk with our caregivers, then our teams.  I have no idea how many laps I did, but I know I did a lot.  At 9, they did the luminaria ceremony.  Very sad, as it really was to remember those that had died (although they were also a tribute to survivors, most of the stuff said was for those who'd passed).  I had found a luminaria for a girl I used to work with who was not much older than me-I had no idea she'd had BC let alone had died from it.  Really choked me up to see that.  There were so many luminarias, I couldn't find but one of mine.  But a slide show ran for a while of all the tributes on the luminarias, so I got pictures of that-and have one of the January Jewels'!!! Dh and I stayed until about 10:30 with my mom, then headed home (the kids had left earlier with my dad and stepmom).  Saturday AM we went back, and I walked some more laps.  I brought donuts and coffee for my team.  The kids did a kids' lap and got free t-shirts and goodies.  Dd had to leave for her recital rehearsal.  It was so hot and humid, we decided to leave around 10.  I missed the closing ceremony at 11, but I got to meet up with dd and my stepmom for rehearsal.  It was just such a great experience overall; I'm glad I did it even though I didn't stay overnight (maybe next year).  But as D1 said, just remids me how happy I am to be alive. Spent today cleaning, etc. to get ready for the week.  The kids start \"summer camp\" at preschool tomorrow.  dd has her final performance for gymnastics Tuesday night, and her recital is Saturday-so this week will be busy too, but not as bad as last week.  I have my next herceptin infusion Tuesday afternoon, too.  The schedule... Monday:         I think...Carol's last chemo! (Unless this got postponed b/c of her prior setback).  Tuesday:         Kris 60 #8 of 12 weekly T Wednesday:   Wing #11 of 12 weekly T Saturday:        Happy 49th Birthday to Deb102307!! Kris and Wendy... the end is in sight!",

Cathy-CA:  Maybe it is the age difference.  I had several docs tell me no estrogens.  I'll have to ask my onc when I see him again in July. Kimberly:  Hope you're having fun in Chicago.  My step brother lives there.  Someday I'll get there, too.  So hard to travel with little kids. Tina:  Yup... sounds like definite cording.  Mine resolved quickly (2-3 months) with PT, most of which I did myself at home after they showed me what to do.  No snap, as D1 thought-- but they told me that could happen. D1:  You've been a busy beaver.  Nice that you got \"the dress\".  Hope she still likes it next year. Julie:  Yup, settled on a cleaning service.  I'll be calling them this week.  I hope to get my first cleaning done the week of July4, then have them come every other week.  Yahoo! Carol:  Rads sounds like it was a pain in the arm!  Hope things get better since the actual rads will be much shorter than all the prep. So, my drought ended.  Don't get jealous, girls; it was totally all about him.  Had to give in at some point, he was driving me crazy.  So, I guess that's his quota until when....?  maybe vacation in August (hahaha).   It never works that way. Today the kids started swim lessons.  My little fishies.  Had fun watching them both. Also got a lot done for our open house tomorrow.  I hope the weather holds off-- they are calling for \"scattered thunderstorms\".  We invited everyone who made food for us during my chemo.  Got a huge waterslide for all the kids to play on, too. And yesty night our old fridge in the garage (where we have a lot stored, or put all the stuff for parties!) decided to pretty much die.  The freezer isn't holding the temperature anymore.  Stuff was melting.  Great timing...  we kinda knew it was coming as it's been off and on having issues.  Anyway, had to go out and find another one, plus move the food that really needs to be frozen to the other freezer.  dh did a great job finding a deal at Sears.  The new one is coming Tuesday night.  Not in time for the party, but we are OK anyway.  I decided to make the food tomorrow so it doesn't have to be stored for long, if at all. That's it for me.  I'm pooped.  Started reading a really good book about life after BC treatment (written by an onc social worker who got dx with BC).  So far, so good.  I'll let you know more as I get into it. Oh, almost forgot... The week ahead (June 23-27)! Tuesday: Kris 60 has #10 of 12 weekly T.  On the home stretch!! Saturday: Kimberly's 47th b-day. ",

Carla:  What an emotional roller coaster you are on.  So sorry the DH is at it again.  You just don't need that.  OTOH your Relay sounds like it was great.  I love the butterfly idea-I'm sure you had many things to wish for, too!  And them saying everyone's name and length of survivorship is pretty cool. Keep your chin up.  I wish good things to come your way. Julie:  What awesome pictures!  You look great, girl!  I love the one of you, ds, and dh. Happy to report I am in a much better state after today.  Got in touch with the cleaning company-they start next Wednesday!  Upgraded the fridge and the new one (hopefully the RIGHT one this time) will be here Friday night.  Couldn't manage to get anymore $$$ off (even with the post-chemo hair and the pink bracelet, and the BC hat!).  Oh well!  Still hoping to work things out for dd and dancing this fall.  I haven't given up yet... it'll all work out somehow.  The teacher is on vacation, so I'm waiting to hear from her when she gets back. My tests were a snap today.  Had the DEXA first-you just lay there.  Had the MUGA second.  Went very smoothly, even though my vein acted up and blew, but it was at the end of the second injection and it didn't hurt, just bruised a little.  I think I'll know my results on Friday.  Of course, they tell you nothing while you're there. Hope everyone else is having a good Hump Day.  Back to work tomorrow!",

Loved the pic!  You look great (and that pink shirt is a great color for you BTW).  My hair looks very similar, just much darker (I hate the color as I know I've said before).  I'll have to have some shots taken so I can post them. Carol:  OMG... I can't imagine a house without AC!  I guess our weather here in the NE is much different than the PNW.  We are lucky if we get a month in between turning off the heat and turning on the AC; this year I think it was about 2 weeks in between each.  DE gets its share of 90+ weather, but it's mostly the humidity that withers us in this region.  Once it hits about 78 degrees outside, our upstairs is at least 10 degrees hotter; couldn't live without AC...  Hope you cool off soon, and I hope the walk went well sans cramping. Cathy-CA:  Hope the tea was nice and the car exchange/buying went smoothly.  Oh yes, how it can take hours! LJ:  Congrats on the new DR furniture.  I'm sure it made dp happy, too.  I have my grandparents' 1950s stuff in our DH (and it never gets used either, rather it has junk on it).  I'd like to eventually get newer stuff (more modern) but don't know what I'd do with these relics/antiques as they are now-couldn't just toss them, plus I just don't use the room right now so I can't justify spending the money yet. Julie:  Yucko on the puppy piddle in the bed.  Bet you were glad to have missed that mess. Gotta run.  Not much on the agenda for tomorrow, but the rest of the week is gonna fly by!",

Let's go on over and see what's up with my Jewel friends... Must've missed the last two posts.  I didn't see them when I was composing yesty. Cathy-CA:  Isn't overeating always part of the holidays?  Somehow I know you'll burn it all off with your busy schedule. Congrats (early) on finishing rads this week!  I seem to think/remember that you're doing herceptin like me?  If so, when is your year up?  I'm done in January 2009. SIS Kimberly:  OK, most of your meals sound scrumptious... but buffalo?  Guess I need some more details about that one; I've never had it. OK, just read your latest post, and it sounds OK.  Heck, I've eaten venison and like that better than beef, so buffalo might not be too bad. Tina:  Glad your Harley trips involve some QT \"smelling the roses\".  I think a lot of us have learned to appreciate that.  Makes life so much more meaningful, huh? Carol:  How nice to have moved the palate up a few notches from Cream of Wheat in the past month.  Sounds like you had a delish meal, and a great weekend.  I second Kim's comments about you and Kent.  I doubt you can say anything \"wrong\" to your beloved.  Maybe just telling him how you feel and that you don't know quite why the \"drought\" is occurring.  It'll probably make him feel great just to have you acknowledge what's \"going on\" (or not, in this case), even if it's accompanied by a few tears.  Plus, I know I always feel better just getting it out.  Communicating doesn't have to be pretty or rehearsed, just heart-felt I say! As for rolling in the hay.  Ditto (again) Kim's comment.  You just gotta jump in (so to speak!).  I'm not nearly racking up the bed miles like she is post-Chicago, but at least the ice has been broken.  Of course, now that I've \"given it up\", he just wants it more... but he's a very patient man . Sheshe:  I am still waiting for some chemo curls!  I have probably about an inch of thick hair. Luxurious, as D1 has referred to hers before, is def a good word for its quality.  Maybe I wouldn't hate it so much if it curled.  I venture out without a hat or wig all the time now, except for work where I wear a wig still-mostly just b/c I hate how I look and am vain at work I guess.  I am hoping that after my next salon appointment to ditch the wig altogether-I'm going to get some color to make me blonde again. Loved your pic with your sis!  Cute hat! CHJ:  Lots of us lost the lashes so late, like you.  The good news is they appear to grow back in quickly.  I'd say I had some back within 2-3 weeks after losing them all.  Now I have enough to curl again. Gonna call it a night, gals.  TTFN!",

D1:  That sucks that insurance won't cover your \"garments\"!  Do you have a health savings account?  We do one each year b/c our dental insurance sucks.  We upped the amount for 2008 since we knew there'd be additional medical stuff for me.  It's been very helpful. Carol:  Ditto on being impressed with your walking.  I am so focused on work and the kids I know my exercising has not even been close to par.  I really gotta get going on it. So I had an exciting day.  Went to work and during my 8:30 meeting started to feel strange.  Kinda sweaty, hot, a little nauseous.  I must've looked pretty crappy-- my coworkers said I was pale.  Anyway, this is something I normally (before BC), would've blown off, but since everyone was freaked out I went to employee health who of course added to my then panic.  I ended up at my onc's (since my PCP basically deferred to them--- sigh, the curse of the cancer patient).  Long story short, my labs look awesome (all normal) and they found nothing wrong with me.  My onc was on 'cation, but I saw one of the partners.  Wasn't an infection, wasn't my heart; so he relaxed me a little bit. He sent me home to chill out.  But all the hoo-ha messed with my brain a little and I started to \"go there\" panicking that something was coming back or I was gonna have a heart attack or something.  Geez, the mind is a terrible thing! Off to hang out with dh.  Tomorrow's my long day, and I want to rest up.",

Flu is starting to hit here.  I'm praying that my good handwashing, and the vaccine will cover me.  I'm surrounded by germs between my 2 jobs, dd's schoolmates, and my 2 kids.  I can't let myself get to run down, or I know I'll get something.  And, pink eye is going around ds's preschool class.  He has it of course.  I wear contacts, so I have been a freak about handwashing after I do his drops.  That dx started my week off... Felt bad for dd yesterday; the day was chaotic, not a real fun birthday for her.  We got home and our dog (who's 9) couldn't stand up at all without yelping.  Had us all scared (I thought maybe he'd had another seizure and fell).  The kids were both crying and freaking out.  The dog weighs over 90 lbs.  Dh had to scoop him up and take him to the vet right away.  Dh missed dinner, which upset dd, but made it home in time for cupcakes and singing.  The vet feels it's arthritis and put him on chondroitin powder.  He seemed better last night, but this morning it was the same scenario.  Anyway, it rained all day yesterday, and then the mess with the dog made us late for dd's book fair at school.  By the time we got there everyone was tired and stressed.  It was not a good scene.  I'm hoping tomorrow's party makes up for it.  Plus she's worried about the dog.  And frankly, I don't know what will happen there-- what do you do with a 90 lb. dog who won't walk?  Ugh! I'm hoping to catch up on posts some year!  I've breezed through them real quick.  GTG, work to do!",

So, why I haven't been on in ages...  I ended up in the hospital for 2 days (12/21-22) which totally screwed things up for the holidays. They wanted to keep me longer, but I was so outta there after those 2 days (the unit I was on was awful)!  I was out of work the whole week (sucks, b/c I had so little time accrued), and didn't really feel good until well after Xmas.  Went in and was admitted for what they thought was appendicitis, but turned out to be a very wicked gastroenteritis (didn't have surgery, luckily).  I have NEVER been that sick in my life, and I'll spare you all the gory details.  Chemo was better if that gives you an idea of how evil it was.  Got 5 liters of fluids and about 4 doses of anti-emetics before anything improved.  I was pretty badly dehydrated and was weak for days.  I can see how 3rd world countries have high death rates from this stuff... seriously!  So Xmas was a bust as I had very little ready beforehand except the shopping.  Thank God dh can cook.  I spent what little energy I had wrapping gifts and putting on a happy mommy face for the kids.  My mom and in-laws were here Christmas Day.  The kids were up at 6:30, rarin' to go!  I wasn't back to work until this Monday, and now have some time to make up after being out again yesterday for the MRI, and next week for my port removal surgery.  Life kinda sucked for 2 weeks there.  I'm so tired of all the drama.  Just want to feel normal again (whatever that is, I know it's not what I went through in Dec.).  2009 HAS to be better. I'm just looking ahead hopefully. Joan:  Sorry to read of your mother's passing.  I know my message is late, but my sympathies to you.  I hope having your family round for the holidays helped. Been meaning to ask... is Lucy a Bichon?  I'm considering one as our next dog down the road, or a weiner-dog; but def. something smaller than our 90+ lb. lug (our choc. lab is still around, but getting up there in the years). D1:  Nuts on DD not getting into Vassar.  I know it's cliché, but I truly believe everything does happen for a reason... maybe there's a better fit out there for her. Just read about Lewis and Clark and the other prospects...  Good news! Tina was my last SP (or should I say, I was hers... I sent her stuff).  I got a card from her thanking me for the stuff I sent.  Was happy to hear from her, and glad to read others have also had some contact with her.  Just read her post, too! Hope your days ahead without Megace are brighter. Julie:  Very reassuring to read your post as you are the migraine guru of our bunch.  My eye doc still is leaning towards that dx.  I hope the MRI results are negative so the onc will be assured, too.  I haven't had any more episodes since that one.  But I have had some run-of-the-mill HAs more often than ever. I'm so far behind, I didn't know you got your nips!  Hope they look good and are even.  I hate that my \"highbeams\" are not symmetric, but I'm sure it's \u2018cuz one's real and one's not.  And they took the tissue from WHERE to make yours??  Ouch!  Mine were just pulled up from the tissue on my breast. CHJ:  Thanks for the encouragement.  I am a HA newbie I guess.  I really don't ever get them, let alone this weird visual stuff. Carol:  Thinking of you lots recently (hope you got the warm vibes!).  First off, thanks for letting me borrow the Jewel's Big Girl Panties for my MRI (OK, that sounds really weird, but you catch my drift...).  Secondly, have read about the cold weather you guys have had.  Yuk!  And third, love the seafood cookbook.  Made a fabulous salmon with balsamic vinegar sauce while my dad and step mom were down last weekend; it was delish! Whomever mentioned Vegas as a reunion site... that sounds awesome.  It's on my \"bucket list\" of places to go someday.  But I'd have to bring dh with me as I'd want him to share the Vegas experience with me (but could still do some \"Jewels only\" activities I'm sure).  We both love CSI!  I've been to San Antonio before.  It was OK, but no desire to go again really.  The Alamo was lame (sorry, it was). OMG, just saw the pooch pics in the snow... I just love your doggies! And the snow-girl pic!  Love it, LOL! Carla:  Again, I'm late.  Hope you are feeling better after your spill.  I hope the bruises are gone by now.  Love your SP's gifts to you BTW. Paula:  LOL at your description of the Burger Kind ad.  It is so bizarre.  Got your card yesterday in the mail when I got home from the MRI.  Thanks, it made me smile.  Amazing how a card from a fellow Jewel can make such a difference.  And glad to hear your take on my HAs, too.  I really do hope that's all it is as I'm leaning towards that theory currently. SIS Kimberly:  Just read your post and I second it.  I was completely not in the holiday mood again this year, and really got myself bummed about it all (being rushed, \"unprepared\", just not ready at all).  I just had to stop and remind myself to be thankful for being here and having my family around regardless.  I agree, it has gotten so commercialized!  Hope you and your sis got to spend some quality time together over the break.  And also that all the teachers in the group are getting relaxed and refreshed before returning to their charges on Jan. 5. CathyCA:  One more herceptin to go for you... yea!  It is gonna feel really weird next week when I don't get anymore.  My port's coming out instead on Jan. 9.  Hope you had a nice b-day, too. Therese:  Reading about Julie getting a new car, and you did last year.  Dh and I are due for one by the end of 2009.  We want an Acadia, so I'm hoping we'll find some deals this year.  No one wanted to bite last year as our Sequoia is leased and who wants an SUV lease on their lot? Kris:  Glad the drain's out... what a great Xmas present.  Norma:  Glad to read your episode wasn't a DVT.  No fun visiting docs at the holidays, huh? I know this is sooo long, but I finally had time to write and didn't want to miss anything or anyone.  Happy 2009 and Happy January, Jewels!",

I'll try to keep this short.  It's been a long week already.  No school yesterday for the kids-- thank God it was my day off.  DE is very icy and the road's were a mess.  Needless to say, I could not make it to my eye doc appointment; reschedule date isn't until the End of February.  Like they'll even see anything by then!  I'm waiting to hear what my optometrist suggests about this.  Ds and I are both being treated for strep (that was my sore throat-geez, I'm sick a lot!).  So, my only trek out yesterday was to the pharmacy, and that was enough! Paula:  I just don't even know what to say except your situation just sucks.  I can't even imagine going through that right now.  I hope the chemo helps Ed so that he can talk again.  ((((((hugs))))) Carol (and Norma):  You gals are just too much!  Thanks for the bracelet.  I got it today and will add it to my growing stash of BC jewelry.  I love it. My LV plans are: pool, spa, pool, Cirque du Soleil, more pool, and sleep!  MB still has my vote.  Southwest Airlines will have some package deals for July coming up next month. Deb:  Waaah!  I was hoping you'd hold out longer on the fb thing.  Now it seems like it's just me resisting. Therese:  I think I'll be aiming for an AM flight to LV also. I also haven't been on a plane in ages; I like flying about as much as I like needles.  The last time I was on a plane was my honeymoon in 2000!  Guess I'll be bringing my Xanax along for this trip.  Vettegal: I'm not thrilled about the LV heat you describe.  I really have trouble when it's hot out.  Guess I should plan pool or indoors stuff while I'm there.  BTW, I think I'm rooting for the Steelers now for the SB. OK, that's it for now.  Tomorrow night's my study group again.  My dad and step-mom are coming to watch the kids and will stay overnight.  TTFN, Jewels!",

Maz:  Hope the bx went well and you have some answers soon.  Did ya need the BGP? Kimberly:  I have a small hollow spot on my upper chest too where the implant just does do it for filling in.  Wonder is they could take part of my butt to contour??  Hahaha!  All this menopause talk of the sx makes me not eager to go through it all someday.  Hope the students are better behaved for you this week Patty:  Hope something works out for you to go to LV.  I'm hoping I can get time off, too.  I have to wait until it gets closer before I'll know for sure.  Damn work, getting in the way of play! Paula:  LOL, ROFL about the bipolar Mother Nature!  So true.  I can't wait for spring!  It was enough to make DE messy yesterday, but no school closings in my area (or today for that matter when we got some more snow), and I still had to work both jobs yesterday.  Oh Poo!  And I agree that we shouldn't be posting too much vaca stuff here.  I'd rather get e-mails until I can get onto FB and set some controls there.  LJ:  Where did you get the 3D glasses?  I heard about the commercials but didn't have glasses, so I  watched them (rather dully) in 2D. OK, I caught up.  Made it through the MRI this morning with one Xanax and the Jewels5 CD again.  NO BGP needed-- I must be growing up.  At least this year I had some boobs (albeit FAKE) to hang through the machine for the scan.  Hahaha!  DS is home sick after puking at preschool this morning, so all my plans for the day are pretty much shot.  He's on the sofa, with a big pad around him and a bucket, sipping Gatorade.  I hope I don't catch this illness, too.  I've had enough!  TTFN",

I started chemo this month and currently post on a January chemo group thread that's huge (see under chemo a thread called \"Jan. 2008--  ain't it great???\").  You can check us out, chat with us, whatever; we call ourselves the \"January Jewels\".  I'm sure many will jump on your thread here soon.  It is by far the best support you'll find.  It makes the whole thing so much less scary.  Best of luck with your surgery and chemo.  You can PM me anytime.
