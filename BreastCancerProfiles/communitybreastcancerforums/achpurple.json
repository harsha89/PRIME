These are in early July at our oldest son's wedding - no wig before or after the wedding, but show one while wearing that stupid wig!  It's funny that I was so self conscious about wearing the wig because I think it looks real but I have no problem with that goofy bald head showing.   ",

Have faith and be strong!  All I ever got were kind reactions if any at all.  I never felt like anybody ever felt sorry for me or anything like that.  My hair is almost back to my old length now, but thicker and curly and much darker.  I tried to always hold my head up and not let it take over, mostly trying to be a good example of strength for my kids. ",

Also, in our local paper on Sunday was an article about a medicine called Aromasin for post menapausal women (I don't fall into that category) but wondered if anyone has heard of it.  Says it has fewer side effects than other meds like Arimidex, etc.  The article goes on to say that they figured out that if they radiate the whole arm pit when it's spread to the lymph nodes that it \"significantly lowered the chances that the cancer would come back.\" ",
