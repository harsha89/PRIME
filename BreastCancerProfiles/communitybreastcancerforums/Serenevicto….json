Waiting is definitely so very stressful, I agree, and I too felt like I was going insane from the worry! I frantically searched youtube for something that might help my anxiety and found three things that have helped me more than anything else thus far (along with constant prayer). Those are practicing \"diaphragmatic breathing,\" \"acceptance\" and \"mindfulness.\" I had no control over whether the biopsy results would show cancer. And no amount of worrying or stressing was going to change the biopsy results...or the fact that I have cancer, which the biopsy results showed I do. So, I decided I could either accept it as fact and surrender the outcome to God (or the Universe, or whatever we identify as a Higher Power), or cause myself wave after wave of panic and anxiety by marinating in the \"what ifs.\" I also practice mindfulness, One Moment at a Time, and stay in this present moment, where God is, and where I can relax in my \"safe place,\" which is a place I've created in my mind where I feel peace, serenity, love and light....or I can make myself so anxious that I literally vomit. I also learned diaphragmatic breathing, which sends more oxygen through my body to my brain, and helps me relax so much that sometimes I actually feel a little sleepy afterwards. It's not always easy to practice mindfulness, deep breathing, and acceptance...sometimes I just need to have a good old gully-washing cry, but it is definitely possible! And it may sound corny, but it really does work....and I've found it to be the only way I can stay centered during this difficult time. If you're interested, there are tons of videos on youtube that can help you calm your body, mind and heart while you wait for your results. I wish you all the best and send prayers heaven-ward for you...please come back and tell us your results! Victoria",

My mother had breast cancer at age 65 and had to have a mastectomy. I found a pretty large lump in my right breast (same side as my mother's cancer) two weeks ago, and don't understand how I could have missed it in my daily bathing. Mammogram and ultrasound show two masses, with the second mass being small, but in a lymph node. Not good. The radiologist believes it's probably cancer, and is contacting a surgeon because she says the mass has to come out, even if it's benign. I will be thinking of you Thursday and hope you'll come back to share your results! Prayers for you! Victoria",
