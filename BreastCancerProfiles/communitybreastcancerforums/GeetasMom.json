I know Kimmy is now with my baby girl, and also with Shelli, but my pain is too new to see this happen again. Oh God, when will it end, when will these young girls quit losing their lives to this monster?  When we lost Shelli, Geeta's sorrow was so deep. I know there are friends of Kimmy's out there right now that are feeling the way Geeta did for Shelli. To Kimmy's family, the hurt your going through is unbelievable, something you never think you will have to endure, but hold each other tight! From what I knew of Kimmy, through Geeta of course, is that she was a funny, fun loving person. I know they are having a glass of heavenly wine together right now!",

Kimmy was such a good friend to Geeta, I believe she is the one that sent her the little pillow when she had her surgery, maybe even the little bags to put the drainage tubes in. What a special person she is.  My heart breaks for her, and for all of these ladies. My prayers and hugs go out to Kimmy and her family.",
