She is trying hard not to freak out. So US report shows \"8mm ovoid nodular mass with angulated borders\".. Any thoughts on this? Good?Bad? Ugly? I told her at least they have a specific place to biopsy... When they found my DCIS they were just shooting into an area of calcifications. Anyone here ever hear of this kind of finding and know anything? She's nervous obviously.... She and her mom have been my rock solid supporters during my cancer issues.... I'm now 5 weeks out from my mastectomies and back to work... Feeling pretty well. But I think it lit the fire under her butt to get checked out. My heart hurts for her if it turns out to be cancer... We live states apart. Let me know your thoughts if you have any.
