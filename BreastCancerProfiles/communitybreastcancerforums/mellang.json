You will fill like you are living in \"time blocks\", you wait to see the doc, you wait for more test results, you wait for surgery, your wait for treatment, you wait to see the next doctor..... My head is still spinning with how fast everything happens in such a short time. Share your emotions with your love ones, don't keep it inside, cry in the shower if you need to (that's very therapeutic). Get yourself a planner notebook, so you can keep track of all your appointments. Even if it doesn't fill like it, you will get through this. I wish I would have found this site when I was first diagnosed, there is a lot of good information and a lot of support here! Hang in there. I will keep you in my prayers.",
