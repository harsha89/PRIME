I met with a lady yesterday she is 50, 9 yrs ago she had BC she was stageIIb. She had alot of problems she said she had every S/E there was. She was supposed to have 6 txs but only ended up with 4txs bec. her body couldnt take anymore she ended up having a blood transfusion and was in the hospital for a week. She said chemo was hell for her and 9 yrs later she is doing great!! Good luck today Vivie I'm going in today!!! Kasi hope you had an amazing day yesterday!! I'd like to get in that time machine too!!! Michelle let me know if you find that papaya enzyme havent been able to find it here. Who knows how we got BC!! I keep thinking I got it because I drank way too much diet coke!! I can't remember who said about only getting 1/2 shot of neulasta bc of bone pain, I've been taking claritan before and 2 days after and I havent really had too much bone pain. Have any of you lost your brows and lashes yet?? The Anti Cancer book by David Servan-Schreiber is a great book!! Have any of you cut out dairy?? Wishing all a S/E free day!!! Hugs to all of you",
