All they told me on the phone is I got a zero and I don\u2019t need cemo, I don\u2019t have to see the Dr and they set me up for radiation. I went for the practice one, got the markings and the girl took pictures of my breast. When the other left she said oh the camera broke I\u2019ll be right back and brought her personal cell phone in and took three pictures. Then she said I promise these will not end up on the internet, but I couldn\u2019t find another camera. Today I call there and she said I\u2019m sorry I deleted the pictures and they will take them over on this Monday. Just creeped out about all of this",
