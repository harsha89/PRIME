      "Content": "vered wrote: Hi to all, I had one Taxol treatment after 4 AC, the AC was relatively ok, but Taxol was very difficult. I had triple treatment, and the side effects attacked me very badly. Excruciating pain in the legs and throughout the body Numbness in my fingers and toes, rash, hoarseness and coughing. I consulted with my oncologist and he said that apparently it allergy to Taxol ,and he is not  sure I should continue. Because I've got Estrogen Receptor positive, I'm not sure what to do, since new studies show that Taxol is not effective on my type. I'd love to get your advice Thanks in advance  Log in to post a reply",
