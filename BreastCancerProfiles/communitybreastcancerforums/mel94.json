    "Content": "mel94 wrote: Hi everyone. I'm 23 years old and noticed a lump in my breast in February. I was pregnant at the time. I've been having a lot of health problems for about a year now, but when I was pregnant everything got a lot worse. I started to get extremely weak and theres just too many other things to list. But in November I developed a lump on my foot. My doctors ignored me and didn't think it was a big deal. But once I noticed the breast lump, I knew something wasn't right. I'm pretty sure I have cancer, but I don't think it's breast cancer. I know this is a breast cancer forum, but i'm just curious, would the pathologist be able to tell if it's a metastatic cancer from another site? Or would they only be looking for breast cancer since it was from my breast? i just realized i didn't finish writing the title.. oops. Log in to post a reply",
