I have been \"lurking\" around these boards for 2 weeks now while I waited for my biopsy to be done and then for the results to come back. I kept reminding myself that 80% turn out to be B9 and tried my best to remain positive. Unfortunately, I saw my doc today and got the bad news. All I know so far is that I have invasive ductal carcinoma (6cm tumor in my right breast), and Metastatic Adenocarcinoma involving a portion of lymph node (.7cm in dimension). They will make an appt. for me to see a medical oncologist and a surgical oncologist this week. She (my doc) said that they will most likely be doing chemo first to shrink the tumor and then follow with surgery. I broke into tears as she gave me the news, but I have been calm since then. I don't think it has actually sunk in yet. I feel numb. Anywhoodles....Just wanted to say Aloha to everyone. Hope your Monday was better than mine, lol. \u201cPromise me you'll always remember: You're braver than you believe, and stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think.\u201d \u2015 A.A.

I wish it was scheduled for yesterday, I just want to hurry up and get the ball rolling. I have been learning all I can from this site, and I already have a list of questions prepared for my visit. I hope you all have a great hump day and once again, thank you so much!!",
