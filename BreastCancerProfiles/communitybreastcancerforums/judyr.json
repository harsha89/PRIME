Hang in there, you will find a few standbys that appeal to you........... Judy",

I got a call from my girlfriend whose 16 year old daughter had a mass removed from her breast on Monday. She said the surgeon called here and said the pathology shows a phyllodes tumor that is borderline benign/ intermediate. He wants them to come in first thing in the morning and talk more. Anna is not going to be home till later this eve. and they don't know what to tell her. The whole procedure was very hard. I immediately went to breast cancer .org for info but found nothing on this. So, my questions are what do you tell her and what the heck is this. Is there a better information source that I can pass on to her mom? Thank you all!

It looks like they are going to do a wide excision so that they can get clear margins, not a mastectomy but almost as she is small and the tumor was 4 cm. They did see an oncologist as the tumor was intermediate grade ( it's catagoried benign, intermediate or malignant.)   If anyone has any further information, I would love to hear it and I will pass it on. Thank you! Judy",

The important things are the size (1.9mm is good and small), the grade of the cancer cells ( from 1-3 so 2 is better than 3!) and the mitotic rate is how fast the cells are reproducing (intermediate is not too bad either). There is much more but like peeling an onion you will process the information layer by layer. It really stinks to have to make that choice. It would be easier to just be told this is what you need............Don't hesitate to get a second opinion. Good luck! Judy",
