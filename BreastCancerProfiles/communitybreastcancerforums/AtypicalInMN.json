    "Content": "AtypicalInMN wrote: 48 yrs old with only having having my grandmother with BC at age 81. Extremely dense breasts (D4) ecently was told I have a higher background uptake of estrogen receptor cells based on prior MBI readings and last magnified mammogram indicated changes and possible calfications. Biopsy results came back with atypical hyperplasia and will be meeting with my doctor in two weeks to discuss. Surgery, medicine, or waiting. Concern on taking tamoxifen because I have osteopenia. Most likely still periomenopasual but had an ablation 8 years ago and flashing for last 2-3 years horrmone tests indicate I could be possibly be finished with menopause. My primary dr is concerned for me with going on tamoxifen and having further density reduction in my bone mass. Has anyone has this happen and would you be inclined to have surgery. Personally, I want the whole damn thing out and have an elective mastectomy. Log in to post a reply",
