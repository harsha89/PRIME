I know the waiting for answers and surgery dates sucks, but in the grand scheme of things, it flies by. Being on the other side of surgery and feeling 100% again those are memories that are already fading. You\u2019re on the way to that too! Biggest thing I found helpful was wearing a zip up hoodie inside out and using the pockets to hold my drains. Everything else is just whatever you need to make yourself comfortable. I\u2019ll be having surgery again this month for fat grafting on the 15th so will be joining you on the recovery couch too;)",

Your body and mind will figure out a way to armor yourself while you wait so don\u2019t think too much. It\u2019s also okay to check out a bit and Netflix a series with 76 episodes in 2 weeks ;) Hugs to you, keep us posted",

Same for not great results. You can at least call and just start crying if they know you\u2019re waiting for possible bad news without needing explain much. Having a point person was great. My mom handled all my family knowing, only a few knew right away that I was having lots of appts to figure out medical stuff but once I had a plans/surgery date she went ahead and sent an email with my address if anyone wanted to send a card but that I may not be up to visiting about it. People I saw more often I told. I wasn\u2019t broadcasting it but not keeping a secret either so they didn\u2019t need to feel bad if anyone else brought it up. I did tell some friends via text or email starting with \u201cthis really sucks to tell you this way, saying this out loud is hard to do right now but wanted you to hear from me ....\u201d And for work/lifting restrictions, you can just leave it as a medical issue. I\u2019d hope most people will understand you didn\u2019t offer more info because that\u2019s all you wanted to say. If they are concerned or dense enough to probe, you can judge if the moment is one to share or leave it as \u201cI don\u2019t have enough answer so for myself yet to share",

I\u2019m admittedly still pretty ignorant about clean margins or how much gets taken out for a biopsy, but I thinking if it comes back as cancer going back to surgery likely. I was over having my boob leaking so either way was on board with cleaning that duct out. The scar from that was minimal, and bc of the location of mine eventually wouldn\u2019t be noticeable. Recovery wasn\u2019t bad. Waiting for results sucks (although I had a feeling it would be bad, so I just wanted to move onto the plan for treatment). I don\u2019t know how helpful that is, but hopefully something there was useful. I\u2019m 33.

I didn\u2019t want to possibly do this again for the healthy side later. You\u2019d probably do some surgery on healthy side anyway to get some symmetry. I\u2019ve had 2 fat grafting surgeries since surgery, not that you have to, but it does add more hospital and mild recovery time later. I expected bmx recovery to be worse, it\u2019s obviously not amazing but I wouldn\u2019t want to do that again. ... another surgery note, does the type of reconstruction (if that's what you're doing) you'd have impact your decision? I was able to go straight to implants so it kept everything pretty simple. I'm not as educated about other reconstruction, but there's expanders/swaps that require another go into surgery. Biggest reason was my kids. If they\u2019d been older my decision might have been different, but probably not. They are little (almost 3 and 5 at the time) and need me. They did great with what we went through. I had DCIS and was able to skip out on radiation or chemo, but if something happened later on the other side that was more serious and I needed those things, I just couldn\u2019t rock their world that much. We were also done having kids, which helped make it an easy decision to do both. I\u2019m way happier with my new boobs that I was with the real ones (thanks breastfeeding). I don\u2019t miss my nipples. I don\u2019t have any difference in my sex life. There\u2019s some loss of feeling but not as much as I expected. Sleeping hasn\u2019t been affected too much, I can still sleep on my side and stomach, just a little modified than before. Love not wearing a bra! Like DebAL said, there\u2019s always a chance that this can come back, but I don\u2019t live with that worry until I\u2019m at a 6mo check up appt and I\u2019m in a gown waiting for the doctor and it hits me that while this is just probably an appt to catch up that they could discover something. It\u2019s not even a thought on other days though. It would have been if I\u2019d only done one. I initially had planned on lumpectomy and radiation until my MRI showed a mastectomy would be better for me. From the beginning though I was considering bmx just to be done with this. It does feel weird having something so extreme be the easy choice to make. I struggled with that. It was a relief to me when they came back and said there was more DCIS and a mastectomy would be better. I\u2019ll never know for sure but had I stuck with the pre MRI plan I think I\u2019d have regret not doing more. Big hugs while you think it all out for what\u2019s best for you.",

Here\u2019s how it went down for me. Discharge, mammogram/ultrasound, biopsy, DCIS diagnosis, recommended lumpectomy/radiation, MRI, recommendation change to mastectomy. As soon as I got my diagnosis I had appts made with everyone, even the plastic surgeon hoping that we wouldn\u2019t be needed, and got genetic testing sent off. It\u2019s a little weird to have multiple directions going but also good bc then you\u2019re not waiting for each step to get onto the next one. In my case my MRI was done before genetics came back and I was able to make my decisions from there I\u2019m 33, with a 5 and 3 year old. We are done having kids and I don\u2019t want to deal with this again so I decided on a double mastectomy and was able to go right to reconstruction in the same surgery. Don\u2019t regret it one bit. Hopefully that\u2019s a little helpful for you. The waiting part sucks, but things will get better and your plan will start coming together",
