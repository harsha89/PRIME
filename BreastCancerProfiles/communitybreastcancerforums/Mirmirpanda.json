My Dr. beleives my pregnancy may have been the trigger in my situation. All the extra hormones. I can't really say the rate of growth, I just noticed it one day. I was trying to breast feed and getting very little milk, then I noticed how hard it felt, I noticed some skin puckering when I dried myself off after the shower and my nipple looked funny. I went to the Dr. and here I am. Please try not to stress yourself out. I know that sounds REALLY hard but there is SUCH a high % that you are just fine and trust me, honestly, when push comes to shove you're going to feel better. It's all the waiting, it's agonizing. My fiancé freaked out a lot too. It's normal. It's part of their hunter-gatherer-protecter instincts I think. Try to keep busy, I'm an artist so between my daughter and painting my day is booked haha. Some times I throw fits, but time won't stop, I decided I just gotta throw on my heels, pull up my big girl panties and put on my lipstick and smile. ;) Tuesday is a blink away, we will both have stories to share with each other. Again, I'm truly sorry, I didn't mean to worry you more. Stay positive! I will be keeping you in my thoughts!!!",

I've just recently been reading up on the different types of chemo and what is available to me for my type of cancer. Also reading about hormone therapy like tamoxifen. I think I will ask my oncologist for me to stay on for a 10 year cycle instead of the 5 year due to some recent studies I've been shown. Radiation is the one that scares me. Just remember there are soooooo many factors that play into everyone's diagnosis. Yes there are things against us because we are younger, but there are also things that are for us. Treatment has become so advanced in our time, but you also have to stay positive. Part of fighting and healing is positive attitude and thought. Sometimes when I feel myself drifting off to a place where I don't want to be, I blast my music, I sing, I walk my dogs, I force myself to smile in the mirror or make worst faces at myself till I laugh. Never say never!!!",

It was overwhelming the amount of terms and information that gets thrown at you, everything seems to sit still but fly by at the same time. I had a 4.5 cm mass and an inverted nipple. It was discovered After I was having serious issues trying to breast feed my newborn daughter. They sent me for a mammo, then ultrasound followed by a core biopsy all in a day, it was madness. Then blood tests and ultrasounds the next day. My head was spinning. So many what if's and why me's. Unfortunatley for me, one week later my doctor told me I have a 3.2 cm lump that is IDC. My heart sank into my stomach, I have breast cancer. I just had a baby, I'm recovering from her birth and now I have breast cancer. Wtf?! Now it's been a series of specialists appointments and making the \"plan\". Remember though a lot of the time masses are B9. The waiting was agonizing, it still is. I have an MRI booked tomorrow and then meet an oncologist right after that. I am schedule January 8th for a masectomy with immediate reconstruction. I still don't have all the answers about what I'm up against and it scares me. You have a very, very high chance that this is nothing. Just remember no matter what happens, you are stronger than this. This in no way defines go you are and life does not stop because of it. As you learn more about what's happening to your body you will feel better, surprisingly enough. You feel more in control. I am still scared and I am pissed off!! I hate that we have I go through all of this. As I discovered in myself you will too, you are stronger than this. Keep a notebook, write down questions, have someone with you for appointments and ask for reports. Your ammunition is information. You wanna cry, cry, you wanna scream, scream, you wanna get mad, get mad. It's all ok. There is so much information on this site, so many beautiful women who have fought and are fighting and together we can support eachother and defeat this ugly disease. I'm so sorry you have to go through all of this, I hate that anyone has to go through this and I hope you can find some peace right now. I will be sending you positive thoughts as I know how scary this all is. Remember to breathe and have faith in yourself. Please keep us posted and if you wanna talk let me know. Be strong ❤ ❤ ❤",

I have some white fluff all over my head, and some dark stubblies, but it just looks different. Am I crazy??? Haha. Also has anyone uses Nioxin? And if so which number line? Any vitamins/supplements I should check out? I miss my hair so much I'm willing to try anything!!!",

I just had a beautiful baby girl named Hazel in August, and discovered the tumor late October due to complications breast feeding. I'm 33 and I was hoping it was some sort of clogged infected milk duct. I went to the Dr. and all the sudden it was mammogram, ultrasound and biopsy. I literally pee'd my pants. I was diagnosed with IDC on November 26th, my heart sank, we had just lost my father to pancreatic cancer the spring before. Since being diagnosed it has been nothing but head spinning madness, ultrasounds, blood tests, breast surgeon, plastic surgeon, x-ray, more blood tests, MRI and more ultrasounds. I still don't know as much about my cancer as I would like, no one can really tell me anything different from one test to the next, that I have to wait till after surgery and I'm really scared. I just know that I have breast cancer and I always want to be here for Hazel, so I am fighting for both of us.",

Sometimes it's overwhelming, but I'm my own boss and even a bad day can be better than most people's good days :) Thanks NatsFan. Your post was great. I don't know what's up with her. I know she's stressed out lately with her boyfriend, her roommate, family, school and work. She may have just taken it out on me. Doesn't make it ok. We're goin to have coffee soon and I plan on bringing it up. Thank you Hopex3. I like that you brought your friend to chemo. I didn't even know someone could come with you!!! I think I would love to have her accompany me. I am still afraid of telling people. When my dad told people about his cancer he did lose some friends, even some he knew from school, work mates that have known him for 20+ years. He passed last year, but fought really aggressive pancreatic cancer for just over 3 years! Funny enough, I haven't heard from my mom since I told her about my cancer. She cried when I told her, I'm sure she's having flash backs to my dad being sick. I'm just sad I haven't heard from her much, I use to hear from her every couple days, especially since the birth of my daughter. I'm a bit afraid to ask her about it for fear she'll pull away. She will be here in a few day to spend Christmas with us, I hope she see's that I'm ok and that I'm confident in my surgical/medical team, that I believe in them and myself and that I'm going to kick some serious cancer ass!!!

Feeling a bit better, still stressed, but trying to keep busy. I cleaned the house, did laundry, went shopping, spoiled myself and got things all organized for Chris and Hazel. Thinking of all the ladies who had surgery today. Surgery is tomorrow morning. I have to be at one hospital by 6:30 am for an injection and then get rushed off to another hospital for surgery scheduled for 9:15 am. Just want to get this over with, I just want that pathology report so bad!!! Gonna go to bed soon, 5 am comes really early :) Thank you Ariom!!! Your posts make me feel so much better, even when they're not for me :) Once I meet with my medical oncologist I will direct all my cancer related questions to her and not my family Dr. Also I do have some artists for you to check out in Austrailia, but I can't seem to locate the paper I wrote it on... will get it to you soon though :) Thank you MMSS. I can't understand why my family Dr. wasn't responding and now she's on holidays for a while, oh well. I guess all my stresses and worries came to a head and I panicked. I catch myself looking at my daughter and this all just breaks my heart. It makes my cry because I just always want to be here for her and I'm just so frightened right now. Thank you Nat23. I also feel that any little ache or pain is something major :( I've found that it gets so bad that I have to stay away from anything that I can google from... oh my! kkuziel, Thanks for your post. I will be asking my surgeon for something tomorrow, just to take the edge off. Wirdgirl118, your post helped, thank you. I guess I hit my anxiety breaking point. I've just had such awful back pain and it just terrifies me. I am currently awaiting the results of a bone scan, but I'm hoping it's just stress! I feel like I don't want to bother my family Dr. or that I've asked too many questions already, but then again I feel like I have too because this is my life, my health we're talking about!!!

The way my surgeon explained it made it sound like I have a higher chance of cancer in my nodes :(. I'm hoping it was my groggy drugged up mush brain misinterpreting the all the post surgery info. Just can't wait to get my hands on that pathology report!!! Still awaiting bone scan results as I still have that pesky lower backache. Should have a PET scan soon too. Feeling pretty good today. A little sore, like bruised, but good. Only took 2 T3's for pain this morning. Getting up and around pretty well. They took out my IV and I'll be leaving to go home in just over an hour. Can't wait to see my baby!!! For all those worried about the surgery part, it's a breeze the worrying is the WORST part, all that anxiety!!! I'm the BIGGEST sissy and it honestly wasn't terrible at all!!!",

I can't believe she's almost one! We're also taking her camping for the first time, August is gonna be busy!!! Ariom: glad to hear your follow up went well. Hazel is just a spitfire!!! She is thriving and just amazes me more and more everyday. We are all doing great, just anxious to get this cancer BS behind us and to move on with our lives!!! With LE & tattooing, just go slow.

Been going through all of the new posts and it's just wonderful to read that everyone is doing so well and being so positive!!! Everything has been going so well. No pain, just itchy!!!! Ugh, the bandages are driving me nuts and I'm dreading having them removed! Cleaning the drain isn't as bad as I thought it would be, not much coming out anymore, almost clear. Appetite is normal, in fact I was absolutely starving as soon as I came out of recovery at the hospital and ate a huge meal and a whole lot of fruit :). Range of motion is good, shoulder and neck a bit sore from sleeping propped up on the sofa, really nothing to complain about. Not really taking pain meds, only got tramadol. Getting out, taking walks. The weather has been wonderful for this time of year. Ended up spoiling ourselves and bought a 50\" plasma tv, an Xbox, an iPad mini and some video games. Also picked up a scent diffuser for the house with some calming healing oils, I love it! My friends have been so supportive, making us meals and helping out with the dogs and the baby. Hardest things are not being able to pick up Hazel. It makes me so so sad when she cries for mommy and I can't grab her. Gotta wait for Chris to pick her up and give her to me. I feel like I could pick her up, but was told nothing over 10lbs. I desperately want a shower. Baby wipes just aren't cutting it haha. Also I'm constipated :( it sucks. I've been taking stool softener, eating lots of fruit and fibre and staying hydrated but nothing has worked. Any suggestions? The waiting anxiety hasn't been as bad after surgery as it was before. I got the tumour out, the core of the disease. Now I wait for the pathology report. Praying for clean nodes, clean bone scan and really happy, positive results!!! Trying to stay as optimistic as possible. I just want this all to be over, I want my life back!!! Sigh, I know we all do. Sadly, I have postponed my wedding for a few years. Just can't get excited about it right now. I can't imagine myself walking down the aisle anymore. Thinking about it actually makes me sad. I'm also thinking about freezing some of my eggs. I'm scared that after years of battling cancer and taking tamoxifen, I won't be able to have another baby. We wanted to try for baby number 2 after our wedding this year. I wish adoption wasn't such a long, hard process. We actually have discussed adopting an older child, around Hazel's age, in 5 or so years. Anyone have experience with adoption? Thank you ladies. Thank you all for sharing your fears, your wisdom and your lives, for being so brave and helping navigate this journey. It gives me hope and I know it makes me stronger. I hope you are all doing well and finding peace and comfort.",

I thought i was going to be sick from feeling so overwhelmed. I have a small amount of fluid in there, but she wasn't concerned. Going back next Monday. So now I'm in a bra again and I can shower, thank goodness :). Thinking I'll treat myself to some frozen yogurt to celebrate!",

I am heavier than I'm used too as I gained 50 lbs during pregnancy and still haven't lost my 'mommy tummy' (got 30-35 lbs left to lose) and I now have this numb, disfigured, strange little breast. I stood there staring at myself, strange hair, strange body and I think, will I ever feel whole again? Will I ever feel like myself again? Will I ever love myself like I did before? A poor me day indeed. Through my tears I tried to tell myself that this is about life. This is about saving my life. But I'm mourning my hair, I'm mourning my breast and I'm mourning my care free former life. I tell myself I can't feel like this, I have to take care of my sweet Hazel, I have to keep it together... life won't stop and I'm scared. Give me my pathology results already, port me and pump me full of drugs, I just want my life back please. I barely slept a wink last night, despite just feeling drained. I got a case of the blahs, I know it gets better, but easier said than done. I have so much to be thankful for, I have so much to look forward to and for all of that I am truly grateful. It's a beautiful day out, I'm gonna pack up the baby and take a stroll. Sending out all the positive vibes I have to all, healing thoughts and best wishes. This is a strange journey we are on.",

I got pretty overwhelmed the other day with the body changes, postponing the wedding, holding off on our get away, thinking of not going to shows, not wanting to miss out on anything especially with Hazel... all our little plans, all these 'things'. As I mourned all these 'things', I didn't realize that if I don't go through what I'm going through now those 'things' may never happen. I know I'll lose the baby weight, I know I'll get my hair back, my 'foobs' will heal and get covered in amazing tattoo work and I know when this is all over that life will be better because I fought for it. My wedding will happen and it will be awesome, we will go away next year on our birthdays, the bands will tour again and I will go, but most of all Hazel gets her mom! It's strange to think back just over a year to when I watched my father pass of cancer to be sitting here fresh from surgery from cancer of my own. All the words he said about life and living ringing through my ears. You get one life, make it count. The world doesn't stop because I have cancer. I know I'll have my \"off\" days, but I just got to push through and push past. Now that's all said and done I feel better!!! To catch up on some posts, I too have 'The Phantom Nipple'. It's bizarre! Also it feels different now when I drink really cold liquid, like I can feel it in the 'foob'. Our bodies can do crazy, miraculous things. Daily exercises are going well, haven't started the wall climb one yet, but I have some pretty good flexibility. Still swollen in the side and armpit. A little achey, a little creaky. My chest feels hard, not really sure how implants should feel though. I am afraid to sleep in my bed yet, not even sure when I can. I see my plastic surgeon on Monday, so I'll ask her then, but until then I shall stay propped up on my couch flanked by cats and dogs :) Not on any pain meds or anything, and I've almost gotten rid of this nasty cold! Hopefully I'll get my pathology report on the 28th when I see my breast surgeon, I meet with the medical oncologist on the 30th, then onto chemo land. It's nice to read that others are doing so well after surgery. Super healing thoughts to our sisters having a harder go, please stay positive and I hope you are all resting comfortably. To those awaiting their surgery date, it's over in what feels like a blink of an eye and once you awaken in recovery, you will feel relief. Be strong! Hugs to all!!!",

I wasn't allowed to pick her up for the first week, but had no choice but to during the second week and it was totally fine. I did however hold onto her briefly, well as much as I could, during the first week. I just couldn't stay away haha, that and she says 'mum' and reaches for when she's upset, it broke my heart not to be able to scoop her up. Also, when I'm sleeping I stuff a fluffy/firm pillow under my arm, sorta on my chest and it works nicely. I sleep propped up in my bed now, the couch was driving me nuts and I missed snuggling with Chris. suzilla, I'm with dnadebbs on that one. People can be completely clueless sometimes, but you are right, they don't know you or what you've been through... Hell, what you're going through. You are magnificent. abitmuch, I remember how excited I was when I saw Hazel on screen for the first time, I was so in love!!! You're on one crazy journey, but that lil one will give you such strength. If it wasn't for Hazel, who knows when I may have found out about my tumour.

In reality I am more nervous of what happens after surgery than the surgery itself. Bottom line, I'm scared, terrified in fact. But here's the kicker, I don't think my Dr. likes me. Maybe it's the time of year, or because she's busy or maybe it's just my new mommy/anxiety brain, who knows. She never returns my emails or calls even after she said that's the best way to reach her instead of going all the way down there with a newborn in tow. So I've been feeling awful the last couple weeks, I have terrible lower back pain, on the right side. It feels like it's stabbing through my right side and my lower abdomen/pelvic area is crampy. It's not period cramps, that has come and gone. And in my upper abdomen, I have 'fluttery' throbbing feelings in the stomach and liver, accompanied by nausea. I have also noticed in the last few days I have a strange white discharge (sorry TMI). It doesn't have an odor or anything, but I'm guessing it's a yeast infection. I've only ever had one in my life and it's when I was pregnant and on antibiotics and it appears similar. Can all this be stress? Should I go to a walk in clinic? Had anyone else felt like this? I am so so sooooo terrified of mets! I was told I have no chest wall involvement from the MRI. I was also told that in all the tests done (physical, ultrasound and MRI) my nodes are clean, so far, as I was just reading that doesn't mean anything and only the dissection will tell. No ones said anything about my blood work results. I went for a bone scan yesterday and feel worse today. Also the tumor itself hurts. Like aching, stabbing, throbbing pain and the nipple is so sensitive. Will I piss my Dr. off if I see someone else? Am I just overreacting and casing my body to go haywire from stressing out? Do I need a slap in the face and a quick dunk in a cold river? As you may be able to tell, anxiety is off the charts right now. :(",

      "Content": "Jan 2, 2013 12:04AM - edited Jan 2, 2013 05:46AM by Mirmirpanda Happy New Years Everyone!!! It's been a crazy lil' while. We had SUCH a great 1st family Christmas. Hazel got so spoiled. I hope everyone found some peace this past holiday season and got to relax! So, I have my pre-admission for surgery tomorrow morning and my heart has take up residence in my stomach. It's just all so really real now. Christmas was my one BIG distraction from everything. I had a housefull of people to distract me!!! I have a bone scan on the 3rd and I'm waiting to hear if I'm getting a P.E.T. scan. Surgery is next week!!! I just can't believe it's so soon!!! I also found out what a 'port' is, I had no idea what it involved, kinda freaks me out. Im gonna ask if the surgeon can place it during surgery on the 8th. On a positive note, MRI results were positive! No chest wall attachment, nodes are clean so far. Just gotta hear positive results after surgery! Sadly, I cut my long hair off today. Beautiful reddish purple ombre loose curls. I loved my long hair so much. I had been growing it out for almost 3 years, almost exactly where I wanted it. But in the end, it's just hair!!! I'm having an \"It's just hair\" party after chemo starts, my fiance, Bf and her boyfriend and I are all shaving our heads. We're having cake, haha. My hair is cute now, chin length bob, mega textured and a side shaved. Gonna color it bright copper red tomorrow. I figured if I'm gonna lose it, might as well have some fun. Going wig shopping next week and will get a pixie style cut closer to first chemo session. Also getting a much needed dental cleaning and a crown fitted mid month, January is gonna fly by I just know it. Going cross border shopping on Saturday to keep my brain from working overtime. Gonna get some post surgery goods, stock up on some Kleenex, hand sanitizer and perhaps spoil myself a little :) @ Ariom. I don't really have any particular tattoo sites in mind, but I may be able to recommend some stellar artist based on where you live and what you're thinking at getting. @ Destina. No reasons come to mind. Tattooing is so sophisticated and refined these days, the inks are vegan and the needles barely pass into the skin. I have seen many women post mastectomy with and without reconstruction have work done. It's amazing! @ SherylB. Thank you for sharing your story. It's so true. I have to do what's best for me and take care o myself! I spoke with my friend and was very adamant that absolutely NO negativity will be tolerated. She got the point. I'm planning on having her accompany me to chemo. Thinking of AuntieEm and Tamiami this week. Here's to a positive and kick ass 2013!!! Here is to hope and strength. Here is to all of us!!!",

Coming to terms with chemo, due to my age I've been told I'll receive it despite even the best of test results. Found a wig I really like, it's been hard locating one more my style and age. Got my teeth cleaned, getting my eyes checked and even found some amazing Oliver People's frames I LOVE!!! Getting a little chemo bag ready and some supplies for the house. Getting some meals done up and frozen. Rallying up the troops to help out with the baby if/when I don't feel well, just organizing, going into battle mode~ You have get up EVERY morning & tell yourself, \"I CAN DO THIS!\" (FxC) Good luck tomorrow TammyT!!!

When my surgeon said that the report wasn't available yet I cried, infact I bawled. Actually I've been bawling all day, I can't control it, I just feel so sad right now. It's so dumb, but I just can't explain this feeling. I just want to know exactly what's happening with my body, this is my life. 3 weeks... Ugh! I sure hope my oncologists appointment on Wednesday proves to be more fruitful than today's appointment with the surgeon. Lbwagner69, melindagb and shadytrake: best thoughts with you tomorrow.

I'm exhausted and I haven't even done anything yet. I'm in such disbelief right now, were just talking about being stage IIa and having another baby when I'm 39...now they're discussing possible removal of ovaries and such. I know I should be so thankful I even get to be a mom, but now the possibility of doing it again is so so low and it breaks my heart. I just feel like I was on top of the world. I met a man that changed my world and who just loves me and I love him so much and then there's Hazel, she makes my life crazy but she is just the most wonderful bundle of awesome ever and I never even entertained the idea of having kids! I want to protect them from all of this and I can't. It's been a crazy few months... Congratulations it's a girl and oh, and you have breast cancer. Thank you for all the inspiration, I haven't stopped crying since this time yesterday when I got the news. Got the call to get the PET scan Tuesday @ 9:45...it just has to be clear, it just has to be, this can't be stage IV. It just can't be!!! It really really can't be!!! I see my medical oncologist the following morning.",

This time next year we will all be so strong that the earth shall shake beneath our feet, we shall be more beautiful than we were before this journey and be better women because of it. smethot, I believe I shall be starting chemo early February. I'm going to have a peek at that January 2013 chemo thread. Heard back from my PS, won't be getting my stitches out for 2 more weeks. I'm guessing its because of my water retention in the muscles etc... It was a brief message, don't really feel like playing phone tag today. Looking forward to next Monday, gonna see my BS and hopefully get my pathology report, then off to the medical oncologist on the 30th and then to chemo land I suppose. I went wig shopping the other day, it was pretty weird... I did find a couple that weren't awful, I just can't believe how much they are! Gonna go do mom stuff as I just finally got Hazel down for a nap after an afternoon of singing, dancing, tummy time and lots of mumm mumm crackers ;). This baby refuses to have afternoon naps, it's a good thing she's so cute and sleeps through the night!!!!",

One more blood test and Dr.'s appointment before Christmas and then I get to relax for the rest of the year. Then into 2013 we go, guns blazing.
