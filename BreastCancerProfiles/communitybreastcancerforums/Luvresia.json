The ct was to be of the abdomen and pelvis but for some unknown reason he also did my chest. They found a mass in my left breast and said i needed a biopsy.I was admitted to the hospital for my abscess. A week later I had a mammogram and ultrasound. The mass in my left breast was a cyst, but there is a mass in the right one. It has a starburst shape is 1.6 cm solid deep behind the nipple. Auxillary lymph nodes on both sides enlarged. Have biopsy scheduled for next week. Im freaking out I cant sleep. Trying to stay positive. Log in to post a reply",
