      "Content": "EpicSquirrel wrote: On March 2, about five weeks ago, I underwent a surgical excision for a biopsy (benign result - yay!) The paperwork called it a lumpectomy (though no lymph nodes were removed and she tried not to take much other tissue, though the lump was pretty large) The procedure itself and immediate post-op was pretty easy, not even much bruising or swelling immediately after and I only needed pain meds for one day. One week follow up appointment everything looked good and she told me to come back for follow up in six months. But now, at the about five week mark, I am starting to have more swelling and now significant pain, and have even found new lumps :( I called the doctor's office and she is going to see me in a couple of days, but I'm just wondering if others have had something like this, where the post-op seemed to go very well until several weeks passed? I'm wondering if I should be doing anything different to care for myself. (I've been careful with the area, not doing any heavy lifting, and wearing a sports bra most days. I sleep without a bra and have resumed all of my other normal activities) There isn't really a sign of infection that I can tell (no redness or swelling or discharge), there isn't any problem that I can see at the incision site. But my breast has a fullness on that side, the whole left side of the left breast (the same side where the lump was removed) is just larger and has an uncomfortable full feeling. I have pain if I am not wearing a sports bra or very supportive bra, and I found two new lumps in the same breast. One is right under the nipple, about an inch over from where the other lump was removed. The other is higher in the breast, maybe three inches above the old area. (These are new, weren't there before, though I am prone to breast cysts, which the one under the nipple does feel like to me.) This was a fairly large lump removed and left quite and indention. She removed the entire thing and her nurse practitioner who I was chatting with at one point while the doc was out of the room mentioned that she does usually attempt to kind of bring in some of the surrounding tissue to fill it out - so like a minor reconstruction thing was done? She said at my post op appointment a month ago that it might fill with fluid, that I may have nerve tinges, that there may even feel like a lump under the incision as the tissue fills in and heals and scars up. But what I'm experiencing now seems different or more than what she described :( History of fibrocystic and dense breasts (pain, cysts, aspirations, biopsies). 1.4 cm IDC at age 49 after \"benign\" flare up in early 2017 led to finding IDC. Healthy lifestyle, no genetic mutations. Oncotype 12, chemo not recommended.

In fact I was so determined to do whatever i could to try and prevent them, I gave up caffeine in 2012. No small feat! I just got a call this morning about results from a core needle biopsy of what I originally thought was another cyst flare up (indeed I do have a large simple cyst in the other breast) but these results, the doctor said on the phone that they are stumped, don't know what could cause this, and recommend surgery to remove it and be sure. I thought I would post here in case anyone else has had a similar experience. 48 years old with recent menopause symptoms including two months since last period. Not on any treatment or meds or birth control. Flare up of cystic feeling pain in both breasts over two months, and then in both breasts I found lumps. While waiting for my imaging appointment one breast became red and extremely painful at the lump. Urgent care said infection, and prescribed antibiotics MAmmogram and Ultrasound show simple cyst in one breast. But the other, the red breast, showed a solid mass. Though oval and smooth like a cyst. Aspiration attempted but no fluid came out. Core needle biopsy performed. That's the result I got today that the radiology doc is stumped about - says the lab results are benign but \"discordant\" with the imaging. * cystic cells *reactive inflammatory changes (though no current infection) * infarcted/dead tissue -- not necrotic, she says it's like the blood supply was cut off. But I have had no trauma to the breast that I'm aware of It seems like the infarcted tissue is what's concerning them. She says a cyst shouldn't have this. She recommends surgery to remove the mass, to be 100% sure no cancer. which i will likely do to be sure. But any idea what would cause something like tor what's going on?

      "Content": "EpicSquirrel wrote: I had a great consult with radiation oncologist yesterday. I feel like I would be in good hand with her. This is pre-lumpectomy and pre gene testing so there may be other info that will change my mind about treatment, or change my numbers/odds. But from what we know now (er+/HER2- and I will be on tamoxifen, likely no spread to lymph nodes, non aggressive small cancer) she estimated for me: 15-20% chance of local recurrence if I only do lumpectomy+tamoxifen 5% chance of local recurrence if I do that + rads That's significant. I pressed her for odds of other rad-induced problems: ngiosarcoma, heart/lungs issue, etc.. she downplayed all of those \"new techniques\" and \"extremely low risk\" (even with my left breast cancer). BUT: Lymphedema she said, FROM RADS, even if they are not trying to zap the lymph nodes (if my sentinels are clear) is 3-4% I had to press her for this, I asked specifically about lymphedema. I'm not sure if this is a standard risk, or is based on my anatomy. I am not a candidate for prone positioning because of my small breasts and my the cancer is high up on my chest, she drew a picture showing that SOME nodes would be in the beam even if they aren't aiming for them. This lymphedema risk worries me a lot and is a higher chance than I was expecting to hear. I have limited mobility in my other shoulder already and I like to cook and execise and do photography.. my job involves a lot of typing and other arm activity -- having lymphedema in this arm would be somewhat devastating for my quality of life. She also said if I do rads now I can't do it again, but if I skip rads and get local recurrence, we could do it then. She brought that up, and I wonder if she was trying to give me a reason to opt out? I also asked about the IDEA trial since my cancer fits the profile. She said if I were older or post menopausal she would absolutely be recruiting me for it. Thats a trial for post menopausal 50+ year old women on endocrine therapy with low grade/stage hr+ her2- small tumors who forego rads. I fit the profile EXCEPT I am 49 and perimenopausal I asked if there was anything I could do to qualify, like what if tamoxifen puts me in menopause, what about ovary removal. She almost rolled her eyes and said, without a shred of comedy \"Can you also immediately turn 50\" LOL! I know she can't \"recommend\" I forgo rads, they have to recommend current standard of care. Has anyone else heard from their radiation oncologist about possible incidental lymphedema due to radiation? What were you told? I wonder if it ould it be crazy for me to consider skipping rads due to this History of fibrocystic and dense breasts (pain, cysts, aspirations, biopsies). 1.4 cm IDC at age 49 after \"benign\" flare up in early 2017 led to finding IDC.
