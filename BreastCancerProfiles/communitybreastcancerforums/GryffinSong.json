I also clicked into \"problem solving mode\" and did tons of research so I'd be well prepared for the next step. I found that the more I learned the more I felt in control of the process. That doesn't mean I wasn't terrified, and crying everyday. But at least I felt better able to make decisions when they came up. For instance, with your family history, do you want another lumpectomy, or would you consider mastectomy? These were questions I asked myself and read about. Whatever happens, and whatever decisions you make, major hugs and best wishes!!!",

Unless I'm mistaken, my oncologist said TC was only for very early cancers, and I no longer qualified. I could be mis-remembering, but it's worth asking more questions about the pros and cons of the two protocols, and how your onc might advise you to decide. Hugs and good luck!",

The best thing to do is talk in detail with your surgeon, and the financial support team at your cancer center or hospital. They will know, for your area and situation, what might be possible. Given your repeated scares, I'd think that at prophylactic mastectomy is a very reasonable approach, and hopefully your insurance will see it that way. Hugs and good luck!!!",

I had my first chemo treatment a week ago. So far I'm ok. Some queasy feelings, but no out-and-out nausea. I feel tired. This morning I woke with swollen gums and a mild fever, but not up to the 100.4 threshold where they want to do anything about it. I had a fair amount of pain from the Neulasta shot, mostly in my neck. But feel pretty lucky overall. My treatment regimen is the \"dose-dense\" AC every 2 weeks for 4 treatments, then taxol every two weeks for 4 treatments. The process was fine. I thought I was going to have to do it alone, but a friend showed up in the parking lot and stayed with me. Yay for friends!!! I also had trouble with my first port. It had a kink in the line, and nothing could get through it, so I had to have another surgery to replace it. Surgery was last tuesday, chemo the next day. I have to go to town today to refill a prescription (so I'm at the library on the way). My computer seems to be shot, so unfortunately I can't read/write as much as I'd like. I plan to shave my head this sunday with a friend. My mom and several friends have made hats for me, and although I'm dreading being hairless, I feel so blessed for the folks who are gifting me with hats to cheer me up and keep me warm and protected. I'll make a rather vague offer, because I know I'll have way more hats than I'll need. One friend is sending me NINE hats!!! If anyone here is tight on funds and needs a hat to keep their noggin warm, please PM me. I will gladly pass on a few \"spares\" to those in need. Please use the PM rather than posting a reply, simply because I can't keep up and might miss it. Hugs to all, and I know we can do this!!!",

I'm glad you mentioned the heartburn, because I have that feeling a lot. It's more a feeling of fullness all the way up my chest, which is helping me eat less. I buzzed my hair off yesterday. Met with two friends, buzzed the sides. Then we french braided the center section ( my hair was halfway down my back ) so that I looked like a mongol warrior. Photographed it, and buzzed the rest. To be honest, I rather like it. Sort of fresh and innocent looking. Even though I'm 51 and have a few \"life lines\" (wrinkles) I have really large, round, grayish blue eyes that give me a bit of a pixie look. Fun. We laughed, we hugged, we ate pizza.

I'm even from side to side, and feel relieved not to have regular mammograms and to have so little breast tissue to worry about. Some feel the opposite, and are glad to retain most of their natural tissue. Try to think about what your breasts mean to you. How important are they to your life, your self esteem, and personal relationship you're in. If you have a partner, discuss it and see if it matters to them and how you feel about that. If you don't have a partner, how might you feel in future, meeting someone new. All can factor into your decision.",

I have never once regretted it. I didn't even choose to reconstruct, and feel freer without breasts to worry about. I knew that I'd always be worried about cancer striking again. I still worry, but with all/most of my breast tissue removed I don't worry nearly as much. Do what YOU need to do to feel comfortable, whether it's a lumpectomy or mastectomy. It's your body. Hugs and good luck!!!",

I've looked at my chest every day since surgery, and besides thinking it looks bizarre in its current state of puffy, slightly bruised, taped, stitched bumpiness, it doesn't bother me to look at it at all. I can't imagine, for me, going through further surgery, pain, and recovery just to have them back, especially if they feel as oddly tingly/numb as my chest feels now!!! Hugs to all, no matter their recon decisions!!! :)",

The edges of the skin where the drains come out are irritated, and I'm not sleeping all that well because they easily get ouchy. From everything I've heard, I wouldn't expect to be able to work a full day until 6-8 weeks out.",

My surgeon was very supportive when I said I didn't want reconstruction, and made it very clear that if I changed my mind in future, we could do something then. The overwhelmed feeling is so common, and so devastating. I think giving yourself time to adapt, by taking it one step at a time, makes perfect sense. Hugs and good luck!",

I can walk around, do minor tasks, carry light things, and so on. The drains are a little uncomfortable, and I'm hoping to get one or two of them out tomorrow. I'm off of pain meds for the most part. The overall experience hasn't been too bad. I'm able to look at myself, and at the stuff draining out, but sometimes feel frightened and lost. The surgery itself, emotionally speaking, seems to be the least of my problem. More difficult, for me, is the feeling of my life being out of control, of having failed the last few years of my life, and fears around taking care of myself, especially during a difficult winter without my full strength. I'm very glad I chose not to reconstruct, because the pain is minimal, and I'm not having any of the issues that recon patients seem to have with pain and such. Hugs and good luck!",

I'm two and a half weeks out and two of my drains are STILL outputting too much fluid!!! The one I've had removed was SO relieving. Everyone is right when they say you'll feel tons better with them removed. As for reconstruction, the only bad moment I've had was last night. I'm still staying with a friend right now, because it's been snowing so much that I'd have trouble dealing with it on my own. There were three teenagers here last night, and they were telling a joke about bra sizes. After they left the room I felt myself all weepy, thinking, but I have no bra size. First time I've felt sad at all about losing my breasts, and it isn't bothering me this morning at all. My fears about lymphedema are still much more immediate than loss of my breasts, since I had all my nodes removed on the right side.",
