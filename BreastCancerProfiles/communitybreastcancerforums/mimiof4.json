My once very thick hair has thinned a lot.  First I took Arimidex and now the generic Anastrozole.   I have tried women's Rogaine where my hairline recedes on either sides in front. (I wear bangs so it isn't quite as bad as it sounds).  I have also used the Biotin products.  I have had little success with either product. My hair stylist suggested men's Rogaine, and I wondered if anyone knows if it is safe to use since the instructions say it is not for women. I researched a couple of products that can be applied to thin places in your hair.  They don't solve the problem but do make the thin places less obvious.  One product is Toppik which is a dry product that you sprinkle onto the thin places, such as a part, to hide your scalp.  You can buy it online.  Another product is Rita Hazan Root Concealer which you spray onto the thin places. I buy this product at Sephora.  In both cases you match your hair color to a number of color options. Thank you for letting me discuss my hair problems.  I thank God for every day he has given me, and I don't talk about this small problem to others.  It is so menial in comparison to what many of you are going through. My prayers are with each one of you.",

Also, how long will it be after chemo that I start feeling more like myself?  I am 65 years old, but I have always been a high energy person and able to accomplish a lot.  These last few round of chemo have found me with almost no good days,  I realize everyone is different.
