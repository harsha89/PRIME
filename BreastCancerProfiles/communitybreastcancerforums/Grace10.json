I will say that they also injected epinephrine to help control bleeding and I had an unexpected reaction to that.  It made me very jittery and I almost passed out but they turned me over on my side and I was fine.  The nurse said if I ever had to do another biopsy to eat a good breakfast to help lessen the side effects of the epinephrine. I walked out 10mins later and felt fine.  Second day I was a little sore but today I feel great!  Getting results on Tueday.",

      "Content": "Grace10 wrote: Hello everyone, I'm nervously preparing for a mammotome tomorrow.  About three months ago I felt a lump in my right breast in the 12o'clock position.  Since I'm only 34 I decided to keep an eye on it and follow up with my GYN at my annual exam that was already scheduled in 6 weeks. I also have the Mirena IUD and don't have periods so I couldn't really tell if it had something to do with hormonal changes during the month.  During the 6 weeks it didn't go away or shrink and when the GYN felt it at my annual she said we should get this checked out.  I got a mammogram and ultrasound a few days later and the results were hard to read because of my dense breasts.  After a consult with a breast surgeon it was decided to do an MRI because they didn't want to scar my breast tissue for future BC detection if they didn't have to and I have no family history.  The MRI came back as Birads 4 and the lump was classified as a 2.2 cm heterogeneously enhancing mass and suggested that it be biopsied. So, tomorrow is the day of my biopsy and i'm very anxious to find out what this thing is.  I wish I knew if BC on MRI is heterogenously enhancing or could it also be B9?  And why was the ultrasound and mammogram Birads 3? Is that a good sign? Which test are more accurate for someone my age?  I guess I just have to wait, probably until next week for the results.  This test and wait cycle of tests is so nerve racking!!
