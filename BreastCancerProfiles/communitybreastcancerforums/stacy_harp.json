I had that Tuesday and while waiting the tech said Dr requested I have an ultrasound so I did and the Dr even came in and did a second one himself. He scanned the pea sized finding and said it didnt show that it was fluid filled but is so small that he requests waiting 6 months to recheck (report said \"hypoechoic ovoid 4x7x3mm and echogenic or vascular properties were not demonstrated BIRAD 3 on mammo and BIRAD 4 on U/S). I found this answer HORRENDOUS so I called my PCM because One of my family friends from childhood just passed away one week ago from BC (she only fought 9 months)that it scares me to death to wait!!! I asked him if I was blowing this out of proportion? He didnt think so and called in a referral to a surgeon. I have an appointment on Monday but found out today it is with the same general surgeon that did my teenagers appendectomy last summer?!?!?! i am spinning because I was thinking it would be someone who specialized in breast issues. Do I go to this appointment and tell him I want an MRI and a referral to a breast specialist? Any help is appreciated and thanks for giving me the courage to finally get a login and stop \"creepin\" LOL",
