This article cites studies of different products and their effectiveness: http://ons.metapress.com/content/b076877857126648/fulltext.pdf I used aquafor at night to keep it moist but washed it off in morning.  MX generally suffer more than LX it seems. My RO wanted an \"angry burn\" and it took until about day 23 to get there including the bolus. I was pretty annoyed and fought her on the bolus (they don't use it in Europe as much but RO wanted it because she said it helps keep burn at top of skin where cancer cells hang out). She finally took away the bolus for the last two sessions once she got the burn she wanted. It was really ugly the week after but eventually healed and now you can't tell the difference by look- sometimes part feels a little tingly even still. ",

I cannot say for sure your hip pain is unrelated, though most likely it is unrelated. If it helps, once I was diagnosed I developed a cough that lasted through my CT scan showing the BC had not spread to my lungs- it then went away! The most you can do is talk to your oncologist about your concerns. If you are not confident in your institution, get a second opinion at an NCI institution which is a good idea anyway. You may decide to do body scans (PET, CT) before treatment. Scans are scary but can bring your peace of mind or useful information for going forward. I did a CT scan before my MX which showed no evidence of spread to my body. When the MX surgery pathology indicated unexpected micromets in 3 lymph nodes, I already knew it had not spread further. So I was sad but not as scared as I would have been if I had waited to do the scan till after surgery. I urged my MO to order it even though US and MRI had shown no spread to nodes. You do have to self-advocate. These boards are amazing- ask any questions! BTW, I'm just about 3 years out and doing great. Hugs!",

MY RO was definite about radiation. Because I had ALND after Sentinel node biopsy in which they found NOTHING more, I opted to not do direct radiation of my armpit to reduce chance of LE though it did get the edges of the armpit anyway. No LE. I did 25 days of radiation to a couple spots on the breast and supra clavicle as well. I used mostly calendula cream which I think took good care of my skin. Towards the end it did get an angry burn (my RO wanted that), but it did heal over the following weeks and month. I have not found I have suffered any bad side effects. My heart is fine. My skin looks how it did before- can't tell difference between radiated and non radiated as far as skin color/texture. It no longer \"tingles\" as it used to. I am having my exchange next month, we shall see if there are any issues in healing because of radiated skin. I've been so long out, I'm hoping not. Good luck with your decision!",

At the time of my DX (sept, 2012) the MO, Hal Burstein, whom I consulted at Dana Farber said that there had been no difference in outcome between chemo before and after surgery-- he said they had hoped they would learn something or had different outcomes from chemo first but hadn't. Not sure if he was talking about all BC or just her2+. Right now Perjeta is only approved for pre-surgery so there was no other choice for you anyway. BTW, recent studies said that the Perjeta- Herceptin combo was especially effective with ER-, Pr-, HER2+, so seems like you're going to do great!",

I recently had a breast ultrasound recently that picked up a \"Cyst\" -- but when they tried to aspirate it, it didn't collapse. So right then and there they did a core biopsy. I freaked out. But it turned out blessedly to be a fibroadenoma. By the way, I now have a uterine U/S coming up because my PCP felt something and am hoping (and she thinks) it will be a fibroid. Sometimes I just want to decline imaging because of false positives. But I know early detection is important.. The whole process is exhausting - my fingers are crossed for you.",
