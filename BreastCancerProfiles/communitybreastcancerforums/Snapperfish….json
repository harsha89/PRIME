All the info the drs give you is so confusing so I\u2019m glad we have some idea of what will happen. Can I ask your opinion please? Last year my mums maternal cousin also had breast cancer. Shes51, pre menopausal. She was found to have a 3.5cm tumour, er positive (not sure how strongly), pr neg, her2 neg, micromets - I think that\u2019s what they called them - in about 2/3 of her lymph nodes. She was put on tamoxifen, had shots to stop her ovaries working, lumpectomy and reduction and then radiotherapy. She too was grade 3, stage 2a. Do you think she should have had chemo? No oncotype scoring was carried out. Sorry for so much info and manyquestions.",

Was advised that her lymph nodes appeared clear on all the ultrasounds so her treatment would most likely be lumpectomy with breast reduction followed by radiotherapy. 20th Aug she had the surgery. Clear margins. However we\u2019ve now been told she has 2/4 lymph nodes cancerous, the original tumour has changed in that it now contains cells that are only 3/8 er positive, pr neg and her2 neg. The lump removed was actually 5.5cm plus margins or whatever extra tissue they removed and def a grade 3. This now means she has to have chemo. Her first oncology appt is 14th Sep. Does anyone else here have experience of this same cancer? Mum wanted me to do some research for her so I thought I\u2019d start here as you all seem so knowledgeable. Thank you all in advance Log in to post a reply",

I did think her treatment might have to be aggressive with everything I\u2019ve terrified myself with on google ðŸ˜¨.  She was put on letrozole to try and shrink the tumour because of where it was in her breast. It was in a 6 o\u2019clock position, quite far back. She is large breasted so he said the op would be more straight forward and less chance of disfigurement if he could shrink it first. Unfortunately because the cells changed the letrozole had little effect on it",
