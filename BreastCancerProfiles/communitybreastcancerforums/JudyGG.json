The main thing I have found is that when I'm OK, I'm still NOT ok and battling anxiety and fatigue (both hard to quantify when I'm used to \"getting over it and on with it\"). The newest wrinkle for me was when I asked my oncologist what my re-occurrence rate is with and without arimidex and she told me she didn't know because my bi-lateral diagnosis put me in too small a group! Expect things to keep coming at you, deal with what you can, find a support system- Sorry you are starting this path but hope our thoughts help give you strength",
