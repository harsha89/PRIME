Is there any chance that another sub can step in when the current one is done? Any possibility of short term disability until you have healed a bit more? Getting up at 5:30 would certainly take some reconditioning. I am assuming that it would be for the month of June only that you would need to do so. (I'm assuming school is done at the end of June) But that could make for a very long month for you. If you were to quit your job, is there any volunteer opportunities nearby that could help fill your days? Maybe at a seniors home, the library, the school etc.",

      "Content": "May 19, 2013 05:55AM - edited May 19, 2013 05:58AM by barsco1963 suecolo2 - nausea is sometimes difficult to deal with. I have been dealing with it for well over a year now. I have tried a few anit-nausea meds. Some didn't work for me and some did for a while only to give way once more to the nausea. I too have lost a lot of weight but am now trying another med that is doing ok. Not a complete reprieve but it does help. It might be worth it to talk it over with your dr to see if there is another med which you could try. I also drink a lot of ginger tea and that seems to settle things quite a bit. I just peel and cut up a small bit of ginger root and add it to boiling water.  I sure hope you find something to help you out. (edited) Just a note to say that I am still on tamoxifen which is what I believe is causing my nausea. However, not willing to give up the tamo as it is doing wonders at keeping me stable.",

I was pretty sure from the beginning that it was the tamo that was causing nausea. However, onc would not agree with me until lately after testing for everything else under the sun. I tried various anti nausea drugs to no avail. I am now on an anti depressant along with an anti nausea which seem to be helping. The nausea is not as prominent as it was. Still having some digestive issues but things are much better. I didn't think that it was a psychological issue but, am now wondering about that. I was at one point afraid to eat anything with sugar, or dairy or soy and wasn't sure what I could eat....so I ate little. Once I realized that I needed to get nutrition of some sort into me, I found that smoothies went down easily - just mixed a bit of greek yogurt for protein, some milk, and fruit/fruit juice. Also soups, oatmeal & ice cream/frozen yogurt, rice, pasta. Nutritionist advised to stay away from the Ensure and Boost shakes due to the soy content. There is a Boost fruit drink that she suggested. Take it one day at a time and try not to think about your weight, but rather about eating healthy so that your body has the energy to deal with whatever comes along. Good luck - let us know how you are making out.",

Some people just never \"get it\". One coworker insisted on telling me that I \"looked to good to have cancer\" on more than one occasion. I finallly told her that the ugly was \"all on the inside\". She has asked more than once how long tx will be. And the topper? At a friend's b-day party the conversation came around to bc and after some discussion, she said \"You're not going to die.\" I should have asked her to put that in writing but I didn't want to ruin the party mood so I just smiled and moved on. Cancer does not give anyone reason to be happy, grateful, or blessed. It is not a gift. But we do have to remember that we are more than just a \"cancer patient\" There are other things in our lives that we can be thankful for. And that is what I try to concentrate on.

Now I tell people that I am more than happy to be getting older! It's better than the alternative right? I can't believe the soy story. Sometimes public servers just need to accept that when you ask for something, it is up to them to provide it without prodding or pushing. Sometimes it takes a straight up, in their face response such as \"I am positive - positive that I have stage IV cancer and it will kill me eventually.\" to make them stop and listen. Perhaps instead of the fuzzy pink mascot costume, you could make up a \"Positively Pink Poker\" for negative reinforcement. Every time someone gives you advice or tells you that you need to \"just be more positive\", you could give em a big old poke in the ribs (or elsewhere). Maybe that would get the message across? lol I hope that this coming week will provide you with some relief from the pain and fatigue that you are experiencing.",

I am 49 years old and was dx stage IV (liver mets) from the start. I was so naive in the beginning but have learned a great deal from everyone here. I am married (21 yrs now) to a man who loves me with all of his heart, and we have a 19 yr old son who is our pride and joy. I have a great support network in my family. With 5 sisters and 2 brothers, there isn't often a day that goes by without some sort of communication. The mets have mostly been taken care of with tamoxifen and zoladex. Had 8 to start with and now only measuring 2 on the scans. They have been stable for 6 mos or so now. I look forward to getting to know more and more of you and hanging out for many years to come.

Be your own advocate and don't be afraid to ask questions. I don't think anyone can tell you life expectancy. I do know that there are women with metstatic bc that have lived for 15 yrs or more. My treatment is different than I had expected (chemo, then radiation). I am taking Tamoxifen daily and a monthly injection of Zoladex. Every diagnosis and treatment are very personalized.

You are still young and there are plenty of tx out there which you can still have a good quality of life for a very long time to come. Hang in there! We are all here for each other.",

You are sure to find others in a similar situation and lots of information and support there. As I have said before - we are here for one another through the good, the bad and the ugly.

It could be nerves regenerating ( I still get pain 2.5 yrs out from mx), SEs from tamox or any number of things. Hoping that it is nothing of great concern. Forgot to mention that your gp might be a great resource also. He/She can order tests, scans etc. I often see my gp for symptoms as she is closer to me, and we have a great relationship.",

Regardless, I can't imagine anyone being asked to not attend any events or even become banned from the property because of any odor that may be deemed offensive by a couple of people. As mentioned could it be any worse than some of the colognes or perfumes that some people insist on wearing even though so many places are now scent free. Has anyone ever asked a farmer not to come within \"smelling\" distance after they've put in a long hard day in the barn. How about those who eat a lot of garlic, or curry or other foods that permeate the skin? The list could go on. I feel for the girls who will now likely be the brunt of bullying and jokes from their peers. Kids can be cruel. Perhaps there is more to the story that we haven't heard.",

You are sensible in your thinking that you cannot use all of your finances to be with your mom when you, as a mom yourself, need to be there for your children. I am sure your parents understand that you cannot be there 24/7 and I am sure that they do not expect you to be. You say you are in touch on a daily basis, and that is more than some can hope for.

Chrissy's idea of smoothies are a great idea, you can add protein powder, spinach, kale, etc. There are also meal supplement/replacements available here, but not sure if you have them where you are. Boost, Ensure, and Glucerna are some of the ones I know of. The boost comes in a smoothie type as well as a juice type. I have also been dealing with nausea for a long while and although not much fun - forcing ones self to eat is sometime necessary (as long as it doesn't cause vomiting). Other options might be - soda crackers, dry cheerios, rice, mashed potatoes, or anything bland tasting. It is sometimes the smell of food that causes one to become nauseated and not want to eat. Try to encourage her to continue eating and drinking throughout the day.

I was concerned about not getting chemo - I thought everyone had to do chemo. But after discussing with my onc, he stated that we were going to start with hormonals and keep the big guns (chemo) for later on down the road. The hormonals are working very well for me - tumors continue to shrink since last year. Speak with your onc for a clearer understanding.

Not everyone wants to know the \"what ifs\" or all of the possible SEs of their tx. I encourage you to make sure that your SIL would not be put out if you were to research her tx. However, you can still be a great support for your SIL without knowing all about the tx that she is on. Encourage her to rest if you see that she is pushing too hard, if you think a SE warrants a call to the onc then help her to make the call.

I figured that since the social club gives a gift for babies, weddings etc and I give to the social club each month, then that is my contribution. I don't mind donating to a personal cause such as one of the part timers having an unexpected medical leave for an extended time.

It was not you that didn't handle the chemo well, it was the chemo that was very rough on you and your body. It is hard not to think of mets every time there is an ache or pain. Often the meds we are given have SEs which cause a lot of aches/pains. I have been told that if the symptom/pain lasts for two weeks or more then it should be checked out. I have just gone through a yr where I was sure that everything was a symptom of progression or new mets. Definitely worrisome. But after all of the scans and testing and now with the help of Ciprilex, I am feeling a bit more relaxed about things. It all takes time and perhaps some anti anxiety drugs to help us enjoy more of the good and push the fears to the back burner. I hope that you are able to get to a place where you are feeling better both physically and emotionally. ((hugs))",

While looking through some reading material that was sent home from hospital with me - I found bc.org and checked it out. About a week after umx a CT scan showed spots on my liver. I was devastated. But a US guided biopsy noted that it was not cancer. Hooray!! But - wait a minute - the doctor also noted that he could not be sure he got a good sample as the US was not very clear and it was hard to see. So a second CT guided biopsy was ordered and confirmed mets. :( On one hand I was glad that I would not have to do chemo & rads (not now at least), but on the other hand...........mets. I am still at odds with how to deal with it - most days are good. I have an \"it is what it is\" attitude. The tx is working very well  (tamo & zoladex) as tumors continue to shrink. So I concentrate on that and try to appreciate each day that I am given. I have a wonderful support network of family and friends, which I am truly thankful for. There is so much inspiration and support here. I don't post a lot, but do read a lot of threads and try to post words of encouragement and support when I can. I look forward to being here for a long, long time. Barb",

It seems that there is so much that can go on within the breast. Your pain could be a number of things. I encourage you to keep on your Drs until you have peace of mind. There is an older thread on this site called \"Can Fibroadenoma be really painful?\" I actually googled \"fibroadenoma pain\" which lead me to the thread - was first post that came up on google. You may find some helpful info there. I believe that some women had the fibroadenoma removed. I do hope that you can get some resolution to all of this pain. Best of luck - keep us posted. Barb",

Take one day at a time - as Chrissy mentioned, that little pill packs a potent punch. Hormonals were my first treatment and are still working well for me almost 2.5 yrs later. Come by often to let us know how you are doing and to ask any questions that my come to mind. We are all here for you.",
