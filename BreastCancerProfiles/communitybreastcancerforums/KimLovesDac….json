Jenn is survived her 3 year old son Connor Dale and her loving husband Cameron; parents Jim and Janice Drury; brother Andrew (Jolyne); in-laws Cindy and Kevin Climenhaga; sister-in-law April (Trendon); brother-in-law Alex (Katey); Cam's grandmas Barbara Climenhaga and Lillian Parker. She is also survived by many aunts, uncles, and cousins. She is predeceased by her grandparents Gladys and Vern Drury, and Margaret and Russell Girvan; uncles Jack Drury and Earl Silverthorn; and cousin Laurie Davison. Jenn grew up in the Swanson district and attended Delisle Elementary and Composite High School, graduating in 1999. Interests in these years were Brownies, 4-H, drama, friends, and her passion - reading. She obtained her diploma in Library and Information Technology from SIAST in Saskatoon in 2002, and her education degree convocating in 2006. In 2005 Jenn married her high school sweetheart Cameron. They lived in Saskatoon until 2009 when Jenn's position as teacher librarian found them and 1 year old Connor moving to North Battleford. Jennifer was passionate in her love of literacy and found her chosen career very fulfilling. She also was involved with NBCHS drama and Collective Voice Theater, and was looking forward to an upcoming term as president of the Sask. School Library Association. Most of all Jenn loved to spend time with her two men Cam and Connor, whether it was fishing at the lake, Sunday morning breakfasts, time with extended family, or their many circles of friends. In May of 2010, Jenn was diagnosed with breast cancer. With great courage and determination she endured 15 months of treatments. The support of the medical community, co-workers, many friends and family will always be remembered. Celebration of Jennifer's life will be held at 2:00 pm on Wednesday, July 27 at the North Battleford Comprehensive High School Gymnasium (1791-110th Street, North Battleford). Memorial donations can be made to the Connor Dale Climenhaga Education Trust Fund, at any RBC branch. Funeral Arrangements have been entrusted to Kristeen Nylander of Sallows & McDonald - Wilson & Zehner Funeral Home, North Battleford, SK. 445-2418",

      "Content": "Jan 25, 2012 02:09AM - edited Jan 25, 2012 02:12AM by KimLovesDachshunds Summer:  I am going to step out and speak up (because I always do when I should probably not) -- but prayerfully I will say the right thing here.  PRAYERFULLY!  It is WRONG on SO many levels for this lady (who is having problems with her husband) to be leaning on anyone short of a REAL therapist.  I can understand how it can sorta happen since the husbands are friends and thus, she thought she could perhaps get an \"inside\" handle on fixing the problem through this \"leaning\" but enough is enough.  This being said -- here is what I suggest.  (To give you some insight on how this hits me -- I had jealous issues BIG time when I was married to my present husband due to a cheating first husband the pain of my stressing over it happening again and the \"acting out\" I did was so hard on my stomach and my nerves.  But that story is another day!)  :)  My PAST experience on trying to get my husband to see my \"fears\" and so forth ended up with him batting it back to me on my being \"insecure\" and \"unreasonable.\"  At the time that HURT me and seemed to SCREAM that I DID indeed have something to worry about -- which only fed my fears and thus, the vicious cycle in which I acted insecure and in which he would withdraw. I get the image of \"there was I time I felt attractive\" but no longer have any level of that feeling.  I get that because I feel the same way.  What I want to get to you through this e-mail is no routine -- oh you survived cancer -- you fought a great fight and you are more beautiful than ever.  Because YOU KNOW this already and still the pains of what you are expressing are real AND saying the \"TYPICAL\" lines will not ease your burden.  The fact might be that this lady couldn't even come close to fighting such a battle -- having such inner strength and beauty doesn't lift the \"fear\" either -- even though it might be a BIG TIME truth! So -- IF possible -- go get your hair styled a little differently / get your nails done -- go to a spa -- get PAMPERED.  If possible go visit a counselor -- don't take offense -- this is offered in love because they KNOW how to boost us and help defuse our fears and help us NOT READ into things which our fearful / depressed states of mind can so easily do.  Do not wear a dress to look \"sexier\" than her -- wear a dress (or outfit -- doesn't have to be a dress) that showcases your ELEGANCE!  Your sense of humanity -- your deep level of love of others -- you compassionate spirit to other women.  Walk with dignity -- handle yourself with inner pride of who you are and where you are going!  (I am envisioning my own mother who has had depression issues all of her life and she came from a very poor family and in a small town had rich women looking down on her -- but she could walk into a room and even if she wasn't aware of it, her sense of dignity / her sense of compassionate spirit was the BEAUTY that they all would love to have even had a pinch of having!!  She really was (is) ALL THAT!  -- and SO ARE YOU!!) I will keep your husband in my prayers that he stop being so \"male\" in this \"rescuing\" mode that has inadvertently fallen into his lap.  Sometimes things can get \"dicey\" faster than we human realize and we will later joke and say it was just in fun when really we were treading on a icey slope!  (Our gut instincts KNOW it but we talk ourselves into not knowing it!)  Please do what you KNOW you can do to regain a level of sureness of yourself in this.  Believe in yourself -- gain a level of confidence here and you will draw in confidence and respect back.  Does this make sense!??!  Don't let stupid fb or dumb joking on their part unsettle you.  I will pray it passes quickly.  I know what I am suggesting is EASIER said than done.  I TRULY TRULY do -- but you can do this -- you can regain that stronghold in yourself.  Please don't let yourself be robbed of this security in knowing you are a VERY SPECIAL / VERY LOVED / VERY BEAUTIFUL person!  (I am 55 -- so I know that I am limited in my ability to be able to understand the walk bc caused those of you so young! )  But my heart goes out to you and my prayers are with you on this situation.  I was always so tiny -- so peppy -- never had a weight issue -- never had an image issue to any degree that kept me down.  Now, I pretty much see a FAT lady looking at me so I  try not to look.  I see my hair looking good some days and then some days -- it just looks a bit funky and unreal.  I kept it blonde and now it is a dark brown and the person I see -- I am unsure of who she is at times!  I remind myself of the walk 2 years ago and the image that I am ALIVE and I try to refocus on that and not the me before.  But I know this is hard for younger people.  I truly do.  I will also pray that she gets very sick with a flu bug and doesn't come.  LOL  Blessings to you -- positive prayers -- much love -- may the weekend turn out to be beyond your wildest dreams on the end of hubby being more attentive and more tuned in.  They have funks like we have funks --  praying it will be a UNFUNKED weekend for the two of you!  LOVE YOU GIRL!  WARRIORS --- don't let the enemies of this world hold you down!",

HUGS to everyone.  If anyone likes this kind of thing -- I found on halfbooks.com a book called -- Chicken Soup for the Breast Cancer Survivor's Soul-- short uplifting stories -- so far -- enjoyed reading here and there.  Story about a mom telling her young son who loves superheros that Chemo was like a special superhero that fought the cancer so well he KNOCKED the hair off her head.  It helped the very young son understand and not fear her cancer.  Just thought I'd share that with anyone who might be interested!  Much love to you all!  Kim",

Sincerely Patricia Delainey Account Manager North Battleford Branch  I just finished speaking with Dawn and she suggested that due to the restrictions between countries and the fact that the trust fund is only going to be open for a limited time, she felt it wiser to send a money order directly to Cameron.  She said personal checks will be held up and the processing of things can even take up to 25 days.  In this regard, then it sounds like it is wiser to get a money order payable to Cameron Climenhaga and let him process the funds accordingly.  Feel free though to call Dawn at the above-referenced number if you need more information.  The address again for Cameron Climenhaga is 2092 95th St. North Battleford, Saskatchewan, Canada S9A 3C7. ",

      "Content": "Aug 6, 2010 09:35PM - edited Aug 6, 2010 09:42PM by KimLovesDachshunds Hi!  I wanted to share a wig idea.  I have gotten three wigs -- different styles -- to wear when I return to work (law firm) in about 2 weeks.  The stylist / shops sell \"stocking / hose type\" coverings for your head before you put the wig on.  Well, with my HOT FLASHES and sweating head, those make it only worse but I know you need to try to keep the wig clean somehow.  SOO, I thought cotton -- small underwear could be revamped.  I purchased Hanes Cotton Stretch Size 7.  I folded each leg opening towards the center and sewed individually each leg shut.  So it has only the opening that fits the \"hip\".  I put the \"butt\" part in front and fitted it to my head and then folded the \"sealed legs\" in and pinned.  Then I gathered the excess in the \"back\" together and pinned.  Then I sewed where I pinned the \"sealed legs\".  Then I cut off the excess in the back that had been pinned and sewed the remaining part together that incorporates the elastic of what had been the \"hip/waist\".  This now has made a covering for my NEKID head that can fit a wig over it as well as help absorb any sweat and keep the wig from scratching my headbone.  I hope this makes sense.  It sounds wacky but I think it will work.  I purchased \"nude\" colored panties.  I purchased a cheaper wig but one that is red that my Husband likes -- it has \"combs\" in the front and in the back.  These can slip into the \"underwear hat\" and help stabilize the wig better too.  Hope this is useful for someone who can make sense of my stuff here.  Much love to each of you!  Kim",

TAXOTERE will make your food taste like metallic / non tasting.  It will make your tongue / mouth ./ teeth feel as if there is no real feeling -- for weeks even after you finish it up.  (My last treatment was 7/29 and I still have some lingering non-taste /feeling mouth issues.   Use a gentle toothbrush -- I got a child's toothbrush because they are soft bristles. I think it is one of the harsher chemotherapies as far as side effects.  It is the one I reacted to when they sent it in too fast-- had immediate pain shooting down my back / saw clear squiggly floating lines in my field of vision, stomach got very nauseated, face got flushed.  So just know that Taxotere's side effects will probably be experienced on some levels and take care of yourselves! Summer:   Istart my radiation today (33) like you.  I had a simulation/tattoos and additional markings yesterday -- oh my!  BLUE marks all over the place.  I am lucky in that where my radiologist is located -- only 15 miles from home and within the route I take to work.  I am doing mine in the late afternoon so if I need rest, I can lay down afterwards.   X-ray:  That is a GREAT photo of you!  Irishtess:  Oh my, yes!  Positive prayers that things line up and you'll be dancing a wonderful jig in Ireland in November.  Sounds like a divine time is planned with you and your family.  WONDERFUL!  :) As far as crying -- I think we all have our strong moments and our weak moments.  I think we push ourselves because it is a journey.  I got very upset the night before starting back to work due to wearing the \"wig\" and my husband couldn't understand my tears.  I was crying like a baby.  It was a mixture of emotions and just a whirlwind of accepting what I had gone through already.  I don't know about any of you but to think of joining in any walks or the like for Susan B. Komen next year and knowing I will be in the SURVIVOR area -- just blows my mind because part of me still feels like THIS ISN'T / DIDN'T HAPPEN TO ME.  Pretty wild!  Positive prayers /thoughts for those of you still walking the chemo walk -- as I am now starting the \"glow in the dark\" radiation walk.  I got MONKEY BRAINS again last night thinking of how funny it would be to do something to make myself GLOW while I was doing the weeks of radiation -- just for kicks.  Maybe buy those children's bracelets or something to wear that glow.  :)  LOL  Got to find the humor along the way -- tears of laughter is what we all prefer!  Keep on the positive side and if you have to complain -- go ahead and SHOUT IT OUT because we do feel your pain!  TOTALLY!  Much love!",

Hope everyone has a relaxing weekend!  I plan to CHILL OUT after working a full week (minus time off for radiation).  WHEW!  Much love!  Monkey brains Kim",

Leanna9:   Hurray on getting the disability set up.  I did mine too and that TRULY helped get some stress off my plate.  My reaction to the medication yesterday was another EYE OPENER to this is really something SERIOUS and don't kick myself to the curve and ride in on the horse of I AM WOMAN HEAR ME ROAR crap!  The bottom line is chemo is a toxic substance being placed in our bodies to KILL cells -- bad cancer and yet good life substanting other cells.  We can't give in and let it make us weak but we don't need to minimize our walk either -- any of us.  :)  You so made me laugh about the game.  Just so you know I haven't shaved my hair yet either.  Tomorrow . . . -- I have read some of the posting here so I think I won't have it shaved TO THE HEADBONE -- I think I will have it one up from that to avoid some of the rashes and sensitivity some have posted here.  Thought I'd pass that on to you.  I do look scary to me -- the thin patchy hair -- like an alien type of character.  But I have hats I am wearing and been out in public enough to have the confidence now that I am not going to be pointed at or treated weird -- that was my initial \"insecurity.\"  It builds the more I let myself trust that it will be okay -- finding my footing on that.  Our treatment room yesterday was FULL of people like 15 or more.  The nurses were slammed.  So when my body had that reaction -- clearly the VIBE of what the HECK was floating throughout the room.  Some folks have really serious illnesses they are being treated for and definitely don't need to have something freaking them out.  I was pleased they jumped on it because I don't know what would have happened next.  It is just a situation that happened and thankfully, proper care was there.  WHEW!  It seems we all are having things kick us about.  But we can do this! I don't look forward to the shot tomorrow that I know will set my body back if it is like the 1st treatment.  UGH!  But at least I am not lying about it being a walk in the park.  Day, I am with you in I've taken the Clairtin and the Extra Strength Tylenol and still the pain was there for me as well.  BUMMER and it stinks!  But thankfully, it wanes -- just getting through a week for me last time was what it took. Hugs to you all.  My heart is heavy with the knowledge of you guys with children at home.  Wishing none of us had this on our plates but wishing to the TOP degree that children at home didn't have \"moms\" walking this walk.  But know in my heart that it strengthens ALL of us that put one foot in front of the other -- on the other side, we are truly made bigger strength of character than before the walk -- all of us.  Much love!  CHEMO BRAIN -- MONKEY BRAINS activated by the darn steroid -- can't sleep -- oh well -- hope I am not keeping hubby awake in the next room with my type type type sound.  :)",
