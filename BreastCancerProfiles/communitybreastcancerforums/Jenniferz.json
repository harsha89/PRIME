The cold does effect the site, and I think it's because there isn't really any fat there to protect these old bones!

However, stress does mess up your auto-immune system, causing one to weaken and get many other illnesses, so why not have it help the cancer move along, too.  I was diagnoses the year I retired.....so really, there was no stress that was out of the ordinary.  OR, could there have been, and I just didn't know?  My father was murdered within the 8-10 year timespan when cancer develops, and that was/is traumatic, so---------------------?(Now cold case) One day, we'll know the answer.  Not going to stress out over what did cause the cancer, nor will I stress out over what mistakes I did or do that will cause it to start up again.  I just take each day as it comes, and do the best I can!

I am going to switch to, then he said he wanted to review my case with me.  Ok, I thought---this is interesting. He then asked how long it's been since my surgery.  It's been 18 months yesterday (yea, me!!).  He said that since I was er/pr+, and her2+, then the mastectomy was the best choice for me, even though my tumor was so tiny. He left to make copies of my records, and my mind just exploded. After a rapid discussion w/dh (who goes with me faithfully every time I get examined---thank God), we spoke to the surgeon again.  ALL this time, I have been thinking I was er/pr-, but knew I was her2 positive.  I asked him again about the pathology report, and he showed it to me: er/pr+.  There it was in black in white.  I swear, the onc said er/pr-.  I know this because he said I was one for three---meaning I was her2 positvie only.  It states clearly in the letter he sent my surgeon, that I was not a candidate for chemo or radiation in that I had a mastec. and n0, m0.  BUT, he put me on Femara, even though he told me I was hormone neg., and he wanted to give me something to make me feel like I was getting the best I could get. Bottom line is that I feel cheated.  18 months out, and I feel like I DIDN'T get the best.  Good grief I was triple POSITVE (as opposed to neg.)  I think it states in the pathology report that the tumor was .3 cm at the largest point.  I don't have it with me right now...I can post that later if someone wants to see. I had IDC, high grade, with one DCIS high grade as well.  If I read the darn thing right. Wouldn't you think I would have qualified for SOMETHING????  Am I now doomed??? I was feeling sort of good about things, but know all old doubts have fired up again, and the \"elephant has taken over the room\". My surgeon says I will have to be forever vigilant on the left side.  I had already figured that out as I do bi-monthly se's now.  A bit of an overkill maybe, but hey---. And I feel like I have not been truthful here.  I have been telling people, \"no-no er/pr-, but on Femara anyway.\"  I was thinking all this time it was just some sort of weird preventative this man had me doing.  Evidently not.  I can clearly remember this man telling both my dh and I that I didn't even have to take Femara....that all should be well for me in the future.  Because he misspoke himself, I was going to ask the new onc. if I could stop.  Don't think that's gonna happen.  I'll be taking this drug forever if need be!  Thin hair and all--- This year I really was enjoying the holiday season.  Now I sit here in absolute dread again. This creep....this man....I don't even know if he really read my records.  Just skimmed them.  Told me I didn't need Herceptin.  And now, the door closed. I don't know what I expect from you dear people.  There's nothing you can do.  I guess I just needed to get this off my chest. Thanks for listening. Jennifer Log in to post a reply",
