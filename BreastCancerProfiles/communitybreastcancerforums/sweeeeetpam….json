I only had m right breast removed, I had my chemo Before surgury, and all the tissues they sent to the lab during surgery were clean!!!       I asked my surgeon, if everything was clean they why would they still remove the breast he says because as of right now in 2008, they still remove it to be sure???  Has anyone else have the die put in their nipple, I screamed so loud i think everyone though they were killing me!!                   My surgeon would not let me stay a second day but set up a home nurse, which to be honest I think was a waste of money, becuase of my deductable rolling ove Jan 1st she only came today.                 The most painful part of this whole thing has been the ace bandage, no one on this site menioned that or if they had I missed it, my was so tight, and the nurese were afriad to loosen it, I have been loosening it a bit y bit today, it comes off tomorrow, and I don't think I am going to look down for about a year............................                         So far I feel good and I have movement in my arm he took the lymph nodes out of.  I am trying to go back to work in two weeks, I sit at a desk most of the time.

Where as if no chemo the cancer could spread very easily while you wait for surgery and then during..did that make sense??                I just got home form a/c feeling a little wierd, ate a big mac for the first time in 15 years...........still was not that good!!!                 Pray for no s/e!!!

Thank goodness out tomorrow someone please ell at me to go exercise my arms...........I have never exercised a day in my LIFE!!!I can raise my arm above my head so I guess that is  good thing.          hey was anyone else wrapped in a ace bandage when they woke up?????Sometimes I wish we could just all meet and talk, Stacy you are from mesa, AZ and one else?? i live in Gilbert and work out of Mesa??      My thoughts are with all of you .

I will write again tomorrow!! Pamela ",
