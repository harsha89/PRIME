I was diagnosed with Stage IV de novo BC (ER+ PR+ Her2 -) with mets to hip ribs spine and scapula. I took 4 rounds of AC chemo and then 4 rounds of taxotere and my PET showed partial response after both. My Onc no is considering hormonal therapy, and as I\u2019m Perimenopausal (53 years), he decided that I should take Tamoxifen for 1 year till my menopausal status are confirmed then switch to femara. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s correct as all I read was that I should have ovarian suppression with Zoladex and femara right from the start. Also I\u2019m concerned with changing tamoxifen after 1 year even if it\u2019s still working. What\u2019s your opinion and should I seek the help of another Onc. ? Thank you so much ladies.

That's the opinion of the PET CT scan, till I go to the Onc. on wed. \u201c The study is currently negative for the detection of any significant FDG avid residual viable tumor tissue involving the left breast primary or the old bone metastases keeping with good response to therapy. And no new developed metastatic lesions.\u201d Thank you.
