I guess it was also my way of telling myself that I was okay and would contineue to be so. My boss knew of my situation and I had absolutely no issues there. I was tired a couple of days towards the end, however it was not more than I was used to with two active boys. I did experience some skin issues and developed an infection about two months after radiation ended that was worse than the radiation itself. I think people need to just be aware of what works for them - if the hospital is not in a convenient location or if you are very tired, then take the time to rest and recuperate.",
