      "Content": "MrsLce wrote: This whole process started 2 years ago for me with pain and a small lump in my right breast...I was told by the breast surgeon after mammogram and ultrasound that it was nothing other than just extra dense tissue (no explanation for the pain)...then a few days after this past Christmas I began having other symptoms (back and chest pain all on the right side and discomfort in my right arm along with some shortness of breath) that I did not believe we're related to the ongoing breast pain...long story short I was eventually sent for a chest CT that indicated 3 very small nodules on my right lung...I was told that it was very unlikely that these were the cause of my odd symptoms and to come back in 3 months and rescan to make sure the nodules haven't grown...a week later my husband dragged me to the ER due to shortness of breath and some pain...The ER Dr was amazing and more thorough than any other ER doc I'd ever heard of...he pulled up every test I'd ever had including my most recent mammogram then calmly told told me that while he didn't want to cause any false alarm he felt that I may in fact have breast cancer and referred me to the same Dr who'd told me 2 years ago it was nothing...after telling my husband and I no less than half a dozen times that there was no way I had breast cancer she reluctantly ordered another ultrasound and the radiologist decided to go ahead and biopsy...lo and behold here I am now post bilateral mastectomy ( with brand new wonderful doctors) waiting to have my CT scans to make sure that the nasty ugly stuff hasn't gone further than the lymph nodes they found it in during my surgery...as always the waiting is terrible...While I do worry a bit about the nodules found on the earlier CT scan I'm keeping a very positive attitude...However, I'm wondering about what to expect of the actual CT itself...is it the same as a regular CT scan? How does it work? IV contrast? Do I drink something? I've heard different things and I'd really like to know what to expect so I will have at least one less thing to worry about lol :-) Thank you!!
