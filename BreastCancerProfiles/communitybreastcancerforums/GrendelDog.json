For some places, that is the default type of mammo your doctor would ask for, especially for denser breasts. But the fact that your mammo was followed up with an ultrasound would likely provide more overall info than getting an additional 3D mammo if that wasn't done already. It's so good to hear that they included ultrasound with the mammo and they looked at both the breast and the nodes. Sounds like they tried to be very complete for you!",

I've been trying to maintain my equilibrium as the date has gotten closer, but this last bit is not helping! Planning on calling the surgeon first thing tomorrow morning to find out if they will be cancelling (I am guessing yes, but not sure.) Meanwhile, my husband and I are juggling ideas of how to deal with options for commute (just under an hour), hunkering down at the hospital if snowed in, etc. I really hope they cancel. But I sort of hope they don't so I get it over with. It's always something!",

I hope all of you continue to do well with your recoveries! And get rid of your drains - I hated my drain. I'm having my own pity-party today. Got my pathology report. I've been doing really well after ALND and lumpectomy, but my surgeon had told me that they had removed an 'extra' mass found just under the nipple during surgery. The pathology came back and the additional lump was more cancer, so now I need another surgery to remove my nipple/areola complex. This is scheduled for next week. Plus, cancer was found in 4 of the lymph nodes out of the 18 removed - which means Stage III cancer instead of Stage II. And on top of all that, the chemo treatments I went through apparently had no significant impact on my cancer - either the primary tumor(s) or the lymph nodes. So, all in all, not a lot of good news today. Other than the additional surgery (which I'd been warned about as a possibility beforehand), none of it is that much of a big deal I suppose, but it was a lot of stuff all-together.",

It's easy and if you have it, the earlier they start treating it the better. If it isn't Lyme, no harm done. Anyway, I just found this thread (better late than never :) A lot of us seem to have the same story! I started out with a Stage IIa diagnosis with 1.8cm tumor plus a lymph node (from core biopsy). Due to the location of the tumor, we decided to do neoadjuvent chemo to try to shrink it to improve the odds of a good cosmetic result with lumpectomy. The tumor was right near the nipple/areola complex. Did 4 rounds of AC plus 12 of Taxol. The lump felt much smaller and ultrasound seemed to indicate that it was shrinking, too. Unfortunately, surgery had a different answer. I had 3cm of tumor plus 4/18 lymph nodes (all gross cancer). Fortunately, no extra-nodal extension. Phew! The pathologist said \"no definitive response\" to neoadjuvant chemo and provided a Miller-Payne response grade of 1 (out of 5). Plus, I've had 3 surgeries so far, and I'm waiting on the latest pathology report to see if I am finally looking at clean margins. I hate the waiting! So, yeah, went from IIa to IIIa and wasn't very happy. It wouldn't have been such a shock if everything hadn't given the appearance of responding. I knew going in that Grade 2 ER+ isn't usually a full-response cancer, but it was looking good. It was quite a blow to get that path report. I've looked at some of the studies, and I'd love to try PALLAS or PENELOPEB, but unfortunately, I had Thyroid cancer 4 years ago, and that's within the exclusion window. Crap! So, onward to rads and hormone therapy...",
