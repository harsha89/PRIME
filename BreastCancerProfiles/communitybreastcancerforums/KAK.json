Did you know that we all get about 45-60 units of radiation to our breast/armpit over the course of radiation?  This dose is divided into fractions, or about 2-4 units, which are called Grays (Gy), per visit.  If you were to get 1 Gy of whole body radiation, you will develop radiation sickness (you can Google this).  If you were to get 4 Gy of whole body radiation, you would likely die.  And yet, we get brushed off for feeling like crap after getting 45 or more Gy of radiation because, well, it's only focussed on a small area & it's usually done in a very precise focussed way & it's given in small fractions that we can recover from eventually & it doesn't kill us, so, hey, can't be that bad, huh??? Ladies, we have to take care of ourselves OURSELVES, if you know what I'm saying!!",

I'm better than I was, but I really haven't been the same since.  I do NOT have my normal energy back at all.  Have to pace myself differently.   In fact, I just did a weekend workshop about how to help BC patients as a rehab therapist and learned a lot.  Cancer fatigue is a very real thing and can be a long -term problem, so we are NOT nuts.  Gradually, gently getting back into exercise can help but it may work better if you go to a PT and have some guidance because most of us don't know how to pace our selves because we've never been through this before.  Also, I have a lot of scar and fibrotic tissue, which continues to churn up post rads (& will occur up to 2 years after rads are done) and know now that I need to get this worked on, too.  Now I know how to work on other people, but I need to get someone to work on me. So we all need to be patient with ourselves and especially not compare ourselves with other BC-ers who may \"breeze\" through things.  Most of us don't.  Not sure I believe anyone does.  And we need to keep sticking up for ourselves because even our best friends don't always get it that it can take a loooooooonng time to recover.   Luck to all.

Good luck, ladies.  I was flipping out a bit for my first rad treatment, but after that I was fine & it wasn't scary.  Just take good care of your skin.  But know that the burns & skin side effects will heal & go away.  Really!

I'm really happy to keep hearing more published reports about the 3-week rads protocol that I've gotten to do myself, even one here on the front page of bc.org.  I just finished my 2nd week & have had no skin issues to speak of.  I hope my luck holds out to the end.  I was really, really tired today, but that may have had to do with rads plus talking to my surgeon yesterday about the way my incision has scarred up. Sisters, I am glad to report that my surgeon was a peach about the whole thing.  She was very validating & compassionate & acknowledged that I must be very disappointed about this scarring since it seemed at first to be healing so well.  Nancy258, you're right of course, that there's nothing surgical that can be done for the time being, but I knew that going in.  I did get all my questions answered, though.  There is a good chance that if I keep massaging the incision, using Oragel on the nipple sensitivity & exercising, the adhesions could sort themselves out by the time six months go by, & if they don't, then I'll be able to talk to a PS if I need to. I have to say I cried my heart out when I was talking to the surgeon, because she was being so understanding.  I guess I needed to.  We all have to cry once in a while during this \"adventure.\"  And I got hugs from her nurse, who has always been lovely to me, & hugs from my girlfriend who came with me.  So, even tho' the bc adventure still bites, I feel grateful for the compassion that has come my way.

Nancy, I can identify on the pre-cancer, post-menopausal lack of energy.  I was already dealing with 3 years of learning to accommodate to hot flashes, lousy interrupted sleep & so forth before the cancer.  I was finally starting to feel pretty good, actually, and then I got diagnosed with BC.  But I have to say, compared to how I feel now, I was a ball of fire after menopause.  Good lord.  And instead of getting better over the past several months, I have felt worse in the past six months. Cancer -- the gift that keeps on giving. Good for you, Nancy, for starting recon!   Next year, if I feel normal, I'm going to go back to the PS to look into recon on my breast.  I've been told by her and my breast surgeon that tissue-wise, I would be a good candidate for a simple implant, which is the only option I would do because I need all my abs & my lats & all my other muscles for my job, so a flap is just not do-able.  I have all my skin, I still have my nipple, and my skin held up very well during rads.  It's just the rest of me that got trashed!!  We'll see.  It's on the back burner for now.  Keep in touch with us, Nancy, on your progress with all this.

Since my negative mamm, I've had a new round of my de-lumped boob forming adhesions,or maybe I've just uncovered some deeper ones that were hiding under the ones I softened up before the mamm.  Despite stretching pretty regularly, my shoulder motion will tighten right up again.  I know this is rads again.  When they tell us the effects last up to two years, they're not kidding. However, I went to a seminar this past weekend for PTs and OTs about how to treat this, as well as lymphedema, cancer fatigue and other issues we experience.  It was really awesome.  I met another \"sister\" there who was also a PT, and she and I got to be the ones who got massaged, which was fab.  I learned a lot of things which I'm going to use to put a homecare team together at work.  I think a lot of us don't get adequate post-op discharge instructions and could use some visiting help when we get home, even from day surgery like mine. Also, I met a few therapists there that I can go to for my own scar tissue, etc.  I really have felt very cautious about going to a therapist because I wanted to find one that would really know what she was doing.  Even as a PT myself, I've received bad PT as well as good PT, and I sure haven't wanted anyone who was clueless putting her mitts on me, epspecially if she was clueless and didn't know she was clueless (worst kind of therapist!). How are you all with scar tissue, adhesions, nerve/nipple pain, etc.? The Effexor Extended Release, which I just switched to from the generic, has totally resolved my nausea issues. It was 60 degrees F and sunny where I was this weekend, which was, amazingly, New Hampshire!!",

Nancy, I feel the same way about scar tissue.  I don't even want to go into, but just know that I'm with you, girl.  When my surgical swelling first went all the way down and I got a real look at how deformed I now was, I was devastated.  I still feel a kind of love-hate thing for my surgeon.  Yeah, she saved my life, but now I'm mutilated.  Oh, I hate this flipping disease.  Plus, where did our sun go???  I need the sun back!!",

Steph, how did yours turn out?   My one year mamm was clear & I was told I don't need to get another mamm for a whole year!  I'm sorry to report that I am still suffering from the fatigue that started during rads.  I've started taking Provigil for it, and it's helping but it's not been a magic bullet so far.  I'm also briefly participating in a research study on cancer related fatigue that will require 4 once a week visits to test a possible treatment for it.  So, it won't be curing anyone, but down the road might lead to more option.  If anyone wants more info on all this, send me a PM.  It's pretty common, unfortunately. Otherwise, I'm good.  How's everyone else?",

I've been really down for the count since I last posted with the combination of the cold & the end of rads. Turned out I had a sinus infection, so last Friday, my primary doc put me on an antibiotic, so I'm starting to feel better from that.  And I finished rads today!  Yay!  There was some confusion about whether I was going to get boosts, but no boosts, so I'm really done!  Congrats to NancyD, too!  After my last rad this morning, I went to visit two of my oldest gal pals, who first made me breakfast, then later took me out to lunch.  This weekend is the BC Waterfire in Providence, so I plan to go to that, too.  May have to do a bit of retail therapy this week! ;) Ace, NancyD, vhqh & everyone, they gave me Silvadene cream for the bad blistering/burning.   That Alra stuff sounds great, too that Makraz mentioned.  I started to get red last Wednesday & by today, I started having what they told me is folliculitis, where the hair follicles open up & get red & blistery/weepy. With the 3-week protocol, they told me I'm going to get worse all this week & maybe into next week, then get better.  I've been using straight aloe, but not too much Aquaphor because it's too goopy.  Today I put on the Silvadene, which did feel soothing & laid down with a soft-covered gel cold-pack on my whole breast.  That felt great!  I go back to see them in two weeks so they can see what my skin is doing. Ace, maybe you should call your primary doc about your asthma & not wait till you see the rad onc again.  One thing I do know about asthma (I get it if I have a bad allergy attack or a bad cold) is that lying down flat, like we do when we get rads, is a position that exacerbates bronchial inflammation.  In fact, I did have to use my inhaler last week myself before & after radiation, because of this damn sinus infection making me cough so much. I'm glad I'm not going to work this week!  I plan to go back next week.  I pretty much didn't have a choice about staying out of work this whole time since my lumpectomy, because I have to be able to lift patients in my job (I'm a PT), & my surgeon wouldn't allow me to do that kind of lifting for at least six weeks. Happy Thanksgiving to Roberta37.  I don't know, Roberta, you look pretty cute in your photo, even without hair!  But I send you lots of \"hair-raising\" thoughts.  You know, one of the ironies of this whole experience is that a year ago, I grew my hair long & sent it to Pantene's Beautiful Lengths program, which makes wigs for women with breast cancer!  So, who knows, maybe one of you out there is wearing my hair!!! Hugs, Kathi P.S.  Here's my blog link again, as requested:  www.kksphotos.com/blog.html   Enjoy!",

Yay, tchmuzik!  Yay, Skye!  Oh, gawd, Sharon, what is it with us rad girls & respiratory infections?  I suppose it makes a kind of sense that we're more vulnerable to catching something while we're getting zapped.  I've still got two more days to do on the Keflex they gave me & of course now the antibiotic is catching up with me & making me gassy!  I feel bad for anyone who's in the same room with me sometimes!!!   Did they give you Silvadene?  That kills staph & just about any other bugs in the universe.  And BTW, Sharon, I would be so bummed to have to be away from home during all this, it's totally understandable that you would have your moments about that alone, never mind any of the rest of this jolly adventure. All you Texas Gals, how the heck is the hurricane clean-up going?  Seems all we hear about now on the national news is about the financial crisis & credit crunch... and don't even get me started on that! I can relate to everyone's exhaustion.  The last two weeks of rads, with the infection & all, I could barely stay upright for half a day & slept like a log!  I've been thrilled this week to last until about 5:00 each day, but I'm down for the count by 7 or 8 each night. They were right about the SE's getting worse after the Vancouver protocol was done.  I've had the itchies pretty badly these last few days & my armpit is killing me.  There's one spot right in the middle of the armpit that burns like crazy.  I lay down yesterday after getting back from a visit to a plastic surgeon with a cold-pack folded into my armpit.  Ahhhh! Roberta37 & all Canadians & Canadiennes, hope you have a great holiday weekend. Ace, I'm glad you're almost done. Vhqh, it's great to hear that the brain zaps have gone well so far.  If your boss can't take a joke, by the way, you can always blame the whole thing on the zaps! Good luck to everyone.  I hope we all stay in touch until at least every one of us is done & has recovered from all SE's!  Then we can start a few more threads on tamoxifen, etc. Kathi",

I did use a soft-gel coldpack occasionally.  Maybe I wasn't supposed to but it never did any harm & sometimes it was the only thing that took the sting out of the burning & made my armpit swelling decrease.  I figured using the gel pack was okay because it's soft (mine is covered with felt on one side) & not quite as cold as regular ice so it wouldn't cause any stinging numbness.  It really was fine & my skin never blistered & it helped me get to sleep at night during the worst of the SE's.  I'm a PT so I guess I wasn't afraid to be maybe a \"naughty\" patient & I trusted my own judgment.",

Well, speaking of rads, yes, I'm having after effects.  My breast is still shrinking & becoming more deformed and muscles along my chest & armpit still keep tightening up & my nipple still hurts & my skin is still dry & I have to keep loading it up with lotion.  But the worst thing by far is the FATIGUE!    My PCP & I had a long talk about it recently & he ordered a bunch of labs.  The story they told was that all my blood counts are at the bottom of normal or just below normal, which is just how I feel.  I go along thinking I might actually be starting to feel like myself again, so I spend a few days or a week living the way I used to live, which just means, say, going out after work (there's been a chamber music festival in town) or having dinner with friends or something.  And then I crash & burn, and spend the next week or two paying for it in spades by having to crawl home from work & go to sleep.  Honestly, I've been too tired to eat this week sometimes!! My doc says this is unfortunately normal after rads.  And the rad onc did tell me this could go on for up to two years.  I'll scream if it does, but at least there's a reason I feel like this, I guess. Hope you are all hanging in there. xxoo",

Nancy258, women on another thread (Breast Reconstruction - Massage thread) have mentioned getting massage/PT all through radiation & that it helped a lot.  PT can teach you some good stretches to do, too, to keep your skin from tightening up.  I work as a PT, so I'm a little biased maybe (LOL), but shrugs, shoulderblade squeezes & range of motion of the shoulder/arm all help.  Also, after rads are done & the skin is not so sore, self-massage in the shower, where the tissue can get all warm & soften up a bit, is helpful. Wish I could get a way with wearing a T-shirt to work!!  Still stuffing Puffs Plus in my bras to keep the edges from rubbing too much on the red side.  My colleagues at work are now \"checking\" my progress every day by peaking at the upper middle corner of the rad field that is visible over the neckline of my scoop-neck tops to see how I'm doing!!  They are too cute.  One of my buds, a male nurse whose mom-in-law has BC bone mets but is hanging in there, keeps bringing in info for me & a PT colleague bought me a pink-ribbon lanyard to hang my ID tag on. My favorite thing, tho', is the \"smile on a stick\" that the speech therapist gave me!  Well, she would know why we might need one of those -- she survived stage 3 colon cancer a few years ago!!

Plus, I had friends that helped me a lot, but I still did most of my own driving, cooking, shopping, housework, laundry, etc., etc.  If you have kids, too, that's huge.   So, just be nice to yourself & get as much sleep as you seem to need.  After all, we're basically getting poisoned during rads (not to mention chemo!), so I think a little fatigue is a reasonable response!!

My rads are going okay.  When I finish tomorrow, I'll be half done!!!!  I am soooo glad I asked about & was allowed to do a shortened protocol.  I wouldn't have known about it if it weren't for the women here on the forums.  So, thanks again!  And thanks for all the tips.  I've had some mild redness & itching, but very fleeting & all the skincare tips have been helpful. My big problem continues to be the lumpectomy incision.  I am holding my breath that radiation doesn't make it worse & cause more problems with the scar.  I got my surgeon's office to move up my November appointment to this Friday.  I had a nurse friend of mine look at the incision today & she agreed 100% that it does not look right & needs to be fixed somehow. I'm trying to get another nurse friend to go with me to the appointment because I've been upset by this whole thing.  To recap, when the surgeon did the lumpectomy, she made the incision along the edge of the aureole.  This had nothing to do with where the cancer was, but only her notion of a better cosmetic outcome.  The first problem is that she never discussed this with me before the surgery.  She didn't ask me about my priorities or tell me there were any options about where the incision could have been.  I wouldn't have cared about having a small scar on the breast itself.  But she never asked me.  So, my nipple has been red & hypersensitive since the surgery.  When the whole breast was still swollen, the incision looked like it was going to heal flat & look normal.  Now that the swelling has gone down, the incision has tightened up, with my nipple & breast puckering on either side of it, & the tip of my nipple still red & sensitive.  I am very unhappy about this turn of events. Has anybody had any issues like this with their surgery?  Anyone else with an incision around the nipple?  I'm really frustrated & afraid now that I'm going to be told I can't get it fixed yet (if there is any way to fix it) & that I have to put up with this until the s/e's of radiation wear off, which could be months. GRRRRR! Kathi",

First things first, though.  I'm putting on my PT cap now.  See if you can wean off wellbutrin & onto celexa or lexapro or cymbalta, which are SSNRI's & don't decrease one of tamoxifen's metabolites like SSRI's & wellbutrin seem to do.  This is no time to be going without an antidepressant.  And just so you know, they're not actually certain that it matters much that wellbutrin & SSRI's decrease this one metabolite of tamox.  They don't block any of the others & they don't block the level of tamoxifen overall, so it may all be much ado about nothing.  They have not, to my knowledge, done any research yet that demonstrates a difference in the five-year effectiveness of tamoxifen between those who are on SSRI's while taking it & those who are not. But remember that you have options.  I may have to do the same thing myself.  I've been very happy with zoloft all these years, but if my med onc & I think I should try an SSNRI instead, so be it.  She hasn't recommended that yet, by the way, so we'll see.  Lots of people do even better with the SSNRI's than the other stuff & they are supposed to be helpful with the potential SE's of tamoxifen.  So, it might actually end up being a win-win situation.  Just talk to your doc about how to switch from one anti-depressant to another, because it's not advisable stop some of them abruptly. And how about we start a thread on the Hormone Topic that says, say, \"Finishing Rads/Starting Hormones\" or something like that?   Kristy, you're right.  We should keep the whole group intact, no matter what hormone we're starting.  I'll start it if someone else hasn't already. Ace, I love kids, too, & didn't get to have my own.  I'm 54 now & I would be having grandkids now if I'd had my own children.  But like you, I've \"borrowed\" lots of other people's kids over the years.  Your girlfriend's son is soooo lucky to have you in his life.  My mom was mentally ill, and I treasure the \"other women\" in my childhood who gave me their love & a safe place to escape to when my mom was too depressed or crazy to give me what I needed.  My aunts, my teachers, my friends' mothers, a lot of those women were & still are very special to me & made me realize how special it is for a child to have adult friends who are not their parents.  I very much believe in the idea that \"it takes a village\" to raise a child.

I work in homecare for the Visiting Nurses.  Homecare rocks!  I love doing it & I love my nurse buddies.  The nurses I team with the most, i.e., share patients with, are like my sisters & they have looked after me with great compassion.  All my colleagues have been completely awesome.  It makes me tear up just thinking about it.   I think it's really hard for us to be patients, to ask for help, to be on the receiving end of all this.  I was so glad when I finally did get back to work.   A day on the \"front lines\" of homecare is better than 5 minutes as a cancer patient!!   I have felt positively schizoid sometimes, because the clinician part of me will know certain things that the patient part of me has forgotten. Also, for virtually everything else, including a lumbar diskectomy 4 years ago, I have had no problem being looked after at the local hospital by my colleagues whom I've known & worked with forever.  But after the second mammogram, when I was told to get a biopsy, I went elsewhere to get followed & treated.  RI is a small state, so in a way, everybody in healthcare knows everybody else.  But as it turned out, I was glad I got my biopsy & breast MRI & lumpectomy & radiation, etc. & so forth at places where I could just be a patient who happened to be a PT & not where I would know everybody walking down the corridor.",

One of my favorite patients ever was a women on hospice care that I treated & was even her case manager sometimes, who died of ---- you guessed it --- breast cancer.  I met her when she started getting bone mets & having path fx's.  That was 12 years ago.  She gave me a silver-spoon handle that her daughter had turned into a key-ring, which I still have & use every day.  I think of her with great poignancy these days.

I think no matter how big or how small a part of our breasts we lose to this disease, it's traumatic.  I now often describe my very extensive lumpectomy as an amputation when I am talking to people, because \"lumpectomy\" & \"mastectomy\" don't quite resonate for the average person.  But most people can relate to the idea of losing half a leg or both legs, for that matter.  It's a huge thing & our breasts are an intimate part of ourselves, no matter how we think we feel about them. When the post-op swelling finally went down in my breast, I was gobsmacked by how misshapen it was, how much the nipple hurt, how the aureolar incision tightened up so that my breast & my nipple puckered on either side of it, how much hard, adhesive tissue formed inside around the edges of the excised tissue area.  Oh my god.  I was thunderstruck & like Nicole unprepared for how I felt.  My surgeon is a woman & a peach, and neither of us quite expected that because my breast looked awesome the first few weeks post-op.  I was so freaked, I was afraid to call her & get another follow up visit.  But I finally did, & when I saw her, thank goodness she acknowledged right away what was going on & validated my feelings, so I ended up just crying my eyes out with her.  It really allowed me to grieve so I could move forward.  One of my nurse buddies had driven me there that day, & we went out to her car afterwards & I cried all over again with her.  Made me feel a lot better.  I think I had been placing these unrealistic expectations on myself to take all this very stoically because I'm a \"professional\" & not letting myself be a patient. Once I gave myself permission to be human & let my friends know what I was going through, I was able to start healing for real.  But it's still a long process, both physically & emotionally. As I've said elsewhere, I feel like I've found out I have a stalker.  And I think I'll be looking over my shoulder for a long time. Kathi",

Ditto my choosing a woman PS.  I just could not go see a man & know that I was probably going to cry (which I did with her, too) & be talking to someone who would really have no idea what it was like to be in the position of having a mutilated breast.  Anyway, she said the same things pretty much that my breast surgeon said, that she thought my skin was looking great from the rads & that my scarring, lumpyness, nipple sensitivity & adhesions would all chill out a lot by the time I was 6 months post.  She definitely encourage me to massage everything as soon as my skin was recovered enough from rads.  She said if I still had all this stuff going on in 6 months, she could certainly remove the scar tissue.  But PS's don't generally touch you for at least six months after rads.  She also thought I'd be a good candidate for a simple implant if I wanted one, but that she wouldn't do that until a year out. So far, my breast has shrunk more from the cavity left by my slab-ectomy (!).  My rad onc said it was too soon to blame any of the shrinkage on rads.  So, I guess we'll both have to wait & see what happens.  I am a B/C on the unaffected side & was a B & slightly smaller on my cancer side before my so-called lumpectomy.  Now I'm an A on that side, too, so I know how you feel.   My breast tissue has started to be less hard, though, already, so I'm feeling more encouraged. I found the PS by looking on the American Society of Plastic Surgeons website.  You can search by specialty/procedure, like \"breast reconstruction\" & by geography.  So, I found a bunch of women who specialized in breast PS, including reconstruction & they're board certified.  Here's a link: http://www1.plasticsurgery.org/ebusiness4/PatientConsumers/findasurgeon.aspx Good luck.  Have you gotten a prosthesis or anything yet?

I'd like to hear more from anyone who's back to work after initial treatment.  Your posts have been helpful.  I'm back to work full time, although I have a schedule where I only work 4 days a week and squish my 37.5 hours into that, so it's about 9 hours/day on average, which isn't too awful, because I have one or two days off every two days.  So it's easier to hang in there knowing I'll be off soon. But when I get home, I'm still usually not good for much.  Plus I find it sooooo hard sometimes to be a clinician and a patient in the same body, if you know what I mean.  I think it's mainly that I'm only just over six months out from surgery, five months out from radiation, just had my six month post-op mamm, which was negative, thank god, and so I'm still actually a newish patient.  So, I've gotten past the initial terror, but I'm now in the recently-traumatized phase. It's actually been really helpful to be back at work and doing something useful for somebody else, but I get soooo sick of being a cancer patient, seeing doctors, taking my medicine, dealing with discomfort, side effects, etc.  Well, hey, I'm preaching to the choir, I know, because all of us on this forum understand what I'm talking about.  I think it's just that being a clinician somehow makes me feel a little schizoid on top of everything else.  I think being a clinician in healthcare just adds a slant to being a patient that has its good and bad points. Support, ladies?  I need some validation, because I'm having a hard time articulating this.  Am I making any sense whatsoever?  And of course, I'm still so tired.  At the seminar I just did, we talked about cancer fatigue at some length, which was helpful, because sometimes I think I discount its subtleties.

Omaha, you're on.  A friend of mine did the LI vineyard tour recently & said it was glorious! Meanwhile, my switch from zoloft to Effexor due to starting tamoxifen has not been without its bumps.  After 3 weeks of the 75mg of Effexor, I started feeling the depression blah's coming on, so my pcp said I can double the dose.  Hopefully that will kick in fairly soon.  I know you have to wait for these SSRI's & SSNRI's to kick in, but I'm not interested in feeling worse in the meantime!  Like I don't already have a few things to feel depressed about  --  like having cancer, for example! At least I'm a cheerful depressive, if that makes any sense......been dealing with it a long time.  It's a family disease & at least I've had it easier than my parents did, who basically had to grin & bare it because there wasn't much good out there for depression until the last few decades.
