So... I'm glad I've kind of already been contemplating mastectomy because I'll be surprised if lumpectomy is really any kind of option given that info - even with the size of my girls. Gabsbaba, I sure hope your MRI goes as smoothly as mine.  I swear if it weren't for all of the space-age racket, I just about could have fallen asleep in there.  But I can ignore/shut out almost everything - just ask my sons, lol.",

I can tell that the big M is kicking a little more into gear because my periods are starting to come a little farther apart than they ever have, but I don't know how long that will take.  I've been wondering if they would just give me medication now to finish the process since I'm probably fairly close to the end of it.  I'd rather that than more surgery.  But to be determined.  One of my friends lent me a book called There's No Place Like Hope.  I've just scanned through it so far but it looks like a really good read.  Here's one phrase for all of us today: Think positive whenever you can.  When you can't, call someone and have him or her do it for you.

      "Content": "Mar 17, 2012 10:48AM - edited Mar 17, 2012 01:46PM by IndigoMont11 HI ladies!  I got the camisole idea from our buddy Melrose (had never heard of them before, of course). I Googled them and found out there is a store here in Denver that sells them called Pampered Passions, but they also have a big online store.  Here's a link: www.pamperedpassions.com\\medical-apparel I haven't gotten there yet and I'm not sure which is the \"best\" one (or best for me anyway).  I was going to ask them some questions when I made it over there.   I know, Tammy - when I first heard that my surgeon was looking for a partner I thought he was handing me off to someone, too - and then when they explained it I got it.  I hear that all the breast surgeons there are excellent; hope so.   I don't even own any button down shirts to speak of; so I'm looking for those too.  I ordered a couple online that fasten with velcro because I have a feeling even buttoning won't be easy the first few days.  None of it suits my vanity very well either, but I'm trying to keep telling myself it's temporary.  I am jsut so self conscious.  When our sons were born I couldn't nurse them in public. But... we'll see how it goes.  Everyone here who's been through it is pretty encouraging for the most part.  My son offered to do my hair, lol.  What the heck. Karri, ouir one dog is a cream color and is a total love, but she sheds EVERYWHERE, and her fur is like my hubby's acupuncture needles - it actually gets stuck in fabric.  She claimed the \"best\" corner of the couch for herself.  At least our furntirue was pretty shot already.  When we bought the chair yesterday hubby also found a couch.  It is not fabric covered so hopefully will be easier to clean.   Hubby has a hard time sleeping so I figure I'll just be in the living room away from him and if I can't sleep, I can have the lights on, watch TV, read, whatever.   I just want to get this show on the road.   Hugs to all!",

He was very scholarly; I was proud of myself that I understood all of his terminology. In a nutshell, as I thoughtsfter the MRiI report, the affected area is large enough, and the big tumor has lobular features, which would make getting clear margins harder, so lumpectomy not ag real option. I asked about chemo first to shrink the cancer but since it isn' t HER2 positive, the cancer would ptobably not respond as well, so I thought it sounded like postponing the inevitable. So that left it as a simple mastectomy. I had hoped for immediate recon but unfortunately that will have to wait. After I asked aboutthe chances of getting it on the other side and heard ten percent, it took me msybe a few hours to decide a one or two percent risk of recurrence sounded better. So I'm right behind you Gabsbaba, retiring the girls after 51 years. Hubby is freaking out. :( At least my boys are with me. I need a hug so bad right now.",

As he said, I had no hoarseness or sore throat afterward. I didn't have immediate recon so my surgery took about 4 hours, I think, by comparison. It may be that with the longer procedures they might have to do a different intubation. Since you don't normally talk with the anesthesiologist until right before surgery, I recommend you find out if you can who it will be and ask them beforehand. Also - last little piece of advice- ask them for a nausea patch. They put one on me during prep and it worked like a charm; had no nausea whatsoever. They told me to keep it on for 3 days after surgery and I never had any problems.",

The RO's office didn't want to tell me much before I get referred to them, but they did tell me they do the tattoos, not sharpies.  That's okay with me; my bikini days were over a long time ago, and I'd rather not have to deal with getting drawn on multiple times or worrying about the ink staining my shirts.  ",

The biggest downer for me though; it means a copay every treatment.  I am lucky that I'm able to work through this, and I have good insurance, and $40 isn't much here and there (i.e., for the chemo), but 5 days a week for 6 weeks will definitely be expensive, not to mention driving there every day.  *sigh*  I have just about exhausted my flex spending plan because I didn't count on the BC diagnosis and didn't make my allotments high enough prior to the first of the year, and am holding off on putting through any more reimbursements because my prosthetics will probably take the rest of the money still available.  I do have a savings account I kept open after paying off my car loan last year and fortunately, it is in a location not that convenient for me to get to, so I've been able to let it build up. ;-)  It will come in handy for those rads treatments.   Sorry to whine about money - so far, in my case, the rads plan has been the biggest \"sticker shock\", but of course, I will do it!  I'm glad that if we have to do this, we'll all be in good company.  ",

Unfortunately not fluid filled cysts this time, but solid.   They were really nice and patient with me - explained everything and let me have all the time I needed with the scheduler, who was almost like a counselor, to regroup.  I'm in the position now where they aren't saying for sure, but they are saying it is highly suspicious, which I've never heard before.  I've kind of been prepared for this, and in my heart of hearts, I know I'll be up to this challenge and will win.  I am looking at it as a test of my courage (one I didn't ask for but...).  At least, this time sounds easier than the core biopsy I had back in 2005.  That one was the stereotactic biopsy and I had to lie on my stomach for two hours.  This time they said I will be able to lie on my back and it should take much less time.  The best thing about today?  I've gotten so many hugs!!  Sending hugs and prayers also to everyone else waiting out there. Let me know, shrnbrbz, how it goes for you!",

Hard to believe sometimes, because until I started tweezing as a teenager, I had really thick Brooke Shields of the '70s brows! I strongly recommend using a powder kit, like the Too Faced one mentioned by . My favorite is actually this kit from Glo Minerals: http://www.gloprofessional.com/product-type/makeup... I started using it during chemo and I love it. It comes with everything you need, and the flat angled brush is perfect for making \"hair\"-like strokes. Like some of the other kits, you get two colors that you can blend or use by themselves. I don't use the wax or the highlighter, though. I don't think the wax really works if you don't have hairs to start with, and the highlighter isn't really as good as shadows, anyway. The powders wear really well on me. The kit also comes with several stencils, but I usually draw my brows freehand. And the powders are paraben free.",

Iago, were you a fit person before your surgery?  I'm not a smoker or drinker and my health looks like it's perfect except for the cancer, go figure.  However, after losing 30 pounds in 2004, I did what I *said* I would not do and gained 25 pounds back.  My big plan for this year was to work on improved fitness.  The bunion surgery derailed me a little bit but I'm back to taking good walks.  I just hope I'm fit enough to heal like you!  If the bunion surgery was any indication, the first week after that was the hardest too, and I ended up having to wait to take a full shower until the stitches were out in 2 weeks.  Ossa - I remember the 1980s band Chilliwack!  Are they still around at all? Doing it for you, not to you... I can remember that!!  I'm just trying to convince hubby.",

[but yesterday, the radiologist disagreed and did not biopsy this.  Little whew.] IMPRESSION: Suspicious. This is more or less what they told me, except I didn't realize there were \"multiple\" smaller masses; they just mentioned one, and only biopsied the bigger one and one other area.  They did also tell me that based on prior history, they knew that I have had multiple cysts, so maybe that's what some of those masses are since they didn't specify that they were \"solid.\" I'm taking another deep breath and trying to refocus on work....  At least, the biopsy sites hardly hurt at all today - didn't even take a tylenol this a.m.",

But otherwise, all margins were clear and there was no skin or chest wall involvement. I see the oncologist on 4/4.  Pretty sure chemo will be next! Hugs to all - your support helps so much.",

I am almost (only) 3 weeks from my BMX and struggling not to feel frustrated that I still have enough discomfort (pain, burning feelings, tightness) that I still take OTC pain relievers every day and still don't sleep well w/o ambien, which I had never taken before all this. While I can't say that I'm miserable, and feel well enough to take walks and do some other normal activity, I seem to need daily reminders that it's OK not to be able to tackle all the grocery shopping right now because I get too tired. All the very best to you ladies as we all continue our journeys! Thank you for sharing. One quick qustion: I haven't been able to sleep on my left side yet (the cancer/LND side). How long was it before you could sleep on your \"bad\" side?",
