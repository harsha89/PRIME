The grade 2 business has me a bit concerned...but without the details, there is only the waiting. Hoping you don't need the chemo, 4faith... Eph_12, wow, your onco score!! It gave me the chills, since your Dx looks so 'ok'...and so like mine.  May you be continue to be juuuuuuust fine!",

I'm with you...the simpler the better. Who needs Niagra in the shower? So I have my DMX post-op PT starting tomorrow, and the steri-strips havent even fallen off. Now I *do* know (intellectually at least) that it won't all pop right open again because it's been over 2 weeks, but, sheesh, it was just glued together. Is it just me or does this creep anyone else out, too? And apologies to all the PTs out there, but I'm nervous, expecting it to **hurt**!  Maybe I'll be wrong...hope so!",

I'm another newbie. 11 days post BMX; the path came back IDC, 0.7cm, Stage I, Grade 2, 0/15 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2-...the prophylactic MX on the ipsilateral breast came out clear, only w/ microcalcifications. Soooooo...1st appt w/ an oncologist on the 8th, hoping to not have to do chemo. My surgeon did a fabulous job, and said that I would probably only need aromatase inhibitors...but ther's a bit of nervousness about the Grade 2. It's borderline, but the nuclear score bumped it up from a 1.  Been reading the science and am left with the impression that it's a crap-shoot... Does anyone else out there w/ a similar Dx and surgical intervention have anything to share about skipping the chemo? (There are sooooo many posts here, sorry...no energy post-op to go back and look!) And Sheila, I'm in Hawaii, too (was born and raised here, but mostly have been living overseas recently...just happened to be home for a while in May and thought I should get a mammogram, 'in case'. PHEW!! I feel **very** lucky.) ...Anyway, I hope you're having a **very** sweet time!",

Oooooyyy, Melmes, adding insult to injury...zits on top of chemo...well, may they go away soon and may you go from strength to strength! There's something you can get in healthfood stores that might help if the acne continues...Desert Essence Tea Tree facial wipes...they've helped me in the past with that--they're cleansing, astringent, and naturally antiseptic....",

In a lovely post BMX interlude...won't see my oncologist til the 8th; have already ordered the oncotype dx, just waiting for results. I'm not in any hurry to jump ahead of myself and do anything but heal, but it's really good to read how different people respond to different meds.  4faith, I agree w/ sherryc and others who've suggested the test..10% of us T1 N0 M0 are at higher risk, and so benefit from chemo...and that's really the only way of telling. Hey, Granny, you're good, no matter what! Thanks for the blessing of your laughter and big heart. And Ducky...where arrrreeeee you? Thank you both for being you!",
