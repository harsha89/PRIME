I took xanex for a short period of time during all of my testing.  I definately took it the day of my stereotactic and it helped .  I am sorry you have to go through any of this but you have come to the right place.  These boards have the most amazing people you will ever meet in your life.  They will embrace you and give you the inner strength you never knew you had.  They are filled with knowledge, love and understanding..... Gentle hugs my friend.... Debbie",

The insurance company will never pay the money to go to court to arbitrate!  You have to give as much information as possible in your letter.  Have a letter attached from your doctor explaining the reason for clarification with an MRI.  Also...use words like you feel your insurance company is discrimating because you are not following their protocol of necessity.  Flood your letter with attachments from articles showing support for lumps being felt, density of breasts yada yada yada.  Also include as many articles as you can why MRI's are approved for many patients.  This is an on going battle.  They would rather approve a biopsy than an MRI. DO NOT GIVE UP ON THIS.  The only one keeping their money is the insurance company.  I just wrote a letter of appeal for my girlfriend and won her right for an MRI.  Her insurance actually had some ridiculous clause in it stating...TWO members of her family needed to have a positive pathology in order to approve a breast MRI.  Meanwhile she had two areas of concern showing on ultra sound and mammo.  We fight like hell and won.  Her sister has breast cancer and we threatent to sue them for denying her.  We also flooded the letter with many attachments.  Happy to report..she got her MRI and thankfully she is fine! Be that squeeky wheel.  Good luck! Debz",
