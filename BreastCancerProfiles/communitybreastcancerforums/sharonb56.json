I had my biopsy on Tuesday and I am scheduled to see breast surgeon on Friday. My question is how could he be so sure just by the mamogram and the ultrasound? I have been worried out of my mind and the waiting has been the worst part. Just curious if others were told anythng similar. Log in to post a reply",

I am scared but coping for now. They will also do a sentinel node biopsy at that time. My breast surgeon says that i will see oncologist about a week after surgery and he will outline my treatment from there. I will have radiation and maybe chemo. it is all happening so fast now. The surgery will be day surgery. Thank you for the support ladies, it means the world to me. Hugs to you all!",

She told me that there is no way to be sure without biopsy. I am just so glad that i get the results tomorrow and will at least know for sure what i am dealing with. Thank you so much for the support, I was feeling so isolated until i found this site. Will post the results of my biopsy as soon as i get them. If it is cancer I am sure i will have tons of questions of what to expect from women that have been there..Hugs to you for your support",

My appointment is at 9am tomorrow morning which seems like a life time away. This last week has been so stressful, wish i would have found this site sooner. I have so many questions and concerns. I just need the full picture from the B.S. and then maybe you guys can help me sort through the information. I am taking my cousin who is a breast cancer survivor with me to the appointment, that way she can help me understand what is being said.Â ",
