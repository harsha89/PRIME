    "Content": "Carrickmum71 wrote: hi all, I had a mammogram and US two years ago on right breast as I had a small amount of thickening under the nipple, both came back clear(normal)!! Fast forward 2 years, went back to GP as I noticed a small dent on lower side of same breast and a tiny patch of thickeni above nipple (same breast as before) GP refered me back to the hospital for more tests, I now have pain at the side of my neck other side and I am extremely tierd(have been for abt 6mthd), was just wondering if the pain and tierdness could be BC symptoms also, Dr noticed the dent, I myself can only see it when my arms are by my side or with hands on hips!! my right Breast is also slightly bigger but I think it has always been like that, just more noticeable now with age I'm 45 and mother of 4... Any replies appreciated.. Will keep posted when apt arrives, Dr has said can take upto 4 weeks.. Log in to post a reply",
