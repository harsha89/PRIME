I did not really utilize this site until I had bad hives about a week after my third round + Neulasta shot. I found out we are the experts on SE :) When I asked my Nurse Practitioner if the hives were normal, her only response was, \"Any abnormality is not normal...\" Well, that and her \"what a stupid question\" look! I am a 43 year old Air Force Reserve pilot. I found my 1.2 cm lump on my right breast while I was deployed in Dec 2014. Diagnosed in Jan. (ER+, PR+, HER2- IDC) Sentinel Node Biopsy in Feb: 0/7 involved :) I had already decided on BMx/chemo/Hysterectomy before finding out I am BRCA2+. Bilateral NSMx was accomplished 16 Mar, with right nipple removal one week later due to pathology report showing DCIS in areola area. My unaffected breast tissue showed three additional <1mm IDC. PET Scan on 9 Apr was clear. I just finished 4/4 rounds of TC on 18 Jun. I meet with my Gyno Onco on Weds and have my post chemo blood test/MO appt on Thursday. I have tissue expanders in and was planning on expanding during chemo, followed by implant swap out, but an incision on my right breast became an open wound after my 1st round...will need a DIEP flap. I have a bilateral DIEP flap surgery scheduled for 24 Aug. Since I started chemo, I began walking with my female Doberman Pinscher. I keep pretty active with my three little boys, 3, 4, and 6. I often pray for patience. I get frustrated sometimes because it takes so much effort to do nothing...I was so used to being healthy. I wish I would have joined this page sooner, instead of dealing with everything on my own. My rehab people were very supportive, but I finished last week. I am here to gain/give insight and share positive energy. I am happy, yet anxious about my next few steps. I'm blessed and very happy to be alive! What a perfect weekend to come across this group...celebrating Independence Day, especially with KSusan's inappropriate picture!!! LOL!!!",

      "Content": "Sep 12, 2015 11:04AM - edited Sep 12, 2015 11:05AM by samaileko I'm sorry that I just pop in every once in a while...I just finished my DIEP Flap a little over two weeks ago, have three little boys, (oldest is six,) and my husband is deployed. I just want to tell Gingeel that after my last chemo, 18 Jun, I figured I would feel better than my others, but it was actually a lot harder. I think it may have been a mental concept that affected me physically. My thoughts were the same as yours...I should have been feeling great after two weeks. I was experiencing thigh muscle weakness, (feeling my legs were going to give out, especially going down steps,) calf cramps, (especially in the morning or sitting for a while,) and serious fatigue. I was also retaining water in my legs, I think. I found an older post in the discussion boards that described the exact feeling. (If I can find it, I will send it your way.) That person was given a diuretic, but I just decided to stay on top of my hydration better. She talked about all the science behind it, but I can't quite remember. All I know is I could not do my normal 1.5 walk two days in a row or I would crash pretty hard. Odd thing is, after my DIEP flap surgery, I no longer have those symptoms. No more tippy-toeing to the bathroom in the morning or feeling I'm going to fall down the stairs. I think it might have been all the IV fluids that finally flushed all the chemo out. I am struggling with low iron because I lost a lot of blood during my surgery and my body is not quite able to provide and build just yet, so I'm on iron elixir. My onco said I may have to have a transfusion if my counts are not up by the time I have my hysterectomy in December. I had a small bout of depression, but as soon as my PS told me the rationale behind it, I popped back. The first week was really rough, physically, so I kind of doubted my decision of reconstruction. She said I didn't experience it with the bilateral mastectomy because that surgery was accomplished to save my life. She said I will feel better, when I feel better, (if that makes sense,) and I do! At my onco appt on Tuesday, she said after the treatment is done, we have to watch out for kind of like an aftermath depression...once all the busy busy time stops. She said it's best if I can work through without meds, but she can always give me something. Probably a support group would be better :) Gotta run. Most gracious blessings to all of you! ",

I am sorry to have disappeared on you all, but I made the mistake of scheduling stuff post-chemo with the mindset of \"I should be good by then...\" There were a couple of things I had to deal with that I didn't schedule: my 6 year old going to Camp Kesem for the first time - a camp for kids with a parent affected by cancer. My 5 year old's birthday party. My husband heading off for work. I have to go back and catch up on your individual progress, but I'll bring you up to speed on mine: I am almost 2 months post chemo. I had terribly sensitive skin, with hives for the slightest bump, which equalled lymphedema in my right hand. I bought and wore a compression glove and sleeve anytime I drove somewhere or did laundry/house work. That has since subsided and I no longer have sensitive skin/hives and I feel less vulnerable. My legs are fatigued and shaky, not so much going up stairs, but mostly going down stairs. They feel like jello, after a really hard workout. I also have stiff muscles/joints and sensitive feet in the morning or sitting in one place too long. After I move around it gets better. My wrists were kind of weak, but has somewhat improved in the last week. I think I have been retaining water in my legs. I have not lost my extra ten pounds after my last round of chemo. I'm receiving a shot of Lupron, once a month to suppress my ovaries until my hysterectomy in December. Same side effects as my chemo pause... My hair has started to grow. With the summer heat, I have gone without a head covering, except if I want to look pretty pretty. Most people are kind to me and little kids cannot help but stare, but it's cool and temporary. (I say, \"I've been pretty for 43 years, I can deal with looking like this, if it gets me another 43 years!\") I also have the skunk head look, dark on sides and white/less hair on top. In the last week, it has begun to feel soft instead of pokey. I use a scrubber, Japanese washcloth, on my body and have started using it on my head as well. It exfoliates nicely. All my body hair is coming back too. My husband's friend asked if I started getting ingrown hairs yet, (his mom had breast cancer,) and I have not. I think it's because I use this exfoliating cloth and we have a water softener: Salux Nylon Japanese Beauty Skin Bath Wash Cloth/towel I still have an open wound from my mastectomy in March, but have my reconstruction scheduled on 24 Aug. I have a hydrocolloid bandage on it, but it's just covering the hole surrounded by necrosis. The Doctor will remove my tissue expanders and replace them with a DIEP flap. I'm a little worried about this surgery/recovery. My husband will be deploying about 2 1/2 weeks later. My mother in law lives with us and helps out a lot with my 3 little boys. I have been off all medications for a few weeks now. Prilosec was the last one. I hope to check in more often, but I guess I'm trying to pretend everything is back to normal, even though my body reminds me every once in a while that it's not. Blessing and smiles to you all! ",

Thank you for your posts, as I experienced the same hives, along with labored breathing, about a week after my 3 out of 4 Cytoxen/Taxotere treatments. I also felt like I was having a heart attack/muscle spasms radiating through my chest and back. I was prescribed steroids and a topical cream for the hives and Prilosec for the intense indigestion. The Prilosec helped, but I also took Alka-Seltzer antacid/antigas chewables. We only had an ear thermometer and my husband was convinced I had a fever. I was pretty certain it was from the awful hives on my ears. My husband called the on call onco and he prescribed an antibiotic. (It was Saturday and I did NOT want to go the ER!) When my husband picked up my meds, he also got me benedryl and an oral thermometer. My hives calmed down after taking the antibiotic and benedryl. I did not have a fever. I didn't quite believe my doc when she said it was too late to be a reaction from the chemo, because I did not remember doing anything different. However, last night, I sprayed bug spray on my hands and in about twenty minutes, I began feeling hives starting. I have been off benedryl for about three days. I took Benedryl and felt relief almost immediately. I had also sprayed myself the first time I had the hives, but it took about a day to breakout, so I completely forgot about using the bug spray. I was worried about my 4th round and was contemplating asking for benedryl with my treatment, but now I feel it's a new allergy to bug spray, caused by the chemo, (like mdg said on Jan 4,) but not an allergy to the actual chemo. I think that's why Benedryl worked for me. I will do my best to update after my 4th round on Jun 18...I will be prepared to request Benedryl in my IV if I feel a reaction during chemo and ask for Zyrtec/Pepcid like peanut323 recommends if the Benedryl stops helping. Thank you for all the help! Take care...",

      "Content": "Jun 25, 2015 11:22AM - edited Jun 25, 2015 11:34AM by samaileko Thanks for the encouragement, Marksgirl! I guess I'm about a month behind you :) I am having a DIEP Flap surgery at the end of July and will start meeting with a onco gyno to start discussing my hysterectomy. (I am BRCA2+.) Have you experienced more SEs since your chemo finished? After sharing my issues with my onco pre-chemo, she added Benedryl to my cocktail, my choice, and it knocked me out! I had a Neulasta shot the next day, Friday, followed by a low grade fever over the weekend. Called the on-call doc and he said it's probably from the Neulasta since I did not have any other symptoms of an infection. He told me to take tylenol and it brought my fever down. I was also feeling anemic, light headed with a strong headache, so I forced myself to eat well, (telling myself I will feel better if I do,) drank lots of fluids, and more rest than normal...drowsy from taking Benedryl. I'm still taking Prilosec every morning, antacids/antigas after meals, and benedryl when my mild hives begin to affect my breathing. They pop up when I'm too active, so if I notice them on my hands or feet, I rest and relax. They come on a lot quicker when I'm stressed out, then I take two benedryl. I think I only took two doses yesterday... I have three little boys, 3, 4, and 6. I am really fortunate that my husband and mother-in-law are both so loving and supportive. They tell me to rest and shelter me from stress. I am so blessed! My right eye is still twitching, but I'm confident that will go away again. Kayboxer, I felt the same as you regarding lying in bed and was taking Claritin as directed for my Neulasta shot. I walked everyday around my neighborhood, a 30-40 minute walk, until it started flooding here in Oklahoma. I did not get the hives from hell until my third round. I completely understand that you don't want to be lying in bed, but until your hives stop developing and at least turn into bruises, you will be miserable! I have to always pray for patience because I try to will myself to be strong and push myself to stay normal. My hives began calming down, and I wanted to take care of some minor housework. I ended up with hives on my hives!!! I finally stopped fighting it, even set up alarms to wake me up every four hours to take the benedryl. I mostly slept normal hours, 2130 to 0630, but started watching Orange is the New Black on Netflix to help me just rest. (Just think of it as a means to an end.) I was concerned that I was going to be on fire again this round, but I wasn't. I just take benedryl when I see/feel hives developingon my hands/feet. I found out I had developed an allergic reaction to bugspray and someone else developed an allergic reaction to her laundry detergent. I have always had Physical Urticaria and I know that plays a part in my hives. Also, I usually gained 10-15 pounds the first two weeks of chemo, because of constipation and being less active. (I found a routine of miralax, colace, and milk of magnesia to fix that without giving me diarrhea.) Then by the time I went in for my next treatment, my stomach was feeling better, my \"puffy\" face went away, and was back to my normal weight. Hope you feel better soon!",

I went to buy compression garments for my right arm as lymphedema prevention, so I really deviated from my normal routine. I suppressed the hives with 2 benedryl every four hours, setting an alarm to wake me at 3 am. I made a list of everything I ingested or applied to my skin yesterday and will avoid those things. The only thing I really can't avoid is water. I am not sure how long I will have to use benedryl, last time it was for about a week. I am still taking Prilosec every morning. I will update when I stop taking benedryl or if it stops helping. I am happy that it is controllable...",
