Pet scan showed no other involvemant, no spread. Path report showed a much larger tumor than they thought after neoadjuvant chemo at 10.4 cm, and 3 axillary nodes with cancer. I am still cancer free and still no spread. I had a 4 and 6 year old at diagnosis. Its a bumpy ride, but I can tell you, I worry the least about the cancer coming back.",

I was clinical 3C with rotter and intramamary node involement along with multiple matted axillary. They thought I was multicentric as well. Turns out my cancer looked like a big cauliflower or broccoli head and the chemo plus keytruda ( I was on a trial) knocked off the heads but not the base. I was left with a 10.3 cm mass and 3 positive nodes. Rotters was not visible on last MRI and my surgeon did not want to take it, and they leave your intramammary alone. Last PET back in November gave me the all clear. I found a calculater by MD Anderson of great help for us neoadjuvant group with residual cancer. Can't post it here though. Oh and my pr status was a 90% prior to chemo and 2% after. My MO said it just happens and is not something they worry about. Im at UCSF in the SF bay area so I feel a fairly good hospital. ",
