I had bilateral mastectomy on a Thursday, and on Sunday, 10 days later, the surgeon on call for my own surgeon's practice (weekend duty) reopened about the outer third of each incision to drain & clean out a staph infection. Had a four night stay in the hospital so they could treat the staph with IV antibiotic.  The incisions healed fairly comfortably both times. But then, I didn't have time to really become nervous about having it reopened. Knew about noon that it needed to be done, and the hour of surgery was over by 6pm. And soon after I was fortunate enough to be enjoying dinner. The best of good wishes to you! June ",
