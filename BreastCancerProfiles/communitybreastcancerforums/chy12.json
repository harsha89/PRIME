      "Content": "chy12 wrote: Hello everyone! I'm new here so forgive my newbie questions. To start, I have many fibroadenomas and dense breast tissue. A few months ago, I started having stabbing pains in my left breast, lasting all day. Uncomfortable enough and distracting enough to prompt another self exam after I got home from work. I found a fairly large lump located at the 6 o'clock position, under my nipple. I had a gyn appt the following week (for a hysterectomy) and she referred me to get a mammogram. To make a long story shorter (sorry!) They found the lump as a large cyst but also found a \"mass\" beside it. They said it could be another fibroadenoma but they can't be sure because of the dense tissue. they set another appointment for 6 months out to check it again. In the meantime, I've developed a very sore spot, not in my armpit but lower, about two inches. My question is, could this pain (It's persistent and painful to touch sometimes) be related? should I be worried or can I relax? Thank you for listening to me drone on! Any help is appreciated!!

They didn't give me a copy but sent me a letter saying that the doc thought the mass was probably benign due to the fact that it had a few of the characteristics of the other fibroadenoma that was biopsied before. The letter also said it was very hard to tell because of the dense tissue. They did look under my armpit on the ultrasound but at the time, I didn't have any pain there and there was no mention of anything, so I'm assuming they didn't see anything. I'm probably worrying for nothing but I'm a childhood cancer survivor so I'm always aware of what goes on in my body ‚ò∫",
