They did an ultrasound on the lump under my arm and determined it is a lymph node.  The radiologist came in and said that the lymph node, although enlarged, \"looked benign\" and basically decided to take a watch and wait approach.  Is that normal? I cannot help but to still be worried. Any advice? Log in to post a reply",

I know it is helping a little bit with the anxiety (As anxious as I am on it, I can't imagine what I'd be like without it!) Maybe the Xanax will help take the edge off while you wait.
