I'm wondering about this...I only slept for one hour on Friday night (7 to 8 on Saturday morning, to be exact), then was up all day on Saturday.  I went to bed at nine last night and slept for 14 hours.  Could not getting sleep at all the night after treatment have caused my counts to go down that much? I'm a terrible insomniac in the days after treatment.  I'm surprised I slept so much last night.",
