I\u2019m 29, I\u2019ve been nursing 6 years and I\u2019m currently still nursing my 2 yr old. I know my boobs. I\u2019ve had mastitis or huge clogs 15 times (most times I treated myself since it\u2019s just common for me at this point). What I found a few weeks ago is not a clog and I\u2019m pretty worried. I had a clog 4 weeks ago and I worked it out no problem but since working that one out I felt a hard fibrous veiny lump to the right of my Areola on my right breast. I do monthly checks and there\u2019s never been anything there. It\u2019s shaped like a Pea with a thick tube off one side? No pain at all. I have an appointment Thursday at 10:30 and a sono after (my mom had a rare choroidal melanoma tumor so I am naturally a worst case scenario planner). Log in to post a reply",
