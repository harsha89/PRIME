As for the full hysterectomy versus only an ooph.....My OBGYN/Oncologist said that with the Tamoxifen I was taking it was causing really bad cysts that were suspicious for cancer....There were also solid masses in my uterus from the Tamoxifen....... As for the last question I don't see why your oncologist would turn this test down....It only tells them if you are metabolizing the Tamoxifen efficiently........If you aren't matabolizing it then it won't do you any good..... Hope this helps you somewhat........",

Just wanted to add .........When i had my nipple surgery my doctor also did some tweaking of my right breast so I had yet another drain BUT that one the nurse ended up pulling out in RECOVERY!....SO  I wound up going home with a big hole on one side with no stitches (the PS was PISSED by the way!) and I ended up with fluid buildup but not enough to have drained.....When I got home after surgery (it was out patient), I was sitting on the couch with my computer and I felt something wet under my arm..I had my hubby looked and her freaked!.......He ran out of the house to get bandages and told me to sit still and not move!.....I was bleeding like a stuck pig!......We got the bleeding stopped (It was late Friday so go figure no doc available)....But we got it under control and all was well after that.....I laughed about it...I thought it was funny bt not my hubby...He thought I was bleeding to death!...LOL     ",

First off, Nana sends many many hearfelt thanks to all you wonderful ladies here at BCO.......She said she would come herself but it really upsets her coming here......She asked that I convey her love and thanks to you all for all the prayers and well wishes for Our Little Swet Pea, Hannah...... Secondly, we need more prayer for Hannah as she has yet another node removal surgery this Friday at 1:15 pm Pacific Time.......The doctor is removing a total of 10 to 12 more nodes on Friday......If you don't have the address to send well wishes just PM me and I will gladly share......Just remember Hannah has a 2 yr old brother JJ and he likes Thomas the Train........We need to keep him in the loop too so he doesn't feel left out.......Hannah is so PO'd that she has to stay out of school YET AGAIN!.....She was all stoked this morning though and excited to tell all her friends about her trip to New York and meeting Robin from the GMA show!........Also her Nana and mother finally got a full diagnosis for Hannah...She is battling triple neg bc!.......The show called them a couple of days before the interview and asked them to find out so they could announce it on the show instead of just saying Hannah had bc...They wanted to know wha type.....Needless to say it devastated her Nana and her parents but Hannah is a fighter and I truly believe she will beat the odds.....I pray she will one day be that 100 yr old bc survivor like she met in California last week!........ Edited to add: Hannah is now NED!...She has No Evidnce of Disease!!!..YAHOOOO!!!!!!.",

Hannah went in a few days ago to have the drain removed and the pathology report was in earlier than expected\u2026.. All 11 nodes removed were clean!!! WHAT A RELIEF! So now, we can all get back to a normal life. It will be a while for a full recovery and for Hannah to get back on the softball field. We just wanted to let everyone know the good news as we are so relieved to finally see a light at the end of the tunnel. This is such WONDERFUL news!...Thank you, Sweet Jesus, for an answer to our prayers!......",

She has been running around saying how excited she is that she does not have to carry those darned bags around. We even went on a walk with JJ this evening. She still has to wait until Monday to take a shower. I think she is probably looking more forward to that than anything, I know I would be after a week and a half of sponge baths. Today was also the first time she got a good look at the incision. She was and is a little upset at what she saw. We don\u2019t think she knew entirely what it would look like and neither did we for that matter. We sat down with her and had a little talk and explained that she will have reconstructive surgery later on (she calls it recreational surgery). We all knew it would take some getting used to after the initial shock. It doesn\u2019t look nearly as bad as she thinks it does but it is a signifigant change to her body. And we will let her react any way she wants to. We\u2019re sure this will be the first of many not so great days. The support from everybody here is the one, if not the reason we all haven\u2019t gone crazy. Thank you all for your continued support and prayers. J & C",

Updated to add correct name of company that does Oncotype DX testing.......... Their website is www.Genomichealth.com",

Because of my family history I elected to do a bilat mast...And because I had enough stomach fat I did an immediate TRAM reconstruction on both breasts...It was an 8 1/2 to 9 1/2 hour surgery but well worth it..I was in the hospital for 4 days....2 more than required because of fever........I was out of work for 2 months...........",
