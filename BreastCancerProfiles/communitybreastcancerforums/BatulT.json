How many people felt like me? ) When I got diagnosed, so many people prayed for me and asked about my health. I didn't even know some of the people asking about me. One day, I started to think what makes me so special? Why are so many people are concerned about me? But I haven't achieved anything neither am I so benevolent, then why? Then, I realized that beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder. The people who have asked about me are the ones who are really great because they are gifted with compassion. Thank you each and everyone of you. You lifted my mood when I was down. Your concern for me made me want to fight just that much harder. Compassion provides solace to a troubled soul. Like if this post made you smile and keep sharing. By Batul Kutub Batul Log in to post a reply",
