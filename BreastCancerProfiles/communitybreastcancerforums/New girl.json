Do yall think the front closure will hurt since a lot of my radiation from what I gather will be concentrated near the sternum? I go for mapping on 5/12 and will start I guess the next week for 6.5 weeks. Very nervous as my skin is very sensitive. Having more trouble dealing with this than any other stuff so far.",

I go downstairs to what I call the dungeon.  No cell service.  I go into the ladies dressing room where two curtains are stocked with nice folded cotton gowns.  Breast cancer patients close in front, others I have noticed close in back.  Larger sizes are in the closet.  Once you have undressed and put your belongings in a bag they give you the first day, you wait in the room until your name is called.  No drinks or food is allowed in here and there is nothing to read and no tv so we all talk everyday.  We are allowed to keep our shoes on and there are 9 treatments rooms.  There is a monitor that tells you what rooms are running behind and which ones are on schedule.  We always have the same treatment room.  When we are called, we are escorted down the hall to our treatment room.  We give our birthday and they have a picture of us on the monitor.  We go into the room and leave our purses and clothes bag on the chair.  A soft sheet is on the table and most of the time there is no music or above table tv.  Sometimes there is so I am not sure who decides what to have on each day.  Every 6 days we have xrays along with treatment.  Normal day takes about 8 minutes once in the treatment room.  After we are done we go back to the changing room and throw our cotton gown into the dirty laundry bag. Before treatment started I was given a nice folder with a DVD and sheets telling me what to expect.  It had on it the three tech I would have everyday.  Since that time almost 4 weeks ago, each day has been new techs.  Somedays this is no big deal but there is one tech who takes very little time adjusting me and we get in and out very fast.  Today I had all new people who could not get the adjustments correct.  Finally they did but my arms were badly contorted and sore when I left.  Hope my favorite tech is back tomorrow.  Anyone else deal with musical techs everyday? Doctor visits are very inconsistent too.  My doctor barely is in the room before she shoots out.  Never has looked under my arm.  Last week she was gone so I had the one everyone seems to adore.  She examined me and looked at my back, underarm and forearm.  Sat in the room and answered questions.  Wow what a difference.  So again more inconsistencies.  Curious if the Canadian experience is as different as the amount of treatments they give.  Curious also about the shoe thing.  Cleanliness?  And definitely happy to get the cotton gowns. ",

So far other than getting me started, I am not impressed with the long waits for the appointments just so she can say everything is fine. ",

She recommends a 2nd mastectomy to remove my DIEP flaps and more breast tissue. I am ticked, mad and frustrated. I had no idea I should have asked to see how much breast tissue was left behind after surgery. BTW, the new MRI I had done in 2016 showed it clearly. Pretty scary stuff when I saw all the tissue with calcifications that matched my mammograms in 2012. Now I realize I should have been doing mammograms every year.

I was shocked when my choices to survive depended on allowing them to be removed. Not a simple mastectomy but a radical disforming one.  I am a hoarder at heart and didn't want to get rid of them.  I hated people who tried to make me feel better by glib stupid remarks.  It wasn't like losing my uterus that I no longer needed or wanted.  I would have gladly traded that for my breasts.  I was losing an essential part of my outward apperance and more importantly my love life.  I feel robbed that I didn't get an upgrade.  Although I am told that my PS did an incredible job,but I am left with   two bloobs of uneven flesh thrown on my chest like a slabs of brisket.  Warm to the touch yet missing that incredible sensation of a nipple.  Hideous discs that will somehow be made into nipples that will never become erect on their own or allow me to feel pure pleasure from my husband's touch.  I miss them terribly and hate this disease.  I hate that my husband cannot look at me without getting embarrassed that he is turned off by my apperance.  I miss our lovemaking and worry that we will never recover from this transition from eager lover to wounded mate.  I hope that someday a cure can be found that allows us to keep our breasts. Allows us to deal with this disease without also dealing with our new body.  I miss them and wish I had another choice that would have allowed me to keep them.",

Had surgery at NOLA this past December and had to pull my own drains out after a few weeks.  I was talked through the entire procedure and it didn't hurt a bit.  So I think if you stay on top of your pain, and the doctor does it slowly, it should not hurt even a tiny bit.  I think my first drain caught a stitch and pulled and that is what hurt so bad.  They do not stitch up the hole just put a gauze over it.  The only bad scar I have is from the first drain that was pulled.

I was four months into treatment when I just felt so sad.  I have never had much patience with depressed people .  I always have tried to put things into perspective and find joy in all things.  Cancer completely threw that out the window.  I worried about my 13 year old all the time.  Worried that my depression would scar her forever.  I absolutely had rage towards my ob/gyn who blew me off a year ago when I went in with a inverted nipple.  I felt lonely and abandoned by my husband who couldn't handle my range of emotions.  I found this site and started finding strength in women who were traveling this road with me.  I got into a great support group that let me vent without judging me.  I got a prescription for Valium in case I started crashing into despair.  I only have had to take it once in two months but I like knowing it is there.  I have started to regain my joy for living.  Seeing the positives that have come from all of this.  YES there are some positives from this nightmare.  Start focusing on the good things that are in your life.  But don't beat yourself up when you cannot be strong.  Many hugs.",
