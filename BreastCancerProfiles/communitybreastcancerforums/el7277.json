Listening to my body is something I am taking very seriously and that guides my decisions. I have had only one TCH treatment so far followed by 2 weeks Herceptin alone. TCH again thisThurs. The first round affected my digestive system so badly that I lost a week and sleeping was a nightmare. Herceptin leaves my with headaches 2 days after and the fatigue is something with me often. After speaking with my boss and HR I will be usining unpaid intermittent leave for work (12 weeks to be used as needed). My benefits will remain but I will not be paid on my days off for this battle. It seems best for my situation and my company is all about supporting me through this and have offered to allow me to work from home when I choose. I have port placement tomorrow and have already decided I will not work Thurs and Fri this week. I feel I rushed back after the first time and it worked against me. Good luck with your decision...we all need to do what is right for ourselves.",
