I don't know why it is so difficult to find the answers through the medical professionals I deal with. My surgeon acted like I was using language (i.e., grade) that is used only on this site. Obviously it is used on the American Cancer Society's site and elsewhere and not just here.  Thanks again.",

My BS had a PS close up and hopefully I will have a thin line for scars. But only time will tell. One side is perfect but the other got kind of bunched up (not flat) so it is and will look very bad.

My ONC when talking about blood draws says, \"ya gotta do what ya gotta do\" so I get them on my left side (I am right handed). Also, my PCP insists (!) on taking my BP on my arm so I get it on my left side. When my BP is taken on my calf, the reading is always higher. So I personally am also concerned with high BP and want to know what it truly is. It seems useless to take BP on calf! I ask them to wait until I've been off my feet but they don't listen.",

It shouldn't be the doctor's decision! It's your mother's body!

Although I have yet to see an onco, and although I'm thinking there is no cure, I do really feel somewhat hopeful after having gone through this thread. At the same time, I get the idea that it ain't over yet. But I MUST take a vacation away from all of this and just do something that I wouldn't ordinarily do (no I won't go rob a bank lol). A friend of mine and I are going to this nature sactuary near where we live tomorrow. It's gotten cool here in Houston and it is just wonderful. I'm also working on how I think and how denial can be a good thing if one remains smart about it (like saying I'm cancer free yet still go see my onco, smart like that). My head might say one thing, but I will allow my heart to say another which hopefully will influence my head. Something like that anyways. And perhaps taking that approach I'll be okay. But I really like my new role of Valkyrie Warrior Goddess!!!! LOL",

I opted no reconstruction because it would entail more dr visits and possibly more surgeries to fix potential problems thus the copays. I have limited funds. I didn't know it at the time but I did need a PS in the beginning because of the dog ears. Now I need more surgery to fix this, thus more dr visits thus the hospital copay. I am scheduled for surgery on Mar 3rd for this revision. Oh well, PS it is. Not reconstruction btw. Reconstruction is a personal thing.

I value every single post and have been listening intently. But now, it is obvious to me that there is no cure for breast cancer. I'm just being real with myself in saying this. There's no way for me to know for myself that I won't have a recurrence. But it looks good for me that I will not. It saddens me to know it won't be the case for other sisters here. I will be hypervigilant with my cancer. After all, I could still have a recurrence if I am not mindful of it. And I will add a healthy dose of denial. Why? A social worker once told me \"denial is okay\" In other words, she was telling me to think that planes don't fly into buildings. It was a way of denying something I couldn't change, thus eliminating some of the anxiety that went with it. I will try and live my life without the fear of recurrence, and shoot for NED. That's all I can do. I don't know what more I can do. Since my dx on 7/21/2010, I started wearing this pink band that said, \"say it - fight it - cure it\". Wearing it in the beginning helped a LOT. But now, not so much. I took it off today. I need no reminders that I have cancer. Be mindful of it? Yes. Daily reminders? No.",

Unfortunately it doesn't stop bleeding as easily like when you prick your finger so I use one of those small circular clear bandaids for the spot I poked. I do this on my thigh which seems more convenient as I don't want bandaids to be seen on my calves. I'd get a port for the chemo. I hear the power port is good for everything like chemo, rads, and drawing blood. Ask your doctor about that. Good luck. Mindy :)",

I did try and take a lancet (without any device) and poke myself multiple times in the same site but gosh, that's horrible! I'm thinking my toes. Haven't tried that yet. When I asked my GP about alternate sites, he wants to see me to see my arms??? Asked the nurse why, because I can't use my arms!! Golly gee wiz, it sounds so simple.

They had me arrive two hours early (time stood still) and obviously no coffee before surgery. After surgery I was dying for a caffeine fix. I was walking the halls that evening in the hospital and couldn't sleep. The bed was too high to get in and out of. The PS closed me up and glued me shut. I had this burning sensation where my breasts were. There will be numbness and you will lose range of motion. My range of motion is pretty much improved but not at 100%, and I still have some numbness in places. I had four drains. Not sure if you know about these. The drains capture the fluid that builds up after surgery. You're supposed to empty the drains at regular intervals for a few days. They are a pain but time goes by quickly. I experienced a loss after losing my breasts. Surgeons must either be loved (no cancer!) or hated (no breasts!). I think my surgeon is afraid of me lol. Check out the surgery forum. There is a thread about a shopping list and how to prepare. I would have been lost without that thread. And also in that forum, there's usually a thread dedicated for each month for women who are having surgery in the respective month. You'll find many friends and support there. It's doable. You'll be okay!  Mindy xxx",

And I don't have a support system to help me through this; so in addition to fighting cancer, I must handle the financial end of things. I was told at my clinic that the only financial assistance people can get is for chemo. So I thought if I did chemo, then I could get assistance. Pretty dramatic idea I know, but I am at my wit's end. Seems easier to just give up.",

Let's say you had a MX and the margins are dirty then you'd need chemo anyway and are expected to be cured (I think). So do women ever decide on keeping their breast? I'm seriously considering it.

      "Content": "Aug 19, 2010 02:02PM - edited Aug 19, 2010 02:07PM by Halah I have decided to go ahead with the surgery. I saw a medical oncologist and the only option at this point is surgery. It was such a difficult thing to accept! A lumpectomy is not an option. So since I am a DD, I'm getting a BMX. Being big busted makes it difficult to keep one and attempt to look normal with either implants later or breast forms. In my mind, it's both or nothing. Also saw a social worker in the infusion department and she was a tremendous help as well. The onco said I would at least be treated with tamoxofen or the generic of arimidex for up to 5 years after surgery (I don't have to pay for generics). My psychopathic father said he'd pay my bills for me and I am checking it out every day to see if the clinic received the payment. I hate that I have to ask him for help because he is so mean (there's a history there). But if I can just get through this surgery then perhaps everything will be okay.",

It didn't hurt when that happened but it really made a mess. (The stuff really smells and is gross.) So now I have this sloshing that I hear on the left side where the drains were. Not sure if the surgeon will aspirate the fluid or not. Today is 16 days out and I still have the two drains on my right side. I'm still putting out 20cc more or less so I think I am ready! I see my surgeon on Friday. If he wants to leave them in any longer, the answer is NO!! It's my body so it's up to me AFAIC. Anyways, I think it will be more freeing without the drains; you're limited with them being there. They get in the way, are annoying, etc. One thing that helps me: get a lanyard. I use that when I change tops or bathe. You'll need something to attach the bulbs to when you're not wearing anything. I also use the lanyard when I go to the doc which makes it easier for the examination.",

Whether or not you do reconstruction at the same time of the MX is a personal decision. I will have  a BMX and opted for no recon at this time because if i need radiation afterwards, it could have negative effects on implants. I'd hate to have to need even more surgery! But who knows, I just might remain breast free and get breast forms and still look girly. It's a personal thing. I'm getting a BMX because I am DD and they don't make implants or breast forms that size from what I've read. I also don't want to risk the chance of recurrence. But good luck to you! It always works out in the end! You'll get through this.",
