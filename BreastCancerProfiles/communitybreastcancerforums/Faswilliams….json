      "Content": "Faswilliams wrote: My 82 year old double mastectomy MIL was diagnoised in March 2010. She is like my mother. I acompany her to all her appointments and make sure she is getting everything she needs. It hurts us to see her in pain. Her last mastectomy was in 2001. She was faithful with her regular visits to her oncologist with no indication that her cancer had even returned much less progressed to this stage.  Cancer is all over her body in her bones.  She had received 15 radiation treatments and well as Zometa infusion treatments.  She is currently on Fentanly patch for pain management.  Over the past 6 months, she has began to experience headaches accompanying dizziness as well as her ankle swelling with pain and turning dark in color.  Her Oncologist or PC Dr. have not been able to tell us what might be causing these new issues.  Her BP & BS are excellent. Her diet of no salt/sugar under control and drinks plenty of fluids. She has been taken to the ER 3 times over the past 15 weeks---pain in leg and head with dizziness. Doppler studies show no blockage. MRI of the brain reveals 2 small left extra-axial anterior masses as well as a small right parietal scalp nodule. CT scan also reveals 1 L & 1 R pulmonary nodule as well as 2 visible lung nodules in the R & L lobes as well as L hilar lymph node measuring 2.4 cm x 2.1 cm transversely.  Now this if all very foreign to us. Can someone please help us figure out her status? Has the loveone of another caregiver experienced these symptoms? Is this a normal progression of her disease?  Please help!!! We are desperate to help ease her discomfort and concerns. My husband is an only child. Dx 3/9/2010, 2cm, Stage IV, Grade 3, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

Can anyone suggest any special questions I should be asking her onco.  Thanks.  We continue to remain encouraged.",
