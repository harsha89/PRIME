Been awhile since I visited the board.  At last post I was going to a breast cancer weekend retreat.  I had a great time, although I was in terrible pain on Saturday.  When the pain gets that bad I use an ice pack, kinda numbs it for awhile.   I was surprised that none of the women at the retreat had experienced the kind of pain we have. I've been going to physical therapy for a couple of weeks now. Sometimes I think its helping, other times seems to make it worse.  I wish I could figure out why some days better and other days worse.  I am suppose to go see a different pain management doc in about 2 weeks, although I am not hopeful about the appointment.  I also take Neurontin daily.  I have also emailed Dr. Oz and Oprah but never heard back from them. Oh well, I need to go stretch and then off to bed.  My physical therapist says that to stretch the fascia I need to hold the stretches for 60-90 seconds, that is a long time, I had to buy a small times because I wasn't holding the stretches long enough.  Take care!",

I went to see new pain specialist today, Dr. Reasor. He was the first doctor that acknowledged my pain.  I was prepared with multiple articles about post mastectomy pain syndrome.  Before I even showed them to him, he said I think you have PMPS.  He is recommending Spinal Cord Stimulation.  SCS uses a small implanted system, similiar to a pacemaker. It generates tiny electrical pulses that are sent to your spinal cord.  These electrical pulses block pain signals before they arrive at the brain, replacing them with a tingling or massaging sensation. SCS is not a cure for pain.  It's a therapy that can help reduce your pain to a manageable level without the side effects of drugs ( which like many of you have found have side effects and are not very effective). The scary part is that it is \"implanted\" into your spinal cord.  The company is ANS (Advanced Neuromodulation Systems), a St. Jude Medical Company.  The have a website poweroveryourpain.com.  I am suppose to meet with a representative from the company before the procedure.  They initially implant an temporary device and test it for several days/weeks to see if it is going to work, it is called a trial.  If you do get relief then a permanent implant is put in. Has anyone tried this before? Have any of your pain specialists mentioned this therapy? It seems pretty aggressive and a little scary. It is used for other chronic pain conditions besides PMPS.

The article did not give any treatment options for women suffering from this condition :( Robin, I'm glad you are not experiencing PMPS.  Most women I talk to don't really know what we are feeling.  I appreciate your caring.  You are going to love, love, love the retreat and Pam and the gals.  Best weekend I've had in forever despite the terrible pain I was in.  I can't believe we were at the same fashion show and didn't know it.  Do you live/work in New Albany?  Keep in touch. Pain is very bad tonight.  Have to work tomorrow at 6:30 a.m. so off to bed for me.  Thank goodness for the Ambein.  Take care everyone. ",

I've never liked doctors and this experience has made that even worse.  I've been taking Neurotin for about 9 months. Not much relief but am afraid to stop taking it.  Ultram is contraindicated because of the Remeron I've been on for many years.  I hate the idea of taking meds.  Its like thowing darts in the dark. Then someone finds the right doctor and the right drug/treatment combination and gets relief.  It makes you want to keep trying but it is discouraging.  Physical therapy doesn't seem to be working but therapist says it could take a long time to see effect.   This is the only place I've found with ladies that understand what it is like to try and function with terrible pain every day.  People look at me and think she can't be in as much pain as she says, but what I am suppose to do...if I went out looking as bad as I feel...well lets just say it would be scary!!  Oh well, take care y'all, it is off to bed for me. PT tomorrow morning.  I am going to a breast cancer survivor fashion show on Thurs. and have the breast cancer retreat renuion on Sat. Looking forward to these fun events!    Jean ",
