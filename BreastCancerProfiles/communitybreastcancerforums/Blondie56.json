I had a mastectomy, reconstruction, 12 chemo treatments consisting of Methotrexate, FIU and 5 years of scans and Tamaxofen. I was cancer free for almost 13 years, and low and behold I got Stage 4 cancer in the lining of my lung last December. Of course, I was devastated got a second opinion and I am being treated with Arimidex and Zometa, since they can't operate on my tumors and they found some bone mets. I am doing well, going monthly for treatments of Zometa and every three months for scans. Just when you think you are finally safe, this disease rears its ugly head. I just wanted to share with you all and hopefully make some new friends. God Bless and be well. Blondie56 Log in to post a reply",
