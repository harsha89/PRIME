I still haven't figured if max strength pepcid or prilosec is better - anyone find that one is better than the other? Well - I am here at work - going to try to muddle through at least 6 hours here.  I hope those of you who have had treatments are doing OK - we are all one step closer to done with this part - yay! Oh - and yes - I am plaqued by acne - head and scalp!  Yes - a brutal combo - no hair and acne.  its a real bummer on top of everything else. Mia",

Anyhow - it is good to be done with the AC.  We will all be done with this chemo soon - when you look at the big picture.    It's always nice to pop in here to see what everyone is going through and for some encouragement and suppport.

You can always find someone here to give you some first hand advice about whatever side effect or fear or whatever you may have.  Start drinking lots of water now! I know that might be difficult given the long drive - but I think drinking alot before and in the 4 days following chemo helped me alot!  I feel strange giving advice since I have only had one chemo...I'm no expert -  but it sounds like you need some encouragement... After tomorrow you will be that much closer to having all of this behind you - hang in there.  And try to get a good nights sleep?  I now that one is a tall order! Take care and cyber hug- M",

I am day 8 post chemo... have horrendous backache!  Don't know if it is chemo related - could be work related or sleep related??  anyone else ever have this?  I wonder if it is from the neulasta... I took claritin for 7 days - stopped today. A couple of you were asking about new liquid alternatives.  I got so sick of water and gatorade.  What is working for me great these days is half apple juice half hot water - comes out lukewarm.  I am sure I will get sick of this too eventually - but you may want to try it.  I bought some \"ginger drink powder\" that someone at work recommended - I didn't like it but apparently some people find it nice AND it can help with nausea. I think it is interesting that some of us have had the same surprise re nausea.  I have also always been way too easy to vomit.  Puked through both of my pregnancies - from before I knew I was pregnant until I was in labor.  With baby two puked for days after.  Car sick - always.  Sea sick - can't get on a boat. I can't tell you the number of times in my life I've had to go to ER for fluids for relatively trivial things (little food poisoning, little stomach bug)   I warned them about this for surgery - and for chemo.  BUT - I have been so shocked - they must have thought I was lying!  No nausea with surgery - had the little ear patch and I don't know what else.  NO nausea yet with chemo - I took those anti-nausea meds religiously on schedule - I don't know if that was what made me OK for the first treatment or not - but I am not gonna risk it - doing the same thing next week.  Only some indigestion/reflux so I took pepsid.  I really hope I am not jinxing myself saying this - but I am hearing the same thing from some of you here it sounds...  So - though this may not be much comfort to those of you who are feeling so sick (very sorry... my heart so goes out to you) - maybe it will take away some of the fear for those of you who have your first treatment coming up.   I really have to check out these buff things!  I am way behind the times for my age - these things sound great!   My new routine is to catch up on this thread every night when I get home from work - while the kids are having their hour (sometimes more - oops) of TV and hubby does the dishes..  You are all incredibly strong and inspirational women.  Well - I send good vibes and well wishes to all of you tonight.   M",

I am having a horrible time finding my \"thing\" for my hair.  Wore a scarf to work Tuesday and ended up balling in the bathroom because it wasn't right - like as much as when I got diagnosis (yes - misplaced emotion - hair and scarves not really that big a deal).  My expensive wig hurts my ears, and my cheaper one got wet in the snow, I washed it - now it isn't as pretty.  I don't know what I'm gonna do about this.  I feel compelled to wear wig in meetings at work - and to certain places - but I rip it off every chance  Iget.  Gonna be a long struggle on that for me. Please let me know how you ladies into treatment 2 are doing.  I am nervous though I did well last time.  I am so sorry for all of you have the bad side effects.  I am just doing what I did last time - staying \"ahead\" of things with the anti-nausea, antacids, and stool softeners.  I can't believe how many pills I take a day - but it worked last time so I'll do it again... Hope everyone is managing well - you are all so strong and inspirtational.  I am glad I was able to come back and read the posts - it brings me strength and hope. Take care- M",

It is all overwhelming - I know... mine all happened so fast - mamm oct 15, biopsy oct 17, dx oct 18, dbl mx w/ TE Nov 1 and here I am with first chemo dec 5.  Sounds like my tumor bigger than yours,it is grade III and I consider it nearly TN since ER was only barely positive.  That is why I am taking the most aggressive treatment they offer me.  And no one has tried to talk me out of that yet.... It's good that you were able to get in with 3 oncologist - I just went with what I had since I didn't want to slow anything down.  And I am happy with my aggressive oncologist.  I'm no doctor - but in my opinion the TN, high grade, and your age would make you want to do the most aggressive treatment you can.  I am 46 - my doctor pointed out that\"young\" women like me (was happy to be called young) tolerate this treatment fairly well - that its long and hard - but its doable and the results are good.  I know they are only statistics - but I am for any improvement in my stats no matter how small. Good luck!  I think its time for an ativan or something and bed for me... very nervous about what tomorrow will bring. YOu can private message me if you have specific questions and I am only a few days ahead of you I think.  I am new to all of this - breast cancer and this forum! Hang in there. M",

Unradiated side perfect - healed no problem.  After about a week - a big red area formed around the incision - and it began to split apart.  Was same location and area of the radiation boost.  Dr. was worried it was infection - so in hospital for IV antibiotics for 3 days.  No change.  Decided it was \"radiation recall\".  I stopped taking my letrizole - thought it might be the cause.  I had to have a second procedure to cut the ragged edges and re-sew.  There is still a hole.. big, black ugly looking but not oozing - it's dry - and it doesn't hurt.  Playing it day by day now - going to PS for a look every week.  PS says it's not dangerous - but they may eventually have to take it out.  I am not ready to give up yet! Anyone have anything like this??  My PS says to try to keep it dry - not to put antibiotic ointment on it - but I have read on some boards that ointment helps???  Any advice on this radiation recall or anyone with a similar experience - I would appreciate it!

Annette - I was told that radiation recall can also occur from other medications - like taoxifen and letrozole - not only from the hard chemo.  I am still not sure that mine was radiation recall - it may have just radiation damage - dead skin with poor vasularization that wouldn't heal.  How are you doing now?  Is it getting any worse? Are the antibiotics helping?  When I first got the \"radiation recall\" or whatever it was - they admitted me to hospital for 3 days for IV antibiotics.  IT did not change a bit - that is how they concluded it wasn't an infection but was radiation damage.  Ugh - I am so sorry for you.  I know that is a scarey thing to watch... and not knowing WHAT it is makes it worse. So - for an update - my PS sat me down last week and said enough was enough - she was pretty sure that it was implant right under the big black scab.  I was given the choice of removal - or lat flap.  I very reluctantly went for the lat flap... had it Tuesday.  So far so good - but I am only 3 days out.  My back is quite sore... I don't know what you women do who have the lat flap on both sides - must be terribly difficult to ever get comfortable.  She removed all of the area that had the radiation boost - an oval about 6 x 3 inches.  PS said that indeed - when she got in there - it was implant directly under the scab: no new skin or anything that would suggest it could ever heal.  Well, thanks for sharing your experiences with me.  I do hope this flap \"takes\" and that this is it for me for awhile... we will see.

I am so happy to hear that \"life is good\" for so many of you!  We did this - you are all such strong women.  My doc and I decided I should have a hysterectomy - so I am going to FORCE myself to go ahead and schedule this - or else I might just get back to \"normal\" and blow it off...  but I think after the past year that surgery will be a breeze. Best wishes ladies - I was so happy to read over the past few months of posts - it gave me a great sense of accomplishment and reminded me of what great support I have had from this board. M",

Another bit of weird news... my ER receptor status... keeps changing.  Biopsy - slighly positive, surgery - negative.  Now they have taken some of the frozen tumor and found something \"interesting\" - there are clumps of cells where greater than 50% of cells stain low to mod - but overall these are less than 1%.  Not sure if this is technically triple negative or not.  Anyhow - will take tamoxifen. Another curve ball... radiation.  I guess I am in the gray zone on this so my MO wants me to see a second RO.  Sounds like kiwikid in a similar dilemma??  Now I have to decide on radiation?  I am guessing it will do a number on these already poorly healing tissue expanders...  but if it gives me a few % improvement in 10 year survival - I'll do it. Ugh.. I just feel like I am in alot of \"gray areas\" - triple negative or not?  radiation or not?  There just doesn't seem to be much data on the \"in between\" cases.  Any advice, experience, or anything would be much appreciated!
