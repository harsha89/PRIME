So BS was happy, but sent me MO because I had 3 tumors in left breast. After all my initial testing and scans at onc office, it showed that mine didn't go through my nodes, but via the bloodstream and was already in several bones. So, my advice would be to do chemo to knock out any chance of trace cells. I found chemo was yucky with lots of SE's, but manageable. It's only for a few months and you can look back and say \"I did it, its over\". And maybe enjoy life with a little more peace of mind Just my take on things, but we are all different and handle this road differently. And that's ok. Take care, Jenny",
