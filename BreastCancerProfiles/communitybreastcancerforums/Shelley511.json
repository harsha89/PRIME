I had to ask them to inject more. I finally made them take the needle out. They still needed to get a little more tissue. So they went in one more time. The radiologist said that it is very rare that the lidocaine doesn't work. My luck!! Mine turned out to be DCIS. Had lumpectomy Please keep us posted. Shelley",
