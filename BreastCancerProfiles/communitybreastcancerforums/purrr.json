I'm not sure if its right place to ask such a question... forgive me if I made a mistake :) Problem is, medicine in our country is not super reliable, so it's better to double-check treatments offered by doctors. Also there is a problem of corruption resulting in inadequate treatments. So I try to collect as much information as possible. My mother (53 y.o.) was diagnosed with breast cancer on 29-Jan-2016. Preliminary diagnosis: T2N2M0 or T1N1M0 (different opinions - because of biopsy taken from tumor, the tumor has grown twice its size during a week - so you see, already no clear opinion. also some say there is one node affected, others say its conglomerate with more than one node). I'd be grateful for any opinions of proposed treatment strategy! Especially, about neoadjuvant therapy.Tumor has been found in the right breast with a size of 1.2cm, lymph node next to it (arm pit area) is oversized (3cm) and the opposite node is also slightly big (2cm). Biopsy detected invasive ductal carcinoma, with lymph node affected by metastasis. First IHC: ER: +, PR: +, HER2: 2+, Ki67: 50%; G2 (2+3+1) Second IHC (revised, with FISH): ER: + (95%, 8 ball), PR: + (80%, 8 ball), Ki67: 60%, Elston&Ellis: (2+2+2)=6 FISH: negative (no amplification of her2/new, for 20 cores of tumor cells: chromosome 17: 25 signals, her2: 50 signals, rate: 1.42) As for other tests: - mammography: didn't detect tumor itself, but detected lymph node problem - ultrasound: detected tumor and possible metastasis in lymph node (further biopsy confirmed that on right side nodes are grouped in conglomerate, 1 or 2 nodes affected with metastasis) - osteo scintigraphy: ok (there were some suspicious places on ribs near the breast side, on shoulder, at the back of skull, but repeated scintigraphy and x-ray didn't show anything bad) - CT scan (with contrast): same as ultrasound, detected tumor and lymph nodes - blood tests: ok - BRCA: one mutation detected (BRCA1 5382insC, others were negative: BRCA1 2080delA(insA), BRCA2 6174delT, BRCA1 4153delA, BRCA1 185delAG, BRCA1 3875del4, BRCA1 3819del5, BRCA1 T300G) what treatment plan is recommended in this case? - what kind of neoadjuvant therapy? chemo/hormones? - what kind of surgery? - what kind of adjuvant therapy? chemo/hormones? if neoadjuvant chemo fails, what would be plan B for neoadjuvant period? Next week my Mom is scheduled to have first chemo, some kind of platinum. as I understand BRCA-1 mutation was the primary cause of this decision. Do you think its right type of chemo? some say platinum is hard chemo, what can we do to make it less aggressive for health? any special meals? any other practical advice? thanks in advance!

While I realize that there might be no doctors here, often times patients know very much especially if they had similar diagnosis. kayb, thank you for these links! as for tests and scans, not all of them were proposed by doctors, I had to read some info over the internet, and for example, we did some scans which doctors said \"optional\", and specifically BRCA test was almost overlooked, and should we not ask, it won't be done... but once BRCA-1 mutation was discovered it has changed treatment type. in the end, they suggested platinum therapy, as I expected after reading some studies, but I wanted any kind of third opinion... for example, I wasn't sure if platinum alone is ok, maybe somebody got some additional treatment at the same time in similar case. also, I wasn't sure if its common practice in other countries, or just some experiments. BarredOwl. thanks for your answer! initially the tumor was more like T1N1M0 (judging by ultrasound scan), but after biopsy the tumor has grown twice its size over the week or so. So some doctors said it has become T2, while current ultasound (after 2 weeks) says that tumor's core hasn't changed, and the growth is just some side effect from biopsy. current CT doesn't clarify things. As for nodes, different doctors say different things even now, some say its conglomerate of nodes, with 1 of them affected by metastasis, some say more than 2, thus N2. As for drug names, it seems we will know better near the day of chemo. there is some kind of organization mess in the clinic these days... thanks for the tips about endocrine therapy and genetic counseling! I'll try to collect more info about that. thanks again for your kind words and support!",
