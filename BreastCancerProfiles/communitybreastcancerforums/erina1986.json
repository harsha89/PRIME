I find it so interesting that when you actually look at the studies there is very little research supporting complications from needle sticks. (In this article not only do they talk about needle sticks, they talk about hand surgeries, the myth about elevation of arm and compression of arm. I was scared to death about getting a blood draw on the effected arm because they couldn't get any veins else where. Turns out its actually not that big of a deal, the only real complication is a slight increased risk of infections. Seems that it was a myth that was propagated through medical schools.",
