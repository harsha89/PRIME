So far the pain isn't bad at all.  I have not had to take any of my pain meds.  I think I will take one tonight before bed so I can sleep. Want to wish all the ladies with upcoming surgery lots of luck and little pain.  All the ladies that have already been through surgery, I hope you are all doing well too. Talk to you soon. HUGS!!  And big ones at that!!",

So, now what?  I'm as confused as ever.  By the way, they will be mailing all my stuff that I asked for.  I really liked this office and the atmosphere.  That helps a bunch, huh? Ladies what did you choose and why?",

Is there anything I need to plan for that day?  I am planning on leaving my dentures at home.  I have an upper set and I don't have to have them and I don't want to have to keep up with them all day.  I am also planning on leaving my jewerly (earrings, watch) at home so I don't have that hastle either.  I plan to wear a pair of comfortable shorts, big shirt and sports bra.  If you can think of any thing that was helpful for you, please let me know.

I am adopted and that makes any kind of medical history even harder....I don't know mine.  Right now I'm just trying to take it one day at a time and enjoy my kids and grandkids.  I know BC is not an automatic death sentence anymore, but it is scarey.  I am a strong woman with a good support group.  I have had several employees get BC and they are still alive today.  So I know it can be treated successfully. I will post more information after I talk with my onc dr. on Monday.  Thanks for letting me join the club that no one wants to join.  I look forward to learning lots of things about bc.  My biggest concern right now is that the cancer has spread to my lungs.  Unfortunately, I do smoke and have for at least 34 years.  Not good, I know.  I am going to try to smoke my e-cig more and hopefully I will be able to quit regular cigs.

I have a follow-up appointment with my doctor on Tuesday and I'm sure we will discuss my treatment plan and where I go from here.  And I hope he takes this damned drain tube out!  Ugh!  That's been the worst part of this whole ordeal!!!

My biopsy was an US guided biopsy and I felt nothing but was awake and talking to the nurses and doctor.  It was a fairly quick procedure.  Two days later the doctor called with the results.  Since July 19, I have had a lumpectomy with SNs taken out.  You can see in my signature line my diagnosis.  I have now had my second chemo treatment and I am doing farily well.

Hope everyone is doing well. HUGS!",

I have managed to get 2 weeks (10 treatments) under my belt and now my breast is sore and I feel achy all over.  Really get stiff if I sit a long time and kinda hard to get going again.  I'm going to blame it on the rads.  LOL!  I don't know what else it could be.  I do feel much better as far as SE's go.  Taste buds are returning and I find myself eating a lot right now.  Guess I'll be gaining back that 12 pounds I lost.  Oh, well!  Still have some swelling in my feet and legs.  I wonder when that will go away.  Maybe never huh? Hope everyone has a wonderful weekend. HUGS!",

I finished 3 weeks of 6 on Friday.  The last 3 weeks have kinda flown by and I'm hoping the next 3 will fly too. I also work in the education field, but on the transportation side.  Running buses up and down the road every day is stressful too so I can relate to those who are teachers out there going through this stuff.  I agree with Anafoefana in that this part is not so bad after surgery and chemo.  I think chemo has been by far the worse for me so far.  It just seemed like the more treatments I had the SE's got worse.  So far the only bad thing about rads for me is the drive up there and back EVERY day.  It gets on my nerves to have to fight the traffic every day.  But this, too, shall pass.  And pretty soon it will all be over for us and we can find our new normal. Hope you all have a wonderful rest of the weekend.   Wishing everyone well next week as we begin the rads all over again. HUGS to each and everyone of you.  You all make going through this so much easier!  So glad to have the support here that we have.",

Lifechanging2011:  I was also diagnosed with high blood pressure.  I'm pretty sure my cancer did not cause mine.  When I went in to see my PCP about some anxiety meds, he put me on blood pressure meds too.  He told me that the last three or four times that I had been in (and there was lots of time in between visits) that my blood pressure was up and that we were going to have to do something about it before I started my journey down Breast Cancer Avenue.  He did and I can tell you I felt so much better after he did that.  I have not had a \"tension\" headache (which I got often) since he put me on the meds back in July.  My blood pressure is now normal and I am thankful that he did what he did.  But I don't know if the cancer itself can cause high blood pressure but I suspect the anxiety from the diagnosis certainly could!  And do pamper yourself this weekend. Just finished week #4!  Yippee!  Only 2 and 1/2 to go!  I have 13 treatments left and I just can't wait to be done already!  My breast is sore, red and swollen.  Not too bad, but bad enough that I am now noticing some pain.  I try to go braless around the house as much as possible but sometimes that even hurts!  (I'm a 38DD)  I'm still mulling over the idea of bringing out my sports bras.  I think they may be more comfortable.  I hope each and everyone has a wonderful weekend with very few SE's.  Talk to you soon. HUGS!",

Hope you all have a wonderful rest of the week! HUGS!",
