(Can someone tell me if this is what it looks like please.) a few days ago I started feeling a burning sensation on my left breast but not on my right one and that concerned me because it had never happened to me and it persisted throughout the whole night. I am really concerned about this and made an appointment with my primary care doctor. I am mostly concerned because cancer is you can say common in my family. I have no type of lumps in any of my breasts and have no pain most of the time only at normal times like during my time of the month. Anything anyone can tell me would be helpful, thanks!

I Will keep you guys updated, much love @marie398 My family history is my main concern honestly, I know most people don't get cancer but 2 of my grandparents have died of cancer and a cousin of my mom recently got diagnosed with breast cancer and I just finished my second college semester and I wouldn't want something like this to affect my future. Thank you so much I hope my issue isn't something serious as well @emjay76 yes they both have the exact same spots and I have been noticing one my breast is bigger than the other but didn't pay much attention to it because I read it is normal and yes my nipple looks the same and I have no type of discharge and yeah I feel like it's not normal because that burning sensation persisted through out the whole night and continued in the morning. And will let you know what happens, thank you! @alicki I hope you feel much better! And thanks will doÂ ",

I feel like I honestly got brushed off, like he felt nothing and just brushed it off. I told him about the burning sensation and he basically ignored it. a few days ago I felt it again and it was more intense, lasted longer and also my nipples feel scaly. so I made an appointment with another doctor since mines is on vacation and I'm going to ask her for a mammogram. I am really worried because cancer is common in my family and just yesterday my moms cousin had a double mastectomy.",
