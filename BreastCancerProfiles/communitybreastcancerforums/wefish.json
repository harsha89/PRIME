      "Content": "wefish wrote: Hi- I'm 48 and have gotten mammos fo the last 5 years. The last one showed asymetrical focal densities in both breasts so I was sent for additional images on 10/22. The results were: Left Breast: US imaging demonstrates a lobulated nodule at 9 o'clock approx 6.5 mm in dimension. No vascualrity. Images suggest could represent a lymph node, however, anechoic appearance at the larger portion of this nodule suggest a lobulated cyst. Right Breast: US imaging demonstrates a 4 x 2 mm anechoic focus in the retroareolar region suggestive of a dilated duct or small cyst. No suspicious mass identified. Impression: Probably benign. FU bilateral mammogram and rt breast US recommended in 6 months to confirm stability of the probable benign findings.Â  BI-RAD 3. What does all this mean? To keep from becoming a psych patient, I made an appointment with a general surgeon (no specialists in the area) here in town but for some reason, I am not satisfied with doing it here- thing is, Seattle is the closest \"real\" specialist and that is 900 miles away ( I live in SE AK)- tickets are $800 if I were to make an appointment next week. Should I do that or see what the local doc has to say? I\"m confused, scared, anxious- I could keep adding adjectives here but I think you all know what I\"m going through so there is no need. Help, advice, comfort- anything would help. Thanks, Heidi Log in to post a reply",

If I wait until the first weekend in December the tickets do go down, and as long as I'm there, might as well do a little holiday shopping! This waiting is tough though- I've been reading what others are going through and am going to use the advice given to them.",
