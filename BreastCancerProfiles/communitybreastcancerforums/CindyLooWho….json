First on the HER2, they do the test as a standard now, but they don't know what it means for DCIS, only for invasive cancer. but they want the data for the future. Because I had stage zero DCIS and clear nodes and both spots were tiny with good margins (except the one I'm having revised from 2 ml to 5 on Monday) the MO said there is no value to tamoxifen because I have no breast tissue left in which to develop cancer. My BMX was, he said, ultimately the best treatment I could have ever asked for. Based on my pathology he says my odds are at much less than 1% and he can't improve that. He does want me to stop my nuvaring use in the next 6 months though. He said I need to eliminate the estrogen. I use it to help hormonal migraines. He advised waiting until I'm feeling better than stopping it and seeing how the migraines are. If they are bad then I need to talk to my PCP about preventive migraine drugs. He said I lucked out in my decision making process and made all the right choices...I am very thankful and understand how truly lucky I am. ❤",

He said it was so tiny it was like finding a needle in a haystack. You are correct there is no way to know they got all the breast tissue. I think if I had a larger area with smaller margins they might have suggested tamoxifen, but he said for me it isn't worth the potential side effects. Hang in there...hugs",

Don't know if I will keep them both, gonna wait see if I like the other too. Never occurred to me that insurance might cover. Hmmm PS said she uses glue and steristrips...anyone else have that?",

Then I read some women working after two weeks! I'm a project manager so lots of sitting and huge stress. Blessings thanks for the protein tip. And I did tell them I want the PT, they leave it up to the patient. Somewhere on this site there is an article that talks about fatigue and how it is a \"tired\" that no amount of sleep can fix. I guess it's different for everyone. I'm \"dealing\" with it ok for now, but honestly I'm afraid that post surgery is going to be very very hard for me emotionally.",
