I have another ultrasound in June for my follow up. I was supposed to follow up with my breast surgeon again in September, before my ultrasound this month, but never did because I felt I was being overly concerned with my breast lump/ pain. I am thinking of making my follow up now, with this report from my new ultrasound (take in all three ultrasounds images and reports), and have him explain them to me so I won't worry so much. last time he didn't even have all my reports or images. I tend to over think things...so I feel silly making doctor appointments, and only go if I have to. My pap came back negative for malignancy, and just inflammatory cells on my cervix so that is good, and I am still waiting to get my records for my LEEP, and cone biopsy that was done previously to see exactly what it was. Are you having any pain in your abdomen? Have you scheduled your follow up yet? I wonder if abnormal or irregular cycles have any connection to breast issues? Mine seem to be happening simultaneously. My doctor said hormone and cycle issues wouldn't be causing my breast issues. All week I have been having more breast pain and soreness in my arm/shoulder. Non cyclic.Comes and goes when it pleases as it has been for the last year. thanks for your reply!! I do feel better.",

Left breast a year ago was fine with some small simple cysts noted, and right breast had pain, multiple cysts,and a complex hypoechoic structure that was partially cystic ( BIRADS 3). Went in a week ago for my third ultrasound and they checked both breasts. The tech took my images to radiologist and came back twenty minutes later stating concerning area in my right was smaller and I didn't need to come back anymore for ultrasounds. Didn't even mention my left breast. I Was so relieved to be done! Then Dr. office called the next afternoon stating they had found something in my left breast and I needed to come back in six months to have it checked...I thought she was mistaken until I received a letter from imaging center the next day saying the same. Received my report later in the week that said this......... FINDINGS: Right breast: Oval hypoechoic structure at the 11 o'clock position, 4 cm from the nipple is noted. This measures 0.5 x 0.1 cm. This likely represents a small area of ductal ectasia. At the 10-11 o'clock position there is a simple cyst measuring 0.6 x 0.2 cm. At the 10 o'clock position there is an oval-shaped anechoic structure measuring 0.4 cm. Left breast: At the 1 o'clock position a simple cyst is present measuring 0.4 cm. At the 1 o'clock position there is an anechoic structure measuring 0.9 x 0.3 cm. This appears similar to the previous examination. This likely represents a focal area ductal ectasia or periductal fibrosis. No blood flow is evident. Follow-up ultrasound in this abnormality is recommended 6 months. The patient will be notified by letter. Can a complex cyst turn into ductal ectasia?? And what is that?? My doctor said she can't really explain it except to say it is changes in the tissue of the breast not a cyst, and that doesn't mean cancer but they will want a biopsy if it changes at all. So here I go with more six month waits. I just wish someone could explain it to me, and why did my radiologist say something so different than when I was sitting in the office. Each of my ultrasound reports say something different about the same area....how can that be? Thanks for listening :) Log in to post a reply",

My other two reports do not say it was near the nipple, and on my mammogram image the spot was up high and they even had to take additional images up towards my armpit . I am confused at how my other two reports say it is a cyst, and it can change to ductal ectasia. Also my radiologist sent me home with a \"you are good and no more follow ups\" only to completely change his mind. He also states the area on my left breast is \"similiar to previous exam\", but my first exam of the left breast and nipple are noted that there is nothing around nipple and some small simple cysts...no ectasia or structures that size? wondering if anyone out there has had or has Ductal ectasia, or had a cyst that was changed to this that can give me some insight on this. horsedoc....I too have had sporadic and irregular cycles this past year, just had a pap last week and am waiting for the okay on this. I had part of my cervix removed in my twenties (I am 32 now) for what I am assuming was precancer sells. I am thinking with these issues lately I should get my records to see exactly what my results were as I was young and unconcerned at the time. Wish I could give you some input!",

I'm always trying to rework my budget to find a happy medium! Let me know how your ultrasound turns out. Have you had any other symptoms that are associated with your ovary cyst? I have an appointment ( not until February!) to get my issues with the irregularity and spotting I have been having all year. I had some pretty horrible pain right after my cycle ended at the end of December that almost made me got to the ER, and then bloating, pain in my back/low abdomen/thigh, indigestion, breast pain in my right breast sharp and constant, and so tired for the following week. Also spotting after intercourse the last few times. Something is just not right! I have read that Ductal Ectasia happens when you are older and going through menopause or perimenopause.....wonder if it could be connected to my other issues? Also symptoms for Ectasia are nipple tenderness and pain, thick discharge, redness inflammation of the skin around the areola, and nipple rtraction when it is at end stages (fibrosis) and I have none of that! Makes me Wonder if this is even what I have? I ordered all my breast images (ready to pick up today) and records and made my follow up with the Breast Surgeon for the end of the month so he can explain things to me, and figure out if the ductal ectasia/periductal fibrosis is a new finding or a change to the cystic lesion they have been following. Next ultrasound is in May and I am hoping this time I will get a REAL \"you are good to go\" finding and not have to come back! Anyone with ductal ectasia/periductal fibrosis out there have any information/synptoms or are young in there early thirties???",

      "Content": "Jun 5, 2014 12:08PM - edited Jun 5, 2014 01:23PM by SarahRose This is my second opinion...the first was with a general surgeon at my local hospital who does work with breasts, but he was a gastric bypass doctor! He was very cold and suggested that this is just fibrocystic changes (this was after my first ultrasound) and that I am young (I'm 32) with no family history and even went on to say that he doesn't understand why radiologists recommend six month follow ups to patients and that it was not needed at all. He also said that trying to biopsy or aspirate would be pointless because it would just rupture if he tried. I took that as me overreacting and just waited until my next ultrasound. After the new ultrasound done a couple weeks ago showing they had grown some, and the new wording of partially cystic lesion I talked to my doctor again about the pain and my visit with the surgeon. She said I shouldn't have to live with pain and sent me to a different surgeon who is still a general surgeon but he specializes in breast care. He said if I had a family history he would do some other things like MRI and aspiration. He also said if it were bigger like the size of a quarter and he could feel it easy enough to just stick the needle in without an ultrasound he would just do it. So now I feel like I am just being worried and anxious for no reason. I tried to ask him about the difference in my reports, but he didn't have my reports and was asking me what the radiologist reccomended and what not...so I didn't get any real answers and feel silly pursuing it further as I don't want to appear to be going overboard about it if it's nothing!! I was hoping someone else might have some experience with it. I don't know of any breast centers near me either. If it is nothing why do I need to have follow ups for two years, and everyone wants me to come back to check up on it...why can't they just aspirate it and get my no big deal results so I can get on with my life without thinking about that next six month appointment. I am a mom with seven kids and a husband to take care of!!",

      "Content": "SarahRose wrote: So I have been having sharp random pain in my right breast where there is a palpable lump, and shoulder/arm pain. Breast surgeon (who only had my images, no reports, as he never received them before my appointment) doesn't reccomend MRI or FNA due to no family history and young age. Also said it doesn't look infected so no anitbiotics, and that fibrocystic/cystic pain is usually lateral not Bilateral like mine and runs with your cycles where my pain is random anytime of the month. Suggested taking Aleve a couple times a day EVERY day, and to come back in three months in between my next ultrasound date to follow up with him. He also said my lump (7 x 3 mm) would be too small to cause any pain, and malignency would not be painful and tender. Radiologists asked If I had history in my Family and after my answer of no he suggested 6 month follow ups for two years!! That's alot of ultrasounds. My question for anyone with experience with this is should I continue with this follow up or take the news as I have some unexplained pain and complex cysts and just move on? I feel like the continued appoinments are making me more stressed than just accepting the pain and moving on!!  Thanks for your thoughts!!! Also It was never explained what partially cystic lesion is, and why it changed to this rather than a complex cyst with debris as it was last time...what does this mean?? Here is a what my two ultrasounds said six months apart.   First one:  Minimally complex cysts likely representing inflammatory cysts at the 11 o'clock position of the right breast. Ultrasonography was performed of the right breast. At the 11 o'clock position of the right breast there is a minimally complex cyst present measuring 0.5 cm in greatest diameter. This likely represents a small inflammatory cyst. Second ultrasound:  Stable hypoechoic structure at 10 o'clock suggesting a complicated cyst with internal debris. There is a cyst at 11 o'clock position, 6 x 3 mm with no significant change. At 10 o'clock there is a minimally complex partially cystic lesion measuring 7 x 3 mm with no significant change. There is no new lesion or shadow. Log in to post a reply",
