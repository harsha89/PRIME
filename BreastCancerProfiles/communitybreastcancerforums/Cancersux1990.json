Well the people at Ibrance noticed and like how well she is doing and decided to shoot a commercial/documentary on my mother and my family! I guess there vision is to show and give people with stage 4 cancer hope that they can live a productive normal life!While the cancer is in all of our minds all day...we are trying to live a \"new normal\" life... My mother is strong and she actually looks better than ever! You would never tell she is battling such a stressful and harsh sickness! Since her cancer came back in Jan. we have had a lot of opportunities. I will be sharing the documentary on here once they let us see the final product! Log in to post a reply",
