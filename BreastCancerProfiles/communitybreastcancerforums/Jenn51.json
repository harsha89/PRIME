Dr. appt. had good news & bad.  The margins were negative but the lymph nodes were positive.  Not too many, 4 out of 29.  So I guess I'm going the chemo & radiation route.  Now I'm in waiting mode again, not seeing those 2 drs. until next week.  How, if the tumor was so tiny and the margins were negative, did it get to the LNs?  Is it a fluke or a weird fast spreading cancer.  I'm shaking all the time.  I went back to work Jan 2nd & that's good, but just moving my arm from the mouse to the keyboard hurts.  My drain is still in & I know they won't start chemo until it's out.  I want to get this started.  So many questions that have to wait till next week. Thank you for all of your supportive words & blessings.  They really help.  God Bless you all.",

SheShe48, A Belated Happy Birthday to you.  I vaguely remember my 49th.  That was the year of my hyster. & seems everything has gone down hill from there.  But I wasn't a grandma then either, so there is a bright side.  (see gals, I'm trying!) Carol, I like your new pix.  Good to see dh there too.  That is dh isn't it?  I don't know how you are managing all that walking.  But you seem to have more energy thru this than I could ever hope for.  You have really been a bright ray of sunshine through these last few weeks for me.  I am very grateful. I'm sorry to hear about your blood work.  I'd be bumming too. PALady,  I'm sorry to hear about your ex-bil.  I'm close to some of my exs too so I know how you feel.  It's hard to imagine you can't find anything about this form of sc on the web.  But some of these things are so rare.  I think it's great of you to try to help him.  I'm sure we would all agree that the more informed we are the more armed we are to fight our battle. Speaking of battles, my friend with the brain tumor lost his in April.  We were supposed to win our battles together.  He had been moved to a health care facility & I had not gotten to see him since he was moved.  I feel very bad about that but after tx #5 I was worthless. D1, you are always so cheerful.  I love to read your posts.  I have been going topless since some hair started growing back in .  I had been tl around the house this whole time, but not in public.  I've had some supportive comments but one that takes the cake in the other direction.  I walked into the ladies room at an interstate rest stop and the cleaning woman was in there.  She looked at me & said \"You sure cut your hair really short.  Why do you do that?\"  I said I was going thru chemo & hadn't cut it, it just fell out.  She just kind of grunted & walked off.  I had to laugh what else could I do.  I had been hot in the car and had taken my hat off.  Didn't think about putting it back on just to pee. I must have missed your plans with your mom & Willie, but I get the drift.  That must have been so much fun.  How nice you get a chance to repay your friend's kindness and to do so at a bargain....what more could you ask for.  Can't say that I've gotten any bargains or freebies by showing my bald head.  I bet it's more your bubbly personality that gets it for you. Kris, Congrats on reaching the half-way point.  You go girl! JulieK,  Wow, strawberries & a trip to the lake.  Sounds like heaven to me.  And your timing was perfect.  Your weekend sounds like so much fun too.  Be sure to take some open toed shoes so you can flash those toes when you go out to eat.  Sounds like you work with a great bunch of people.  How great they are supporting you in this way. D1, now you are talking strawberries.   I can't stand it.  I'm going to have to get some at the store this weekend.  I like Bisquick's recipe for shortcake.  I like to roll it out & use a huge drinking cup as a cutter to get perfectly round, individual servings.  Now I'm making myself hungry. I better go.  DH is grilling pork chops but I have to do the inside stuff.  Talking to you guys does make me feel better.  Thanks for being there.",

Well, I better start dinner.  My oldest ds gave me some Taste of Home recipe mags that his company prints.  Found a new one to try.  Wish me luck.  I haven't really cooked much in the last 5 months but old favs that I could do with my eyes closed.  I hope the brain is ready to follow instructions.  I'm wishing every one a pleasant evening, se free & too many blessings to count.",

I don't know how much dh promised to forgive, but it was worth it. They haven't looked so good since we moved into the house. At the clinic there has been a huge basket on the receptionist counter, prize for a silent auction with the proceeds going to BC. It caught my eye & I've been watching the bids. Today was the last day & I won it. There's a big pink ribbon blanket, shampoo & conditioner, 2 books, an Avon gift pack, socks, scarves, lotion & more. Also a gift cert. for a massage. Now I don't have to turn green every time one of you guys talks about getting a massage. I can't wait to schedule it. That was spirit lifter! I've spent some time tonight trying to find out where the moon will rise. It is supposed to appear to be exceptionally large. I guess I'm going to drive out to the corn fields to get a better view. This is something my Daddy & I would have done & I know he will be there with me tonight. Heaven knows dh won't, he's already asleep. Kris, I had some mouth sores. Biotene mouthwash really helped me but I had to use it faithfully. It doesn't taste that good but it doesn't burn. I'm anxious to check out the web site you mentioned. Rad doc said everyday on the table is probably making my already painful back even worse. She gave me some muscle relaxers & said to take them regularly for a few days. I think I can already feel an improvement. Tomorrow I go for a MUGA scan after rads so I will be on the go all day. With a little time to kill in the middle I may go to Joann's. I haven't roamed around there in so long. I need to get different flowers for the saddle on Daddy's headstone. I have always gone out there on Father's Day & cleaned his stone & changed the flowers. I didn't make it Sun. & it really made me feel bad but I think he would understand. I'll make it this weekend. Julie, I can picture you scurrying around the house getting ready for the cleaning lady a day early. Been there, done that. Then all that work for nothing. Remember you have to leave a little dirt so you can tell she has cleaned.  Carol, I know he may be right but I don't have to like it. I don't like thinking I'm not myself now. I know it inside but would like to hide that part from the rest of the world. But thanks, you always seem to know just what to say. Better go. I'm thinking of each & every one of you & wishing for good nights sleep, happy days and high spirits.",

M-F for 33 trmts.  Anything else you should know? Cathy, I have been friends with my 16-yr. survivor since Jr.High & she is my hair dresser.  At her house last Fri. we were picking out a wig when she decided to wash & dry my hair.  My drain which wasn't out at the time really appreciated that.  Anyway, while drying me she said \"Geez girl, you really need a haircut!\"  I gave her one of those looks & we both laughed for 15 minutes.  My hair is usually pretty short so I'm going to go until it gives signs of coming out.  Then she will shave me & style the wig.  I'm also on the lookout for some scarves because she says with my \"hot nature\" the wig will drive me crazy.  Maybe I'll just paint my head Colts Blue with a white horseshoe. ",

Vettegal, Thanks for the headcovers.com tip.  Will check that out this afternoon.  My scalp is beginning to feel weird when I rub it.  My BC Survivor friend said UH-OH.  Seems awfully early to me. JackieB,  Welcome.  This is a great group.  You might as well stay here since you are officially a Jan. starter.  Everyone here will be just a step or two ahead & can give great practical advise. Sista2 & D1,  No I don't have a follow-up w/surgeon.  Kinda wondered about that.  The swelling & soreness is better in the AM.  It's later in the day that it starts to bother me.  I HATE the thought of going to another Dr. appt!  I'll give it thru the weekend & maybe call Mon & see what they say. D1, Add me to the list for next week, 1/31.  I get Herceptin every week.  Did you ask for a copy of your labs?  I did & got one right away.  Today I made notes on it from info picked up here.  But it came with my count & the norm & flags on low counts.  I was only borderline low on WBC & RDW (don't know what that is) but nurse said it wasn't low enough to worry about.  I best get back to work so I can go see my wig when I'm done.  I'm sending happy thoughts & prayers to everyone.  I'll check in later.",

SisKimberly,  Thanks for the short hair poem.  Do these words just flow from you without any effort?  How great. JulieK, looks like you have a wonderful support group.  I envy you.  Most of my family is in Milwaukee, a 5-hr. drive from here.  We talk all the time but it's not the same as having your kids here to hug. I hear my recliner calling me.  I'll check in later on you guys.  I'm going to see if I can't print some of these pix with your names on them.  I can stick them around mu monitor & really 'see' who I'm talking to.",

D1, So you are out of contacts for a while too.  I only wear 1 for close up, reading , etc.  So when it isn't in I only need glasses for reading.  I have always put my glasses on my head when I didn't need them.  Guess what, without hair they don't stay there very well.  And I'm afraid if I put them in my wig I'll pull it off when I tried to get them off my head.  Wouldn't that be a sight, hair dangling from the earpiece of my glasses & me trying to put them on my face.  I broke down & bought a chain yesterday.  I really feel old with my granny chain around my neck.  But it serves it's purpose & I haven't lost them so far today.  I guess I'm going to call my surgeon tomorrow.  After looking for exercises on line I don't think I should still have this much swelling & discomfort under my arm as I do. %#^*&#, the last thing I wanted was another Dr. appt.  I'm with you on losing our nails.  The hair I can handle, but my nails NO WAY! SisKimberly,  thanks for the idea to look for Celine on line.  I still have no idea why it didn't record.  I had a couple of other shows scheduled that night & they recorded OK. Vettegal, I am so sorry you are having such a rough time.  The body aches & fatigue hit me so hard for a couple of days I can't even think about going for another tx.  But we all have to.  The other choice is unacceptable. LJ13, That fever was scary.  I'm glad things are looking better.  Get lots of rest & take your meds.  I think you did the right thing calling the Dr. in the middle of the night.  They don't give us guidelines like a fever limit for entertainment. Best go get something constructive done.  Even though I'm so much better than last weekend I can still only do 1 or 2 small chores before I have to rest again. Love & hugs to all of you.",

I have my IPod playing Neil Diamond.  He can always make me feel better.  I have been forgetting about using the ipod around the house.  Just took it places.  Crazy since we don't have a real stereo system.  Maybe that's what been missing in my life, music outside of the car.  All I have to do is remember that if I try to sing with it the outside world can only hear me, no music to cover some of my sour notes. Judy, I am sooo sorry the ses are hitting bad this time.  I'm on with this cumulative thing.  But the worse they get, the closer we are getting to the end.  That cough would worry me too.  I'm not sure I understand all of your diag. but it sounds like something to stay on top of.  Tell me, is it the problem with the Canadian health system that you are seeing a doc so far away & so far behind on your appts.  I have heard stories, some from Canadians, but you never know if they are exaggerated or not.  I take it for granted that all of my doc & hosp. are within a 10 mile radius and I've never had to wait more than a couple of day for an appt with an established doc.  My prayers are with you.  I know you don't look forward to that long drive.  Heck, I can get to my kids in Milwaukee in 320 miles.  Makes them seem down right close. SheShe48, Good catch on your arm.  That could have gone South real quick.  What will they do now, put in another picc, a port or go iv for the duration.  I'm sure this was in your good arm so you don't have the other side as a choice. Patty,  Just seeing his name, TS, makes my blood run hot.  He is aging well too.  Gained a little weight, but haven't most of us.  I also like those Jesse Stone TV movies that are on once in a while.  Magnum is out on DVD now.  The kids have gotten me the 1st season but I want them all.  It's bad when the current TV selection is so weak we all run to buy reruns of the good old shows.  When Magnum was on I always had the calendar for the season at my desk at work.  The 2 gals I worked with were also fans, so at the 1st of each month we would have a drum roll to turn the page & see what this month's pix was.  That was a big moment! KathyL,  Don't feel the least bit bad about wishing your little ones back to school.  I would wager that all of us moms have done that when there wasn't anything else going on in our lives.  I know I did.  And Easter, just talking to & watching my 3-yr old dgs wore me out & dh & ds were the ones taking care of him.  I can't imagine being \"Home Alone!\" with them all week.  You moms are real SHEROS in my book. Tina,  I guess my eating without tasting hasn't done too much damage.  From the beginning until a week ago I had only gained 6 lbs.  And when onc put me on diuretics I lost the 6 in 1 week.  Fingers still feel a little puffy, but it's only been a week. SisKim,  OK, I'm holding you to it.  Spring will arrive in 1 huge, gift-wrapped package & will wash the memories of this gray world from my brain.  I'm so envious of your trip.  1stCarol, now you.  We really don't have anywhere to go & dh can't get off work \u2018cause he covering for me & with the new software system someone has to be there to keep an eye on the youngsters.  (Don't get me started on the work ethics of the younger generation.)  And if we did I would have to drive because of his eyes.  I might manage energy to ride somewhere, but not drive.  I'm holding out for a flight to FL for a few days when chemo is done to see my cousin.  It's a silent dream for now but maybe when tx ref comes in I can ask. You have to joke about letters about mammos.  So much is done by computer these days it's easy to miss an update.  I would have done the same thing. Paula,  I'm glad you have the option to keep your well.  It stands to reason that you would have more minerals in your water than we do.  There is nothing to mine around here except for limestone. Well, I better get some work done.  Good luck to all at the bar today.  D1, I'm praying for a small needle.  I've got plenty of numb places on that side, maybe they can stick you in one of those.  I'll check in later.

Now is our turn for bad news.  My wonderful fil has been hospitalized.  A CAT scan they did this week showed major sirossis (sp?) of the liver, a large mass on a kidney and major fluid buildup in his adom. area.  1st thing they have to do is get rid of the fluid and they can only take off so much at one time.  They got 2 liters this AM & were hoping to get some more this evening.  They can't do any test with contrast because his kidneys are in such bad shape.  Also can't give him any good pain killers because of the kidneys.  They said if he were 50 he would be on the liver transplant list but he will be 80 in July & I guess with the other issues he is not a candidate.  I'm not sure how they will find out about the mass, malignant or benign.  We will just take one step at a time.  I am worried about dh.  On the outside he presents a strong front about my bc but I know how he is doing on the inside & it's not good.   Now to add his dad to the mix.  Sometimes he tends to drink his emotions away & I'm not sure I could handle that right now.  You know, I've never told anyone that before.  Goes to show how close I feel to you gals & how I trust that this won't change anything. Kimberly, I am so sorry you are feeling so bad.  Go back to bed, rest & come back when you feel better. PALady, What an ordeal.  I really starting to dread the dry run of this rad thing.  I have about 4 weeks till I have to make that appt. but it is not sounding like fun.  Rad doc made it sound so simple, but I'm learning they always downplay the situation. Sunshine, Congrats on finishing chemo.  I don't think I will be \"over it\" when I'm done.  I can imagine I will feel at loose ends for the rest of my life.  And I can't get over the worry of is it all gone?  Is it coming back? Don't feel like a lazy bum.  I'm sure you are getting a lot more done away from the computer than some of us who are here so often.  And it's good to hear from you whenever you pop in. KathyL,  I'll be on the Herceptin till Jan. '09 right along with you.  Maybe we should just float up into the sky together & go visit everyone.  And maybe I'm remembering what I read wrong.  Can't trust my brain these days.  I was trying to put away dishes today & couldn't remember where the crock pot was stored.  Had to ask dh.  You should have seen the look on his face.  You would think he'd be used to my questions by now. Carol,  You better watch that head of yours.  With chemo brain you don't need to add self inflicted brain damage too.  I bet your increased energy in AZ was due to being so relaxed & doing something that really made you feel good.  You know how easily we get up to catch that vacation  plane at \u2018o dark thirty when we can hardly drag ourselves out of bed to go to work. Having Peyton here made me feel better.  He seems to know I'm not quite right.  He brings me the puzzles & books & has dh chase & play on the floor with him.  And he wants to go to sleep on my lap in the recliner.  They are so precious when they sleep. Sounds like your dds have everything under control.  I hope you are able to let go & let them do their thing.  My dm came over today & dh took complete control of dinner.  Grilled pk. chps, scalloped pot. limas & apple pie.  He can really turn it on when he wants to. I haven't even heard about those 2 blood tests you mentioned.  Thanks for the tip.  Will do a little research in prep for my next visit with the onc.  I want to everything possible to make sure this cr@p is gone & stays gone.  D1, So you are having contact trouble too.  Glad I'm not the only one.  Tried them again this past week & had to take them out because I just couldn't see.  I know my Rx has changed too. Enjoy those games.  I hope your weather cooperates.  I think we are in for a few days of nice weather.  No rain till Tues & Wed & then some more sun. Therese, Glad to hear you have so much energy.  It brings hope that someday I too will have some.  I remember all those days of running kids from one place to another.  Hectic, but I still miss them. Paula, One thing I didn't miss by not having a daughter is dealing with someone elses  PMS.  I was a poster child for it (I have been told by more than 1 person) & I don't think I would have handled a daughters very well.  I hope everything settles down in your household soon. Vettegal,  A Book!  That's fantastic.  You will have to let all of us know when & where we can buy a copy.  I wouldn't begin to know how to start such a project.  You Go Girl! I'm glad you are getting some info out of your sis.  Maybe once she starts talking to you she will start to grasp reality.  Ask her some questions, make her do some research.  A positive attitude is so important but you have to accept what is wrong before you can be positive you can beat it.  I will include her in my prayers.  Well, it's gotten dark & there are no lights on in my room.  And I hear my recliner & apple pie calling me.  I check in tomorrow & hope everyone has a peaceful night.",

Yes, what I called needle placement you called guide wire.  That wasn't fun & it took him about 5-6 tries to get it in the right place.  I lost count.  I tried to take myself to my beach on Anna Maria Island, FL but kept feeling like I had stepped on a stingray or something.  If it's better than that then I'm set. I guess my dh is feeling sorry for me \u2018cause he has watched all of the DWTS with me so far.  And he has stayed awake thru them.  That's the real miracle.

Two sil are bearing most of the burden of this as they live in his town.  We are abut 40 miles away, another bil is 60 miles & a last one is in MI.  Supposedly this weekend all 5 kids are getting together in Dad's town.  No one can agree, tell him or not tell him, where he will go when he can't live alone anymore, lots of things I'm glad I didn't have to argue about since I'm an only child.  Pray I can get dh & bil up to Dad's in my fog.  This bil has same eye disease as dh & I won't ride with him or let dh.  His eyes aren't as bad as dh but bad enough he shouldn't be driving that far. Tina, You may be on to something with the weather.  To me Jan.-Mar. are the longest 3 months of the year.  This year April needs to be included too.  We are cloudy & cool again today. My heart goes out to your co-wkr.  She will be in my prayers too. Julie, It's good to hear from you.  I'm looking forward (not) to my fog rolling in this weekend.  I'm having trouble sleeping too.  I even took Ambien the last 2 nights & still laid there watching the clock tick.  How can we be so tired & not be able to sleep?  Steroids start tomorrow, that's going to help a lot. Sounds like your dh did a wonderful job with the sleep over.  Congrats to him.  I'm impressed. D1, With you recent luck maybe we should meet in Vegas$$$$$$$  Sorry you are getting pink already.  I don't burn very easily so I'm hoping I may be resistant to this burn also.  Don't know why I'm worrying about it now I still have 2 more Black Thurs. Maz, I'll welcome your company at the bar on Thurs.  It's my 5 of 6 too.  I know what you mean abut se.  Seems to last longer every time.  FUBC  FUSE Kris 60,  Good to hear from you.  Can't help with an answer, didn't take that cocktail. Vettegal, That is a pretty Vette.  Thanks for sharing.  And when it comes to Vettes, can the pix be too big.....Never.  Bummer to no sun. I had a great new pix of dgs, even got it to Photobucket but now have forgotten how to do it.  If someone would direct me to the directions, I would appreciate it.  FUCB (chemobrain).

KathyL,  Aren't the short txs nice.  I'm down to ½ hour for the Herceptin.  There still is the fluid & Benedryl but if things to smoothly I'm out in an hour at most.  I'm sorry you had an unsatisfactory visit with the np.  I've got 1 more tx left after #5 tomorrow, not counting the Herceptin for the rest of the year.  I'm sure I'm going to feel at loose ends.  And I don't know if I'll ever have a comfortable feeling that it's not coming back.  Don't worry about b!tch!ng.  Isn't that what we are here for?

Julie, Not another migraine!  FUMH  I can sympathize.  I was afraid my would come more often once I went off the HRT.  So far so good, but I sure wouldn't want to deal with that as well as the se.  Hang in there. I didn't do anything different last night but I got a better night's sleep.  Woke up with horrible pain in my ribcage.  It was Darvocet time it was so bad.  The more I thought about it I realized it feels like Pleurisy.  I've had it once years ago so I know the feeling.  Glad I see the onc tomorrow.  At least with the pills I can take a deep breath.  Now I'm wondering if that fluid has been building up & that's what showed up on the MUGA.  I get those results tomorrow too. Way to go to ds on the TKD honor.  I hope you will feel like going (I know you'll go, I hope you feel like enjoying it.) Paula, What a nice way to spend some time with your dd.  I'm sure you both felt better after a good talk. Thanks to all of you night owls.  You reminded me that I hadn't taken my evening Decadron.  I came home from work & had a small carton of yogurt to I would have something on my tummy and then forgot to take the pills.  FUCB!!!! Deb, I'm in for my 5th Taxotere tomorrow.  The fatigue is something like I have never experienced b4.  There is really nothing to do but give into it.  I tried to push on thru the 3rd one & I think it lasted longer because I did.  So I stopped trying to be a hero & gave in.  I hate to tell you, but you may as well be prepared, for me they got worse with each tx.  I'm not sure I'm over #4 & here it is #5.  But #6 is last & with the grace of God I will start feeling like a real human by late May. Kris, Congrats on completing  one leg of your journey.  My bff had a mastec. with ln involvement & she didn't have rads.  She 16-yrs out & no recurrence.  All we can do is trust our docs. Vettegal,  I'm so sorry about vettesis's news.  I am so glad that she is reaching out to you.  Is there anyway you could go to one of her dr. appts. with her.  I know having my survivor bff  with us was a big help.  She asked questions we didn't think of.  And if she thought I didn't understand something she would ask for a simpler explanation.  You are both in my prayers. I can imagine your Vettetherapy.  All convertibles are good for hair blowing, but a Vette....that's A1. Well, it's about time for Survivor & CSI the original.  So I'll post this & be on my way.  Max, I know you are joining me tomorrow & I think someone else is but, my chemobrain won't let me remember.  Cheers to all of us & may the se be minis.",

I'm still not sure what caused the pleurisy type pain.  It was better by the time I saw the onc (of course) but he still wanted to take a CT w/dye of my lungs.  Said since I also had shortness of breath it might be a pulminary embolism.  Ordered it stat, sent me flying to the hosp. right after tx but then said all was OK.  I'm a little puzzled what is causing it but I guess if he isn't worried I won't be either. I may have confused some of us if I said I read that Herceptin caused the water retention.  Onc told me yesty that it was the Taxotere.  Only have 1 more of those so maybe I can wear my rings again by June. I'm not sure what I did to make that big & gray but I can't seem to make it right.  The fog must be rolling in.  Sorry I can't get to shout outs but I've hit my limit.  Recliner is calling.  I'll come back when I can.  Love to all.",

I don't have any good news to share about Tyler. They won't try to take him out of the drug induced coma because his heart rate & bp are too high. They were going to do a CAT scan last night but his blood gases & O2 sat were too high. I don't have a good feeling about this. It sounds to me like his internal organs are acting up. My bff is managing to put up a good front. She is very optimistic about the outcome so I'll encourage her as best as I can. Tina, have fun with the graduation plans. I'm sure everything will go smoothly. I would show this ligament/cord to someone right away. From listening to D1 you don't want to have any le troubles if you can avoid it. My underarm is still so numb I can't feel the green tea when I spray it on. I have to watch myself in the mirror to be sure I'm spraying in the right place. I love your theory on broccolini vs broccoli. I'm waiting to hear her answer on that one too. D1, I'm not sure I want to watch \"I Am Legend \" because of the dog. I've heard things do not go well for him. But I'm with you on Will Smith. I loved him in \"Independence Day\", one of my fav flicks. Thanks for reminding me I'm getting older.   I'm sure that is part of the reason the knees hurt so bad. But for it to change so quickly I also think the Taxotere helped. If it will go away I can wait, I just don't want any more surgery. You do have a busy day today. I hope you don't get too tired. I've learned the hard way it is very hard to catch up if you over do it. You wouldn't have tossed a worm in college girl's direction, would you? That was so funny. I'm pretty squeamish about bugs, snakes, birds, fish, etc. but I can pick up earth worms. I try to do it at least once a year to remind myself that I can do it. Speaking of vision, I have been able to wear my contact all week. I even slept in it (OOPS) by accident last night. When I got up this am I kept telling dh that there was something in my eye. DUH!!!! It took 2 cups of hot tea to get to the point where I noticed I could read. Hey, guess what is in my eye. I do need to call my eye doc & see how long I should wait to get an exam. If it's taking so long for the other effects to wear off I'd guess it will be the same with our eyes. can tell my vision is not where it should be. Maz, good to hear from you. Glad to hear you aren't having any side effects. Are you nervous about radiation? Really there is nothing to it. It takes longer for me to undress than it does to get the treatment. I get \u2018shot' from 3 angles. Two of them use 2 different strengths. But it's just a matter of seconds for each shot. Today was #15 of 33 and I'm just barely tender. It's worse right around my nipple but the tea & cream she has me using really help. Carol, I haven't heard of a V-scan. I'll be anxious to hear what it's like. Kimberly, sounds like you had a great day. I really hope your trip is just as nice. I'm afraid we are in for some rainy weather this weekend. I hope it skips around you. I have to ask...what is a LA teacher? I have a friend who keeps wanting us to try fish tacos. Personally I think they sound disgusting but she assures me they are delicious. Thanks for sending The Schwartzbein Principal. I'll be on the lookout for it. I could probably write a Danielle Steel like novel about our office. I'm glad to know I'm not the only one the strawberries didn't work on. In fact I'd never heard of that one. One of these days we are all going to surprise our dhs by jumping their bods, but until then I'm happy with a good hug & kiss. Julie, your Relay events really sound nice. I hope the weather holds out for you. The weeds in your neighboring state of IN are just as bad. I think they must be HER2+. Anyone know where I could get some Herceptin for weeds? I'm sure you will be fine with the new software. I played around with a trial version & found it very user friendly. I'm sorry you are having trouble sleeping. I hope this pain wears off quickly.",

D1, I can totally sympathize with the toenails.  I was terrible as a child, picking at my toenails.  I would literally tear them off the bed.  As a result I have very damaged & very strange toenail beds.  The nail will grow so far I them start to separate from the bed.  If I let it do its thing & disconnect it's OK but if I help it along.....OUCH!  If you get another painful one you might try a big glob of Micitracin or Neosporin, something like that with a pain killer in it & put on a bandage before you go to bed.  By the morning it will feel lots better. Bummer on the insurance co. & their hardheaded ways.  Don't they understand we want to live a normal life again? Kimberly, nothing like an ambulance run to add some excitement to a BBQ.  I'm glad she is OK. OOOOOOLALA!  I like the Morning Magic as opposed to Afternoon Delight.  I hope my desire returns soon.  I'll watch him at work & remember how sexy he is & maybe get some ideas, then we come home & I'm too pooped to party.  Of course the night he decides to drink sends all ideas down the drain.  (That's where the beer should go!) I'm noticing more of those aches & pains than I did in chemo.  Or is it that the rest of me feels so much better that I notice the aches more.  I don't want to say anything to anyone because they might make me go to another doc or take more tests.  This knee is enough. Wow, if our mortgage pmt went up over $300 I'd have to do more than suck it up.  Of course, with all of the personal bennies it's hard to complain, but we haven't had a raise in 7 years. Congrats on the office furniture.  I love to rearrange things & get organized anew. Paula, glad to hear you liked Mama Mia.  I want to see it.  From the previews I can't imagine how you could walk anyway but happy.  I'm glad your dh was doing well enough for you to have some \u2018me' time.  We all need that. Kathy, I'm sorry you had the health scare.  I think we all are going to have things lurking in the back of our brains after this.  Is this OK?  Should I tell someone?  I know my onc is light on testing, believing you get too many false negatives.  But he says we just keep our eyes open for symptoms.  What symp?  Where do we draw the line between being a worry wart & ignoring something important.  I see him in 3 weeks & I'm going to try to pin him down a little more. Carol, Oh no!  Our resident ray of sunshine is cloudy.  I'm so sorry.  I'm hoping that since your post was Mon. & it is now Wed. that you are feeling better. My gf cruise last fall got diverted to Cozamel by Hurricane Noel.  The only thing I consumed on shore was Tequilla.  Yum!  And no Montezuma's Revenge from alcohol.  All of this talk of Mexican drinks sent me to the fridge.  Found a Corona & a lime.  I'm a happy camper. Topless, heh?  I haven't been that brave.  But we have a ranch.  I did cut the shoulder on one of my wife beaters.  Since my burn area was around the collarbone that worked just as well. I didn't get any rad burns on my back, but they kept checking back there.  The ones on the front were bad enough, I'd hate to have some on the back.  If your skin really gets raw ask about Silvadene (sp?).  It has silver in it, but it works miracles on the pain. Yes, go for the color on the head.  I did feel so much more like me.  And I actually am ready for a touch up.  In fact today I got it to spike on top.  I really like it & got lots of compliments on it.  I have a hair style!  Funny the little things that make us feel \u2018normal' again. Julie, I'm so jealous of your boating time.  I have to cross one of our reservoirs going up to the clinic.  It's not the big mansions that line it that trip my fancy, it's the people our on the boats.  For Pete's Sake, it's a week day.  Why aren't these people working?  I love the water.  My best place is on a sandy beach looking for seashells, walking in the surf.  But I'll take a day on my bil's pontoon with the rest of the family.  Too bad he lives 6 hours away. PALady, you were in Indy?!?!?!  I must have missed that post.  I would have loved to meet up with you.  If you are ever this way again be sure to let me know. I have degenerative disc disease.  They fused 3 vertebrae in my lower back, L3, L4 & L5.  They went in from the front & the back.  That was the worst thing, I couldn't get comfortable on my tummy or my back.  It really helped the back pain & sciatica. Cathy, I'm so glad your ds is doing well with the teeth.  I remember when I had my cut out.  The roots came out in pieces.  I wasn't very brave. The knee doc said the x-rays looked good, nothing broken.  So let's do a MRI.  Of course, another test.  He doesn't think the hardware in my back will present a problem.  He better be right.  I don't think he will be the one flying across the room toward those magnets if it isn't.  He said there might be something in there that will become worse by ignoring.  And if there isn't he has some things for me to do to try to reduce the swelling.  I'm pretty concerned because I can feel the popping & shifting going on under the knee cap & know that is not good.  Test is Fri., follow up is Wed. I talked to the vet yesty & today.  Thumper is doing good, post-op health is good & she is adjusting to hospital life.  The optic nerve looks good, she just can't see.  They are not discouraged yet though so I won't be either.  I did tell the vet of our plan to take her if her sight doesn't return.  Justin can be a bit rash & I didn't want him putting her down in a \u2018moment'.  Doc said she wouldn't let him.  She lost her eye sight in the 1st eye rather quickly too.  She has glaucoma & the vet says it can go that quickly.  Scary.  But our Casey was fine when we left for work one day & totally blind when we got home. The burns have gotten better each day.  Now just the center of the worse one is still tender.  Then it will itch & I have to stop myself from scratching this new skin. Well my fav delivery man just brought a sandwich for dh & a salad for me.  It's calling my name. Stay well my friends.  Here's wishes for good sleep, infrequent tears & sweet dreams.",

Does it ever get any easier telling your story over & over every time you see a new dr. or find out new info?  With 4 kids, a mom & several girl friends, I get all talked out.  And it seems when I talk abut it I get so shaky I can't even think straight.  And then there are the people at work.  It seems the last 2 days have been filled with more bad news.  I didn't expect the word \"aggressive\" to be used so many times.  I was hoping for maybe a 4x treatment course & now I'm getting 8x, then rad & of course the herceptin for a year.  So I didn't expect to have to have a port.  Like you guys I wanted to get this sh*^ started, but now that I have a date I'm in panic mode.  So much to do & with the MUGA & port & of course work I'm losing a couple of days.  My wonderful husband is legally blind so I'm the only driver in the house.  Maybe I'll breeze through this with few SE but we have to be prepared in case I decide to live in the bathroom for a few days.  I'm trying to stay positive (read my signature) but sometimes it gets the best of me.  It is really so good to have you guys here to laugh with, cry & b*tch with, to get advice from.....  Thanks again to all of you & May God Bless Us All.",

I get my treatments at a Cancer Center.  The treatment room has lots of windows looking onto the parking lot & recliners and some private rooms.  We get a pr tomorrow so we can watch the 'movie' and get nursing instructions.  Everyone out in the main room seemed to be chatting or reading, a friendly atmosphere.  Now where my aunt goes in Fla. each chair is partitioned off but they look out the window to a wildlife preserve.  Bird feeders & flowers etc.  Much nicer view than a parking lot. Vettegal, I can't believe your boss.  I am so blessed to work where I do.  No pressure, just come in when you feel like it - work all day 1/2 day whatever.  I can also work from home if I feel like that too.  And throughout all of this I will still get paid! Paula, you have some great co-workers. I best get busy.  Want to pm Carol about the shirt.  Have to change clothes to go out to eat.  I have cocker spaniel paw prints on my white shirt.  They were so glad to see me!  I didn't realize how wet the back yard was.  But I wouldn't trade them for anything.  Jake, my oldest one, has known something was wrong since before my biopsy.  And when I came home from the lumpectomy, he was so gentle getting up on my lap and completely stayed away from my right side.  These animals are a lot smater than we give them credit for.  Now my goofy Shaun, the young one, is a wild man.  Doesn't have a clue.  Oh well, they are a big comfort. Good luck to everyone having something done tomorrow.",

I just have to say again that you guys are great.  I told a gal in the chemo room about this site yesterday.  I hope she checks it out.  This is THE place to get good practical info.  And best of all come here to remind yourself that you are not alone. I'm on day #8 after 1st tx & have had a weird taste in my mouth for a couple of days now.  Started faint getting stronger every day.  And the inside of my mouth is not slick & smooth any more.  Running my tongue around the inside of my cheek feels like velvet or velour.  Nothing I can't live with but weird.  My bad taste is brought on by sweets.  If I can put salt on it it tastes OK.  If it's a cookie, energy bar, sweet drink - it's awful. I'm taking Pepcid 2x a day without fail.  That has kept the heartburn down to a mild roar.  My newest salvation is gas pills.  I'm getting gas so bad it feels like my lower ribs will crack. To the gals who had LNs removed...I lost 29 on 12/20.  The drain was in for about 17 days.  I'm still swelling in the area of the drain & underarm & very sore.  Is this normal?  The incision is finally getting better but the skin all around that area is very tender in places & numb in others.  My arm is still weak.  By the time I dry my hair I don't have the strength to use the curling iron.  Of course in another week I won't have to worry about that.  I am going to see THE WIG tomorrow.  If I don't like it we will have to hustle to another in time.  I'll let you know. Vettegal, that is a fantastic photo! Sista2, Glad to hear your 1st tx is over with.  Good luck with the se.  The waiting to see what happens is awful.  I have decided that I may be trying to do too much.  Don't follow in my footsteps.  I was so sure I would 'sail' thru the se that I pushed myself & tried to pretend everything was OK.  I think it's better to take it slower. I send my love & Prayers to everyone.  Take care of yourselves. SISKimberly, Glad to hear you had such a good day.  Can't wait to see the pictures.  Is it just me or are we all finding pleasure & really enjoying things we took for granted B4BC?  Time with family & friends, something that tastes good, a day we are not tired? Joan, my prayers are with you as you deal with your own trials as well as your mothers.",

I can't begin to give individual shout-outs to everyone, I just read from 1/31 to today, but.... believe me as I read each of your trials & pains I said a prayer for you.  With what we are going through with the tx & se we don't need the added pressure of ins. co, uncaring people in our lives, job & money problems.  I have prayed for relief from your se and what ever else has complicated your lives. To the Bald is Beautiful Group....You are beautiful.  I joined last Wed. night when so much of mine had fallen out I looked like an old lady with thinning hair.  You could see my scalp.  And I have very thick hair.  It was everywhere & I was sick of it.  Wore the wig home from the shaving & it was comfortable.  Wore a scarf & bb cap to tx on Thurs & haven't been out of the house since.  I actually don't mind myself bald too bad.  But right now it's too cold to go out this way.  I'll get some pix posted. Whoever talked about the rock in the stomach, you were right on target.  I get a little nauseous, but haven't thrown up.  But the other sensations going on in my tummy are horrendous.  I am hungry but afraid to eat because of that rock.  I am eating, grazing, but the habit to eat a full meal is still there & leaves me wanting more (at least in my head). The fatigue is the worse.  Even before tx #2, I could only do about 5 hrs at work & then came home & collapsed.  I feel like my gravity has increased 10-fold.  Anyone know that feeling? Zits!  Thought I was done with them after the hysterectomy.  4, count them, 4 on & around my nose as once.  Adds insult to injury. D1, I'm a day late, but Happy Birthday!  I hope you chocolate cake tasted good.  Last time I was off sweets but after this one they are not bad.  Maybe because I've tried things with cinnamon.  That tastes really good.  And salt, yes to ever is craving salt. I used Ayr gel for the bloody & dry nose problem.  It has aloe to sooth & lots of moisture to help sysmtoms.  Got it at the drug store with the cold stuff. I'm really bummin' that I can't beat these se.  I'm usually pretty tough, even worked thru most of my migraines etc, & I can't believe I can't fight this tiredness.  It's winning 7-10 days after tx & I HATE this.  I am grateful that I don't have some of the digestive problems some of you wonderful gals are burdened with.  But I thought if I wasn't vomiting I could push myself thru anything.  Sorry, pity party's over. I have to go for now.  Holding my head up is an effort.  I do think of you & I'm missing all the good posts.  This is day 6 after tx si maybe I can do a better job of staying caught up.  I love you all, thanks for being there.",

Just being able to crack the sunroof a bit & feel the sun on my face does wonders for a person's spirit. And it's supposed to stay like this for several days. Hey Carol, great pics! Good looking kids with a Jewel in the center. Don't those home-made cards really get to you? It sounds like you had a b-day worthy of a Jewel. I know what you mean by the weepies. There will be a couple of days that I will cry at the drop of a hat. Like really bad PMS. Augh! I thought I was done with all of that when they yanked my stuff out. I keep intending to start a journal. I'll have to back date a good part of it but like you I have a calendar with everything important on it. For the record I went in for yearly mammo. They found micro-calcifications & called me back for a diagnostic mammo. That confirmed the m-c & I was told to make an appt. with the surgeon. I had the same thing about 5 years ago, they were benign so I wasn't really worried. The surgeon did a stereo-tactic biopsy & I didn't think another thing about it. (More on this feeling later). So when he called me at home a few days later, he, the actual Dr., my knees went out from under me. He said the biopsy didn't show what we wanted & could I come in the next day at noon. I gathered my dh & my bf & off we went. Lumpectomy 1 week later & you know the rest of the story. One very ironic thing....I was about 6 weeks late with my gyno appt. Usually have the m-gram the same day, but this time they couldn't get me in. Said I could come in the next week, but no I was going to be cruising the Caribbean with the gfs. Ended up being about 3-4 weeks before I had the appt. Now I've been told these m-c were really tiny, but very fast growing. IF I had gone in on time would they have shown up? I don't think so. And if they were growing that fast I know I would have been in serious trouble before my next annual. I believe this is one of my own personal miracles, that more than fate had a hand in my timing. I'm not sure what my future m-gram schedule will be. They told me that I would never have just a screening mamo, that I would always go to the diagnostic center. And some one said something about every 3 months for the 1st year, then every 6 mos. My bf is 16 yrs out & she is only going 1 time a year now. That's on my question list. So you had dachshunds too. Are they the cutest things. Our 1st one came to me from Santa! Probably one of the last years I really believed, but that year nothing could have changed my mind. We have cocker spaniels now. A black one & a golden one. Clowns! Cathy, Thanks for the encouraging words. My onc's nurse called today with MUGA results. The test itself was great. And she said there was no note about a shadow. I'm going to hope everything is OK, but talk to my onc face to face on the 20th.  This guy seemed so certan that something wasn't right. Joan, I'm so sorry to hear about your dog. And right now when you could use all of the love they give. Do you have any pets to pamper you? I swear my guys know \u2018something' is wrong. I'm getting so much more quiet love from them lately. It's good to know someone else is in my age bracket. OK, KathyL, I won't push on it again. I have to admit I have in the last few days to see if I could feel what he saw. I really don't understand because 1 of his ?? was did I have implants. And then the next was did I have part of my lung removed. Was he seeing something missing or something extra. Gonna put it out of my mind until the 20th. But thank you for the help. This MUGA was early because I told the onc that I was out of breath so much of the time. That's another ?? for him, if the MUGA is fine, why am I out of breath? I've also heard that you are only as old as you feel. If that's the case I must be 100 lately. Well, I better sign off for now. Tomorrow is my 1st real pt session. I'll let you know how it goes. I'm thinking positive thoughts for all of us to have a good day tomorrow. One day at a time, that's all we can do. Hugs to you all.",

CHJ, I am so glad (not really, but misery loves company) to hear you are suffering from serious chemo brain too.  I was OK with the small goofs, forgetting a word etc.  But now I have found myself stopping in the road where there is no stop sign or light, I mixed up (& missed) my ddil's b-day & forgot the day my dgs was having his tonsils out.  I couldn't have gone but I could have prayed him thru it.  Thanks for the heads up on paying on-line bills.  That comes up in the next 10 days & I better be on the look out for what I did last month. SisKim,  Keep on thinking those thoughts of Spring.  I just noticed today that my pussy willow bush has pussies on it.  It's actually supposed to get into the 50's here this afternoon & go a few hours without raining.  Dh said he would clean up if I got out & raked some dead stuff.  If I could at least do the bed in front of the picture window I would feel great. D1, Tell your onc about the water retention.  Mine gave me diuretics right away & they have really helped.  Excess water is not good on any part of the body. Hooray! On no needle.  Hooray on it being nothing more than scar tissue.  You might ask your pt or even babydoc about some soft tissue massage you can do during rads that might help.  That is one thing that SNB pt spec. has been doing to me. Have fun with the dds & dh this weekend.  I really envy all of you who have short trips you can take to get away from the whole bc scene.  I shouldn't complain, dh & I are going to Lowe's today & dinner at Outback.  WooHoo!  I have been craving a good steak & a Bloomin' Onion may eat my mouth alive but will be worth it. Carol, I'm so happy you are enjoying your trip.  And all of that golf, I'm not a golfer but I couldn't be taking a walk that long right now, even if Neil D & Tom S were at the end of the path.  Our Race for the Cure is 4/19.  I'll be downtown but don't think I can make the walk.  But there are so many festivities that I won't be bored while bff walks.  Her bil doesn't walk either so I will have someone to hang out with.  I still can't grasp the idea that after all of these years walking in support of bff that this year I'm going to be in the Survivor Parade with her.  Better have lots of Kleenex with me. Count me in on the Secret Pal thing.  Sounds like fun.  I've been getting such nice little pick-me-ups from the Chemo Angels it would be nice to do something in return.  As we come to the end of our chemo I can't bear the thought of not chatting with everyone in the future.  Those of us with rads are still going to need to be in touch. Paula,  Got the IPod going again today.  I realize how much I've been missing music in my life since I've been home so much.  That is some mix you have there.  I thought I was out there the year I got Neil & Queen for Christmas.  Listening to Billy Joel right now.  I have to watch who I listen to lately, doesn't take much of a sad song to make me cry.  My ds #1 gave this to me in Jan, his old cast off.  It came loaded with my kind of music & I haven't tried to add anything yet.  Until last night.  Total Failure!  Gonna have to get ds on the phone to walk me thru it.  And I remember the time he would ask for help on his \u2018puter when I would come up to visit.  How things change. Julie, Hope your home survives the sleep over and you don't face too bad of a disaster when you emerge from the fog.  Brave dh you have there (or really naïve).  Don't worry about it, just drift with the fog until it leaves.  I've found the harder I fight it the longer it lasts. Tinalea, I'm with you on the exercise.  I wish I could make myself do it.  And the weather here in IN doesn't give me many opportunities to be outside.  I had gained some weight before this bc thing & I'm sure not losing any now.  I know the exer. would be great for me, just can't get motivated.   The blues doesn't help & I know the exer. would be good for that too.  It's like I'm in a vicious circle.  Don't feel like doing the things that would make me feel like doin' them. Does it seem like many of us are hearing bad news about other friends & loved ones.  I know I haven't known as many people with C as I do right now.  It's scary.  We all just have to keep positive thoughts for ourselves and others.  My dm is a big fan of Dr. Norman Vincent Peale's Power of Positive Thinking.  It worked for us a few years back when my dd had some unidentifiable brain virus.  He was in a coma for days & she said she kept picturing him opening his eyes & saying \"HI\" one day.  And he did, just like that.  He was granted several miracles from God before He finally took him Home 3 years ago.  And if I talk about him any more I will end up crying, I miss him so much. If I were you I would call Visa & try to get them to waive the charge.  If you have a good record & explain the situation........ you never know. Dana, I can relate to your valley of weeping.  Reminds me of the Footprints in the Sand.  You know I have a poster of that somewhere.  I need to hang it on the wall in front of my computer to remind me that He is carrying me now.  I like the victim/surv. thing too.  I'm printing that one too.  Thanks. Peg1212, Aren't those 3-year old dgs' the greatest.  What I wouldn't give for mines energy.  And they are great motivators to keep on going.  Like the Energizer Bunny!  I just thought of that & he is even pink!  We all need to think of ourselves as the EB. Patty, What happened to your thumb?  Is that where they put your IV?  Or where the vein blew?  Sounds awful either way. Well, it's noon & I'm going to eat a bite & see if it's warm enough to be out even ½ hour.  My neighbor is out & all bundled up, but I'm going to try.  I wishing small se for all & a wonderful weekend to everyone.",

Cathy, thanks for the tip.  Told them at work that Tues. is questionable.  How many of you guys are still working thru chemo?  I'm at a great place that will let me work as much or as little as I feel like.  And I know it will depend on how hard the se hit me, but I just wondered. Donna, thanks for the good word on your port.  I know what you mean by being tired of being a big girl.  Everyone keeps telling me I'm so strong when I really just want to find a corner & hide for a while.  But I hate to disappoint anyone so I suck it up.  But I think the dam is going to break one day real soon. I'm off to bed.  Have to be at the hosp. at 7:15 am tomorrow & I'm NOT an early riser.  Blessings to you all.",

JulieK, I'm so sorry about your migraines.  I had them regularly until my hyster. 8 yrs. ago.  I've been on hormones since then & thought that was keeping them at bay.  So when the surgeon said no more hormones I was terrified they would come back.  Knock on wood, so far not a one & I gave up the drugs in Dec.  Anyway I feel your pain. Denise, Welcome to the best bunch of gals you'll find on the web.  Feel free to brag, whine, cry, question, go MIA for a few days, anything & they are all here to support you in whatever you need. Sista2, I'm sorry SE #2 is worse for you.  Especially the vomiting.  I know when I made it thru the 1st one without that SE I was sure I wouldn't see it ever.  What a let down.  My SE #2 were worse too, but only the aches, fatique etc.  I hope this isn't going to get worse with every tx.  By the way, I wear warm, fuzzy hats (even in the house when I'm cold).  You know you lose something like 80% of your body heat through your head. Deb, I hate to say this but misery does love company.  It's awful I know but it is good to know others are in the hole with me.  At least there is someone down here to talk to. Kris,  I think there has been a whole fleet of semis that have taken aim on us. And Amen to the comparison to being PG!  I didn't have morning sickness with any of my boys (is that why I'm spared here?) but the heartburn & heavy stomach feeling was sure there.  I'd crave something to eat & then feel awful for eating it.  One thing, I don't remember being bald while I was PG. SisKimberly, No we don't own our business but we both work for the same small, family owned business & have for years.  It's a manufacturing company that makes a specialized, electrical resistor, called a shunt.  17 people in the shop & 7 in the office, Jon is the controller & I'm kinda the office mgr.  Handle the inside sales & make sure things happen how & when they should.  Our IT guy, the owner's son has linked my home computer to the one at work so I can go in & monitor what's happening or make it happen myself.  The owner, Gary, is our age & more like a brother than a boss.  He's being great thru all of this.  Someone is always happy to come get Jon or bring him home.  Luckily we are only 3 miles away.  We are so laid back we even have 2 office dogs that I love dearly.  I'm not sure you really wanted to know all of that, but I do love my job & when I get started........well you see how it is. Suz, I wish more of us were thru with our tx & could help.  I do know that I've had plenty of weepy days already.  Last Sat. I would start to cry for no reason at all.  Maybe it's a delayed reaction.  I know my question for a long time is going to be \"Is it really gone?\"  \"Is it coming back?\"  And those questions could make me cry.  I agree that if you can't shake this feeling you should talk to your Dr.  Depression is nothing to mess around with.  Don't let it take control of you.  Listen to someone who has been there. Vettegal, Let's see I get: 1.  Saline 2.  Benedryl 3.  Herceptin 4.  Aloxi 5.  Another antinausea that's pushed from a syringe into my port. 6.  Taxotere 7.  Carboplatin So, with you not getting the Herceptin, the count is the same.  And they do them 1 at a time - same with you?  My bosses son gave me a portable DVD player to take on the long days, sure was nice last week.  On the shorter, Herceptin only days, I can just read. OK, time to go.  I got cleaned up & made into work for an hour this evening.  Just about wiped me out, but it felt good too.  Tomorrow is a Herceptin day & I hope to work the rest of the afternoon.  Best wishes to all who are stepping up to the bar tomorrow, Hang in There to all who are still fighting SEs and Hugs to Everyone.",

We tried to find one that was as close to my normal style as possible. This is the way my hair would look if I had a good hair day everyday. But who among us has that? As for Joey, he is the perfect of his Mommy & Daddy. He is my pride & joy. Carol, Glad you liked the cat shirt. One of the scarves I ordered from Ebay is covered with cats. I love to find clothes with animals on them. I'm sure Stacey & Clinton from What Not To Wear would have a stroke at some of the things in my closet! I envy you your King Crab. We took the kids to Joe's Crab Shack Sat. night & I know what we had would pale in comparison. But it wasn't bad for land locked Indiana. Vettegal, I loved it that you put your mom in her place. I had to do the same thing with my mom. It was before my hair started coming out. She kept making comments about me losing my hair & finally said something like \"this is the worse part of you having bc\". Well, that did it. Before I could stop to think I said \"well, I would rather lose my hair than die.\" That shut her up. But I can tell she would rather me have my wig on when she comes over. So what do I do.....you got it, go bare! I am so bad. Too bad your brother can't support you like your sis does. 2 of my sons have shaved their heads to support me and even my little Joey thought my baldness was OK. I haven't seen any sign of new hair growth. But I still have the tiny fuzz that was left when gf shaved with a 0 razor. Weird, the stubble hasn't fallen out, but nothing new has grown. Same with my eyebrows. I had them waxed right b4 I started chemo. Nothing has grown where I wax, but everything that was left is still there. Same story with my legs. Why doesn't it go ahead & fall out? Now the hair down there is gone, it all fell out by itself with the exception of maybe 10 hairs. Now isn't that sexy?!? My deepest sympathies to those of you with Aunt Flo. I had a hyster 8 years ago but the visits right b4 that were 30 days a month. I can't imagine doing that & the se too. I get a daily email from Beliefnet & last week there was a notation about chemoangels. I checked out their web site & signed up. It a group of women that send little pick-me-ups to those of us fighting bc. It's something I would like to be on the giving side of when this is over. But I think you all should check it out. I have been assigned 2 angels & have received the nicest cards & little presents. One coming on a day I was really feeling down & did pick me up. The webiste is chemoangels.net. PT is going well, although I was not good at doing my exercises this weekend. Denise, the expert, is teaching Nicole, the pt, to do tissue massage to loosen the cording in my arm. I can tell a difference when she is done. She measured the strength in my right hand (the bad side) & I couldn't believe how much weaker it was than the left. She gave me some putty to squeeze & next time is going to measure dexterity. How I don't know. It's a bit of a drive up there & with gas prices I'm glad I don't have to pay for the pt too. However, the hosp. is in the same town as the best fried chicken place I know of. So guess what we are having for dinner. Think I better go get some b4 dh eats it all. Isn't it amazing how quickly I can respond when I've only been off the board for 24 hrs? Good luck to everyone having their chemotails tomorrow. We are all getting 1 tx closer to the end. Hooray!! Have a great evening & Tues. Hugs & Love, Jennifer",

Gave me pee pills for the swelling & after listening to what the MUGA tech said about the thing that was either missing or extra ordered a chest xray & contract CT fo the chest. I get them in 2 wks. & discuss w/him in 3. Gotta put it out of my mind until then but after today I'll be in such a fog it shouldn't be hard. Going to have to put Easter dinner in the hands of dh, dm & what ever sons show up. Luckily they are all very good in the kitchen. Better make the baskets tonight or later I may not have the energy. And that's something dh couldn't do. He'd just throw the stuff in & we all know it has to be arranged just so. Carol, Tell your dh I'm in his camp with the mowing. I know it's hard to let go, I've been fighting it since this started. I'm getting better when my dh is in the kitchen & I hear strange noises. If I intrude too often he closes the door, then I do go crazy. But if you remember his eye situation, you can understand why I worry. But we do need to rest & let ourselves heal. I'd heard earlier that Tylenol can be harmful if overdosed. You know how we all take 3 or 4 aspirin or Advil on occasion. After all prescription strength was for that many. But not Tylenol. Take as directed & you are OK, get in trouble if you pump up the dose. And like you I've been that's the only thing I can take during this year. Doesn't do much good, but better than nothing. I'm sorry I didn't get the file sent off last night. My post was so long I was too pooped to think when I was done. It's coming this evening I promise. Dana, I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but do you think this is the place to be telling us our docs don't' know sh*t? We have to trust someone these days. My onc is one of the best in the city & my surgeon just received the Susan B. Komen award. We can hope & pray for better results than have been predicted & praise God when we beat the odds, but as for me my doc's word is the best I can get from a mortal. NO, this is my 4th out of 6. Sorry if I was confusing. I have chemo fingers these days. Thank goodness for spell checker. I bet I mis-spell something in every other sentence. And I have to go so slow. I used to be a power keyboarder. To all with guys who can't look at the beautifulness of our baldness..... I was teasing one of the guys at work, big, strapppin' production foreman when my hair was falling out. Even chased him around the shop with a hunk of it. Then I found out his mom died of bc when he was pretty little & he was troubled by the memory of her going bald. I wanted to cry I felt so bad. Big hug & promise in his ear to never do it again & we were OK again. But I find he looks at me better when I have the wig on (Miss Kitty) than if I'm wearing just a scarf or bb cap. Maybe some of these guys can't face us bald because that is physical proof of our battle. Makes it too real to them. You know us gals are much tougher than the guys.    Vettegal, My prayers will be with you & your sister tomorrow. KathyL, I saw my onc today & he gave me some diuretics (sp???). With taking the 1st one of those + all the fluids in the chemotini I can hardly type a paragraph without taking a potty break. Hopefully by tomorrow I can get my wedding rings on again. I feel naked without them. Thanks to everyone for your thoughts on ds Clay. I'm not going to push the therapist right now. Our family doc. up there is great & will stay on top of things. And Clay has known him since he was about 4th grade & feels comfortable with him. I tried to encourage the boys to tell me everything when they were growing up. Succeeded with #1 & #3, Nick & Clay. Geno, the middle child is another story. Nick has his wife now so I don't hear as much of his problems but Clay & I are still very close. I hope he finds a way to come down for Easter. Maz, I am so glad your bff called. I sure you will be good for each other & as I've learned here we all need someone to talk to. I will continue to pray for both of you. Well, I feel the recliner calling me. And I have a file to send to Carol. I'll check in tomorrow if I can get back here to my room. I don't have a laptop. If I did I would never be off line. Got a new game for the Nintendo DS the boys got me for Christmas. Perfect timing. The stylus isn't too heavy.   Happy Birthday Dana! I seems we have so many Jewels with secondary problems our prayer circle keeps growing. We will make it & our loved ones will make it. We are Women, Hear Us Roar! Prayers, love & hugs to all.",

After saying I hadn't been able to nap lately, I slept all day today.  I took dh to work with every intention of coming back, getting ready & going in.  Didn't happen.  I sat on the bed for a minute & next thing I knew it was 4 hours later.  I got up, ate some lunch & went right back to bed.  I must say I feel much better now so I must have needed it. Carol, I can so sympathize on the emotional moments.  I know you didn't want it to happen on the plane but we don't seem to have much control over these things.  It may be late but I'm sending you an extra good hug. I'm sure your babies really missed you.  Mine are always all over me when I come back from a few days in Milw.  I will post pictures of the Race.  I have good ones from years past.  When is your Race?  My bff is bringing the t-shirts & numbers over here so I can help get everything ready.  I wanted to be more involved this year & she needs the help.  It will be the Mon. after a Black Thurs. but if she comes to me I think I can do it.  My big thrill last year involved one of our Indpls. Colts.  Jeff Saturday, #63, our center, is very involved in Komen Indy.  He was a surprise speaker at a luncheon last year.  I got a really good picture of him (and he is very easy on the eyes).  I printed it at 5x7 & took it to the Race with me.  I got the chance to get close to him & he autographed it for me.  He now hangs on my Colts wall of my room.  And this was the spring after we won the Super Bowl so it's even more special.  Wasn't sure what I could do to surpass that this year, but have a feeling the Survivor Parade will do it. Reunion in AZ!  Count me in! I think you did the smart thing going straight home.  I take it you were able to find your house.  (Sorry couldn't resist.)  Not always easy doing the smart thing but I have to laugh at the vision of you on the golf course & having a different kind of melt down. D1, Thanks for the very descriptive rad session.  I hope mine go as smoothly as yours.  Not sure about your relating the tat to a bee sting.  I'm allergic to bees, swell all over & have to go for shots if I get stung.  LOL  I do know what you mean though.  Did you have needle placement before your surgery?  If it's not much worse than that I can handle it OK. I'm sorry to hear about your bil & will include him in my prayers. Tina,  I have been thinking of you when I heard the weather reports.  I can't believe you are being hit again.  We are getting LOTS of rain & it's getting down to the 20's tonight.  I hope none of it turned to snow.  Think Spring!!! 2 of my 3 cats think they are entitled to my body while I try to compute.  I don't know about them.  Just know I wouldn't want to try to live without them. Sounds like your co-worker caught her bc early, even though she hadn't had a mammo in a few years.  That's one good thing you can chalk up to your bc, made her think & act.  Good Going! Sunshine, I'm with you on the fuzzy head thing.  It's not growing, but the fuzz won't fall out.  I do have a couple of spots that seem to grow very slowly, maybe the size of a nickel.  I shave them so I don't look so weird.   I had my sticker shock a few weeks ago.   We got hit with 2 deductables, one in Dec. 2007 & 1 in Jan. '08.  That hurt but we are still lucky to have the coverage we do. KathyL, Go ahead & whine.  We are all entitled to every so often.  Fatigue, body aches & nausea are so much better than puking but they are no picnic either. I got Joey one of those camera last year.  Luckily he didn't think of sneaking into the bathroom.  I got my love of photography from my dad & 2 of my boys seem to have picked it up too.  It's only natural that we want Joey to follow in his great-granddaddy's footsteps.  SisKimberly, I will get my envelopes in the mail to you by the end of the week.  Thanks for taking charge of this. I took a break to watch the Dancing Results.  I was very disappointed.  I liked ##### (name omitted for those who taped the show).  I'd much rather see Adam or Marissa go home.  Right now Jason & Marli are my favs.   We tried the new Broiled KFC tonight & it was really good. I'm going to try to go to bed.  I really need to work some tomorrow.  Thurs. I will be gone most of the day because I'm getting a chest x-ray & CT-scan after my Herceptin. Good luck to you all at the bar tomorrow.  I'll pray for mini ses for you and blessings for everyone & their loved ones.  Sending lots of Hugs & Love.",

Carol,  Your retreat sounds wonderful.  I wish I could find something similar around here.  I'm totally with you in the chair with a blankie & sunshine. I too was touched by the daughter of a school friend.  She called from Miami to ask if she could walk in my honor in the Relay for Life.  Katy & I have always been close, I told her she was the daughter I never had.  But her folks moved to TX & I haven't seen her as often as I would like.  But when we are together it is like being with a child of my own.  Somehow an inexplicable but very special bond exists between us, maybe inherited from the close friendship with her mom. Is it chemobrain or didn't you clobber yourself in the head last time you tried to mow the yard?  I hope this time you steered clear of hanging bird houses. Happy, Happy Birthday to Grandma.  And good luck to db & fam on the celebration.  One of my dg lived to 96 & the other to 92.  Hope their longevity is inherited.  Therese, Good to hear from you.  You sound great!  Good luck returning to work.  The way my brain is working lately I'm afraid to do much.  Already got 1 customer upset b/c I sent her the wrong email. Paula, I remember the days will all of the ds were involved in b-ball.  I really miss those days, sitting in the bleachers, chatting with other moms.  It really goes by too fast.  Cherish the time while it's here. It's nice to hear dh helps with the laundry.  My dh does it every week.  I do have to remind him of the things that don't go in the dryer but usually he does a pretty good job.  How about if dd keeps her own hamper in her room?  Would that stop dh from doing her clothes? Patty,  Good to hear from you.  And welcome to your sis if she is reading this.  Will be anxious to hear about your rad appt. Wendy,  Sorry to hear about your day.  That was a bummer.  I've never had a transfusion so can't offer any advise there, but if onc agrees with np I think I would do it.  You don't want the counts to get so low they postpone your txs. The last time I left the house I made 3 trips around checking faucets, lights, tvs, locked doors, anything that I could have screwed up. KathyL,  I must have missed your post about twitching eyes.  Mine have been going crazy too.  I don't know , I think tonic water tastes pretty bad, unless it's doctored up with vodka & lime.  Think that would work the same?  I'm envious that you can still wear your contacts.  My eyes are so dry they feel like they are made of sandpaper.  And I tried them the other day & couldn't see as I should have with them in.  Seems I heard our eyes might change during chemo & it could take as long as 6 months to straighten out. I get Herceptin every week.  Since I'm also getting TC every3 it's hard to say which side effects are from which.  I don't notice anything on the H only weeks.  But now I've read that it can cause the water retention.  The 1st week after my onc gave me water pills I noticed a big improvement.  But it's back now.  Wk. #1 I lost 6 lbs, wk. #2 I gained 7 back again & my hands & feet are swollen again.  I know my eating habits aren't varying that much from week to week.  I see him next week so will mention it again. D1, You sure sound chipper today.  Glad to hear it.  Yeah, I really don't want to have another guide wire procedure.  At least I'm going to ask for the cold spray they use on my port.  I don't remember too much about the dye but it came after the wire so I was probably in a stupor by then. Glad to hear I'm not the only one screaming to the empty house.  My precious critters really think I've lost it.  They run for cover even though they haven't done anything. Tina, Something in AZ near the mountains would been fantastic.  During my 1 & only stay in Palm Springs, CA we took a horseback ride into the foothills of the Santa Anna mts.  One of the most amazing days of my life. My nails are still growing too.  I hadn't really thought too much about it.  My onc said it was OK to continue prof. manicures unless I noticed a problem developing.  Really glad I didn't have to give up that treat. Julie, Not another migraine!  No this isn't fair.  Just lay low until it passes.  I'll be thinking of you. OK, time for another nap.  Have to rest up for Peyton tonight.  He's the 3 y/o & full of energy.  I hope everyone has a great weekend, full of mild se, energy & happy thoughts.  Sending lots of love & hugs.",

I had a major computer meltdown one time because I left it on during a storm. We just had a tiny glitch in the power but I nearly lost everything. Couldn't get to the Windows log on screen. It took 3 days & hours on the phone with the MS tech people to get to where I could recover my data. The worse was the 1000s of pix I had stored there. So, my \u2018puter doesn't come on during a storm. Tina, my granddaddy grew raspberries. They lived in the So. part of Indiana & if we weren't coming down while the berries were \u2018on' they would drive up bringing me quart jars full. And always a smaller jar for me to eat all at once. Many times I made myself sick eating straight from the garden; strawberries, cherry tomatos & the raspberries. Happy memories. Kimberly, I absolutely love your dog story. D1, Beets YUCK, YUCK & DOUBLE YUCK. I'm with Julie on this one. Cool on the $20. I would have been excited too. Luckily our hosp. garage doesn't charge to park & the cancer center is in an indus. Park type area with parking lots, again no charge. Don't know if I could afford gas & parking. I do envy you your painters. I have to drive past some really fancy houses on my way to the clinic. I was thinking today that I don't want a house like that, I like the house we are in. I just wish I could have a few things done around here. Painting would be at the top of the list. I painted our bathroom last year & hung wp border. But there are still a few touch ups & detailing I need to finish. I'm so bad at not finishing what I start. I would love to have someone come in & do it all in one swoop. Paula, whether it's good news or bad I always think it's better to know what you are up against. I'm glad you have more knowledge on your dh's condition. I too would be very frustrated that they couldn't operate but this may turn out better. I won't quit praying for you & him. Going topless was part of my reclaiming my life after chemo. We all know how well part of that turned out, couldn't work the way I planned, but I stayed topless. This is the me that I am now. Take it or leave it! Of course I don't have to worry about children or their feelings but I have looked at my balditude as my badge of courage throughout this whole ordeal. LJ, I know what you mean about all the directions the hair grown back in. Either I've been parting my hair on the wrong side for 57 years or my part is now on the different side. There seems to be no rhyme nor reason to the direction it going. This will be really interesting when it gets a little longer. KathyL, sorry to hear about your tummy distress. I hope all is better as you read this. The tattoo process sounds interesting. I guess I really never thought much about that part before. I hope I don't ever have too. Just had a lumpectomy & it if this comes back there won't be much to remove without taking it all. Dd's dancing & gymnastics sound like so much fun. I really miss those days with my boys. It passes so quickly, savor every moment you have. Has anyone had any problems with restless legs? For over 40 years I have occational bouts with the \"creepy-crawly\" legs when I went to bed. I would get up & find a different place to sleep, the couch, the recliner etc & usually go right to sleep. As I got older it would happen as little more often, maybe 4-5 times a month. But since I started chemo it has really escalated. Now I'm not just creepy, but my legs are flailing all over the place. Wakes me up about every 15-20 min. That's not a good nights sleep. 2 nights ago the longest I slept at any point was 2 hrs. I know there are Rxs out there but I've had enough medicine. Has anyone heard of any rub, exercise, herb.....anything that might help. They put a large rubber band around my feet during rads. I'm about to ask for one to tie up my feet when I go to bed. Well, looks like I beat the storms. They went south this time. But I have a few things to get done so better go while I still have the energy. Once again, thanks to everyone for being there and for posting so I have something to answer.",

We are going to Hoosier Park which started out as a horse track & this year opened with a casino too. My 1st real experience with gambling was last summer & fall. 1st at an Indian Casino in MI & then on the cruise. And dh took a trip to Vega$ with 2 of the ds before my cruise. We both really liked it. A friend is picking us up so since I'm not driving......           WooHoo Carol, sounds like you & dh are a match made in heaven. Those are always worth the wait. BTW have you tried olive oil. That is one of my standby methods of regularity. It's great on salad with some balsalmic vinegar or just do a shot of it. Kathy, groomed???? That's what I do to my cockers. You had a styling. I had a ds shave my neck last weekend. It feels good to have a hair line again. I would like some color too but don't think it's long enough yet. All that would color would be my scalp. Wouldn't that be cute. I glad you treated yourself today, we all need that once in a while. Congrats on the Relay for Life $$$. Julie, great pix. Thanks for sharing. I should take some at certain intervals for a future laugh. I love to scrapbook & this ordeal will surely get a few pages in the book of my life. D1, good luck on the RFTC tomorrow. I went down for ours in April, right before I fell in the hole & stopped posting. Walking thru those balloons - no describing it. My bff was with the 16-yr. group so I was at the back by myself. Not for long though. I hooked up with another single gal & we walked together, arms linked, smiling & crying at the same time. There are people out there who actually call us heros because we won our fight. It doesn't seem to me I had much to do with it, but maybe I did. Sat.6/6/08 Right here is where the power went off - again! Seems the fix from last weekend broke again. We got ready without ac or power to iron my outfit. Bff picked us up & we headed out for the casino. No sooner than we got there than there was an announcement that a tornado was on the grounds & we all had to move to the lower lever. OK, we won't eat, we will gamble. The next announcement said to \"Cease all gambling\" because of the lightning & electrical danger & to move to the inner hallways. They had us behind the scenes with the food freezers & storage units & that's where we stayed until the storm passed. There were 2 funnels out there, 1 on the ground & 1 still aloft. Since no one was hurt it was exciting. I'm going to post this now & then go back & try to find my place from last night. TTYL",

But tomorrow they are back again, heavy with potentially dangerous straight line winds. Oh Boy! I need to ask for prayers. My bff, the 16-yr. survivor, has a 27-yo son that did something stupid Mon. night. He mixed & took too many drugs and OD'ed. He is in a drug-induced coma & they can't say if he is brain dead or not. They had to lower his body temp to help save his organs & can't run a brain scan until they bring his temp back up. They tried that today & his bp kept dropping so they had to slow down the warming. So the scan which should have been run this AM won't be done until sometime tomorrow. In the mean time she just sits & waits. Yes, he was an idiot for doing the drugs, but that doesn't stop a mom from loving her son. And it doesn't stop me from loving him either. Please pray for God's Will to be done and that His Will won't force Melissa into the decision of whether on not to pull the plug. Sherry, hang in there. I've been thru my share of stress & depression. It will end and these gals here were a great big help. Let me speak from experience, don't try to catch up on all you missed.  While you're doing that you'll be getting behind on the new stuff.  I'm sorry to hear you are blistered. Sorry for you & worried for me. Today was rad #9 out of 33. I've been pretty good with my preventative skin care but I don't want to think about being burnt there. I'll remember your idea with the t-shirts & use it if I have to. I was wondering where the estrogen would come from since I don't have ovaries any more. If it's made in fat cells I'm a goner. Julie, I'm sorry the tears found you. I know what you mean by \"the look\" but for some strange reason it's not bothering me. Usually I'm very sensitive to being different or being looked at for any reason. Maybe it's this badge of courage thing. I have referred to my head as this ever since I lost my hair. Carol, I loved the new picture. You two sure look happy. I'm glad your weepies have gone. I think you sent them to me. My dil sent a copy of the letter Joey's 4K kindergarten teachers wrote to the kids. It was a tear jerker & made me start missing that little guy like crazy. And with the emotions over my bff's son, I'm a little sniffly. I had to call all 3 of my ds to tell them I loved them yesterday. OK, I have to ask, what is it about Tamox pill that has everyone up in arms? Am I missing something? It is really that hard to swallow or are you speaking metaphorically? I guess I haven't paid much attention to this drug because I won't start it until Jan. & it seemed like I had enough to pay attention to now. Kimberly, You should write professionally. I can see your ducklings as clearly as if I was there with you. Thanks for sharing. Kathy, Great pix. The luminaries almost made me cry again. I don't think I could have held the dove. I'm not good with birds, at least ones that flap. Once at Disney I was in an outdoor café. I was much skinnier then & was wearing a tank top. The birds were everywhere & I was freaking. But when one landed on the back of my chair & brushed my back with his wing it was all over. I jumped, screamed & ran out to the main walkway before I knew what I was doing. Can you say embarrassed? My ex-dh was shocked to say the least & finally said to all of the people staring at me \"You should see what she does when she sees a mouse.\" Not one of my finer moments. D1, Congrats to dd. I'd say a perfect score in anything is something to be proud of. I'll worry with you about doggie's dental appt. How old is she? Talk about being bad, we had a Spitz that had to have 14 teeth pulled because we didn't brush. But did that stop him from eating hard food or chewing rawhides - no way. I figured he'd be eating baby food the rest of his life. Yes, I'm topless all the time now. Great weather for it. I'm going to get some help with my weeds. Ds is on vaca next week & owes us some money. Dh arranged for him to come work some of the debt off & pulling weeds in on the list. I may get something pink planted this year yet. I better go see where we are going for dinner tonight.  Ya know I'm ready to start cooking again.  Can't believe I'm saying it but I'm fast-fooded out.",

I've got 8 more rad tx left.  3 regular & 5 boosts.  The skin above my collarbone is really dark & tender and I have several blisters that have popped.  Lots of green tea & cream there.  And my nipple feels like someone chopped the end of it off.  A gal at work suggested these \"gel pads\" nursing mothers use.  The gel is cool & comforting & it helps with the rubbing against clothes.  You can even put them in the fridge for extra cooling. My darling dgs, the 5-yr.old in Wisc., broke his arm last Wed.  It was his parents' 1st ER experience.  Lisa is hoping it will be the last.  I told her not to plan on it.  Nick got pulled over on his way to the hosp. but the nice cop let him go.  My bff's son may be a miracle in process.  Last Tues. the docs were talking to her about pulling the plug.  Wed. he opened his eyes & started responding to some verbal commands.  He is showing some improvement everyday.  It's still not good & would be a disaster if he plateaus here, but we are counting on this miracle to fulfill itself. I fell on my knee 2 weeks ago & it's still giving me trouble.  I may have to break down & go see someone.  At the end of the day the swelling is all the way down my leg, into my ankle & foot & my toes look like snausages.  Just when the water retention was going down.  The bruise goes from about 3\" above my knee into the arch of my foot.  But I can put weight on it without much pain so I really don't know what to do.  It's the swelling that has me worried. I'm going into work in the AM, going to rads & back to work without too much fatigue.  There may be a light at the end of this tunnel afterall. I have missed hearing from you gals & will go catch up.  TTYL",

So I'm going to try to send a few shout outs for the last couple of pages & then go back to reading. D1, I am very sorry your friend has lost his battle with the nasty disease.  I think it is more emotional (I'm not sure if that is the word I want) now when someone dies from cancer.  Before BC I had that feeling that it couldn't or wouldn't happen to me.  Can't say that now.  In fact it was a shock when I filled out a form for my knee doc & had to check the box that said I have had it. On a lighter note, maybe if you were \"hot\" in other places you wouldn't notice the hot flash so much. PALady, We give our dogs rawhides & have had no trouble.  I'm always careful to buy ones that were made in the USA.  I read that other countries use formaldehyde to process their rawhides.  And that's not good.  I'd warn you away from the colored ones.  They stain the dogs paws and any furniture or carpet they come in contact with.  Learned that the hard way. Sherry,  I have also been warned against every eating soybeans again.  It seems that anything that has been recommended to ease menopause  symptoms has been crossed off our list of things that are good for us. I like the dress and I like the shoes.  My suggestion would be to wear natural colored hose.  But that's just me & I've never been much of a fan of pastel ones.  The pearls are great but I agree on shortening them up some. Carol, Girl you make me exhausted with all that talk about walking.  I know I need to but I'm doing good if I make a half mile walk around town.  Hopefully I can improve once I get this knee straightened out. My onc put me on Femara.  Do check out their web page as there is a coupon for the 1st month free.  I stared last Fri. and as of today (a whopping 3 days) I can see no se. Maz, I am so sorry about your Dad.  My own Daddy died 3 ½ years ago.  We were very close.  I still miss him every day but I also can think of something good everyday & not cry.  People told me it would get better but I didn't believe them.  Then sometime when I wasn't looking I realized that I could look at his picture without that kicked in the gut feeling.  It all came back during this BC nightmare but it's getting better again.  Pray for help, remember the good times & continue to talk to him. Carla,  I wish my hair would stand up on top of my head.  I'm using gel & anything I can think of to try to spike it.  It just lays down as soon as I quit working with it.  My hair is NOT growing an inch a month.  I had it colored about 6 weeks ago & you can barely see my roots.  But it seems to be getting thicker. I am so sorry to hear about the personal stress you are going thru.  I will pray for you. LJ13, I like your charm.  I wondered if this was something I should do. Kimberly, I had to do exercises on that ball after my back surgery.  I called it the Devil Ball because I fell off every time I tried to use it.  I'm usually not that uncoordinated, but I made everyone in the PT room laugh every day. Diane63, that baby is gorgeous.  I remember the 1st time I held my 1st grandson.  He wasn't even an hour old.  It's a marvelous feeling isn't it. I'm sure I have missed some shout outs, but I've been interrupted several times. We celebrated last Thurs. as it was my LAST rad tx.  Couldn't come a minute too soon as 3 spots on my collarbone area were raw & weeping.  I was weeping too it was so painful.  Rad. Doc gave me a different cream & it did help the pain.  But I had trouble finding something to wear that doesn't rub.  Finally thought of putting non-stick bandage pads where the clothes met the raw skin.  Yesty I saw some improvement and today is wonderful.  I still know it is there, but it is so much better. I am finally seeing a doc for my knee.  It's been 5-6 weeks & it is still swelling.  Rad doc talked me into it.  I couldn't get in until tomorrow, made the appt 2 wks ago.  I was almost ready to cancel because I thought I saw an improvement.  Then last Mon. our office dog, this adorable Bassett Hound named Thumper, went blind in an instant.  When dh called me into the office where she was & I found out what was happening I knelt down on the floor to be with her.  Put weight on the bad knee & good night Irene.  I thought I was going to scream.  Now it's swelling so bad again & even starting to bruise again I'm glad I didn't cancel.  8:30 AM tomorrow.  Thumper means so much to me because I'm the one who office trained her & she laid on a pillow on my lap when she was a puppy while I worked.  Her owner is the son of the company owner.  He's 29 & I've known him since he was about 2.  He's like another son to me.  He took her to the vet & they did surgery right away.  But we won't know for about a month if she regains her sight again. Hair is very slow to come in.  Seems I got enough to cover my head & then it stopped.  I get compliments everywhere I go on my \"hair cut\".  When I explain that it's not on purpose everyone say I should keep it like this.  I'd like to have enough to roll around a small brush when I dry it.  The only exception to this hair situation is my legs.  I swear it's growing faster than before.  UGH!! I'm working full time again.  But come home & have to sit down & prop up the knee.  I'm beginning to feel normal again.  Someone said it would be a new normal & it is.  Especially mentally.  But it's not bad & I am getting used to it.  I have the knee doc tomorrow & Herceptin , rad doc on Thurs. & bone density test on the 28th.  But then I don't have to see anyone until the 14th of Aug.  I'm looking forward to that break. I gotta go.  Swelling is catching up with me.  I love you guys & miss you when I don't visit.",

Carol, so sorry to hear about your tummy. It's hard to believe you are chilly. It was 87 here today. You are right, this place is like a life line. I learn something everyday & find encouragement & bravery in every post. Congrats to dh for the promotion. How long did you guys date before you married? Sounds like at least 5 yrs. That's cool. Julie, I'm looking forward to hearing about ds & the open gym. All of my boys are tall, all between 6'4\" & 6'5\". The oldest wasn't very interested in sports & only was a bktball manager his jr. & sr. yr. I'm sure the coach wished he was more inclined to step onto the court. Cathy, now you have opened another question. What is a loganberry? I had at least heard of boysenberries before. How wonderful to have all of that fruit in your backyard. I hope to see Indiana Jones soon. If it's as good as the others I wouldn't mind seeing it again & again. Kimberly, congrats to your nurse/new mommy. I can't imagine the strain of being pg & having bc at the same time. I hope everything goes well for her from here on out. I envy your cleaning lady. I had one for a while that was one of Jon's acctg. clients. So she paid her bill by cleaning house so our part was too much money. Then some sort of budget crunch came along (probably one of our boys) & I gave her up. Never got anyone back since then. The little family owned company we work for has it perks, but on the down side we haven't had a raise in 7 yrs. Not much money in the budget for a cleaning lady these days. I totally support your decision on your treatment. I think I want everything they can throw at this but I can understand why you would choose differently. I think your onc should support your decision, agree to disagree.  You go girl! You have a grocery growing in your yard. How wonderful! I'll try the supplements you suggested. I did find something at CVS for RLS, homopathic (sp???). Took it last night & it seemed to help. But from about 2:00 I kept waking myself up snoring/gasping for breath because my sinuses were draining so bad. I know they say no rest for the wicked but I didn't think I was that bad. I just want a nights sleep. Good luck on your surgery tomorrow. I'm with you on going so long without food. If they cut off food at midnight when surgery is 6-7:00 am why can't they let you eat around 6:00 am if you in at 1:00? Never made sense to me. Paula, I know you & dh will fight with everything at hand. And you have a whole team of us here cheering & praying every step of the way. I think I am way past the normal pills for the RLS. I've tried Advil, Excedrin & Tylenol, regular & PM. I've taken a Xanax, and a sleeping pill (not at the same time) but no luck. I've tried wine, which was the most pleasant experiment but still no luck. D1, I wouldn't expect anything less than TMI from you. But you spice it up so good I never think it's TMI. Can you imagine if your dh & I would try to take on a painting project together. It would NEVER finish. LOL If you keep feeding those painters with yummy treats they will never finish. It never hurts to keep the help happy. I had rad #4 today. It's still a breeze. Takes me longer to get that cute little pink top on than it takes to \u2018shoot' me. They say I have another week before the burn starts. I don't remember reading how anyone else is doing. I am spraying strong green tea on the rad area followed by a Rx cream 4 times a day. She had me start the 1st day, before the burn begins. Another step in my reclaiming my life - I started using shampoo. It may only be 1/4\" long but it's hair & it deserves shampoo. Haven't gone for the conditioner yet but for some reason it made me feel good to use the shampoo. I better go & help dh with dinner. Then back to the \u2018puter to pay bills. We both get paid once a month & today was it. I don't remember who had trouble with chemo brain & ebill pmt but I can sympathize. Not too long ago I transferred money from my mom's ck. acct. instead of taking it from our secondary acct. OOPS! Here's to all of our health, healing & strength. We Are Women, Hear Us Roar! (If you are too young to remember that in the singular, please don't tell me)",

Maybe that life afterwards is not so far off afterall. Carla, Congrats on your last tx. You've come a long way Baby! Good luck with your booth at the Relay. I hope you aren't having the same rainy day we are. Kimberly, so good to know at least 1 person here has heard of Helen. When I quoted that line at work the gals just looked at me like I was crazy. I'm sure it did feel good to clean your school room. And when you go back it will be your room again. Yes, this stuff does have magnesium & some other things I can't pronounce. But my pharm. looked at it & said it was all natural & shouldn't cause any problems. I really slept good last but maybe because it was so late & I was really pooped. Carol, good for you! Enough said! Tina, congrats to you & your ds. They had a lock-in after prom when my oldest graduated. He volunteered me to chaperone. And who was one of the last seniors to arrive, you got it, him & his date. It was fun & I miss those days. The pix of ds#2 is great. I can't imagine losing a child. Those who have survived a tragedy like that must have suffered so much pain. You 2 look so much alike. And you look so happy & proud. Sounds like ds #1 has a great adventure ahead of him. Oh no, here come the storms again. I'm off the \u2018puter & will finish later.",

The rest of the weekend was uneventful, but yesterday was major! I got my hair colored. It looked SO bad, really dark & really grey. I've always had some help but you can see from the picture that I'm basically a blonde. This salt & pepper cr@p was for the birds. My hairdresser is my bff we went to the casino with & when we got into the car she announced it was time for color. I could have kissed her! So last night we had another \u2018date' & went to her house for hamburgers, corn, pot salad & hair color. I feel so much better. Every little piece of the puzzle we put back together is so good! Julie, your backyard sounds lovely. And all of that help. My dh isn't much on flower beds etc. so if any weeding is to be done, I'm the one. And this year the weeds are winning. Carol, your endless energy never ceases to amaze me. Where do you get it? I didn't have that much before bc. Congrats on your last tx! It's great to have that mountain behind us. I went into the chemo room today to have blood drawn from my port. Once I was there I realized that I didn't have that feeling of dread like I did when I watch the poison pump into my veins, knowing what was coming in a few days. NO to everyone, I didn't win anything. But I had a lot of fun and towards the end of the evening I made $4 last over 2 hours before I lost it. And there is always next time. Kathy, your event sounds wonderful. And very moving. I'm sure there were lots of tears to be found right along side the laughter. Kimberly, how great to be done! Being only about half way thru I can't imagine how it will feel to be free of the daily/weekly appts. You should have heard my WooHoo all the way to Calif. Your poem is good! You really should do this for a living. And I loved the reference to Helen Reddy! Thanks for the positive thoughts on me & dh. D1, you're not only our leader but a world traveler. How wonderful! I got to Germany, England, France & Switzerland with my exdh and I know what you mean feeling guilty we only speak 1 language. I learned a little German in prep for my 1st trip there. I learned to ask for the ladies room so well the 1st time I used it they guy answered me in German. Must have thought I could understand him. Well I didn't & ended up in the men's room. OOPS! Dh is rather a homebody, probably due to his failing eyesight, but I don't think I'll be going anywhere great anymore. Good for you & the study and having to experience the needle to do it is even better. Maz, What a great picture. What a nice looking son. So good to hear that he is doing well. We don't hear enough about the success stories. Those need to be shouted out from the rooftops. Dinner is in the oven & I better wrap this up.  I pray that everyone is feeling better each day.  Love & hugs to everyone of you.",

This is the longest spell of nice weather we have had all year. It will probably wait for the weekend because I want to plant some flowers in my newly weeded flower gardens. I ran in circles today. Rads in the AM at the north clinic & a MUGA in the PM at the east clinic. Not enough time to go back to work in the middle (wasn't that a shame) so I went to JoAnns to browse & the sweeper store for bags. Walked into the mall's food court for some Teriyaki chicken (yum) & then headed for the other clinic for the MUGA. I almost fell asleep on the table I was so pooped. And I'm the one who is afraid to sleep in public. Carol, I think the idea of the collage is great. See if you can email the .jpg to me when you get it done. The vino does sound good, think I will pour myself a glass while I read & post. Kimberly, sounds like you have a wonderful doc. I'm glad he is encouraging your medical decisions. Ya know, after your periods are gone for a while, you forget all about having them. But listening to you guys these past few months, I am really glad all of that was over before I declared war on bc. My supervisor at work is my dh so yes he understands what is going on. It's just that the whole place is in turmoil because of the new software and the in-family fighting between the owner & 2 of his kids who want to take over the business. And they \u2018retired' our shop foreman a year & a half ago & haven't been able to find anyone who can run the shop like he could. The son thought it was so easy he could do it himself. NOT! And one of the gals that needs to be fired is the daughter. It's a mess. I just have to hang in there until \"I'm myself again\" & get everything back in order. It's just that I'm ready to go back to work & yet I hate the shape of the office & the conditions in which I must work. Let's hope your boss is wanting to upset the schedule. Have fun in Chicago and enjoy \u2018Wicked'. D1, my rad nurse told me that if you had had anything wrong with the arm on the same side as the bc, the rad would cause it to flare up again. I'd say your rotator cuff falls into that catagory. You are too good, pointing out the nurse's flaws. I don't know if I could have been that quick witted. Cathy, congrats on your son's graduation. Those are always hectic, yet fun times. I hope that the situation with your other son gets resolved in a positive way. WhooHoo on being almost done with rads. My calendar date sure looks pretty far out there. Please let me know if the estrogen cream helps. I miss my libido. PALady, put my dh on the list with yours. He isn't able to talk about my bc, either the present or the future. When I was so terribly tired on chemo I think it kinda rolled off of me. And I was too tired to talk anyway. But now I'm feeling better & if I try to talk to him it like talking to a brick wall. Just no response at all. I know it is bothering him & if we could talk it out he might feel better. It's funny too because we used to be able to talk about anything & everything. Carry on real conversations with 2 people participating. It was changing b4 bc but has been worse since then. We did have fun with the squirt guns. I wish I had been up & running around but got several good hits in from my deck chair. I've never been a runner but do have oa in both knees & have had surgery on both. They have hurt much more than normal since the chemo. My last tx was May 1st & I would think I would be seeing an improvement by now. Well, dh is ready to grill some burgers & I need to do the condiments & strawberries. I told you gals you got me started on them.",

PALady, I'm with you.  Haven't given up the coffee thing at any time except the AM B4 surgery.  If I didn't keep pumping it in on Thurs. I wouldn't stay awake with the Benedryl. Vettegal, Thanks for sharing the card verse.  That was great.  I wonder if she wrote it herself or found it somewhere.  There is a great poem on the wall of the chemo room.  It's pretty long to try to copy down but I may try to take a pix of it.  You all need to read it. Here's to everyone tht may spend the weekend down & out with SEs.  Last weekend was my turn & I'm glad to have a couple of good ones coming up. CarolC,  The description of you at the office was enough to give me the giggles.  I have had periphreal neuropathy before & know how painful it is.  I took the same med you have & had really good luck with it.  My dh had neck (spine) surgery last year & has some lasting neuropathy from that.  He takes this med & it's helped him too.  I hope it works for you. D1, I hear you about having family under 1 roof.  3 sons, 1 daughter-in-law & 1 grandson live in Milwaukee.  It's a rare treat that I get them all under my roof.  And, yes, it's heaven just to sit on the sidelines & listen to them.  It's pretty good when I go up there to visit, but then I'm missing dh & 4th son & 2nd grandson.  Just can't seem to get the whole puzzle put together at once. I will agree with you all on the watery eyes & runny nose.  I did remember some prescrip. eye drops I had for dry eyes & contacts.  I tried some today & got some relief.  I've tried my contacts a few times but my eyes seem so dry (even though they are watering. Go Figure) that I can't wear them for long.  One day it got so dry it folded over & popped out. Question for anyone who had a bunch of lumph nodes removed.  My arm is not recovering very well.  Any suggestions on exercises I can do to strengthen it?  I really noticed it today when I tried to put in the eye drops.  And my writing doesn't look like it used to.  I can't even read it the next day.  I know my surgeon would send me to therapy but I just don't want to go.  Going to tx once a week is enough.  If I can do it by myself I want to. Another question for all of you...  When do we consider ourselves cured?  When do we become a survivor?  Was it the day of surgery, when they supposedly took it all out?  Or when our treatment ends?  You hear of people saying they are a so-many-year survivor, when do we  celebrate that 1st year?  My friend considers it the day of her mastectomy, but I wondered what you thought. Best go see what dh is doing, it's been awfully quiet for a long time.  And I want to watch Celine Dion on CBS tonight.  I love her voice, I would love to be able to sing.  Sweet dreams all of you Jewels.  May your se be mild & your dreams be wild.  (See I can rhyme too)",

This also helps remembering what to write. I'm such a happy camper right now. Doesn't take much to please me does it? Julie, I think I started my \u2018lost' post by asking you to stop sending your weather to Indiana. It's snowing again, don't know how much but it's going to blow & drift and I'm sick of this! KathyL, your kids are adorable. I can't imagine going thru this while trying to take care of them, but you seem to be finding the strength somewhere. I'm sure they do plenty to make you smile. Just hold those thoughts in your mind's eye when they are giving you trouble. Vettegal, I love your hat! My cousin just sent me a cap covered with pink sequins. Wild, but fun. I'm going to wear it to work next week & maybe to the Race for the Cure. Ours here in Indianapolis is one of the biggest across the country. It's mid-April. I had been going for the last few years with my bf Melissa (16-years & still going strong!) Didn't have any idea that one day I would walk for myself as well as her. It's the 2nd weekend after tx so I may not make the walk, but I will be there cheering everyone else on. Or I may try the 1-mile version. Carol, If I read your post correctly we are both ½ way thru. At least with the chemo anyway. Yahoo! Dana, I have a port & consider it one of the world's greatest inventions. D1, I can't imagine you putting up with a less than great doc. You go out & find someone a little more competent. OK, now I'm going to read recent posts & see what else needs attention. Julie, I can't believe you aren't free to walk around or have visitors. I'm getting to know some of the guests as well as the patients. We don't have many places to go except the chemo room, not like Dana's walk, but I can go down the hall to a different restroom or do laps around the room. Or go to the snack table by the long way. Cathy, You make me tired just reading you plans. Russian History.....is that a class you are taking by choice? D1 & Tinalee, I'm with you on the arm thing. When I realized I couldn't put drops in my eye I knew I had to do something. My wonderful sis-in-law heads the PT dept. of a local hospital. She has a breast cancer specialist on staff. She is starting to have the spec. train some other PT's in bc care. She needed a bc patient for them to train on. Guess what! I'm getting the treatments for free & they are thanking me for letting them work on me. I met with the whole group on Wed. & the spec. taught the other how to do an eval for bc. Next week I get a 1 on 1 with the teacher & 1 student. This is a huge blessing that I can't believe just fell into my lap. I didn't know there were special pts who saw bc people. Anyone needing some pt might with their local cancer center to see if there is one in your area. D1, You dream sounds very unnerving. Do you know anyone who looks like her or dresses like her? Now your new doc on the other hand sounds quite nice. I'm looking at the same rad schedule as you & w/ln involvement will probably have the same se. I'm almost dreading this more than the chemo. If rads make me tired & I'm already tired from the chemo....I just don't know. But we have to do what we have to do. I know I'm not caught up yet, but this is getting long. I'm going to go eat & try to finish tomorrow. My wish is that everyone is feeling as well as I am right now. Sweet dreams, especially you D1.",

The tech asked me if I had \u2018anything' on my left side. He named off breast implants, scar tissue & a few other things. No to all. Then he asked if I still had the lower lobe of my left lung. YES! I asked what was going on & he said he saw a shadow between my pancreas & my left ventricle. He pulled up my old MUGA & said it was there before but not as defined. OK what is it? He tried to make light of it, but of course that didn't work. Now I'm stuck until tomorrow or Wed to get the report from the onc. I haven't told anyone but dh & he's scared too. It's impossible to find anything on the web about a shadow on a MUGA scan. Believe me I tried. I guess since I'm afraid to tell my kids I had to tell someone. Let me know if any of you have heard of anything like this & I'll let you know as soon as I talk to the onc. Now to the fun stuff! Dana, I am also eating like I'm at a buffet. Even when I'm a little nauseous I feel I need something to eat. Usually then it is salty I want. But the other days I seem to switch back & forth between sweet & salt. Glad to have company in this area. Carol, glad ds teacher did some refining to his grade. I would feel sorry for him is he got the low grade but didn't deserve. I took away driving to school privileges from one of my boys his senior year. At least until the grades came back up. Never saw him study so hard & ask to have teachers give him a mid-term grade as he did to get his keys back. Oh the joy of having something really important to hold over their heads. Happy Belated Birthday! Sorry I missed the date. I am sooooo glad you caught the olive oil in time. I love oo, but not in my sweets. I get shivers just thinking about it. I go this Wed. For my 1st real pt session. Last week was more of an eval. I have been doing the exer. She showed me but haven't noticed much of a diff yet. KathyL, I admire the energy you have. What a Friday! Sounds like fun. You know we all talk about the days our kids leave home & looking forward to it etc. But you will miss them. I pass a mom in the grocery with a little one in the basket & remember the days. I always tried to make the store a fun trip for them & let them choose some of the food. Shopping is boring now. And Easter, Christmas, birthdays just aren't as much fun when your planning for adults. The cute little things you bought for baskets don't cut it for 30-year olds. In case you missed it my birthday is Jan. 28th. And as I've been watching, I think I may be the oldest Jewel in this crown at 57. Anyone older is more than welcome to shout out. Thank you so much for the horse story. It's so true. I can look back to a time when some of my friends leaned on me & now it is my turn to lean of them. And a true story, my parents had 2 dachshunds, the older one went blind. The younger one, Princess, would lead Gypsy through the house by backing up so her rear touched Gypsy's nose. Princess would start for the food, or the door, or bed & stop after a few steps until Gypsy caught up. It was priceless to watch them. Vettegal, I think the only person offended by my shirt is my mom and she's a grouchy old prude anyway. Even my onc got a laugh out of it. He said he usually tried not to use language like that around his patients but this case was worth the exception. I am so sorry you had another reaction. At least they were ready to help right away, but that has to be unnerving. Hang in there you are going to beat this nasty thing. I'm sorry to hear your mom is still fighting the battle. That's not something a mother & daughter want to do together. But you also must feel an inspiration seeing how long she has been a survivor. D1, I agree that the fatigue is accumulative. I thought I was ok to drive last Sun. I was stopped at a stop light (I thought) when dh asked why I was stopped. There wasn't a stop light, not even a stop sign for my street. I know the people around me thought I was nuts. I drove much more carefully after that. Remember dh can't drive because he's legally blind & he could see there wasn't a light. Wvgal, I love the pens in the dw story. Now I don't feel so bad putting the mail in the oven & an individual cup of applesauce in my purse. Can you imagine if something had punctured the foil top in the bottom of my purse? Cathy, Well, that makes sense. That trip sounds fantastic! It's great too that you & your mom can enjoy things like that together. I wasn't a history fan in school & did what I needed to get by. I really missed that knowledge when I went to Germany a few years ago. I came back & read a lot but it should have been read beforehand. I find I enjoy learning so much more now, & in the past several years, than I did in school. It's a shame. Tinalee, I don't know how to judge my ROM but I can't hold my arm up to put on deoderant. I have to rest it on my head. And in that same area it a bi#ch to get eye drops in. I still have swelling on my side right under my arm & numbness. The PT was pleased with my ROM but said there was some work to do. My surgery was 12/20 & they removed 30+ ln which everyone seems to think is a lot. I'll let you know what they say. Paula, I think a book would be a great idea. I think I could come up with a story or 2. One anyway about how my pets have reacted to me. I know they know. Sweet dreams & mild se to all",

So is dh to a point. Probably my attitude. Then I end up in the chair gasping for breath & aching all over again. By the time I'm done with chemo I will probably have all of this down pat. I have been taking Taxotere since Jan. and haven't had too much of a problem with neuropathy. I know I'm lucky there because I had a real bout with it a few years ago. I was afraid the T would get it started again, but so far so good. Vettegal, I am so sorry to hear about your sis's results. At least she will have a wonderful path to follow. The one you have already started. I hope she opens up to you, for both of your sakes. It is very hard when someone we love won't take the help & support we need to give them. I have dealt with the \u2018blah' taste in my mouth thru most of this. It seems to come & go. Some days things taste good, some days they don't. (Almond Joy/Mounds jingle is bouncing in my head) And I can't find anything to help. The biotene helps with the sore mouth but has such a yucky taste itself it doesn't do any good. Funny how one day sweet tastes good & another it will be sweet. And I can find no pattern. Just why is it you get comped at Planet Hollywood? Is that when you lose a lot or win? I've only been in a casino twice, both last year. Once in MI on an Indian reservation & once on the cruise with gfs this Oct. Loved it! Must do it again! We have some river boats in the southern part of IN but what I really want is to go back on another cruise. Heaven!!!! D1, Your comment about arm hair made me look. I still have some, but not nearly as much as before. I have 1 strip down the inside of each calf that grows very slowly. This is all so very weird. Paula, You remind me of the things I used to do to my boys when they were younger & we would be out. I loved to try to trick them down the \"feminine products aisle\" of a new grocery. We would play toss the can to ds, who tossed it to other ds who put it the basket. But when the can of corn became a box of pads, all h*ll broke loose. They played hot potato & it usually ended up on the floor. I know people thought we were crazy, but we had fun. I have not used all of my energy but I really should put in an hour or so of work. End of the month is coming up & I have to get some things balanced out. And I think it is time to graze again. I'm thinking wonderful thoughts for all of you & your loved ones. Hugs & Love.",

I can't wait to hear about your rad experience.  And tell me, did the tats hurt?  That shouldn't be a concern after everything else, but I can't stop thinking about it.  Maybe it's because that boob is still so sore.  The part he removed was about 3\" x 2.5\" right under my nipple.  The incision doesn't hurt but I will get stabbing like pains deep in my breast.  And my nipple is almost always sore.  Where else on the face of the earth could I write questions like this?  But I know you guys understand.  Anyway the whole area is so tender I don't want to think of tats. I don't know if the frz. Marg. cooled my mouth or if the tequila numbed it but it worked! KathyL, Don't fret the tears.  I got \u2018em when my dgs moved to a bb bed.  The kids sent me a cell phone picture & I almost started crying in WalMart.  My ds is particularly fond of sending me pix on the phone.  I even got one the 1st time Joey went poopy in the potty.  And it wasn't a pix of Joey sitting there.  Oh no this pix was taken after he was done.  This time I laughed till I cried. I had my 1 day of sun on Sat.  Now they are predicting rain for the next 10 days. SisKimberly, I talk to my dad all of the time.  I am like him in so many ways, so many of my interests are the same, I'm always asking for advise.  But he gave the best hugs. Isn't it sad that we get cheered up because we feel like cleaning the bathroom? I didn't do very much productive things after I signed off though. I stumbled across the movies on USA & kind of got lost in them. 50 First Dates was on, then How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days & finally Bruce Almighty. The 1st 2 I hadn't seen & Bruce....well I'll watch that one over & over. Julie, Good to see you felt like saying \u2018hi'.  I envy you your naps.  It seems when I feel the worse right after a tx I can't take naps.  And I've always been a nap taker.  I miss them. Well, I best go see what dh wants for dinner.  I want to have everything done & out of the way in time for Dancing.  I worked 1/2 a day today & can really feel it.  Hugs & Love & mini se to you all.",

Good luck wig shopping everyone.  My good friend since Jr.High, 16-year BC Survivor, is also my hair dresser.  She got a wig catalog from a company she uses all the time & we picked out one already.  Chose one a little longer than my style so she can trim it up.  If I don't lose it all at once she will shave me when I get ugly.  I also found really nice, inexpensive, pre-tied scarves on EBay.  Search \"Chemo Scarves\".  She also advised me to not get shiny, slick scarves.  Says they come untied easy & like to slip off.  Wouldn't that be a shock in the Wal-Mart line.

DI you Rock Girl!  I love the pix!  I took a camera yesterday but forgot to have rn take me & DH & bags of glory. Everyone, i'm thinking of you but have to go back to recliner. hugs to all.",

Paula, I can really sympathize about your driving situation & dh.  Mine is legally blind & can't drive.  I know it makes him feel really bad when he can't go do things for me, to ask for help or see me drive when I really don't feel like it. I hear my wig is here.  Must go see it soon in case it's not right & she has to exchange it.  BF, BC survivot & hair dresser cut my hair yesterday.  It was so long it wasn't me.  By the time I got it dry my arm couldn't style it.  Is anyone else still having surgery discomfort?  My was 12/20 & he removed 28 LN.  Anyway that 2 hr. outing was all for the day.  Today is going to be quiet.  Maybe I can make it a couple of hours at work tomorrow.  We'll see. I am thinking of all of you & send up prayers as I read your posts.  But the shakes are back & my chair is calling.  Good luck to everyone with whatever you are doing this coming week.  I love it that you are all here.",

Carol, I forgot to mention the eng.ring last post.  Your future SIL sounds great to be so sentimental.  And to have listened to know this ring would have special meaning to her.  She's got a keeper. WVGirl, I am so happy your DH (I mean capitals) is coming around.  I can't imagine not having my dh's support.  Maybe it was his way of dealing with the fear of losing you.  Guys sure have a weird way of expressing their emotions at times.  I'll continue to pray that things smooth out for you two. Julie, I'm sorry you will be down this weekend, but envy your being able to sleep.  During the worst of the post-semi-truck collision days I can't sleep or even nap.  And I have always treasured my naps.  The time goes really slow when you are too tired to hold a book but can't sleep the se away. Deb,  I'm a scrapbooker & have planned on making one too.  I've received some of the cutest cards & notes & the inspirations and funnies from you gals.  It will entertain me to make it & who knows maybe someone will look at it years from now & gather some inspiration.  Or better yet, be amazed at what we had to go thru to beat this monster because there will be no more bc in the future. Deb & Cathy,  Thanks for the date answer.  That means my anniversary date will come 1 week sooner than if I used my surgery date.  Sounds good to me! PALady,  Thanks for the exercise tip.  I will check it out as soon as I post. Vettegal,  That reaction during your tx is awful.  And I'm sure very scary for you.  I'm sending prayers for you this weekend. Well, it's time to make a grocery list.  We are running out of food & staples so dh & I will make a trip to the store.  If it would just warm up a bit, it's 20 out there now.  I'll check in on you gals later.  Those of you with se, take it east & rest.  Think of how you will feel next weekend.  Those of you without se, go play, enjoy the good weekend while it lasts.  Love & Hugs to you all.",

He's probably just a bit scatter-brained from wearing that lead vest all the time. I plan on forgetting about the weird thing on the MUGA. My ds, dd-i-l, & dgs will be here tomorrow night & will stay thru Sun. They live in Milwaukee & I haven't seen them since Christmas. They will cheer me up like nothing in the world. I'm sure when they are gone I will collapse but it will be worth it. And just when do we get to see a pix of you? Almost everyone else has come thru. You are our leader, we need to see you! KathyL, All of my blood tests have been great. He's going to have to look somewhere else to find the cause. Go buy yourself some new makeup. Try a different eye shadow. Try liner if you don't already use it. My bf told me to spend the time I gained by not having hair with a little extra effort on the makeup. I have to admit it makes me feel better. SisKimberly, I think you Oprah idea is great. We could all wear our t-shirts. We would be great advocates for this web site too. If we all emailed her we might catch the attention of one of her producers. Carol. I can totally appreciate your dilemma whether to take or not to take the Miralax. The 1st time I think I took too much & went from dammed up to open the flood gates in about 30 minutes. So the 2nd time I didn't take as much & paid for it. This time has been pretty even & I think part of the credit goes to lots of salads with olive oil. After the 1st couple of days I felt I didn't need the mir. About the dogs, I couldn't live without one. And yes 2 is as easy of 1 & so much company for each other. I'll work on getting a pix up here. I have always gone with my babies when it was their time. I wanted the last thing they know to be my touch. Have you read the rainbow's bridge poem? I'm sure you have. I've worked one up with a rainbow background & can put any pets pix, name & dates on it. It prints up to 8 x10. If anyone out there wants one PM me & I give you my email. I can email the print back to you & you can save it on CD & take it anywhere to print. For those not really computer savy I'll print it & snail mail it to you. I have a really good photo printer. Paula, Your ds is such a cutie even with the long hair. I gave up with my boys & said as long as it was clean & tidy I didn't care. We have gone thru the mullets, shaved heads, braids, you name it and now that they are men, they are all sensible. Are you sure you aren't jealous that he has more than you. Tee hee! I think you look great! dh has called dinner.  I better go.  Love & Hugs to you all.",

I hope everything goes well for him. I just read your bc story & feel so sorry for the ordeal you had. But you sound strong now and I am sure you are going to beat this thing. Just like we all are. DI, I loved your reference to bm. One of them I Want & the other I Need. You guess which is which. I did sneak a drink while out to dinner with the kids Fri. Night. I had a frozen margarita & it was wonderful. I'm with you on the Beatles & the Eagles, FW Mac is OK too, but you can keep PF. Now if I had to choose one artist to take to the deserted island with me it would Neil Diamond. I get all wiggly just thinking about him. You dh is wonderful. Aren't the nicest surprises the ones that come out of the blue. No birthday or other celebration that required a gift. Just a little \"I'm thinking of you\" present. Those earrings sound fabulous. I'm addicted to gem stones. I think topaz has the most beautiful range of colors. And thanks for the picture. You don't look old enough to be mother to those girls. I bet people often mistake you for sisters. I didn't like it much when it happened to me & my mother, but then we are talking about my mother. But I was in 7th heaven when someone thought my oldest, Nick, was my brother. You have one beautiful looking family. I'm sure you found a way to make it up to him after blowing him off while dealing with the pix. I find myself doing that on occasion with mine too. He does so much for me, he did before & he does even more now. But we do butt heads on conversation time once in a while. If I want to talk, he's into something. Then when he's done, I'm involved. Men! Sorry to hear about your mom's arm. It seems lots of us are having other complications in our lives this week. I'm crossing my fingers that my small group stay healthy. Don't feel bad about your dd's arm. My mom waited 2 ½ days to take me in when I broke my foot. She thought I was exaggerating about the pain. Yes, you can break a bone & not have swelling. She felt really bad but I still give her a hard time about it. To all of you Packer Fans out there: My eldest ds is a huge fan & was devastated when Brett retired. And after living in Milw. for 7 years the Pack is my 2nd fav. team to the Colts of course. Deanna Favre has a great, inspiration book out about her fight with bc. My kids gave it to me for my b-day & I recommend it to all of you. And I must have missed the post...what is the book you are all talking about? Paula, I'm with you on those Pantene ads. Hair color ones are just as bad. But I am very comfortable in my baldness. I love it. I bet I end up keeping my hair even shorter than before when it does start coming back. I'm so sorry that your dh's seizure kept you from the ball game. You are pulling double duty, my friend. Taking care of your dh & yourself. And seizures are so unpredictable, that in itself is a constant strain. KathyL, So I'm not the only one with head zits! I've been putting Clearasil on them. I also have for recurring ones on my face. 2 on 1 side of my nose, 1 on the other & 1 right in the middle of my nose. I think they are gone and wham! they come back. Haven't had this trouble since my teenage years. Get that makeup out & have some fun. Add me to your list for Thurs. full dose of the chemotini. Vettegal, I'm sure as I read on I will hear the news about your sis. Man, that is too much to take. I hope things work out for both of you. Tina, Your story of meeting your dh could be mine. When we 1st met we were both married, neither happily. He became my best friend. I could talk to him about anything. When I reached the end of my rope with my marriage I got a divorce. He was still married and though I knew he was my true love I also knew I couldn't have him. I made another romantic connection & moved from Indianapolis to Milwaukee & got married again. BIG MISTAKE! Running from someone you can't have is no way to find another relationship. We lasted 7 years and my oldest, Nick did find the love of his live. When that was over I came back to IN & started talking to dh again. He still worked at the same place & I had gf there so it was natural I'd stop by the office. The rest is history. And now I'm back working there again & it's great. Especially once he lost his license. I think I know how I got bc. Our junior high was being renovated when we were there & the asbestos dust was so thick you couldn't see from one end of the hall to the other. Out of a group of about 10 of us that have stayed in touch we have 1 death from bc, 3 survivors & 2 with benign tumors. We are sure the asbestos had something to do with it. My family dr. believed us & started me on mammos when I was 35. And my surgeon said while there was no research into that it would be a wonderful thesis for a student dr. We have a reunion coming up in a year & we are going to survey for more cases. Dana, You hit the nail on the head with the greetings we get from our dogs when we come home. I even have 1 cat that comes running in to see me. And they look at you with such adoring eyes. I really feel sorry for anyone that doesn't appreciate a pet like that. You hang on to those dogs, they are truly your now. Kimberly, I'm not real impressed with your info on chemo brain & fatigue. I'm not looking forward to thinking & feeling like this any longer than necessary.   I'm starting to really scare myself with some of the things I forget or can't do right anymore. You are making this Oprah thing even more inviting. I'm sure we all would appreciate a make-over by that time. I really think her show would be interested. Every one I've talked to about this group thinks it is a wonderful idea. And there is no way I can describe just how good it feels to be here, learning & sharing with each other. Carol, What a super brother! He's come thru with something sweet before this hasn't he. You are lucky. I'm an only child & miss siblings more now than I did when I was young. I sure have to vote for mammos. Mine showed the calcifications & caught it in very early stages. And with it being one of the agressive forms I hate to think of how big it might have gotten before I felt it. I know who you mean & 2nd your vote for our Oprah correspondent. But I also think after her 1st letter we all should write in. Give them the full effect of our support for each other. Just for the record, when I was in jr/sr hs I had a poodle, a dachshund & 2 cats. When they were all playing it was wild, but when they got tired they all piled up together & fell asleep. And now we have 2 dogs & 3 cats. I love the interaction between them. Therese, My fingers have been swelling for a week or so & yesterday my feet were really bad. I thought it was because I walked all weekend with my kids. But combined with the breathlessness and the \u2018what ever it is' on my MUGA I was getting worried about something serious. I take Taxotere so maybe that is all it is. I see the onc this Thurs & hopefully he can explain everything away. I'll be watching for you at the end of the tunnel. It is a true blessing we are here to push & pull each other thru this. Julie, Did you call your dr? Passing out is not good. I used to have migraines all the time, b4 my hyster. I know it's easy to forget what you have taken. Do you think you took too many meds? If you can't explain this I really think you should mention it to someone. How are you going to post to us if you are passed out on the living room floor? I'm glad you felt like soaking up some sun today. I hope you will send some of it my way. Earlier today the weather girl said it would be sunny today. It's 5:22 & I'm just now seeing some brightness in the sky. WOW! What a bunch of coworkers. You are truly blessed to have friends like that. Some day you will be given the chance to pay it forward. So enjoy this blessing. Tinalee, You are beautiful in your baldness. And I love your Queen. At the moment mine is on the desk next to me, but she takes turns walking on the keyboard or draped around my neck watching the cursor move across the screen. The only time cats do what they are told is when they thought of it first. I'm sorry this has been so long, but I haven't even turned on the comp since my kids got here Thurs. evening. We had such a good visit. Joey, my dgs, wasn't at all put off by my head. And Nick had shaved his to match. That's the picture I'm trying to post, of me & Nick with our heads together. Thanks Julie, but you tip didn't work. I've tried pasting the IMG link right on the doc & clicking the insert image button & pasting it there. No matter what I do I just get the url address not the picture. This is frustrating because I work with digital pix all the time & have never had a problem. I'll keep trying. In the meantime, enjoy the rest of your Sun.",

I'm in for the big drink tomorrow so may be lurking for a couple of days. I'm dreading this one, not sure why. Hey Deb102307, I'm getting my 4th Chemotini tomorrow including Taxotere. The fatigue & aches are my main se. But I have to say it's getting a bit worse each time. Usually I'm really rested & ready to go buy the time the next tx rolls around. This time I don't think I am back to normal & here I go again. Not looking forward to this one. I seem to have 2 Chemoangels too. Both have sent letters describing themselves & the sweetest cards & gifts. I recommend to all. Everyone needs a pick me up once in a while. D1 & any other Puffy Pals, Count me in also. I'm going to ask onc. tom. about it. Haven't been able to wear my rings for about 3 wks. & feet-what's fatter than sausage. It's going up my legs too. Add this to my ongoing breathlessness & I'm a little concerned. Don't want to make a big deal or anything but....... I have had bladder problems for a long time. Take a pill for an overactive bladder. The Poise are really good. More of a pad than panty. I haven't noticed it being any worse, but now sure it could be. Just wait, you will tell you gyn & he/she will send you to a urologist. Tell the tale 1 more time. I don't think we are entitled to any modesty any more. I didn't think a thing of baring the scars for the pt class. Of course it was all women! I think I would let someone see that nail. Yu sure don't want to get a fungal infec. under that nail. SISKimberly, I loved your description of the moors. And it does fit the feeling after a tx. I'm going to have to remember that. And the Mound jingle, you have me rolling girl. I think you should definitely be in on the formation of our Oprah letter. Your talent with the words catches everyones' attention. I'm sorry about your infection. Really glad you called when you did. A good reminder to all of us that it's better to be safe than sorry. Carol, I hope you enjoy Deanna's book as much as I did. She is a very spiritual woman with an amazing outlook on life. I'm with you on the Reunion. Anywhere as long as we can give real hugs. I'm a \"Dancing..\" fan too but didn't think I had mentioned it. dh actually watched with me this time. Right now I'm liking Jason Taylor & Steve G (he really surprised me) and Kristie & Marlie. How she does it I don't know. Wish I'd been there with a camera for your intervention with the bird feeder. Think Someone was telling you to take it easy? Julie, Your day at school sounds great! It does feel good to get out among the normal again. I'm lucky that I'm only 3 miles from work & can go in as I feel like it. The girls hate it cause I start finding mistakes or things that should be done. But also when I work from home I'm the email queen. But we really miss each other & lately spend more time catching up than working. Good thing my dh is out boss. SheShe 48, Maybe I missed it b4. Planning a wedding, sounds like so much fun. Having 3 sons I didn't get in on much of the planning. And I had moved back to IN from WI where the happy couple live so that didn't help. I do have to share a wonderful story. At the wedding of my son's best friend, the friend walked his mother to her seat. I thought that was such a beautiful gesture I put in the back of my mind for later. I mentioned it to Nick when he got engaged & he remembered & wanted to do it. His future mil said \"NO\". It wasn't proper for the groom to be seen before the ceremony. I was devastated. I had already given in to lighting a candle with his dad, my ex, even though I couldn't stand to be in the same room with him. I had given in to sitting next to him during the ceremony. I offered to sit in the 2nd pew but again Nick's mil said \u2018NO\". So imagine my surprise when, at the rehersal, the minister said \"Nick, it will be at this time you walk your mother to her seat.\" He turned around & winked at me. I started to cry & hardly stopped the whole weekend. They were happy tears. The only time my eyes were dry was when I was behind the camera. I got great pix & you can't see what you're shooting with blurry eyes. And to find a fellow ND fan. His music can make me feet better no matter how bad it is. I need to put some more on the Ipod my son gave me if I can figure out how. Was going to have him do it this past weekend, but the time goes so fast. KathyL, Hope you kicked some @ss today. I know what you mean about dreading the tx. But, wow, it's your last one. You rant all you want to, I have plenty of times. CHJ, I saw someone mention Paula Young wigs. I have had nothing but favorable comments on mine & that's where I got it. Including shipping it was about $50. And it's soooooo comfortable. Looked just like the picture too. We are all with you with the tears & the blues. I can get up fine, hear some song on the radio & burst into tears for the rest of the day. And I don't have half the things going on that you do. I've decided we are all entitled. What makes me the saddest is my youngest son, Clay. He is really having a hard time with this. He calls me every so often, crying, saying he just needed to hear my voice or say hi. He's always been the most sensitive of the 3 but it breaks my heart that he's so sad. He's 29 & single, not even a gf to share with. I'm gonna cry now if I keep talking about him. Cathy, Your Perisan market sounds wonderful. And of course you are seeing signs of spring, you are in CA. Us poor drowned rats in the mid-west don't have much to cheer about. My daffodils are up maybe 2\" but that's about all. But I agree, let's celebrate the new season. Maz, My heart aches for you & your bff. And not to be able to talk to her doubles your grief. I have a couple of friends like that & I have leaned on them so much since Dec. And to lose your aunt so recently too. I lost my Daddy 3 years ago. I was a Daddy's girl & I still grieve. But I still talk to him. I have pictures every where & sometimes talk right to them, other times I'll close my eyes or sit in a dark room. I admit it not as relieving every time, but the times I feel I really connected take such a load off of my mind. CarolC, Do you know what a service you did for all of us? We are opening ourselves up & discussing our depression, mood swings, weepys. I was beginning to think I was the only one. Everyone here was always so upbeat. Maybe a few rants about se's, but not much about our deep emotions. We are truly here for each other and I feel I can say things here that I might not tell anyone else. I finally ask my bff, 16-yr surv. if she ever got depressed. I was out of state while she was fighting bc & of course she never talks about her down days. She had them & that made me feel better. She is so strong I felt I was letting her down if I admitted to crying spells. We need to spill the beans, be truthful, at least here if not with those closest to us. Thank you Carol, for freeing me to unburden my soul.",

And there are a couple of things I need to do for dh for work. I'll wish everyone a Happy Easter now since I don't know what the next couple of days will bring. I know they won't be bringing Clay home. It's snowing like crazy in Milwaukee & he is smart not to start out. Dogs & cats are on duty again. Earlier I had 2 of each, but they have split up now & I have a dog at my feet & a cat on my scanner. I would be so lonely without them. Carol, McCordsville is just east of Indianapolis. Just across the county line. I'm 3 miles from work & the office is in Indy. And Indy is in the dead center of the state. LJ13, My game is called TouchMaster & it has 23 puzzle games, like Tetris, Bejeweled & some card games. I already had CSI but it requires a lot of concentration which I don't have al lot of these days so I wanted some quick puzzles. I want to get some of the \u2018brain power' games too but with chemobrain I probably couldn't pass the 1st level right now. KathyL, Sounds like we are just about in the same place with our se. I just made some grits & that really tasted good. Small & frequent seems to keep the nausea at bay. I would love your brownie recipe. I'll be off chocolate for a few days but then my taste comes back. Funny how my taste buds switch from sweet to salty as the weeks go by. Vettegal, I am so happy to hear your mom's good news. I agree about sharing the news on your sister. No one but dh & you guys know about this funny thing that showed up on the MUGA. And it's going to stay that way now that I know how hard Clay is taking this bc. In 3 wks when I get the results he should have been on his meds long enough to help him handle anything if it's not good news. And I rarely ask one son to keep a secret from the other. They do it to me all the time, but I really don't mind. I'm grateful they are close enough to share with each other & trust each other enough. I'm off to try a little work.  Love & hugs to all of you.",

Carol, did you take a detour thru IN on the way back from AZ? But I miss you guys & promised myself I wouldn't get so far behind. Carol, I am so jealous. Many years ago I had the chance to spend a few days in Palm Springs, CA. The mountains fascinated me. My gf & I would lay around the pool & ask \"Are the mountains still there?\" I would get up quite early, very un-like me, just to walk out onto the grounds to watch the sun rise behind the mts. Loved every minute of it & hope to see it again someday. Kimberly, I didn't do any hopping around with the eggs, but dh did. Dgs was so cute creeping around looking for eggs. His basket was a soft sided fire truck & he found it right away. I napped thru dinner, can't believe I can get so tired just talking to people. Probably was a good thing no one else was there. D1, Thanks for the heads up on the rad sim. I didn't know they did that & would have been surprised with all of the hubbub. I had planned on treating myself to a tatoo this Christmas. But I thought it would be a bit prettier than markings for rads. When this is all over I going. I'm glad you fingernail is OK. Glad too that you had it looked at. Julie, Your cartoons are so cute. I look forward to them. I am wondering how our oncs are going to keep tabs on us. I'll be anxious to hear what the other have to say. Right now I want to answer the question that came up on the MUGA, that will be tx #5 but will question him thoroughly on #6. Maz, It's natural that you think of your bff a lot. But I'm sure that every time you think of her you send up a little prayer & that's always good. Stay in touch with her, even if it's a quick \u2018hi'. Paula, Good for you & your hat. I am so sensitive to temps these days I can't imagine how I dealt with it when I couldn't take it off. Should I carry a razor with me when it grows back? I bet I do keep it shorter. I'm sorry you had to miss out visiting ds. I just keep reminding myself that hopefully next year will be back to normal & this year of exceptions will just be a distant memory. KathyL, Thanks so much for the recipe. Can't wait to try it. I haven't made scratch brownies in so long I'm really excited. I know dh will love the effort. I know I've missed some shout-outs. Believe me I thought them. But I've reached the end of my time for sitting up. How can my head be so heavy without any hair? I'll try again tomorrow.",

I have been questioned by a few people.  I look at it as a moment to get on my soap box about mammos.  There have to positive things that come from this & if I can get 1 gal to get a mammo then I will have done my job.  More is better, but 1 will suffice. I'm sure I've missed some shout outs, sorry.  But I couldn't stay away any longer. D1,  I am so bummed about your cyst.  I'm praying that it's just that, benign & just a pain in the side.  But I can't get over you calling him babydoc.  I wish I had a babydoc to look at.  My onc is my age but looks older (I think!) & my surgeon is a little younger, but nothing more than pleasant looking.  Had a dentist once that could hypnotize me with his blue eyes.  MAN!!!!!!  Almost didn't need nitrous.  Anyway I hope he finds you a kick-@ss surgeon. Well, I read a little further & got the good/bad news.  Good it can be drained, let's hope you can get into the partner.  Let's get this show on the road! Read some more....I'll be thinking of you tomorrow & wishing for tiny needles.  Just don't look, before, during or after.  I remember as a little girl my dentist (Not bue eyes) put a roll of cotton on the needle that held the novacain.  I never felt a thing until a neighbor told me there was really a needle in that cotton.  After that my blissful innocence was gone. I've ate all the cheese in the house or I'd share.  I did lose 6 lbs of water this week.  I keep telling myself I will eat healthy but when the cravings hit there is no hope. Patty, OK now I have your pictured walking into a casino, like the one in Las Vegas the TV show, & being greeted by.....now I can't think of her name.  The one who takes care of the special people.  I just started watching this year because of Tom Selleck & I don't have all the names down yet.  Especially since that stupid writers strike took every thing off mid season.  Would you people please stop talking about budding trees & smelling flowers.  I don't think Spring is ever going to come to IN.  They are talking about snow this weekend, lows in the 20's. Julie,  I'm sorry the truck is headed your way.  Don't you just hate knowing it's coming.  This was #4 for me & the worse by far because #3 wasn't out of my system.  I felt like the fatigue wasn't gone, my mouth was still sore, taste hadn't come back etc. Tina, Aren't we bad?  Eating even though our taste is off. Paula, I do have some memories with those boys.  Life is really boring since they have been gone.  Maybe if we were in the same city it wouldn't be so bad, but all I ever wanted was to be a \u2018mom' and now that it's not my full-time job anymore I'm lost.  And now I don't know where I got the energy to keep up with them.  I have less to do, more time to do it in and I still can't keep up. Carol, What great pictures!  Beautiful setting & it looks like you had a great time.  I really appreciate the effort you put in posting them.  And the magnet!  That's great.  Since there are no children in my house I can proudly stick mine right on the front of the fridge.  Love it!  Thank you my friend. Those schnauzers are adorable.  It's amazing how we miss our critters even when we are off having fun.  Now that you are getting good when are we going to see pix of the wieners? Diana, What a cutie, your nephew.  I remember how they like to experiment with those teeth.  It can hurt! Therese, Thanks for the good word on how you feel after chemo.  I love to hear about that light at the end of the tunnel.  Now my tunnel includes rads & I guess the fatigue continues with that.  But that light is there & I will find it. Paula,  If you have the choice save your well.  For one, you can use it to water plants & gardens.  Just unhook it from your water softener if you have one.  2nd, if there ever is a problem with the city water you will have your own private stock.  3rd, you may find the city water tastes like cr@p.  We went thru this a few years ago.  I was happy to get city sewer, who wants to constantly worry about a septic tank over flowing?  We found out too late that we could have kept our well but it was a long drawn out process.  Had to petition the county to test the water & prove it good.  Our little city had all the wells in town \"condemned\" so the state would pay for most of it.  It was going to take about 6 weeks & we received the notice less than 1 week from when they capped our well.  Our well water tasted great & we really wish we had been able to save the well & used from both.  I won't even go into the part of how they cracked the foundation & floor joists of our house trying to run in the water line. D326, Welcome.  This is a good bunch to follow.  I can't help with your decision as I'm on a totally different regime.  But you are right, the side effects (se) are different with everyone.  We may not be able to tell you which ones you will get, but we can offer lots of suggestions on what to do for each one. I'm off to write da(unt) a birthday letter & print some pix.  I'll check in tom.  I'm wishing everyone a good Friday & a great weekend.",

PALady, I hear you on self esteem.  My self-illusion is that everyone will think my bald head is what's making my face look so fat.  I didn't think these steroids would puff up my face like they do.  And now this AM my fingers are puffed up again.  Just like before I started taking the water pills.  What gives? Carol, Pulling names sounds good to me.  And we could switch every 3-4 months.  And someone different could pull each time because the one who pulls won't be in the dark as to who is her Secret Pal.  You do so much for this group you need to be in on the fun too. Julie,  Hang in there & don't worry about shout outs.  We will all be here when you arise from the fog.  Just take it easy & pamper yourself.  Good luck ignoring the noise in your house. Paula, The steak & bloomin' onion were sooooooo good.  Burned my mouth a little, but worth it.  And it was a nice evening, the sun actually was shining & I felt like a human again.  I had a frozen margarita & cheesecake for dessert.  I didn't get indigestion or fill with gas like usual.  It was a great night! CarolC, I am devastated for you.  How awful!  You go girl & stick with that lawyer & get something out of this.  I was shaking I was so mad as I read your post.  They have no right.  And to think you have been putting up with this harassment all this time & not saying anything to us.  You are one strong lady & I know you will come out ahead on this.  You will definitely be in my prayers. Therese,  I love the old swollen chipmunk description.  Thanks for the warning on how long it might be to shake all of the se.  And I'm getting Taxotere until next Jan. at least.  And I'm beginning to think all of my clothes are \u2018compression' I think I'll see if I can something else productive today.  Have to be inside this time, but yesterday encouraged me.  I sending strong thought to those battling the se and love & hugs to all.",

Carol,  I double checked all faucets, lights etc. b4 I left for work today.  Felt pretty good about myself till I got there & found out I sent an email to the wrong customer.    The recipient was pretty upset, not understanding why I was changing the quantity & pricing on her order.  I'm beginning to think that I can't be trusted with much. You are so lucky with your dog sitter.  We don't have one & I'm afraid my older boy would grieve too much if we left them at a kennel.  And one that comes with fresh flowers, WOW! I have been a Colts fan since I was in 1st grade & Johnny Unitas was quarterback.  I would watch with my dad & hope for a TD because they would ride this beautiful white horse around the stadium.  When they were the ones to come to Indy I was in 7th Heaven.  Yeah, I'm quite a fan.  You should see my office at work. I'll be anxious to hear all about your retreat.  Reggie is adorable!  I could just pick him up & cuddle. SisKimberly, Congrats for being invited to the thank you luncheon.  I'm sure your boss appreciates your being there as much as you can. I was planning on mopping the floor this weekend but I usually don't put that much water down. I'm glad to hear your thoughts on the boob pain.  Makes sense.  With the chemo & all the tests it's kinda hard to believe that surgery was only 3 months ago. It doesn't seem like we have been very active in the last 24 hrs.  Only 4 posts since my last night.  I hope it's not because some of are really suffering se.  Tomorrow will be a long day.  Herceptin at 9:00, then the chest x-ray at 11:00 and the CT w/contrast at 1:00.  And nothing to eat or drink after 9:00 because of the dye.  If there is a very long wait between xray & ct I may have to find somewhere to shop.  I know I'll be hungry& thirsty, I better be in a store that doesn't allow food.  I don't remember being told not to eat before a ct b4.  Maybe they were early in the AM & it didn't seem so bad.

News on my fil is not good.  We don't know about the mass on his kidney, but his liver is almost totally failed.  It is pumping some sort of poison into his system.  It's causing blood vessels to rupture.  They expect him to start losing cognitive abilities in a few weeks, with only a few months to live.  We saw him yesty at the hosp. b4 we knew all of this.  He looks good & says he is ready to go home, which I guess he's going to do tomorrow.  It makes me so sad.

Carol, That quilt is beautiful.  I'm sure you feel like you are literally wrapped up in love. Joan, Congratulations on finishing the chemo!  I'm so happy for you. KathyL, Put me down for chemo #5 of 6 on this Thurs., Black Thursday I call it. Congrats on the chocolate taste buds.  Mine leave me for a few days but so far have come back b4 the next tx. Next Jan. seems light years away.  Next Sun. 4/13 will be only 4 months since my diag.  How can so much have happened in 4 mos?  Seems more like 4 years. Your dinner sounded fab.  That's 2 mentions of salmon.  You're making my mouth water.  And to have the kids take care of everything.  Good rearing is what that is. Wow, Vettegal, One more person done w/chemo.  I'm getting jealous.  Of course I'm dreading Thurs. already.  Only 1 more after that but like I just said to KathyL, time is moving in strange increments these days.  Here's to getting back to normal b4 long. Is that a real Vette you are riding around in?  Now I get your name.  Didn't have a clue b4 now.  I had one once, a lifetime ago.  Once they get into your blood they are there for good aren't they.  I can't wait to see the picture.  I think it's sweet that your dh is worried about a cold. Tina,  We had sun yesty & today.  And my daffodils are starting to bloom.  I cut a bouquet this evening after work.  The hard part is finding a place to put them that one of the cats can't get to. Judy, I am so sorry about your news.  I didn't realize that you have been fighting this for so long.  You will be getting special prayers from me.  I am glad there won't be any delay is your getting health care.  Please keep us updated on your prognosis. I'm going to do a little research on liver failure.  I'll try to check back later.  Best wishes to all stepping up to the bar tomorrow.",

Enough about me.  I'm going to read a few past days posts (I said a few) & try to give some shout outs.  But one person I am concerned about is Paula.  I've been praying for you & your family Paula.  I hope things will get better.

KathyL, You just never know when a phrase will hit you & really make sense. When you said I should accept the pace at which I can work now a light bulb went off. I guess I am a different person now. I just feel that I should be the same. I'm so happy for you & your dd. Yes, this is just the beginning of milestones she will pass. And you WILL be there for each one of them.

You will be in my prayers. Carol, It was so good to talk to you last night. I value your 2-cents worth, you are always so full of good ideas.

He can be a bit stuck in a rut sometimes when it comes to trying something new. 10000000000000000000 (that wasDesiree the cat saying \"Hi\") But he did say we could have it again.

Gotta make you want to dance. Paula, I'm so glad to hear good news about your dh. And the kids too, will wonders every cease? I made a Mexican dish with gr.bf., frz. hash browns, salsa & cheese. It was really quick & easy. D1, our fearless leader, I know what you mean about perspectives on hair. Mine is about 1/4\" long, I can almost grab it. But there is way more gray than what fell out. I can't wait for it to be long enough for some color. I always wanted to try a really short haircut but didn't plan on doing it this way. But I am totally topless all the time now. I'm proud of what's growing & want to show it off. Tina, It's good to hear from you. But now I read your next post and I am so sorry about your Kitty. These pets have a way of worming their way into our lives & hearts and it hurts so bad to let them go. But I agree, you did the right thing. There is a poem out there somewhere about a dog (cat) talking to his person & asking him not to hang on too long. That when the time is right to please help him go painlessly. I've had to do that many times in the past as I always have more than one running around. It is never easy & it hurts for a long time. Do you know the story about the Rainbow's Bridge? I have to believe that is true. Dana, I'm sorry about your friend too. But he does have you to help him enjoy what time he has. Even if he isn't officially your dog, it's going to hurt there too.  Read some of what I sent to Tina.  I think both poems can help before it's time too. I hope I haven't left anyone out, but the pizza was just delivered & I'm hungry. Not the best thing for an old, overweight, water retaining, almost bald woman, but what the heck. It will be my one splurge this week. Take care everyone. I'm sending positive vibes to you all.",

Tues. & Thurs. nights, had a funeral calling for a co-workers dad & had the 3-yo dgs Fri. night. My #2ds came in from Milw. for F-Day's weekend & he & I took my mom out to lunch on Sat.  Sun. was over to ds#4's place for dinner prepared by him & his cousin. I left dh there & went back to the hospital & came back in time for dinner & a squirt gun fight with all of the boys, big & small. I'm sorry to say there is no change in Tyler except they have had to sedate him more because of his breathing. He's fighting the respirator or something & Dr. said he could \"blow a lung\", whatever that means. Bff doesn't ask all of the questions I would, but I also know she is exhausted. Rad #12 of 33 was today. I'm starting to ache deep in the tissue under my nipple and underarm. All normal they say. I'm noticing big hugs like those given by sons & nephews bring on tender moments too. Rad doc says my skin looks good & to keep up the green tea & cream. I'm trying to go into work in the am, leave for rads at 10:00 & stop by home for skin tx when I'm done. Also maybe a short tip back in the recliner for a recharge & then back to work for the rest of the day. Makes for long days & I'm really tired at the end, but I figure I have to do this to regain my stamina. I'm really getting sick of this stuff. I want my job back, my normal duties, but dh says I shouldn't try until rads are over & \"I'm myself again\" I'm starting to hate that phrase. And truthfully I don't have time to do it now, I'm too busy fixing all of the screw ups that those other 2 bimbos are making. That is all I'm doing these days. I had a small melt down at work today I was just so tired of cleaning up after them. Enough of that, thank you for letting me vent. I am going to have to get by with just a few shout outs to the most recent posts. I have to get off here & get a few things done. I've read it all & done silent prayers, whoohoos etc to each of you as I read you posts. D1, Your meal sounds scrumptious! I'm still stuck in that middle that if I work 1/2 - 3/4 of a day I don't have the energy to get fancy in the kitchen. But I will. It's hard to get excited about food when I know I should be dieting. Kimberly, Count me in the drought. I'm in the same no-libido boat as Carol. And being tired all of the time doesn't help. Carla, Bummer on the bump. It really makes you wonder if we can develop another non-cyst (can't bear to say the \"T\" word right now) while we're on chemo what's next. You will be in my prayers that your surgeon's gut feeling is wrong. I know the 27th is a ways off & if you're like me you're not very patient but try to find something to distract yourself. Here's another resolution to stay caught up.",
