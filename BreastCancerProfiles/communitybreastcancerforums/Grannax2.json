For her part she was sitting at a desk, in her Christmas pajamas (her costume). Writing a letter to santa. Then she would sing what she had written ( typical musical). Her voice was clear and she didn't miss a note. Not to mention that she is adorable, everyone loved her. The Musical tweet Dear Santa was a movie in 2011. The whole family has their priorities mixed up, except for Molly who writes a sweet letter to Santa. He comes to tell the family how much he loves Molly's letter. It might be a fun movie to watch.",

Three nights of coughing, the nights seem to be the worst. I still have fever, too and no energy during the day. But, tonight I can't sleep. I hope the Tamiflu will kick in soon, tomorrow will be my third day. I feel like im in jail. I cant go anywhere until I've had no fever for two days. If it's not one thing its another. Evidently, there is widespread flu in every state. I guess this year's flu shot wasn't very effective.  ",

We tent camped with the group, brought our horses and went on long rides everyday. My favorite vacation. Have fun on yours. I think my flu is over, well not completely.

At least I was able to find the title and the COD, the adjuster was good to sent me the rest of what I needed. So, it was Fed EXed yesterday. I found out from my PCP that I'm anemic again. I've had a lot of trouble with that in the past. Summer of 2016, a few months before my DX of MBC my iron was seriously low. I had to have IV iron. Now, I look back and think it was the cancer that caused the anemia. I've been surprised that my iron has stayed normal all through my TX, until now. Also, it's time for a colonoscopy. UGH. The indignities we have to endure. So off to the GI doc I go. Too many docs. Grrr My DD is going back for her first day of work today. She really likes her part time job and is glad she's finally able to go back. Her eye surgeries really help with her headaches. My son bought a house yesterday! It's a milestone for him and my DDIL. They worked 12 long years together so he could become a doctor. So, now they they have their big \" doctor\" house. It is so beautiful, not ostentatious, but high quality and big. Just what they have been dreaming of all those years they worked so hard. I'm so happy for them.😀",

Or should I just Google? It sound very helpful. One of my SE of ibrance is sinus infections. I've had about 5 since I started treatment that required antibiotics to clear up. Now, I take Mucinex every day and it has helped. But, yesterday I started getting one. Ugh. Of course it was too late to call my MO. So, no I have not been cruising around in my Caddy. Boo I did drive it a lot on Tuesday. It's so nice. I even worried about where to park it. Haha. Don't want any scratches on my new, old Caddy! I just finished my 12th round of I/F. I had a couple of times that I had to take an extra two weeks off. One of which was in January when I was getting over the flu. For some reason going back on, after a break, the SE are harder on me. Along with sinus infection, I've had extreme fatigue, more painful joint pain, etc. I know from experience when I've been on it a few months that will decrease or I get used to it. It's kinda like t was at the beginning each time I take a break and start up again. Weird. And I have more hair loss too. The other SE I suffer with is moodiness/ depression. I know that's from letrozole. I keep a handle on that with Cymbalta. I've taken it for several years, way before my DX and it works like a dream for me. But, when I started on letrozole one year ago, it was quickly evident how much worse I felt. So, my PCP upped my dose. That did the trick, except for when I start back up after a break. All that to say, I've been an emotional basket case this past week. Inexplicably, I think buying the car was emotional for me. It's the first car I've had to buy since my husband died. My budget was so small I had to go to very shady used car dealer to find a car. That was traumatic for me. They are known for cheating people, most of their clientele are people that have very bad credit. Our salesman told us that they double the price of the car and then finance at huge interest rates and then repo. In other words, that's how they make their money, not on cash client like me. He directed us to the only 2 cars out of 200 that were worth buying! I do not like being in places where no one is trustworthy. Thankfully our salesman seemed to be the exception to the rule. At least, I hope so. Otherwise my Caddy may fall apart net week! I sure didn't intend to write such a long post. Sometimes words just fall out of my brain onto this thread. 😑",

I think it has little fibers in it but I've tried other brands and it's never helped. So, I was so impressed I got the eyebrow pencil. I haven't tried it yet but it's highly pigmented and it fills in thin eyebrows without looking fake. And it lasts 24 hours. I got a couple of other products too. For your first order if you use code Welcome 15 you get 15%off. Also free shipping on 35 or more. I was thinking of you micmel and the wedding. Wouldn't it be great if you could eyelashes and eyebrows that didn't come off while you're crying at DD wedding? I got eyeliner that is not supposed to smear either.

So, your DH will have his surgery soon? I've never had shoulder surgery but know several people who have. It's turned out well for them, but takes time and PT. Neck surgery I have had. It was to remove C3 because MBC was there. So, I'm sure that's not the same as what your DH is going to need. But I can answer questions about neck surgery and recovery. Micmel I love sparkly shoes, yours are so pretty, I can easily pretend they are red! Friday is so close. I'm always better when I can finally say Its tomorrow. Somehow it calms me when I get to that day. That day, Thursday, I will be having a colonoscopy. Not what anyone looks forward to, the dreaded prep is the worst part. 😵 Mae that food looks yummy. I'm only going to be drinking liquids and rx on Wednesday. Yuck. I have to go get all that today, so I better go.",

It's been rough SE for the past few months. I'll be off a total of three weeks. The week I get back is scan week, I bet I will have less scanxiety because I won't be as emotional. I find that both I and F cause a lot of emotional upset, or make it worse. We have to give ourselves a break and realize we are trying to cope with a deficit. These meds not only kill cancer but sometimes they disturb our ability to reason through problems. That's my opinion, anyway.

I think it's because I was off for a month and my counts got up to normal range. For me that means a high WBC, etc. I've already had labs and they aren't nearly as low as they usually are at this point in cycle. I'm glad for that because I need energy to keep up with my workers. I've been to Lowes every day this week for more supplies. Going again tomorrow. And more money so he can buy more stuff that only fits in his truck. UGH It's looking really good. The paint color is pretty in bath, the wood ceiling in my bedroom is partially up so I can see how amazing it's going to look. Tomorrow wood floor in bath and maybe all doors, trim and baseboards painted.",

Yes, he has to wait over a year to take that blasted test again, it's still so aggravating that they don't give it more often. But, his work goes on and he loves it.

One doc says he thinks it's MS, but it might be Lupus or sarcoidosis. She has to wait until next Tuesday to have an MRI, talk to neurosurgeon about her shunt and appt with PCP who thinks all of this is being blown out of proportion. Then go to her Neuro-ophthalmologist on Wednesday for the results of MRI. Even after that there may still need to be more tests before a clear DX. She's 44, how old were you at DX of lupus? She also has a rare disorder called pseudo tumor cerebri. That's why she has a shunt. If anyone else knows anything about MS or sarcoidosis I could use a little help here.",

It's about a dermatologist who mostly removes growths etc. She does all of it with local anesthesia. She does a lot of lipomas, a collection of fat cells under the skin.

I'm doing good, still riding on a high from January PET that showed no uptake in liver mets, again. Of course, I still have SE of IF. Yesterday was not a good day. The mouth sores are worse this time, fatigue Ugh, joint pain Ugh, pity party was especially hard yesterday. But, today I woke up feeling better! Then I got a text from DIL asking if I can come over to help out with my grandchildren. That's my happy place.

I'm hoping those yitrium spheres are just just busy fighting and winning against the tumors and that's causing the swelling. I have had the left lobe done and will do the right on May 24. I have a 25 year history of B.C. and in 2000 MBC to C-3. After surgeries, I had Taxotere. It was not real easy for me but I made it through and the bone Mets never came back.

But I can see that for those of us who are resistant to hormonals, maybe its possible. Maybe that scenaro has not been studied. As for next treatment, after progression, she still said she is think about AA. I said I dont want to take aromisin, I've take it before and obvious none of those drugs work for me anyway. She talked about fda and how AI has to be ordered with drugs like ibrance and afinitor. But between the lines I'm wondering if the AI could be ordered but not taken? So, my PET is ordered for late May, after my trip to Hawaii. She said if I have only a little progression I could stay on ibrance. That's what I hoping for and I think I finally understand. I may be flushing my AI down the toilet from now on. Meanwhile am having a test. On Monday to make sure i dont have PE.

Lung Mets could lead to infection and fever. My opinion and my MO opinion, liver mets are the most serious and deserve special attention whether they hurt or not. Ask your MO about radioembolization, a local TX done by a Interventional Radiologist (IR). Also called y90. I think 1.6 cm is big enough but you would have to have a consultation with an IR. If your MO says no, do your own research and schedule your own appointment. Several of us have had successful y90's for liver mets. We have a thread for local treatments where you can read about the procedure. There are other local treatments, too. Microwave Ablation is another one. You're in Kansas? There should be an I R there who specializes in y90. You may not be a candidate but it worries me that your MO does not seem concerned about your liver mets. It looks like you've been on IV chemotherapy. Maybe that's why she's not addressing your liver mets. Have you ever been on Ibrance? It really has worked on my lung mets, I don't have bone Mets but I've heard it's good for those, too. My liver mets did not respond to Ibrance. That's why I had local TX and systematic TX. S Let us know how you're doing.",

I talked to the founder yesterday, she wants me to be a participant in their Fashion Show next Friday. So, I may sound bold, confident and fearless on this thread but when it it come to walking a Cat Walk runway I'm a chicken. Not on my bucket list! But, I do admire their platform. The founder, Suzanne, had colorectal cancer with mets to liver. Thirteen years ago she had a y90! She's alive and well. Basically, they are promoting and educating doctors and patients about the role of y90 in advanced cancer patients. She told me that I will be pampered all day. Hair, make up and a designer gown. So I go in on Friday morning for the fitting/ alterations, etc. Also, interviews and photography. OMG. And she said I get to keep the gown! I like the thought of dressing up like royalty but walking the runway feels like walking the gauntlet to me. I don't like being in the spotlight, I turn into a shaking mess, my throat closes, I look like a deer in the headlights. What am I to do? I also have to write one paragraph about my story ONE paragraph, are you kidding me? I couldn't fit my story into ten paragraphs! Then I have to give them five words to describe myself. Help. Oh, and the Media will be there. Evidently, they have this type of fashion show all over the U.S., even New York City! I'm just kinda shy really, not a celebrity wanna be. Plus, I'm 70, have one reconstructed boob and no right boob( skin died so reconstruction failed), overweight, short legs ( not a long legged strutting model type) and too many scars to count. She said most of the gowns are strapless! Ummm, how is that going to work? To say I'm nervous is an understatement. Part of me wants to say Thank you but No. I do think if my DS would walk me down the runway, I would be OK. I just found out about this yesterday! There's a very good chance he has plans or has to work. Maybe my SIL would do it. As you can see I'm a confused mess. 😱",

I was into the look good feel better philosophy. And it worked. The next 2 times in 2000 and 2009, I was not working. I wore a wig less but still I never even went to the grocery store without it. The first place i went without my wig in 2010 was to my husband's funeral. Perspective. If I have to lose my hair at some point with MBC, I think I will wear a wig less but doubt I will go wigless when going out. Unlike some people, I don't think I look pretty without hair. My head is not pretty. My mom said they had to use forceps to get me out and I have dents in my head to prove it! Seriously. I'm not a baseball cap lady, and scarfs are hot! But, behind all that, is i would rather not draw attention to myself and my plight. Attention means answering lots of questions and getting those \" Oh, I feel so sorry for you.\" Looks. I know, some people think it's showing bravery to go out bald, to each his own. All that said, I think it might feel different this time, \"Freeing\" somebody said. That makes sense to me.

Therefore, as hard as it is for you now, I don't think you needed to be there for all that. Family drama always takes center stage during a family member's death. All that to say, I survived all that and went thirteen more years before I was DX with MBC again. I'm am not trying to equate my story to yours, just saying you might have been spared a grueling death scene by your sister's actions, or lack thereof. Obviously, your need now is to do first things first. Talk to your MO about your treatment plan. There are so many ladies here who have had extensive liver progression.

That was when my husband was being treated for pancreatic cancer, we had chemo dates. But, i was able to take care of him, during his last year, even though I was having chemo and radiation TX.

In my case my MO brought it up to me after my 3 month PET showed growing tumor in my liver. I'm still surprised that I was a candidate because I have multiple mets in lung, chest and liver.

I'm determined not to pay any attention to what my July PET says about size of liver mets. Because the IR told me sometimes they look bigger at 3 months, the 6 month scan shows the true result. Of course, I am optimistic about how my lung and chest mets will look in July. My MO asked if I just wanted to wait to do scan until October. I said NO. Because I really want/need to know that Ibrance/femara is working. My March scan gave mixed results.

Since then I have learned that pain from liver can manifest itself in odd places. I guess they call it referred pain. After my y 90 procedure I had really sharp pain in my right shoulder joint and pain when trying to take a deep breath. I think the liver must get inflamed anytime you have procedures and it takes awhile to calm down. It's only been a month since you had your liver BX? I only have my personal experience to go on but I think it is remarkable that I've had so little pain from so many liver mets. Before I was DX I just assumed it would be extremely painful if someone had many mets to liver, lung and chest. But, now I know that's common not to have pain. No sugar coating. But, I doubt your pain is from progression. It's too soon to know. The first few months are nerve wracking. Because you don't know. And I imagine you're feeling like your body has betrayed you. I've been on Ibrance/femara since January 5. My scan in March showed mixed results. Now I'm waiting till August for my next scan to see how my mets have responded to 7 months of treatment and 2 y90 procedures. The waiting, we call it scanxiety, is the worst. You'll see that every one of us has it. Even the scan won't be completely definitive. Sometimes it takes awhile to show true results. It will help you to read the posts here. These ladies are remarkable, knowledgeable and resilient. It helps me to write here, to read, to learn and to have hope.  ",

He then said \" oh, we don't need it for yours, they are big\" What!?!? This was back at the beginning, before y 90, it kinda freaked me out of course. Evidently, there are different types of PET machines. Older versions, updated version, top of the line versions. I was told that there is only one other place that has this top of the line, most updated version in Texas. One is at MDA the other is here at Presbyterian Dallas. So, after all this conversation, I'm going to ask for that attachment for my December PET. As you know, the August PET showed no uptake, as a result of y90, but I'm getting scared that there were little ones hiding that were not seen. I have a friend who had y90 with good results, then on next scan there were 20. Yikes. Now, she's at 50 to 80% tumor burden. Sad for her. She doesn't have MBC, she has Metastatic Ocular Melanoma. When I've had CT without contrast, the radiologist kept saying \"Cannot be seen clearly because of no contrast\" so, that's out for me. But, I will ask about MRI if there seems to be anything unclear on PET report.",

Having a recent BX is good, too in case it has mutated. Genomic Alterations testing has confusing results sometimes. You don't change treatments based only on those results. In your case, absolutely I think you should push to have one and a liver BX. It just might give info that could make a huge difference in your treatment plan.

As long as you consistently get the same type, so that they can compare apples to apples, so to speak, you're good. I think PET is fascinating. They actually inject you w radioactive tracer and glucose. Then an hour later the scan to see where the tracer lights up. In nontechnical terms, I tell people it shows how much the cancer is \"eating\". They call that uptake. Less uptake is good, more is bad. For example when I was DX 19 months ago, the uptake was bad. It showed 7 or higher in multiple tumors in my liver, chest and lung. My last PET showed 2 and 3's uptake in chest and lung. Each scan they are \"eating\" less and less. My liver mets are not \"eating at all\" called inactive since I had y90 one year ago. Of course it's disconcerting that cancer eats sugar, which is technically not exactly correct. Ha",

Y90 worked for over a year, I was getting confident that it would last another year. She is referring me to him to see if this one can be helped by y90. But it's very near the other ones, if it's one of the ones he's already done, it can't be done again. There might be other local procedures he can do. She wants me to take Afinitor/aromison. I'm not real confident in those two drugs but I'll give it a try. I know you have bigger problems to deal with.

She said it's up to me whether to take AA or Ibrance. But she thinks I will regret it if I go back on Ibrance and on the next scan my liver has multiple mets. The I R told me the MRI was negative and the 2 cm, 5.1 uptake on PET didn't show up on MRI. He also said there are 2 hot spots on PET. I have my MRI report now. It shows four tiny spots in my left lobe suspicious for metastasis. They are between 6 and 8mm each. He said they might be just scar tissue. What do I do? Now I know that I have six lesions in my liver that may or may not be mets. I think my MO thinks they are and doesn't want to take chances. I think the IR is mainly saying that there's nothing he can zap because the two scans to do not correlate. The good news is that I don't have to decide until the 28th. I hope I can put it aside and not dwell on it too much on my vacation. But, my brain is not good at compartmentalizing. Especially in regard to cancer! I am going to have fun in spite of my CANCER.

After he gets some rest, I will tell him about next Friday and see if he's available. He is on call so he may have been in the OR all day and night. He's an anesthesiologist.

I hope all of us could have treatment that matches mutations. It just makes sense to me. Seems like everything is trying to keep us from feeling all the joy of Christmas.

Microwave Ablation is out completely because of the location. What I'm wondering now is, can a BX be done? I hope so. I want to see if my cancer has mutated to having different receptors, therefore I would need different drugs to treat it. I also want to have the Foundation One test done on this one. I have the report now. There are about six suspicious places none bigger than 1cm. I've also realized that the PET is more definitive for me rather than the MRI. Not the norm but that is my MO. I always fall into the rare possibilities category. Now I'm really wondering what my PET will look like. I'm also wondering if things should be speeded up a little rather than waiting till after Christmas. You know it takes time to get BX receptor studies back. So if I could get my PET sooner and then a BX. I could get results back and start on the right meds instead of a shot in the dark like AA. Of course that might mess up my Christmas plans. But these liver mets have been untreated for four months already, we know from the very beginning they don't respond to Ibrance. So, what to do?",

It has affected them but they don't know why. They want me to stay with her because of the convenience. I was put up with her crap because I didn't want to inconvenience my kids because they are so busy. So I'm writing to my PCP to help me find an MO at ITS A. She has already offered to do that. She knows I need one who is a good match. One that believes it's OK for patients to be knowledgeable and literate. The one I have hates her patients to read. Can you believe that?!?!",

I hope you will ask your MO about it and other local treatments available to you. I don't know anything about your new meds. One of the chemo drugs sound similar to doxirubicin. I had it a 26 years ago. So maybe yours is in that family of drugs. Where do you live? I assume you are going to a major cancer center? You may not be a candidate for y90, which is radio embolization of the liver. Even if your MO says no, research an interventional radiologist who specializes in y90. Get his opinion. They often have a different viewpoint than MO. ",

I should try again now that I'm an old pro at this.....not. ha I have a very complicated 26 year history with four DX of BC and MBC. The ladies and men have read so many of my posts here that they sort of know my story. I post mostly on this thread, Ibrance thread and my husband, my cancer......thread. Back in 92 at age 44 was my first DX. In 2000 it came back in breast and C3. So, technically I've been MBC since then. But, it was only in one place so MDAnderson put me in a trial for surgery to remove it and taxotere x six. It was a cure for bone Mets, never came back. Then 2009, only in breast Abraxane x I don't remember how many. The November 2016 DX MBC to liver, lung and chest. ERPR+HER-. Yes, I had a liver BX. Listen to the other ladies on this, I wasn't breathing very well so they had to intubate me. Went to MDA again and they put me on IL. I've been on it ever since and still responding. Except for liver. I've already told you that part. I had the y90's in April and May of 2017. More about that on local treatments thread. So there you have the short story, lots and lots of details left out. I'm 70 now and doing well. Of course I have the typical SE of IL but tolerable most of the time. Hope this helps. It's hard being a newbie, it's even hard to be an oldie. But we soldier on.",

She said it saved her so much time. She was impressed with me, I with her. So, my PET is on April 8, appt with her April 11. I was a little disappointed in how long I have to wait for my PET. But, at least I will be able to see it on my portal. She said she thinks X will be a good TX for me. Awesome that would be wonderful. But, she's very glad I've had a wash out time and she is going to check on clinical trials for me. I really like this idea. She's also doing another Genomic Test on my December 27 liver BX. They use Tempest. Never heard of it. She's also going to do a tumor marker CA15-3. I just saw the result on portal, normal. Tumor markers have never correlated with my disease. She's ordered generic testing, our family has done it but it was twenty years ago. Negative for Braca 1 and 2. We obviously have a mutated gene running in my mother's side of our family but to my knowledge they have not isolate it yet. My grandmother, my mother, me and my sister. My daughter goes to the same cancer center. They monitor her with mammograms and breast MRI each year. She's 47, no problems. I was 44 at first DX. I am so relieved to be back in good hands. PTL. 💞",

It's based on a true story about a girl whose mother died in a car accident, she has to go live with her father in Canada. She finds some baby geese and raises them. When it's time to migrate she teaches them how to fly and leads them to their winter home by flying this homemade contraption her father made for her. I guess that's a random thought, sort of. But when we grieve for others, sometimes important feelings come up. I did share this with my BFF. I hope it will be used a very long time from now.",

Depending on what the PET shows, the one they are most concerned about is in my left lobe. I hope that's not hard to get to. It was 2cm last August on PET. Who knows what it will show this time.

My MO said \" bizarre\", I said I do bizarre really well. My Nick name is zebra from many docs. So, the plan: stop IL, schedule Liver BX for this week, Start AA on the 31st.

My biggest request was that I wanted a BX this week. I had to push a little for that. Thankfully, I found out earlier that day that my IR does have openings this week. I don't know which day yet.

Even at the beginning when I had so many active mets, or now with progression. My MO explained that unless the cancer is blocking the bile duct numbers stay normal. Although it sounds like that is not always true either. Who knows. My MO does not do tumor markers either. Scwilly I've heard some MO RX diuretics to help with ascites . It kinda makes sense, you might ask your MO. AA is interesting. My first eight days my appetite went away and absolutely nothing tasted good. Yesterday, my food tasted really good, I was surprised. Then I started having nausea. What?! I don't have mouth sore and have decided to be non compliant about the mouthwash, I'm not using it until I get a sore. I have a track record of turning into a crazy person if I even look at dexamethasone. So, I put it in my cabinet until needed. I do have fatigue, sometimes worse than Ibrance. But it comes on suddenly not gradually, random. Weird. No coughing or any signs of pneumonitis. PTL. So far so good, I think. For some the no appetite gets so bad patients lose 20-30 pounds. Of course if they get mouth and throat sores it's even worse. I go to my MO on Monday, I'll get my BX pathology report. I wonder if it has changed, I'm hoping it comes back HER2+. We already know I have ESR1, therefore resistant to AI. But here I am having to take AI with Afinitor. Grrr. My new genomic test results won't be back for two months. I'm going to read up on your trial Katy, I didn't realize you're at MD A. That's only four hours from me. Maybe a future treatment for some of us but I don't have the PK whatever it is mutation.💞",

Depending on where it it located in the liver, I'd vote for liver cancer primary. If it's a met with no known origin that's hard. BC Mets treatable. It's a toss up right now.

In tears today, feeling anxious about the thought of changing MO and/ or staying with MO. Each is just as upsetting. I know the AA is still in my system so my ability to be rational is warped. Worst of all my daughter and SIL were with me at the appointment and do not think I should change. They did not the eye rolls or pick up on any facial expressions that I saw. Or her sarcasm and insulting words were lost on them. I'm an empath, a people pleaser. My daughter, especially is the opposite. So...I'm in tears. I have full faith in X thanks to two years here. Otherwise I would not know. Yes, I think Abraxane is probably next. I did it 9 years ago, no problem except hair loss. I did it with benadryl not steroids. She says no it will have to be steroids. The arguments never end. Is Doxil ever used for third line? But, it probably does have to have steroids. I react so bad to steroids, my whole body turns red, seriously. Oh well, hopefully I will get a good two years on X. I think my next scan will be in April. I am absolutely positive AA did no good. Basically I have not been on an appropriate TX in five months.

Not comfortable changing MO, sort of scared she'll put me on something different. I really want to give X a try first. HLB. Thank you for your empathy. Yes I think I will talk to my daughter about not going next time. She sometimes in nerves me when she's there. It's not a big deal appointment next time anyway. No results to discuss, just evaluation of first two weeks on X. Candy that's exactly my plan. Get all AA out of my system, it affected me so badly in so many ways. I know I'm not coo coo because so many of you had AA nightmare too. My opinions are validated by all of you. I'm deciding not to decide until I get back from NYC.

I'll have a scan to see if it's working in late June, I think. I'll start my third cycle on Tuesday. I'm encouraged because I can tell my lung mets are better. I was able to walk up three flights of stairs without stopping because of SOB. I couldn't do that three months ago. The liver mets are a mystery, of course. But I hope they are responding. I was completely worn out and busy after the retreat. It was in SE Oklahoma, one of my favorite places on earth. All free to me, PTL. We stayed in beautiful cabins nestled in Beavers Bend State Park. One was owned by one of my MBC friends. It's a mansion cabin. Three stories of gorgeous. John was there, too. He took a zillion pics and interviewed all of us again. I was not expecting to be interviewed, I hope he will edit out the \"deer in the headlights\" shots. No modeling, no gowns just camping type clothes. The real me. I don't know when my video will be ready and on U tube. Meanwhile, I finally got my new kitchen floor installed. It's beautiful but a lot of work including all my appliances in my living room and dining room and den. UGH. It's all back in place finally. Love it I'm so sad to hear about so many of you having so many problems with your liver monsters. I don't have any advice, just know I'm wishing the best for you.

But, if that was the case I think you would have other SE, like skin looking yellowish and the whites of your eyes. I'm assuming you don't have those. Also , it would cause your liver numbers on labs to worsen. I think your MO would have mentioned that.. In some cases people on Ibrance have reported a skin rash but you haven't been on Ibrance very long. So, I think you have a mystery rash and it has nothing to do with your cancer. Keep in mind I'm not a doctor just a long time patient who has also cared for other Cancer patients. Personal experience and lots of reading on this forum are my only qualifications.

Tomorrow will be exciting for my granddaughter. She starts middle school. She went to an orientation last week and is a little overwhelmed. She's a sixth grader, the school is enormous compared to elementary. It has three stories and all her classes are on different levels. She's worried about getting/ finding all her classes on time. I remember feeling all of that when I started Jr. High. I had dreams about ending up in the wrong class. But, this is my super confident, super smart theatre star! I was none of those things at her age. So, I thought she wouldn't be feeling all of that like I did. Wrong. She's also my smell the roses, never gets in a hurry, incredible imagination girl. That's the problem. Her teacher s have always made sure she is in the right class at the right time. She's never had to be responsible for that. My son thinks it will be a good thing for her. He gets frustrated with having to call her five times when it's time to go somewhere. She hates hurrying. We'll see how the first day goes. My grandson, on the other hand, loves to be on time or early. He's always put his clothes out the night before, all matching perfectly. He told us he's the best dresser in his kindergarten class. He has been known to wake up before anyone and be ready before anyone else is even awake. I expect that's what will happen tomorrow for the first day of first grade. Once again, it's fascinating to me that two kids from the same parents can be so different. Mine were like that, too. I will have scans in two weeks. I'm really expecting them to be even better than they were 3 months ago. That would put me very close to NEAD. Then the doubt creeps in. I have two vacations planned for September. If there is progression it could mess up those fun plans. UGH. Why do we have to live like this? The first one is a road trip to Lake Tenkiller in NE Oklahoma. As a teenager I went there with my parents and a group of ten families from our church every weekend and summer. The \"oldest \" kids who are now 70 ish are still my close friends. So all seven of us are going to meet there for a reunion. OMG. I'm so excited to be with them for a few days. We are scattered throughout Texas and Oklahoma now and don't get to see each other much. See, this is why you should not miss my posts, they are way too LONG. The next trip is to fly to Baltimore with my DD and DSIL. I'll be gone a week. We're staying on Kent Island at a friend's beautiful home on the eastern shore of the bay. So that pretty much sums up the next month of my life. Agony and ecstasy. What an exciting life we live. Drama, I'm praying for no drama during the next four weeks.Glad I have friends here who \"get it\".💞",

I'm excited because I get to spend a whole day with my grandchildren tomorrow. They are my happy place.👧👦 On Sunday, my daughter and I are going on a short road trip. We're going travel down memory/family history lane. We're going to visit the little town where my grandparents raised my mother, and where I spent every summer. We are going to stay in a little cabin, built in the 40's., with a river view. It's in Beavers Bend State Park in SE Oklahoma. The fall colors are spectacular in this hidden area of Oklahoma. These are the things that enable me to cope with MBC. Although, in truth, we are making a memory. If we don't make it happen now, it might not happen. As I turn 70 this year, I've told my kids I don't want a big party. I want to take little trips like this, to spend memorable time with my family and friends. If it takes all of my 70th year to make these trips happen, that's OK with me.",

My DD just had some tests done and her Dr. says he thinks she has MS. Oh my goodness, I hope it's not true. She has to have more tests, of course. The next one is an MRI. Sometimes it shows the MS lesions but not always. All this is complicated by the fact that she has a rare disorder called pseudo tumor cerebri. It's a not well understood disorder where the ventricles in the brain do not distribute the cerebral spinal fluid properly. Therefore, the fluid builds up and causes severe headaches and damage to the optic nerve. She's been dealing with this for over 20 years. She has a shunt that is supposed to regulate the build up of CSF. About a month ago, she started having some new problems with her vision. after many visits with her neuropthalmologist, he ordered a lumbar puncture. She's had many of these, but this time the labs on the spinal fluid showed too much protein. He had his nurse call her to say that he thinks she has MS. She was devastated. He would not elaborate at yesterday's appointment, just ordered the MRI. Obviously, communication is not his strong suit. They have done some research and know that there's obviously something wrong. But, the other possibilities are Lupus and Sarcoidosis. There's one lab that is not elevated, that should be if it's MS. So, lots of confusion. If anyone on this thread that knows something more about MS, please let me know. I don't know for sure which labs are elevated, but I think IGG and MS ? She's only 45 and has already been dealing with so much. Thankfully, she lives only ten minutes away and her husband is amazing. They have no children. This situation is all consuming for me today.

The most troubling part is that without a shunt, her fluid will build up even worse causing unrelieved massive headaches and possibly blindness.. PTC is such a rare disorder that there is no known cure or even treatment. She's had about ten shunts in the past twenty years. All but this one have become infected. So, it's complcated. She's on disability because of it. I'm praying that this one can be fixed, somehow. I am clueless as to how the surgeon would do this. But, I do know that she needs a different neurosurgeon. The one she has is very rude and condescending to my DD and DSIL. They sure need our prayers for finding a more compatible doc. Her PCP is working on finding a different one to refer her to.",

My DDIL had to stay in the hospital for two months prior to Blake being born. No more grandchildren for me. My DD eye doc told her yesterday it was like working under water when he did her ONSF procedure, because there was so much spinal fluid behind her optic nerve. She feels so much better now that it is drained. The slit will let it continue to drain. Her left eye will be done Jan 4. These procedures will keep her from losing her eyesight as well as decrease her headaches. WiN win! I have PET on January 9. Now that Christmas is over, I already feel some scanxiety creeping in. It's been 5 months since my last one. As we all know, anything can happen in five months. I wish not having pain anywhere was an indicator of no MBC progression. I didn't even have pain a year ago at DX, except for a cough, and it was in lung, chest and liver. But, I do have some confidence that I've only been on Ibrance one year. I should get another year out of it. Also, I had y90's that looked successful in my last scan. I hate MBC. It's so unpredictable. .",

Just when i start to feel sorry for all of us with MBC, I think of my DD, who has had almost as many surgeries as I have, but they've been on her brain. You should see her pics right after her shunt was placed!!!! Shaved head with a big candy cane shaped scar on her head, scar behind her ear and big scar on her abdomen. Multiply that procedure times ten, in the past ten years. Add ten more years of pain and treatment, because she was DX at 25. We have it bad, I know, but we're NOT alone in the suffering catagory. Unlike her mother, she is totally comfortable with a bald head.LOL. she thinks hair is just a lot of unnecessary trouble. This cracks me up, especially since I was a hairdresser forever. I'm the one who shaves her head prior to surgery. I pout about the fact that ive lost mine three times. She's had hers shaved ten times! We're not alike in lots of ways but I admire her attitude. And, of course as any mother, I wish there could be a cure, or even long term relief of pain. Maybe this time the relief of her headaches will last a long time. Meanwhile, it is January. It's not a good month for me, it's depressing. Putting Christmas decor up is depressing, Everything looks and feels blah. My mother died in January. My next scan is in January. Will i have to change to a different TX in January? Will I continue to respond or not? What would progression feel like? Would it scare me as much as DX and TX did one year ago? That's about the only question I can answer. No, it would not. Because, after one year of reading this forum, I know there are other treatments that work, too. I'm confident that there will be something else for me to try, I had no confidence in that one year ago. So, I've grown and gathered knowledge and experience, mine and yours. That's a gift, because I don't know where else I could have gained this confidence if this forum did not exist. As each of us are trying to live life, I know sometimes it feels like too much. Our lives, outside of MBC, are sometimes sad, joyful, proud moments that happen in our family. Whichever moment is happening right now in our families, we need to feel it, be there and then move through it. That's what keeps me going, knowing some moments are more fun and meaningful than what's happening today. 💞 ",

It all worked out. We offended a few aunts, because it was so small, but it's history now and they have been happily married for almost 8 years.

I wondered where the energy would come from. I can imagine, micmel, you might be wondering the same. It was a divide and conquer thing. Short shopping trips, etc. Also, some delegating.

Especially with something big, like buying a house. You are thinking of your future, you made a decision, you pursued it, you wrote a meaningful letter, you want this. What's the worst thing that could happen? You've already thought of it, they won't accept your offer but you will come up to their price. You've made your decision, it's going to happen. Expect to have another meltdown when you sign the papers, a OMG what have I done type of meltdown. Meltdowns will be with you for a while, while you're learning how to live without your DH. Gradually, they will happen less and less often. As long as you are moving forward, you are living and learning. The muscle cramps must be terrible. I guess you have tried muscle relaxers? I take Cymbalta, it's been a wonder drug for me. Helps with anxiety and pain and mood. You are doing a good job, especially for so soon after DH death. I know you don't want to be called a widow yet. You still feel married, at least that's how I felt. You still love the man you spent your life with. That's perfectly normal. I hope there's a way you can attend your niece's graduation. You and your DH were a big part of who she has become. That's a beautiful story. Maybe that story will be in your book.",

Once major complications have happened to you, it's not hard to think it could happen again.. I like your docs attitude. He's giving you a green flag. And another 2 weeks off of Ibrance? So one month to wait? You'll have lots of wedding stuff to keep you busy.💞",

I got almost two years from Ibrance and Letrozole plus two radioembolization y90 procedures for my extension liver mets. Now IL has failed, I have new mets in lung, chest and liver. So, I will be starting on AA on Monday. Have you had this TX? I don't know what to expect. I did just have a new liver BX, hoping maybe my tumors have mutated to something different with a different treatment. For your liver mets, you might consider y90. The ones I had are called SIR Spheres. It's done by a Interventional Radiologist and worked really well for me. My liver mets were not responding to IL, they were stubborn. I'm convinced that the y90 kept them at bay till now. I may eventually be a candidate for another y90. I don't know where you live. I'm in the Dallas area. MTV IR is my doctor's website. He actually has my video, my story, on his website.💞",

Finally, a social worker at the cancer center helped me get on Medicaid for two years until I turned 65. Without that, medical ins would have eaten up all of my SS income. I'm 70 now and have managed on my small SS income. I'm most happy that I have no debt. I find my determination from wanting to do things differently than my father did. He put his children through an impossible nightmare by deceiving us and giving all control and money to the person he married after our mother died. I include my children in everything, including being on my bank account. I constantly try to make things easy for them when it's time for them to have to sell my house etc. Of course I haven't done everything I intend to do for them, but that's my plan. My DD is 46 and DS is almost 44. That's what made me think we might be close in age. Does your DS live near you? Does he have children? My grandchildren are my happy place. So much to do.....but it can be a good feeling to get things accomplished. Very satisfying. 💞",

And yet we fight on. That's what we do.💞",

I'm also worried about progression on next scan. No, not because of tumor markers, they have never been an indicator and my doc does not do them. Just a feeling based on a few facts. I try not to go there in my head, but my brain does not always do what I tell it. 😱 Anxiety should be my middle name sometimes. I'm having some trust issues with my MO. That's probably because I'm a a control freak. We all have our unique issues to deal with. So, I have no solutions to offer. But, I do identify with having to wait for scan......I seriously hate the waiting part. My brain goes in all directions searching every possible outcome and what might be next after that. Grrr it's hard to be me some days.💞",

Hmmm, that could describe all of us. Good news my scan is stable but I hardly have room to feel happy. It was yesterday when I went to my MO, knowing I would get the results. Anxious, lacking sleep and ready to confront my MO with all the issues that have impaired our communication and my trust. Discrepancies rampant. I wanted some explanations, wanted to figure out how to move forward with her. I got hard nosed reality. My intuition about the source of her attitude is now confirmed. She proceeded to tell me that she has the opinion that lay people should not read their reports. It only causes stress. What young doctor in 2018 thinks that way? Actually, that opinion alone is a deal breaker. Then she proceeded to tell me I was not embracing life because I don't have a scheduled exercise program. What? How do those two things even belong together? As you all know, I am embracing life. Where does she get off making that judgment of me? She's my cancer doctor not my life coach. I was flabbergasted. If I wanted to be analyzed I would go to someone in that profession. Another big crack in the trust She finally explained her opinion about her treatment plan. Even though my foundation one report says I am resistant to aromatace inhibitors she plans to keep me on one, even after progression. She adamantly said Ibrance is the med keeping you from progressing. She only orders AI because that's the way way FDA approves payment. So she is giving me a drug she thinks is worthless for me. For whatever reason she doesn't believe that the studies on Ibrance not working alone are true. What?! She also got my My F1 report mixed up with another patients report. She gave me advice based on the other person's results. What?! Trust down the drain. My PET report, reluctantly given to me, says there is one tumor in my chest that is taking up more uptake. Turns out its exactly where I've been having pain for the past two months. I told her about that six weeks ago. She didn't even mention the correlation to me. I figured it out. Drain flushed, I'm done with her. My drama will continue because finding a new MO won't be easy or without drama. Sorry you all got the long story, I am incapable of telling short stories.😢  ",

Surgeons are typically aggressive, I guess that's the nature of the beast. Ha But, DS says it's unnecessary to be rude, especially to a colleague, a peer. I think he's seen some surgeons be rude to his own fellow surgeons and to the anesthesiologist. DS uses respect and kindness to communicate. I'm sure meeting these two peers was unsettling, because he believes so strongly in showing respect. He sees it all the time but wasn't expecting it there at the testing. This oral testing is so subjective, it's hard to know what they think about his non aggressive approach. UGH. All he needs is a Pass (not a Fail) on this one. No scoring. DD says it's making her crazy waiting to hear the decision from her doc. So, as we all know, whatever our children feel, we feel. I'm glad I have something to distract me for the next two weeks.

I'm having my DSIL's family for dinner at my house at 1:00 today. And here I am writing and drinking coffee ( like I do almost every morning) instead of vacuuming! I still have lots to do. I decided to do this every Christmas for their family because having my house decorated and having no one see it is very sad for me. It also helps their family because none of them really like to decorate and my house is a central location. I'll never understand how my daughter did not get the Christmas decor gene. I have every Christmas type decor known to man because I was born on Christmas day. Through the years the my collection has grown. Nothing fancy, just things that remind me of the people who gave them to me. I especially miss my DH this time of year. Not just because I can't get the house lights up without him, it's just a void where a loyal, always smiling, always helping, big hearted man used to be. He was the draw for our family. He made everyone feel as if they were the most special person on earth. He was loved everywhere, at work, at church and with family. He loved me for forty years. This year, I get to go to my son's home tomorrow. This is the first time in seven years that has happened. He's been far away, during medical school and residency, but now he's here, finally. It's a real treat to be able to be with my family on Christmas Day/my birthday. I'm having a big one this year, 70 years old. Because of BC and MBC, there were times I never thought I'd live to be this old. Last Christmas I even wondered if I'd be here. I'd just been DX and prescribed Ibrance/ femara. I had sceptical faith in this TX. I didn't know if my cancer would respond. I didn't know how the SE would make me feel. Then, I found this forum. Your stories gave me hope. Then, I felt more courage. Then, best of all, I found out my MBC was responding. All of that got me to this Christmas. Here I am, able to decorate,able to have family for dinner, able to drive to my son's house, able to enjoy my grandchildren and happy to celebrate the season. What more could I ask for? Maybe a little more energy to be able to vacuum my house! Ha 🎄🎂🎅😍",

I wish they knew how hurtful saying things like that to us is. My best friend said it yesterday. I was crushed. Still am. She was talking about her niece who has ocular melanoma with mets to liver. \"Lisa has such a good attitude that she is going to get her cataracts fixed and a plastic surgeon is going to work on her eye so it will look more normal!\" I said her attitude will not cure her. Well it's been proven that it does make a difference in outcome, she said. No it has not, I said. It only makes a difference in how hard it is for friends and family. They believe that because THAT'S what they want to hear. It makes them feel better, not us. To me, it makes my job harder because I am constantly hiding what it's really like to be me. I can't even be real with my best friend because she will think I'm having a bad attitude. She also doesn't seem to believe me when I tell her how asymptomatic mets can be. Well, you seem to be doing ok so I'm sure your scans will show improvement. It's so easy for her to say stuff like that because she doesn't read this board or even want to learn what the truth is. Yes, I'm in scanxiety. Results of PET and MRI on Tuesday. I'm touchy, overemotional, selfish and misunderstood. The poor pitiful me phase of waiting and wondering what these deadly buggers are up to. Actually, I think there is a good chance that lung and chest mets will show some response to the 7 months of IF. Liver mets are another story (going in circles in my brain). I'm sure I'll make it, with plenty of valium, till Tuesday. I just won't try to share my real feelings with my best friends. Only here, with you who understand. ",

The only thing that concerns me a little is that I was told that scans of liver after y90 may not show response for several months. but your IR is the boss, so maybe he's seen it show up sooner.

I was fortunate that I didn't have little ones with my first DX. Mine were 18 and 20. But with my third DX I had 3 year old Aubrie. There was some debate about telling her. I just said Aubrie, I got too short of a haircut so I bought a wig! Her eyes got big and she said Can I take it off? I said sure. Off it came, with lots of laughter. But she did say she did not like my too short haircut either. Later we had more discussions as she aged. The most interesting one was why I didn't have a breast. She called my cloth prosthetic a poof. Lol Lynn, thanks for the compliments about the video. 12 year old Aubrie has watched it several times, too.",

I've had almost every strong chemotherapy that's out there. Yes, they were when I was younger. I have 27 years of experience with BC and MBC. Yes, I lost my hair 3 times, not fun. During the hardest chemotherapy FAC, I continued to work the whole time. It is not the scary, life altering, quality of life altering TX everyone one talks about these days. I will do it again in a heartbeat if it's the thing I need to do. In fact I may be doing it again within the next month or two. Keep hoping for something that will reduce your liver mets.

That will tell if your tumor has become resistant to hormonal therapy, like AI. Sometimes with an aggressive liver tumors, your MO might want to put you on an aggressive IV chemo for a few months to get some fast results. Of course if you want more information on y90, I will be glad to tell you about mine. Sometimes after some fast shrinking of tumors, you can go back to milder chemo pill.

One area in my chest actually showed more uptake, one a little less, multiple ones in lung are still the same, none have gone away. I'm disappointed because I had hoped for better. Stable is OK but I'm only one year into this, will my next scan show progression? That's my thought. Also, ESR1 indicates my tumors are resistant to AI, like femara. But, my doc did not even touch that subject. It would be an easy switch to faslodex. Why didn't she explain her thoughts on I that? Frustrated. Now its back in my corner to form a question that won't make her feel I'm questioning her intelligence. Also, on the F1, there's indication that my tumors are pretty aggressive and or hard to treat. There were no mutations that have an obvious targeted treatment. Lots of clinical trials though. So maybe one of those will be an option when I do have progression. It's all confusing and complicated. And, disheartening to those of us on this rocky ride through MBC.",

February is treating me better than January did, so far. My insurance check is in the bank, so maybe my DD will go car shopping with me this week. I got to have some much-needed time with my grandchildren on Monday and Tuesday. I also got to see my DS new house. It's beautiful, perfect for them. They will move in March. My DD started back to work and it's going well. I don't see my MO until March 11. I still have a few questions about F1 test but think I understand it better than I did at first. It's a hard read, then you have to put what it says in perspective. MBC is multi talented and does not follow the rule, creates new pathways and alternative ways to feed itself. Mind-boggling! After being off my TX when I had the flu, I am now feeling the effects of being back on it. But, I've been able to do what I've needed to do. Next goal, make a wise choice in buying a car.",

I wore her fancy gold and diamond watch. I wore My wedding ring on my right hand. All together, it really looked nice and held good memories with her ring and watch sparkling so beautifully.

I'm supposed to pick up kids from school and get them to their activities. My DGD has theater tonight. I hope I get to peek in and watch. It's theater for 2 hours and hip hop for one hour.

It lists study after study that correlates with much better survival time from faslodex and many other combos than with AA because of me having ESR1 amplification. It's black and white, not hard to understand. Makes me wonder if I should set up an appointment to discuss report. Maybe I caught her off guard. We have not had a satisfactory conversation about the report since I got it almost 2 months ago. I may take my friend with me who has a science background. My January scan was sort of mixed but she labeled it stable. I know lots of ladies, like me, who want to discuss next treatment options before definite progression.

I had such a strong allergic reaction to CT contrast iodine, that I don't remember anything of the first y90 procedure. The second lobe, y90 They gave me double dose of steroids so I would not react so badly to iodine. So, I'm not sure I can answer your question. When is your first lobe scheduled? No, Tanya, we had clear skies in Oahu. No smoke, no ash nothing. So thankful for that. I can hardly bear the news of all these losses here. Why so many, so close together? Holmes, heart breaking. I would be saying the saying the same, why not me, Lord?",

I focused on my report from the PET scan. I realized it's a really good report. The uptake is quite a bit less on every tumor. Now, I'm thinking that if mets will respond as much in the next four months, I could be close to NEAD. I never even dreamed that was a possibility. Of course that's if the liver mets stay no uptake. The ones in my lung and chest are still active. Does anyone know any statistics on how long good y90 results last. So far, I have had one year with no uptake. Ill have to catch up on reading, I hope everyone is doing ok.",

If you take that rule and apply it to your 13 hours of anesthesia you should not make any important decisions for 26 DAYS! Let's just say one month. Don't make any decisions for a whole month!!!

My DD is doing really well. She got to go home on Wednesday. Since her pressures were in the negative range, they adjusted the shunt to allow less fluid to be drained. Evidently, PTC can go away, I thought it was a lifetime DX. It sounds like that what has happened. Eventually, the shunt will be removed. For now it's a wait and see, and gradually close off the the valves of the shunt. I hope she'll have fewer headaches. We are not the only ones who have to play the waiting game. I just want her to feel good again. I saw my MO on Thursday and there was no drama. She did not even harp on my lack of an exercise program. Yay.

Trying to snap out of it but Ibrance is not helping. You remember how excited I was for my DS taking his last board? He got the very sad, discouraging news on Monday, he did not pass his oral boards. He has to take it again. It felt like the bottom dropped out from under me. I don't know exactly how he's feeling or coping because he said he's not ready to talk about it yet. That's it, that's all I know. I'm wondering when, if it is affecting his job or pay till he passes and how my DIL is taking this news. It's been a family team effort to get him through the last twelve years. Getting to the very end, then this? It's deflating. I know he won't quit, no way. I'm hoping he can re take it in six months, not a whole year. I'm convinced it was more of a personality problem not knowledge problem. To me, that is unacceptable. Those first two doctors who grilled him, didn't like that he wasn't aggressive and intimidating right back at them. That's not DS style. And I hope it never will be. I'm going to pray that the same two docs won't be there for his next test. They should get fired for being so utterly unprofessional. It's unnecessary and nothing good can come from that. No doctor should fail based on the fact that two of the eight doctors did not like him!!! That's just wrong on so many levels. In cases like this I think there should be an appeal process. Of course that will never happen because an oral board is so subjective. It's not like the written board, it's black and white. He passed it a year ago with no problems. The other thing that's worrying me is the repercussions of failing a board. I don't know what they are. He is an employee of a big group of anesthesiologist. He has a salary, he's not self-employed. He's on the partner track. I heard talk last year that if he failed his written board there were consequences written into his contract. It would have affected his pay, etc. I've heard nothing in regard to this test. He just started his second year with them and is supposed to get a raise, maybe they postpone the raise until he passes. The list of questions will continue to grow until he is ready to call me. Adult children are much more difficult emotionally to deal with than when they were little. So I wait. Ugh.",

But first, he does a mapping of the liver to cut off the blood supply to keep the seeds from going into other organs. That's my patient lingo, I'm sure you'll get others here to give a more educated explanation. I think I had about 8 tumors. They were in both lobes and some were harder to get to than others. My MO recommended that I go to him even though I had a lot of tumors in the liver, lung and chest. Evidently, some MOs don't suggest it in a situation like mine. Your liver numbers have to be pretty good also. I hope this helps you. It's a procedure that's done in most big cities, but try to find a doc who specializes in this local treatment.

I'm old enough to be on Medicare so no knowledge there either. But, after you have both opinions on TX and or local treatment, I'd be interested to hear what the recommended for you. ",

JFL Unnecessary trauma and serious mistakes are so frustrating. Especially to us, we're JUST fighting for our lives! That should be enough but it's not. We have to be our own advocates, too. When did THAT happen? For me it was In November of 2000. And, I wouldn't be alive now if hadn't challenged the MO and BS I had back then. (My MO fired me because I went to MDA). My BS said if I wanted to manage my own healthcare I couldn't be her patient. Yes, I never went back to either of them. If I had followed their plan, I would have died about 10 years ago.

I had about eight tumors in both lobes, so it was three procedures for me, mapping and two y90. As of August PET, none of the tumors showed any uptake. My next scan is in January, I'm hopeful it will be the same or better. I was referred to the IR by my MO. Each patient has to be evaluated to see if they are a candidate.

But, if any of it can receive help from something I\u2019ve had happen, I\u2019m glad. Yesterday morning I did something I\u2019ve never done before. I wrote my MO a long email. Yikes. I\u2019m so fearful it will come back to bite me. I have just had enough of this waiting to understand F1 report and her opinion of how to use it for second line treatment. As you know, I asked her about the ESR1 alteration and she jumped right into the AA TX might be next conversation. That panicked me. So, I wrote first that I was grateful to her for referring me to have y90, etc,etc, etc. Then I carefully got to the point. I need to understand how the she plans to use F1 report for my Next TX. At one point in my email I said, I\u2019ve had 25 years of personal experience with four DX, more than most doctors. I really meant I have truly never heard of an MO who has been DX four times. Our experience has to count for something. Of course, I carefully explained that the way I have coped is by knowing, learning and reading to find out everything I can about my cancer and treatment. It calms me down when it finally makes sense to me and I come unglued if I cannot make it make sense. So, that was yesterday morning. No response yet. Hmmm what does that mean? If she expects me to wait till April 18 appt, that\u2019s not gonna happen. I also talked to F1 and they did explain some things to me. Like, I have a genomic alteration not amplification in ESR1 DG (I can\u2019t remember the rest of the gene). I was very confused about that. Of course the rest of it is pretty easy. Very clear that my tumor is resistant to AI TX. Only Faslodex is listed as FDA approved. With lots of clinical trials all over the world. I think I understand the report better now. But, still really want to talk to my MO. I hope she calls or writes back.",

Her doc is doing more tests to check for other autoimmune diseases, but the brain MRI was clear of MS lesions. However, it did show a build up of spinal fluid behind her optic nerves. That finding indicates that her shunt ( for pseudo tumor cerebri) is not functioning properly. That explains the vision problems and headaches. If her shunt cannot be adjusted, she may have to have it removed. 😱 At least she has an explaination that makes sense.

Meanwhile, my DS is getting bids and advice about the remodeling that will have to be done on the house they bought. I don't know any details on what he's found out. But it's a huge project. I think they have big decisions to make, if the bids are too high they can back out of the offer. I think! I saw it, Fixer Upper for sure. Do any of you watch Fixer Upper? I wish they could get Chip and Joanna to come redo this house. Evidently, they don't come this far north. The program is on HGTV on Tuesday night. They redo homes in the Waco area, which is less than two hours south of here. My DD is still healing, her black eye continues to change color everyday. It's still painful, too. But, she's coming with me to doc today. She really worries about me if i get the least little sniffle. I know I'm immuno compromised, so I have to be careful. I would vote to let this run its course at home, but she won't take No for an answer. She's my Pit Bull, when it comes to things like this. I guess all of us need a pit bull on our side during MBC. No offense to pit bull owners, I believe it's all in how they're raised. All breeds can be great dogs if trained and loved. Tami takes it as a compliment when I call her my pit bull. Ha",

It fit perfectly in my small budget I set for myself ( no more car loans and payments for this lady). I'll post a pic. My son has decided I look like Gangsta Granna in my new car!

We were the quintessential family of Norman Rockwell paintings in the 50's and 60's. I won't go into TMI but here are a few words to describe my dad as a widower. Wrote his children out of his will, barred and bolted all doors, fell in love w a twenty something care giver, wanted her and children to move in w him, decided he would marry one of three women he met at dance club, got a penile implant at age 80 , married the meanest one of the three, wrote her and her son into our family trust, she cut off all contact w his children, she got Alzheimer's and started beating my dad, one of caregivers stole a huge amount of money, finally got them in assisted living and my dad died one month later, she lived many years, her son in charge of our trust, we received a tiny portion of the sale of their house. The End. So, yes I understand about staying with in laws to protect them. Yes, I understand about being the oldest. But during all of that drama, my husband was DX w pancreatic cancer, I Was DX w my third bout of B.C., my husband died the same day that I finished chemo and radiation, my dad died exactly one month later. The aftermath was, I don't even have words to describe it. All this other stuff, life stuff is not just an aside for those of us living in MBC land, it's huge. I have wished time could stop while I do this MBC thing. I plan to ask God about that when I get to Heaven. 😇",

All she's done is talk about AA. She considers my January scan stable, although it had a few that had more uptake.

Of course, we are ridden with anxiety, who wouldn't be? I do take anti anxiety meds and sleeping pills. But I can tell you it's so much easier now than it was during those eight months of DX, BX, TX and surgeries, all the time wondering if anything would work. Now I'm in a different place. I've seen the response, I'm done with procedures and I am tolerating treatment. I'm able to live in today, I've set my priorities, chosen the friends and family I spend my time with. I make plans with those people and follow through and enjoy it. I've missed out on very little. You're just not there yet. You will be. Do what you can for today.

The procedure is done like an angiogram. The doc goes in through the artery in the groin. The first one is called mapping. They have to look inside the liver to see where the all the veins are, to map out their plan of where to insert the radiation, yitrium 90. And what veins to block off so the radiation won't escape into other organs. A few days later they do the second procedure, this time they actually insert the tiny spheres of y90 into one of the two lobes of the liver. About a month later they do the same thing to the second lobe. Each procedure takes about an hour and is done as a day surgery. They use CT scan to check to make sure they have everything like they want it. They will give you conscious sedation for the procedure so that you wont feel discomfort but are still sort of awake. It's called radioembolization, if you want to Google it. Or you can look up SIRT. It's the type of radiation I had. Keetmom I hope those numbers go down fast with blood thinner and the clot resolves fast.",

Next, because it's less than three months, end of October, to the repeat scans. That's not very long. Surely all Hell can't break loose in that short amount of of time?

He haunts me and my family, including my sister. The monster is metastatic breast cancer. I, however, am living with, not dying from metastatic breast cancer. I've had four diagnoses of breast cancer ( the first at age forty four) and even though I've had six different chemotherapy drugs, countless surgeries, radiation, hormone therapy, and targeted therapy, my monster still came back with a vengeance. However, successful treatment to the metastases in my liver has given me new hope. I knew nothing about SIR- Spheres Y-90 as a local therapy to treat \"a lot of liver tumors.\" This treatment is my superhero that fights my monster. Liver tumors no longer have to mean certain death. I had my SIR Spheres Y-90 procedures 1-1/2 years ago and my tumors have been inactive since May 2017. My superhero zapped them into oblivion with the power of Yttrium.

What does it even mean in regard to an MRI report. I'm wondering if it's an area the radiologist cannot see clearly? Anyone know?",

This was many years ago and I don't remember the dosage they started me out on. I'm sure your MO will reduce the steroids before your next infusion. Take pics and call her. From my experience I now put high dose steroids as an allergy. I'm still playing the waiting game, PET on April 8. I do have a portal now so I was able to see my Monday labs on Tuesday. I had some very odd values on a few things. My blood sugar was only 50, unheard of for me. My potassium was 3.2 (bottom of normal is 3.6) this hasn't happened in years. Also my hgb, hct and rbc were all low. Odd since I'm not on any treatment and haven't been for a month. So I messaged my new MO about what she wanted to do about these issues. Her nurse messaged me back and said your labs have all been sent to your PCP. In other words, my new MO does not mess with anything that my PCP can, and has, treated me for all of these problems in the past. Okay, problem solved, right? Wrong! Fast forward through many messages all week long. My PCP did reduce one of my diabetes meds, but nothing about my low potassium. The problem turned out to be that my PCP never got my labs!!! She is at a different hospital and is not in the same system as my MO. Also, there are some big changes going on in the medical field causing her not to get FAX in a timely manner, something about coding. So, unbeknownst to me, my messages to her on my portal was her only way to get my lab values. She called me herself last night after I wrote a message expressing my frustration on how all this was handled. Especially, the potassium. I'm sure you know how dangerous low potassium can be and it has very tight parameters. A little bit low or a little high and it can be deadly. I told her I thought the MO nurse should have called my PCP when she saw that low level, not just FAX. My PCP tried to explain all the problems going on with their FAX issues and urged me not to get discouraged with my new MO. I got my potassium, finally, last night and I will have a recheck next week. There's no telling how low it went from Monday to Friday. I had no energy yesterday and have been fighting a cold all week. A day in the life, right? Our medical system needs some work.",

I was very pleased that I'm already approved by insurance and a foundation paid my co pay. It would have been $750 a month. I know some people have been denied by insurance for it. Step one is done. Now I have to see what IR says about the possibility of local treatment for my liver. That is on Wednesday. 💞",

So, confusing test results and TM. I hope the CT is correct. Sounds like it did not show progression. But, a gall bladder attack on top what you've been going through! Sounds like pain and agony. What treatment will you take when you get to feeling better? My MO treated me for a sinus infection and i am definitely feeling better. The other SE seem to be lessening. So, except for my friend fatigue, I'm ready to focus on family. I hope to get my tree up today and work on other decorating. My next scan is in January. No scanxiety for December. Yay",

You can watch my recent interview on the Will you share your Stage IV story with us thread. It explains the whole process of the procedure.",
