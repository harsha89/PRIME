My MO said 24-48 hours before and after should avoid but if feel ok then its ok to have occasional drink. I also have been doing everything I normally would be doing . I work as a school nurse and have only missed work the morning of first treatment . Pretty sure not many places more germy than my offices. MO said as long as counts stay good ok to work . I am even giving live flu vaccines to kids and staff. I had constant nausea for 2 weeks but have found if drink huge amounts of water that helps . Also if you drink alcohol would suggest 2 glasses of water for every alcoholic drink. Sadly thats literally a buzz- kill. Hope thats the answer you were looking for.",
