I had 6 rounds, and took a 10 day trip to St John between the 3rd and 4th treatments... I also worked full time and was promoted. I tell you this because chemo for most these days REALLY is doable. There are threads on here that you'll read with terrible side effects and never getting off the couch, but those are the exceptions... I read all that stuff and made a list of preventative measures I could take to make it through unscathed... or relatively unscathed. Yes, I lost my hair Yes, it is back and quite full That was my worst SE, but I had great wigs and got lots of compliments. I had a port and was very thankful, even for my 6 tx... I would not want to have been poked in the veins that many times... and I hear if you are borderline the chemo can leak and that is not good...  For the TC ladies, check out the threads: Taxotere is a Nightmare (but read it for suggestions, and don't be scared off) and Taxotere Toolbox (a thread with suggestions for combating SEs)  I would have my infusion usually on a Tuesday and then Neulasta on Thursday am... Friday was my day to rest (achey and tired) and by Saturday feeling much better. Good luck ladies and you'll be fine!!! And Jane... I had my port put in and waited to have the infusion... it took me about 2-3 days to get used to the port... just food for thought.",

Also, would you considered freezing some of your eggs before you undergo treatment, so that when you are done, you have nice clean eggs to use for IVF?? I know some women have done that. And last of all, I had chemo (6tx) and it was really just fine. Lost my hair, but its back. And I agree with whoever it was who suggested you be informed about your options. If you need or want an MX, what are the pros and cons over a lumpectomy and vice versa?? And all the recon options...

You will still need a sentinel node biopsy.. it is a surgical procedure  where they test the \"main\" node to see if the cancer spread to the nodes.They usually inject a dye in the breast by the lump(s) to see where it travels so they can identify the sentinel node. If the lumps have been removed, I am unsure how they know which one(s) are the SN.. so that would be a good question. Also, yes, you will need an oncologist... and if you need chemo its the medical oncologist who gives that to you, so you may not want to travel to Brooklyn for that... that could be very draining. You will also need a radiation onoclogist. If you just have the lumpectomy, you will need radiation. You can go just about anywhere for that. Princeton Radiation Oncology does it right at the hospital and has valet parking. I have heard of Dr McDermott... she used to work with Dr McManus (my BS) up in Somerset. My oncologist is Robert Fein in Somerset. He used to work at Sloan Kettering also, so that is one reason I chose him... plus Dr McManus recommended him... there is also the Cancer Institute up in New Brunswick - Dr Toppmeyer is an excellent oncologist...  I will PM you my phone number... please call me tomorrow and we can talk... It is all very daunting and you get this crash course in cancer. I have learned more than I ever wanted to know this past year.",

I was thinking about cold caps and when I discussed it with my oncologist, he was against the idea mostly because he said that it would prevent the chemo from getting to the scalp, one of the location mets can go... he said why go through all this just to get a metastasis to the scalp... I couldn't agree more. So, I lost my hair, bought two wigs and all was fine. I found the best way to make the wig comfortable was to wear a wig cap (about $6 at TLC online). they are skin colored. My wig boutique had given me wig tape (double sided tape) but I found that uncomfortable. I highly recommend buying a wig at a boutique where you can try them on and have them fitted. I had bought an extra wig online and it was uncomfortable and unattractive. I bought the lace front wigs and they are so real looking... I could even pull it back and no one knew I had a wig on. TINA.. your tumor may or may have grown that much in that time... I was told that the imaging is not an exact science... I had been told mine was less than 1.5cm, and in truth it was 1.9cm 2-3 weeks later. It didn't grow that much in that time... even an MRI  can't give exact measurements.",

But if they are both in the same quadrant, you may be a candidate for a lumpectomy. I brought a friend with me who took notes and I had a long list of questions... She wants the genetic test because if you are positive, you also should have a bilateral MX since you'd have a 80% chance or something of more cancer... all these tests help determine what course of action she will take with you... so yes, make a list: 1) will she do an MRI to see if there is anything else (checking both breasts, in case she only did one the first time).. also helps determine type of surgery 2) What other characteristics did she discover from the biopsy, like grade (1-3), estrogen/progesterone pos or neg, Her2 pos or neg, size of tumors 3) does she think you need chemo first, before surgery or chemo at all? 4) will she do a sentinel node biopsy before surgery or during surgery? 5) if she finds the SN is positive, does she take more nodes then or will she go back in later (and do they do a preliminary pathology while you are in the OR)? 6)If you need chemo first, how quickly can you see an oncologist and who does she recommend? 7)if you have surgery first, how quickly can that happen? 8)If you need a mastectomy, what plastic surgeons does she work with? What types of recon do they do? Where does she cut you for the MX? Jenn... I live like 20 minutes from you... who are you seeing?",

Luckily after an MRI-guided biopsy of those areas, they were benign. Had they been cancer, I would have been diagnosed with multi-centric cancer and had an MX... Important to have all the info BEFORE surgery, even if it means another MRI, with contrast.  Also, I had been told with MRI and ultrasound that my tumor was 1.2-1.5cm... reality was 1.9cm. AndI had been told I had clean nodes, from initial path report, but when the full path report came in, I had a micrometasis (trace cancer in the sentinel node). And I am in chemo... stage 1b and happy about it.  And I am a teacher. I missed some work after the lumpectomy only because I was told to, but felt fine... And haven't missed any work during chemo except for treatment day... but I could have worked a half day then too if I'd felt like it... I felt TOTALLY fine.  It sounds to me that some of your info may not be totally correct, like no stage 1 cancer patients get chemo... I would look into a second opinion from a reputable doctor or cancer center.",

I have also suffered from cysts and cancer. Its good that they removed the lumps,...so just take one step at a time. I am surprised they didn't do some priliminary pathology.By the way, what kind of surgeon did you use?? I am assuming if they removed the lumps and did not do a sentinel node biopsy at the same time that that is a good sign.",

If its done during surgery it goes to pathology, is cut in half and tested. Then they report back to the surgeon the results. If its clean, then no more nodes are taken. If it is positive, then they take the next bunch in line and test those. Mine came back negative, but final pathology which slices the sample many times showed a microscopic amount of cancer. Still, no extra nodes were needed. I would specifically ask if he uses dye and does a snb. I wouldn't want numerous nodes tested.

The plan was then to have radiation and tamoxifen and be done. I chose bilateral MX because: 1) I had a history of ADH  2) I am a worrier and knew I could not stand MRIs, mammograms that didn't work for me, and biopsies for the next 50 years 3)I had a pappilloma in my cancer breast that already needed to come out 4) I had a birad 3 in my good breast  (turned out to be nothing) 5) radiation comes with risks (heart, lung, scatter, other cancers) and by having MX I could avoid rads I looked at the whole thing as everything has risk, nothing is a guarantee, and neither path is without effort. I would either spend 6 weeks getting daily radiation and end up with potentially damaged skin, that would then compromise any future reconstruction if I chose to or had to do that... OR have a BMX and recon and recover from that... Having a MX in my mind was like re-stuffing the pillows. Same skin, just different fillers, that weren't trying to kill me. I actually had my appts all lined up for radiation and cancelled the day of, waiting til the 11th hour to make my final decision... Once I had decided (or was 80% sure) I was having the BMX, I then researched which reconstructive surgery I wanted.. In the end, I chose to have DIEP/Hip flaps, using my own fat. I had heard from too many unsatisfied implant users and so I chose this route. I always liked my breasts and the first PS I went to said that mine were going to hard to replicate.. But I found a PS who is a true artist (flew to New Orleans to use him) and I am very very pleased.  Check out the NOLA in September thread if you are interested.",

I can do anything I always did, have no pain or pulling, have 2 soft warm breasts, and all my scars are under a skimmy bikini.

My advice is to look down the road. I definitely did not choose the easy route, but knew that up front. I was willing to have a rougher route (for a couple of months) to have an easier route for the rest of my life.

My history of problems started in 1998 with ADH and I followed the path of follow and watch closely... Had my early mammos and ultrasounds... had my exams 2x a year plus my own exams... and in the end, got cancer and it had spread to my sentinel node (microscopically). After reading my path report from 12 years ago and from my MRI guided biopsies last November of other suspicious stuff just prior to my Dec 8 lumpectomy, it says I have hyperplasia (without atypia), papillomas, metaplasia, adenosis plus I am not convinced they got all the ADH 12 years ago... so who knows whats in there... Plus on my good side, the report says birad 3, follow up with MRI in 6 months. After reading all of this, plus I DID get cancer, I have been reading and reading and also feel I need to decide what to do about PBMX before radiation in June because MX becomes more complicated with radiated skin. So, if I ONLY had ADH, I would spend a lot of time researching and deciding because you have TIME on your side and can do all the MRIs/mammos/ultrasounds til you decide. And even my onc and bs don't think a PBMX is medically necessary for me, and I got cancer.  My biggest fear at this point is not about recurrance, but more about a new cancer that has already started growing...and next time maybe it will invade some other part of my body... that's my biggest fear... and my onc admitted that even with my chemo and radiation, they won't un-do any abnormal cells... tamoxifen would, but only for the ADH, not the other stuff...ugh.

I also had ADH 12 years ago surrounding a fibroid that was removed... they don't look at ADH as a surgery that needs clean margins, so I am convinced that some is still there... I have already played the wait and see game and it ended up as cancer, so I am not so inlcined to wait and see again. My onc says that with the cancer and possible ADH, my chances of cancer again are about 30%... even with chemo and radiation, and with a PBMX, my chances drop to 1-2%...  So... had genetic testing this week... if positive, my decision is EASY... if negative (more likely), I am still about 85% sure I want it for all my listed reasons. And I am not interested in a one step recon... I know someone who is not happy with theirs. I am more inclined to ask for DIEP perhaps combined with an implant... or some combo of fat and implant. I am a C/D now and just want to remain that way... One step recon has limitations... also I feel that I may have a miserable 6-8 months with recon, but I am only 48 and want it done right the FIRST time, no regrets.",

My stats are MY stats... the 30% is from my onc regarding the possibility of recurrance as a bc survivor PLUS a history of ADH (most likely still in me)... the 2% comes from the liklihood of cancer AFTER BMX (for everyone)... no MX is 100%. I have also had genetic testing (awaiting results) so if that is positive, then my stats go up... Its an individual thing. IF I have PBMX, which I am leaning toward, I am more up in the air as the the type of recon I would go with... DIEP flap or implants or a combination of both?? The DIEP would give a more comfortable results and perhaps more natural, but is more invasive... COMMENTS???",

I then went for yearly mammos and had exams twice per year for 6 years... no offering of tamoxofen.  Then the last 5-6 years my mammos showed cysts, calcifications etc, not bad, but it was enough for ultrasounds.  Now this past September I found another lump, but this time it was invasive ductal carcinoma... stage 1b/2.  My oncologist told me that by having ADH, my risks at age 36 went from 15% to 25% and had I started taking tamoxafen then, I would have reduced my risk by 45%... I wish someone had offered it to me, and knowing what I know now, I would absolutely have taken it.  Bear in mind, no family history, age 47 now, and will now undergo chemo (CT), radiation and hormone therapy (tamoxafen) since my cancer was 98% estrogen/progesterone positve (highly estrogen/prog fed)... I am also undergoing ovarian cancer screening and may have my ovaries removed. So... I still have DH (stated on my path report), still have my breasts and will decide in the future (after genetic counseling but before radiation) if I would consider a mastectomy.",

I have 97% decided to have a MX with DIEP flap recon... I have been told that my chemo and potential rads would do nothing to combat the ADH, so I am leaning toward skipping rads and going straight to the MX. And if I didn't have MX I would for sure have the pappalaloma removed, and I have already had 2 surgeries on the left side plus 2 core biopsies... I think that is enough... that breast is simply diseased and needs to go... and on my good side there is a birad 3 they want to monitor... so I say DOUBLE MX..  BRCA negative, but still...

So... prophylactic BMX or will radiation after chemo zap them? JENVANDY... just be complete in your exploration and ask lots of questions. And its true that most things on the mammo are benign... my cancer didn't even show up on mammo (did show up on US and MRI)... of all the suspect things I've had biopsied, 3/4 were benign...

The only SE I've had is my eyes are warm sometimes... I put some ice on them and they're fine... I am kind of waiting for the effects to kick in, but I assume that might be at the end of the week... i am getting my Neulasta on Thursday morning, so maybe Friday or Saturday I will need a little down time.  Or maybe I'll escape ill-effects. I did protect my nails with frozen peas and nail hardener... so I'll see if that helps.  It seems I now need to just sit back and wait for things to happen or not. I have been fortunate with my lumpectomy and port installation... little pain, no infections so I am hoping for equal outcomes from chemo!! Hugs to my fellow January chemo buddies...

I had a 1.9cm tumor and had a lumpectomy in Dec... was told chemo then rads and I would have the same outcome BUT BUT... not so true. The survival rate may be the same but the recurrance rate is not. And the survivial rate may be the same, but that COULD be after a recurrance and second round of chemo... It happens and I know people its happened to. It is a personal decision, but for me, after my lumpectomy and once chemo is done, I will have a MX instead of rads. I do not want radiation (left-sided cancer) so I don't want my heart radiated... plus the potential skin damage I find worrisome, especially if I someday needed reconstruction from a second cancer.... Plus now with all my scarring, I can' give myself a decent self exam which is how I found the cancer in the first place... and I am nt one for exams, tests and biopsies every 6 months for the rest of my life... With my situation, I have a 25% chance of recurrancce/new cancer and post MX, a 2-3%... I will have a DIEP procedure (want to do it right the first time and implants aren't for me), with skin sparing and possibly nipple sparing, so its just the tissue insde, and I will have great results.",

I asked almost every visit about recurrance and survival and local vs systemic recurrance etc... basically an obcession for me.. mostly because I wanted to make an informed decision regarding future treatment options... Also, one day, I seemed to get one set of numbers and the next visit the numbers were a little different... I think that's because its not an exact science.. Its not like, plug in your data and a number 22.3% chance pops out... too bad it isn't that precise, but you get the picture... I have been told by 4 doctors (2 BS, 1RO and 1MO) that for me, odds of local recurrance are between 5-12%, systemic recurrance between 10-15% and new cancer 14-16%... so depending on whether I am glass half full or glass half empty I have either a 29-43% chance of getting cancer again in my future... I tend to think glass half full. There are too many factprs... ",

I was diagnosed at 47 and had I been 45 it would have been covered... the glitch here is, the cancer was in there, just undetected, so I get slammed cause we didn't catch it til 47?? Not right. But I am confident we can get the insurance to cover... My lastest obcession as stated before is my fear of recurrance and making the right choices now to prevent it. When I mention BMX to my husband, he thinks I am over the top... But I point out that when my onc saw my path report and came up with a plan, he hadn't seen my MRI report, or my path report from 12 years ago... I think it paints a picture of doom and gloom and uncertain things growing in my breast.... hyperplasia, metaplasia, microcalcifiations, adenosis, pappillomas... so I am better prepared for my 10-day followup with onc tomorrow... need to hash it all out again. Has anyone had BMX with immediate recon? Pros/Cons? At least I feel the chemo is the right thing to do... some peace of mind there.",

I want my recurrance % as low as possible and local recurrance with lump and rads is like 10%, and then there is the worry of a new cancer, so with MX I can take it down to 1-2%... It helps me when there are other women who COULD have have lump and choose MX instead... Maybe I need the justification, or just the reassurance that it isn't crazy to de-breast myself even when my doctors are advising otherwise.",

He said, standard of care in US is if you have MX, and you have a smaller tumor (less than 3-4 cm) and less than 3-4 nodes, then rads aren't necessary... My case is 1.9 cm and one .38 micromet... so I am a clear case of no rads if I have a MX... he also said, even without a MX, having rads drops the percentage of recurrance from 20% to 5%... but no  one will mandate it.. But if I didn't have MX, I would have rads because those stats say I should... But for me, I will 95% have MX, not because its medically necessary, but: 1. Left side cancer, so rads would be over heart/lungs - not into heart damage 2. If I had a recurrance or new cancer, then recon would be compromised 3. I have dense breasts and now scar tissue (from 2 surgeries (1998, 2010) and 2 biopsies) 4. I am due already in May for a follow up MRI on good side, plus have something in cancer side that radiologist said should come out, so I would for sure opt for excisional biopsy of both the birad 3 in good breast and pappalloma in cancer breast... and that would be my future ... not too into that 5. Going to NOLA for Hip/Diep stacked procedure is covered under IN Network - so I should seize the moment 6. And I'd lose my love handles and belly ... not a reason to do this, but a nice perk!!

So I'd love to know how you are doing in a couple of days. For my first infusion, I plan on icing my hands and feet at infusion, and will continue my normal meds which include Allegra (in lieu of Claritin), and am thinking about going in with wet hair to keep the follicles cool, in hopes that my hair remains just a little bit longer. Sue, MaryMeg and ScienceGirl: On the feeling like I could be doing more thru chemo... I am going to try and work, but I will definitley have ME come first. My boss knows I could vanish at any time to just care for myself.  I too find the thought of this a little frustrating because I have stayed home with my kids for 18 years (just did a little substitute teaching) and was just re-entering the workforce, employed where I've wanted to work for a long time, working my way into the job I really want, and then cancer comes into my life... I have to believe there is a greater plan. I had applied for a position in August that I didn't get and had to settle for more of a stepping stone position, but now that I may need to take a leave, I feel that not getting the job of my dreams may have been a blessing. Had I had that job, I may have postponed important appointments or tests ... I might have guilt for taking a leave although I shouldn't). I totally understand feeling like I should do more, but I also know someone who did and they fell ill and into a coma and then passed away, and was a young mom... We all need to care for yourselves FIRST. Betsy",

Also, about cold caps, if you need chemo, check with your oncologist about using them.. My MO definitely did NOT want me using them since mets can go tot eh scalp and cold caps prevent the chemo from killing cancer cells in the scalp. I have no regrets. My hair is growing just fine, and I'd rather have the assurance that my scalp got the chemo than to worry about mets.

Atypia raises one's risk by 4-5 times... and I feel that since I've spent the last 13 years monitoring it and it ended up as cancer, I am no longer interested in monitoring. Plus the radiologist had recommended the papilloma come out or be monitored... I choose to remove it along with all other \"stuff'\" As for excisional biopsies, I had one right around the nipple area 13 years ago for a fibroid and ADH and you would NEVER know...

Guess I was lucky. The SN site, I did have pain and discomfort... that lasted longer... Never had LE, but the skin was sensitive. Now it feels normal too.  I think if pain went away and then came back, you either didn't have all sensation when you THOUGHT you had no pain OR you have a little problem and should tell the doctor... If the doc says all looks good, it may be that you are just healing... It hasn't been that long.",

I bought the shorter one (same as the longer one, just shorter) because i was going on spring break to st john, and was afraid i would be too hot with the long one... And the wig boutique cut bangs into the short one... Mine are both lace front, whichi love because i could pull it back off my face.. My wigs look great, and the color is blonder and more strawberry than my hair, so i may take one in when my hair is long again, and have my stylist match that color... It was gorgeous. I plan to go topless for everything, but i have my 30 year high school reunion at the emd of sept, and may choose to wear the wig... But i will need to lighten the front hair as it will po thru the lace and look funny. When i bought the wig, my hair had a lot of highlights, especially in front so it blended in just fine, but my hair is more or an ash blond, not currently sun bleached so i will need to help it along.. Maybe after another inch of hair.. Its only about an inch now... Need a little more.",

I have yet to cut my hair... feel like I need to take baby steps... when my hair starts to come out, I plan to cut it ear-length, then boy-style, and then shave... Just what I need to do for me.  And when the wig will fit more properly, I plan to go back to my wig boutique and have them trim it up.. I bought a lace front, but plan on having bangs cut into it... only got the lace front so the bangs would hang right... The first wig they got for me was the perfect color, texture and style, but when she cut the bangs, they were like fly-aways... My wig boutique has worked hard for the best match possible... with color and style... and luckily no one will have my real hair there to compare it to. I also bought a cheaper shorter wig for \"active\" days, like golfing... but who knows, I may decide that by then I am comfortable with scarves etc that would be cooler in the summer heat.",

I have gone out of my way recently to wear my hair differently so that come wig day people might just think I have once again done something different. I am fortunate that I can either go straight or quite wavy... all last week I wore my waves and then today went to work in a pony tail and straight bangs. I was kind of surprised when my assistant asked about my bangs, knowing that any day now I'll be wearing a wig... and I told her I cut bangs into my hair last month... guess she never noticed. So... maybe its only me who will notice my strawberry blond hair next week :)",

They are probably doing an excisional biopsy... with a mass that large, it just shouldn't be in you cancer or not... if they think it is benign, then go with that until you know differently. I had an excisional biopsy 13 years ago and its better, in my opinion, than a needle biopsy. And once they remove it and do some preliminary tests, they may choose to do a SN biopsy if it is indeed cancer, but that is a separate incision. Just relax if you can and remember that most lumps are benign.",

My process was starting with a script from my gynocologist for my mammo and US. Once I had my imaging, the radiologist said I needed a biopsy, which we scheduled. But then the radiologist doing the biopsy said she didn't want to touch anything til I'd met with a Breast Surgeon. I had been under the care of a BS years before due to ADH, so they called her and got me an appt the next day. She was sure I had cancer (Birad 4) and did an FNB in her office, but then scheduled an MRI. The MRI showed more suspicious things, so I had an MRI guided biopsy, but it turned out to not be cancer (the other stuff). So I then had my lumpectomy and SNB. After surgery, the BS recommended a couple of oncologists (for me to choose from) and I have friends who also had MOs, so I chose that way. I was also given a few names of radiation oncologists, again my choice. The MO (Medical oncologist) is the one who runs the show. He/she is the one to determine chemo, blood tests, scans, hormonal drugs etc. He he/she is the one you will see for years as follow up.",

If I had had the MX right from the beginning, I probably would have had implants, only because I had no knowledge of my options... and in the end I had a flap surgery... Regarding chemo, I did not want adriamycin because of the heart thing... my MO gave me Taxotere/Cytoxan, 6 treatments. Taxotere is considered a powerful drug without the heart side effects... BUT for women with more progressed BC, adriamycin/Cytoxan plus taxol/Taxotere is a better more powerful choice... I am sure that my MO would have given me TC anyway as I am stage IIa. So... are they thinking chemo then surgery? Or surgery then chemo? Because you could get the surgery and decide after which chemo to do... you need about a month to wait anyway. Ususally they only give chemo first to shrink the tumor, mostly for women trying to have a lumpectomy.. so I would start with which order you are going in, and if she is having a MX, then just have the MX... is she reconstructing if she goes that route?? I can't remember what you said.",

Your cancer was small and low grade... and I assume they got clear margins. Did you have a lumpectomy or MX? And did you have radiation?? These are all considerations regarding a local recurrance... the chemo is to help address a distant recurrance, and because they took so many nodes that were clean AND assuming you had clear margins, I wouldn't stew about it.",

Diagnosed in November... tumor was IDC 1.9cm, clean margins and one micromet in SN .38mm... so very very small. My MO decided the 1.9cm tumor warranted some chemo and the micromet made him decide to give me 6 tx instead of 4... I think my age of 48 also played a role... had I been 75, he may have chosen differently... He also decided with a positive node, there was no reason to do the Oncotype test as he wanted me to have chemo regardless... I do not regret that decision at all... Yes, I lost my hair, but I have the peace of mind to know that I have done whatever I could to avoid a systemic recurrance... and even though the node involvement was microscopic, it did indeed travel over to the node and that cancer transportation was enough reason for me to zap it before it travelled to my liver, bones, lungs etc. Good luck with your treatment...whichever route they choose for you.",

If you have clean scans, then they might decide chemo is enough... if your scans show some suspicion, maybe they will want to get more nodes... I am not a doctor of course, but am thinking that may be why they are doing the scans... so take it one day at a time.. also remember that a positive scan does not necessarily mean anything... lots of false positves, it just means they need to pursue it.

I think that is a key factor. I did NOT have more nodes taken, but again mine was microscopic and self contained... Plus a second attached node was clean... The chemo is main thing that will help kill any rogue cancer cells. I think if your mom has more nodes taken, insist that it is only the first level of nodes (I think there are 3 levels), and if they take the extra nodes and tissue and its an all clear, then radiation is probably not needed, as the standard is radiation for 4+ positive nodes. As for the vulva, I would have those cells removed now, while the extra nodes are taken, then do chemo, then maybe radiation and then hormone therapy.",

I did ask my onc why I am getting 6 and others get 4 tx and he said its because of my node involvement... had I not had node involvement then I would have gotten 4... which is sort of interesting because I thought if I didn't have node involvement I could have skipped chemo altogether... but its fine, better safe than sorry. And also, I only took Decadron before chemo, no Zofran... I have zofran in case I get nauseous, but haven't taken it yet... I also get anti-nausea in my pre-meds along with benedryl and decadron ... so... decadron morning and night day before, day of and day after and that's it for home medicating.",

For me, my concern was if I get the MX which was clearly the best way to protect myself from recurrance locally, I was concerned about recurrance regionally (in nodes, chest wall and clavicle) but all doctors I met with (except maybe RO) said that chemo would have killed the rogue cancers cells... One little caveat.. I had lumpectomy, then chemo then I will have MX... for those who have MX first, then chemo, the RO I met with said chemo is not effective on scarred tissue, so with all the scarring from a MX, the chemo won't kill the local cancer cells if they are present... I felt that this didn't really apply to me since all I had had before chemo was a lumpectomy...",

I am not in your situation, but I would guess that because you are young with an agressive tumor, you will probably get AC-T... My chemo is sort of preventative and I am getting TC... The AC-T is Ac evey two weeks usually for a period of time, and then Taxol or taxotere of maybe 12 consecutive weeks... I am not on it, and this is just from reading but maybe someone on it will chime in... That would be my guess for you.",

You are for sure between a rock and hard place. Has any doctor told you that you can continue HIV meds AND have chemo? Many drugs interact with the chemo and make it less effective... other drugs may be too harsh on the liver as the chemo is. If neither of those are the reason, I would inquire about continuing your meds and doing the chemo... I think the extracapsular extension would be good reason to have chemo, not to mention the 2 nodes.

Most, if not all, hospitals have the ability to send the mass up to pathology for a preliminary evaluation of the mass. If your hospital doesn't have this then I would consider going somewhere they do... Maybe your doctor wants to send you to a radiologist's office for a core needle biopsy and that does take a few days and they don't do SNB there... So I would start with asking what procedure you are getting. And your mass may be surrounded by other things, like fibroids, adenosis etc... because they take margins, so a path report might have multiple things listed if you have an excisional biopsy. I don't know your case enough to give an opinion accurately, but it sounds like you would benefit from an excisional biopsy with the option of having a SNB while on the table and a path report comes back... Did you say if you've had an MRI yet? That is very helpful for teh surgeon because if they know about one thing, there may be other things in there that could give them the full picture... in essence, if they see two or three areas of concern, then they could biopsy all and make a decision about lumpectomy/mastectomy etc... So, my suggestion is: *Get an MRI *Based on that result (if there is only one area of concern), have an excisional biopsy at a hospital where they can evaluate the tumor *Request SNB if they find cancer IF THE MRI shows other findings, have those areas biopsied using MRI imaging before any surgeries... that way if you have multiple issues, you have information to make an educated decision on treatment Just my opinion",

If you are BRCA + you have a 85% chance of cancer... you would want to know that before a lumpectomy. And a mastectomy doesn't have to be drastic... yes, they remove all the tissue, but there are possibilies of skin sparing and nipple sparing (a bit controversial) and the reconstruction is amazing. Having come out the other side of ADH and playing the wait and see game (post lumpectomy), I am a bit irked that I didn't do more, and won't make that mistake again. And when I say I wished I'd done more, no doctor would agree with me because I was proactive and on top of it all, except for the Tamoxifen (but no one mentioned that all these years). And by the way, neither lump showed up on my mammogram. Be your own advocate and do your homework... which you are just being here. ",

Whatever you have seen and read, mastectomies are not the enemy. There are some great options out there.

That is how it was for me even though 20% of my 1.9 tumor was DCIS. But either way, mine was under 2cm. The difference between a 1.4cm and 4.5 cm isn't as huge as you might think. Recurrance is much more likely with lots of nodes (which you don't have) and dirty margins, or vascular invasion (which you didn't have). You have had a BMX (GOOD) and ACT (STRONG and GOOD), Herceptin (NECESSARY FOR YOU), radiation (maybe overkill)... so I think you have covered your bases. I know you can't forget about the cancer, but I seriously doubt that your fatigue and other ailments are a sign of cancer. But you can indeed make yourself feel sick if you worry.

For me, i am choosing DIEP because even though its a harder surgery initially, i think the outcome will be better for my build... i am a C+ cup and if I did implants they would be very heavy and potentially uncomfortable... and might likely end up coming out... so I am choosing to go with the more invasive surgery up front with the hopes i save myself in the long run... Plus I am not overly interested in the implant upkeep... changing them out every 8 years or so. I know people who have gone with implants as the surgery is easier and shorter... but you will have fills etc before your exchange,.. i would ask Chang for a time line for both.",

I know its hard to believe now, but chemo really isn't what you probably think it is... except for the hair loss, I have felt almost 100% most of the time I was on chemo... I didn't think it could be so, but it can. And I had a feeling of empowerment on chemo... I felt like I was really doing something to kick the cancer. As far as the hair, it also hasn't been horrible. I have  a couple of really nice wigs and it makes getting ready in the morning super easy. And for more active days, I wear a bandana and go commando in my house. You are lucky you live in Maine because the one major drawback is that wigs get hot and chemo gives you hot flashes (sometimes). That being said, I am glad chemo is over and I can move onto the next step... my MX and DIEP in NOLA. The cancer journey really is a process, one I don't want to repeat, but it is what it is... and many have gone before us and unfortunately many will follow. Heed the advice of those before you and someday you will be helping someone else. Its amazing how much you will learn over the next few months. Hugs and more hugs to you :)",

I did NOT lose my lashes because of the gel... and my brows thinned to almost nonexistant, but enough was there for me to use a brow pencil. I bought all my supplies before chemo, so I could color match... Chemo really isn't as bad as you probaly think it is...

Just so you know, I had an MRI and something else suspicious showed up in a different quadrant on the cancer breast, so I needed an MRI guided biopsy (all before my lumpectomy). It came back as nothing. But it turned out to be a pappiloma, which isn't cancer, but also isn't nothing. Point is, you may have tons of tests, extra biopsies, but you do want your BS to know exactly what he/she is dealing with before surgery. Had my suspicious lesions been more cancer, my surgery at that time would have been a MX. I ultimately had a MX, but it wasn't because I had other cancer, more for peace of mind, to remove the pappiloma (which needed to come out anyway), to avoid radiation, etc.",

I also went to New Orleans like Zenful and had a BMX and GAP and DIEP flaps. My scars are almost invisable, my breasts look natural and feel warm and natural. I have zero regrets. And unlike implants, the flaps are forever with no revisions later. I have had 3 revisions on the flaps, but once I finish with tattoos in April that's it forever. I had read too many complaints of the iron bra feeling with implants, plus to get me to my natural C/D size, my implants would have been large and heavy. It's all a personal choice. Some people want a quicker surgery and that's the most important thing to them. For me, I was willing to endure a longer surgery and a little longer initial recovery, but be able to put this behind me... didn't want to be replacing implants when I'm 85.",

This raised my risk of getting cancer 4-5x (that was what I was told). At that time, no one recommended anything except yearly mammograms and seeing a breast surgeon yearly. For me, clearly this was not enough, and 13 years later in that same breast I was diagnosed in IDC with a micromet to the lymph node. I have since had a lumpectomy, chemotherapy, mastectomy and reconstruction and am now on tamoxifen. When I was diagnosed my oncologist said I could have been on Tamoxifen when I was diagnosed with ADH and it would have reduced my risk by 45%. Believe me when I say I wish I had been told that and possibly (probably) could have dodge the cancer bullet. Tamoxifen has been FINE. At first, I had some hot flashes and achey joints, but I am now 1.5 years in and have no noticeable side effects. Also, before I had my lumpectomy, I had an MRI that showed other things they wanted to investigate and my MRI guided biopsy said I had a pappilomma. The pathologist said it should come out and a second opinion BS said the same. Pappillomas are B9 but can lead to cancer, just like ADH. This was one reason I had a MX... I felt like my breasts were ticking time bombs.",

Because I still have \"things\" in my breast that are suspect and can lead to cancer, I will be discussing prophylactic MX with onc on Friday... MANY times, it does not turn to cancer, but since it has for me, I am not inclined to see what happens in the future.  I actually recently posted a thread on hyperplasia, invasive carcinoma and recurrance since I was so concerned. But as far the procedure, I have now had 2 lumpectomies (one for ADH and one for IDC), MRI guided biopsy and a couple of needle biopsies... no problems at all.

I attributed this to the fact that I went on vacation in the Caribbean then, and was swimming etc, and assumed the gel just got too wet. BUT the good news is, that as soon as chemo ended, they all came back and didn't cycle like most people. Eye lash and brow growth is different than hair on your head. It cycles (falls out) every few weeks. But not all lashes and brows are on the same cycle. So when you lose them due to chemo, it takes a while for that spaced out cycle, and many people lose them a few times after chemo. So I didn't have that.",

Well, that didn't work out for me. I had yearly digital mammos, had ultrasounds, saw a breast surgeon yearly and the gyno yearly, and after 12 years I was diagnosed with cancer that was never seen on the mammo. Only then did my oncologist tell me that Tamoxifen could have helped me prevent getting cancer. if I knew then what I know now, I would have taken the Tamoxifen. In light of my surveillance woes, I chose to have a BMX instead of the recommended lumpectomy/radiation because I feel that mammos and Us didn't work on me. I started Tamoxifen in December and really can't point to any SE. I do get hot flashes, but that started during chemo so I am unsure if the Tamoxifen is the culprit. I haven't lost weight and I have tried, but I also haven't gained weight. My knees get achey when I stand after sitting, but my knees have always had issues. I do go to spin class and zumba and have no trouble, so perhaps my knees are just being 49 and having a history of lots of tennis (that put me in PT when I was much younger). All I can say, is that it is a personal decision, but ask yourself how you would feel if you could do something to prevent cancer, didn't do it and then got cancer. Cancer sucks. Chemo sucks. Being bald sucks. I forever have the \"big C\" hanging over me. Not fun.",

So let's say the BS says you can have a lumpectomy, then you have the MRi and it shows another lesion. If they biopsy the lesion and its cancerous, then you are more likely a candidate for a MX. Better to know this prior to surgery. As for timing. I was diagnosed 2 years ago, had lumpectomy, chemo and then BMX and DIEP and GAP flap recon. I worked all through chemo, even traveled to St John for 10 days. I was back at work 8 weeks post MX and had no pain. So for me with all that surgery and chemo, I was \"in treatment\" or recovering for about 10 months. I have since had a revisional surgery and another one next month, but it really didn't affect me. I think some surgeries/reconstructive options can be ongoing, like getting TE and then needing fills and then replacement with implants... and then doing it all again every ten years. Hair... so here I am 2 years post diagnosis and have a full head of long hair. I went without wig and scarf just 2.5 months post chemo ended. And sported a funky do 4-5 months post chemo.",

Flip side, if it is indeed cancer, you are doing all the right things... just one step at a time and remember, don't assume the worst until you know for sure.",

Remember everyone is telling you that you are currently in the worst time of diagnosis, in the phase of learning where you are at... you will be amazed at how much easier it gets once you have a plan and start working on that plan... its hard when you think you aren't doing anything and the cancer is still in you ... but don't rush into surgery... make sure you have all of the details and proper tests before hand so you can make informed decisions... one week, two weeks isn't going to make a difference.",

If chemo were to leak on the skin, then it severly burns it, so if the catheter was put in an artery instead of a vein, does it move it around the blood system the same way..and not leak the toxic chemicals in the wrong places?. Arteries and veins move blood in opposite directions, so did it take the chemo to the heart?",

I had many doctors encouraging me to go with the lumpectomy/radiation route, but I chose mastectomy for a few reasons: 1) by having a MX, I did not need radiation, which I can still use if I ever have the need... Plusi there are definite downsides to radiation, especially with a left-sided cancer (heart side). 2) I do not now need to have MRIs two times a year to monitor myself 3) I have a much less risk of a local recurrance, going from maybe 15% to 2%. And considering the fact the mammogram never found my cancer, I knew I'd have trouble sleeping at night wondering what was brewing down on my chest wall, an area I wouldn't be able to self monitor. Plus, I had a pappiloma on the cancer side, so surgery was in my future no matter what. Something my first BS didn't mention to me. And they were watching something on the non-cancer side. Plus, I had a history of ADH. My point is, everyone is different and has their own set of reasons for making certain decisions. But had I just blindly followed my doctors, I would have had a lumpectomy and radiation and am 100% sure I made the right choice for me to have a mastectomy. So even though with either route I might live to be 100 years old, the path to get there might be very different with the different treatments. I was not willing to go through it all again. Do note, I had chemo too... and really wanted to do everything I could now to avoid a recurrance so I wouldn't spend another year of my life in chemo and recovery. For me the MX was the best decision I made. No regrets.",

My MO didn't do the oncotype because he said its not for node positive women... And even though we are mildly positive, we are positive. So even though your tumor/cancer type is less likely to recur, that is completely unrelated to chemo. Chemo's job is to kill any rogue cells that may have escaped the breast... and since it did go to the node, you run that risk. For me, I didn't want to take any chances. And for you, 4tx is 3 months of chemo... Small investment of time for a future of some protection. I won't try to convince you, but chemo has nothing to do with recurrance liklihood and has everything to do with killing cells that could metastisize...",

I have a friend who had two lumpectomies and then mastectomy in search of the clear margins....\"clear enough\" would bother me. As for the nodes, I asked about having more out and my surgeon said that with a MICROMET, there was no need... that she was 99.9% sure that my other nodes were clean... plus my sentinel node had a second node attached to it and it was clean. How much was your sentinel node involved? If the involvement is less than .2mm, that is considered as basically negative... .2mm - 2mm is considered micromet... above 2mm is considered positive. I am doing chemo to MAKE SURE no little cells escaped, so maybe that is enough for you too.  I know lots of people who have had complications from the node dissection ",

If positive, you will most likely want to consider a BMX, as BRCA + means 80% chance of cancer... And a last piece of advice, if you do have cancer, and do want/need a MX, take your time in choosing reconstruction. There are MANY options out there, most of which will not be suggested to you by most plastic surgeons.
