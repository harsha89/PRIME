I had a BM, started Tamoxifen, then reconstruction and a total hysterectomy. My Oncologist didn't do the Oconotype test and didn't give me a % of recurrence. She also has never suggested anything with regard to lifestyle to prevent the BC from coming back. At first I was a little put off by this, however, after researching women with BC, I think she was wise. She doesn't know exactly what causes BC or how to prevent its return and to suggest she does and to tell me so, would make her a liar. Lifestyle changes are good, don't get me wrong but it can't be food, exercise, etc., everything that is buzzing around. Too many women die of BC that eat healthy diets, are thin or healthy weight, overweight, exercise, never eaten meat, etc. I believe its something in our environment that causes cell mutations and stress levels. I also thought once I hit the 5 year mark, my chances of recurrence would go down but my Oncologist said that is true for women with other types of BC, example, triple negative BC is more likely to come back in the first 5 years. Hormone receptive BC is more likely to come back after the 5 years or later. I don't put much stock into the Oconotype tests, one just never knows if their cancer will come back or not. I have seen women with good chances for survival, pass on and women who surpassed statistics. Blessings!    ",
