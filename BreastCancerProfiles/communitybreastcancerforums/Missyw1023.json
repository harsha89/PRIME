A few minor side effects- shaky for the first few days after treatment, day 3-6 I was soooo tired and just didn\u2019t feel good. Day 3 was the worst- stomach cramping was so bad I spent the day crying and praying. Drinks don\u2019t taste the same, neither does ketchup. I also have a constant slimy feel in my mouth. Gross!! No hair loss yet, but I had to shave my head due to a terrible mishap of color and overprocessing. I was trying to go shorter and shorter and add some fun, but it dried it out too much and was like having a bed of straw for hair. Yikes! I have 2 awesome wigs now- I just need to feel comfortable within myself to wear them and not feel like everyone is staring at me.",
