Three paternal aunts died from breast cancer and four paternal cousins have experienced it. I had my first mammogram in 10 years (no insurance) the 3rd of Jan. 2015, a mass was found behind my nipple on my right breast. Had follow up mammogram and ultrasound done Jan. 22nd. It was still there and measures 1.2 x 0.7 x 1 cm and it .8 cm behind the nipple at the 12 o'clock position. A core biopsy was done on Feb. 17th and I was told the result would be available on the 20th. When I called on the 20th I was advised the pathologist had ordered additional slides. I am curious as to why additional slides would be ordered....does anyone have any ideas? I am trying not to worry too much but as a widow with a special needs 10 year old who has been in the hospital since April 2014 I am feeling pretty stressed right now..... Thanks in advance for your time and answers Log in to post a reply",
