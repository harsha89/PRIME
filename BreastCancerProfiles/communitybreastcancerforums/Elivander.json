    "Content": "Elivander wrote: Hi everyone, Has anyone experienced a small lump (mine is probably about 4mm) that is suddenly painful that isn't cancer? I started having pain in my chest a few days ago, like someone punched me or I pulled a muscle. When I was rubbing the area, I discovered the lump. It's tiny, but it's definitely painful when I rub it. I don't know if it's important, but I started my period today, so hormones could be affecting me/it. Any insight you could offer would be appreciated. Thanks! Log in to post a reply",
