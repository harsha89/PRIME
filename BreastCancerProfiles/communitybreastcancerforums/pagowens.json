My hand and arm are noticibly colder than my left but no perceptible swelling during the tingling.   In fact my arms and hands look identical and as always - nothing like the pictures shown in this thread.  As the day goes on, the tingling and coldness stops. I know that I read somewhere that tingling is a very early sign of lymphodema.  I called my oncologist office right away and asked for a referral.  I called that referral (physical therapist where I went for a baseline during rads) and the therapist who answered the call thought this was NOT lymphodema but that I must be \"sleeping on my arm or with my wrist at a wierd angle\" and she suggested I get a wrist cockup at the CVS and try that. OK - I know I am somewhat more \"sensitive\" than the normal person on the potential lymphodema, but if y'all could just advise me on these symptoms: 1.  My arm feels different than before - not \"heavy\" not swollen, just wierd 2.  The tingling/cold has happened only in the morning when I wake up and lasts about an hour, but there is also a \"pressure\" feeling internal to my arm midway between my elbow and shoulder - like something was pressing on it, cutting off the circulation.  But I don't feel any lumps or constrictions in the arm itself. 3.  My lumpectomy was on my right boob and bigger in cm than expected.  So now I have a hard \"fuild filled\" cavity on the \"outside area\" of my right boob facing directly across from the pressure point in my arm.  I figure they must be \"related\" like on maybe pressing on the other during sleep --- but maybe that's my imagination as well.  If I sleep on my right side I am uncomfortable because the fluid filled cavity hurts. The therapist told me to try the \"cockup\" and if that doesn't work to come in.  I'm hesitant now to do anything and think I might be overimaging the situation. But I'm not a hypochrondriac and know I'm not imagining the symptoms. Any advice? Pat",

When the h.ll did pink philanthropy become a line-my-pocket business?  Educate yourselves.  Go to www.guidestar.org, register for free and check out the form 990's of your favorite charities - including the pink ones. They are not hard to read and compare the current year (2009) with the previous one.  Generally several years are listed.  The Form 990 is an IRS required submission and comes from the charity's audit materials, filled out by independent audirtors.  The first page is a summary, but you can scroll through the form and find the \"top executives\" pay - the name, salary and benefits are listed for each key employee. Now, I work in the nonprofit world and am not opposed to a decent salary for hard working staff.  But I think a couple hundred thousand a year is more than sufficient for a charity leader (no matter how big the charity) to live a comfortable life.  A half million in salary is way beyond comfortable. I resent that my and other diseased boobs are being used this way. Pat",

And, I totally get why this procedure is better than scooping out all the lymph nodes and tissue, but it isn't a procedure that should be done without some anesthesia choices.  Besides the physical pain (which did subside after about 2 minutes), there's the emotional issue of injecting stuff into your nipple.  I couldn't look.   And, I don't think the numbing gel did much - I taped on both nipples prior to the injections to see if they felt different....and they really didn't. SoCalLisa, I think you were blessed that it didn't hurt.  The radiologist stated to me before injections, \"You know these are painful, right?\" and the nurse coordinator also told me they were painful.  So, I think by their warnings to me that your situation was more unusual than usual. I haven't seen any information on these injections in any postings and in any materials.  I wish I had seen/read something prior to my experience.  The silver lining is that after that experience, I figured if I could stand the acid boob test, I could stand anything they could throw at me!

I'm finding the biggest challenge is to get up the energy to do this every morning (7:50 am appt).  I can see it is another endurance test.  My skin is doing fine, so far, but the woman who goes in right after me is about 10 days ahead of me and her skin is not doing so fine.  So, I'm getting pretty nervous about it.  I've been using cocoa butter, Lubriderm, a cortisone cream with aloe (anti-itch), and Eucerin topped with a spray of Solarcaine with aloe.  I know that's overdoing it - but I'm hoping one of them is working long term.  At the very least, decorating my radiation area with all this goop keeps me distracted from whatever sizzling stuff is going on inside. I'm wearing my regular bras to work daytime because, quite frankly, I need the support.  At home, they are off and I'm not wearing any bras.  It's my right boob along with underarm for the lymph nodes so the machine positions to 9 oclock, 12 oclock, 4 oclock and also 6 oclock.  It took me a while to realize that they are radiating my clavicle from the back....hmmm.  when I see the doc on Monday, I'm going to find out why.  I'm worried about my lungs.  One funny story:  Every morning for radiation treatment I go into the changing room and take off my top and bra and put on the hospital gown and the warm fuzzy robe they gave me as a present the first day.  On the table in the rad room it's just the gown with the right arm out and right boob exposed along with my pants and shoes.  So, last Friday, I got changed, got in the rad room and took off my robe, as usual.  The tech looked at me and said, \"Hmmm...why don't you have your pants on?\"  Yup, I looked down and there I was in my bright red underpants - no pants on.  \"Hmmm\" I said, \"I have no explanation for that.\"  We laughed did the treatment and I got dressed and went on with my day. Next treatment day the tech smiled at me and said, \"I see you remembered your pants today.\"  I laughed and got on the table as usual... but what she didn't know was that all the way to the center I kept repeating to myself, \"I must keep my pants on...I must keep my pants on...\" Chemo brain must be the longest remaining side effect! Nice to meet y'all, Pat",

Any questions?\"  Everyone today, even the receptionist, congratulated me for \"making it through and getting done.\"  So, I think I was pretty lucky with my radiation/oncology team.  I also had a very kind and thoughtful oncology group.  You certainly need that type of team in this fight! Thank you all for being supportive - I can't imagine going through this alone...without others to share and vent.  In a week I start taking Femara.  I'm ready to get on with my life and not have the cancer rule every day's work.  I'm sorry that breast cancer has taken away my sense of future, but I'll cope with that and look forward to waking up in the morning and not thinking about this stuff first.

I guess I'm a lucky person because I finished #25 of the 33 today and go to boosters only tomorrow for the last 8 treatments directed to my scar area only.  My boob area is pink/tan and my nipple is brown with brown dots while the unradiated one is pinkish with tan dots - so they don't match.  My front shoulder area is where I've got some burns - kinda in lines from top to near boob, and the upper part of my back is also rawish.  But some itching, not awful and no blisters.  The Aloe is helping alot, so is the cortisone cream (with Aloe) and I smother the area in Eucerin during the day and at night apply the Lubriderm all over really thick.  But, I think the Italian genes from my dad probably are helping the most.  I've always had somewhat olive skin and never really burned in the sun. Changed my avatar today to show my chemo friends where my hair-grow is. It's nice to celebrate things like...my hair is growing finally - no more wigs, my chemo port comes out on Friday, my rads are almost done, my vacation in Sept is booked.  Yippee!

The \"only\" burn is on my front shoulder blade - just on the inside of my bra strap.  Not bad for 29 radiation treatments.  I'm glad that I still don't have the blisters or the terrible side effects some of you are experiencing - my heart goes out to you!  I'm really getting antzy to get this done!  I can't wait for next Monday. I got my chemo port out last Friday, so the left side is swollen and hurts now (still) and is trying to outdo the right radiated side.  The surgi strips itch and I'm disclored around that.  If anyone is thinking about getting their port out, I was surprised to find it was done under a local.  Stupid me thought - local...not bad..just one needle prick and viola!  Out comes the port.  Nope, it was about 20 needle pricks to numb up the entire area...owiee!  Like having a bunch of bees stinging your chest.  Then I could actually hear the incision (I kept my eyes closed) and the doc saying things like, \"OK, I have the vein out now, please clamp here\" and \"umm... the port developed a little egg shell around it, that's interesting\"  \"OK, I'm going to have to pull hard now...you'll feel some tugging\"  Tugging?  It was like my chest was being pulled outside my skin.  During this procedure he cauterized me several times...the smell of your own skin burning!  Being a silly goose, I said, \"I always thought I was SMOKING HOT.\"  And, then, I actually felt the last two needle stitches - ouch!  The doc said, \"Sorry, I guess I should have given you a bit more there to keep you numb, but it's all done now.\"  So, my advice to anyone else getting this done....ask to be put out! But, that said, it wasn't as bad as the pre-lumpectomy 4 needles in my nipple to inject the radiation and dye for the geiger counter to find my lymph nodes during the surgery.  Nothing to date has outdone that doozy.

Leklovessrk - what a nice person your doc is and how lucky to have a very positive experience like a wonderful cruise before this one.  Last December 31st my husband and I toasted 2011 because we knew this year was going to be a bear.  And, it has been.  We're planning a vacation in September - post rads.  We truly need it.  I'm not even thinking about the 5 plus years on Tamoxifen yet...one step at a time seems more bearable. I'm going on to my 14th treatment this morning.  The only side effect so far is that I'm really tired at night and in bed no later than 9 pm.  I don't know why the rads make you so fatigued - I guess it's the body repairing itself and all the stuff inside working hard to do it.  My skin is ok so far as well.  I have been having some shooting pains in my right arm at night and the doc says it's another side effect of the body trying to repair itself and is normal.  I'm having a lymphodema evaluation anyway this Friday, just to make sure it's not the beginning of that. I did ask the doc yesterday why I'm getting radiated through my back and what's happening to my lungs as a result.  Apparently because of my lymph node involvement, they need to radiate my shoulder area and if they only go through the front, it causes a lot of scar tissue.  Hence, they go through the back to lessen that impact.  A little portion of my right lung (top inside part) is affected but the doc says it's very rare to have damage in the lungs from the amount I am getting.  So, I felt better about having at least 90% of my lung not being radiated...hey, what's a little 10% being affected?  If I add in both lungs I've got most of what I need.  :o) I can say that even though this journey seems pretty scary at times, I see some folks have it much worse.  For example, I finally asked what those big scary looking masks were in the rad room.  The tech told me it was for those patients who have brain cancer.  OK - that trumps my boob! Bailey 1958 - it's ok to have a pity party every now and then.  This stuff is pity-able.  I've found that trying to keep your sense of humor helps - and there seems to be plenty of stuff to find dark humor in during chemo, surgery and rads. And, if that doesn't help - they've got pills for it (they've got pills for everything!). BTW, when I joined breastcancer.org I chose Wonder Woman as my avatar because she was a strong, smart, and courageous warrier.  Her story was that she came from a tribe of Amazon women and the Amazons (legend has it) burned off their girl baby's right breasts at birth so that they could wear their armor and develop strength in their right arms and shoulders. So, although Wonder Woman has two good looking boobs, most of the Amazon women looked more like me with one fully developed boob on the left (what I call \"me\") and one smaller right boob (what I call \"mini-me\").  So, you're right Bailey1958, we are warrier women. Hey MagPag - your story is pretty funny!  We should figure out how to collect all these stories to make other breast cancer women laugh, too.  Pat",

However, a woman who was ahead of me in rad treatments and just after my appointment everyday found that using the gel/juice from an Aloe leaf was very soothing...and she was having major skin issues. I was trying to figure out how to get an Aloe plant when I stopped yesterday at a nearby produce store, viola! there was a gigantic Aloe leaf for sale! So, this huge Aloe leaf came home with me and I truly didn't know what to do with it.  Thank goodness for the ability to google.  I found a site that demonstrated how to fillet an Aloe leaf and mix up the gel and juice for a refrigerated bottle of 100% pure Aloe.  And, now I stand at the refrigerator with my blouse up putting Aloe on my boob and shoulder.  It feels great and so does the cold air.  :o) I am also a private person and didn't tell anyone right away.  It was only me and my husband knowing until just before my surgery.  My children are adults, so I made sure to tell them in person so I could answer their questions right away.  Each reached differently - two very supportive, two ignoring it because it's too scary to think about.  I only told my boss at work just before my chemo started because I knew I'd have to take off from work.  He's been wonderful.  I didn't tell anyone else, but they found out anyway.  Everyone seems to respect that when I'm at work I really don't want to talk about it.  Occasionally I'll get a \"how you doing?\" and I say, \"great.\"  The biggest shocker was the first time I didn't wear my wig to work.  I had been wearing it from February and had my hair cut in the same style in early January....so the change of \"do\" happened before I went bald.  The 103 degree weather in early July did my wig in  for me and although my hair is maybe an inch long I went au natural.  My hair was dark brown pre chemo and came back mostly salt with some pepper post (as did all the hair on my body turn white - eyebrows and eyelashes came back in white).  I didn't dye before and don't have the energy to do it now.  So, even though I never said anything, it's very clear that my body has been through a major change. Most folks are very complementary...but, at work I still really don't want to talk about it. I've been lucky not to get any stupid comments - except one funny instance.  We (my husband and 4 year old grandson) went to Appelbeas in early June for dinner to celebrate my last chemo session.  I had my Wonder Woman ball cap on (no wig) and a shirt over a tee.  I kept my ballcap on because at that time I had some fuzzy new hairs and still some bald spots.  I was looking down at the menu when the server came over and said, \"OK Gentlemen what can I get for you tonight?\"  I looked up startled and then he went...\"Whoops, I mean Ladies and Gentlemen!\"  So, there you are ... that's what I really looked like, one of the guys!  Most folks have been very kind.  Forgive them their stupidity. Unfortunately, my appetite is fine.  I've gained 6 lbs since end of chemo (had lost 13 lbs).  I've got to start exercising when this stuff is over. I will not be taking Tamoxifen - because I am postmenapausal, my onc prescribed Femara (an aromatase inhibitor) for me.  I start that the week after radiation ends.  And, I think I'm on that forevermore.  Hopefully it works and I don't experience the bad side effects that could happen (arthritis, edema).  Hugs to all.  Stay strong Pat",

She gave me a bunch of information on lymphodema. I went to a medical supply place and got fitted.  Copied the fittings down and then shopped around for a best price - which was on the internet.  Wore the sleeve for my Sept trip - put it on in the airport waiting room right before boarding, took it off right after boarding.  No problems.  I think we're all different with different \"cases\" and there is no one answer to any of this.  Just our best judgements about things.  I tend to be conservative and err on the side of prevention.  But I still life heavy things (including my grandson) which you're not supposed to do either.  Just trying to live a balanced life!

For my last chemo I did bring an Incredible Edible fruit display to the nurses.  I figure I'll go out tomorrow and find something for the techs for Monday.  It's a much smaller group, so I'm figuring some tasty stuff and sugary with a card to say thanks for keeping me going.  It's my last session with the doc as welll, so I'll have to ask him re follow ups - I don't know what to expect.  What are you guys doing at the connclusion -- any good ideas? As for my body, my shoulder and back are peeling and a bit itchy.  Just dried out skin.  My boost area is dark reddish brown - not burned but sorta looking like a big bruise.  My right side (radiated) is very different looking than my left side - it looks like two different people.  I have no idea how long that look will last, but I'm betting a good year for my skin to look normal again on my radiated side. I received my Femara pills (90 through the mail in prescription) on Thursday.  They are very small for pills that pack a big punch and I think I have to take these pretty much forever...not just the 5 years like Tamoxifen.  Because I am post-menapausal (57 years old - started menapause at 50), the aromatase inhibitors are supposed to work better....but they are likely to bring on bad arthritis.  So, I am also figuring that I have to start doing some strength exercises after Labor Day.  I totally understand the statement that \"I feel old\" because I swear my body has aged 10 years after going through chemo and radiation.  I know that I look older and my body feels beat up.  I'm hoping with time that I'll regain my old vitality.

My skin is almost back to normal now - 6 weeks post rads.  Still a darker color than the other side and still some \"leathery\" spots where I had burns but much, much better. I'm on daily Femara and seem to be tolerating that well.  Used my \"lymphodema\" prevention sleeve (if you have lymph nodes removed) on the plane rides and that seemed to work well.  I'm still more fatiqued than pre-BC and am working on building up endurance.  I figure it will take at least as long to \"heal\" and recover as the treatment took.  So, my goal is to be back to feeling better and younger (feel much older right now) by next August.
