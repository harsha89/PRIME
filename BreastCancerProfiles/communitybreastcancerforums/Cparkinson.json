I know about the waiting, I went through that about 5 years ago. I had a lump in the right breast, but it was also very painful; so they could not test me for a bit. It was so tough to NOT know, and to keep trying to live a normal life until you find out! I was fortunate in that it was a blocked milk duct only, and that may be the case for you.
