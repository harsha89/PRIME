Help -  I'm feeling a little hopeless here.  My doctors still say there is a chance for cure but I didn't ask them the odds of survival.  Has anyone else had a large number of nodes removed and/or positive and how are you doing?

Did get some good news from my oncologist.  My bloodwork was back and all my numbers were in the high normal range including my wbc.  The other good thing is they said my tumor had \"shrunk considerably\" and after only one treatment. So I guess poisoning our bodies really does pay off. How did everyone else's tx go today?  Hopefully they were uneventful also. Good luck to all the warriors having their first tx tomorrow.  As many of us have said on here, the anticipation is much worse than the tx.  S/E can be a little sucky but they will pass.  Make sure you tell your doctor about them - there are drugs for everything. MOB - all I can say is WOW. Okay off to bed - as uneventful as today was, I'm still worn out.",

I did lose it a little but then my dh reminded me that this was just temporary and I used to say I would love to be able to shave my head and start new. Yes, be careful what thoughts you put in the universe lol. For those of you that have been though more than one treatment - I remember reading that the first tx is usually the longest.  Mine lasted about 4 hours.  How long do you think the second will take.  I'm on Taxol only.  Don't want dh there the whole time - he means well but he does make me crazy at times.  Besides I love the Benedryl nap. Okay off to catch up on the posts. Sleep well my sisters....................................",

And since I'm close to you, where did you get your wig? buddy1 - I know what you mean about needles but these would be good needles. What a great way to end our treatments. tat ladies - Would sometime in October work for our trip?  It ties in with the Breast Cancer 3 day walk.  Maybe we could figure out how to make it into a fundraiser too. Any ideas on that?  With some help, I'm more than willing to take the lead on this.  I already have someone working on a design and will get in touch with the Miami Ink guys too.  I went to college in Miami and loved it there - going back 30+ years later and getting a tat makes me feel like it's another new beginning for me.  Does anyone have any ideas of suggestion about the design.  Anything you like or don't like?  I was thinking something with a warrior design but something feminine too.  I'm kinda over pink ribbons but this tat is something we all have to agree on.  You can pm me any ideas or suggestions. I totally agree about the wig thing.  I HATE mine but I haven't felt comfortable enough to go to work without it.  As soon as I get home my shoes and my wig come off.  I've gone out a few times with just a cap or a scarf but still feel self -conscious. Good luck to anyone having tx tomorrow.  Wishing everyone a se free weekend. Enjoy Easter, Passover, or just being alive.  Hopefully the weather warms and we can get out and soak up the Vitamin D.  I'm having my 3rd tx Monday and hoping I can talk the doc out of the Neulasta shot.  I'm getting an award at work on Thursday and it's a pretty big deal.  Also getting $500 and was wondering what to do with it.  Wanted it to be for something special for me so I'm thinking it would be great for the Miami Ink trip.  I'm also going away for the weekend and do not want the Nuelasta pain.  My wbc has been really good so I hope that works in my favor. I'm just on Taxol right now - no A/C yet, that comes later.  Has anyone else go an okay to skip the shot? I know we all have our good days and our bad days and none of us want to be here - but if this hadn't happened to me I never would have met such a caring, compassionate, and wonderful women.  I was having a feeling sorry for myself day Monday - we were taking my daughter out for her 21st birthday and I was feeling sad that I may not be around to see my grandkids.  I will fight like crazy but I am more aware of my mortality.  Anyway chemo brain knocked me off my train of thought - my point was ther was a women in front of us waiting for a table.  She was in one of the wheel chairs that are a lot more padded than a regular one and had lots of gadgets.   She saw me looking at her and she nodded her head and smiled.  It was like she knew I was sick and was acknowledging me.  It was a tender moment but it made me realize how lucky I was.  I can walk and talk and breathe on my own. I may be bald and bitchy but there will be an end to all of this  well maybe not the bitchy part lol.  Now matter how bad we feel, look around and see how truely lucky we really are. Off to soak in a nice hot bath,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,",

You sound like you are tolerating it well.  What anti nausea meds are you on and do you have any tips? chick717 - hope you are feeling a lot better. sakura - I TOTALLY agree with the Biotene mouthwash.  I use it faithfully and other than tx my taste buds are pretty good.  Water still takes like water but I do get a salty taste once in awhile. I didn't realize they had gum so I'm going to look for it tomorrow. Now the Miami Ink thing - We have to do this.  I'm wondering if TLC or A/E or one of those reality chanels would do sponsor it or do it as a special.  Maybe they would even design a tat for us March Warriors.  I'm definitly up for another one especially symbolizing our journey.  If you all are serious about this, I can do some research and maybe write some letters.  What a great way to get all of us together.

Just had my 2nd treatment and it's pretty easy.  My onc prescribed heavy duty steriods the first time which made me feel like Wonder Woman - the steroid crash headache sucked a little but nothing Tylenol didn't help.  Took half the amt of steroids the last time and things were fine.  From what I understand, the Taxol infusion takes a little longer than the A/C infusion - I was in the chair at noon and done by 4:00.  First they give you Tagament and then Benedryl because of allergic reactions.  For me the s/e are minimal.  I get the Neulasta shot the day after treatment and that causes bone pain for me too.  Women on here suggested taking Claritin and that really helps.  Even though the box says take one per day, take two the day of and the day after - what is one more drug in our systems.  I have the infusion on Monday and take Thursday off from work mostly because I have a lot of sick and vacation time so I figure why not use them but I really could go to work.I have anti nausea meds but haven't had to take them. Hope this helps - if you have any other concerns, please feel free to pm me.  Any A/C suggestions/hints you have would be greatly appreciated.",

My hubby buzzed my hair the other day and I've been wearing a wig to work and I hate it.  It's too hot and I don't think it fits right but I ordered it online and it didn't cost much so I guess I can't expect much.  I have an appointment at a wig salon tomorrow so hopefully I find one that I actually like.  I ordered a couple tee shirt material caps from Ebay and wear them around the house and got a free scarf from francelux.org and it's beautiful.   If you haven't ordered one yet please check out their website and call Francine - they are no charge to anyone suffering from hair loss. I always wondered what I would look like bald and now that I am, I'm not liking it very much.  I think I have an odd shaped head.  Maybe due to an excess of brain matter lol.",

We probably need to know approximately how many of us we are talking about before contacting Miami Ink or TLC who produces the show.  Since we are talking about doing this in October - which  btw is a great month for Miami - we need to know soon.

When I asked the radiation tech about the treatments she said my radiation treatment was \"complicated\".  Now I'm wondering how sick I really am.  My Onc and BS both seem optimistic about how I am doing but now I'm starting to wonder if that is just to keep me optimistic.  It was my understanding from the BS that surgery went well and she got all the cancer and I had clear margin that didn't extend anywhere but the lymph nodes.  What freaks me out about that is she removed 43 nodes of which 19 were postive.  Isn't 43 nodes way too many?  She said she only removed the front clump of nodes and mine just had a lot in it.  I looked on here and can't find anyone else who had that many nodes.  I was making plans for next summer but now I'm wondering if I should plan that far ahead.  This so isn't like me - I've been the one with the great attitude. I'm also having residual side effects from the chemo.  The nails on my biig toe have been ridged and discolored for months and yesterday the one nail fell off UGH. Does this ever end? Should I be freaking out or do you think I'm just being sensitive and reading into things? Thanks, Michele",

Did have a question though and I think jdeking kinda touched on it.  I haven't had surgery yet and even with only one treatment, I've noticed a change in my breast. It seems a lot lumpier almost like a cellulite feel. I have ILC which doesn't show as a solid lump but more of a mass.  Is this normal or maybe a good thing?  The other thing that's bothering me is a \"full\" feeling maybe in the uterus.  It feels like 9 months pregnant when the head is pressing on the cervix.  Anyone else had that?

I got the call from my doctor and GUESS WHAT.........  The results were not conclusive again.  He said 'They found some cells, which is fine.  There are always some cells in bone.  The cells were very damaged (by the procedure, and the preparation of the specimen) so they could not tell much by looking at them under the microscope.  They stained them for keratin, which is something skin cells make, and a few of them took up the stain.  They say that means those cells were skin-like, and that makes it less likely for it to be a simple benign bone tumor, and increases the worry about spread of the cancer.  But only a few of all the cells they saw took the stain - all the rest of them did not.  Maybe they got carried into the area when the needle went through the skin and layers beneath to get to the bone.  I simply don't think the information from the biopsy is enough. ----  Now they want to do an open biopsy to get more this time by a Neurosurgeon.  I totally trust my doctor and know I am in very good hands since my specialists are all top docs at the Penn.  But OMG when am I going to wake up from this nightmare?????  Do you all agree I'm doing the right thing with all this testing since the treatments will be totally different and if the cancer has spread, it's one teeny tiny spot right now. Thank goodness for Xanax lol..................",

I had my first rads treatments today.  Not bad - this on took a little longer than what will be the norm but I was still pretty much in and out.  I did ask my radiologist what my stage was and he told me 3 b/c not sure why they graded it like that and not sure if it makes a difference.  He did tell me that all my doctors are still planning on and hoping for a cure.  I keep telling myself they wouldn't tell me that if it wasn't true - right??? He also told me to stop looking at stats on the Internet lol.  U just need to know there are many 3c long termers out there? Hugs to all..........................",

So if the N3 is lymph nodes, do I have three postive or 19?  OMG I am so confused which isn't helping my state of mind.  I love my docs but trust you and your opinions more than theirs. Hugs to all.

My counts are supposed to be getting lower not higher. I haven't told anyone yet because I can't say the words. How do you tell people you love that you are dying? I'm still working because I have to do something to feel normal and other than the side effects from the Arimidex, I feel great physically - mentally not so much. I do have a script for Effexor and Xanax. My family is making plans to go to Las Vegas for Christmas and Europe next summer. Right now I feel like I should be getting my affairs in order not planning vacations. Maybe Christmas will be okay but with numbers like I have next summer is doubtful. I know I should be happy for the time I've had - I'm 58 and there are women a lot younger than I am that have this disease and I can't imagine what it's like to be a child suffering with cancer.  But I want to be selfish.  My kids are older and have graduated college but I want more time.  I want to see my grandkids grow up but my kids need spouses first lol.  Sorry to rant but How do I deal with this????   Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Sep 11, 2012 10:17AM - edited Sep 11, 2012 10:18AM by michele54 Thank you everyone.  I am so anti antidepressants but know I have to take them. I am feeling a little better - Friday I was having a lot of bone and joint pain from the Arimidex and the Motrin the doctors prescribed was doing nothing so I took one of the Percocets I have been hording from when I had my ovaries out and went to bed  I felt so much better in the morning - felt 60 instead of 100 and that is doing a lot for my mood.  I have 4 left and just asked my onc for a new prescription for them - hoping she says okay. I so look forward to having years of freaking out and know I have to get past the new reality stage of this.  I'm glad it's a normal thing not to tell anyone - my doctors say I should because this is a lot to carry by myself but I would rather do that - I can deal with my moods as they hit and not be looked at like \"is there something wrong with mom?\"  I have to keep things normal for them and in that way I feel normal - well our normal.    I am still having issues knowing that the rest of my life is going to revolve around tests, scans, doctors, chemo (I don't want to do more chemo), and more tests and scans.  How do you learn to live with that?  One a month doctor appointments?? UGH have I told you I hate doctors? HMMMMMM Jennifer - two at a time?  Didn't know you could do that.  I've only been on Arimidex for a little over six weeks and I know it needs time to work.  I do LOVE LOVE LOVE the idea of the 5 year CD......   It looks like I'm ranting again......... Need to get this under control.  Guess I have to give in to the happy pills.  Love you all and thanks. ",
