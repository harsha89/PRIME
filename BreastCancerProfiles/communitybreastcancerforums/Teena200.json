They took about 4 samples and let me see them. I think the waiting is pure torture. Greengirl I hope for good results soon for you too. As for the biopsy itself, I didn't find it to be painful. They numbed me very well and I didn't even take a Tylenol after. Ice the area as instructed and it shouldn't be too bad. Of course that was my own experience. We are all different. I hope that helps any concerns about the procedure itself. Hoping for good news. Thanks for letting me know I'm not alone ðŸ˜”",

I've heard it can take 4 business days which would put me into Monday before I know anything. I feel like my entire life is on hold. Can't make any plans. My husband and I were talking about looking at properties to buy and were going to spend the weekend doing that. I can't get excited about life now. I am newly married. I lost my first husband of 28 years to cancer. And a year before his diagnosis my best friend. And after her aneighbor to breast cancer. All of this in the last 4 years. One after another. So I'm extremely scared. Not sure how to cope... Log in to post a reply",

But I will still need surgery right away they said because there is a possibility of these turning cancerous down the road? I don't know about anyone else's experience with this type of tumor but I'llwelcome any info. I haven't read any reports. I'm just going to wait for the doctor to call me back on Tuesday to schedule the meeting with the breast surgeon. I was told not to google but of course I did. And I read that even though the biopsy was benign there can be cancer found in the duct itself once removed. Oh why did I google...anyway I hope that depends on many variables and what the report actually read. In the mean time I'm going to take these b9 ran results and enjoy my weekend and hope the same for you!",
