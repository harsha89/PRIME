The numbness of the area is going away as nerves regenerate.  I still have tenderness,  swelling and tightness on awakening every day.  I still have to massage the area and do a minimum of about 20 mins of arm exercises to feel \"normal\".  Its just a \"new normal\".  I also found skin brushing to be helpful to get the lymph moving away from the area (only after months of recovery). They tell me that life is more normal after a year- so it will keep changing.  Don't give up hope- just take life day by day.",
