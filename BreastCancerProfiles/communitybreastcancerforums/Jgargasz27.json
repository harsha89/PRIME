In Dec. they found DCIS stage 0 in my right breast. The surgeon thinks I should lean towards a mastectomy. The oncologists was thinking lumpectomy with radiation. I can also choose bilateral mastectomy with or without reconstruction. I am overwhelmed! The first time I had bc it seemed a lot simpler...I didn't have as many choices. Now I am terrified of making the correct one. I would love some feedback! Thank you! Log in to post a reply",
