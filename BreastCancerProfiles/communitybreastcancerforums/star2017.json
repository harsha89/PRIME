It makes me feel the prognosis is better, knowing that this is something doctors deal with and treat. I was shocked too when I read the size of my tumor. It actually took me months to process. It was not something I really understood when I first got the pathology report, and I was so busy with chemo and life that I just didn't dwell on it. Now I've had a chance to go back over and try to understand my reports, and it is bizarre to think something so large was growing inside me. We're throwing everything at this cancer. I hope it means I'll be around for a while, to share in my children's lives. ",

I also had an echo before starting AC, as well as a CT scan and bone scan. I did dose dense AC (4 infusions). My main side effect from AC was the fatigue. I was extra sleepy for the 7-10 days after the infusion, but I was still functional. A couple times I got slightly nauseous and took Zofran to keep it from getting worse, but it was very minimal, and I would likely have been fine without any meds. My premeds before AC included antinausea meds and dexamethasone. I also had dexamethasone pills for the first few days after the infusion to help with energy and nausea. I also had a Neulasta on pro device. After my second infusion I developed a fever right around the time my white blood cell counts hit a low and I was hospitalized. The fever turned out to be due to a minor virus, and my WBC jumped up quickly in response to the Neulasta, so I was kept in the hospital \"just in case\" only. Wishing you all the best. Star",

There are some tough times ahead. Try your best to focus on one step at a time. I did have times I wanted to talk about unpleasant things, about imagining my husband's future and my children's without me. If your wife wants to do the same try your best to listen, eventho it's hard and it's unlikely you'll really be in that scenario. I needed to be able to share my fears. It helped to be reassured,but it was also important to be heard.  Wishing you and your wife all the best.",

I'm sorry that you also had to deal with breast cancer. I hope you have been well since. JRT: one tumor site was Her2 negative and the other was inconclusive. I'm not sure if they've gotten the results from further testing of that. Have you gone to see multiple doctors? I live near lots of university hospitals and went to two to address my case. Initially one of the oncologists recommended chemo first, but after he met with his breast cancer team, he changed his mind and now both sets of doctors I saw are recommending the same protocol. In some ways, I'm glad I don't have to make that difficult decision. One of the reasons they don't want to do chemo first anymore is that they prefer to do two cycles and then wait 3-4 weeks before delivery, and that is just cutting it close for me. You may be just early enough that the other recommendation makes more sense.",

      "Content": "Nov 17, 2018 12:29PM star2017 wrote: Hi there, So sorry to hear about your girlfriend's diagnosis. I was diagnosed last year at age 37 with a large tumor too, though it was invasive ductal carcinoma and DCIS, so slightly different diagnosis. The treatment plan for me was 4 infusions of AC and then 4 infusions of Taxol. Is that how hers is? Please don't hesitate to ask questions. If I can help, I will. I also did radiation and had mastectomies. You can see the details of my process below. It's going to be a long year, and it's best to focus on one step at a time. Each step is manageable, but it feels overwhelming when you think of the whole process. Chemo wasn't too bad. I recently wrote out my experience in another thread. I'll copy that here, as I hope it will be helpful for your girlfriend: With AC, my main symptom was fatigue. I was very rarely nauseous. The doctors gave me anti-nausea meds in my infusion and also some steroids for the few days after which made me feel pretty good. If I felt even the slightest bit of nausea, I took Zofran, but I think that was only twice or three times during the whole time I was on AC. I was also given Neulasta to help keep my white blood cell counts up. I was pretty tired during the AC treatments, and napped whenever I could, but I was able to be up and about too. The first week is tough, and then you start to feel normal. Then it's time for the next infusion. My hair started shedding about two weeks in, and fell dramatically three weeks after my first chemo. When it first started to shed, I had my husband give me a buzz cut. That's when I started wearing the chemo beanies (I had a cute wig, but didn't wear it that often). After my second AC infusion, I developed a fever. It was cold and flu season. My kids were sick, and I caught something from them. But bloodwork revealed my white blood cell count was also very low at the same time, so as a precaution, the doctors checked me in to the hospital. I had to have lots of tests, and was hospitalized for four days. It probably would have been more, but I was feeling better and all the tests were clear, and the doctor was sympathetic to the fact that I had a newborn plus two other kids at home, so I was out after four days. Thankfully, that was the only time my white blood cell count dropped like that and the only time I got sick and needed to be hospitalized. Due to the hospitalization, I had to delay my infusion. Then a couple weeks later, I developed a mild case of shingles, and so we delayed it again, to make sure I was strong enough for infusion #3. The four rounds of Taxol were easier in some ways and harder in others. Taxol usually doesn't affect your immune system the way AC does. I did not have quite as much fatigue, but I was very achy in the 2-4 days after Taxol infusions. I learned to take pain meds (Aleve, Advil, or Tylenol) regularly those first few days, until the aches wore off. Though I lost my hair in the first 2-3 weeks of chemo, I lost my eyebrows and eyelashes about 2 months in. That was a bit of a shock because suddenly I felt like I looked sick in a way I did not feel with just the hair loss. I started chemo November 2017 and completed it March 2018. I've got my brows and lashes. My hair is a little longer than pixie length, pretty wavy/curly. ",

There are a lot of doctors appointments throughout this process, so it definitely helps to have grandparents, a partner with a flexible schedule, and other babysitting help around, so you don't have to worry about scheduling too much. I was also hospitalized due to a fever (ended up not being serious, but it took almost four days to confirm that). Again, go where there's a great support network, easiest access to good doctors you like, etc. Also, I do agree that you can wait to make a final decision until there's a clear treatment plan. Best wishes to you. Please let me know if you have any questions.  ",

The doctors gave me anti-nausea meds in my infusion and also some steroids for the few days after which made me feel pretty good. If I felt even the slightest bit of nausea, I took Zofran, but I think that was only twice or three times during the whole time I was on AC. I was also given Neulasta to help keep my white blood cell counts up. I was pretty tired during the AC treatments, and napped whenever I could, but I was able to be up and about too. The first week is tough, and then you start to feel normal. Then it's time for the next infusion. My hair started shedding about two weeks in, and fell dramatically three weeks after my first chemo. When it first started to shed, I had my husband give me a buzz cut. That's when I started wearing the chemo beanies (I had a cute wig, but didn't wear it that often). After my second AC infusion, I developed a fever. It was cold and flu season. My kids were sick, and I caught something from them. But bloodwork revealed my white blood cell count was also very low at the same time, so as a precaution, the doctors checked me in to the hospital. I had to have lots of tests, and was hospitalized for four days. It probably would have been more, but I was feeling better and all the tests were clear, and the doctor was sympathetic to the fact that I had a newborn plus two other kids at home, so I was out after four days. Thankfully, that was the only time my white blood cell count dropped like that and the only time I got sick and needed to be hospitalized. Due to the hospitalization, I had to delay my infusion. Then a couple weeks later, I developed a mild case of shingles, and so we delayed it again, to make sure I was strong enough for infusion #3. Though I lost my hair in the first 2-3 weeks of chemo, I lost my eyebrows and eyelashes about 2 months in (at the beginning of Taxol phase but I\u2019ve read the timing is more to do with hair cycles, not with the Taxol). That was a bit of a shock because suddenly I felt like I looked sick in a way I did not feel with just the hair loss. I started chemo November 2017 and completed it March 2018. I've got my brows and lashes. My hair is about pixie length.",

      "Content": "Mar 22, 2019 09:50PM - edited Mar 24, 2019 07:35PM by star2017 Hello all, Yesterday was one year PFC! My hair is super curly, but looks cute and deliberate now. I've cut it three times, I think, so that it has a bit of a shape and doesn't look like a mullet! I've got my lashes and brows back. I've found my skin is more sensitive since chemo. When it's dry, there's a biting sort of tingle, so I have to keep it constantly moisturized. It gets irritated more easily -- like where my bra clasp is is constantly itching. Occasionally I notice some tingles in my fingers that are probably some form of neuropathy, but overall, my side effects have been minimal. I rejoined the gym and go pretty regularly, tho I am not doing anything intense. Only light cardio, yoga, basic strength training, and not for very long at any given time. But it's helping me build back stamina and strength. I could stand to lose some weight, but I'm focusing on being healthy and strong. I had my exchange surgery, a prophylactic mx, and prophylactic removal of ovaries and tubes. Menopause symptoms are not terrible, but they are there. Minor hot flashes and fatigue, some dryness. I've been on Tamoxifen for ten months now, and it's gone fine, though I'll probably be switching to an AI soon. Reconstruction is not fully complete -- still need to reconstruct the nipple. My two breasts are not totally even, but I'm not sure fatgrafting is worth it. I think I'll do the nipple recon and see if I feel better about uneveness. I think fatgrafting can't completely fix the issue, as the cancer side has been radiated and the implant just doesn't \"sit\" the same way. The PS said the way the MX is done can also cause some differences. Anyway, it's not obvious to anyone but me that one side has a little more cleavage than the other, and likely I won't do anything beyond the nipple recon.  I am beginning to settle into and accept my new normal. I hope things are going well for all of you. ",

I thought I was beginning to see hair growth, but I think it's only stuff that never fell. Hard to tell. I am just over two weeks PFC. I met with my MO yesterday and I'll be starting tamoxifen in about 6 weeks, about the same time I start radiation. Before then I have surgery (prophylactic mastectomy and reconstruction). I'm very nervous. I need to start preparing for the surgery, now that I know what to expect. I'm planning to get the special bras with drain holders this time. Who knew they existed?!

An update for me since surgery: I had the exchange done on my right side. I got the round gummy bear implant Sientra 440, and while the tissue expander looked like it was about the size of the left breast (that I still had at the time), this just doesn't look right. It's too small or too high or too flat or too something. Maybe it's the lack of a nipple. it's funny because the whole time I was telling my PS to make sure he didn't go too big. I guess part of the problem is my postpartum body. I was diagnosed while pregnant and am only 5 months postpartium and just not happy with the belly pooch. I suppose that's one reason things don't look quite right, the proportions are off. I have a follow up with the PS tomorrow and will definitely ask him, but would love some advice for those who may have experienced something similar. The left prophylactic mastectomy side is doing okay. If you recall, they weren't able to do immediate reconstruction due to poor blood flow, so there's a tissue expander there instead. The area looks less bruised, so i assume that's a good sign. I'm waiting to hear back from the radiation oncologist to determine if I have to wait until after radiation (May-July) before starting fills and doing the exchange. When I left the hospital I was prescribed Vicodin, Valium, an antibiotic, and colace. Yesterday I tried Tylenol rather than Vicodin, and today I dropped the valium and added ibuprofen between Tylenol doses, to see if I can manage that way. It's been okay. In better news, there's definitely hair growth. It's patchy and very fine, but it's there.",

It motivates me to take a little break, even if it's just 20min of exercise.

Apparently the AI are more effective (slightly) than tamoxifen. Plus tamoxifen has that slight increased risk of uterine cancer. The downside with the AI is the increased side effects. Now that I'm in menopause due to the surgeries, it's worth trying the AI. If I don't do well on it, I'll switch back.",

I noticed that on the side of my left foot, at the heel, there was itching/discomfort, which I attributed to Taxol and its neuropathy side effects. The itching has been gone for a while, but now I noticed little bumps under the skin. It looks like the picture in the following link, and if it's that, I guess it's harmless, but I'm wondering if I should schedule a visit to the doctor, just in case: http://www.foot-pain-explained.com/piezogenic_papu... Has anyone else experienced something like this? What are your thoughts? The other thing is the above condition seems to be associated with athletic people, and I'm definitely not athletic, especially not since the cancer diagnosis and treatment in the past 7 months.I do spend time chasing after three kids tho.",

I had my final chemo in March, then a prophylactic MX 4 weeks later, and then radiation 4 weeks after that. I stopped covering my hair about 3 months PFC, in June. Radiation was not fun, but recovery has been okay. In October I had my ovaries removed and completed reconstruction. So I'm 38 and experiencing some minor side effects of menopause -- mostly just occasional hot flashes. I think the moodiness and fatigue could just be life with small children, but I suppose it is compounded by the hormonal changes in my body. I started Tamoxifen in May, and so far there haven't been very obvious side effects (I broke out in hives in the beginning and had some achiness, but that seems to have disappeared). I'm otherwise doing okay, though dealing minor lymphadema and cording (15 months after MX!). PT seems to be helping a lot, thank goodness. Wishing you all the best!",

They were very pleased with the way the left (prophylactic mastectomy) side was healing, especially since there had been concerns about blood flow. I'm supposed to apply Aquaphor regularly to encourage healing. I did talk to my PS about the right (implant, no nipple) not looking quite right, but he also reminded me that there was no reason we couldn't make adjustments in the future. But it's best for me to get past radiation and past the post-partum phase. I think I'll take the next few months to eat healthy and be a bit more active. I think if I lose 10lbs, I'll look much more like myself and more proportionate. Larger boobs always make me look chubby and matronly, and I want to avoid that! When it's time to reconstruct the left, we can think about if the right needs revision. I still have my drain, so I'll need to go back next week, but I'm generally feeling better.
