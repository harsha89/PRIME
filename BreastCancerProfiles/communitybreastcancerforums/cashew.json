I kept a puke bag in close reach, not for the patients but for me. My Manager noticed and promptly went over to the cafeteria and came back with a glass of dill pickle juice. She said to drink a couple tablespoons. Not long later, I noticed the nausea was gone. When it came back that afternoon, I drank a little more and it worked again. Love those simple, non-medication cures.   My hair is nearly gone. Funny thing though, that goofy peach fuzz on my cheeks, like where my son has massive sideburns, is going away VERY slowly. I still have eyelashes and eyebrows. I also have an adorable wig, and several cute hats and a few scarves. What a fun fashion adventure.  I too hate Neulasta side effects. I hate them so much that I called Amgen, the company that makes it and asked about reduced dosages. They are overnighting me some info about that. My WBCs were too low to get my treatment on Day 8, I got neupogen. WBC went from 2.8 to 10.1 in just one day.  So I got my treatment on day 9 (yesterday) and am scheduled to go back for Neulasta today.  Neupogen is the short acting cell stimulator, 24-48 hours. Neulasta is longer acting and can only be given at least 24 hours after to treatment or 14 days prior to the next treatment. Wonder when the white count gets the highest after administration.  Carol ",

So it is generally more effective to treat brain mets with radiation. I will get a total of 14 radiation treatments, already had the first 5, and then go on from there. I just hope that while the chemo cat is away the mets mice don't play too much. God has indeed blessed me so far, why would I expect anything less. I've had breast cancer off and on for 17 years. There's several tumors in my brain, several in my liver, in my spine, and all throughout my lungs and I can still work full time in the ER. I must be the luckiest woman alive. Either that or I'm too stupid to sit still. Love to you all, You are in my prayers, Carol Carol",

I had my 14 whole brain radiation treatments. I got my first Halaven treatment last week then went to the Bahamas. I'm glad I didn't get sick on vacation. My WBC count was 1.89 when I got back. I got neupogen and then got the second shot of this round yestrday. I have to go get that darn Neulasta shot tomorrow. Should have gotten it today but I was working all day. I think I may have posted this before. I spoke with the rep from the company that make Neulasta. She sent me a bunch of info about Neulasta studies. The studies about reducing the dose by 1/2 were not too promising. However one small study in which the patients received 4mg instead of 6mg had very good results. That is what I get, 4mg, and the side effects are much more mild, but the WBCs go way up for me. I may just respond extremely well to those meds. I have never had to have more than 1 Neupogen shot. I have a nice example of what we may see coming out of Japan soon, radiation burns to my head. It hurts to waer my wig. I am using the creams form the radiation doctor and they help. But as one of my co-workiers put it this morning, I went all Muslim on him and wore a beautiful scarf as a turban.  To the new Halavenites, Welcome to the club. May God Bless us all! I sending up a prayer for allof you. Carol",

The CAT scans included my neck and went just high enough to catch a tumor in my brain. MRI showed several more. I had NO symptoms. Thank You God. There may be a few more spots developed in my liver, but the largest tumor in my liver shrank significantly, the ones in my lungs looked better, and the ones in my lower spine were gone. The ones in my neck remain unchanged. So at the moment I'm off the Halaven and taking radiation to my brain. Then my research-doing, speech-giving, texbook-writing oncologist in Indy says he is going to discuss me with some of his colleagues around the nation, discuss it with my local oncologist and me make a plan. Personally, I hope the plan includes continuing the Halven because it was obviously working on some of the cancer. So at the moment I'm not a Halavenite, but I'm hoping to be back. Carol",

So I agree that it is probably the Halaven doing its wonderful business.   Neulasta - I hate it. No chemo has made me feel as bad as the Neulasta does.   Paula, Go to Hawaii! What better place to enjoy some relaxation. Don't let breast cancer define you! I can tell from your energetic, encouraging posts that there's lots more to you than that.  ",

Can't wait to hear what the first set of scans show for all of us. I'll be praying for the whole lot of us. Amgen, the company that makes Neulasta, sent me the results of some studies. I convinced my oncologist to give me 4mg instead of the usual 6mg. And it worked! I respond with gusto to neupogen and Neulasta. One week after the Neulasta my WBC was 23.1, but then I've never had more than one Neupogen shot. That takes my WBCs from 2.8 to 10.3 in one shot, one day. I go for the first day of round 3 tomorrow, so we'll see what my WBCs are then. Decadron???? You don't all get pre-medicated with decadron do you? I really don't want it because it keeps me up all night the first and sometimes the 2nd night. I don't see anything in the prescibing information that suggests pre-medication, although I'm hesitant to give up the Aloxi for nausea. I felt great this week, maybe because of the decrease in Neulasta. I cleaned drawers and closets. I went back to working my whole 12 hour shifts in the ER. Feels great. Hope next week is as good. Keep smiling, God has a plan. Carol",

Taxol was the first chemo I took. When she ran her hand through the leaved of the tree on the ground, I asked my husband if I could just pick up a bunch and eat 'em.  He didn't think that was such a good idea. Carol",
