So training multiple times per week and also weight lifting twice per week. I have not had any compromise in strength (apart from some deconditioning from not exercising properly for the six weeks). My mobility/rangeof motion is also perfect. I developed cording about 3 weeks out from the mastectomy but I got rid of it in one week using yoga and lifting weights. I just want to spread the word about pre-pectoral implants. I couldn't believe I could do my sport without any pain or damage to my chest/reconstruction after only six weeks. I wear a chest guard but that's the only difference. Jiu jitsu comprises judo,wrestling and a lot of being squished under people. Believe me it is tough on the chest. So if it's possible, seek out a plastic surgeon who can do pre-pectoral! 31 year old active keto dieter Dx 2/9/2018, IDC, Right, 6cm+, Stage IIIA, Grade 1, 11/14 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Chemotherapy 4/9/2018 AC + T (Taxol) Surgery 9/13/2018 Lymph node removal: Right; Mastectomy: Left, Right; Prophylactic mastectomy: Left; Reconstruction (left): Silicone implant Log in to post a reply",

Grade 1. I can't find the information I am looking for about it, maybe someone here can help - do the researchers only follow you for two years? Or is the effect of taking the drug for two years supposed to last beyond the two years? If you complete the two years and do not get a recurrence do you keep taking it ad infinitum then? Are we at highest risk in those two years? Also, don't mean to be too nosy but I have just turned 31. Are any of ye this age? I train martial arts, lift weights, swim, do a keto diet. Will the side effects get in the way of any of this stuff do ye think? I will be doing the Pallas trial while also taking tamoxifen and zoladex. Anyone on this combination? Thoughts? Any info would be great, thanks!",
