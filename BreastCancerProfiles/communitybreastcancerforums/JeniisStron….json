I am 31, single, 1 child, and a few years ago I had the scare of my life!! I ended up in the hospital for a month and was diagnosed with behcet's disease. I had to relearn everything from walking, to talking, to bathing myself and feeding myself. I'm still disabled from it. My fine motor skills are off a bit, my speech is difficult.  I have to literally process what I'm going to say or do. I'm in the process of fighting for disability and I promise you that this is NOT where I saw myself at 31!! So what else could go wrong right!??! I was diagnosed with breast cancer!! I received the phone call yesterday while making dinner... and of course who has an appetite after that kind of news!? So I am still in the \"shock\" stage and I don't know where to go or what to do!? I thought that maybe having people to talk to that are and have gone through it would be a good thing!! I'm trying to stay positive about the whole situation! But I have to tell you ALWAYS follow your instincts!! My primary dr found the lump and he said to \"just watch it\", but it was so abnormal for me to have a lump. I have never had a lump in my breast before. So I was paranoid and got a second opinion. He sent me to mammography and they ordered a biopsy right then and there. I'm so glad I went with my instinct to get a second opinion!! I hate to think \"why ME\" but it's hard not to! Especially with what I've already been through! I'm horrible at keeping up with things, just an FYI, but I am going to try to stay here and really get support and knowledge. Anything is a helpful thing at this point!! My next step is an MRI to see if it is localized or if it has spread, and to find out what stage I'm in. They're supposed to call me today to schedule the appt! By the way, I was dx with invasive ductal carcinoma. Good luck to all! Many prayers and thoughts are with you! Hope to make some new friends!!",
