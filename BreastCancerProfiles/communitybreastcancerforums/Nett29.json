I would like to know what stage I am, but he says can only be done after biopsy taken during operation. What about blood tests? And I thought MR can detect stage. Would appreciate advice Tnx Nett29 Log in to post a reply",

He wants to do biopsy first, but that means extra cost and anesthesia twice. I am pretty sure I would rather do BMX. Dont know size. Requested test results, but did not receive it yet and he did not mention size. I see him tomorrow and will then ask. I am very concerned about metastatis. But he says it involves a lot of tests and also lymph nodes biopsy.Â ",
