      "Content": "KristaM wrote: My Mother was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer. They told her that her chances of living for five more years were very low considering how aggressive that it was. I'm exact as to the size of her tumor or all the details about it (I was 14 when she was diagnosed and she tried to hide what she was going through so I didn't worry about her). She had it removed from her breast and under went radiation and chemotherapy. I don't know all the names of everything and all the technial stuff about how all of this works but I do know that there are different types of chemo, some are stronger than others (If I've understood correctly?) and from what I know she was given the three most toxic, aggressive, and strong chemo's. They told her that she was \"maxed\" out on the amount of chemo and radiation she would recieve in her lifetime. I didn't know that this was possible. It has been five years since her initial diagnoses. She has not been declared to be in remission yet. They told her that once she has been cancer free for 7 years they would say that she is in the \"safe zone\" and in remission. (Doesn't seem like there is ever a safe zone for these kinds of things to me though). However, every three months since her initial diagnosis she has had to go for a mammogram. And I'm not sure what all medicine she has had to take but I know that she has like 3 pills a day she has always had to take (one of the medications had to be changed because I guess you can only take it for so long before your body becomes used to it and you have to switch to a different form of it?) BUT this past Thursday she went for her regular mammogram appointment and from what she told me, \"they seen a spot and I have to get an MRI\". I've done so much research and from what I've read it seems pretty rare to go from mammogram to MRI. It seems that typically after the mammogram they can give you an idea of what they believe it could be and also usually an ultrasound or biopsy comes next, not an MRI. I've done so much research and I'm not finding anything out. My mom is still trying to be protective by not making me worry so I know that she'll keep the details of what she knows (i.e. if the cancer is back how bad it is, what they can/cant do) and I'm NOT 14 this time. I am old enough to be there in ways I wasn't able to before and to help her in ways I couldn't before so I need to learn as much about all this as possible. I need knowledge and some understanding so I can be there for her as much as I possibly can be. Have any of you had this kind of experience? (No cancer for 5 years- regular mammograph visit- spot seen- MRI?) Does anyone know any information on the likelihood of it being something benign, or a cyst, or a mistake during the mammogram? I couldn't find any information online about getting cysts or benign tumors after having cancer five years before? Or having cancer before period. I could only find info about cysts and bengn tumors BEFORE ever having cancer and it increasing the risk of developing cancer. Also, with triple negative being such an aggressive cancer and them basically telling her that her chances of living more than 5 years were slim to none when she was first diagnosed and it being her 5th year what are the chances of it not being cancer? ANY information anyone has will be so helpful. I don't want to swarm her with questions and stress her out by doing so right now because I know she is worried enough but I don't know what else to do or how else to find out information about any of this and I am so so worried and stressed out.

I will most definitely have to ask if I can just read the letter and reports. I have tried to attend doctors appointments with her just to be there for support but she doesn't like letting us know when they are. I think she's just so accustomed to handling everything on her own and not needing anyone. Don't know whether to push harder or just let her know I am here if she needs me.",
