I'll be on Tamoxifen for five years after my last treatment, March 23rd. My wife and I are going to ask about it tomorrow again. Keep us posted on your further discussions.",

Stage 2, grade 3, 4 cm tumor. Mastectomy followed. I had the oncotype test which revealed a score of 21. I opted for chemo, TC x 4. My first chemo was last Friday. I am no picture of health so this chemo hit hard. So many bone aches and pains. I am taking Claritin and Glutamine. Are the chemo cycles cumulative or will the side effects be more of the same with the next 3 cycles? Any help is appreciated.",

I have been off work since November. I am a teacher and am glad I decided to recover at home. This year has been awful for the flu. Does anyone else just feel awful for about a week after TC? I am so fatigued it isn't even funny. But somedays I just want to jump out of my skin. Do you all take anything for the bone pain? Thanks and thinking of all.",
