During the ultrasound the lady started taking measuremnts of several dark spots within the outer quad. It did hurt while she was scanning. It took 3 days for the results. The doc that called me said I had dense tissue and Ihad several options. 1. Was to wait for 6 months to have another ultrasound to see if it grows or 2. Was to b set up with a surgical specialist.. So now Iam thinking they don't know what they are talking about, Iam worried and don't know where to go. The more stuff I read, the more I get worried. Log in to post a reply",
