She also gave me some stretching exercises to help keep the skin loose.  The swelling was caused by the tighteness of skin.  It was making it more difficult for the lymphatic fluid to flow so it was backing up a little.  I would recommend you see your onc for a recommendation to a certified lymphedema therapist.  I don't know if a physical therapist would be able to help--maybe if they knew how to work with breast cancer problems",
