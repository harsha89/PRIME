So we just spoke again with the surgeon, because a mastectomy is scheduled for next week. The Dr said that there is a risk, increased by my mothers age, that the sentinal nodes will not \"light up\" from the dye. She said the gold-standard procedure for a young otherwise healthy person, would be to then take all of the axillary nodes. However, for an elderly person who has mobility person, she would not risk lymphedema. The complicating factor is that my mother is very mobile and in somewhat good health, but just learned she has severe osteoporosis. So my mom is somewhere in the middle of healthy/not healthy. We cannot decide whether to be aggressive with the axillary nodes or not, in the case that a sentinal node cannot be identified. The Dr suggested we do a MODIFIED version, where she takes many nodes, but leaves the ones under her arms. Any thoughts? Thank you! Log in to post a reply",

Our surgeon is at another hospital. We tried Anne Moore at Weill but she is only seeing survivors currently. I was going to call James Speyer at NYU, but I dont think he specializes in breast cancer, so we were unsure. Any leads? Anyone use Eleni Andrepoulou at Weill? Thank you! Log in to post a reply",

Everything I read says she can wear a special bra that zips up the front Is there a chance we misunderstood? Anyone else told to wear a big wrapped ace bandage until post-op appt? Remarkeable, she had little pain but the bandage is irritating her. Log in to post a reply",
