I had an ultrasound and the Dr said it was nothing to be concerned with. Well FF to this month, the first lump is now much bigger. Thick, about an inch long deep inside my breast. I just thought I would check out my armpit and found even more lumps, some small and some larger. Round and hard. They do not move very well, but if I try and can budge them. So questions: Has anyone one ever had this? Did they hurt? I have another ultrasound tomorrow at 1:30pm~ I am doing all I can to keep it together and not let my mind play tricks on me. Thanks Log in to post a reply",
