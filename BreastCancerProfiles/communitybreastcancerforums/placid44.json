The drugs they gave me before, during, and after prevented that. My oncologist was able to manage what did come up - low blood pressure, very low white blood counts (even w/ neulasta, so took iv and oral antibiotics), an infection, strong fatigue. I was able to work a few hours a week, from home. That said, I would do it again in a second because it was a critical part of my treatment. I am triple negative. Best wishes to you. It was doable. Try to line up some help/support for groceries, laundry, and trips to chemo (depending on your family situation), and take one day at a time. Take the miralax and other drugs on schedule...they really help. It went faster than I thought. You will be busy.",

I saw breast surgeon today and she said the\"growth\" of the mass is highly likely to be inflammation/dead cells from the chemo killing the tumor. Your body absorbs the dead cells over time, but it can only (forgive me) \"eat\" so much so fast. She did ultrasound and it is only slightly smaller than before chemo started, but again, much of it could be dead cells. The ultrasound doesn't measure/can't tell how much of it is dead cells. She said the swelling under my arm is probably an infected hair and/or my lymph nodes reacting to the fact that I started chemo only four days after sentinel node biopsy. The snb incision did not have time to heal and the lymph nodes are feeling that. I did not have axillary dissection because only one sentinel node was positive, three other sentinel nodes negative. They just removed the four sentinel nodes. I just had third ac yesterday, final ac in two weeks, then twelve weeks taxol, weekly. They'll do MRI after six weeks of taxol.

Trust your intuition and follow up on this promptly. Have your PCP write you an order for a diagnostic mammogram, even if she does not suspect cancer. 2. If it helps you/doesn't make you anxious, start researching (online and talking with friends) about the good oncologists and breast surgeons in your area, just in case the tests are positive. I did that in the couple of weeks it took to get in for the mammogram. When I was diagnosed, the research I had done helped me start treatment more quickly. That was important in my case since I had an aggressive tumor. 3. If it turns out to be positive, know that the diagnosis and the pathology report (and waiting for them first) are the hardest part. I started to feel better once I had my doctors in place, knew what kind of breast cancer I had (frommthe pathology report), and knew what my treatment plan was going to be. That is common. We know our own bodies. I found my lump and knew immediately that something was wrong...I have never had lumpy breasts. I hope yours turns out to be benign, which is true in something like 80 percent of biopsies. Just make sure things move along. Best of luck with everything and I hope to hear how you make out.",

      "Content": "placid44 wrote: www.news-medical.net/news/2013... Aggressive breast cancer\u2019s metastasis molecular switch identified Published on January 15, 2013 at 11:54 AM Scientists at Weill Cornell Medical College have discovered the molecular switch that allows aggressive triple negative breast cancer cells to grow the amoeba-like protrusions they need to crawl away from a primary tumor and metastasize throughout the body. Their findings, published in Cancer Cell, suggest a novel approach for developing agents to treat cancer once it has spread. \"Metastasis can be lethal, and our findings point to potential targeted treatments to stop the spread of this aggressive breast cancer,\" says the study's senior investigator, Dr. Vivek Mittal, an associate professor of cell and developmental biology and director of the Lehman Brothers Lung Cancer Laboratory at Weill Cornell Medical College. According to researchers, if such agents were developed, they would perhaps be the first to specifically treat cancer metastasis, importantly in patients whose tumors have already spread. They would also be among the first designed to restore the function of a microRNA (miRNA), a small, non-coding RNA that regulates gene expression, which is crucial to cancer spread. While distinct miRNA \"signatures\" have been found for many tumor types, including different breast cancers, their specific roles in later steps of cancer metastasis has been unclear, Dr. Mittal says. In the study, researchers set out to identify a miRNA that impacts metastasis without affecting primary tumor growth, as well as address its underlying molecular mechanisms and therapeutic potential against metastatic breast cancer. They discovered that a miRNA known as miR-708 is inhibited in metastatic triple negative breast cancer. They found that miR-708 acts as a metastatic tumor inhibitor, and when its function is restored, the tumors do not spread or form lethal macrometastases. Silenced miRNA Inhibitor Molecule Can Be Switched Back On Triple negative breast cancer has the worst outcome of all breast cancer subtypes because of its high recurrence rate and metastatic spread. This is why the research team chose to examine the role of miRNAs in the spread of triple negative breast cancer, which accounts for 15-25 percent of all breast tumors. The cancer is named \"triple negative\" because its tumor cells do not display two hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone) or HER2/neu growth factor, which each form the basis of current targeted breast cancer treatments. Using genome wide miRNA sequencing, Dr. Mittal and his research team found in human samples of triple negative breast cancer that miR-708 was significantly down-regulated with its normal expression curtailed. In both laboratory cells and in animal studies, the researchers identified that the normal role of miR-708 is to suppress the protein neuronatin, which is located on the membrane of a cell's endoplasmic reticulum -- an organelle that stores calcium. Neuronatin helps control how much calcium leaves that organelle. \"It is calcium that provides legs to cancer cells to help them escape a tumor. So miR-708 acts as a suppressor of metastasis by keeping neuronatin in check,\" Dr. Mittal says. \"If miR-708 is itself suppressed, there is an increase in production of neuronatin proteins, which then allows more calcium to leave the endoplasmic reticulum and activate a cascade of genes that turn on migratory pathways leading to metastasis.\" Researchers found that delivering synthetic miR-708, carried by bubbles of fat, blocked metastatic outgrowth of triple negative breast cancer cells in the lung of mice. This makes miR-708 a promising therapeutic against metastatic breast cancer. The researchers also discovered that polycomb repressor complex proteins are responsible for silencing miR-708. These proteins remodel the way DNA is packaged in order to epigenetically silence genes. Dr. Mittal adds that the findings suggest that pharmacological agents now being tested in lymphoma cancer cells may also help to restore miR-708 in triple negative breast cancer. These drugs are designed to inhibit histone-lysine N-methyltransferase EZH2, the member of the polycomb group that directly silences miR-708. \"It is exciting that there are now drugs that can turn off the silencing of these critical genes. They could very well work for this aggressive breast cancer,\" says Dr. Mittal. \"Finding that there may be a way to shut down the spread of an aggressive breast cancer -- which is the only way that triple negative breast cancer can be controlled and lives spared -- is very promising.\" These study results are terrific,\" says co-author Dr. Linda Vahdat, director of the Breast Cancer Research Program, chief of the Solid Tumor Service and professor of medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College and medical oncologist at the Iris Cantor Women's Health Center at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center. \"It not only offers us an avenue to treat metastatic triple negative breast cancer in the short-term, but also gives us the roadmap to prevent metastases in the long-run. We are anxious to get this into the clinic and are working as quickly as possible towards that end.\" The study was funded by the Neuberger Berman Lung Cancer Laboratory, the Robert I. Goldman Foundation and the Cornell Center on the Microenvironment and Metastasis through an award from the National Cancer Institute.

Your invasive portion is small -- that's good. Ki67 is the proliferation rate, or growth rate, for the invasive portion. Yours is high. That's generally not good because it indicates an aggressive tumor, but again, yours is small and less likely to have spread (although that does happen sometimes...it's rare). Also, chemo generally is more effective on high grade/high proliferation tumors because chemo targets fast dividing cells. You are highly ER positive - that's good because it means hormone drugs will be more effective. Your sentinel node biopsy will tell you more about whether there is any cancer in your lymph nodes, which helps determine the stage.

The chemo is intended to start getting at those asap. At the same time, it's working on the tumor itself. It's not just about shrinking it to make surgery easier/better, it's about making it less lethal. If the chemo doesn't start to work quickly (ie, if the tumor does not respond/shrink), then they will switch chemos",
