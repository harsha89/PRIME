It goes to show that these scans cannot pick up everything.  I talked with the Oncologist yesterday. Told her I would not take Tamoxifen and was thinking of removing my breasts. She said she understands as a woman and is now sending me to the genetic team for some testing. ",

Great grandmother one side died of ovarian cancer and the other side died of colon cancer. Lots of melanoma. One aunt died from it. My mom has calcifications, but nothing else. Not sure why the Oncologist wants me to meet with the genetic counselor. I'll do it though, if they think it will give me some sort of peace of mind!?",

On my 40th birthday I was told no cancer, but ADH with and my path report was very busy. Now they want to put me on anti cancer meds (blocking estrogen) for five years. I meet with the Oncologist on Friday. I can't see myself taking drugs for 5 years. I exercise like a crazy person and eat right. I am thinking I may have a double mastectormy with reconstruction. I would rather do that, than take meds for 5 years. I just want to make the right choice and be around as my 5 year old daughter grows up. Anyone else trying to make a difficult decision like this?",

The PIs on meds are scary, so I try my best to take my vitamin and nothing else. I don't know if I could do 5 years of any type of medicine, espeically one that can be mood altering.  ",

I wouldn't be a good candidate for a reduction either since I'm really an A cup. Although, I wear B bras to make myself feel better. Lol. It is such a scary thing. I just want to get this meeting over with. Why do doctors have to space everything out? I got my diagnosis Nov 28th and I am just now going for my oncologist appointment. Thank you, Traycal",

I told her I was thinking if surgery after she talked about Tamoxifen. She was supportive. She is now sending me to genetics on Jan 4th. No real family breast cancer history, so I don't see genectic testing showing very much.",

I worry that people will ask why, since there is no cancer. I can't see myself taking cancer meds for 5 years and holding my breath with every mamo. I worry way to much. I have had lots of sleepless nights thinking about what I will do. I meet with the oncologist on Friday to hear what she has to say. Thank you again for your post. You have know idea how much it means to me right now. ",
