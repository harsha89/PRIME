They did grow back fairly quickly once they started though. I also had very long lashes before all this. Mine seem to be coming back now better than the first time. So just hang in there! Chelev - I have gotten the Mia Farrow reference a couple of times as well! Goldie - I did end up doing a relaxer on my curls. I went to the hairdresser Friday night and he convinced me. I was worried that it would cause my fine hair too much damage. However, he suggested what he called a \"reverse perm\". He said it is lighter than a actual relaxer. He said they use to do them alot when perms were a big thing. If the perm was too tight they would put this paste on the hair. So, it really did relax these tight pin curls I had. It is still wavy and curly in parts but the front will lay down now and it is easier to get it straighted. My hair is just growing so slowly. It is mostly 2 in but 3 in in some places. My bangs are growing sooo slow. I am still wearing this darn wig to work. I have been out and about now in the evenings and on the weekends but I just hate how I look. It will be coming off soon. Take care all!",

RevitaLashTM was developed by Dr. Michael Brinkenhoff as a special gift for his wife, Gayle, while she was recovering from breast cancer. Intensive chemotherapy treatments had damaged Gayle's once-beautiful eyelashes, leaving them sparse, breakable and fragile. After extensive research with a team of talented cosmetic chemists, Dr. Brinkenhoff formulated an eyelash conditioner that, after just a few weeks, gave a renewed look of vitality to Gayle's eyelashes. Soon friends and family wanted to know Gayle's secret to beautiful looking eyelashes. Gayle knew immediately the perfect name for the amazing eyelash conditioner that had given her eyelashes a renewed look of vitality: RevitaLashTM. Thus, a new product was born; and a formula created originally for just one special woman has become a product available to women everywhere who want to have beautiful looking eyelashes. Gayle and Michael are committed to donating a portion of the proceeds from RevitaLashTM sales to benefit non-profit breast cancer research and education initiatives. \"Often we feel helpless when someone we love is suffering. I am very fortunate, in my own small way, to have been able to help Gayle through her recovery. Watching her be excited about her beautiful looking eyelashes has been a real joy.\" - Michael Brinkenhoff, M.D. Home|Revitalash Seal|The Story|About Us|Questions?|Testimonials|Customer Care|Sales Opportunities|Contact Us|Sitemap Copyright © 2008 Athena Cosmetics Corp.

Thanks Wish and Springtime for the responses.  The anticipation of all this has me going in circles.  Waiting on the bi-lateral was hard, waiting on chemo and waiting on the hair.  UGH!  Now I am more concerned with my hair than my foobs.  I have only gotten expanded twice since my surgery on Sept 16th.  Many are done by now.  But I figure I can't have the surgery until Chemo is done so why rush the process. I have prepared for the hair loss... I think.  I have FOUR wigs ready.  My hairdresser bought me a human hair wig that looks pretty darn good.  I just don't want to be bald underneath.  Then I went and bought 3 since insurance paid for them and they are pretty good too.  One crazy one but the others look like my hair for the most part (although better I think - BUT I want my own hair).  I did buy one sleep cap but wasn't too sure what I would like. I am not married but have a serious boyfriend.  I stay with him almost every night.  He is so supportive and trys to tell me the baldness won't bother him.  What man wants to sleep with someone who is bald and boobless.  I know it will all pass and things will return to some sort of normal.  I keep telling myself the final version of my boobs will probably look better than the originals and my hair will grow back. Ok, thanks for letting me rant.  I hope everyone's hair grows back beautiful!",

I am a financial analyst and am at a desk all day which is more do-able than other jobs I'm sure.  It will all depend on the schedule.  I had chemo once a week for 12 weeks and mine took about 1/2 away from work.  Many chemos would require a whole day but some regimines would give you chemo once every three weeks so you could just take a day every 3 weeks.  However, there are ALOT of doctor appts between surgeon, oncologist, chemo, reconstruction, etc.  That would be tough to manage with a new job.  Thankfully my employer at the time was great and flexible and I worked from home in the evenings if I missed alot of work because of appts.  I think you need alot more information before you can really make the decision.  Find out what treatment they are suggesting.  Hang in there",

Anyway, so, my personal reasoning for the bi-lateral mastectomy is (1) family history (2) don't want to worry about the other breast and not getting detected early enough (like I said... I am a total worrier) (3) I would kick myself if I did get it in the other breast and hadn't taken care of it when I got my \"warning\" (4) I am 37 and still hoping to get married and have a baby and need this behind me and not rearing its ugly head again (5) my PS said I would get a better \"match\" doing both (this didn't really play into it but it was another pro on my list) (6) I have to do the left one since I am not a candidate for a lumpectomy Sorry to rant on and on but I hope it helps in some way.  I don't know if it is the \"right\" decision and I am scared to death but at the same time I feel like it is the \"wise\" decision for me.

On your insurance... do you have an out of pocket maximum?  I started getting really freaked out about the costs; however, someone pointed out that my out of pocket max is $3,500.",

I am triple positive.  I had extensive DCIS, bi-lateral mastectomy and then they found a small tumor which was .4cm.  My lymph nodes were clear. Because of my age (37), HER+ I am doing chemo + Herceptin.  I am wondering once that is done how does the followup work on making sure it doesn't come back.  After my surgery I was told 90% chance it was gone however 10% chance it could have gone somewhere via the bloodstream.  The Taxol+Herceptin gets this down to 5%-6% I believe. I asked my Onc and he said I would come in for a checkup every 6 months which would include blood work. I am curious what others in the same situation have been told.  Since they don't know if anything traveled in my bloodsteam (lymph nodes clear) and the chemo is a \"just in case that happened\" how would it be found?

Thought I would check to see if others have heard of this.
