But I do know that there are many options for success with a different plan of attack and only yesterday was told of 2 cases where they had a last minute turn around after being seriously ill, there is always hope. Now is the time to visit family or friends to get your mind of things or go to see a good movie and distract your thoughts. I hope you get some very good results soon, hang I there.",

He is the most wonderful son and we love one another very much. I am divorced and live with my so and a housemate. Was diagnosed with early bc in April 2006 with 17 of 25 nodes positive. Did chemo and rads and supposed to be on AI's for 5 years but could not take the side effects and gave up. July 2012 had been suffering with sore back and very painful rib, also noticed I had a crackle in my breathing at night. Went on for a few months with gp thinking it was after effects of virus going around. Got to the stage where I was becoming incontinent but with no bladder infection( turned out it was caused by the calcium leaching out of my bones into bloodstream). Finally I said I think I have lung cancer and gp sent me off for x rays. To cut a long story short I was diagnosed with cancer to several areas in spine/ribs and hip. Also plural effusion and medestinal nodes around lungs with cancer. I spent several weeks in hospital and had rads to most important areas, 3 effusions before finally having the talc done to lungs and my breathing has been wonderful since! 6 fillings, 4 extractions and a root canal to prepare for chemo!! Taking femara daily and just started monthly Zometa and scan showed nodes round lung shrinking, yay! And bones shining brightly which is either progression or healing. We are hoping for healing! I was a very sick chick from all the meds and now I have managed to reduce them I have gotten the nausea under control which Makes for a wonderful life, gosh I feel so much happier. I live for the moment and the longer I can stay relatively well and not on chemo the better. I love having contact with all of you lovely ladies, it is very comforting. Love Gail",

Mine was that I would be thinking i needed to go to the toilet and would be wetting my pants before I got there. It got so bad that one time I stood up and had to go to then and there which was dreadful. When I got to hospital they asked about whether I had been incontinent and put me on a saline drip for a few days and it resolved it thankfully. Also I came home on oxycontinen 40 mg morn and night,anti nausea tabs, etc etc and was sooo sick, dry retching all the time and could not eat. I ran out of oxycontinen on the weekend and could not find my script and thought I will have to last till Monday. Well I had the most shocking diareeha, it would not stop and was bright yellow! I was so ill and when I googled info on what was happening it was that I was going through withdrawal from oxycontinen, which can be like going cold turkey from heroin with the side effects. I decided that was it and reduced the oxycontinen to 20 mg morn and night and have had no nausea tabs since. I would say it's like I went through a detox unintentionally. I had my first Zometa a week ago and feeling nauseous sometimes since and not sure if its the drug or the cancer, but will try and find out. Regards,Gail.",

It's amazing how I feel now from last year, I was so ill. I was patted on the leg and told I maybe had 3 years and thought I would die within months as I needed a walking frame just to get around. I had a plural effusion and had it drained 3 times before having the talc treatment, which was very successful. l I had been on femara and had an increase in the spine mets so have now nearly finished 4 months of abraxane chemo as well as Zometa. The last ct scan showed spine mets are receding and bone is regrowing and there is no fluid around lung and nodes appear to be inactive! Wonderful news so far! So now I have hope and just hope it is not a temporary period and I get lots more years.

Sometimes you give and give for little return, but because we get so much out of the friendships formed it s difficult to leave. Losing Angels, people you become close to and then never hear from again and the big personalities that just move one all takes their toll on a forum.

He said in a gruff tone \" well if that's the case I'm sorry\" I told him how rude he was and I did not accept his apology and to leave me alone, but he was a bit drunk and wouldn't. I just kept repeating , go away you rude man and he did. A lady next to me was mortified and had pressed the button for help from staff. When I had to resell the story it opened the flood gates and I could not stop crying. Very embarrassing! The female manager on duty had him evicted from the club which was very nice of her. She said he just didnt get it how rude he had been to me and kept saying \" but I said I was sorry!\" Apparently he had been banned previously for 4 months for upsetting someone , so I'm glad he was sent home, might give him something to think about. I am tired and washed out from it all, which was to have been a switch off for me to relax.",

The last week I have had what feels to be a very sore rib on my right side. I have had ct and MRI a couple of weeks ago to look at spine and am wondering if they check everything or just the spine? I am not sure what could be causing the pain ( I thought my bra but stopped wearing it 5 days go) and if having the scans they would have seen something? I am waiting on a call back from the nurse at palcare whether to increase meds as is bothering me and I have sons 21st tonight. I have also been urinating more than usual but perhaps i have been drinking more. Any thoughts would be appreciated. Bc 2006 17 of 25 nodes ca.

Zometa is given as an infusion,like chemo and xgeva is given as an injection. These are purely to strengthen the bone and can go on for years or months, depends on the patient response. I have stopped after a year as my calcium levels are good now. Aromasin is used to stop the body producing estregen and would have no effect on your mums breathing.The radiation would be to ease the bone spots that are painful. As an area can only be radiated once they will save radiation till it hurts. It can bring wonderful relief as can medication such as oxycontinen or endone. I have been on Abraxane chemotherapy and found it was easy on my body with a good reponse,apart from loosing my hair. I went on another chemo that gave me a heap of issues, and now I start abraxane again next week. Hope this helps you, and your mum finds the right chemo and meds . Love Gai",
