Have any of you taken Valium or something along those lines prior to your infusions?  I've read that it can help your body be more receptive to the meds since you wont be so uptight...?  Has icing the finger/toenails helped?

I've pretty much completely healed from the dbl mastectomy/reconstruction from July, so that's a positive.  I got my head shaved and got fitted for 2 synthetic wigs, which was the last time I think I cried. They're doing the trick, but I have my eyes on a real-hair wig.  I know they're more work, expensive but I figure if I can't have my own hair I want to love the temporary!  Plus, they last much longer. That's the updates from me.  When the SE's are at their worst, I've been able to choke down dry cheerios and about 6 saltines.  Craving plain oatmeal means I'm turning the corner to feeling better.  I sent a note to my Oncologist to see if it's possible to increase the Zof or Comp when nausea it's at it's worst.  I haven't had sleep issues, but I have experienced just not being able to get comfortable in one position for too long.  I would love to sit downstairs and watch a movie, but I can't stay still.  My Oncologist suggested to pop an Antivan next time.  Any other suggestions? For those keeping track of chemo start dates, mine was August 30, 2016. Stay strong ladies.  We are warriors and will get through this! ",
