Her final pathology confirmed the 4 nodes they took during sentinal bipsy were all negative and that there were no other tumors present except for the known 2.8 cm in her left breast. My need to ask for your input is that we are meeting with the oncologist tomorrow. I know every doctor is different and no advice given here is to necessarily replace their opinions nor can anyone offer \"medical advice\", but you amazing women with your experiences light the way with such profound wisdom for the ones to follow, that is what has brought us the most comfort. We feel informed decisions can only come from getting lots of different experiences and opinions, and then you can truly feel what's right in your heart. One of my roles with my mom is to handle the burden of all the overwhelming info, so I hope I'm not offending by posting here even though I'm the daughter. Would you think chances are she will not need chemo at this time? Or should we prepare to expect to hear that's what they want her to do? My concern is I picked up somewhere that once you use a certain chemo cocktail you can't use it again... So if there is no reason to think it has metastisized, wouldn't it be wise to hold off on chemo now in the event there is a recurrence down the road? I want to be prepared to ask the oncologist the right questions, the deeper questions. As you all have felt, this is a completely new world, we are in the dark about so much, and the only way to fight this the best we can, is to research, research, research. If you can shed any light we would be so grateful. All love, mom had BC (the following diagnosis is hers) Dx 10/26/2010, IDC, 2cm, Stage II, Grade 3, 0/4 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I've tried to search for the answer to this in other threads but some are so long to sift through, so I hope you don't mind me making a new question for this. I hope it'll help someone else looking for these answers too.  So I have heard of some girls buzzing their hair before the hair starts to come out on its own, but for the women who left it until it started to fall on its own: did you then buzz it with a 3 guard and wait for the rest of the stubble to fall out into hats on its own? or did you shave it close with a razor and apply lotion? If you shaved it with a razor, did you have any trouble with the remaining hair follicles itching and wanting to come out? In short, we're just wondering what is the least traumatic and most comfortable thing to do with mom's head other than the short cut I already gave her last week. It's starting to come out heavily now, just wanted to ask what you would advise based on what your experience with it was. Thank you so much for taking the time, and for caring like you do <3 ~Nina (and Michele) mom had BC (the following diagnosis is hers) Dx 10/26/2010, IDC, 2cm, Stage II, Grade 3, 0/4 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "ninastar wrote: Hi Ladies! Wasn't sure if I should post this here or the Triple Negative forum, maybe I'll try both. My mom had a double mastectomy end of Nov. We're meeting two oncologists this week about chemo. There was an oncotypeDx ordered, we just haven't been told the results yet. We're a bit confused/overwhelmed with the chemo names/schedule options as they seem to vary a bit. I'm trying to do research to gather questions for the possibilities they'll recommend. She is stage IIb we believe (though they haven't told us as much yet)- she had a 2.9 cm grade 3, triple neg tumor with no nodes. Does this narrow down the options of what they'll recommend or how long they will recommend or does it vary doctor to doctor? It's hard to research all the drugs that are mentioned as I read through all the possiblities, especially if her particular path narrows it down. It seems we're almost always in a state of information overload, so I thought I'd ask for your two cents :-) Thanks for your time and your help, we really appreciate it. <3 ~Nina mom had BC (the following diagnosis is hers) Dx 10/26/2010, IDC, 2cm, Stage II, Grade 3, 0/4 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "ninastar wrote: Hi Ladies, I've been checking these boards out since the end of October when my 63 yo mom was diagnosed, gathering info and insight for her. Turns out through the follow up of an OB I saw today, this lump I've had in my right underarm for 3 years needed another ultrasound. I had an inconclusive one in Feb 09 because they couldn't see it in the imaging, but no one following it since. So I went down after my appt and the radiologist pulled up a 1.5 cm dark irregularly bordered mass that he ruled out was definitely not a cyst or normal breast tissue and recommended me to the surgeons upstairs to have an excisional biopsy this week. Could it be that the universe has such a dark sense of humor that only 3 weeks after my mom's bilateral mastectomy and 7 weeks after her shocking diagnosis, caring for her and seeing her through all of it, every step, that I am now faced with the same scary waiting game? To further complicate things in my head, I am still breastfeeding my baby boy, had no plans of weening him soon either. So I'm on here tonight trying to research how hard that procedure will be under my arm as far as healing time and pain, if anyone is put under with general or if it's always local, and if I will need pain meds beyond the first day of surgery. So I'm looking at if it's a reality to have to stop breastfeeding this week or not (that would NOT be fun). I have to be in a small group of women in my situation I know, but I thought I'd reach out for a little company if anyone feels like chiming in. Lots of love and good luck to us all, thanks for listening, ~Nina mom had BC (the following diagnosis is hers) Dx 10/26/2010, IDC, 2cm, Stage II, Grade 3, 0/4 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
