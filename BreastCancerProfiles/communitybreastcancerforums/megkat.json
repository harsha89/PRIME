This happened to me last year and it lasted for almost a month and my obgyn dismissed it saying it was an allergic reaction and that she didn't feel a lump. Well one year later in Dec 2011 I started having the same symptoms now worried I called the dr and she couldn't see me until 1/5/2012. I kept having the itchiness now with a lot of pain and I couldn't go to the appt due to my mom had surgery that day. Well on 1/12/12 I saw the dr and as she examined my breast she felt a small mass and she said it was moving she sent me to get an ultrasound and mammo and they came out clear. Now they called me yesterday cause she said she felt a lump and is sending me to a breast surgeon to get a 2nd opinion. I'm very scared I'm 33 yrs old and I'm a mother of two little girls I'm a thyroid cancer survivor and now I don't want to deal with this. My breast is not as itchy as it was and it still hurts but not as bad however my nipple looks like its pointing outward. I don't know what to think if someone could pls help me Log in to post a reply",
