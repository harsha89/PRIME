It doesn't feel soft and \"sloshy\" but has become quite firm. I do have a fairly high pain tolerance, but I don't want to let it go too long.  How long do I let it go before calling the doctor?   I don't want to overreact but also don't want to let it get out of hand. Not sure what to do at this point.  Dx 2/22/2012, DCIS, Grade 3, ER+/PR+ Log in to post a reply",

One side stung just a touch, the other not at all, and it's over so quickly. Compared with what you've been through thus far, believe me when I say that it's much better than having an IV put in or even a blood draw.  Now I can drive! Except I just tried it, and the seat belt hurt, and turning the wheel hurt, and I'm ready for a nap now.  Dx 2/22/2012, DCIS, Grade 3, ER+/PR+ Log in to post a reply",
