If you decide to buzz leave a 1/4 inch to avoid bumps and rashes. My eyebrows and lashes didn't fall out until I was a week out of my 12 Taxols. This was hard as I thought I was over the hump. Heavy sigh as my lashes fell out three additional times. Hopefully they will stick this time. I did purchase two wigs but really only ended up wearing one. Get some soft headcovers. Headcovers.com has a great selection. Stay strong!",

      "Content": "Apr 22, 2018 12:07PM - edited Apr 23, 2018 12:34PM by PhoenixCruiser I'm so glad I got a port. I also hate blood draws and with the port I only felt some pain twice and that was because she didn't hit my port. I was completely knocked out for the placement and for that I am grateful. I was back to work the next day however I work for home and that helped. I did however bruise badly and that bruising didn't fully go away for about 8 weeks, looked bad but didn't hurt.",
