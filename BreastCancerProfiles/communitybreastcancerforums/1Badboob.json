If you feel as though you want a mammogram you should get one, we all have to be our own best advocates. You have found a great site, I have found so much info on this site. I'm fairly new to all this. My whole family, DH not included has been so supportive, find out for sure, but it's probably, hopefully benign, but make sure it is and have it out anyway!  1badboob",

You will heal, physically, mentally, you will heal. There are postives, harder to find but there are, it's not invasive and it was very early stage, precancerous, all very very good things in the cancer world. You will find a new normal when you are further away from this. You're not alone.",

This is the worst time, a lot of women will tell you that. There is so much help out there and you are not alone, my best advice is to stay calm because this is a very bumpy ride. Keep all your paperwork, you should have something to keep them in anyway, bills, because this can be very overwhelming and bills don't just stop cause were feeling overwhelmed. You are not alone, there is so much help out there and treatment and many kinds of breast cancer, some are a lot less aggressive then others, knowledge is power. You will find all the support you need here feel free to PM me with any questions dear",
