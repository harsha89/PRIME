Will have second lumpectomy on Wednesday for more clear margins, then start chemo in April. A lot to wrap my head around.",

Second lumpectomy scheduled for tomorrow, want more clear margins. Kimg and fallschurchgirl - Oncotype was done to determine IF I would need chemo. It came back super high, 63! Doctor was surprised so high, although he felt I would need chemo. I\u2019m E positive, 100%. Best wishes to you all as you go thru this journey, I\u2019m right behind you. Debbie",

Even my MO was surprised it was that high. We are also heading out of town the weekend before I start to gear up, we are in California, heading to San Simeon to see Hearst Castle. Kinda had a melt down about wigs today, went to a wig shop. I\u2019m blonde and most of the wigs were very black and totally not me. Almost prefer to skip the whole wig thing and just go beanies and scarfs. To all the ladies of the March 2019 chemo club ....Thank you, thank you, thank you for your posts and experiences. It\u2019s helpful to get a preview of what we may be going thru. I don\u2019t post often, but I would be so lost without all of your posts and comments.",

That\u2019s amazing your tumor has shrunk so much. Great news. Hang in there, the worst is behind you. I\u2019ve had it pretty easy. Fatigue, underlying nausea for the most part. I know Friday thru Sunday will be laying around from bed to recliner. I just need to go with it and stop fighting it so much. I\u2019m pretty much a get up and do do do kinda person. Mostly positive attitude. Getting stuff done today from the steroids still in my system. I did have a cute visitor at the infusion center yesterday. Enjoyed his visit. Mini golden doodle. Well mini compared to my 80lb Goldens! ",
