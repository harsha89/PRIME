I always hear her voice in my head: \"Keep moving, ladies.\" This winter I've been doing lap swimming. I'm also taking a class to improve my strokes-it kicks my but but I feel like I am getting stronger. I also take aqua exercise once a week. For anyone who has not exercised in awhile or ever-I recommend the aqua exercise. It's very gentle on our bodies and I found I could do things in the water that I struggle with on land b/c of the bouyancy. Both of these classes are from my park district and cost next to nothing. I've been a certified yoga teacher for many years and was depressed because my poses got so bad after the cancer. But I've been practicing again for over 2 years and am slowly regaining some of the things I used to be able to do. I just have to be really patient with myself and keep trying. I am finally going back to normal classes. I was too embarrassed for a while because my body looks so different and I am no longer graceful and strong. Maybe I will be again at some point but now I don't care what anyone else thinks-the yoga helps me. I only go to teachers that I am comfortable with. I also try to walk every day. I'm so grateful that I can still get outside and walk and simply experience the joy of being alive. So thanks Z for all your inspiration-I\"ll join the crowd of ladies who \"Keep Moving!\"",

I went to my first yoga class since diagnosis last Saturday-it was a class for those recovering from cancer and it was great! The teacher kept me in restorative poses and worked on some of the gross asymmetries that developed when my left side was so full of fluid and tumors. I am going back for a week at the end of the month to be a \"student subject\" for teachers studying yoga therapy and am looking forward to it. I am not a parent so take my advice for what its worth. But I think it is time for you and DH to move forward in the ways that would make you two the happiest. You can give your kids fair warning but It would be nice if you and your husband could live together in the house that you want, rather than putting everything on hold. I know you will figure it out.

You might outlive your husband-seriously! None of knows our future but since you reported that your tumor markers are down, why not hope for the best? The best way to fxxx this cancer is to live today with gusto, the best that we can, and not let cancer ruin days that could otherwise be perfectly good. I am glad you are planning a getaway with your DH in October. I really related to an older post of yours of not wanting to go back to your old health club-but maybe until the weather breaks you can exercise indoors at home-running in place, to videos, etc until you can get back out there jogging.

For most of the 9 years I was strong, energetic and healthy. In early 2016 I noticed shortness of breath when I ran up stairs with a backpack in cold weather so I didn't think too much of it. Then as the year went on my shortness of breath got worse, I was coughing all the time, getting weaker and having trouble eating. I was still working but it got to the point where I could barely turn myself over in bed at night. Friends and family noticed so I finally saw a doctor. I am grateful to be alive, given that I let things go for so long. I honestly don't regret my choices.

I used to be really fit myself but now I am too self-conscious to go to the yoga classes I loved because I can't do half of what I used to. But I practice alone at home, and day by day am making slow progress. Today I decided to risk taking a hike with a \"meet-up\" type of group b/c I have been getting stronger. I was able to do the 10 miles but was so far behind the rest of the group-no one waited so I was hiking the whole time by myself. So I can definitely relate to wanting my old body back but I am trying to appreciate this new body which is trying so hard to be well and healthy again. Hope the rest of the weekend is good!",

Illimae-hope your rad treatment is short and sweet and does its work. I'm feeling good today. I started swimming again in August at the park district pool. First time I warned the life guard-I just said I hadn't swam in a long time. I did have to stop in the middle of each lap-they are 50 yards long but I felt good and free. Yesterday was my fifth time and I made it through every lap without stopping so it gave me a lift. After all my spinal mets it feels good to swim-like things are getting put back to the right place.

I found an indoor swimming pool and went for a swim last night. I have lived in my house for over 30 years and never realized that the pool in the high school that is a 5 minute walk away is open to the public during certain hours. I used to drive 45 minutes and pay $500/year just to swim. So I swam last night at 9 pm with two other women who were also not in the greatest shape. There was a poster: \"No matter how slowly you swim, you are lapping those who are on the couch.\" I think I have found a good place to swim! It was kind of amazing to realize that there are undiscovered treasures in this neighborhood where I've lived so long. Hope everyone has a good day.",

Hope there is more Oprah to come,Chelle. I was a \"patient\" at an Iyengar Yoga therapy workshop this week. One strange side effect from my cancer has been scoliosis. Between the spinal mets, and massive fluid and tumors on my left side before treatment, my spine got way out of whack. I have practiced and taught Iyengar yoga for years so it was kind of strange to simply be a \"patient\" but it is what I needed at this time, and I got a lot of insights on how I can reduce the scoliosis in my own practice. Micmel-I wanted to weigh in on your sister conundrum. I feel like you might have little to lose by meeting her for lunch. You don't have to commit to a relationship with her again but simply get together for an hour or two to see what she is like now and take it from there. If you were so close once, I think it might be worth a little time even though it must have been so painful for her to side with your ex in the divorce. Having lunch might confirm that you were right to stay away all these years or you might get the sense that you can be in each other's life again in some healthy way. I think people do grow and change, and that none of us are perfect. This is by no means the same intensity of a sister relationship but I mentioned before how a close friend \"ghosted\" me after my diagnosis but then has come around now that she saw I wasn't as sick as I was last fall. I decided to forgive-we have never mentioned it but I do enjoy her company. I'll never count on her to be there for me but I can still enjoy aspects of the friendship. I can look back at my own life-I haven't always been the perfect friend to people with cancer or the perfect sister. I think we all mess up and its worth giving each other grace, within limits. If the relationship is abusive or just totally draining, I also think it is fine to exercise self-care and detach from it. My two cents for what it is worth. Wishing everyone a happy, healing weekend.",

It was about how we often spend time reminiscing about the past or fearing the future instead of just living in the now. It hit home for me because I do spend a lot of time missing the person I was-who had so much energy and stamina and a body that I liked. I was always \"healthy\" and could eat and drink anything I wanted. I feel like I suddenly aged 20 years and it's jarring. I also spend a lot of time fearing the future-wondering what my life is going to be like if/when the cancer gets worse. The sermon made me realize how much of \"now\" I miss. I am trying to be more consciously in the now. Today I am going off to the beach-I am a little fatter now but as I look around there are a lot of people who are also fat but they seem to be having a good time! I just get into the water when I get hot and it is good. Glad you had a nice time with your daughter getting the dress altered. If you can, try swimming again this summer. It feels so good-my body can move in the water in ways that I can't on land. It just feels so much freer.",

Hope they can figure out what is causing that odd pain and especially hope it's not related to cancer. I had a good weekend myself-saw the friend who has been great during throughout these past several months, unlike other \"ghosts\" :). I tried a different group for a hike this Saturday-I was still the slowest but people made a point of slowing down to walk with me. Had a lot of fun and then saw a group of cousins and aunts, who much to my surprise, have also been very supportive. Today I've been on the phone with my health insurance thanks to a surprise $2,800 bill I received yesterday for a hospital stay last September! Fingers crossed-it may be a mistake and they are going to reprocess it. Hope everyone has a good day! ",

I even bought paint to repaint some rooms that badly need it.
