Oncologist suggested chemo and said he didnt pay attention to onco scores if one was node positive.  However I saw a study recently published called Swog 88 where they too 367 women with 1 to 3 positive nodes and gave 147 tamoxifen only and the remainder chemotheraphy and tamoxifen combined and at the 10 yr survival mark those that took chem and tamoxifen had an 87percent survival rate and those that took only tamoxifen alone had a 92 percent survival rate,  Makes me question the effectiveness of chemo and if I should do it at all,,,,,,,,,,Any adivice out there?
