I have made caps for many other BC patients also and I have loaned out the pattern too.  Give it a try, it makes feeling better so much easier.  You can purchase the pattern on line, just search McCalls Pattern 4116 and the web will take you right there, if you cannot sew maybe a family member or friend can help you out.

Great thread Ladies, thank you Gaynor",
