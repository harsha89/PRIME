      "Content": "TealJay wrote: I'm a few months shy of 29. I noticed a reddish rash/irritation on my left chest about two weeks ago. It's blotchy, sometimes redder than others and sometimes more brownish. It's size and location has remained the same. It does not itch. It is located slightly below my collarbone. This week, pain has begun. It started as soreness of my left breast at the beginning of the week. Followed by tenderness in the underarm. The pain has seemed to begin radiating down my arm.. The pain is worse at the end of the day. I called my gyno at the beginning of this week and was told to contact dermatologist. At the time, there was no pain to report. I have a dermatologist appointment tomorrow and I know that I will have to advocate for myself. Gyno said to call back If anything changed but I thought maybe go through with dermatologist first. I'm nervous about the resistance I've heard of everyone else meeting while knowing something was wrong. I'm nervous about the outcomes. I know my body and I know this is far from my normal. Any advice would be appreciated. Should I request a biopsy? Does this sound like IBC? Thank you Log in to post a reply",

After sharing that with my partner, we talked about the number of times in the last two weeks that I stated my bras were painful or bothering me on that side. I have not noticed warm ness. There is a skin texture change on the \u201crash\u201d that appears to be almost like ridges at times.  Again I thank you for the response and I will be praying for you",
