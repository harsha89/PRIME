I know it sounds too good to be true and you're probably wondering how come doctors don't tell you about this if it works, but it does! I can't recommend it enough it has done wonders for morale and self-esteem. I am a researcher and did a whole bunch of research on the subject before contacting the manufacturer and he's the one who suggested I come onto this board to talk to women who have had success with it.  While its not a garanteed success, with TC the success rate is about 90%. You will find a wealth of information on the \"cold cap users past and present\" board.If you are considering it, know that its a lot of work, but most users will tell you its worth it. Feel free to PM me if you would like more info or have any more questions.",
