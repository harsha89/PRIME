With tumor markers, though, it is important to look for trends of a few months, rather than a stand-alone number - i.e., compare TMs from one time to the next few. Also, one person's TM might be 2000, while another's might be 50, and yet their cancers could be of the same burden.  We differ in so many ways.  Some cancers just shed more than others and, thus, higher TMs. Hope this helps.  Take care....   Judi",

I wonder if being on estrogen will make me horny.  Heeeee. After the estrogen therapy, there is only one thing that is left - the platinum drugs - and they will likely not work well for me, if at all.  Gotta stop thinking 'bout that.  At least I think I'll make it through the Olympics since my organs are functioning well!

The bigger issue for me is that I'm not sure about entering a clinical trial.  I am embarrassed to write that I don't think I could do it for several reasons.  One is that I can't drive - too wobbly right now.  The biggest one is that I am scared to death of scans and close monitoring.  I have not ever allowed my onc more than one scan per year, even in the midst of extensive mets to lungs, liver, and bones.  It has been one and a half years since my last scans.  I just cannot tolerate the worry.  Cannot and will not. I did this mets journey since 2001 and had my onc change treatments mainly based on blood work.  He was never happy about that and I don't blame him.  But I had to do it my way or I wasn't going to do it at all.  Sounds like a bratty child.  I have gone to the onc every single month for over 8 years and worried like heck about blood work every single one of those 96 months.  I just could not do regular scanning.  It would have messed with my already sometimes shaky QOL by worrying about scans.  I am unlikely to change now.   But I have made it 8-1/2 years with mets and that's pretty darn good. Sorry for the babbling.  I do very much appreciate your thoughts and all the work.  I will likely look at them after I've calmed down from the events of this afternoon.

I have written to the web site and asked them to correct their statement.  One needs to be very very very careful about believing whatever you read on the Internet.

I am surprised you go on Thursdays; it has always been my impression for 8 years that the breast cancer docs have clinics on Tuesdays.  I go on Tuesdays.  You have a long drive to Ann Arbor!  I live about 10 minutes from U of M.  Lucky me.  Ha. I'm very careful when it comes to Googling.  Up until two years ago, I was a health sciences researcher for the Dept. of Veterans Affairs and conducted studies and published papers (even a smallish study on the factors that contribute to women's decision on what type of treatment to pursue if they had options - the majority chose whatever their onc suggested, regardless of the fact that the survival rates were the same - not surprising, but the study was fun to do).  Anyway, my education and career were research based and I learned not to trust anything I read, but, rather, to read at least the abstracts of studies to determine whether the study results were valid and reliable.  So, I generally take with a grain of salt whatever results I get from googling, unless I am familiar with the author(s). Anyway, it makes me feel good to help.  And I truly miss working.  I loved my job.  Sigh.  Whatever will be will be.  I wish you and everyone a truly blessed New Year.     Judi P.S.  I love the cod liver oil over your liver!  That's a new one and quite fun to have read!  Heeeee.",

I've had very little radiation - just 2 weeks to my spine and 2 weeks to my eye for eye mets.  I got tired, but mostly tired of having to go everyday. I've lost count of the number of chemo cycles.  I was dx'd at Stage IV over 8 years ago and have tried nearly every chemo available.  I responded to all of them - for varying lengths of time.  I was never really NED or in remission.  A lot of women experience NED, even at Stage IV, but I was not one of them.  Unfortunately, there is only one or maybe two chemos left to try, but I've had a great 8 years - well, the first 6 years were great, but not the last two when I had to quit work.  All of a sudden, my markers were out of sight and I lost most of my energy - walking became difficult and still is.  I quit work 2 years ago, but for the 6 years prior to that, I worked hard as a health services research specialist and loved it, travelled a whole bunch, and just pretty much lived my life as I did pre-BC.  Alas, things are different now, but I still consider myself blessed and lucky to have had 6 great years, despite being on chemo nearly all of that time (I got a couple of years on anti-hormonals). Your baby is adorable!  I can't imagine chasing around such a wee one, but I know that it is worth it.  I am single and mom to a 13-year old devil in a fur dress - my cat.  She's all I can manage! I, too, take Xanax at night.  Generally works well, but I find myself not wanting to go to sleep and finally turn off the TV at around 2 a.m. and don't wake up till about noon.  It shouldn't matter - don't have to go anywhere, but I'd like to get up earlier. I hurt my foot and knee about 2 months ago and have had to use a walker since then.  But they are getting better - finally.  My knee kept buckling and it is scary.  My best friend comes over 1X per week to straighten up and run errands for me.  I am forever thankful for her. What treatment are you on?  I know so little about IBC.  I feel so bad for you to have been diagnosed while so very young, but I can tell you are a fighter and I have a feeling that you will do well. Pls free to post any questions for me.  I'll try to answer.  But, again, my memory sucks.  For the first year after my dx, I lived in downtown Detroit, so I had a bit of a drive, too.  Not nearly as long as yours, but I also worked at the Dept. of Veterans Affairs in Ann Arbor, so did the drive nearly everyday of the week.  But then I bought a condo in Ann Arbor and being so close has been great. Please feel to also email me if you like.  Email is judiz@umich.edu Glad the new year is off to a good start.  I hope that 2010 brings you much joy.  Take care. Judi",

This is what I've read - on a reputable site: \"Most of the websites or magazines promoting laetrile base their claims on unsupported opinions and anecdotal evidence. There IS NOT any evidence that laetrile is an effective treatment for cancer or any other illness. The USA's National Cancer Institute reviews the results of clinical research into the use of laetrile for cancer on its website. One animal study claimed that B17 slowed the growth of cancer in animals and helped stop tumours spreading to the lungs. But repeated studies COULD NOT show similar results, so the treatment remains unproven.\"  From:  www.cancerhelp.org.uk I'm rather cynical about such things that are described as \"highly effective\" without seeing the studies - on humans - to back up the claims.  I'd love to see such studies if you have the citations.  Please reference them, if you would.  I'm interested. The only vitamin that I have taken based on human study results of this past summer is Vitamin D.  And I only take the amount that several Vitamin D experts told me was appropriate. One needs to be very, very careful when reviewing the so-called evidence.  The bottom line is that it is always recommended that you read the actual studies upon which \"evidence\" is based.   Best of luck.

My next step will be estrogen and, if that does not work, to try one of the platinum drugs.  Neither has a high likelihood of working.  After that, well there's pretty much nothing. So, I would like to hear from anyone else who is grasping at straws, scrounging - i.e., scraping the bottom of the barrel for treatment options.  I still feel well.  Anyone out there going through the same thing?

Take care. P.S.  I also get the CEA - another tumor marker test.   P.P.S.  I'm not a \"good little patient\" either!!  :>)  I could not be otherwise.  However, after nearly 8 years of mets, I no longer do much research, but I totally agree with LuAnn - oftentimes we must be out own advocate to make sure we are getting the best possible treatment available.  Good luck to you!  Judi",
