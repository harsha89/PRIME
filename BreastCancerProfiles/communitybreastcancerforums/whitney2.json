Just last month my aunts doctor tells her that she has to immediately get her breasts re examined, because one of the cysts that was found was \"unknown\". He told her this months after the results came back, when he could have told her a long time ago. She went back to the imaging office yesterday and when I was on the phone with her...she sounded like she had been crying. She didn't sound like she knew anything for sure (because her crying would be very apparent if she knew she had cancer) but she sounded like maybe the doctor told her something was suspicious. I am afraid to even ask because I don't even want to know....I am constantly thinking about what would happen if she has cancer.  From what I know, she had no symptoms of breast cancer months ago and she still doesn't. I know she had cysts in her ovaries and she always did. She also had many cysts in her breasts and only one came back as being unknown. So I not only have to worry about breast cancer, but being she got her ovaries re checked I have to worry about that too. My question is, they spotted this \"unknown\" cyst in her breats 5 months ago. If it were cancer...wouldn't she be displaying some sort of symptoms by now? She is exactly the same as she was then. She is 50 years old by the way and I am not sure but I think she is going through menopause (or premenopause).   I am just afraid and I can't stop thinking about it.  I don't understand why she has cysts in her ovaries and breasts and that makes me twice as afraid. But like I said, she isn't displaying any signs of breast cancer and it's been 5 or 6 months since they spotted something. How long does it take to progress? The only thing I've noticed that has changed in her over the past year is her mood swings have been worse. That could easily be explained as menopause and I've notcied since she has been on zoloft she is acting much better. Log in to post a reply",
