It took till February of 2016 when I was finally staged at IV with bone mets. I was started on the lurpon shot then Letrozole and Ibrance with Zometa infusions (once a month). Last summer I had my ovaries removed to get off the lurpon. I will not have surgery and my doctors will not reduce or take me of any meds. This is the course of treatment ... forever. It has been a rough road but my results are amazing and I couldn't ask for better treatment. I deal with the fatigue. bone, back and hip aches but I will take it to have the results I am getting. Besides dealing with having cancer, my husband and I also deal with the loss of my sex drive and it has put a major strain on our marriage. I am only 41 years old and he is 39. It is basically gone. I feel like one day it was alive and thriving and the next...poof gone like it never happened. I have explained to him how I feel, the medicine, etc but its not helping. We just started marriage counseling and today I feel like its just getting worse. I feel like I am at my lowest now when I am getting the best results and things should be happy. I am a Christian woman and I know God had a plan for us and right now.. I need some support from women who I can relate to. I try talking to my friends but they just don't understand. I also welcome any advice on how to get my head in the game. I don't like porn and toys have never been my thing... I don't feel comfortable in my skin. Please ladies help me keep my focus and not get so down on myself. Thank you! Log in to post a reply",
