I agree that you have plenty of hair to \"go bare\" outside, but I also understand the instinct to put a cap on it! I am towards the end of my weekly Taxol regime, but I'd say I have about the same thinning as you do. I find that the more shallow caps (runner's caps) are better for me than the larger, regular baseball caps which seem gigantic on my head. I also bought one \"chemo cap\" which fits snuggly, comes down low so I can tuck in my ears, and is a fun color. I like wearing headscarves too, but I need to build up my endurance for them. I've found that after a few hours, it feels itchy/claustophobic. I'm working on it. Also, my 9 year old much prefers that I wear caps instead of scarves. With the caps, no one looks twice. With the scarves, \"People ask me about you and I don't want to talk about it.\" Fair enough.I'm working on building his endurance/toughness too. :-) This may sound crazy, but I bought myself a bright red lipstick yesterday and I think it makes a BIG difference in my confidence level. I don't usually wear much makeup and most of my lips balms are neutral tints. The color really made my face feel brighter and not so washed out. Hang in there ladies! ~Hugs from Colorado",

      "Content": "Jul 2, 2017 06:01PM T-Sue wrote: Hi Folks \u2013 I'm new to the BC community and thought I'd introduce myself. I was diagnosed in late March with one small tumor and a plan for a lumpectomy and radiation. After a MRI revealed a second small tumor in the same breast, the plan changed to mastectomy which I decided to supersize to a double mastectomy to get rid of as much of my high-risk breast tissue as possible. When the pathology on the second tumor came back HER2 positive, the plan expanded to include chemo. *sigh* My bilateral mastectomy took place in late April and I was relieved that my lymph nodes came back benign. I'm now four treatments into my 12 weekly low-dose Taxol chemo regimen. So far the side effects on weekly Taxol have been tolerable \u2013 fatigue on days 1-3 but not crushing. I have trouble sleeping most nights; I take Ativan on days 1-3 but am trying to wean off of sleep aids starting on day 4. (Unsuccessfully \u2013 I'll often take a couple Tylenol PM pills after lying in bed awake for an hour.) Actions that I think have helped me (or at least that I can control) are walking outside for 30-60 minutes a day, downing water to move the chemicals out of my system, and eating enough calories and protein to keep my energy levels up. I've been amazed to keep my full head of hair this long. (Before diagnosis I had long hair and have slowly been cutting it off to help my 9yo son get used to mommy without hair.) Alas, it's giving up the fight and coming out oodles. It's not noticeable yet, but I have hats and scarves to cover up when things get patchy. I also have a wig on standby if I need to do a full head shave (thank you American Cancer Society!) I appreciate you all sharing the details of your experiences. It has been so helpful to me as newcomer. Happy Fourth of July!",

Although I haven't been super active in this group, I follow the conversations and appreciate everyone's advice and sharing. Here's a little about me personally. I am a Coloradan \u2013 47 years old with a husband and a 9 year old son. I am a teacher though the past few years I've been contracting part time in professional development (either by travelling to teacher trainings or working on presentations remotely from my home office). When I was diagnosed in March I had to let go of all of my travelling contracts for the remainder of the year. I hope to pick up some remote work again this fall when I complete chemo treatment. My son and I have homeschooled the last two years which one of the best decisions I've ever made. Our lives were pretty disrupted this past spring as I was dealing with my initial diagnosis and the slew of calls and appointments and a double mastectomy. Fortunately I had signed my kiddo up for a bunch of terrific summer camps and we have enough friends on summer break that he is keeping busy during my \"summer of chemo\" and I don't have to worry about us missing \"school.\" One of the things that has astounded me is how friends and family have stepped up to help out in so many different ways. There's a meal train and taking my kid during appointments but there is also texts to pick up groceries, help with gardening, and this weekend a scarf party that a girlfriend hosted. My husband and I dubbed this whole thing \"Project 2nd Base\" (see my profile pic \u2013 a T-shirt from a friend) which we nickname \"Project 2B\" for my son who thinks it means Projects 2 breasts Here's a picture of me in my new wig (thank you American Cancer Society!) and a sassy scarf.

I think the just over midway stage can be tough for us because it feels like we should be celebrating, but it also seems like I drag myself into the ring for beating every Monday. My MO also attributed it to the chemo kicking my body into early menopause. She also prescribed a low-dose antidepressant which I started last week. It is supposed to take a couple weeks to kick in, but I already feel better knowing that we are addressing it; or maybe it's a placebo effect.

It's a very personal decision and I don't judge anyone's decision, I can just share my thinking and justification. The chance of recurrence in my \"healthy\" breast was high enough that I didn't want to risk going through a SECOND mastectomy and round of chemo 5, 10, 30 years down the road. My dense breast tissue has always been hard to mammogram, so I've had enough call backs over the years to look at suspicious shadows that I knew I didn't want to continue to have that annual stress. The double mastectomy with tissue expanders was surely more involved than a single mastectomy, but my thinking was to get it all done at once rather than potentially split it up into two procedures. Also, I'd heard from enough women who had a single MX that they and their PS had trouble making the two breasts 'match.' Many of them had additional surgeries to get the two more symmetrical. I've read many many articles about how doctors and patients shouldn't be removing healthy breasts, but I just don't buy it for myself. I have no regrets about it and am relieved to know that my risk of recurrance is lower.",

They walk you through every step of makeup application with your new big bag of fancy cosmetics. I haven't had so much practice since I was a teenager with a teen magazine in the bathroom trying not to poke my eye out with a mascara wanna. They also had some tips for wearing wigs and we did some scarf tying practice.  My training did not have wigs available, though I DID receive a free wig from ACS through my facility's Breast Cancer Navigator. Saved a ton of money definitely worth looking into. ",

I began my treatment in early June and have my FINAL Taxol next Monday after twelve consecutive weekly treatments. I'm thrilled to be nearing the end. Many treatments seems to be 12-16 weeks, so many of you must be nearing the end of chemo also. We can make it! I know that there is more ahead (for me: Herceptin infusions every 3 weeks for a year and a reconstruction surgery in a few months) though it will be wonderful to have this chemo step behind me.

We came up with all sorts of profanity-laden names, but settled on \"Project 2nd Base\" to refer to my b.c. diagnosis and treatment. Around my child, we call it Project 2B which we explained stood for both '2 breasts' or 'to be.' My friends took off with the name and set up a FB support group and meal train with that name and got tshirts to show solidarity. Humor helps 😁",

Wrapping my brain around one diagnosis and surgery and then have it switch to a different one really threw me for a loop. I felt so out of control! I will say that, looking back, I am glad to have all of my breast tissue removed and to never have to face another mammogram. I've been pretty happy with the results of my breast reconstruction. It was so helpful to find a good PS who was able to talk me through the choices and his recommendations. Good luck with your decisions!",
