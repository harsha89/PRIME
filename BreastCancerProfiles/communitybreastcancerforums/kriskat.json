I did alot if research to see what would be easiest on my fragile hair. The great length ext are expensive but they typically last around 9 months if taken care of properly. U need to someone who has alot of experience. I go in about every 4 weeks for color at the roots( my hair grows fast). It was the single best thing I could've done for my self esteem. My husband couldn't believe how it transformed me mentally back to my old self !! If someone would like to see pics please pm me and I would be happy to send u a couple!",
