I went in thinking that they were going to want to remove the entire lump b/c that is what I was told by the radiologist. To my suprise, the breast surgeon said, \"Sweetheart, you are too young, it's probably just benign there is so much going on there that I wouldn't even know where to biopsy.\"  I'm a bit angry to say the least that it appeared her clinical judgement was strongly swayed by my age. My two friends who recently lost their lives were told the exact same thing \"you're young, nothing to worry about.\"    Some background: At 24, doctors did not take my symptoms seriously b/c my bloodwork always 'looked good'. At 27 my heart tissue, lungs and kidney's swelled causing permanent damage. Doctors then took me seriously and I was dx with Systemic Lupus and finally able to start treatment to make me feel somewhat normal again.  While I'm terrified of finding out what a biopsy might yeild, after reading all of your posts I'm realizing that it's like my dx of lupus...it will give me piece of mind either way. The doctor today was even more reason to advocate for those of us in our 30's who get disregarded. If my friends were still here they would be pushing me to get a second opinion so that is what I'm going to do.  Thank you again for all your support. It really was helpful to read all your posts this morning, I dont think I would have made it to the appointment otherwise.  Big hugs, L",

The second surgeon felt it was necessary to get all the tissue out b/c it is a large thickening/mass and is asymetrical.Trying to stay positive. The doc said she highly doubts its cancer but wants it out. Finally, I'll get to know exactly what this strange thing is going on in there. Another question though, both surgeons have recommended that I get genetic testing/counseling done due to my strong family history. I do see some of the benefits but have learned a long the way that insurance companies will find a loop hole wherever they can to not pay for proceedures or to decline you health insurance. While the law is out there for pre-existing conditions it is far from perfect and continues to happen. Any thoughts?",

I'm sending lots of positivity your way! @ Julie, Thank you. Currently I have good insurance but I'd like to move out of state someday and not sure if insurance companies would deny me in the future. Guess I should read up more about it and talk to the genetic person. RIght now, I'm much more stressed about having surgery than the results. Thank you for your support and calming thoughts.",

When I said to the radiologist, \"Ok, good...that is good news!\" his tone changed and he indicated that bc the mass was palpable, oblong and he could not define the edges. He recommended that I treat this agressivly and have it removed. Since then I've noticed a lot of swelling in the area of dense tissue and lots of 'branch' like projections from the lump towards my armpit and what feel to be swollen lymph nodes in my armpit. I'm thinking in my non-medical opinion it's just an infection with no fever, This past year I've lost two friends in their early thirties to breast cancer, both were told they had fibroadenoma's....one passed less than two months after her dx and the other just short of 2 years after. I really don't want to have surgery and am thinking of canceling my appointment tomorrow b/c I'm scared of what the results might yeild. My intuition tells me something is wrong but I keep trying to tell myself that I'm too young, its just an infection, this couldn't possibly be happening, lightning wouldn't strike a third time especially with something so rare for my age. I'm really struggling on whether or not to go ahead with the procedure. It's almost like I just don't want to know. Has anyone else experienced this ambivalence or have words of advice?

While I can't answer your question about nodular density I will say that this site has been helpful in getting me through all this waiting, There is lots of support here from women who have been through a range of experiences. Hopefully, you'll find it as helpful as I have... I'll be keeping you in my thoughts.  Big hugs, L",

I'm happy to say though that finally this strange large lumpy thingy is out! The surgeon indicated that she thinks its probably just an abnormal growth of normal glandular tissue. I'll know for sure when the pathology report comes back. I'm not going to lie, I'm a little taken back at how large the incision is, I'm very small up top it takes up 2/3 of the side of my breast! (eek). That part I wish the doc would have informed me prior to the surgery so I wasn't so shocked. As I sit here typing with a bag of frozen pea's over top my incision site its safe to say overall I'm in pain but feeling relieved. No matter what the outcome of the pathology report.....l will have an answer so we can move forward as needed. Thanks again for all the support. I'm still researching the genetic testing. I do know my insurance will cover it but it's more the question of how much do you want on your medical record especially if you haven't been dx with cancer. It's been hard enough to navigate insurance companies with a dx of Lupus so I'm just being cautious and want to be informed . Nite all, big hugs and thanks again",
