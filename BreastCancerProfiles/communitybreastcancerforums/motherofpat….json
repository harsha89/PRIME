I want my daughter to go after her cancer aggressively and take every step to prevent reccurance. She has no choice about chemo due to one node positive. My fear is that too many woemn are being under treated only to come back to 2 to 5 yrs with another tumor.",

It is a dangerous drug and should not be used by cancer patients. I found sites selling products with it in and with no cautions about the estrogen production. WOW - so many things to learn. I will NOT be giving it to my daughter when it arrives. So very glad I found out about it before hand. THANKS. Even things suggested on this site must be investigated since every woman's cancer is different - especially the differences among the ER and PR rate of expression. As for ice mitts and socks - How cold do they need to be?",

In your case if both areas were removed and tested, you would have a better picture of what is going on. If they are telling you that you need tamox, then you must have a hormone positive cancer. I don't think tamox is a routine preventive drug. Can you get another doctor to take your case? Sounds like you need to go outside the system you are in. Can you get copies of the test results and all your medical history? It is always a good idea to get your own copies.",

Doc seems a bit old school on this issue but since he even admits that AI's are better than Tamox, I don't get his hesitation. I had no issues with menopause since I had a hysterestomy at age 29 and never knew when my periods stopped - no hot flashes, maybe because I was on Prozac. What has your experience been? Seems it is safer to get them out and stop the estrogen.",
