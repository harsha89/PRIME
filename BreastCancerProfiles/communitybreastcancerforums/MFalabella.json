I live a state away from my family (besides hubby and kids) and am trying to figure out how this all will work, I feel so alone with this. I will be meeting MO on Tuesday to finalize the details of my chemo, i.e, start date, port placement etc. I pray daily for all of you and hope that you are dealing well with the treatment and the stress of it. I love my medical team and cancer center, I just wish my family could be here to help. Gentle hugs to all  xoxoMichelle",

My biggest issues is that my family is back in AZ, and here it is only my hubby and kids,....I miss my sister and my nieces so much right now. My mom passed away 10 years ago from cancer so I also don't have that support. You guys are all I have and I don't want to always be \"poor me\" Forgive me. I hope you all are well and that SE are minimal. I would post a pic of my egg head (lost it on day 13 after first infusion) but I don't know how. This is when I buzzed my head prior to my first chemo. Love and light to you all xoxoMichelle ",

I knew I would need chemo after my surgery, I was told there was a 1cm tumor in my sentinel node. That pretty much guarantees chemo. You should find out your cocktail soon. It must be a short round if you arent getting a port placed. That is what I understand anyway. I have to have a port because I am doing AC+T it will 12 weeks every three weeks for the ac and 12 weeks of Taxol weekly. I'd be a pin cushion without the port. Anyway, welcome, we have a great group of ladies here. Gently hugs, blessings and prayers, xoxoMichelle.....",

VLH, I will continue to send up prayers that your infection leaves your poor body alone and goes away, I am just starting to pack my chemo bag. I sure appreciate all of the info on here so I dont over do it. I just got a call from a peer counselor from the American Cancer Society, and I feel 10 pounds lighter, it was so nice to actually speak to another women who has walked in our shoes. I left all my family in Arizona to move to NM near my stepson. So support and prayer are always nice (and necessary). I hope all of you beautiful women are having good days, and for those of you who are not feeling well, I offer gentle hugs,   xoxoMichelle",

She went over all of the side effects and gave me instructions on what to do on Friday. I am scared, but glad to be here with you all. Love and Blessings, P.S. I got a super cute wig from the ACS that looks like me. I looked it up and it was a $180.00 wig! they also gave me a sleep cap, wig stand, a knitted warm cap and a wig snug band. They were amazing, dont forget to look up Look Good Feel Better, they supply advice and a makeup bag full of high end products! xoxoMichelle",

Talk about happening out of the blue. yesterday none, and this morning, I noticed my buzz looking thinner, and shower time, that experience..... . The D has slowed down, and I am feeling pretty decent today, Just in time for chemo next Friday lol. SO the fatigue is cumulative huh? Oh great, I thought I was exhausted this time. I am generally a positive person, but to be honest starting yesterday, I thought out of nowhere, What if the chemo doesn't work? I scared myself and hardly slept last night, I kept it to myself, didn't want to upset my husband. Do you all experience this or am I just being a debbie downer? I hope you all are well, and the SE are minimal. Lmenckin, the fuzzy brain is most likely the steroid that they give prior to the chemo drugs....at least it was for me, the chemo fog started about a day later. Love and light to you all,  xoxoMichelle",

Also, in the next couple of weeks, a sentinel lobe dye test will be done to see if I have any nodes involved. They didn't find anything on the ultrasound and they can't feel anything with examination. I will keep you all posted. xoxo Michelle",
