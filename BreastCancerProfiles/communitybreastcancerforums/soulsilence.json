I went to the doctors last month, in which they gave me a sonogram. they founded multiple lumps in both breast, but there`s one thats much bigger than the others, which I had a biospy today. the lump is HUGE similar to this one : I also discover that I have another lump under my armprit. I`m pretty freak out. this biopsy hurts and gives me a burning sensation. My follow up will be in 2 weeks! hopefully everything turns out well <3 My mom`s family do have history of cancer but not exactly breast cancer.. can I still inherite it? Log in to post a reply",

The doctor told me that I could leave there but its NECESSARY to get it out. My only concern is that im only 18 and I dont know how can  it affect me later in the future. Also, if I do get it done, what kind of anethesia would they give me? Log in to post a reply",
