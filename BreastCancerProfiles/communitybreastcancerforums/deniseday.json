I just want to encourage you that it is absolutely doable.  It may be more difficult since you are recovering from surgery as well.  I worked almost everyday.  There is no question that losing my hair and coping with that may have been the hardest part.  I had a son get married and moved my baby girl 5 hours away to college.  I hated being the mom with the scarf on my head, but somehow we manage to get through it.  I have surgery scheduled for 10-28 and I'm so very nervous about the outcome from the path reports.  My post chemo MRI show very little decrease in the size of the largest tumor, but it didn't grow, so I guess that is good.  I feel some knots under my arms, so naturally I'm worried about lymph nodes. I will pray for you all the best and if I can be of any help getting through chemo, just let me know.  this is such a strong group of women.  Happy thoughts are being sent your way, Denise",
