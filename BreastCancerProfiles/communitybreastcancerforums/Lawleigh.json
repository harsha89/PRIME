My best to all of you and I will try hard to be a better forum buddy this go round then just popping in from time to time. Leigh",

I suppose that makes me a May gal, but so many of my chemo thread girls are here it just feels right to be here. I had my appt where they did my cat scan and put my tattoos on...3 is all.  I questioned them for the 100th time I am sure about the organs.  They told me that yes the heart, lungs and ribs will get hit slightly however the lungs are the ones that they are the most concerned about as the portion of the heart that they are hitting is so small and the heart is extremely tough and can take it (but I only have one of them I explained).  The ribs or any bones can take a lot of radiation without any damage....ok, I guess we will see.  They keep a close look on the lungs even though they get hit very slightly. As far as what cream to use they told me that they will give me anything that I need.  Of course I had already read all the March posts and was all ready to order what I thought seemed best...guess I will hold off. Very glad to be through one more phase of this journey but really ready for hair and new boobs (that will be my husbands Christmas gift if I have the timing right).  Anyone know when you should go see the plastic surgeon for the first time. We called before surgery even and they said they wanted to wait til I was through treatment.  I am thinking once I start radiation we can make a game plan. Thanks for reading my ramblings Leigh",

Thanks for all the support and advice and we will make it through this.",
