So it seems I am a part of a phase 3 trial justÂ tweeking dose and timing otherwise drugs (cocktail) are the same. Ya know I started on this sight with the not diagnosed but worried section, then onto surgery before during and after, now I am in the June chemo group. Some of the people I have met along the way have been very kind and I appreciate there support. Now I am moving into a new group and they are staying behind, at least for now. I look forward to making new friends and finding new info and levels of support. I have to admit though the thought of chemo is daunting. I am gratefull to those that have been here done that and I am sorry for those that join me here this June. There is strength in community and numbers and I believe we will get through this together and from here move on, after here is radiation therapy and then reconstruction for me. Thanks for reading, god bless. Robin",

I believe it is you younger women who will make great strides in finding a cure or at least the best treatments for the next generation. Keep a positive out look and keep fighting the good fight. Keep us all informed and lets us know what happens in the follow up tests. There are a lot of agencies that can help with medical costs, I do not know if they will help with experimental treatment, but it might be worth a check. I wish you many blessing. Robin",
