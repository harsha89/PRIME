Vent all you need and want. That's what we are here for. This group of folks has been very supporting, informative and welcoming to me. Being a newbie, it's my first chance to pay it forward. You learn quickly that these folks have your back. Do you have your plan in place going forward? I know that helped me. Confidence in my team has made a huge difference. SIngle mastectomy and no reconstruction as I have MS and the neuro and surgeon agreed it would be a more intense recovery. So let yourself vent, grieve, cry. No need to put on a front. I hope you have a supportive family and friends and add us to the list to help you.",

I had left side removed back in Feb. and needed to wait to see how recovey went before deciding this. I have MS and did have a flare. A bit better, but still dealing with bowel issues. We have our home on the market and today we rec'd an offer that sounds great. What terrible timing. Our home is in a rural area, so if we don't accept it may be a very long wait for another buyer. Love my home, love my room and front porch. But love the grandbaby 500 miles away even more. I hope everyone heals well. Never did ask my stats, but considering I'm number 6 in the family, I'd say outrageously high. Besides I point blank asked efficacy ratings, Tamoxifen 30 percent, A.I.'s 50 percent, PMX 90 percent. No nasty side effects and with MS and other health issues, those drugs are not a good match.",

Curious had mentioned in a prior posting that Papillary Carcinoma is a rather rare b.c. and it's important to have second pathology opinions. In my case the slides were first viewed by a local Pathologist and automatically reviewed by Wake Forest Cancer Center Pathology Dept. AliceBastab, My guess was similar to your idea. The fine needle biopsy pulled the carcinoma cells but not the encapsulated wall (is it called collagen?). With EPC being a rare b.c., perhaps it's possible the local pathologist has not viewed this type of b.c. in the past. ",

      "Content": "Irishlove wrote: I wonder if you were restaged after biopsy showed one stage and final pathology showed another stage? Having read posts about the difficulties in pathology based on a small tumor sample, versus the final path report after a lumpectomy or mastectomy, I suppose it's not out of the question. Wondering how common this is? Would a vaccuum assisted biopsy have made a difference? Has anyone been restaged from a higher stage to a lower stage? In my case, I went from IDC, stage 1A, to Encapsulated Papillary Carcinoma, stage 0! I know I'm very, very lucky. But I also know that I may have opted out of a mastectomy had I known. It's too late to change anything. I struggled with mental health anxiety, that lead me to a PMX 2 1/2 months after first MX. The final pathology showed benign but precancerous papillomatosis (did no show on mammo, mri or ultrasound). I did have very dense breast tissue.
