Evidently the doctors around here think they are gods. They make the decisions. I told her that I wanted them both off and she said no only one. I sat there like what???? I was not impressed with her when she operated on me in '09. After she said only one I thought...YOU'RE FIRED!  In the beginning of this year I started to feel a burning feeling in my left breast. It felt like someone was branding me from the inside. By March there was 2 lumps in the same breast, again. The biopsy showed that it was not a recurrence but a new cancer (T.N.). My breast is trying to kill me. The new surgeons tell me that it is my choice if I want one or both off. They are there to work for me. The PS is going to put in implants. He is going to take my nipple, the good one, and cut it in half so I will have nipples when I come out of surgery. He'll tattoo the areola later. Has anyone have a pain pump that delivers Novocain? It numbs the pec muscles  so I won't need narcotics. He spent over an hour and a half talking to me and DH.  I felt good by the time we left. I have been lurking here all month. I appreciate everyone sharing their experiences. I am trying not to worry too much about this operation. Maybe the night before I'll be a complete mess but not now.  Valerie",

I guess I must have been to calm. I told hein that right now I feel that the cancer is like a cold. No big thing. He asked if it was because I went through it before. I said no, I think I am in denial. Or maybe I feel good about my new team of doctors. I really don't know. Maybe it is a little of both. He turns to my husband and tells him maybe it won't hit me for two years. But when it does, look out. Over the weekend I thought about it. I think I am in a fight mode like I kinda was last time. When it was all over I got worse after everything was done with and I was left alone. You know, like after radiation...the last treatment-you walk out and that's it. ou don't see anyone for three months after seeing them every day. I think that's what going to happen here. OR when I see myself breastless for the first time. Right now I just want to get rid of the cancer. I've been following everyone who went through surgery this month. Hope everyone is healing nicely.

They said women who had undergone chemotherapy for breast cancer had significantly less activity in parts of the brain responsible for executive functioning tasks compared with breast cancer patients who were not treated with chemotherapy. Among those treated with chemotherapy, the study also found a strong correlation between women who complained they were having trouble with memory and thinking skills and actual deficits in these regions of the brain. The study may help explain why many breast cancer patients complain of \"chemo brain\" -- a term used to describe foggy thinking and memory lapses following treatment with chemotherapy. \"This is a huge validation for these women who are telling their doctors 'something is wrong with me',\" said Shelli Kesler of Stanford University School of Medicine in California, whose study appears in the Archives of Neurology. Kesler said the conventional thinking is that chemotherapy drugs cannot cross a protective membrane called the blood-brain barrier that protects the brain from toxins. And doctors have dismissed women's complaints of brain deficits after chemotherapy, chalking them up to exaggeration and stress related to the cancer. \"This shows that when a patient reports she's struggling with these types of problems, there's a good chance there has been a brain change,\" Kesler said. Her study involved 25 breast cancer patients who had been treated with chemotherapy, 19 breast cancer patients who had surgery and other treatments, and 18 healthy women. All were asked to perform a card-sorting task that involves problem-solving skills while their brain activity was monitored through functional magnetic resonance imaging or fMRI. The women also completed questionnaires to assess their own cognitive abilities. As in prior studies of cancer patients, the team saw significant reductions in activity in two parts of the prefrontal cortex, including one used for working memory, cognitive control and monitoring. But they also found significantly reduced activation of an additional region of the prefrontal cortex linked with executive function -- the area of the brain needed for planning. Women in the chemotherapy group were also found to make more errors on the card-sorting task and take longer to complete it than healthy women and cancer patients who were not treated with chemotherapy. While a finding in 25 women seems small, Kesler said it is large for a brain scan study and points to a need to start identifying which women who undergo chemotherapy are most vulnerable to these types of deficits. She said future studies should be done in which women are tested before they undergo chemotherapy to determine the impact of treatment on brain function. Women are increasingly surviving their breast cancer, with breast cancer survivors comprising 22 percent of the nearly 12 million cancer survivors in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

I went to another doctor and she felt it was b.c. after feeling it. She immediately did a FNA the same day. The first week of June I had tests done every day. First I chose to do chemo to get it out of the way, then surgery and last rads. I did 4 rads with 31 more to go. Chemo was doable. But the chemo nurses were the best. They were caring, personable and very fun. I miss them until I go to have the port flushed. But they are the best! My thyroid surgeon thinks I have hurtle cell cancer of the thyroid.

The cat scan and ultra sound showed the same questionable spot with no definate answer. I guess they want to make sure if it is cancer or not before I get the port taken out in two weeks.

The ocologist replied that if I have a plastic surgeon do anything to them that it would only make them look worse.

I told her that I am constantly reminded of my cancer when I come to the hospita for an apintment and see all the patients. My best friend is stage 4 and has outlived the 6 months the doctor gave her to live. I go to 2 support groups, see a therapist and have a phone therapist. She listened and then she got a nurse and a case worker. Last night I saw a different therapist, actually the psycologist that is inthe same building as my therapist. She says I have PTSD and lots of underlying problems to. The scars aren't the real problem. We talked for two hours. I like her because she argues with me. I need that. I worry because I am triple negative. I ave to wait and see if it comes back for three more years. There is no medication I can take to help it stay away. Maybe the scars remind me of that fact.

I am putting the burn cream on it. I have two more boosts to go and I am all done!!!! Today I had an ultra sound on the liver. Maybe by Monday I'll have the results. I'll bug them tomorrow for any results.",

He called the center where they did the MRI and had the results faxed to him.He said not to worry its most likely a hemangioma and to have them watch it. The cancer center finally called about a half hour later and wants this study done. At this point I cannot tolerate any more tests and waiting for the results. I feel like I am going out of my mind. I don't think the Physician's Assistant appreciated my decision. He tried to scare me into doing it. I stood up for myself.",

I have stitches on the inside of the incision, glue on top of that and tape. Best part of all... I have been DE-PORTED!!!!! The port is out!!! When I woke up the first thing I did was put my hand there to see if I could feel it. It was gone!!! They have to send it to another hospital to check it out for some reason and then they are going to send it back to me. I am going to smash it, burn it, and then burn it agin while I dance around the fire. It feels great not having that foreign thing inside of me. Thanks everyone for being here and helping me through all of this. Your comments, prayers and (((((HUGS))))) cheered me through some of the roughest parts. Thank you! Thank you! Thank YOu!",

Now I am stuck with short straight hair. It's my hair. Does anyone who had a lumpectomy get a hard spot on their breast after wearing a bra?  I think its from a lack of lymph nodes to push the fluid out. After a few minutes without the bra it softens. I brough it to the doctor's attention and they aren't alarmed.  Got myself a therapist to get through this adventure and some new antidepressants. I've gone through anxiety,crying spells and now dealing with severe anger. I've started to scream in the car when alone to vent. My mom has diabetes and last week she passed out when she went shopping. My father tried to get her to go tot he hospital and she wouldn't go. He called me and my sister and we went. It is an hour trip for us. I ended up screaming at her and I threatened  her that I was going to take her car home or have my father put the battery in my trunk until she saw the doctor. She finally went. She doesn't eat right and now she knows the consequences. I think that started my anger. Anyway i am still around (on this site) just nothing to post. I check to see if anyone posts here and then get sidetracted on other topics. Miss everyone!",

The surgeon and her nurse assistant looked at it and had me go for an ultrasound. The ultrasound showed what looked to me as a big round hole with little chambers. Turns out that the area that had the cancer was full of liquid. I was taken to a procedure room and they opened up the scar and drained the liquid. They packed it with gauze and left the wound open. My husband has to change the gauze twice a day until it heals. My breast no longer looks purple and fells like a brick. Now since I have an open wound, the radiation has been put on hold. I was told for maybe two months until this heals on its own. I don't have to make up the 4 treatments I already had. I guess that is one good thing. Now I feel like this is never going to come to an end. I had it all figured out when my last radiation treatment would be and I would free at last. I hate these little roadblocks. I'm glad everyone in the procedure room was warm and friendly. I tend to be a big baby when it comes to needles and these things and to be there alone made me more scared. I can't believe I made the 45 minute trip home in one piece.  Time to change the gauze. Talk more later.",

No idea when I start back on the rads. Everyone here will be done and I'll be starting all over.  I believe stress does a lot of harm to us. My family doctor believes that it has brought on the cancer. I don't know whether to believe him or not, but it does make sense to me. I deal with a lot of it. Who knows what brought on the cancer. I don't have a family history of it. Maybe its because I am a female and that's the only reason. Hope everyone is having a great day and keeping warm.  The snow looks beautiful outside.",

I managed to do okay on the chemo and survived it. It wasn't fun but \"doable\". When I went for the PET scan they found nodules on my thyroid. So after radiation they want to take out one of the nodules and see if it is cancer. There is a 95% chance that it is okay. It's that 5% they are worried about. I am not looking forward to another surgery. ",

Its much like  the Cat scan and MRI...same princple. I have had a pet scan a couple months ago. The only thing that lit up was my thyroid. I would personally think if there was a problem with the liver it would have showed up on the pet scan. Plus if the Breast cancer traveled to the liver the chemo would have taken care of it. My family doctor agreed. I have come to my own conclusion about the doctor's at this center... they have become desensitized to the feelings and emotions of their patients. They don't show any compassion to their patients... do this, do that and they expect you to be a robot and jump when told to. When I failed to follow their orders I am treated like a rebel. Out comes the nasty voice and the uncertainty of life. They should experience the same they put us through. Walk the hallway of the hospital in a gown that doesnt fit ( that would be great on their rounds); have a stranger come in and ask to see their private parts; and get scheduled for 5 tests in a single day (watch them glow at night).

I don't believe there is a stress relief program in my area. I really want to get a punching bag to take my frustration out on. I have always had stress in my life. I have a 19 year old sonwho has Asperger's Syndrome that since he was a newborn screamed non stop. As a child he would beat me up. It wasn't until I was DX with breast cancer that he stopped. Now I deal with the stress of all of the treatments and the what if's. In the past I would get ocd with crocheting. I would be so engrossed with it that I could resolve my problems. I have just started that hobby up again. Right now I have a nurse practioner that I talk to on the phone regularly for my depression.I had a social worker but later found out that she was not covered by our insurance. I go out with my friends whenever I can, usually once a week.  I go to two cancer support groups. If I can keep myself busy I am usually better. Its trying to get me started that's the problem. I lack the motivation. Thanks for the peaceful thoughts. Valerie",
