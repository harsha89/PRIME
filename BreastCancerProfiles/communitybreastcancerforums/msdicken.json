I have a lumpectomy scheduled for 1/21/09 along with the removal of sentinel nodes.  I feel like this is just another diagnostic test so that feeling of still not truly \"knowing\" is still there. Additionally, at the urging of friends and family, I am seeing a 2nd surgeon on 1/9/09.  I have been very comfortable and confident with my 1st dr. but I know this second look will give me that peace of mind.  Hope that things went well at your appointment too!  My thoughts are with you",
