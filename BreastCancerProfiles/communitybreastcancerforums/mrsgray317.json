The TRAM portion of the program has not been easy.  I had 4 surgeries in 5 weeks- one to ligate the vessels that would feed the flap, the big surgery, one to clean out an infection in my breast and the last for a small skin graft on each breast.  I do have a scar that runs from hip to hip, but I got a tummy tuck for my efforts.  My new breasts don't look a whole lot different than my old ones (smaller, by choice).  I am very happy that I had this done.  I now have a 1% chance of developing BC- down from >50% (on paper, probably more like 80% in reality).  I do not have to take tamox-yeah! It sounds like you are not completely at ease with what your doc is saying-get another opinion and another until you feel like what you are hearing makes sense to you. All the Best, Patti",
