I have the same pain and tenderness (turned up out of nowhere two days ago) but also have nipple discharge (I noticed that before the pain, haven't breastfed in 3 years but let it go until the pain came). Went to doc who took a culture, felt around and was sure it was my duct but not 100%. I've had blood work and have an ultrasound and mammogram on monday. Next month I'll have a CT scan to look at my pituitary gland. Nervous and scared but almost relieved to hear someone else is experiencing the same thing at the same time. Don't know if you'll read this anytime soon but sending my prayer so your way.",
