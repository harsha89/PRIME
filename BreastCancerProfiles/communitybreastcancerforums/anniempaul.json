I'm looking for a woman in her 40s who has received a false-positive mammogram result--that is, she got a mammogram that indicated that she might have cancer, but then it turned out that she didn't. (I've already spoken to a number of women whose early-stage cancer was in fact caught by a routine mammogram screen.) If you've had such an experience and would be willing to talk to me about it, please email me at anniempaul@gmail.com. Best, Annie Murphy PaulÂ  Log in to post a reply",
