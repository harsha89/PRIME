    "Content": "snowing wrote: I am 1 week post-op and am wondering what to buy for  wearing after the post surgery camisole.  This site talks about temporary prostheses.  Are these just lighter than regular ones or according to the blogs, are they \"home made\"?  At what point  do you buy a regular prothesis and mastectomy bras?  Is it common to have a number of protheses - for water sports, everyday wear etc. etc.  When do you need a custom prothesis?  It looks like it is very expensive but in my case, I've had a lumpectomy on one side and a mastectomy on the other so maybe I have to consider it .  Any suggestions would be appreciated as this is a new road for me to follow.
