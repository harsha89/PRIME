I am 37 years old & am not sure what the treatment protocol is for my age, my cancer & my onco score. I meet with my oncologist for the first time next Tuesday, 8.2.11. I'm going INSANE waiting, waiting, waiting... Does anyone else have similar diagnosis & age? If so, what did your onc recommend after oncotype? chemo + radiation + Tamoxifen? or.. just radiation & tamoxifen?? thanks in advance. :)",

Much easier to get on & off after surgery. Plus, it's nice to have the open arms for your lymph node incision under your arm.  I have very small breasts (A cup), so the sports bras with front closures I bought caused me more pain & discomfort than they helped. That's probably different for everyone. For me, I felt like a 200-pound man was standing on my chest for a few days after my lumpectomy. My incision is on the inside of my chest, so that's probably why...   I always wear/bring warm fuzzy socks when I'm at a hospital, because they're always so cold.  That's all I can think of. I assume you have someone to drive you home, right? ",

I chimed in on this thread & in this forum because of the discussion about Andrea Mitchell's announcement that she has breast cancer. You all were upset at her misuse of statistics and misstatement of facts surrounding this disease, implying - or stating - there is a cure. I wanted to share that it is not only Andrea Mitchell who is annoucing to the world that BC is curable - it is also people like my oncologist. She told me that I was, for all intents & purposes, cured after my surgery which happened to occur 7 days after I found out I had cancer. That's it. If you want to change the way people understand this disease or how they share information about it, it should probably begin with the medical profession who seem to be selling their own version of facts to their patients. I wasn't trying to educate anyone and I would NEVER come in here to brag. That's ridiculous.   For the record, I am NOT a member of the pink parade. I hated pink before I ever thought about BC. Now, I'm forced to be a member of a club I didn't ask to join & feel guilty for not being a pink ribbon cheerleader. If it were up to me, ALL monies raised from pink ribbons & the like would be distributed toward research vs luncheons, t-shirts or even awareness campaigns. Pink ribbons won't find a cure. Only research will. With any luck, I will raise enough money for my local Komen chapter this year that they'll get to know me & I can join their board so that I can then affect change and direct their future funding toward increased research. That's the best I can do.  My heart breaks for each of you, imagining your pain and the sadness of those who love you.  May your days on this earth be many and may they be filled with true happiness, peace and love. Blessings and love to you. ~Shevawn",

I didn't come here to brag that I had been cured! What kind of horrible person would consider doing such a thing!?? You all started a thread, discussing the words used by Andrea Mitchell in describing breast cancer & I was letting you all know what my doctor told me. Period. If it's NOT possible to be cured, I would like to know. If my oncologist is feeding me a bunch of crap, I want to know. I wasn't arguing any kind of point, so there's no way I could have been \"wrong\" or \"right\" on this one - as I was accused. I was simply stating information as I had received it. Despite being \"cured\" by surgery, I still chose to do chemo, will start my 33 rounds of radiation next month, followed by 5-years of tamoxifen. I know the difference in a local & a distant recurrence and I know what mets are. Just because I had \"only\" Stage I cancer, doesn't make my cancer any less real or any less scary and it doesn't mean that I didn't worry about dying too. I educated myself with every book I could find at my local library because I wanted to know EVERY possibility - for my treatment now and for whatever my future may hold. If my cancer comes back, I want to be prepared. Again, I'm sorry I was misunderstood and caused such a raucous. I do find it sad that my words have been so misconstrued and I am left feeling like I'm less worthy because I was lucky to have found my lump before it spread, got treatment quickly and \"only\" had Stage I.",

That's pretty remarkable, right?!? She also told me that breast cancer can be considered cured after it's treated - the first time you have it. (or, in the rare instance of a second, completely different cancer) However, once it recurs, it will likely kill you and it is becomes impossible to cure. At that point, you can only manage the disease, like diabetes.   I understand the aversion to words like \"cure,\" but I am equally averse to scaring women to death & letting them think that breast cancer is a death sentence, because it's clearly not anymore. Lots of women avoid screenings because they're afraid of being told they have cancer, which they think means they're going to lose their hair, puke all the time & die a horrible, painful death. If we can portray an accurate picture of BC treatment, that's not all pink ribbons & rainbows nor is it death & suffering, we'll all be better for it. ",

I go back Aug 24th for round 2 of 4. As of today - 13 days in, I haven't felt anything that would warn me I'm about to lose my hair. I already purchased a halo and a full wig is on order, but I'm wondering WHEN will I lose my hair??? The waiting is so hard. It's making me crazy. I'm grateful to still have hair, but I can't help wonder if I'm going to be one of the \"lucky ones\" who doesn't lose her hair. Is this even possible?? I can't find anything about such online anywhere!!   Thanks all & best of luck to everyone! ",
