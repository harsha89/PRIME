I had a lumpectomy on 3/15 and did not get any clean margins, lobular was discovered along with the ductal they went in for and they took 4 nodes and all 4 were positive. I had a bmx on 4/11, but prior to the bmx my MO ordered the oncotype dx. His guess was that it was going to come back somewhere in the middle. I found out 2 days ago that even with the positive nodes (17/17 with the bmx) that my score was a 6. Prior to the results his plan was chemo and some chemo trials. Now I am not sure what the plan will be with a score of 6 because the nodes had the same cancer as the breast tissue and it appears chemo is of little or no benefit. I don't want to do chemo for the hell of it, yet I don't know what I should do.",

My hair dresser got me the whole nioxin kit to start prio to chemo and told me to still use it to clean the chemo from the pours. He also got me a bottle of Nioxin supplement tablets to start taking after chemo. That won't be until mid October though. I took losing my hair worse than losing my boobs. No one can tell I have a wig on except the people who know me, so I guess that's a good thing. I still have about 20% of my hair left and can't bring myself to shave it.

After you wash it put it on the head and brush it with a round brush and brush it under while you steam it. I clip it up in sections. The steam won't hurt your wig. After that you can let it air dry or if yours is heat resistant you can dry it with a blow dryer on low and then curl with a curling iron no higher than medium. They do tend to get frizzy, but the steam will make it soft and silky again.",

I didn't get real hair because that was 1500.00, but I did get a heat resistant one so I can use a curling iron on it and have some curls. I am getting used to wearing it now. It's weird, but when the time comes it will be hard to stop wearing it. It is some sort of security blanket for me. I figure I will be wearing it until next spring because I don't stop chemo until the end of October. Winters are cold here in Maine so I won't be taking it off until warm weather. It seems like once you get over a hurdle another one replaces it. When I stop chemo and start rads they have to deflate my left boob until after rads. That will depress me for sure. My PS said to come see her the last day of rads and she will fill it back up. It's all crazy stuff to have to deal with.",

It just seemed to big. I have made them out of knit and felt that has a little stretch to it. I found some fabric for 1.00 a yard so I could get a least 2-3 hats for under a dollar and took no time to make.

I told them before we went in that we weren't going to get drinks as we'd be home ten minutes after and they would just waste them anyways. The cashier kept looking at me in line. I know he was looking at my bald head. After we paid for our tacos he handed us each a cup for a drink. My husband and I laughed and said we should use the bald card more often.",

Hats work right now. It is difficult for all of us to be bald and we can grieve the loss but for me just feeling good enough to enjoy the little things is so important as o haven't been able to do that in so long. I don't go out in public with this bald head but not because I am embarrassed or ashamed. I don't want to be stared at or have anyone ask questions. I had a meltdown the day my hair started falling out. Couldn't believe it was happening again. I don't feel feminine without my hair. I try not to look in the mirror. I just chose not to let it rob me of doing things as for me time is limited. By all means grieve. I have my days too where I am so tired of it too. I wish I had tried the cold caps sometimes.

I know I am at a higher risk, but I am doing the treatments that are available and pray for the best. I missed the Metformin trial by 1 day and he would not prescribe it to me. He did however call my primary and discussed it with her and she wrote the script for me. She said it was a fairly safe drug and although she said she could not tell me it would work but said it can't hurt to try. Have a great weekend and thanks for being here for all of us with our questions and fears. Hugs to you...... Diana",

Now we have the results back she took me off the A/c because it was not in the list to likely to work. Taxol was on it so I am staying it. Makes you wonder how many are on chemos that aren't even going to do anything but have horrible side effects. There are other chemos I can do that are on the most likely to work list but we are saving them to use down the road if needed. The Taxol is working because I can eat again after about 4 months of a liquid diet and after three roounds my tumor marker went from 198-162 👍. The test are very expensive but the company has financial aid and I don't have to pay for anything above what my insurance pays. They also tested my cancer against drugs that have not been FDA approved yet. So many choices and if needed she said she would create a clinical trial for me.

Chemo kills cancer when it is dividing so the lower the grade the harder it is to kill the little bastards as they are not dividing quickly. When they divide they shed a protein in our blood. That is how they do the tumor marker test. My tumor marker was tested again and went down 30 points. I had finished 6 rounds of chemo and stated at 205 and now down to 132. Finished round 7 of 12 yesterday and worried by the time I finish the 12th it will still be around 100 and the norm is either 36 or 38 so not sure if she will have me stop or do a few more rounds. All my other blood work was normal which is a total miracle considering 2 months ago they didn't think I was going to live through the weekend. Does your doctor do the tumor marker test for you? I would request he does if he doesn't already. Hang in there",

My surgeon order all my mammograms from many yrs ago and compared them. She said that when you look at all of them in a row for many yrs she could see the tissue getting denser each yr. When I had my mammograms they compared it to the previous yr so the changes were not that noticable. I did notice that breast had become heavier, but I thought it was a combination of age and gravity. Most of my cancer was microscopic, it is just that there was so much of it. I am glad now that I had the bmx and am doing the chemo incase the little shits went undected somewhere else. My new boobs are much better than the old ones and they are just with the TE's at this point. Will do the exchange in April or May next yr. I still have wonderful radiation to do after chemo.

When they radiated my chest wall I got blustered on my back and had to use burn cream. I had it in 2004 on the right side and in 2013 on the left. Skin burns and being tired are the two side effects. I wish you ladies would ask for the chemo sensitivity testing to make sure you are on the right chemos. After two rounds of the A/C I was glad to get off it as we know know it's not a benefit. It pisses me off how many docs still guess at this when there are ways to know without putting you through hell and itsnot even going to help. Have a great day ladies",

Haven't had to take any nausea pills just some gas-x in the morning. If anyone gets this odor issue and finds something that works please let me know. Hugs Dian",

Infusion time is so quick compared to all three. About an hour for pre-Med's then an hour for the Taxol and you are out of there. All kinds of energy that day and the next from the steroids so we try to plan on doing things during that time because I know the next day is crash day but not too bad. Has anyone had their tumor markers done to see how effective the treatments are yet? I started at 195 and a couple of weeks ago was down to 162 so we know it's working.

You need to hurry up girl. I was 51 years old, how old are you? Are you having radiation after chemo? When I had my tissue expanders out and had the permanent implants in I had them take my ovaries at the same time. Figured I was already under and it would be one place the little cancer bastards wouldn't be able to go to but I was too late. The cancer was already in one ovary yet never showed on any of the scans. Something to think about. Then you have choices of which drug to be on. I find that when I feel sick as much as I don't feel like eating I force myself and it does help. I have never taken a nausea drug. The big C is scary as Ihad a blockage in October that about killed me and had my stomach pumped for over two days. Horrible experience.

I did two weeks in a row of A/C plus the Taxol at the same time. Then the sensitivity test showed the A/C was not a benefit. I think I am struggling mentally because I don't know what the plan is after I finish the Taxol which should be around 2/8. Whatever the plan is I am praying that it is something that lets my hair grow back. Tired of the whole bald thing! The new nausea shot has been such a blessing! As much as the shot hurts I want it again this week. I am actually starting to put weight back on. In June I was 134 and got downto 110 and now up to 118 😁. I will be happy to get to 125.

One week my blood work was fine then it all went crazy. Liver was failing, platelets dropped to 37, I was yellow as can be. All my red counts were crazy and my heart rate was around 130 most of the time. Blood vessels in my eyes were exploding and I was too weak to walk or talk. MO said we didn't have time to do an echocardiogram but wanted to give me A/C and Taxol to see if we could try to turn things around. She said I probably would not make it through the weekend. I agreed to do it as it was my only hope. I also got the first of five transactions. I think she was shocked when I showed up on Monday. It took several weeks but slowly things started to get better. I must say being that close to death was a strange experience. I wasn't prepared at all. I didn't feel afraid but instead I felt more sadness then I had ever felt. I didn't want to leave my family. I love my life and the people in it. So many people we're praying and I strongly feel God pulled me through because I didn't have the strength to fight. Four weeks ago my blood started to get all crazy again and MO put me back on a weekly dose of A/C and things are getting back to good again. Liver is back to normal. She feels the cancer just keeps getting ahead of us. If platelets and other things look ok on Thursday I will start Ibrance. I will pray that the chemo turns things around for you as it is for me. I know your fears too well. Hugs.... Dian",

I would ask your oncologist. I totally hate wigs. They hurt after awhile. If you search headbands with hair there are some you can wear with a hat or full hair attached tothe headband. I prefer these. They are inexpensive too",

It's similar drug but long lasting. Has made a world of difference. The shot itself really sucks. It's very thick and the nurse has to heat it up first and because of the thickness it's a very large ass needle and goes in slow. But it has been well worth it! Apparently it's expensive too because they waited for insurance approval first. They offered me two weeks off but chose the shot and to comein on Sunday for fluids. With 4 more to go o just want to get it done",

Hubby got me a new violin 🎻 and start lessons on Monday. Hoping it helps with my stress and doesn't create more. I see the MO tomorrow before chemo and really need to know the plan when I finish next month. I have not had any scans since before chemo so I am sure she will order one. I really hate the contrast !!!! Does anyone have a plan of action for after chemo",

I had my ovaries out at the same time they exchanged the expander for the implants. One stop shopping. Plastic surgeon did the exchange then surgeon did the ovaries. The exchange was painless but was pretty sore from the ovaries being taken out.",

I didn't have a recliner and had to prop up lots of pillows and would wake up constantly feeling like I was falling. Once the dam drain tubes are out sleeping in the bed is great. I was lucky to only have them for 6 days as others were over a month. Hoping you don't have to keep them long 👍",
