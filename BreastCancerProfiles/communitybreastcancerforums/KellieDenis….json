My left nipple (cancer side) looks great. Right side is very black, purple, and scabby. Doctors originally had that yellow zero form gauze on it but since my last visit with my ps 6 days ago, a dry gauze was placed. I was told to keep it clean, and dry. Both PS, and BS are holding out hope, and feel I may just have some superficial loss that will probably manifest itself as some scaring, which can be dealt with by adding pigmenting tattoo should I choose. I'm hanging tight, its hard to believe that this is hopeful, but many others have shared their similar stories so I'm gonna keep cheering \"righty\" on. I think I shared on another thread that my 11 yr old daughter walked in while my husband was changing my dressing, and began serenading my nipple to the tune of the bee gees \"staying alive, stayin alive\"!!! We are a little silly around our house. Gets us through the crazy times though. No regrets, even if I lose the nipple. Promised that I'm DONE beating myself up. No second guessing, learning to let go a little, and love myself. Anniealso, big healing wishes, what an ordeal you've been through. Pls keep us posted.",

I'm so sorry you're having to deal with this junk on top of everything else that comes along with BC. Its like one last kick in the teeth! I greatly appreciate the link Binney4. I will definitely follow through. In fact I had significant lymph node discomfort/swelling and breast pain from my stereotactic biopsy alone. I had to ice it, and take Tylenol for pain. It was so annoying, and lasted almost the entire time in between the time of biopsy to my BMX, just shy of 2 months. An early MRI identified a large hematoma from the biopsy, and what appeared to be an enlarged node. When the radiologist blew it up it was actually just a cluster of 3 nodes. At my SN mapping the uptake appeared the same way. The BS said its called a \"fake out\" which is once again not one large node but a cluster together. My SN was clear but this brings us right back to what Ginger was getting at, we are all have our own risk level uniquie to our bodies. My final path report on my cancerous side even reported the presence of that original hematoma from my stereotactic biopsy. I'm sure my lymph system was working overtime to heal that mess. Throw in a BMX, can't imagine! I'm almost 4 weeks post op, I can still feel a cording, and a string of small nodes. Anyone know how long that usually lasts after surgery. Thanks again girls, you are so informed, and very proactive. I'm so grateful for your support, and advice!",

I had a very difficult to diagnose dvt after a long flight 10 yrs ago. It was a nightmare, had an enormous medical work up, lasting yrs, including exploratory surgery to figure out why my leg was big and swollen. One of the theories for awhile was primary lymphedema, (a genetic predisposition to LE). A lymphoscintigram eventually ruled that out. The only test I didn't have was an angiogram which I now know is the most definitive test for lower extremity blood clots that are sometimes hard to locate with a Doppler study alone. Long story short this unresolved clot left me with symptoms very similar to lymphedema. Residual swelling, and nerve pain. The swelling is effected by weather, altitude, and activity. I always wear compression stockings when flying, and even then my leg still fills up. Humidity for some reason increases swelling as well. When I found out a node biopsy was required with my BMX I became very concerned. All too aware how debilitating LE could become. My BS agreed to ordere a baseline bio impedance test prior to surgery, and has suggested repeating it in a couple of months. Did any of you ladies have that test? I hadn't heard of it prior to last month. From my understanding it can identify lymphedema prior to what otherwise would only be clinical findings? Thanks for starting this thread! I agree with you gals. Take as many precautions as you can. My BS mentioned the blood draws and BP concerns related to LE were unfounded. I didn't care, I still asked to have all my post op BP vitals done on my legs, and had the IV on my other arm. Nurses were very cool about it too, but even if they weren't tough cookies, its my body. Who wants the risk!",
