After a recent death in the family I found out that I have 2 first cousins who have had mastectomies and numerous women on my grandmothers {Paternal} side of the family.  Does this new info matter.  I ask because they only seem to be interested in parents and siblings. I am currently taking tamoxifen and doing just ok with it. Thanks in advance.   Peace to all. stefie",
