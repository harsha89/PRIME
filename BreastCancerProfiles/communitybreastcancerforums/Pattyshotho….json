My surgery is scheduled for July 24th.  I go in Monday to consult about what exactly he will be doing.  I have no idea.  so, the nurse say's its an excisional biopsy since they couldn't do any other  biopsy with the radiologist doctor??  IDK.  They say I'll be under anestesia again, I just had 2 spine surgeries, and I will leave the same day.  Does excisional biopsy mean that I possibly have to go back in for another surgery?  I just want this done and over with. How long should I expect to wait to make sure it's not the c word?  here's the thing, The doctor is going on vacation the next week. So, I go in on Thursday and I'm pretty sure his last day before his vacation is Friday.  What if something goes bad while he's on vacation? I know if I was a doctor I'd be taking long vacations. If they could have just done the normal biopsy like everyone else gets my mind would be at ease. ",
