When I returned with my second recurrance over 20 years later I was pleasantly surprised to see alot of the same staff and nurses still there and this gave me a feeling of reassurance.  They knew me well and I knew them and I felt a continuity, if that is the right word.  I have bonded with a few of them over the years and there is not a negative word I could say about any of the staff in that hospital.  They are caring, they listen, they are patient, they give you all the time you need from them, they pull strings to get you the right treatment, and they put up with my tantrums, what else could one want. I have just finished my dreaded first course of chemo and thanks to the nurses at the chemo unit they have made the experience alot more bearable than I thought it could be.  They always had a smile on their faces when they greeted me, they were gentle putting in canulas and administering chemo, they chatted away to distract from what was going on and helped to relax me.  There was also free sandwiches and snacks and drinks for anyone having chemo and tv/radio/internet screens by each chair.  And as awful as the ordeal of chemo was these little things all helped in small ways with me getting through my chemo days. I will probably be under the Royal Marsden now for the rest of my life and I honestly would not want to be in any other hands.  This is a terrible disease and ordeal for anyone to have to go through but I also like to look for the small blessings and help that come along the way and without which I could not make the journey.  All the best.

All of the physical symptoms of my advanced bc in both breasts have gone and the breasts are soft and floppy again, good skin texture and mostly all the orange peel is gone, good color, swellings and lymphodema gone.  But two weeks ago I noticed something on the original breast.  Two years ago I developed what looks like a crease or seam on the breast starting at the nipple and going right to the end of the breast, very strange.  Even my doctor said she had never seen that before.  Now two weeks ago there is a bit of skin that looks bunched up right in the center of this seam and feels hard to the touch.  It is worrying me silly especially having just finished chemo.  It is oval, smooth, with round edges, almost little finger shaped.  The doctor says she is not overly concerned considering the cancer will likely not completely go anymore and I will just stay on treatments now.  She thinks it could be a deposit of some kind or something that was there before the chemo but could not be felt because of swelling and fluid.  The bottom half of that breast is virtually non existant now, having flattened against itself so much since the last recurrance.  You don't even need to feel this little \"finger shaped\" thing because you can see with the eye the bunched up skin.  I am having another ultrasound this week because not alot could be seen before chemo due to the oedema and thickening and also having a biopsy to the second breast.  Everytime I go to sleep I have bad dreams that either someone is telling me I am dying or I am telling someone I am dying and I see blood dripping down my legs and feet but for some reason I have 4 legs and 4 feet.  I am slowly going crazy.
