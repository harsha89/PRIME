It is much less so now (as you can see I have just passed the 3 year mark :), but I still get caught, again when carrying groceries and in the node area particulary when I am doing yoga and am in a position where my arms are overhead in a stretch.  I can now comfortably lean on the area when sleeping, it did take a long time though.

If you do not feel well, you could go to the Hawaii plan, but have your friends and family come to your area for 2 weeks each in order to help you out.  The Dr. component is a large part of your care as mentioned.  Also, would your insuance cover your care if you temporally moved to another area? More food for thought :)  Best wishes",

I recently celebrated 9 years cancer free at the beginning of September, just before my annual mammogram, I began to have pain on (what seemed to be) a rib on the right side, same side as my original IDC stage 1 in 2009. I reported it when I checked in for my mammogram, and they changed the billing code to a diagnostic mammogram rather than a routine yearly screening. The mammogram was normal, but I was told I should have an MRI under the circumstances. The MRI was also normal. I saw my oncologist today who ordered a bone scan, after determining for certain that the pain was on a rib, not my breast. I asked her if I should be worried, and she said \"maybe a little\". I asked her if she knew the chance of recurrence for those who were stage 1 with negative nodes. Right off the bat, she said 2%, and laughed because she said she only knew because she is currently writing a paper... After that, she spoke openly and honestly with me about what if it turns out that I have bone mets. She said there is a specific type of bone met with BC, which involves only one location, and even though you are considered stage 4 at that point, that it is completely curable. Of course if there are more spots, thats a different story...I haven't shared any of this with anyone. I have been divorced for just over 4 years, and don't want to concern anyone in my family prematurely. I am concerned, not overly worried, but that's why I'm here...Anyone with a similar story or situation?",

Medigal- sorry for everything you have had to suffer through.  As if the big C isn't bad enough... ",

In addition to being a worrier, I had had a very stressful year+ prior to my diagnosis.  Best wishes.  Wendy ",
