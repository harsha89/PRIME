I had a biopsy in 08.   I was told it was just a cyst.  Having no other info, I came here.  I asked my Doc for more info and was flatly put down and told I have an anxiety disorder-take some drugs.  I refused.  I ran with it and had no one to talk to about things. A year later my retired Doc set me up with a BS and I spoke with her thinking it was a cyst.  She did not correct me nor inform me of the difference.  I stayed here to learn and realize just how much emotional effort this should occupy of my life.  She also sent me to a new radiology office where information as of June 09 at least is detailed. I guess along the way the lie or the brush off has effected me more and more.  Benign is benign but the difference is important to me.  A cyst - we've read about those.  A benign lipoma is a tumor.  So I say Hurray. I had a battery of tests done about 3 months ago - bone density, blood and heart, more chest xrays.  I went back to complain that my RB was really hurting and because of the tests she put me on really strong antibiotics. Said I had a low grade fever - where, I don't know.  That was three months ago and the pain only stopped about 3 weeks ago.  I asked if I could work through the pain as my job is physical, and yes I could. Easier said than done. Somehow, I since my June mam/us, I have become very aggitated.  The report itself had typo's and they at that office said no, I was given the correct one and their's doesn't have any typo's.  I don't want to ask my Doctor for a revised one, as she is not verbally helpful.  So I let it go.  That probably is contributing.  Had to go back for more results, and she said I was fine.  I exhaled and asked no questions and she said I needed to go on the antidepressants she has said I need for the last 2 years.  Since that appt  I have lost it 3 times but last week I was like watching someone else.  I was hysterical all night and I have not slept in a week and a half more than 3 hours a day.  So I vented here, made the appointment and am going on those drugs. I have the appt this afternoon.  I have an appt at work because I have been so unreliable since June.  I don't want to discuss this with them.  ",

When I had the mamo, the girl said to ask the radiologist for answers while I was there, instead of waiting. He recommended the MRI.  But, the other doctor who needle biopsied, then cut me, 3 weeks later, took out a lump I found, along with 2 others - that was back in October.  She said there were more there, but the freezing was wearing off, as I knew, while she stitched me back up. That was my 1 o'clock site.  But because she cut first, they were mad about not knowing where it grew from exactly.  It was as big as a marble, and upon taking it out, she said she knew ThaT one was a cyst. They were all sent for testing, and that's the info I forgot, and am going back to get, again, as the cyst was B9, as they are.  Don't remember what the other two were.  As for 7 and 9, that showed up in the mamo and the us, and that's what they're looking at, on me, AND, as well, because she cut, they have to wait for the scarring and tissue to heal, ONE year, and then they wait 6 months for new imaging.  That puts me off until December, or the new year. I trust my Doctor, but, as others have said, they don't want us going off the deep end in stress, which also doesn't help.   So, I'm along for the ride with you.",

I wish I knew if they would do something immediately because I am so distracted from everything from waiting and waiting. I don't like to be on hold.  I had a thermography scan, T3 again, that something was up, high, in my LB, and it makes me wonder if something is up.  I should have stopped 'hurting' since the January antibiotics.   (When I was in with my GP she said I was taking things very well.  I said, when I get home, can I have a beer?  YYYEEESSS.  It was good.) I just don't want to hear wait, what 3 or 6 months.  Geeeeeessszzzzzzz.",

And how if, the scar is right beside the nipple at about 3 o'clock (!!!!!!!) can they say something at 11 o'clock is post surgical?   Somebody tell me to stop it.",

Don't for a minute think I wasn't looking over my shoulder when I couldn't give my Daughter the things we needed.  I did our life honestly.  Still have some agency able to walk in and shame you for any situation  She has already told me and told me that it is okay because that is the biggest guilt I have ever felt. That lady's jerk gets to walk away from her and hide.  He forgets that some day the kids will figure out what he did.  ",

They live away from Tokyo and the 6 hit in their town (Yokohama) and with the fallout, they're out of there... except for the parents.

LEAF - I found out that what is active is the original Autom-immune Disorder that CAUSED the thyroid problems, is at work.  I just thought I'd mention that thyroid issues can be a secondary cause - this I was told to by the Hemotologist.  I didn't realize you also had thyroid issues way back.  I tested positive for something that is an auto-immune disorder first. I am glad everyone seems to be allowed to discuss other matters that worry us - any systemic problem that can be either ruled out or addressed as something to worry about.  Somebody really made me feel we were zoning out over nothing. I'm still not getting any information and brushed off regarding any questions I have over the lumpies I have, but am to be staying on 6 month ultrasounds and 1 year mammos. Go figure.  ",

Left a message at the med center he is at now, but, no answer.  Doing Diabetes research instead. When I called here to say that I did not have time to get a referral from him for another Doctor, before he left, and that the reason I was looking for him was because of a possibility of breast cancer, the receptionist just repeated that he had moved.  NOT one bit of concern about what I had just said about me. So I repeated it and asked if there was any way of reaching him; no.  She didn't even ask me who I was nor consider asking if there was anything They could do.   So, my Husband remembered his childhood friend's sister is in cancer research here, somewhere, so we put a call in to her, but no reply yet.  I can't even find the Doctor who did the biopsy. So all this waiting has had me thinking about something else.  I don't understand the estrogen connection yet, other than it is bad to have too much.  Well, it is classified as a sex hormone, so why is this bad?????????????? Is this where like men we can't have too much of it because, in men's cases, they might have a heart attack?  And us, our boobs blow up?  Sorry not tonight Dear. Keep that pin away from me! Estrogen, Estrogen. My neighbour's house caught on fire yesterday, 2 houses down.  The back half of the house is a writeoff.  Pretty scary.  But it had me thinking, if we consider ourselves, isn't this whole thing about the same idea, I mean, how much damage do we sustain before it is under control? A whole team of firefighters, EMS, police, city electrical and natural gas people, the neighbour's - everyone was there.  Everyone there, allowing who is allowed to, to PUT the fire out.  Now, they're dealing with restoration, and insurance and loss prevention.  Yeah, it'll never be the same, but all the friends and consideration.  WOW.  I didn't know so many of my neighbours are home in the afternoon! Yeah, so I guess I'll play with fire for now and roll with the estrogen!",
