Hugs and Prayers, Terry Johnson Suffolk VA",

Stage 3 with 5 cm tumor.  After two surgeries finally have clean margins and clean lymphnodes.  My doctor wants agressive chemo which I see the oncologist this Thursday. Whatever that means. 30 rounds of Radiation after that then permanent emplants if possible for a matching pair.  (the only good news out of this).  I am 45 with 5 children. I work full time and home to work during the chemo and radiation.  I've already bought the coolest wig though... Thanks for  letting me share... Terry J",

Bye for now....Terry J",
