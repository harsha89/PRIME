I started getting pain in different parts of my body in december. It started in my right ankle, but not enough to prevent me from walking. It just hurt to touch it. Last week it moved to my right foot and I it is still there, preventing me from walking correctly. I cannot put full weight on it, so I can't exercise, i can't function! I visited my onc this past tuesday and he is saying there is no such pain from tamoxifen! He suggested that i can switch to arimidex but that joint pain is known with that drug. if I am having with pain with tamoxifen and I shouldn't , then I think I will not have it with the other. Just wondering how you are doing on the other drug.",

If I had my running shoes on, they would rub against the spot where my ankle hurt. I didn't think too much about it, just thought maybe I did something! Anyway, it isn't in my left ankle anymore, it moved to my right foot. I can't stand flat on my foot without a shooting pain up my leg. Went to oncologist tuesday of this week, and they basically told me I am nuts, tamoxifen doesn't cause nerve pain. I am going to try taking Glucosamine - I saw it mentioned in another thread from a few years ago. I have to do something, this is ridiculous! Especially the fact that my onc says there is no way the tamox should be causing joint pain. I guess I will have to show him all the threads about it here :) ",
