So what is the discoloration about? why is my nipple so extremely sensitive and sore? Thanks for the information, and it sounds like you really care for your patients. Most of my treatment team have been just wonderful, thank goodness.",

I start estrogen blockers in a few weeks. I am told my prognosis is quite good. I thought by now I'd be feeling out of the woods. I can understand the 2-month anxiety attack prior to the surgery, I just can't figure out why I am still so angry, anxious and depressed.",

      "Content": "Mar 7, 2018 06:26PM LizzieP123 wrote: I am dealing with breast cancer. However, I want to tell you about something else -- my nearly perfect husband was killed in a crash when I was 52. I absolutely could not imagine life without him and didn't want to go on living. Went mad for a couple of years and finally pulled out with the help of antidepressants. Didn't think I could ever love again, but I did and remarried. Now I love two men: one dead, one alive. My position on this is if I die first I know he will be so hurt and lonely, I hope he finds another lady to love. He would just shrivel up if he had to live alone. Cancer puts us on such an intensely personal cruel emotional roller coaster -- terror, anger, depression, crazy, etc. It's hard to think beyond our own hurt. I just imagine him living alone, lost, sad, not eating well, not laughing, not having any fun, feeling unloved, and it comes clear when I have gone I want some nice lady to love him.",
