I was terrified when diagnosed and kept having flashbacks to when my mother was dying and I was convinced it was going to happen to me too. I feel a lot better now - my mom's was in her lymph nodes when diagnosed, mine is not.   Would I do the same thing again? Probably, and there is peace of mind from having both of them removed, but there are days when I do sort of wish I'd only done the uni-mx and kept the other side on high surveillance and tamoxifen (which would have reduced the chances of contralateral recurrence).  And I can only imagine that I'd have similar thoughts if I'd done something completely prophylactic -- though if I had decided to do something at age 36 when I was done nursing kid #2, I suspect that the lump was already there and would have been found at mx.  I do regret not insisting on getting an MRI at age 36 once I'd finished nursing, as it might have been visible then and I could have had a lumpectomy. Mammograms and ultrasounds failed me in early detection. I'm nearly certain the MRI would have found it a little earlier. I was lucky in some respects as my lymph nodes were negative, I had a low oncotype, and I've avoided chemo.  I would strongly consider getting an MRI before you decide on surgery - for two reasons ... 1) If there is anything there, you can make plans for looking at your nodes, get an idea of the grade and other tumor characteristics, and 2) There might be nothing there.... which might affect your decision process.  There are two outcomes for the \"nothing there\" 1) There are things that pop up on the MRI but are benign on biopsy and 2) Nothing really is there. ",

I had a bilateral mx in November without reconstruction. My husband is fully supportive (and actually I think was more horrified than me at the prospect of implants or the surgery to do a flap -- I'm too thin for a DIEP and wasn't thrilled at the prospect of that surgery and the damage elsewhere) I'm happy so far being flat. I wasn't huge to begin with (small B) and I'm thin, so it's not a huge change. I'm completely flat at the moment due to rads and damaged skin, but I was able to wear a bra and prosthesis in the interim between surgery and rads, and while it wasn't comfortable, it wasn't much more uncomfortable than a real bra is, and I don't have my fancy protheses yet.  I've gotten some \"you can always reconstruct later\" comments from friends and family, who were a little surprised when I didn't - - and it's true - I can change my mind in the future. Although cosmetically best to do it when doing the BMX - esp if they can spare your nipple on your unaffected side, the road isn't closed if you later decide you want recon. Best of luck -- ",

You're probably negative. I can share my story, which is similar to yours. My mom was dx in her mid 40s (in the 1980s) and died about 8 years later  in her early 50s of metastatic breast cancer (well, congestive heart failure probably from the adriamycin, but she had mets in her bones). Her mother (my grandmother) and and sisters (two of my aunts) were fine and all lived / have lived into their late 80s (one aunt is still around at age 87). However, my mother had a first cousin on her father's side who also had premenopausal BC and died from it. And, there is also a lot of cancer on my father's side too - dad died of lung cancer in his 50s, and his sister died of \"stomach\" cancer in her 60s, though we suspect this might have been metastatic BC, as she'd had a lumpectomy in her early 40s. I have no sisters. My gynecologist and PCP thought I had a moderate familial risk, but thought I was probably BRCA negative. I have very few other risk factors - except not having kids until I was 30 (though I tallied up a total of 3 yrs of breastfeeding between the two kids). My ob/gyn started my mammogram screenings at age 35. I was scheduled for my first MRI when my gyn felt the lump at my annual check up (at age 41). My mammograms had been clear (and the diagnostic mammogram that was taken after the lump was felt was also clear), and the lump really only showed on MRI.  Long story short: I had the lump biopsied, it came back as invasive lobular. During the wait between diagnosis and surgery I had the BRCA test done to evaluate my risk and help decide surgical options. It came back negative, which didn't really surprise me. My surgeon said what many of the other comments have said - that there are genetic variants out there that haven't been discovered, but that it doesn't mean it's not hereditary (direct genetic, or possibly epigenetic factors - my mom was the youngest in her family by a decade - - a menopause baby - born when my grandmother was 46).  It was suggested that due to my young age (younger than when my mom had been diagnosed), the type of cancer (lobular has a slightly higher chance of contralateral) and my family history, that my risk of eventually developing cancer in the other side (which appeared healthy on the MRI) was about 15-20% lifetime (if I live another 40 years, which I certainly plan to!). It was a tough decision, but I went with the prophylactic on my healthy side, and mostly do not regret it, as I didn't think I could stand the screenings (two spots that showed on the MRI might have needed biopsy) or live with myself if it ever came back on the other side and I hadn't taken the opportunity now (and I didn't have to have my lymph nodes disturbed on that side).  What I do know is that I would NOT have done a prophylactic mastectomy prior to diagnosis - especially now knowing I am BRCA negative -- even given the knowledge I now have. That may seem like a crazy statement, but cancer is a crapshoot, and a mastectomy is a major, life changing surgery, and from what I've read and heard from friends, reconstruction is not a piece of cake (I haven't had recon, and my recovery has been pretty easy). I'm not saying definitely don't do the prophylactic surgery - you should think about it and come to a conclusion you're comfortable with, and I completely understand your reasoning - I saw my mother die - and I was barely out of my teens. My kids did not get to meet either of their grandparents on my side, and I definitely want to be around for their adulthoods.  You can also think about intensive screenings (how old are you now? have you had any biopsies yet?) that includes mammograms, ultrasounds and MRI's. You can also look into tamoxifen as a chemopreventative and see if any of the oncologists would recommend that for you. A few other things to consider - as time marches on, the treatments and screenings will get better - they are already much better than they were when your grandmother was diagnosed, and even when your mom was diagnosed the first time.  I wish you all the best in this difficult decision. ",

On the good end, my supraclav area which finished at 25/28 is now 8 days post zap and beginning to peel dry skin and it no longer hurts, though it was never as bad as my scar line and surrounding area is now.

The first # is the \"tubule formation\" - I had a 3 as well, which is typical for lobular cancer - I'm less certain about it's implication for ductal. (So as far as I can tell, ALL ILC's get a 3 on that measure). The other two are measures of \"normal-ness\" (the second) and mitotic/cell division rate (the third). To me (with ILC), those second two measures are the critical ones - and the mitotic rate which you have is a 1, which is good. And  the \"normal-ness\" score (how different they look from normal cells) is also good.  Again, the oncotype test is a microarray test looking at gene expression, but there is general correlation between traditional pathology and oncotype (though it has the power to unveil oddballs, which is the good thing about it). My onc was pretty sure I wouldn't need chemo because of the pathology (even though it was a larger tumor) (and despite my anxiety, which was through the roof! Get some Xanax if needed). I had \"planned\" in advance that my cut off score would be 18 - 18 or higher and I would have done chemo. My score came back at a 7. good luck, and best wishes for the wait.",

I think your docs are saying probably chemo because 1) the pathology is grade 3, and 2) your age. My MO listened to my concern and said that if I did need chemo he would do TC only. If you do need chemo, ask about alternatives to A, and get a second opinion if your doc doesn't hear your concerns. Good luck :)",

Mine feels like it's just below skin, and sometimes achy, but not really sharp and it moves around a bit. I had a SNB +rads, so I guess there's some risk of LE, but I also had a very VERY mild case of shingles about a year before my DX, and I'm trying to remember if it's similar pain. I had one bump then, and it went away with the antiviral meds. No obvious bumps now, but I know shingles can trigger nerve pain with no sores.",

They switched me off the aloe lotion and onto \"Biafine\" which is more emollient but doesn't help with the itching. I'm going to ask the nurse tomorrow. I'm getting pretty pink too",

Not to scare you, but if you have dense breasts, mammograms are not always good at catching things. Mine was completely missed and not visible on the mammogram even after it had been felt by my doc. Look into an MRI and ultrasound esp if you have any family history. If it is questionable, see a breast specialist. That being said, it sounds like it might be a cyst and nothing suspicious.Don't worry about the wait, it won't affect anything negatively (other than worry levels!).",
