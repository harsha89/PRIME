But when I saw my oncologist he insisted on chemo and herceptin as well as a consultation with a radiation oncologist(did not end up having radiation). By there statistics if I had done nothing else after surgery I woulld have had a 40% chance of the cancer coming back in 10 years, but treatment dropped it done to only 10%. It all depends on your mother inlaws status and what odds she personally likes. Personally I wanted every edge I could get.",

Because of this my oncologist has ordered a bone scan to rule out the possibility of bone mets but feels the odds are slim that I have any. Now saturday morning I woke up with pain in my left shoulder that I felt was due to sleeping on it funny. It was painful throughout the day but nothing too crazy. Well this morning at 5:00am I was woken up by terrible pain in this same shoulder and I could barely move it. I went to emerg and the doc immediately did a nerve block to help with some of the pain and ordered xrays of the left shoulder. He could tell I definitely didn't have any fractures but there was a shadow he wanted the radiologist to read. The report came back as follows. \"on the lateral projection there is an area of lucency in the posterior aspect of the humeral head. Suggest a bone scan to exclude a lytic bone lesion. there is no soft tissue calcification\". The doc said it was a possibiltiy it was bone mets. He gave me some pain patches and a topical cream and told me to keep taking my hydromorphine for break through pain. It is really painful still. Could any of you ladies tell me if this sounds similiar to what you have encountered with bone mets? Thank god I already have a bone scan scheduled and its only a couple days away. I really appreciate any thoughts, thank you brenda",
