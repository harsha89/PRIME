You need to be very well monitored with stage IV.  It does sound like you have a good onc, maybe he needs to be just a bit more assertive & give you answers to why he recommends a certain treatment.  Femara & Zometa are still working after 2.5 years and I'm glad to check status every 6 months with Pet scans.

Did bi-lateral mastectomy after 1 year being stable.  Doing reconsruction now.  I'm hoping I don't have to do radiation.  Will go on Xgeva instead of Zometa as soon as my onc office gets it approved.  It's a shot instead of an infusion. I've handled chemo well.  I did take sublimininal B12 tablets and melatonin to help me sleep.  I also take glucosamine & chondrotin for joint pain & daily D3 & calcium.  I had some joint pain for about 6 months on Femara, than my body got used to it and I don't have it anymore.  Walking through the stiffness helped as you may feel stiff in the morning and have a hard time moving in the morning.  I had to take Femara at night as it made me feel  queesy taking it in the morning. Best to you on your treatment. Terri ",

The anti-hormonals will most likely cause some joint stiffness & some pain, but work well to keep your friend stable so she won't have to go on chemo right away. I was stable for 4 years on Femera and there are a few others I can try before I have to go back onto chemo. I was only on chemo due to having inflammatory bc which is a more aggressive cancer.

I'm on disability with a very large company and have great insurance.  My out of pocket is $1500 per year.  Believe it or not , being on SS disability even this amount is hard to come up with every year when your credit cards are maxed out. Last year however, I did have to pay $200 for nuelasta because my medical office would not accept it from my pharmacy coverage as it had to be shipped cold.  It did not matter that I reached my out of pocket max.

Wishing you lots of success with your treatment.  There is so much information here for you.  Please update us on your treatment. Terri",

If you don't want to pay the expense, I would suggest drinking bottled spring water like Arrowhead.  I just have this feeling that the minimum chlorine they put in water to make sure no one gets ill could be a problem as well as the hormones added to milk, eggs & meat.  I did not give up meat, but try to eat grass fed or meat with no antibiotics added to it. I wonder why there are so many young people coming down with cancer today.  There are a lot of 20 year olds and younger getting BC.  It would be great if some thorough testing could be done on what goes in our bodies.

You never know who is going to survive for many years or  who will die in the expected time lines so many doctors do not want to speculate, but they do know when the time is near.  At this time your doctors need to be upfront with you to prepare your family.  I do know of a few who have survived stage IV for 17 years, one for 30 years.  This is of course uncommon, but medicine has made great strides in treating this as a chronic condition.  Zometa & femara have worked for me the last 4 years and they are coming out with new drugs all the time.

States have different laws, but I bet due to the circumstances of you having cancer and not working; he should have to provide medical insurance for the family.  With the new healthcare laws in 2014, pre-existing conditions may be out the door and may not be as expensive as cobra.  At stage IV, I can not imagine a judge making you go out to find work due to your husband wanting a divorce. Maybe you and your husband can look at options outside the box---separtating but staying married or staying together for the family sake.  It was not easy for me on my own with my side of the family living on the other side of the country.  I had to move 3 times due to rent increases while going through chemo. If your husband is reasonable, you should both sit down while you are both calm to discuss how very difficult this is going to be to the kids and both of you financially.   At least he should hold off until financial arrangements can be made possibly like you taking out accelerated benefits on your insurance as a stage IV patient. I pray you don't have to go through this.  Your husband is going to have to deal with this for his kids sake even if you divorce--he's not going to be able to avoid this pain by divorcing you. Financially, I believe he is still responsible for you under these circumstances and it's going to cost him a lot to make this separation financially & emotionally.  I'm praying for you! Terri ",

There are many more stage IV living longer lives.  Sometimes one treatment may take you several years before it does not work for you anymore, and there are quite a few treatments they can transfer you to help you stabilize this disease.  I'm still on the first treatment.  Feel free to ask any questions you may have.  I'd be happy and I'm sure others will be happy to answer questions you have.

As a teacher, if she has worked long enough,she may be able to access her pension benefits.  I think accessing the term life for stage IV is a good thing to do.  I'm surprised that she had to mark STD/LTD & accelerated benefits upon hiring.  I was given these, I never had to check them.

Type a financial statement telling your loved ones everything you have left for them & list names, places & phone numbers for them to access.  I'm mailing mine to my sister.  Give away family heirlooms a head of time to those you intend them to go to.  Get together a photo book for your kids with pictures of the family since they've been born.  I also like the voice suggestion to leave your kids.  Write a journal for your kids of positive things you want them to know & to tell them how important they are to you. Believe me, I'm still in the process of getting all this together.  I'm proactive and a little too organized.  I want to have things in place in case I wont' have the energy or time to do it.  I don't want my family guessing or arguing and in a position to make difficult decisions.

On the 2nd one, my whilte blood counts skyrocketed downward that I could not have the following treatment. I'm doing every Mon with one monday off a month. I've been so lethargic that I sleep all day & night. I have no energy. I saw onc & spoke with her about my next one. SHe will be lowering the dosage by 20%, but did not want to alternate weeks to give me more time for my counts to come back up. She also does not want to use nuepegeon shots to bring them up as I could compromise my bone marrow. My question is would I do better getting an extra flush of IV fluids to flush out the toxins quickly right after chemo? Maybe the toxins wont be sitting in my body so long to bring my counts down?

My insurance has been great and have never refused payment, but to make sure I started doing the PETs yearly since I was stable. This last one showed progression of bone mets so I guess I'm back to doing them more frequently now. Terri",

I also found I did not have a voice to use the intercom on the bed and could not move my arms to press the buttom anyway.  After they took out the catheter, I had to painfully get out of bed myself to go to the bathroom.  I threw up the liquid diet and it was awful to boot, they gave me very sugary sorbet & popsicles that tasted terrible.  Alarms were going off all the time because the machines did not have new batteries and even then it seemed like more than an hour before the nurse would come in to check the noise.  I did not sleep for 2 nights, even with sleeping pills. I got myself dressed and sat in an uncomfortable chair Sat morning waiting for my sister to pick me up.  About 3 to 4 weeks later, I saw the bill from where the hospital charged $100,000 just for the hospital stay alone for 2 nights.  I thought for sure they must have been understaffed with nurses.  It's nice to know I was not the only one going through this.  I thought for awhile I was just delirious on drugs.   I know my outpatient exchange at the end of this month will go much better. Thank you ladies for giving the new surgery gals a heads up on this. Terri",

I don't see why you would not qualify to be put on your husband's insurance because I don't think they can deny a pre-existing condition but I could be wrong.  I think you can apply for SSDI anytime after the date of your stage IV diagnosis.  There's a 5 month waiting period and some get back pay.  It took me about a month for approval.  Make sure you mark your forms as compassionate allowance because they are processed right away. The best place to get answers would be your HR dept.  Good Luck on your search. Terri",

Bone mets only is the most treatable, but not curable. I'm ER+ & got 4 years out of Femera, now on Aromasin & Affinitor. I did 8 months of chemo because of the inflammatory bc, bi-lateral mastec with gel implants & AI's. I've also done Zometa infusions from the start which strengthened my bones. With bone mets, majority go on Zometa or Xgeva, which is a shot. Wondering if you were in a lot of pain from breaking rib? For the last week, I've had a lot of pain in my ribs on the left side where I did not have cancer. Waiting for a PET scan on Tues. What did they do for your broken rib? Terri ",

I get all my PET scans & read them b/4 speaking with my onc so I know what questions to ask.  I was pretty upset at the last one because a new radiologist read it and listed everything on it from 6/09 and even put I had lung lesions that I never knew about.  Apparently my onc said it proved the new medication A/A was working & I did not have to bother with the rest.  I trust my onc & let it go. It seems so strange to be told we do not have long to live when we feel ok, just a little tired.  My onc said he would put me through all the AI's b/4 going back to chemo.  I'm on my 2nd AI.  I know there are a lot more meds out there for you.  Did he talk about faslodex?  My onc has a patient stable on Faslodex for 6 years.  Each person is different.   Hoping your treatment works for a very long time.

We all try to plan how long we will be on disability, whether we will be able to keep some kind of medical insurance, whether we will be terminated from work if we choose to go back full-time and can not handle it.  I worry about the future and it's been difficult making decisions today when I don't know what to expect.  With metastatic; is it possible to be stable for more than 2,5 10 years?  I sure would appreciate any input you have on this.

It's been doable for me and I've given myself a year to get off all the weight.  Still need to lose about 45 lbs.  I use to overload on carbs.  You'll find if you limit carbs, you won't be hungry or craving anything (although you may be a bit fatigued).

The saline ones were hard but you may be able to go bigger in these.  The silicone gels are softer, more like real tissue but will be wider.  I was a DD and wanted to go smaller but feel I can still fit in a D cup because the of width. However, I'm able to just wear camisoles now.  I'm very happy with the gels.  Ask your PS about the recommended fit size.  I believe the gels only go to 800cc's, but you can get them as high profiles which will give you a bit more upfront. Whippetmom is the expert at size.  Give her your measurements and she can make a suggestion for you. Terri",

My medicare premiums are taken out of my SSDI checks b/4 receiving payment ($115 a month).  Medicare is primary & sends claims to Untited Healthcare (my 2ndry ins).  I pay 10%.  Each year my out of pocket goes up & my deductible is about $500 but much cheaper than many insurance companies. Companies do not have to offer medical insurance to those on LTD.  I believe you can get cobra until medicare kicks in, but it's more expensive.   You may be able to qualify for Obamacare with reduced premiums due to disability and no pre-existing conditions exist anymore, which is good.  After 5 years on disability, my company is outsourcing the insurance to retired employees to a private obamacare policy next year.  I have no idea about the coverage yet.  They put me on the retired list when I could not go back to work. The best place to ask these questions is with your company's benefits dept as we all work for different companies. Terri",

Adults have to make their own decisions and from past experiences in my own family, I realize that we can enable someone to continue making bad choices by offering too much help.  My brother-in-law finally got his act together from drug abuse when he no longer had his brothers to lean on.  He's a great father and provider now and keeps close to his church.  My own brother is a different story and really has not changed his life or drug abuse much. A friend of mine told me about a website at www.pointofreturn.com   They slowly ween people off of drugs with little side effects by reducing the dosage until they are not using at all.  It worked really well for his daughter.

Thankfully, my son forgave me after apoligizing many times.  He's such a sweet kid. Hope your foot get better soon and good luck with your scans. Terri",

Barbara:  After 3 weeks, I'm just starting to try to sleep on my side.  One side has too much tissue so I can not use that side, but the other seems ok.  Right after drains come out is not a good time to sleep on sides as it will increase leakage from drain areas until it scabs over.  It's a good thing I'm not married, my bed is still packed with pillows & a  sponge wedge I keep close to my body for sleep.  This wedge may help support your back a bit so you can try to sleep on one side.  Still working it out myself.  Sometimes I take benadryl to help me sleep.

I went to Kohls and got some nice Jockey seamless removable cup sports bras (2 for $32) and some  lighter weight colored sports bras without the heavy elastic band.  I also got some soft loose camis for $16.  What a difference.  I don't itch and if you are still draining fluids after the drains are removed, you can easily fit a folded washcloth under your armpit to catch any fluid. You can even put in some pads in the removable cup sports bras.   I think I spent less than 1/2 the cost for all 6 garmets than what I paid for 2 at a mastectomy store. Glad all of you are doing well after surgery.  Almost time to add our names to the expansion section. Have a great weekend. Terri",

Best Wishes on Chemo on the 10th.  I had 8 months of Taxotere & Cytoxan.  They gave me Emmed tablets to counter act nauseousness that worked really well.  Some side effects I had were bloody nose, teary eyes.  I took benadryl which cleared up some of the moisture in my eyes and helped with the nose bleeds a bit.  I was very fatigued and this will take time to get better.  I also had a gall stone 2cm that started acting up right after chemo.  Once they put me on Prilosec, I was fine.  Walking a bit will help with your energy levels.  Best to you on the chemo.  Let us know how it's going and if you need any support through this.

I now have liver mets, a new bone met, a fractured rib & my lymph node that was radiated is now twice the size. My doc is on 3 weeks vacation. I hear I may be doing a liver biopsy soon to see if my ER status has changed. I'll update once I find out what they will put me on next. I wish you successful treatments.
