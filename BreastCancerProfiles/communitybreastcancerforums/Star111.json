Realized something was up last summer when I began having electricity sensations in my breast. It started out of nowhere. I reached up to touch it as it occurred as it hurt quite a bit. That\u2019s when I felt a lump for the first time. I waited a month or so to see my doctor because I had always was told that breast cancer doesn\u2019t hurt. I figured it was maybe a cyst or something. My doctor appointment was in October. He felt three lumps and sent me for a diagnostic mammogram which was set for late November. After that I had a diagnostic ultrasound. I got a call from a breast surgeon in December saying I needed an mri because I had dense breasts and it created hard to see anything on the mammogram films. As for the ultrasound it showed nothing. My breast mri was late February. A few days later I got a call from the surgeon explaining that an enhancement was found on that mri. That I needed a biopsy and and ultrasound. My ultrasound was early April. It showed i needed a biopsy that should be Mri guided because it was a most accurate choice. The biopsy was in May. Then I received the news a week and a half ago that I have breast cancer and I had surgery two days ago. My diagnosis took nine months. If any lurkers are here, know that breast cancer can hurt. Not just cysts Log in to post a reply",

You ladies are comforting and helpful. Thank you My diagnosis is idc size 2.7 cm with two random dcis focal tumours nearby surrounding it. My surgery was a lumpectomy with wide margins and sentinel node dissection and biopsy. I won\u2019t know more on the histology until those results are back in 2-3 weeks. Here where I live the healthcare is a slow process although any important results came quickly. I am thinking positive that the nodes and margins are good. The surgeon told me that he removed a large plum size out of my breast to make sure he got it all. As a small breasted lady to begin with it seems like a lot. He said it\u2019s high grade three so he acted fast. I guess the difference between the February mri and the May mri were substantial. Anyways I\u2019m just glad they got it out. I know I need intense radiation for sure as he told me. I won\u2019t know about other additional treatments until the pathology results are back. Look forward to hearing from you ladies and thank you for your replies. Sincerely Star",
