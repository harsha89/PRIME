Gymrat, I have to have the lat flap because I had a tummy tuck 12 years ago.   I'm having with an implant because I am about a D cup and my PS said I will get a more natural look with both.  My main concern was to get this done and start to get my life back. This is the first step in that process.  All of this implant stuff is weird for me because they found my cancer after a routine biopsy after a breastr reduction in January.  There's irony for you - I now need an implant. You have to listen to your gut and be at peace with whatever decision you make.  Everyone is different and every case of cancer is different.  What works for some does not work for all.  I hope that helps and all the best.  Michelle",

I'm 40 years old and don't remember ever doing that.  I felt total panic. I'm hoping this will get better as I get closer.  I've planned a spa day for Friday - I'm sure that will help.",

April feels a long way off. I'll have to back for the nipple and aereola tatooing and I might need a little lipo on the side of my back where they aren't taking any tissue.
