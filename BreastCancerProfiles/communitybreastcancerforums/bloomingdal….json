I was diagnosed with ER+/PR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer in Feb 2015 and I'm on my first line treatment (Tamoxifen & Lupron). I'm interested in medical marijuana to mitigate bone pain. (Technically, one of my two tumors in my spine sits on my spinal nerve.) I'm a little confused as there seems to be mixed opinions. My questions to you are: (1) What is the appropriate ratio of THC:CBD given that I'm ER+/PR+/HER2-? I've read repeatedly that 1:1 or 1:3 is recommended. (2) Should I stick with a low concentration? I'm a little nervous about interactions with Tamoxifen.",

After my diagnosis in 2015, I was so nervous that I would have to slow down on travel. But as I started to build confidence, I started to travel again. My international travel work and personal plans have included Jamaica (2015); India, Argentina, Cayman Islands (2016); Tanzania, Rwanda, Philippines, China, and Japan (2017); Tanzania, Mexico, Tanzania, Tanzania, Ethiopia (2018); Tanzania, Tanzania, Malaysia (2019). As you can see, it's been busy :) For the most part, I have kept well. I'd bring the following (1) Cipro for basic traveler's diarrhea/GI concerns; (2) Non-Deet insect repellent; (3) Non-paraben and high zinc oxide sunscreen; (4) pain medication (even if you're not in pain); and (5) your medications divided into two different sections w/at least double the dose. (I once had my Tamoxifen bottle open and liquid spilled into it. I had to get brand new Tamoxifen en route in Turkey.) Good luck and DM if you want specific tips! Happy to help!",
