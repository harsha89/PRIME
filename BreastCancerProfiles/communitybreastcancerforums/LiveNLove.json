I recently visited a second breast surgeon and am now going with a different treatment plan which includes pre-surgery chemotherapy, taxol (sp?), Herceptin and Perjeta. I've heard really good things about Perjeta. I wish you many blessings as well.",

There has been a lot of information given to me within the past 2 weeks and I have been blessed with an oncologist that is extremely compassionate and spent over 40 minutes with me during my first visit explaining things and answering my list of written questions. However, I would like to know some stories from others whose tumor(s) are positive for estrogen, progesterone and HER. I have decided to go with a bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction (immediate, hopefully.) I have not yet decided on a breast surgeon, but will be meeting a second next week. My oncologist told me that the course of treatment following the mastectomy is: chemo for about 4 months (I forgot how many rounds he told me that will consist of), followed by one year of a (chemo?) drug and 5 years of hormone therapy. Sorry that I do not have the name of the drugs. I really should have taken notes. If anyone else has/had such a tumor, can you please share your treatment experience with me? Log in to post a reply",

I am hoping to meet others that have experienced and/or are experiencing a breast cancer battle. I am seeking to uplift others and find a bit of encouragement for myself. God bless and God speed to us all! :)",
