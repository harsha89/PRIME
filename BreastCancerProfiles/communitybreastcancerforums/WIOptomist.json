About 8 weeks post radiation a scab developed on my nipple and in the past 3+ months it has started to itch/burn. In my MO and RO visits they both have told me they don't know what this is and haven't seen it before They sent me for an MRI - which revealed nothing. In my last RO visit, (post MRI) he had me take a hot bath and remove the scab (3 weeks ago). The scab has come back. I called him this morning (he is on vacation) and left a message that I need to know what this is and would like a biopsy. Has anyone experienced something similar.",

Can I really be that different from their other patients that both Drs haven't seen this before or know what it is.
