In 2007 i was dignoised again with small cancer in other breast had second mastectomy. Now in physcal in 2012 found that it had mastisis in 8 places. Im 65 at that time and took this well. I went thru chemo trestment for 6 rounds, I continued working thru this then when i found I was in remission I colapsed and now on heart meds and have been having hrrceptin infusion every 3 wks. my problem is stupid but I find my selve 2 years after initial diagnose fighting crying all time. my husband is very supportive. i have been able to not let him see the depression or tears. I have never been a weak person and always positive. I do not feel this is good for me and do not underdtsnd. i know i am very lucky  that I have not been sick thru all of this. I am hoping that putting this in writing this will help. Log in to post a reply",
