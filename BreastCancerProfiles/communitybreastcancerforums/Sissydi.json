I called her up to see how she was doing, and maybe find another breast cancer sister in the area to talk to. She said, her surgeon told her no immediate reconstruction is good because when surgery is preformed on the breast, the cancer is like seeds blown from a dandelion when they are disturbed, and wanted her in chemo right away, so recommended recon after treatment is all over. She was saying my doc should not have recommended immediate recon because of this. Has anyone heard of this? I don't think cancer works this way. And I'm having a hard time thinking about cancer seeds blown throughout my body after mastectomy! What???
