But other than that I had no issues with either drug. I was told that it takes 1 year for your body to get rid of the chemo. And that the chemicals just like any other drug are in your hair shafts. This is what causes your hair to be curly, coarse and frizzy when it first grows out. My hair came back all gray and I had it colored when it got long enough to dye it. It grew very slowly for a while, but after about 4 cuts, I seemed to have my old hair back. And once that happened, it started growing fast and it got thick again just like it used to be. There were times when I thought my hair would never grow back, then there were patches on my head that were thinner than the rest of my head. But eventually it all went back to normal, and it now seems so long ago that I was worrying about it. Unfortunately it requires a lot of patience, and I am not a patient person, so it was really hard for me some days. But it happens, and before you know it your life is back on track and all of this will be behind you.",
