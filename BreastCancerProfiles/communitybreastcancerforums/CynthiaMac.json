I am 65 and have had annual mammograms for many consecutive years so this thing can't be that bad.  The latest mammogram showed a tumor as did the subsequent altrasound.  The biopsy confirmed cancer but I have not been told what kind.  My primary doctor (not an oncologist)  did not give me any information at all, just that she wanted the surgery as soon as possible.  She will schedule and appointment with a surgeon on Monday.  Will the surgeon be able to define the cancer further for me? Not ready to stampede just yet. Log in to post a reply",

Many, many thanks and I will write you after the surgical appointment. - Cynthia",
