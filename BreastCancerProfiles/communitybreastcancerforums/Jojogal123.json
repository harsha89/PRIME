I was diagnosed BRAC2+ in 2007 - surveillance screening and just diagnosed with DCIS Stage 0 (no information on receptor status). Doctors strongly recommend BMX. I have it scheduled (as well as DIEP) for 3/13. I know I am doing the \"right thing,\" but part of me feels like I am making a mistake. Here is my question, and please excuse me if it's indelicate. Have any of you NOT done a MX and wish you had? Or, on the other hand, have there been people in this situation that have done it and wish they hadn't? Part of me feels like I should spare my breasts, treat this with lumpectomy and radiation and continue my surveillance. Yes, the BC may come back, but I can deal with it then and keep my breasts. Please help me come to peace with the decision to do this. (BTW, have made peace with oopherectomy as I have 2 children and strongly see - and feel- the benefits of that surgery).

Turns out the DCIS actually was triple negative stage one and I am having chemo. Doing the MX would not have saved me from that. I would just be going through menopause (did proph. ooph) AND chemo. Maybe I will have it in the future...but not to treat this cancer.",

I need to hear these stories and scary statistics to know I am doing the right thing. I was not aware that <<Also you are more likely to get a more aggressive BC like triple negative. >> - this is the type of thing that is helpful to hear. Thanks for your input. Happy Valentine's Day!",
