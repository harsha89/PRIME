He's afraid his patients are going to come back to him and say, \"But you told me something positive.\" EEK.. Yes, we do know all the downsides all too well. Even my BS, who was the most encouraging of all my docs gave me a \"bad day\" once. I was considering having an ooph at time of surgery....He was opposed to it (while my gyne was in favor).  He said, \"You have to look at whether the benefits would be worth it for you over a period of time\"...or something to that effect. Of course I went home and thought, \"He knows I'm going to die...and he thinks it's not worth me having the ooph.\" Well, I had the ooph, and here five years later NED. Great idea your DH had to write down the positives. And some days I told my DH that I just was not up to making everybody (Mom) feel better. It's ok to be a hermit sometimes. Moms just want to fix it and when they can't, of course it's hard for them. But I asked my mom not to go to chemo with me because it was too hard to watch her upset. Surround yourself with positive thoughts...read the positive success stories....and know that lots of us are doing just fine five and more years out. That will be you in five years, and you'll be sharing your story with somebody else walking the journey. Hugs Moissy",

I totally agree with CookieGal that, although common, strapless is often just not the most flattering on any woman once they see their actual wedding photos, so I wouldn't focus too much on having to exclude that style. I did purchase a formal gown last year and tried lots of things on. I had a unilateral mast. One thing I found was some of the bridal assistants didn't understand that I couldn't just add straps to a strapless. I needed a little more coverage. There are lots of beautiful gowns in other styles. I did end up with a one-shoulder gown...which depending on which side (left or right) the \"shoulder\" is on can cover perfectly. You will find just the right dress...and the fun thing will be having something positive to look forward to once your treatment is completed. Enjoy and focus on the beautiful! You will be a beautiful bride!  Good luck.",

Due to the size of my tumor, I was told I would need to wait until six months later. It's now 5 years later. The docs occasionally still ask me if I am considering recon. Having considered all the options available, for me, I just don't want to do it. You can always choose to have it done later. I had read posts on this site from women who had gone through the surgery, and I just didn't want to do it. It doesn't matter how old or young you are, the surgery is what it is.  If it would bring back the sensations and give me a breast that functioned like the one I lost, I'd do it in a heartbeat. But I know that isn't the case.   I would never have thought I would be happy without recon, but I am.   I think sometimes good intentioned \"outsiders\" push us toward the recon because they think it is going to \"fix\": things. And they want us to be happy. I felt very differently six months after the surgery than I did beforehand. Listen to your inner gut, and take your time to make your decision. I am happy that the options exist for reconstruction. Maybe someday I will change my mind. But for now, I am  happy as is -- and know that I have the option to recon at any time in the future if I decide I want to. Good luck with your decision.",

Very different from traditional insurance particularly when it comes to coverage for oral targeted therapies. Options and laws vary by state. I did talk with a SHIP person but in my state it is staffed primarily by volunteers, so not always equally knowledgeable. One of the very best resources I found was Boomer Benefits www.boomer benefits.com. There is a ton of educational info on their site and they are a broker that specializes in Medicare type plans. They can sell in almost all states. (I have no affiliation with them other than I purchased my plan through them.) I ended up with an \u201coriginal Medicare\" plan plus a Medigap supplement that covers the full 20 percent that Medicare does not. I pay about $140 per month for a Medigap supplement. Anything that Medicare covers 80 percent, the supplement will automatically cover. I never have copays for anything.There was no issue with preexisting condition at all as long as I signed up when first eligible. Trying to change plans later is a completely different story though, so you want to make the right choice the first time. You may also need a separate drug plan for pharmacy drugs however if you go with OriginalMedicare. Check out Boomer Benefits and you'll be surprised at the educational info available online.",

Following your posts, I have recently ordered the Silique Comfort Lite, which arrived today. And I love it! So light! So soft!  Park is no longer carrying them, so I ordered through TruKare, which was the only place I found them online. I read your posts about stitched vs. fused. This was stitched, but I am keeping it as I could not find it anywhere else. But back to your question....I've had two different Radiant Impressions forms in the past five years. While they are certainly the closest match in size/shape to my remaining breast, I do NOT like the feel of them against my skin at all. It feels very sticky/tacky....as you've mentioned you've experienced that with other forms. Just a personal thing, but I do not like the feel of silicone against my skin. And the Radiants are so form fitting to your skin that at times they actually can create a kind of suction and if you bend a certain way you can feel them peeling away from your skin if you bend over. Don't like that peeling sensation.....Since the form is too large to wear in a pocket bra, the fitter suggested I could try putting it in a prosthesis cover. So that's what I usually do when wearing one of my own bras. When I first got one (my very first prosthesis) I tried wearing without any bra -- just using the adhesive on the skin. Didn't like peeling the glue off skin afterward and after sweating, the prosthesis came loose, so I never tried it that way again.  Honestly after getting the Silique form, I would prefer that over my Radiant Impressions unless I were to be wearing something really form fitting. In that case, the RI's look great, but I much prefer the softness and light weight of the Silique. Thanks for pointing me that way. I also had just ordered the First Form 916 due to the other comments I had read...and before I saw your new review of it....I'm giving it a try. Maybe good for when I'm on the treadmill... but loving the Silique! Thank you. Moissy",

I\u2019m glad you are getting more heads to review your options at a larger center. You have every reason to believe that while Afinitor didn\u2019t workfor you, your next treatment can be very effective. And miraculous that they got you in for an appt within two days. Excellent!

One thing my pharmacist pointed out to me was that my onc had prescribed a mouthwash that had high alcohol content. The pharmacist asked the doc if the RX could be switched to the same dexamethesone mouthwash but one that was formulated without alcohol. The pharmacist felt it would be much easier on the mouth. I only used it infrequently, but found it helpful for the occasional mouth sore. I started abemaciclib (Verzenio) plus faslodex about a week ago and so far, so good! Wishing you all the best!

If it stays like this, I'll be thrilled. My blood sugar increased on last test, but not a concern as yet. Had one small mouth ulcer--no different than I might have randomly gotten some other time when not on treatment. Healed within a day or two. And sometimes small amounts of blood in the tissue when blowing nose in the morning. That's really been it. On the bright side it's motivated me to start walking again so I can notice any potential shortness of breath. Hi, treadmill. Have you missed me? On the brightest side, after five months of rising TM's, my markers dropped 15 percent after being on Afinitor for just 12 days. So glad your TM's stabilized and wishing you even lower numbers next time around. Seems very likely since you stabilized so quickly!",

But I had no side effects at all when aromasin was added to the mix. So for me, I don't think it would have added any side effects to Afinitor. We're all so different. Glad you are feeling well.
