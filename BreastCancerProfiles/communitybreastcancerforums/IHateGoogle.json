The redness and itchiness has decreased after using cortisone cream after the last two nights. My breasts are always asymmetrical, and it is obvious in photos that one is fuller than the other. There seems to be some maybe ridging on underside. It isn't sore to touch, but both breasts have been tender. I have an appt on Tuesday Log in to post a reply",
