And under the arms  I feel the same thing.  lumpy hard nodule and slightly painful..Just wondering if the is a progression rearing it's ugly head or scar tissue around the area where nodes were removed. I'm thinking of letting it go a few more weeks with my onc visit coming up.  I worry about everything in these areas with obvious physical issues",
