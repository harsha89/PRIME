I was reading all of your posts though and have been praying for you all as we go through this together. By my last treatment I was peeled, red and even my blisters had blisters. Also swollen. I had been using aquaphor regularly, and Aloe Vera. The pain has continued after treatments but now at one week out I feel like I'm actually healing. The fatigue has lifted too, for the most part. At the beginning of week 3 my RO gave me a lidocaine/aquaphor cream which helped a lot. The day after my last treatment I saw my MO and she prescribed me a big bottle of hydrocodone which was a lifesaver. I was off work the last week of treatments. I went back to work three days after my last treatment and it was awful, even with all the meds and cream.If I could change anything I would've taken the last two weeks of rads plus a full week after off. But it's just so hard to plan time off when you don't know how you'll react.",

I was reading through some of my medical papers this morning and after my last treatment the RO wrote that my side effects from treatment were fatigue and \"some skin irritation\". Call me a drama queen but my breast was at least two cup sizes bigger from the swelling and I was blistered, peeling, bright red. Some skin irritation just doesn't seem accurate to me but what do I know? ML- I need to update my settings. I was supposed to start the tamoxifen right after rads but when my MO saw me she decided I needed a month to heal and then I'll start. She gave me a big bottle of hydrocodone instead of tamoxifen- not gonna lie that was a nice surprise :) I am really nervous about starting it but of course the thought of not being here for my kids and grandson (and hopefully future grandkids) makes me believe that it will be worth the side effects.

Not sure what to believe, I read and hear so much contradicting stuff. I hit the half-way mark today with treatment 10. Getting darker pink, swollen, hot to the touch. Also every day in a little more tired. My RO said I have fluid build up causing the swelling and told me I need to wear a bra 24/7 to help force it out. The rads tech told me to not wear a bra as much as possible to help with the skin burns. If I have to pick one or the other to alleviate I'm going with the skin burn.",

It's a shorter time period but doses are higher so from what I understand you still get the benefit of the longer treatments, but don't need as many appointments. It's a 200 mile round trip for me so it worked out good for me this way. I had 0 lymph nodes and clear margins. Tumor was 1.8cm, I didn't have to do chemo but radiation was never really in question. Everyone on my team recommended it. Are you not having chemo? I was told that if I had lymph nose involvement, or if my tumor would have been 2 or more cm, or if my oncotype score would've been 18 or higher that I would've had to do chemo as well. I felt very lucky to come under on all of those. Maybe age plays into it? I'm 41, which they consider young, even though I'm a grandma! Lo Dizzy- my skin broke down really bad. The last week was pure agony, no sleeping, fever, blisters, rawness, etc. after my last treatment the pain continued at that rate for 4-5 days then plateaued. After a week it was improving and now at ten days out I feel so much better. Still have healing to do but nowhere near the pain I was in before. Hang in there! You're almost there!!

Hap, I did take whole breast pictures almost every day for the last couple weeks. Not sure if I'll confront my RO. He's young and arrogant and I'd just as soon not be talked down to by someone like that. I could be wrong, but I think he is somewhat ignorant. I am very fair skinned, which you could obviously see just by looking at me. At my consult before starting I told him I was worried because I have really sensitive skin and I burn quickly in the sun even when using sunscreen. He brushed my comments off as not concerning, and then he told me that he actually sees more radiation skin reactions on black and Mexican women than fair skinned women. Everything I've read online contradicts that. I would have switched to another RO but we are rural so I would've had to drive 3 more hours each way to the next closest cancer center. I started putting aquaphor healing ointment on twice a day one week prior to starting radiation. I continued that but added Vaseline intensive therapy with Aloe at least twice a day when I started treatments. These were both recommended by my RO. I showered every morning before treatments and never applied the lotions until after treatment. A week before I was done I was given a lidocaine/aquaphor mixture to help numb the burned areas.",
