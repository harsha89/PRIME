Sounds like we are \"two peas in a pod\" getting the same run around from  Dr's and surgeons who are obviously not up to date that although uncommon woman do get breast cancer in their 20s without family history! Gosh I hope you are able to get some answers. I'm in a state of giving up right now and just waiting the next 6 months. Hopefully you are having better luck than I!! Toni Lynne ",

The radiologist has me on a 6 month-1 year wait and watch, but my PCP said no way and that I needed a 2nd opinion which is what I am going for in August (MRI). Glad to hear you got good news, the wait and watch is hard, it's been almost 4 months for me so far and the wait got so much easier to think about after the first 2 months! lol.  :)",

They did the same thing to me when I went in for my mammo and US (I am 29). The lady literally said in a sad voice \"oh honey, you are just a baby\". Talk about freaking me out! The radiologist met with me after my appt and said I mad micro-calcifications on my breast but only put me at a BiRads 1. I am meeting with a general surgeon August 1 at the urge from my PCP to get a breast MRI done. Then have another Mammo scheduled this fall (october I believe) for more followup. If you are feeling uneasy talk to your PCP, my radiologist kind've brushed me off and said he basically wants to play the waiting game and my PCP was like \"the earlier the better\" and wants to be very aggressive with the testing ect. The general surgeon will guide me into my next steps.",

I've heard they mail them if the results are normal, I think because mine required a little more followup he spoke with me directly. My US didn't show anything on it neither did the mammogram when it came to my lump. Our bodies are so weird! If they want you to come back in a year that's good, they want to make sure it doesn't turn into something and go undetected. I would make a list of your concerns to talk to your PCP. I always get so overwhelmed with this stuff when I finally get the doctor in front of me I forget all my questions, then leave so confused! Last time I met with my PCP he helped me list all my potential concerns, and questions and possible outcomes for when I meet with the general surgeon. I think that is going to be really helpful! Ask your DR what the lump is? It might be a cyst which you can have drained and alleviate the pressure so maybe it won't but you anymore?  I'm in the middle of all this same stuff as you, just 1 step ahead so I'm not much help hahaha. It sounds like you don't have anything to worry about though which is a gooooooood thing! Hopefully your PCP can answer some lump questions for you though!",

I'm only 29 and have dense breasts (because  of my age) so he is pushing for  me to get in and get an MRI and biopsies.  I  guess just go with your gut, if you need a 2nd opinion to calm yourself or reassure yourself I say go for it.  I actually waited about 4 months now to get mine, I'm hoping I don't regret that choice! I feel like something is wrong I'm just scared it will be too early to catch it so I held off a little before going in again for more tests.  It's your body so be proactive with your health care. Don't let someone make you wait if you don't want to, and don't allow someone to make you get more tests than you feel are necessary. Do some research for yourself and make your own, educated choices! Sending hugs your way  Toni",
