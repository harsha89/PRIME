Either way, it probably won't change anything as far as the outcome. You might want to see if you can get a breast MRI done in the meanwhile. Each imaging tool looks at tissue in a different way. Depending on your Dr's experience in their field, one may or may not have a more accurate answer. Bottom line is, neither will know for sure until a biopsy is done. I have complete trust in my BS and would probably take her advice vs. a Radiologist that I may see once or twice. If you are not happy with your Dr',s for sure, get another opinion. good luck in your decision-it's not an easy one~    ",

Our different relationships dictate how we tell people. You may cry with one person and be fine with the next. I don't think it's a \"one size fits all\" kind of thing. My Mom and half-sister have also had BC-so they understood what I was going through right away. Brave face. My 2 children are grown and that was the hardest for me.Tears. I am so thankful that my family was there for me. I really can't remember how I told close friends and the rest of the family.

There are a lot of meds to counter-act her SE's, so ask her MO for them at the first sign. 24 hr Claritin may help with bone pain she has from the Neulasta shot. Take a day or two before and after. Maybe they could reduce the chemo dose slightly, if nothing else. Make sure she stays hydrated also. Small bland, snack type meals, often.

I am no Dr, but these just came to mind. I doubt insurance would cover those if you have no known mutation, anyway. You can always seek another professional opinion. I had a previous hysterectomy and have a family history also, with no known mutation. I have also heard of topical tamoxifen, but I think it is fairly new. Not sure about it being used as a preventative. There is a lot of information out there regarding supplements, exercise, etc. I have read that turmeric/curcumin and baby aspirin are used as a \"preventative\" also, but I doubt there have been any formal studies. I think the anti-inflammatory properties are what the potential benefit would be. Best wishes.",

My first BS said come back in 12 mos, annual mammos, etc. I chose to go to another surgeon who understood my concerns and was on the same page with me. I did get a lumpectomy, luckily benign. Both Drs concurred that it was most likely benign...but, the difference was that the second Dr told me the only way to be sure was to do a biopsy...I felt much more comfortable with that...to me, it was not worth the worry. Get your records and films and go to another Dr-a breast specialist. I got the name of my BS from a friend who was taking chemo for BC at the time-she asked the nurses who the best BS was in the area and they gave her 3 names. I feel much better now knowing it's gone and I got an answer.  In 1998, my younger sister (28 yrs old) was told her lump was \"nothing\"- BI-MX and 12 yrs later she is fine, but did have an aggressive breast cancer. Good luck and best wishes~I am guessing you are in Texas? I am in the Austin area if you want my BS's name, let me know.",

The facility I go to is a multi-disciplinary group and they have a tumor board, so my BS was able to discuss treatment options with other Dr's.

I had a mammo which showed normal ; MRI was ordered...it showed a suspicious mass,recommended U/S with biopsy, if possible. Well, I didn't have my copy of the medical report at the time. My BS ordered the U/S ONLY, no biopsy-U/S came back as \"thought to be a lipoma.\" she said come back next yr. When I got the copy of the MRI report that said biopsy warranted, I did not feel comfortable with it. Did a bit of poking around on the internet, found report that said lipomas are not always that easy to diagnose w/o a biopsy; there is about a 25% margin of error. So, my new Dr said he could do a needle biopsy, but if I wanted to be sure, I should get an excisional... and I wanted to be sure., so got the excisional two days ago. It was a local anesthesia with sedation, which is kind of confusing., but you really are asleep. I do not remember anything after I got into OR-I had my IV in place, the anesthesiologist put something in my IV and the next thing I know, I was back in my room! I never took any pain meds at all; Dr used glue and I showered the next day. Put a little ice on it a few times and was a bit groggy the first night, but back to normal Thursday. My lump was very palpable and close to the surface, so he did not have to go very deep. It was in fact a lipoma. But, I do have a family history and dense breasts, so I do not regret my decision. I worried over it for too long and just needed to get a definitive answer. I was very lucky that I had a easy time with my surgery and it was benign, but I also know that I wanted to do everything that  I could to be sure I would be here for my kids and grandkids...that's my story and I'm sticking to it!

I took Tamoxifen for 2.5 yrs instead of the recommended 5. I tolerated chemo very well. So far, so good! Of course, we all know, there are no guarantees either way. I have started buying more organic foods when possible and use hygiene products that contain no parabens. I had low Vit D when DX'd and have been taking supplements. You may want to get a second opinion or get the Mamma-print test done. There are many factors to consider. It's a hard decision, that should not be taken lightly.

It is nice to have when they are doing your chemo infusion; it really is a lot easier than trying to poke around for a good vein...for safety, ease of infusion, time saving. The nurses will give you a numbing spray or solution if you want one before they poke you, but it's so fast, you are over it in a split second. No worse than a vaccination....probably easier. They will flush the port periodically so it is cleaned out. I never had any problems at all with mine. Your fear is probably much worse than reality. Best wishes. You can do it!:)",

I think LCIS is Lobular Carcinoma In Situ. In Situ meaning that it is confined to the lobes,  but is a malignancy. When it becomes invasive and goes outside the lobes, it becomes ILC. Invasive Lobular Carcinoma. Same with Ductal.  I had DCIS and IDC both. Maybe the ALH was what she was referring to as \"pre-cancer\"....? I believe you will be treated using the guidelines from the \"worst\" DX of your pathology report. It can be very confusing. When in doubt, keep asking questions! Good luck. ",

I believe that the higher grade tumors respond better to chemo than the lower. I would be surprised if you were a high MP. Sometimes the risk of chemo out-weighs the benefit I was offered, but declined the MP test, after getting an intermediate onco-score. I think the MP is becoming more of a standard practice than it was when i was DX'd. Best wishes to you all!",

I was DX'd with Grade 3 on biopsy and down-graded to Grade 2 after LX and LND. But, I also had an intermediate onco score of 21, so opted for chemo. I am one year past my LX. My tumor was close to my chest wall, but I did get clear margins and had radiation also. All in all, I have no regrets regarding my treatment decisions. I have also read that a higher grade usually responds well to chemo.  The Grade is not the only determining factor in your prognosis; try not to read too much into it. Once you have surgery, maybe more scans, etc., your MO will be able to give you the whole picture and plan your treatment accordingly. Will you be getting the BRCA genetic testing done? Wishing you the best! ",

She is NED from neck down. She had WBR 1 year ago this October. My question is this - have any of you heard about: abemaciclib plus trastuzumab with or without fulvestrant or chemotherapy in women with hormone receptor positive (HR+),  I understand from my friend's neuro-oncologist that this drug is being fast tracked by the FDA (ETA is Q4 2016 or Q1 2017) for woman who have triple negative type of BC and that it hopefully can be used \"off-label\" for HR+ (triple positive) candidates. My friend was in a clinical at Dana but had to resign due to liver toxicity. That drug is also being fast tracked from our meetings with her oncology team (ARRY-360) - I believe that ARRY-360 is still in clinical and it is not being moved as quickly as ABEMACICLLIB which is the drug we are interested in (it is an immunotherapy drug)..

I spent a lot of time in a hot bath tub, walking, reading, spending time with friends, staying away from the negativity. I know that is not always something you can do while you are going through BC and have children. Look for resources on the internet or through your practioners.

My MO said I would have about a 50% benefit (6-7%), so I decided on chemo. I am otherwise healthy (except for bone loss, which I just found out about). I based my decision on my future and how I would feel if I had a recurrence and didn't do all I could today to try and prevent it. I felt like this was my only chance and I needed to take advantage of it while I could. I am thankful that we have options that others didn't have several years ago. I am anxious to see the results of the clinical trial on intermediates that is supposed to be completed by next yr. As much as I dreaded the chemo, it really wasn't too bad for me as far as side effects.  I am going to my first rads appt tomorrow for consult and planning. Then, I will be on HT for five yrs. Right now, I just want my hair to start growing back! It is really a personal decision and not an easy one. I hope you all get all the information you need to make the right one for you. I am a believer in following your intuition... Have a good week-end!",

If I remember correctly, they did one draw at the beginning, middle and towards the end. But, I've slept since then and have chemo brain!:). Good luck. Sorry you had such a rough time. If you had to have surgery, for the port, they would have to stick you again for the anesthesia, so that isn't really a solution, I wouldn't think....? ",

Have your tried calling the company themselves? Not sure what to tell you about radiation. You can always get a second opinion. I personally would wait until I got the results back before I made any big decision or started any treatment.  If your genetics are positive, they may suggest BMX; if not, then maybe just rads or HT, idk.

My BS said she took my surgery results to the \"tumor board\" (other Drs), before making her recommendation of surgery. I met with my RO and MO shortly after DX, I think. I think it was actually my MO that spoke to me about chemo and RO about rads, not my BS. BS told me what type of surgery she thought would be the best. Sometimes they will do an onco-type and/or mammaprint test regarding chemo, also. Everyone is different and we all react differently to meds, chemo, rads, etc. Just be your own advocate and ask questions, if you are concerned about side effects, etc. It looks like you have the same DX as me! I had an intermediate onco score of 21; MO said it was up to me whether or not to do chemo. Luckily, none of my TX's were really hard on me and very manageable. I am on Tam now and have a few hot flashes, night sweats now and then, but nothing else. Keep us posted. Good luck with your up-coming surgery! Feel free to PM anytime. ",

I am always meeting new people and learning new things. Never a dull moment! I volunteer for a local Boxer Rescue Group when I have time. I love gardening, antiquing, spending time outdoors, read, (but, not as much as I should), do needlework sometimes. I have my \"foster fail\" Boxer, Sweet Pea and a Cockatiel, Harley, to keep me company. I am single, have 2 wonderful children, DD, 32 and DS 35. They have blessed me with 6 grand-children, who are the light of my life! They all live close enough so that I get my Grandma-time in, often. Two of them will be spending the night tonight:). Happy Holidays and blessings to you all!!!",

Your white blood count could drop and compromise your immune system. Don't let it get out of hand. Drink lots of water, walk if you feel like it. I felt fine the first few days after infusion, then had 4-5 crappy days, then felt better again before the next round. I tried to stay as active as I could, but it was challenging at times.

You should discuss your pathology with your Dr. and ask why he recommends chemo. A higher grade tumor responds to chemo better than a lower grade; they look at family history, genetic mutations, co-morbidities, etc. Unfortunately, cancer treatment is not as black and white as we think it would be. If you are not comfortable with your Dr's recommendations, gather all of your medical reports, get as much information as you can and seek a second opinion. There are no guarantees and everyone responds differently to treatment. Ultimately, it is your decision, but not to be taken lightly, imo. My onco-score was 21. I don't have any regrets doing chemo.

It was something I thought about a lot and then when the time came, when I was losing my hair, me and my DD told him. We told him what we thought he could handle in a way that he could understand, but not be too upsetting to him. Now, he looks at pictures of me with my long hair, before chemo and doesn't remember my hair ever being long. He hasn't asked me about it since. Of course, we don't live in the same household, and, if we did, I would not hesitate to tell him. Like someone else posted, 5 yr olds are very smart and intuitive to the \"normal\" routines and any change will probably raise a red flag. I would also not want to take the chance that he accidentally hears it in another way. Best wishes as you work through this difficult decision. For me, telling my adult children has been one of the hardest things I have had to do, while dealing with this DX, so I know you are struggling. Maybe contact ACS and see if they have any information that might be helpful also. Bless you all!",

Please let your MO's know of the least of any SE's you may have so they don't get too far ahead of you! I was very fortunate and my SE's were minimal. I worked most of the time and had very few down days. There is a thread here also that has a list of \"chemo supplies\", if you are like me and feel the need to plan ahead. Let those around you know specifically what you need...dinner, a ride, cleaning house, babysitting, etc.  This is about YOU! Don't be afraid to ask for help. ACS also has a program called \"ride to recovery\" for anyone needing a ride to appts, etc. My hair was also a big deal to me; I donated 11\" and still had a bob left when I cut it prior to chemo. I did not shave my head and left whatever didn't fall out until my new growth started, so I never was completely bald. You can call your local American Cancer Society and they will fit you with a free wig and sometimes give you a scarf or two. There is another website that will send you a free scarf/hat, but I can't remember who it was. Regarding insurance/deductibles: talk to your financial counselors at your Cancer Centers if you need assistance. There are guidelines you have to meet, but I qualified for almost my entire $5500 deductible for this yr to be paid. The neulasta shot and a large part of one chemo TX.  A grant paid for chemo and the pharmaceutical company paid for the shot, I believe. Since I had to meet my deductible for last yr , in Sept, and then had a new dedcutible in January, it was a huge relief. I didn't intend to make this so long... Wishing you all the best and a full and speedy recovery! ",
