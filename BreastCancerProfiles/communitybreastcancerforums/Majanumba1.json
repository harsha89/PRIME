After treatments 1 and 2 I had terrible side effects with nausea and vomiting and we tried Zofran (ugh) and Phenegren. I already knew that I was allergic to compazine . Out of desperation my onc prescribed ativan and it seems to really work. My onc nurse says that anticipation can cause the nausea and vomiting and I really do get very nervous before they pump me full of these chemicals that are going to save my life! Otherwise, I am just taking it easy today and trying to stay calm and centered.I have been doing yoga and meditating along with walks when it is not so cold!! I know about the nosebleeds and the onc told me to put a little Neosporin in each nostril. That seems to help. I am a little spacey but someone asked about my treatment schedule 6 x TCH each followed by Neulasta 24 hours later. Simvog, my next treatment #4 is February 9. After that , only 2 more to go!!!!!! Thankyou for welcoming me into the group and providing me with info, support and laughs when I need them. Welcome Sonia, glad you posted. Spring is just around the corner. Carolyn",

Is anyone one else suffering from dry itchy eyes? I feel like I have a bad allergy. I will ask my onc next Monday before Tx #4. I had herceptin yesterday and it seems to be worse today. I need to run out to the store as we are expecting more SNOW this afternoon. I had to throw everything in the fridge out after being w/o power for 5 days. We had just gone grocery shopping before the big ice storm hit! Good luck to all who have treatment this week. Carolyn",

I am on the TCH regimine every 3 weeks with a herceptin infusion every monday and a Neusasta shot 24 hrs after the biggie. Usually the big 18 wheeler mows me down on Tues. night after the TCH and I pull myself together about Day 8. Went for tx 3 today and it was hard knowing what might be coming. nausea and vomiting are not my friends. The second half of the second week and week 3 just get better so I really can't complain toooooo much ( at least on my first posting) I was prompted to join to let Firni know that her insurance cannot turn her Reconstruction down. A law was passed by Congress in 1998 and signed by Clinton that gives every woman the right to have reconstructive surgery to restore her breasts and make them match up!!!(very important when one the real one is saggier than your pretty new one. I am sure that your PS knows this and that they just dropped the ball in billing. Iam sorry that this has caused you unnecessary stress but I know you will get it cleared up. Glad to meet you amazing, wild crazy breast cancer sisters and I want you to know lots of healing love is flowing from my fingers to my macand over the internet to each one of you",

So 3 of us in a small hotel room with 2 double beds. at least it is warm and there is a Cineplex next door.

It is day 8 after TX # 3 and I still feel pretty bad. Mostly just fatigued and nauseous. Otherwise not many complaints...ha! Herceptin this afternoon and then probably home to rest again. I have pretty much decided to do what my body is telling me and that is rest. Does anyone go to a support group at their cancer center? I haven't been yet but I am thinking about going this evening if the weather is not too bad. i have made some friends at chemo undergoing tx for BC and it is great to share with them as it is with all of you. Is anyone else vegetarian? I started before I was diagnosed and find that I don't miss meat at all. I do eat fish on occasion. I am pretty sure that I had a high level of inflammation (arthritis in my knees etc that triggered alarm but couldn't understand what was happening to me over the past 2 years.I went to several Dr.s but never put anything together until the BC tx. I think that I was bit too easy to dismiss what my body was telling me. I hope that I never do that again. Lisa is so right in saying we need to take care of ourselves before we can really take care of others! We all need to take that advice to heart and teach it to our daughters Thanks you for being there for me. Never, ever give up hope...... Carpe Diem!!!!",

It does cause terrible bone pain and I don't blame anyone for not wanting to put anymore stuff in their bodies than is absolutely necessary. I think my onc wanted to insure that I am able to have all 6 of my treatments on schedule and that the Neulasta will help that happen. it is day 9 after my 3rd tx and I still feel awful although I confess I went out to play in the snow this morning for way too long. I am paying the price now as I am typing this from bed. yep, that's me. Carpe Diem. Cebula, I am sorry for the itch, I hope you find a solution that you can live with but the deca will stop it cold. i know how you feel, when I read the inserts and side effects of the drugs I am taking I want to freak out. The last time I went to the onc I had a long talk with her beginning with the statement that I planned on living a long time and I didn't want chronic heart, liver or other problems as a result of the drugs that I am taking now. She was receptive to my concerns and we actually discussed some things I could do to help....green tea, tumeric, vitamin e, yoga, meditation. Some of these are things that the chemo class said were a big no-no. It is not easy knowing the right thing to do, is it? It increases anxiety.......I guess we all have to make our own informed decisions which does give us a bit of control over our lives when they oftentimes seem to be completely out of our control!!!!! Thanks for letting me vent, I feel better since I know that we all share this journey and that we all experience it in our own unique way. Love and hope to us all",
