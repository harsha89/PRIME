Now my oncologist wants to run tests to see if I have Lupus.  I thought the treatment might have triggered the symptoms of Lupus.  I developed a skin condition right after I finished radiation treatment .  It is called Vitiligo.  It is an autoimmune condition which causes white blotches on my skin.  So as I research breast cancer, Lupus, Vitiligo and blood cots there seems to be a connection.  I do think I had symptoms before my cancer treatment.   Does this make sense.
