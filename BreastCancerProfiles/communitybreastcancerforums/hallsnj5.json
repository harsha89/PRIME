She came in herself to get me before I was even changed! i already had the titanium or body jewelery inside from the biopsy so you wont have to go through mammo again. They did compress to do the insertion. I can't say that I felt it at all. I had about a 2 hr.  wait for surgery and sat in a recliner with a magazine. As you can see, all of us have different experiences! I did follow the recommendations on here for keeping on a sports bra and ice for a few days. It really did help. Best of luck for all of you about to go down this road! ",

I share your fear! Are you getting 1 breast removed? I am large breasted and my BS suggested a reduction on both sides. I am leaning towards a mastectomy of one or both. This waiting and decision-making is the worst! It seems like you were able to move a little faster than me. I am waiting for appts. with a gentic oncologist (this is my 2nd cancer in a year!) and a plastic surgeon next week. I will be thinking of you and following your progress since I am right behind you. It seems that there are many strong and brave women on this sight who have survived this fight and have a lot of wisdom and foresight to offer. I find great comfort in knowing what to expect. Best of luck.",

I am a BC repeat customer and these threads helped me a lot the last time. In 2009, I had DCIS with micro invasion. When margins were not clear, I opted for BMX even though my surgeon said it was over treating. After having kidney cancer the year before, I wasn't taking any chances! I also had a hysterectomy. 2016 ended with a suspicious mammogram and after lots of tests and waiting, got that call. Seems I fall in that rare recurrance after mastectomy, Finally had surgery the end of March. I had an area of DCIS and 2 1 cm tumors removed.Then the treatment debate began. End result, I am starting 4 rounds of TC tomorrow so I am joining this ride",

Though mine was a recurrance after mastectomy for DCIS with micro invasion, I also had DCIS with 2- 1 cm IDC tumors. Seems they are treating more first occurrences with chemo now. This weekend is so much better than last weekend! I am looking forward to 2 good weeks before getting hit again! Mom angel- I understand your fear and I was right there where you are. The unexpected is the worst! I get very nauseous after surgery so I was worried about that too. Thankfully, I did fine. Some things that helped me were drinking green tea with fresh ginger, eating something small every 2 hours, and ginger candy was great! Will say a prayer for you on Monday! ",

My MO kinda snickered when I asked him about it, but said it would not do any harm. We went to lunch, I came home and crashed, got up for dinner and went out for walk. I am now waiting and wondering what will come next! Ciaci- Good luck on your PET/CT scan. I went through the same thing with insurance",

This waiting really stinks. I am having such a hard time sleeping and feel the wave come over me several times a day. This is my second go round with cancer and waiting. One thing I have learned is to use that time to do all of the research you can do, talk to others in your boat, and have a plan in mind. My first reation is to \"just get it out\" but BC has so many options. Please don't even think about not making it to see your children. I have 3 children also. Keep your thoughts to dealing with it and getting rid of it! We are lucky to live in a world with such advances that make this so beatable! Have a great weekend! Lisa",

I have also been going to float therapy (Epsom salt pool) the day that Neulasta pain kicks in. It is 1 hour of pure bliss! One question, if you had a recurrence, how did you get an Oncotype? I tried and tried and was told they won't do it for recurrance",

I keep saying to myself last time for this and last time for that. One more step done! Still have to look forward to lashes/brows coming out, hair coming back, radiation, and AIs. Thanks to the brave women who have gone before me and their honesty and openness, I was well prepared on what I could expect and how to deal with it. And yes, many respond differently. The suggestions I found most helpful were icing fingers and toes during treatment and chewing on ice, Mylanta & liquid Benadryl for mouth sores, Claritan for Neulasta, drinking lots and lots of water, keeping as active as possible, but resting when needed. Happy healing to those coming to the end and love and strength to those beginning this journey",

After reading on these boards and having a friend go through chemo ahead of me, I thought I was prepared for everything. My first chemo was 5/24. It was a long journey to get to that spot so I was mixed with fear and relief. The Benadryl had me so out of it and I was so worriedly about getting my hands and feet iced that I hardly had time to react to the fact they had started the chemo. The waiting for which side effect would hit was the worst! I was a bit queasy but never took more meds. My mouth was sore a few days and the Mylanta/liquid Benadryl really helped. I took Claritan and Naproxen but still had bad back and bone pain a few days. Haircut short, bloodwork yesterday was good, so now more waiting for hair to fall out and whatever tomorrow will bring! Have a wonderful Friday!",
