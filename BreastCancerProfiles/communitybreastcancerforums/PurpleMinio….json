As for nausea, a couple of drugs that have been helpful to me are Emend and Kytril. I got no relief from Zofran and in fact suffered terrible headaches while taking that. Compazine works as a breakthrough med for me but the side effects (dizziness and fatigue) make me use that sparingly.

My doctor thinks that we will see results quickly if we are going to see results, because I've just had immunotherapy that he believes will enhance the effectiveness of the gem/carb. I am only getting it every three weeks, I have read that some people get another boost of gem on the second week but we aren't doing that. Have you had any fevers? I read that with gemzar that can happen the day after? Thanks again for sharing your experience.

It's kind of rainy and dreary here so that helps, a stay in and watch movies kind of day today for sure. I hope everyone is well, welcome to the newcomers. Catch you more later when I have more time (and energy)! ",

I have already made an extra copy of the above forms and highlighted what needs to still be filled in on the forms after I die. I've already put everything and all bills in husband's name and so in addition to the above he will only need to contact automobile insurance, motor vehicle office, and bank. We don't owe anything now. I've already given away all my possessions except my gold band of wedding ring and it will be on my finger, my clothes & shoes will be donated to Goodwill, and everything in my bathroom drawers shower will be trashed. Could it be any easier for DH? ha! I've said all along God really knows me, He knows how organized I am and how important it would be to me to make this as pain-free for DH as possible and for that am truly grateful. ADDING MORE TO THE BAG / ABOVE LIST (from others' input, along with some more ideas that have come to mind that could be helpful): \u2022List of all banking/etc account numbers and passwords. \u2022Letters ready for all 3 credit bureaus to be mailed after my death so that my credit files are closed down - preventing identity theft. Letters are written and envelopes addressed and stamped but not sealed - have a post it note on each to add a photo copy of death certificate to each envelope before sealing. \u2022What you wish to happen to your pets. A relative or friend that is willing to take on your pet and have all of the pets papers (immunizations etc) and your notes on pets habits/likes/dislikes together in an envelope with contact information for the relative/friend. \u2022If having a funeral, photos of yourself with family & friends you want displayed at the funeral. Perhaps also have them scanned to a CD for online memorials. You can also make it a slide-show to your favorite music. \u2022If having funeral, list of your favorite music and burn a CD of those. \u2022If having funeral, a photo of yourself that you like the best for the funeral parlor to do your makeup and hair the way you like it. \u2022If having funeral, a 'how you want to be remembered' statement or a poem, etc you'd like read at your funeral. \u2022If choosing cremation, state where and when (you can pick a special day & time) that you would your ashes scattered. Or you can have your urn of ashes buried if you like. \u2022If choosing cremation, have a special urn made (penny4cats did this and will share websites about it), or you could make it yourself at a pottery place. If plan to bury the ashes, find a wooden box that fits the urn for this purpose. \u2022Any special friends or medical team members you want to thank, get some blank inside cards and write a note to them and have the addressed and place a forever stamp on them (so you don't have to worry about postage changes). \u2022If you have jewelry you want to go to certain people, give it to them now or on a special day in the near future, and tell them about the piece (who gave it to you, when, where, what it's meant to you), this is the same with anything really, give it now so that the recipient will remember that \"you\" gave it to them rather than you 'left' it to them. \u2022Don't forget your recipes - pass them on...maybe even make special recipe cards with \"from the kitchen of (your name)\" so that they will carry on forever. Whatever you add to the bag, don't forget to add it to the list for your DH/loved one-in-charge (i.e., mail cards, mail letters to credit bureaus, take CD of music & photos to funeral home, etc). ****Also reposting these added items.... Someone may have already mentioned this, but just thought of it when updating a few addresses. Add this to you When I Die Bag: \u2022Complete list of everyone you want contacted when your gone, with their name and phone number and address. We often have friends that our family and other friends have never met. After passing, notification phone calls are made by family members or friends and having the address will help the family with thank you cards if needed. Also, if someone on your list has a name that is pronounced different then it sounds, write a note in parenthesis beside their name how to say it; i.e. Aja Jones (pronounced Asia). \u2022Complete email addresses for notification of your death (if you have friends that you have only ever communicated by email and never met). Put these into a word document so they can be copied & pasted into a email To line. (Or put on a USB jump drive for your bag). \u2022If you're going to have a USB jump drive, make an index for what items are on it and what the items are for. Print the index and place the index & the jump drive in a zip lock bag or if you do a notebook like I did, you can use a 3-ring binder pencil holder. \u2022You can scan in and save documents in pdf format and then save those to the jump drive, just in case anything gets misplaced there will be a electronic copy of it. Recommend using a separate jump drive for the photos and or music you want at your funeral, just so your private documents don't accidentally land on the memorial slide-show. \u2022Someone posted before that sending out thank you cards after funeral was too hard or never got around to it. In my small home town paper, I've seen a small business card size ad written by families to thank everyone for their prayers, flowers, cards, kindness, etc. Your family history with all that you know...(such as maternal aunt died age 39 with breast cancer spread to lungs, paternal aunt died age 44 with uterine cancer, paternal grandmotherdied 93 after complication from fractured hip/osteoperosis and she had diabetes and HBP....)

TOPIC: FUNERAL & CREMATION PRICING Most funeral homes are high for any services and way overcharge for caskets. You can actually order your own casket from the internet if you want. Direct cremation is approx $600 plus memorial services about $1200&up. You can Google search \"direct cremation\" or \"direct burial\" if you want a casket in your city to find less expensive places than funeral homes. Many of these websites provide pricing for all to see, while others require to fill out and submit. I don't fill out any online, I just look up and call to ask questions without giving my personal information. I already have all the forms ready (except of course for date of death and place of death) and in a binder with pocketed tabs kept in my 'When I Die Bag' hanging in my closet as described in my previous topic. NEPTUNE SOCIETY: The Neptune Society is nationwide and offers a free guide with any and everything you want to know about cremation. www.neptunesociety.com/ These may have changed.

The 9 community property states are: Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin. \"Right of survivorship\" - this is what protects a spouse from being kicked out of their home after the death of the other. The following is a copy/paste directly from the website FindLaw.com and it's easy understanding of the differences: (see link to website below) Who owns what property in a marriage, after divorce, or after a spouse's death depends on whether the couple lives in a common law property state or a community property state. During marriage, these classifications may seem trivial, but in the unfortunate events of divorce or death, these details become very important. Common Law Property States Most states are common law property states. So, what does it mean to live in a common law property state? The term \"common law\" is simply a term used to determine the ownership of marital property (property acquired during marriage). The common law system provides that property acquired by one member of a married couple is owned completely and solely by that person. Of course, if the title or deed to a piece of property is put in the names of both spouses, however, then that property would belong to both spouses. If both spouses' names are on the title, each owns a one-half interest. Example: If Wife buys a car and puts it only in her name, that car belongs to only Wife. If Wife buys a car and puts it in her name and Husband's name, then the car belongs to both of them. Property distribution upon death or separation: When one spouse passes away, his or her separate property is distributed according to his or her will, or according to probate, without a will. The distribution of the marital property depends on how the spouses share ownership. If they own property in \"joint tenancy with the right of survivorship\" or \"tenancy by the entirety\", the property goes to the surviving spouse. This right is independent of what the deceased spouse's will says. However, if the property was owned as \"tenancy in common\", then the property can go to someone other than the surviving spouse, per the deceased spouse's will. Not all property has a title or deed. In this case, generally, whoever paid for the property or received it as a gift owns it. If the couple divorces or obtains a legal separation, the court will decide how the marital property will be divided. Of course, the couple can enter into an agreement before the marriage, explaining how to distribute the marital property upon divorce. Community Property States The states having community property are Louisiana, Arizona, California, Texas, Washington, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, and Wisconsin. Community property states follow the rule that all assets acquired during the marriage are considered \"community property\". Marital property in community property states are owned by both spouses equally (50/50). This marital property includes earnings, all property bought with those earnings, and all debts, accrued during the marriage. Community property begins at the marriage and ends when the couple physically separates with the intention of not continuing the marriage. So, any earnings or debts originating after this time will be separate property. Any assets acquired before the marriage are considered separate property, and are owned only by that original owner. A spouse can, however, transfer the title of any of his or her separate property to the other spouse (gift) or to the community property (making a spouse an account holder on bank account). Spouses can also comingle their separate property with community property, for example, by adding funds from before the marriage to the community property funds. Spouses may not transfer, alter, or eliminate any whole piece of community property without the other spouse's permission. A spouse can manage his or her own half the way he wishes, but the whole piece includes the other spouse's one half interest. In other words, that spouse cannot be alienated from his or her one half. Separate property includes \u2022Property owned by just one spouse before the marriage \u2022Property given to just one spouse before or during the marriage \u2022Property inherited by just one spouse Community property includes \u2022Money either spouse earned during the marriage \u2022Things bought with money either spouse earned during the marriage \u2022Separate property that has become so mixed with community property that it can't be identified Example: Wife and Husband have been married for ten years. Wife works as a successful doctor and uses her earnings to buy a car. That car is community property, and both Husband and Wife own the car equally. Example: Husband owns a valuable piece of antique furniture that he acquired before the marriage. Husband alone owns the antique as his separate property. The antique is not community property, because it was acquired before the marriage. If Husband wants to give his wife a one half interest in the antique, he may; then, the antique would be part of the community property. Property distribution upon death or separation: When one spouse passes away, his or her half of the community property passes to the surviving spouse. Their separate property can be devised to whomever they wish according to their will, or via probate without a will. Many community property states offer an interest called \"community property with the right of survivorship\". Under this doctrine, if a couple holds title or deed to a piece of property, usually a home, then upon a spouse's death, title passes automatically to the surviving spouse, avoiding court proceedings. If the couple divorces or obtains a legal separation, all of the community property is divided evenly (50/50). The separate property of each spouse is distributed to the spouse who owns it and is not divided according to the 50/50 rule. Sometimes, economic circumstances warrant awarding certain assets wholly to one spouse, but each spouse still ends up with 50% of all community property in terms of total economic value. This is most common regarding marital homes. Since it is not feasible to divide a house in half, often the court will award one spouse the house, and the other spouse receives other assets that's value is equal to half the value of the home. Before the marriage, the couple may enter into an agreement that lays out how the marital property should be divided upon divorce. Exceptions to the equal division rule: \u2022One spouse misappropriates the community property, whether before or during a pending divorce. \u2022One spouse has incurred educational debts. This is the same as separately incurred debt. On divorce, the spouse takes his or her GSL loans with him or her. \u2022One spouse incurred tort liability NOT based on activity for the benefit of the marital community. \u2022A personal injury award is community property during the marriage, but on divorce is awarded to the injured spouse. \u2022\"Negative community\" refers to a situation where the community liabilities and debts exceed the available assets to pay the liabilities and debts. Here, the relative ability of spouses to pay the debt is considered. The interest here is to protect creditors. http://family.findlaw.com/marriage/what-s-mine-is-mine-what-s-yours-is-mine-who-owns-what-in.html Another website with easy-understandable language on this same topic is: http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/marriage-property-ownership-who-owns-what-29841.html bco sister since 2008, rejoined 2012.

Most Hospice of the Valley patients are served in their own homes. Some are cared for in group homes, assisted living or skilled nursing facilities. Hospice inpatient units also are available for patients whose symptoms can't be managed at home. It is appropriate to discuss all care options, including hospice, at any time during a life-limiting illness. The decision belongs to the patient. Hospice of the Valley staff members are available to help with the discussion. View \"When is it Time.\" The patient and family should feel free to discuss hospice care at any time with their physician, other healthcare professionals, clergy and friends. If your physician is not familiar with hospice, invite him or her to call us or ask us to contact your physician. Hospice of the Valley functions as an extension of, not in place of, the patient's attending physician. The agency also has medical directors available Valleywide to help patients who have no physician or need physician home visits. If the patient's condition improves, the patient can be discharged from hospice and return to getting regular treatment. If a discharged patient elects to return later to hospice care, that's also ok. Medicare allows people to go on and off hospice as needed. Hospice of the Valley does nothing to speed up or slow down the dying process. Just as doctors and midwives lend support and expertise during the time of childbirth, so hospice provides its presence and specialized knowledge during the natural dying process. Hospice care is for people with a life-limiting illness who want comfort care rather than curative treatment. A physician must certify that the person's life expectancy is six months or less, but that time frame is flexible. Services can be extended beyond six months. Some people go on and off hospice care as their conditions change. Some people \"graduate\" from hospice because they get better. It is time to consider hospice care when one or more of these circumstances apply: loss of function or physical decline; increase in hospitalizations; dependence in most activities of daily living; multiple diseases or conditions; increase in emergency room visits, and continuing weight loss. In addition, each disease has its own criteria indicating hospice eligibility. For example, dementia or Alzheimer's disease is a terminal illness that can run its course over a decade. Hospice eligibility occurs when the person with dementia exhibits one or more of the following: unable to walk without assistance, incontinence, speech limited to a few words, difficulty swallowing or eating, and continuing weight loss. Anyone can contact Hospice for help to decide whether hospice care is appropriate. TOPIC: WAKE / VIEWING & OBITUARIES Funerals are setup with various ways of having services for viewing. This topic is just going to be a casual how it is for my family and then to make ya'll laugh when you get the obituaries. Still food-for-thought and to help you to consider how yours will be or how you want it to be, declare your wishes. In the south we call the viewing \"Wake\" the day or night before the burial usually. Then the day of burial there is a funeral service with the minister, speeches, and music with one last pass by the casket by all, before we go outside and wait by the hearse. If the cemetery is behind the funeral home, we all walk out there to the grave site -or- if cemetery is elsewhere, we get in our cars and get in line for the funeral procession to cemetery. At the Wake, there is no receiving line but the front row of seats/pews or a boxed area are set up for just the family near the casket for when they want to be sitting there. They are the last to walk in view before going outside. Our Wakes always seemed to me like a social gathering, there are tears from time to time but mostly just family & friends talking about what happened and then catching up on things. See people you haven't seen in forever and a day. We wonder around and talk to everybody and always go look at the flower arrangements and read the cards. I usually wait til end of day and the burial day to view the body, that's just my thing. Finger food and drinks in the funeral home kitchen is always there and when someone brings in a plate, we all notice and they get extra hugs from everyone there. Our Wake usually only last 2-4 hours but I've seen them last all day. Unlike burial day, not all dress in black for the Wake, some do but most don't. People come in and out throughout the time period of the Wake. The day of burial not near as many people show up as they do to the Wake and everybody's wearing black, the mood is total opposite than the Wake everybody is somber because this is it, it's the end, goodbye. After the burial, we head to one's house and food shows up all day from family & friends dropping by and slowly the mood falls somewhere between how it was at the Wake and somber. No one wants to be the first to leave, I think we're all wishing we could always be together. When planning one's funeral, think about what its like, is it what \"you\" want, is it worth the expense of it, etc. Remember the funeral homes make more the more hours it is. I've sat through with a friend that their family was talked into to getting the 8-hour Wake two days in a row and it was exhausting for them. Photo boards on an easel are popular at Wakes. You can have one the family prepared for the wake and another for friends to bring in a photo of them with the deceased. I like the friends ones because it changes through the day, some bring and copy and leave it and others leave it up while they are there and then take it home with them. If you're going to have a viewing, open casket, keep in your 'When I Die Bag' a photo of yourself where you makeup and hair are the way you like it best and for your loved one to give the funeral home for prepping your body....and just in case bald at the time, your favorite wig or wig & scarf. OBITUARIES: I recommend everybody write their own ahead of time or with someone so they know who you want to mention. Many newspapers post a simple obituary free, but personal written obituaries cost. A lot of funeral homes offer free obituary on their websites with ability for friends & family to post condolences. Or charge a fee for a memorial page with photos and music. Here comes my southern humor and just something I posted before and funny to me, but it's still food-for-thought when planning: In my hometown, families want to all have 'their' names mentioned in the obit and oh my goodness, don't leave out one and mention another, you won't hear the end of it and then they do tit for tat and next obit, the one left out leaves out the one that left them out, ha ha! It's hilarious really. That's why I recommend write your own. I don't want an obit at all and it's in my wishes. I remember my mom said she wanted to write mine...uh, no thanks, it'll start a war with leaving out names.ha! It's too late, if it doesn't make to the original don't bother trying to fix it they still won't forget, ha ha. Also the photo boards that are put up at the wake, make sure not to forget photos of all...one time at the wake it became so upsetting to some family members that their pictures weren't there that they went and made their own board, bigger with more pics and brought it in and set it in front of the other one...this is cracking me up to even write this now, because when it happened I'm looking and thinking 'really' and it's hard not to chuckle about it thinking back, but they are so serious and I'm just so glad not to be involved in it. TOPIC: DWD - DEATH WITH DIGNITY PLEASE VERIFY ALL - this is not medical or legal advise. Did some research on DWD \"Death with Dignity\" in Oregon (which appears to also be available in Washington and Vermont and similar in Montana with physician assist) This year 2016, California may go in effect according to some websites. DWD rules, Patient must: \u2022be 18 years or older. \u2022make oral/verbal request twice, with a 15 days separation in between requests. \u2022make written request to their Physician and with two witnesses. \u2022be within 6 months of expected end of life - confirmed by Physician with diagnosis and prognosis (terminally ill 6mos or less). \u2022be in full decision making capacity for their own affairs. No family member can request this for patient. If doctors feel patient's judgment is impaired, patient will be referred for psychiatric evaluation first. \u2022be provided with understanding of alternatives (hospice, pain control, comfort care) by their Physician. \u2022notify their next of kin. \u2022be a resident of the state proven with driver license, tax return, voter registration, (can't just go there to do it, but you can move there and then do it after prove resident but there is no 'minimum' time of residency) \u2022be able to self-administer DWD drug. \u2022not be in a hospital, nursing care or hospice type facility. The lethal medication (oral dosage of barbiturate) will then be prescribed to patient to be taken by patient when patient is ready. Doctor must be MD or DO and \"practicing the Act\" (some don't such as Catholic Health and Veterans/VA). If patients doctor does not practice the Act, patient may find another doctor that does. Out-of-state doctors may not prescribe. Doctor is not allowed to administer directly to patient and is not required to be present when patient does take it. Doctor will only be present if it is the patient's wish. DWD does not constitute suicide, mercy killing or homicide under the law. DWD does not effect your life insurance, health insurance, accident insurance or annuity. The cost for DWD rx is not set by law. Oregon medicaid (which is mostly funded by federal) can only use state funds to pay for DWD drug. Some private insurance may cover it. AGAIN, PLEASE VERIFY ALL - this is just what I found and is not medical or legal advise - do not make decision based on this post.",

I watched a showtime series \"time of death\" early on in my diagnosis (which was less than a year ago but it seems like this has been my whole life somehow). It was helpful and disturbing. It was done with care and dignity. It *might* be a good thing to see, or it might be too upsetting, just mentioning it as it does address that question of what actually happens. http://www.sho.com/sho/time-of-death/home (edited to correct the show title and add the link) ",
