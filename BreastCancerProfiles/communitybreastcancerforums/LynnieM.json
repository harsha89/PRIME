My husband was a great support for me yesterday -- he took great care of me (okay, I might of took alittle advantage of the situation).  My boss told me not to come to work today -- called him  this morning (male), he has been really concerned -- had me laughing on the phone.  I told my husband that the machine they use first had me concerned, but the numbing meds were greatly appreciated -- all I felt was pressure.  The female rad had trouble getting through the tissue and kept apolozing -- but got sample.  Watched the whole procedure on the screen, which to me was a comfort.  The second hard nodule turned out to be a blood filled cyct.  I left yesterday with the feeling it is going to be okay, no matter what!!!!!",
