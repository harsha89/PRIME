You have a great outline, NPat. The 3 items I came up with are prevention (e.g.,raise arm above heart level whenever possible, no constrictive clothing or jewelry, etc.), management (e.g., compression sleeves, drug tx, pain mgt, etc.), and complications (e.g., skin breakdown, etc.). I've worked in general oncology floors in 2 hospitals in the past and lymphedema was never mentioned in any of our in-service lectures. I'm now working in hematology at a well-known cancer center and we occasionally get BC patients with LE. Know what? I'm gonna start with them and I'll do the LE in-service when I get back to work. Thanks for giving me the idea.",
