She said, this scheme is not approved in Germany but is currently being tested in the US in trials. To me, this scheme seems very promising!",

      "Content": "Apr 21, 2010 02:59PM - edited Apr 21, 2010 03:02PM by susaloh I spontaneously rang Astra Zeneca to ask about the double dose! I thought, as it´s a very large company, they wouldn´t bother with normal people ringing them but I tried anyway. And actually today, this scientist or study doctor rang me back. My question was, what if someone had already started on the lower dose, would it still be a good idea to switch to the higher dose. Well, of course she said, they can´t answer the question, there is no data - how could there be, for the trials they always take the straight forward cases. She said I should talk with my onc but she thought it would depend on whether I was doing well on my current dosis or not.I found interesting that she also said that the existing tumor load wasn´t really related to the effectiveness of dosage. This Friday I will know my current Ca 15-3 value. It might be hard to tell at this stage whether Faslodex is doing a good job because my tumor marker might be falling anyway, because since I had the ovarectomie (where they took out the main met) my estrogen and progesterone which had skyrocketed obviously now plummeted to very low figures. As to the Ca 15-3, it fell from the highest point 37,5 just before the operation down to 28 on the day of my first injection ten days later, and four weeks on was down to 18. If it is down to 10 or so this time (wouldn´t that be marvellous!!!!!) that would mean that I am basically down to NED so couldn´t do any better. But if it´s higher or just the same I will try to convince my onc to switch to the double dose..... Life is full of suspense (I could do without, really) once you´ve got mets.....",

I´d been happy enough with the Tamoxifen but now I´m even happier because I´ve got even fewer side effects from Faslodex. For example, inspite of very cold Feburary and March no more problems with dry eyes and sore nose (also from dryness). I am interested to see that some of you have already received the double dose. I only learned about this possibility recently - apparently the 500mg dose was approved for the German market Germany on 21 March. Bad luck, if I had known about this earlier I would have insisted to get the larger dose - if it brings another three month on average, I want those three months. Don´t know if it´s too late now and not worth upping the dose",

      "Content": "Feb 28, 2010 08:45AM - edited Feb 28, 2010 08:45AM by susaloh Hi Lynne, I am sorry that you´ve had such dramatic reactions to Xeloda. How very annoying, when you put all your hopes in this treatment. Hopefully they´ll get it under control!  I´m afraid I can´t really help you with your question even though I was given Xeloda as first line therapy as part of a study and I experienced h/f syndrome, but only after two or three weeks. But I wanted to write to you anyhow because our situations are quite similar just for the fact that we´ve both got lobular BC with mets to organs. I didn´t have mets from the start as far as I know but I had a very large tumor and also many (all) nodes affected. Apparently Tamoxifen didn´t work well with me because I was now diagnosed with mets to the ovaries, one of them again very large (8 cm - and I didn´t feel a thing!). They took out my ovaries but left behind a large number of probably cancerous abdominal nodes. There are also some very small suspicious areas in my lungs and in my bones. They rechecked receptor status on the material which was taken out and found it was still hormone sensitive (ER: IRS 6 (was 9 to begin with) and PR: IRS 6 in one area, IRS 1 in another, used to be 9 as well). So I was now started on Faslodex and Zometa. I am so hoping that it will keep the cancer at bay at least for a while. Lobular is meant to be very hormone dependant, I don´t quite get how this whole thing works. My question to you: if your cancer is progressing, does that mean, Femara is not working for you? Are you continuing to get Femara while being on Xeloda? How did they find the two nodes you mention? Is this now your first chemo? If you like, tell me some more about your situation! Best wishes!

I notice a huge effect on how sore I get depending on where they make the injection. If they put it in higher, closer to the hip, there is less of a lump, and less itching later.  I sometimes wonder whether it matters where exactly they put the shot.  How come you´re getting the Dasitinib? are you in a study? Nobody here in Germany seems to get these new tyrokinase inhibitors.  ",
