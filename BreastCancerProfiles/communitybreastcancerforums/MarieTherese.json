I was told that I do not have a mass, but that the tissues are pulling and distorted? There is no lump, but there seems to be any area of concern and I have to have an ultra sound guided core needle biopsy next week. The area of concern is less than 1cm long and .5cm wide. They asked me several times if I had had a car accident or trauma to that breast and I have not that I can recall. I do have a history of benign cysts and saw several of them floating by on the U/S. ( the tech confirmed that they were cysts) I am 48 with no family history of breast cancer, but my mother also has dense breast tissue, cystic breasts and has gone for at 3 or 4 biopsies that were all negative. The radiologist was so vague and I just couldn't think of what to ask. The more I read online, the more confused I get. Are there any questions that I should be asking the day of the biopsy? I have a ton of them of course, but what can they actually tell you? Can I ask to see the images and have them explained to me? Any advice would be greatly appreciated as I am in absolute shock and do not know how to process any of this.
