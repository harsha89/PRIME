He's pretty sure its cancer but which one he doesn't know It seems they are leaning towards breast cancer mets. I just want to get started if I need treatment. I feel like a sitting duck. ",

She suspects mets to lung and possibly a spot on my spine. The mass in my lung is about 7mm. Just wondering if anyone has had a mass that size with it being mets and was there any other parts of the body affected? I'm just terrified of the unknown. I hope I have the strength for my boys. If there is any encouraging words out there I could sure use them now. thank you thank you PIP Log in to post a reply",

Just a routine CT scan of lung for blood clots and an x ray. sadly the X ray showed one spot one my spine and CT scan shows mass size of a nickle on my lung. I cant think of anything but this all day everyday. Then Had bone scan shows the same spot on spine and lung mass Had CT scan for abdomen nothing else showed up. Finally got an appointment for lung biopsy this Thursday. I have a feeling my life will never be the same. But I feel healthy so I don't get it. Besides the extreme stress I'm fine. Has anyone gone through this or going through this? How is one to live day to day normally and can I ? the people around me say I'm strong but After losing my parent to cancer not too long ago and then my Breast cancer 2017 I am tapped out. Can radiologist know the difference between lung scarring and a lung mass? When I was 18 I had a cancerous tumor behind my heart, I had chemo and radiation back in 1982 chemo was horrible. But I beat the odds on that cancer, Yes my body seems to create cancer but I'm still here. I come on this sight everyday and read post it makes me sad but hopefully. My doctor took me off Tamoxifen 5 days ago and I'm to start Letrozole need to call her tomorrow for that info. thanks for listening (reading) Pip Log in to post a reply",

I was told by someone at Pfizer( some supervisor) Friday that Ibrance probably wont be covered by our drug company. I was just told I have mets officially last week then had to hear that. I dont think she realized how insensitive she was being That night was my first 3 hour long breakdown. I know my breakdown was probably inevitable but she shouldnt have told me she thinks its not covered. Paperwork wasnt even put in yet by my doctor. I know looks like I'm got my hopes up about Ibrance but I feel it could be the right fit for me. Just hope I can get on it pip",

I had a hard time on these pills from the get go. I went on them for a month then told to get off them for a couple of weeks and start them again but my body did not like them. So went off then started on Tamoxifen a month later. On Jan 22 a routine CT scan they found a mass on my lung and a spot on my spine. Just went last week for Lung Biopsy my doctor is bracing me for the worst. I have so many question and now trying to learn the breast cancer terminology.Waiting is the worst started Jan 22 and by March 19 I will know my fate. So many thoughts running in my head I wish I could stop thinking of this for 1 minute. I'm not telling people just my husband and sister. This forum helps. I hate change. For the last 6 years each year my family has lost someone to lung cancer. I'm much younger and don't smoke but the thought is still there. I need a happy moment pip",

My oncologist believes it is breast cancer mets that has gone to my lung but we are waiting for the pathology report. So if nothing showed up on the CT scans other than lung would the PET scan show anything? Also the ct scan of my brain showed nothing would a MRI show more.? All this waiting is horrible I feel that the longer we wait the more the lung mass is growing. Now Im witing for an appointment for PET scan and MRI Thank you Pip Log in to post a reply",
