Not sure if this is normal for it to drag out so long or not but again nothing has been normal for me.  Just wondering if I was alone with this or not....and, with the hair issue wondered when to expect the fallout....it bald thing doesn't bother me just like to have an idea of when to expect it... I'm the first Halaven patient my Onc has had....  Thanks for any input at all....{HUGS}",

I guess because I'm not a walking skeleton it's not a serious issue. I love it when people who have never been down this road say they know how you feel. Well, I wouldn't wish this on anyone but till  you walk in our shoes you don't know how I feel...Sorry to sound so negative, just letting off steam...HUGS TO ALL",
