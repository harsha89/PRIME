I don't think it is irrational that I feel so worried considering I have lost 30lbs in the last few months, have been having really bad neck/back pain for months, and because of how big my tumor/s is and how long I have had it and because lymph nodes are involved. I am not the type of person people would consider an example of a strong person. When the going gets tough the tough get going... AND I? Well I, I, climb in bed, get incredibly depressed, and feel paralyzed and hopeless. I have struggled with severe anxiety and depression my entire life and it is difficult to make the most out of everyday and be productive even when my emotional issues are under some control. Knowing this, I don't see me thriving and surviving or having the kind of attitude that I need to maybe beat cancer (if it is Stage lll) or make the most of the life I have left if I have Stage lV. Waiting for my mammogram and sonogram, waiting for my pathology results from my biopsy, and now still terrifed and waiting for my scans I have been spending all my free time in bed, not eating. I only get up to feed my dogs and walk them. If it is hard to do that how am I going to beat cancer? I have insurance (Medicare, thankfully from my struggle with depression and anxiety) so that I am really thankful for, but there will still be lots to pay. I had been doing real good emotionally and thought this would be the year I was finally able to support myself (I have been slowly but surely getting loan signings and started driving for Uber and Lyft) and now I don't know what I will be able to continue doing. So that is more to be sad about. Right when I thought my life was finally getting better. Anyway. I'm really scared and struggling. Michelle Log in to post a reply",

Here is the link to my first post on the \"waiting for results\" board. https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/62/topics... I don't know yet the ER,PR, HEP-2, or ki67 status. I have a Grade 2 tumor/s and they are intraducular carcinoma, infiltrative. I was told I am maybe a Stage lll (maybe 2). I will start chemo next week and I won't get my mastectomy until I am done with chemo because the tumor is so large and lymph nodes are involved. I will be getting a breast MRI next week to get a better look at the tumor/s and also a PET/CT scan next week to see if it has spread. I will update you when I know more Log in to post a reply",
