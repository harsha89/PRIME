      "Content": "MoodyMoo wrote: I'm trying to determine how \"common\" it might be to have one diagnosis from a core needle biopsy, and then a different diagnosis from an excisional biopsy from the same site.  On May 2nd, I had 2 stereotactic biopsies, both due to suspicious microcalcifications.  Site B had no atypia or malignancy, but Site A had FEA and LCIS.  Recommendation was for an excisional biopsy on Site A.  A follow up MRI didn't identify any additonal areas of concern in either breast. On May 31st, I had an excisional biopsy on Site A.  They found two foci of ADH, with no mention of LCIS or FEA.  While I suppose it's possible that the CNB completely removed the LCIS, I just find that strange.  My BS didn't have a great answer for me as well.  She just confirmed that due to both diagnoses that I am considered high risk, even since I have none of the other familial high risk indicators. Have you all experienced anything similar?  I guess I've got of different things going on in that small space, and wasn't certain how normal that was...  TIA...MoodyMoo Dx: 5/9/12 - LCIS, ALH, & FEA; 6/11/12 - ADH (My alphabet soup...)
