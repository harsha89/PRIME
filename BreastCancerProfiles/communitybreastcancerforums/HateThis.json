They did find a very small solid nodule on my left breast that they suspect is benign. That worries me a little but they said it didn't even show up on the mammogram and I'm supposed to go back in six months for another ultrasound so they can monitor it. I will absolutely positively keep that appointment and will get yearly mammograms from now on!! Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart to all of you for supporting me thru this. I feel like I've been given a second chance at life. :)",

My 15 year old daughter is sitting here talking about what her ideal wedding will be like.... and all I can think is \"I may not be around to see it.\" Thanks darnette...it did take so much strength to leave my marriage, especially since I was a stay at home mom for 16 years and had to get a full time job and live on my own for the first time. I've been on my own since July 2011. This last year has been the most stressful of my whole life. Not sure I can take much more. But this makes all of my other problems seem completely insignificant.",

I asked to get in early because I'm going on vaca on Thursday and didn't wanna wait til next week. They fit me in but said if I need an ultrasound they can't do it today. My gp felt the lump and said it was firm but it could still be a cyst. She looked at the dimpling and said to her it looked like normal aging skin (?). I was happy to be told my boobs are probably just saggy. Lol. I need all the positive vibes I can get. I guess I won't know anything today but I'm relieved to just get started on the testing.",

      "Content": "HateThis wrote: I don't want to be here. But I know none of us do. I'm 45. Have only gotten one mammo. At least 5 yrs ago. I was just too overwhelmed with life and busy to fit it in. I kept putting it on my to do list but never getting to it. I realize now how incredibly STUPID that was. I hate myself. :( Found a lump in my right breast a few days ago. It's pretty large. At least an inch I would say. It's not super hard but not soft. Doesn't move very much. Its not perfectly round. Sort of oval or oblong. I kept thinking ok...most lumps are benign. I made an appt with my gp. They couldn't see me til Tuesday. I was worried but I thought maybe its nothing. Then I started researching. A while ago, maybe 6 months ago, I noticed that my left breast ( the one without the lump) was looking a little different. I had NO IDEA that what I was looking at was dimpling under the breast and a sign of cancer. I thought it was just because I was getting older and things were sagging more. It almost looks like mild cellulite and when I raise my arms it is more pronounced. Started reading more. Inspecting more. Noticed when I move a certain way I have a dimple under my right breast below the lump. Also noticed that oh yeah - my nipples have been looking a little weird lately. When I take off my bra they are kind of flattened. Not all the way in but definitely more sinking than before. Especially my right side. Again, I had just thought it was normal aging. Have had discharge in both nipples for many years. Used to be yellowish then turned light green and then dark green. I've told the doctors but they all said its normal. Now I feel like my right breast and nipple hurts but it could be cause I'm focusing on it so much or cause I've been poking at it. I'm separated and in the middle of a divorce and still on his health insurance. I don't want to be stuck staying married to him for his insurance. My work doesn't offer insurance. I've been researching individual plans. I feel like I should get new insurance before my dr appt. because right now as far as I know I don't have a pre existing condition. As of next week that will probably change. For the first time in my life I'm happy. I left my husband of 20 years because our marriage was awful. I have a wonderful boyfriend I've been with since January. I hope I don't have to throw him into this situation. I know I have all the classic symptoms. But is there ANYTHING else it can be? I should also mention that I have not gotten my period since may. I'm not pregnant. Just had blood work because of that and everything was normal. Could it possibly some kind of premenopausal condition? I know I'm reaching for any small bit of hope... Thanks for reading this long long post. I can think of nothing else except this. I am truly terrified. I have 4 kids who I love with all my heart and I can't imagine going through this. I have such respect for all of you who have had to deal with this and my heart goes out to you. Log in to post a reply",
