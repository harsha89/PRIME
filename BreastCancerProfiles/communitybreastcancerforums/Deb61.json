I start my chemo 4-29 A/C x4 then Taxol x12 one week apart. I am so scared and feel so alone I would like to find someone in a similar situation who could go thru this with me. Is anyone out there I could talk too? My life has changed so drastically in 6 wks time. First the lump, the biopsy, the bilateral mastectomy, the bone scan, MRI, blood tests and now chemo. My head is spinning. Life as I knew it is over- it's a new world now. Doctors and needles yuck. Please tell me I am not alone. Deb",

I have teenagers and I have been very open and honest with them about everything that is happening to me. They seem ok but I don't want my illness to interfere with their well-being. I worry so much about my treatments and side effects messing up my whole family's routine. I don't want them to be unhappy and I don't want to burden anyone to take care of me. My husband is extremely supportive but I know from personal experience how difficult it can be to be in the caretakerÂ position.",
