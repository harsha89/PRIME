And the only reason would be because they found HPV on a pap I had 3 years ago. No worries the HPV went away. I have no Idea how but it did.  What are the reasons for lumps to just happen in a breast? Oh Im 33 and have had 5 kids. My youngest is 3 so its been a Very long time since I last breast feed. If anyone has any thought they would be greatly appreciated. Thanks Log in to post a reply",
