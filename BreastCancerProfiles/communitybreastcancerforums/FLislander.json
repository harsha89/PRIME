I bought a surgery camisole from TLCdirect.org it has pockets for drains and Velcro front, priceless! took button up pajama and when they took IV out at hospital I got to wear my own pajamas, so nice. I took two travel size pillows for ride home, sat on one to cushion bumps and put one between seat belt, and used them at home to prop my arms. Miralax finally worked day 4. The anticipation is much worse than surgery, once you get to hospital things go smoothly right back and on feel good meds and stay on them the whole time. Velcro belt for drains in shower would be the thing I didn't get that I would have. The month before thinking about it was much worse than the actual surgery!!!",

I'm having a hard time since I took the last chemo, at least when I was on tx I was focused, sick maybe, but had a goal just getting through. Now I'm through and I don't have the great feeling I was expecting. Into the unknown, hoping it worked. Surgery maybe will give a little more closure, I did chemo b4 surgery. So the first week of April I will move into surgery land and hope for the best. Hope everybody had a great weekend and enjoy some springtime. Maybe I'll go get a few plants for the porch. Thank you to the dec. Forum for pulling me through everyday the past 4 months, hard to believe 16 weeks. Thanks to everybody, what a great group we have, couldn't have done it without you guys!",

My kids are feeling it now with the emotions running wild and DH just doesn't know what to. The eyelashes and brows are going now and almost worse feeling than hair, just trying to get through one more month. Now onc is trying to lower pain meds because of Florida laws and I really don't think that applies to cancer patients, just venting..
