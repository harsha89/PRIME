That is why you need follow-up mammos. I was diagnosed with cancer in 1998. I had the lump removed, took radiation and 5 years of tamoxifen. I had a recurrance in 2004 that spread to the liver.  Took 33 chemo and was clear for 2-1/2 yrs.  Came back in liver last November.  After 14 more chemo, I am clear.  I was ready to have a double mastectomy but the surgeon told me it wasn't in the breast, it just came from the breast.  I have another CT scan in October. ",
