Well my world was rocked upside down yesterday when the radiologist said I wasn't the best candidate but certainly a candidate for partial breast radiation. They insert a balloon type device in your breast and you do radiation 2x per day for 6 days and then you are done. Well after having to make a split second decision because it has to be done now due to surgery scars and it will be right before chemo on the 24th and my head is spinning. I have to do more tests and it is set for next Wednesday so far. So August will be one killer of a month if it all goes through but the thought of being done hopefully by Christmas..amazing! Keep you posted. Hugs to everyone today especially those going through it!",

Barbara Delinsky the fiction writer and fellow BC survivor wrote a nice book called Uplift with oodles of advice from BC survivors on every relevant topic we face. Women sent her their tips and she put it all together in this book. If you have a kindle you can try a sample. I still have several weeks to go but I am feeling like I want to taste all my favorite foods, take walks on the beach, clean my house, try to get sleep (which is hard) and spend quality time with my family. Gosh that list makes me tired. Have a peaceful weekend and know we are rooting for all of you starting this coming week. If you have prayer requests send them my way. We love to pray.",

I think if I am going back and forth and want to put sticky notes in and find stuff fast I might stick with a regular book which you can pass on to another sister in the future. After onc meeting I think you have about 3 weeks before chemo can start, In my case I had to have a pre-port appt then have the port put in another day and also arrange for an heart test because the Herceptin can cause heart issues (Oh joy!). I also had something I really wanted to attend in Sept so they arranged the date knowing that I would be feeling better by the time the event came around. So there could be different factors. I was told it is better to wait a week after the port is put in because the area is tender.",

They in turn can write you notes of encouragement. You can make it as private as you want. You can check me out at www.caringbridge.org/visit/sharonevans. You will have to register an e-mail and password for security to see my site. If you don't want to do that you can just visit caringbridge.org to see if it is right for you. Someone also told me the American Cancer Society in some areas has connections to people who will clean your house, help with transportation, one on one mentoring with a cancer survivor etc. while you are going through treatment. Contact your local American Cancer Society to see what resources they have available. They also have a free workshop called Looking Good..it gives all kinds of beauty tips and free goodie bag for participants. Thanks for listening.",
