I was refused for both trials as I was ineligible so my onc has started me on Afinitor/Avastin. It is dreadful. i am diabetic and it has thrown my blood sugars way out. I have mouth sores, headaches, insomnia, worsening neuropathy in my feet, bloody noses, sinus infection. He started me on 10mg, lkoss of appetite as everything tastes disgusting. I am going to see him this week to get it reduced to 7.5 mg or 5 mg. My worst nightmare.  Only thing I have left to try is Tamoxifen before I start chemo. Wish we could get fulvestrant and ibrance here in Australia.",

He is treating it as matter of urgency and looks like I will be having Radio soon and changing my AI. He is also trying to get me into the Ibrance trial here in Australia. Only small downside if I get in is travel to the trial hospital once a month he says which is a 4 hour round trip but I hope I make it in.",
