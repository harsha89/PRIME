So please hang on to that thought for a little bit of reassurance during this trying time.  And keep communicting with us if that is what helps.  Thinking of you!",

I doubted myself right up to the moment the techs left the room to start the radiation.  It was an extremely difficult decision, because there is no right answer.  Some areas are very grey and it is up to each individual as to what sits best with them. I hated that there was not a formula to tell me what to do.  Half the studies supported my decision and half the studies suggested radiation probably was not necessary.  Everyone left the final decision up to me.  My DH leaned towards no radiation, but knew better than to influence my decision as I am so self-reliant.  I have to live with my decisions, so have to decide what is best for me.  I asked the advise of women on these boards also and although I would never leave my decision up to anyone, hearing others' thoughts and feelings really helped.  It is a struggle that will only end once you have decided and in my situation, once I could no longer change my mind :) I have no advice, just thought it may help if I shared my experience.  Good luck with your decision.        ",

So far, so good.  Only a bit tanned.  I had to have a mx due to having small breasts and a large area of DCIS.  That should have done it for me but then had a small area of positive margin even following the mx.  BS thought I would still be fine and RO stated that radiation would reduce my chance of a recurrence, but introduce SE of radiation.  Chance of recurrence was still quite low, but not nearly as low as it would have been with negative margins.  I was so stuck for so long. Also, having rads now meant that I would not be a candidate should a recurrence happen.  In the end, I decided to do all I could at the outset to rid myself of this disease.  SE of radiation are rare and I am hoping that I will benefit much more from the rads rather than worry about the long-term SE's.  There was no right answer, but that also meant there was no wrong answer, just what I was most comfortable with.  So far, do not regret my decision at all.  Good luck with your decision and I so get how difficult this is.

I am not certain what you are dealing with, but I had extensive DCIS, which I believed to be a relatively good thing compared to some of my options. I had to have a mx of my left breast as I am very small breasted and a lumpectomy would have basically been the same thing. I was so relieved to find out that it was completely DCIS, no node involvement and then the cruncher. A positive posterior margin. My BS would not do further surgery as she stated that it was like going in blind. DCIS does not show up so there is no way of knowing where to take more tissue. She felt my risk was still small and did not recommend radiation. But my odds of a recurrence suddenly went from 1 or 2 % to 13%. I was not happy. So I met with a radiologist and we reviewed studies that are now showing benefits of radiation following a mx. Reduces rate of recurrence to 7.5% (basically by 50%), but adds the risks of radiation. I was so torn by this decision, but opted for the radiation. I have never regretted my decision. I have nothing to add regarding the effects on reconstruction as I did not go that route. Sorry you have this added complication. As though there is not enough already to face and decide. Good luck with your decision.",

I had a mx for DCIS and there were both close margins and one focal point of positive margin. At first I thought that my BS would remove more tissue in the area of the positive margin. She stated that she could not as it would be going in blind as you cannot see DCIS and the positive margin was microscopic. The close margins were against the chest wall and therefore nothing further could be removed. I researched this topic so extensively that my RO stated that I had found more relevant studies than his research assistant did! Needless to state, the inconclusive nature of this predicament drove me crazy. My BS did not feel that radiation was warranted, but the studies were inconclusive. The RO agreed that there was no absolute here and it was more about my personality type and ability to tolerate risk factors that mattered more. First of all, most of the recent studies conclude that any margin, no matter how small, is now considered to be clear. So I am discussing an actual positive margin. Radiation would reduce recurrence rates by 50% but produce new risk factors. I opted for radiation as I wanted to do everything I could do upfront. I do not accept risk well. Others can and do opt out of radiation, knowing it will then be there in their arsenal of tools should the cancer return. I agonized over this decision, but the good news is that I have never second guessed my decision. I went with my gut despite my DH supporting the BS. It is a very grey area and therefore a very personal decision. Unfortunately, a second opinion, although warranted, may not produce the desired reassurance. All the best.",

But reviewing the women's experiences above flies in the face of that theory! I had daily xrays also and often was repositioned before receiving radiation. I was also tattooed. I expressed concern also and was advised that daily xrays do not even register against rads. Realizing how strong our rads are scared me then more than ever! But given my rads were to my left side and how often I was repositioned made me thankful for this level of precision now offered to radiation patients. Imagine several zaps hitting the heart or lung instead. That is what they are avoiding and although we all want to avoid more radiation, permanent lung or heart damage may be the result. Now, almost three years later, I seldom think about radiation and have no apparent SE yet. Good luck everyone.",

IMRT has had some recent concerns, so please check into that before choosing.  To make things even more difficult, it does depend also on the RO, protocol in your treatment centre, the equipment, your specific cancer, etc. etc. Like inks stated, getting a second opinion is also very helpful.  Find out what your chances of a recurrence are with and without radiation.  Then compare that to the risk of SE.  If you are a number gal like I was, that really helped.  Your RO should be able to assist you.  So if your reduction in recurrence is 7% (that was mine) and the chances of SE (long-term) were 3% (made that one up), then you have a 4% gain by perhaps doing radiation.  But your personal health issues, etc. would have to also be considered.  The risk reduction by doing tamoxifan for me was 3% only and I agreed with my RO not to bother given the SE's and risks of the drug may outweigh that low percentage.  Nothing is definite though, but this rationale really helped me.  Hope I have not overwhelmed you.  I can dig up some of the research for you if that would help.  ((hugs))    ",

Now I have lost a total of 35 lbs and have gotten this old body into great shape, feeling better than I have in 14 years (since turning 40 and gradually putting on the lbs.).  I was a pretty serious wine drinker, enjoying a glass or two every evening as I cooked up a delicious dinner (cooking is my hobby).  Cutting the wine down has probably been the most difficult change for me.  The studies are not conclusive and although it does appear that alcohol may contribute to breast cancer, it is also apparent that alcohol in moderation does contribute to better cardiovascular health.  All women who have undergone radiation or chemo, have an increased chance of heart problems and wine could help to prevent that.  I do not want to take the time to summarize all the pros and cons here, just want to point out that we all interpret studies and facts in a fashion that will support what we want.  I wanted to find anything that stated that I could have a glass of wine and not feel so guilty that it ruined the entire experience.  Having a glass of wine is no different than having a piece of cheese cake for a treat.  Stopping at 4oz is like eating 1/4 of the piece of cake! So why is wine so often judged so harshly.  Keeping those extra lbs around your waist line or not exercising daily probably is more harmful.  Do we judge those so harshly that just do not make it to the gym? Let's support each other in all the difficult choices we are now forced to make.  I am trying so hard to enjoy my wine like the last time in Italy and all my other travels where food and wine were a huge contributor to my quality of life.  I want some of that back.  Is that so wrong?   ",

The good news is that  one week to the day post rads, it suddenly and dramatically improved.  The pain ceased, as did the chills and the skin started to dry up and heal.  I am now shedding like a snake.  So hang in there for another day or two and hopefully the same relief will come to you.  I hate to whine, but I was miserable for about 6 days.  Good luck getting through the last of this.  Relief is close at hand!   ",

Actually, it is only the radiated area that needs to stay out of the sun.  But just having gone through radiation burn, I will never suffer from another sunburn if I can help it :) I read a recent study about skin creams and radiation and skin breakdown and just like the thread \"A radiation onc checks in\" or something like that, nothing is really going to prevent skin breakdown, however, the calendula cream is stated as the best for soothing skin conditions that result.  Women have also stated repeatedly that pure Aloe Vera is also very good.  Sometimes you can buy a large leaf in an Asian market and use the real deal.  That is what I did. Just like everyone reacts differently to chemo or any other treatment, everyone is different with radiation also.  I have learnt from this experience that science is far from an exact science, but so far, it is as good as it gets.  And that really goes for everything in life as the more knowledge we gain, things change and differ.  That applies to what we all do as well, from everything like parenting, purchasing cars or our work and careers.  When I think back to the days that we used to keep adoptions a secret even from the adoptee, I cringe.  But it was the best practice at the time. But not buying into the best practice at the time has its consequences too that are also unproven.  That is why I truly believe that deciding to have radiation was the hardest decision of my life.  But no regrets here.   ",

In the meantime, try to do anything but google and guess at what your final dx may be.  My BS left following my surgery before even speaking with us, so that left me without any info.  Knowing more pre-surgery is not much help as that info can change and often does in the final pathology report.  So try to keep yourself busy and as distracted as possible.  I won't even try to tell you not to worry :)",
