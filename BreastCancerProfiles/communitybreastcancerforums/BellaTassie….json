I do understand that this will also starve the cancer of sugar, so I have several incentives to stick to this diet I did multiple days a few times, which I found was fine. I lost about 5 kg, which was great! But then I had to start on prednisolone for an autoimmune disease triggered by herceptin and Perjeta, and it needed to be taken with food so I started to fast from about 7pm till about 11 am or later, depending on my activity level. (I always eat protein soon after moderate to heavy exercise.) I'm almost off prednisolone now and finally starting to lose weight again :). Once I'm off it completely in June I will do multiple day fasts again. I hadn't thought to do it with HP infusions, I thought it was only good with chemo. But after reading that article I will make sure to time it with infusions also. So do you start the day before or how do you time it?",

I keep hoping there is a trial involving low carb that I could join. My gym classes recommenced today, I haven't done anything since mid December. I caught a cold, which is rare for me, and it took a fortnight before I felt better 🤧. Today I did Polarity, which is like aerobics, very high energy. I stood out a few reps here and there but sweat so much, it's summer and the aircon just doesn't cut it. Then I did Stretch and Tone, which I enjoyed. My weight is abominable, my fat gut gets in the way all the time, I'm carrying an extra 20 kg. I'm not motivated to fast and lose weight again just yet but I'm hoping the return to regular gym classes will change that soon. Keep moving and keep posting 😊.",

Like others on this thread, I was encouraged to increase my exercise by her sharing her knowledge of the benefits for us stage 4s. I bought a Fitbit to join the group and have deliberately increased my steps, if nothing else, as a consequence, and I will be forever grateful to her for this. I have nothing but admiration for her dedication to research and fearlessness in undertaking her own complementary treatment, whether it be diet/fasting, exercising during infusions, hot yoga, treatment in a Japan!!!, oxygen therapy etc. Wow, what a woman! Truly inspirational. Thanks Z. This last week I did 2 cycle classes, 1 Pump, 1 Pilates and 2 Tai Chi, less than usual. But I\u2019ve started pelvic floor Pilates in a small group class with a physiotherapist, and have been very surprised at how much improvement I\u2019ve made in my pelvic floor strength in just 3 weeks of kegals several times a day. It won\u2019t improve my posterior wall prolapse, which I was horrified to learn I had, but it should help my symptoms (along with other interventions). When I next see my Onc I\u2019m going to ask for vaginal oestrogen to help prevent my prolapse worsening. It\u2019s a quality of life issue for me. Keep moving folks. And happy International Womens Day",

I have a seroma which requires periodic aspiration and am still sore at lymph node site so am still wearing a surgical bra. I have a small/moderate size concave area above the incision where the surgeon deliberately took extra fat from under the skin as the tumour was close to the skin and I have inflammatory breast cancer, which involves the lymph vessels of the skin. The surgeon left the infra-mammary fold so I could pursue reconstruction 12 months after radiotherapy treatment. I was quite shocked that I wasn't flat when she removed the pressure dressing as she had told me she could not leave ANY skin due to having inflammatory breast cancer. I was very upset with the sight of the unexpected dog ear, concave area and infra-mammary fold! However I now realise the benefit of the latter is that it helps to anchor the bra. I'm not sure if this will continue after the seroma resolves because it really is quite swollen the entire length of the scar, so when it is deflated and soft permanently I doubt it will do this as well? I was desperate to find a high necked camisole to cover both the concave area and the scar/foob for when I bent forward, as I have just returned to the gym and will be leaning right down quite regularly. Anyway I was thrilled to find a beautiful stretchy lace bralette at Target for AU$15 - I am in Australia so unsure if this helps you US and Canadian girls much? The added benefit of it is that the whole thing is quite firm so it is added security for holding the foob in place! And I read on these boards of a cheap swimming foob which I've used pinned to my normal bathers, but with a rash vest over the top. It is the scrunchie that you use to wash with. So for my aqua class I've been pinning the scrunchie top and bottom onto cup of bathers, putting bralette over for added hold, then covering with a rash vest. It's worked really well. I like to sunbathe (naughty I know!) so I will probably buy proper mastectomy bathers and a swimmin prosthesis at some stage, but this is fine for aqua class right now. ",

I expected the flashes to ease, but they haven\u2019t. I started femara today. She gave me a script for I box of temaz and said I just needed to get back into a good sleep pattern and I\u2019d be right - I could have them 2-3 consecutive nights a week. Well on the nights I\u2019ve had them I\u2019m still waking almost as frequently with hot flashes, but I must say I go back to sleep almost immediately and although I NEVER feel refreshed in the morning, I actually feel calm, which is good. The nights I don\u2019t take them r still hopeless. Im dreading the end of the box because she has no intention of another script. I\u2019m jealous of the people who sleep Orr prescribed ongoing sedation. I\u2019ve tried going to bed earlier but it just makes the night longer and is unbearable!",

But some mornings 4am is still it, I just watch my iPad until a decent hour to arise. I\u2019m not a coffee drinker so I drink a LOT of tea before midday trying to become more alert, but alas it doesn\u2019t work. I switch to herbal tea after midday, but this doesn\u2019t help sleep either! I\u2019d love to have a sharp brain again ...",

Perhaps I\u2019ll try that, but I know it will make weight loss that much harder. I guess I have to weigh up what is worse. I might wait a few months to see what side effects I get from femara before deciding. What dose r u on?",
