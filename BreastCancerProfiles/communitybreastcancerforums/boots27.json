The radiologist also recommended a 6 month follow up, but since I was sooooo anxious and couldn't sleep or eat for 2 days afterwards, I called the radiologist again, and pushed for a sooner followup. She gave me the option of doing a stereotactic needle core biopsy a week after, and I'm glad I did. They found atypical cells with that biopsy, and I was referred to a breast surgeon in which they performed a surgical excision of that area one month after my mammogram to make sure there were no cancer cells lurking around. Thank God, it was ok, but now I need an MRI to follow up nothing else is going on with the other side. It doesn't hurt to keep pushing for the \"peace of mind\" you're looking for and need. I couldn't wait another 6 months to find out. It was driving me crazy. My best to you!",

My life has not been the same since May. I tend to freak out anyway about little things...well, this was not little. Haven't been able to sleep through the night since. The surgical excision just takes more tissue around the biopsy site as they want to make sure there is nothing lurking around. The surgery itself was about an hour long, recovery time about another hour or two. A few days recovery period...no lifting, no driving, etc for about a week. As for the pain--not too painful, some \"shooting pains\" every now and then, but nothing that was unbearable. Just Tylenol worked well. Waiting for the results was awful...Prayers help so much, especially when I can't function with everyday stuff. Having family around made me feel like I wasn't so alone. You're not alone. We all know the fear. You will be ok, because whatever this is, it will be taken care of. Mine was still atypical cells after the surgical excision. They recommend an MRI to have peace of mind. I wish you the best. It's good your family will be around.",

May 21--diagnostic mammo with 3D tomosynthesis--found new calcifications on my left breast, off to ultrasound right after. The radiologist gives you the results right then and there. You won't leave that place without knowing. After one week, stereotactic needle core biopsy--waited one day for the results which revealed \"atypical cells\"...not definitive, so I was referred to a breast surgeon, and now will be having a surgical excision on Thursday. I am beyond scared. I cry and cry too. It helps me to cry and release, but I rely on prayers to get me through. I talk a lot to friends who have gone through this scare as well, and now are past it--whether it be with surgery, radiation, etc...They seem to be doing ok now...still closely monitored but they got through it. I am like you. I just pray that I'm just as lucky as they are. You are doing your very best. I am doing my very best. We are not waiting around to take care of it. But, I get it. I get the fear. Unable to work because I can't seem to go on. My young daughter is all I think about. I wake up in a state of panic, like I can't breathe. Sound familiar? I am terrified of the results, but I know that this waiting game is probably worse. Let me know how I can help.",

Stereotactic needle core biopsy on June 4 which revealed \"atypical cells\"--not definitive. Referred to a breast surgeon, and am now scheduled for a \"surgical excision\" this Thursday, June 25th. Freaking out every single day since May 21, unable to sleep without taking a sleeping pill, worried and crying a lot. I feel like I'm losing my mind with the waiting for the surgery, but terrified of the results, but at the same time, want it all done and can't wait to go on...but go on to what? The options give me so much fear. And yes, the surgery is to make sure there is no other cancer hanging around this atypical area. Good luck, and hope this helps you a little.",
