As a daughter that  her mom is suffering breast cancer stage IV can tell you.  I have never seen my mom as a burden.   Yes, it get hard sometime but, people get sick.    The only advice I can give you is  read the bible and go to church.. Seek the Lord.   I will pray for you and your lovely family Mayra",
