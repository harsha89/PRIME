That is part of soooo many decisions, we make the best ones we can with what are doctors and are heart tells us.   They set my next surgery for December 27th, I'm scared but glad we have a date now.  I hope everything goes well with you.  Do you know when you will be having your surgery?",

Sometimes I just want him to listen any pointers on how to make that happen please let me know.  Hope all goes well and each of us have to make decisions we feel comfortable with what one women does can be totally different.  If you have the right doctors they treat you like a individual. ",

My reconstuction doctor said he would like them to wait two more weeks chemo doctor wants to start next week.  Chemo doctor talks like he thinks I'm putting it off I was diagnosed in September but started with lumpectomy then another surgery to go back in for good margins.  Then that didnt work I had a mastectomy.  It has been long road but you all know that. I had a minor surgery yesterday to stitch up a open spot clean it out and put a drain back in.  I think the drain was taken out to early but things happen.  Anyone eles have this happen.  Sorry I'm all over the place just wanted peoples opinion.",
