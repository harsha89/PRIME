My Taxol didn't really give us the response we were hoping for and stopped after 7 sessions. I'm onto the CAF/FAC treatments now. This was my first one this Friday and I'm doing okay so far. Just nervous that we're going to \"run out \" of chemos. I know that's probably a pretty premature worry but one in my mind none the less. My anxiety was a bit more high at the last meeting with my onc. I liked going weekly for treatment... I felt like I was at least 'doing something' (even though we weren't..). I'm so paranoid as to what the off weeks will be like since I won't see anyone for 3 weeks (and going ever week made my time FLY by!). Ah well, I hope to get to know you girls as the time goes on :)",
