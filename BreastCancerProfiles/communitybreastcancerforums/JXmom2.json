IF it is cancer instead of getting the lump taken it and more tests will they let me just do a double mastectomy because of my family history I would want it.. And that would skip another scar/surgery right? Last what's your opinion based on these findings. I hate dr code id rather they say oh it's ...__% that is malagnent. Info Im 27 Have a big lump, my dr said prolly a cyst but got an ultra sound. The tech did her thing said hold on came back with a dr who asked a bunch of questions then said I need a biopsy. My Drs office called the next day said they can't get me seen my by the surgical dr my dr wanted but being a timely matter he okayed for radiologist at the breast center to do it. I asked them to read the report they had from ultra sound üëáüèº It's a birade 4C.

Just nice to talk since I can't keep busy enought to get it off my mind/ the same breast is having pain now. A spot the side of lump/ been using an ice pack. Ready for biopsy. Just looking for story's like yours ladys with bi rad 4 of some sort. Il ofcourse post my results good/or bad to give people an idea of what their results might be!  I don't have the best breast anyway (Tublar) so to try the lump/radiation over recontruction really wouldn't be a big let down I feel like either way it's scars and treatment. I had a genetic thing that caused my liver to get cirrohis so having a transplant at 13 I'm really ready with the anything is possible ...kinda thought. It's this part the waiting and different tests that's hard",
