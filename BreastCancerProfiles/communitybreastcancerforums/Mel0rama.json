      "Content": "Mar 30, 2015 06:29AM - edited Mar 30, 2015 06:31AM by Mel0rama I just found this group. I really wish I had done so much earlier...I pretty much went through this journey cold and on my own. That's not because I didn't know there were resources and people out there to help, I think I was in such denial and I crawled into my own little shell. Is it weird that I'm now finally coming out of it? I count myself very lucky, my story was a good one. The only real issues I'm having now is a wonky TE (you can find my post on that) and basically waiting on my exchange surgery to see what happens with the newly approved larger silicone implants. It's just a waiting game at this point. I will say on the side where they took the lymph nodes, I'm having a really hard time with arm pain around my elbow and forearm. Normal? I religiously did the stretches and exercises. I have tried getting back into the gym to my previous weightlifting routine, but it just is not happening. I will say I'm excited, just bought a bike last week, and I'm slowly training to do a large breast cancer benefit ride in September. Nice to \"meet\" fellow December surgery gals. Even if it's WAY after Decenber 2014. :-)",

Also, the AlloDerm obviously come apart all around the right breast and partially on the side on the left. So he will repair that as well. The best part? I will have drains again. I am SO excited. (Yes. That was sarcasm.)",
