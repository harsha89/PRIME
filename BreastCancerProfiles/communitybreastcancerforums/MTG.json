I'd rather not have to wear tegaderms throughout rads. Does anyone have any suggestion re: what to use. I'm even fine with ink that will last for months and months if it wont smear or disappear for the next few weeks. Help !

However, since I dont go to synagogue every week, I dont feel comfortable calling my concern religious. Another issue is that I have crazy skin that reacts badly to just about anything.

As for the pemanent tattoos, even though tiny, they're not really an option either for reasons beyond mere vanity, although vanity is certainly one (albeit somewhat frivolous) factor. Bluedasher - I also had a bit of a reaction to the Tegaderm, although no where near as severe as yours - just some redness and itching the first couple of days after the patches went on and lots of redness when they changed them today before the first rads. I did some research and discovered a similar but hypoallergenic transparant dressing called Bioclusive by Johnson & Johnson. Bought some today on my way home from a local medical supply store. Will let you know is it's better than the Tegaderm (although not in a rush to pull those sucked off anytime soon.) The quest for a permanent ink continues !",

But since the techs do the marking, and they most likely already think I'm on the pushy/offbeat side, I'm hesitant to suggest the henna. I've already suggested surgical pens and they dont even want to try them (apparently the ink rubs off with alcohol but my position is that that's irrelevant since I'm not using any alcohol on the area .) One of these days, I might just draw a star or smilely on my breast as a test, so that the techs and I can see if it lasts. j414 - clearly, you're prescient. Yesterday, right before rads, they cut down the tegaforms to a much, much smaller size so that the covered and thus irritated area would be smaller and today they told me that they think they'll remove theTegaderm/ tape on Mondays, simply remark me each day and then retape me on Fridays. All -  Had my first Rads Crazy moments in the middle of the night last night. The radiation techs and doctors told me to be sure to preserve the ink dots and the tegaderms; the nurse told me to moisturize 3 times a day and gave me Aquaphor. Last night I applied the Aquaphor including over the Tegaderm just beneath my breast and...the entire g-d thing started slipping off...and the ink was somehow attached to the Tegaderm. So everything is slipping and I'm going nuts. Applying tape, applying bandaids, trying to hold it in place, researching (which I'm apt to do, esp under pressure). Turns out Aquaphor is an adhesive remover. Aargh !!! Emailed my doctor at about midnight feeling compelled to share that bit of info. (Picture a topless, greast up lady sitting at desk madly typing) Woke up in the middle of the night with the darn tegaderm closer to my navel than my breast and emailed my poor doctor again at 3:30am. I'm sure they're convinced I'm nuts. And maybe I am. Well, it's the weekend I hope all of you who've been at this for a bit, enjoy the break and get some much deserved down time. I'm going to scout out padded rooms just in case.",

If I may offer a bit of advice: stop using the wash cloth and dont let the shower water hit your chest directly. Both are much too abrasive right now, Instead, shield your front from the direct water, just massage a gentle soap (I use Cetaphil gentle which doesn't even need to be washed off)  and then either splash water over it or squeeze the washcloth so it run over it. Personally, even though I dont like them, I've switched to baths (warm not hot) and just dunk. For the stinging/pain, try a Vinegar soak (1 part Apple Cider Vinegar to 9 parts cold water) mixed in a dish and then dunk a washcloth, wring it out and lay it gently over the breast/ chest and underarm - I've found that Vinegar gets rid of itching, stinging and even relieves the tightness at the incision sites. But, for you, be careful to avoid any open wounds/ raw skin since it will sting ! Also, try putting a thick layer of Aquaphor on the nipple to remoisturize it and help with the burning/pain.  Hope this helps!",

Two ideas - First -wash off the lotion you're using and see if the itching subsides after a couple of hours. I developped a reaction to Aquaphor even though I had used it since the very begining.  I also found that I had a reaction to any cortizone cream or gel. In fact, as time goes on, I find that less is more in avoiding itching. Second, with the Apple Cider Vinegar - you may want to try mixing it with refrigerated water which helps the soothing, putting the wash cloth on your chest,  laying you handhand lightly over it.to help it soak in and leaving it there for a while. As the washcloth gets warm, wring it out and dip it back into the ACV water solution. As my rads have progessed, I soak for longer periods and more frequently. Your should actually feel the itching subside while you've got the washcloth on. That's how I can tell it's working. .Crummy tummys and general ickiness are unfortunately also SE for many. I have started taking naps which make me good to go for round 2 for the day but I also find that a brinsk walk gives me more energy than anything else. Congratulations on having only 6 more to go. I've got 3 regualrs and 5 boosts left so I more than you and will be thinking of you as I count down",

And yes, radiation is, for most, relatively easy and goes surprisingly quickly once the first 10 days are behind you. My bits of advice - moisturize liberally (but if you get itchy bumps, easy off it to make certain your skin isn't reacting to the moisturizers);  go topless when possbile, the air an absence of rubbing against clothing help; dont let shower water hit your breast directly; and pre-shop/ buy yourself gifts for  days when you're down.

And at the end of my final boost - and they do this for everyone - all the techs came in clapping, they gave me a \"diploma and had me stomp my body cast (kindof like the breaking of a glass in a jewish wedding ceremony). Definitely more fun than you're supposed to have during radiation !",

Try talking to the techs, explain your nausea and then \"helpfully\" suggest that since the women is in a wheel chair and needs assistance perhaps it would be best all around if they had the extra room that changing in an examination room could afford them . The changing room would remain smokefree for all patients and the couple wouldn't have to cram into a small space. It might work ! blondie45  - I think the \"extra\" burning stinks (as if radiation isn't enough) and, while I agree with vtmom that positive thinking helps, I really can't blame you for hating the process. However, perhaps you should ask for an explanation as to WHY they want you to burn.; maybe there's something about the location of your cancer or some other logical reason that makes it important. For me, if I could hold onto a truly valid explanation as to why I'm in pain, then it might make it a bit more bearable. And please keep in mind that once radiation is over, things start getting better rapidly, unlike taxol which lingers in your system for a good while. I'm just 2 days out of it and my breast and chest already look and feel far better than last week. vtmom - Good for you and your positive attitude. I admit, I didn't know one could be both a workaholic and a treehugger !",

Tracyanne andKime - sorry to hear about your rashes. Tracyanne - I'm also on Tamoxifen and have researched the hell out of it (there's a Tamoxifen thread if you're interested - Bottle O Tamoxifen); although there aren't supposed to be skin reactions, I've read thru the whole thread and occassionally women do have rashes as a reaction to T(although yours is more major than any I've seen there). If your med onc okays it, one easy way to check it is to go off T for a week or two and see if the rash clears up. If it does, you know. It may be the fillers used by your particular manufacturer - for example some used dried milk as a filler so those with milk alleries may react. There may be some long time uers on the Tamoxifen thread that can help you more.

(The only caveat is if you're still too sore to comfortably lift your arm over your head while lying down; then it can be a bit awkward.) After it's over - and it will be over in a flash - you'll be wondering \"Is this all there is to it?\" Absolutely no pain whatsoever during the radiation treatment, just hold still for a bit while the machine buzzes. Ok, with that said, here are my recommendations: FREQUENCY - 3 times a day seems to be the average. Many of us apply our lotions more frequently so that everything stays pretty well moisturized. WHEN - 1) Most do apply it just after rads but as dsgirl pointed out, it will make your top sticky so wear a washable tee between you and your blouse or sweater or under a blazer, 2) then apply it again before bed, 3) the third time depends on when you have your rads, if it's not till late afternoon, apply it first thing in the Am. Basically you're just spacing things out. NOTE - Again as dsgirl pointed out, DO NOT APPLY IT 3 or EVEN 4 HOURS BEFORE TREATMENT. The exact timing varies from place to place; for me it is 4 hours. Ask your techs. And no worries if you miss applying it before tomorrow's treatment, not a big deal. WHERE - Again ask your techs to ID the specific area being radiated, it varies somewhat from person to person. The affected area is actually bigger than you would think. Generally, the area that should be moisturized is: (a) to the center of your chest (the tattoo there is the outer perimeter); (b) to just below your collar bone; (c) slightly under your breast and (d) your underarm, down your side and sometimes a bit of your back. Pay special attention to your underarm and beneath the breast since these seem to be problem areas. Also, ask your techs about using moisturizers in addition to aloe- which is great but somewhat drying.  We're all here to ask and answer questions. Feel free to post or IM, as you prefer.",

I was shocked at how long it took. I'd gently wash, then rinse but the residue was still there so I kept repeating the cycle. Then I patted myself dry and took a nap without any top on. A few hours later the bumps were almost gone as was the itching. From that point forward, I'd apply a light layer of a light moisturizer (I esp. liked XClair at this stage) only twice a day. After that, when I would occassionally feel my skin reacting by getting itchy bumps, I'd go to the sink as soon as I felt it, washed off the lotion and let my breast have a good long break.

Although it sounds odd and old fashioned, apparenty the Apple Cider Vinegar prevents the radiation from staying in the skin which, for me at least, is unintentional/collateral damage.

I first tried it with gauze soaked in the ACV which was fine, but I wanted to type, so I put on some a white cotton glove (the kind you sleep in with moisturizer) and soaked it with the ACV. It took about an hour for the burning to go away. I took a nap and when I woke up not only had the pain dissapeared but there is nary a red spot on my hand! PS. That tea I was making was for a cold, so while I had the ACV out, I poured some into my water bottle & drank that, and have been sipping it all night.

And I'm betting that you'll have 5 boosts which seems to be the norm. Now, lets look at the numbers: if you've done 9/30 (not counting the boosts), then as of tomorrow, you'll be 1/3 done; as of next Friday, you'll be half way thru regular rads. Now, dont those numbers sound LOTS better ? I made those same calculations for myself and, to make things even better, I pre-bought little presents for myself for either significant milestones or for days when I was down and needed a pick me up - a pair of earrings, a muffler, sneakers I wanted...It's fun opening presents !!!

While we're all going thru rads, your huge commute increases the stress exponentially. I'm so glad you've decided to allow your husband to do the driving. I think that we spend so much time being strong during BC and trying to prove that we're just as independent as always that sometimes we're reluctant to accept help to simply lighten our load. Please keep in mind that our loved ones WANT to help. It makes them feel as if they're contributing, involved and showing how much they care. Even my 83 year old mother has gotten into the act  - cooking and sending me food care packages. Sometimes it's wonderful things like cold poached salmon (Gotta love Mom's cooking); sometimes it's odd things like a bag of whole raw cranberries (She read about antioxidants.) But, always, I know she's showing she loves me and cares and is doing something to help me go thru this. Let your husband do the same and enjoy the ride. All - Tomorrow is my last of 33 radiation treaments After 4 days of various muffins, cookies, bagels and pastries, my final fattening thank you gift to my rads team is this:  A little gross but hopefully we'll all laugh our butts off.
