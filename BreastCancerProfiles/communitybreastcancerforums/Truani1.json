This week was supposed to be my last week of RT. Monday morning as I was getting ready to go to therapy, I suffered severe chest pain, nausea with acute dry heaves, and diaphoresis. I have never had a cardiac event before, but I was certain it was a heart attack. By the time paramedics arrived the pain was radiating to my neck, shoulders, and down both arms. Repeated blood draws showed rising troponin levels. My EKG was abnormal. I ended up in the vascular ICU, receiving a nitro drip, blood thinners, etc. Multiple echo cardiograms showed no serious fluid around my heart. Multiple chest CTs with contrast and a head CT showed no signs of damage. I had a heart catheterization as well. I saw the video of it and my heart was beating strongly, with no blockages, tears, or leaks. I was released after about 30 hours and told to follow up with my PCP, and my oncologist. Which I am trying to do right now. Whiile waiting to hear back from them, I did some research. It seems that there is serious risk of damage to the heart with Radiation Therapy. Especially if you have other health issues like high cholesterol, diabetes, etc. A greater risk than I was lead to believe. In fact, here was more talk about possible \"minor\" damage to my lungs. I don't recall my oncologist mentioning the possibility of heart damage. Obviously, the chance for damage is increasedif the target area is the left breast. And the damage may not show up for years. I wish I had been more knowledgeable in the beginning. I don't think that I would have gone with the radiation had I known the risk to my heart. Now, in addition to monitoring myself for signs of returning breast cancer, I will be watching for cardiac issues too.",

It is only on the left side, where I received radiation. Others claim not to smell it, but like everyone else, I have a hard time believing it. I am supposed to get one more week of radiation, but as I suffered a cardiac incident that was apparently related to radiation therapy, I have decided not to continue the therapy and take my chances. I believe the odor is from the dying tissue from the radiation moving through the lymphatic system, as the odor didn't arise until weeks into my treatment, and the cancerous tissue had already been removed, along with the sentinel node. I also believe the sentinel node excision plays a part in how fast and how efficiently the lymphatic system can rid your body of the dead cells, and it's removal likely slows the process. Anyone receiving radiation therapy knows how damaged and sensitive the skin in that area is, so I am not putting anything on it as of now. No deodorant, corn starch, apple cider vinegar, etc. It's frustrating because within minutes of showering the smell is there. But I intend to drink plenty of water, especially with lemon or lime in it, and check with a medical professional about exercises I can do that will help the lymphatic system function as well as possible. Hang in there folks. All in all, an odor is a small price to pay to be free of cancer. And I strongly believe it can be controlled with proper exercise and good hydration, or at least I hope so. I would caution anyone newly diagnosed with breast cancer to educate themselves before they agree to radiation therapy. Had I realized the possible dangers and side effects, I would have opted not to have it. My cancer was extremely small, and fully excised. It was also the most common and least aggressive breast cancer.So my chances of recovery were good without radiation.",
