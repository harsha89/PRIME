During the week of April 10, 2011, I was in my last week of radiation (boost treatments) when the breast started to leak a fluid, became hardened and very painful. After examinations by all 3 of my physicians (oncology radiologist, surgeon and oncologist) it was determined to be enflamed breast / cellulitis. I was on 2 Rx's of Keflex antibiotic to help with the mild fever, inflamation due to the cellulitis. It's now been almost 8 weeks since the end of my radiation, and the breast seems to be healing from everything it's been through. Not that it's 100% or ever will be, but it's taken several weeks to make some good healing progress. JanetBergeron",
