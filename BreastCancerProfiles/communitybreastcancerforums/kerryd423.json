I am now 4 weeks PFC and beginning to have some sparse downy sprouts- more each day. Looking forward to some full coverage. You look great! My eyebrows and lashes fell out last week, but already coming back so full and soft. I feel all new!",

I wanted to comment to Littleblue regarding the Hydrogel... worked wonders for me. I've been fortunate and my skin has held it together. But last week I started to blister and used the hydrogel dressings and the area acutally healed through that last week of whole breast radiation. It looks great today- pink in some areas but all intact skin.Â I also used Calendula three times a day and Jeans Cream at night faithfully through treatment. Wish everyone well and speedy healing...gentle hugs...",

My tumor was not seen on mammogram in January, but palpated in February. Needle biopsy showed I was triple positive, the tumor measured 1.1 cm. My surgeon gave me the option of a lumpectomy vs. mastectomy, while gently steering me towards a lumpectomy as she felt confident she could get clean margins. She provided reassurance that we could always do a mastectomy \"down the road\" if she didn't get clean margins, or if I was too anxious about recurrence. The thinking of my team is that a lumpectomy with clean margins followed by treatment is just as effective as a mastectomy. It was a difficult decision (I hate that there are so many decisions for us to make on this road). Ultimately I chose the lumpectomy, and clean margins were achieved. In making the decision, it was important to me to know that a lumpectomy would be scheduled sooner and also allow me to start treatment with chemo sooner. I also knew I had the option of a mastectomy, but didn't have to commit to it immediately, but that she left that door open to me as a future option. My lumpectomy was 4 weeks ago. Everything went very well, I took 3 days off from work and was able to return. Pain was minimal, swelling and bruising is almost resolved now. I start chemo tomorrow. (Herceptin and Taxol). Lumpectomy vs. Mastectomy is a very difficult decision. I had my doubts even in the initial days following my surgery, but now feel confident that I made the right decision at this time. I have healed and am ready to move on. Chances are good that I will not need further surgery and it helps to keep my optimism up. My surgeon explained that, for some women, the anxiety of recurrence plays a strong role in choosing mastectomy. She also said that doing a mastectomy does not always relieve the anxiety and there are other ways to treat anxiety. That makes sense to me now. I don't feel as anxious about not doing the mastectomy. I wish you all the best with your surgery and treatment. Triple positive is an unusual place to be, I hope we can keep this thread going and share our experiences.",
