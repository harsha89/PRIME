I was in complete discomfort for 6+ months after bi-lateral mastectomy with reconstruction. I highly recommend medical cupping done by massage therapists. It helped me tremendously. The pain and tightness would be so tight it would nearly take my breathe away. There is another procedure along the lines of cupping but cannot remember the name for it.",
