I am having the last carbo/taxol today for clear cell ovarian cancer dx'd this spring after my last PET/CT in April. The carbo/taxol kicked butt on my ovarian cancer and my bone mets! This is what my oncs and I were hoping for. I will continue on Aromasin and Zometa for time being. My time on Aromasin may be limited because of bone thinning and osteopenia. I have my second stress fracture in my right foot, which is going to be hard to heal until I get the chemo out of my system and my blood counts back to normal. I will probably never be able to wear high heels again. I guess this is the slver lining for the ovarian cancer. NED and I found out I am not BRCA 1 or 2 so I do not worry quite so much for my kids and nieces and nephews. 3//2006 Rt: IDC, DCS & IDC, ER+PR+HER2- IIIB, Lt: IDC IIA ER+PR-HER2-; ACT, bilateral radiation, Tamoxifen and megace. 3/2010, bone mets skull, spine, ribs, pelvis, femurs, Aromasin and Zometa. 5/2012 clear cell ovarian cancer, carbo/taxol Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "GrandHillMom wrote: On May 21 I finally had robotic surgery to remove the large mass that my April 2 PET scan found on my left ovary.  The PET Scan and a subsequent ultrasound both indicated cancer.  My surgeon was therefore surprised when the intraoperative pathology report showed that the softball sized mass was benign.  She only removed the ovaries/tubes and part of the omentum (which is fat in the abdominal cavities) and left the nodes and did not do a hysterectomy.  The plan had been to take nodes and do a hysterectomy only if ovarian cancer and not from BC mets.  I went home the same day and told everyone it was benign.  Then, on Thursday I went for my scheduled post-op appointment.   The surgeon told me that the mass was in fact a rare form of ovarian cancer (like 2%) called \"clear cell\" which she found out does not show up on the intraoperative pathology, probably because it is clear!  She got the final path report stating it was clear cell ovarian cancer the following day, however, and never let me know for over two weeks that I had cancer and needed chemo!!  She said she wanted to tell me in person.  I can't believe she did not call me.  I do not understand why so many doctors will not give bad news in an effective way.  My BC onc has a bad habit of not giving all the info, which I have dealt with by getting all the reports from scans, etc. my self.  I guess I should have asked for my pathology report right away, but since I was told it was benign, I did not see the need.  Luckily, the cancer is at Stage 1a.  There is no cancer outside the ovary, which was removed intact, and no cancer in the other ovary or either tube.  Also, no BC mets in the ovaries.  My surgeon took my case to the tumor conference to discuss whether I should have additional surgery and they decided I did not need to to that but that I should have chemo, probably because it grew from undetectable to softball size in about six months between my PET scans.   It will be taxol and carboplatin, every 21 days for 6 treatments. I am starting June 19.   I had taxol six years ago (weekly for 12 weeks) after having dose dense A/C, both prior to a double mastectomy.   I will be losing all my hair, which is a bummer.  I looked into the cold cap, but it is a huge huge hassle and quite expensive.  You have to spend nine or ten hours having the cap changed every half hour, with the three or four hour chemo in the middle.  It basically freezes your scalp because it is 30 degrees below zero.  You rent the cap for $500 a month and my chemo will last 4 1/2 months.  I just think it sounds like a waste of money that could be used for better things.  I asked the chemo nurses if anyone used it and one replied \"only 'special' clientele\"--I think she meant high maintenance, which I am not.   I also will have genetic testing, although my surgeon/onc says that she hasn't heard of this type of clear cell ovarian cancer being related to BRCA 1 or 2.  In my immediate family (me, Mom and Dad) we have had two types of breast cancer, with mine metastatic, metastatic prostate cancer and now rare ovarian cancer.  It seems like there has to be some kind of genetic connection.  I have two brothers, two kids and four nieces/nephews that really need to know if there is.  Thanks for reading my lengthy post!  3//2006 Rt: IDC, DCS & IDC, ER+PR+HER2- IIIB, Lt: IDC IIA ER+PR-HER2-; ACT, bilateral radiation, Tamoxifen and megace. 3/2010, bone mets skull, spine, ribs, pelvis, femurs, Aromasin and Zometa. 5/2012 clear cell ovarian cancer, carbo/taxol Log in to post a reply",
