Did you feel any with taxol? I'm wondering With TAxol, is it usually flare involving pain, or just straight up raised TM's? I know the hormonals can cause pain in bone mets but is flare pain in liver from TAxolcommon?guess I'll just wait and see",

Can anyone who experienced tumour flare pain to their liver tell me how soon after chemo change did the pain occur and was there any indication of raised lft's or low white blood counts etc? Not ctc bloods, and how long did it last before it completely stopped Thank you Log in to post a reply",
