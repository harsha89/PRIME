Some surgeons have told me it's okay to do it as long as lymphedema not present at time ..others say it's fine unless patient has had radical mastectomy with all axillary nodes out. My take away avoid it unless emergency not worth the risk... now as a patient I hold firm to keeping away from right side... even when they say it's okay. I think the consensus is they don't know so rather be safe than sorry",

It's freaking scary and overwhelming to be diagnosed with cancer. I was diagnosed in July of this year. I am a registered nurse and am so uncomfortable being a patient, but I think of all the patient s I sat with as they were told their diagnosis and cried with them.it's okay and it's normal",

I am 32 I was diagnosed in July (right before my 32nd bday,20 weeks pregnant) with stage 2 triple negative breast cancer. I had a 2cm lump in breast and one positive node. I had a lumpectomy and node dissection first.and have started chemotherapy,3rounds AC so far.  Have they discussed genetic testing ? I found out I am brca 1 positive so I am having double mastectomy before radiation. It's all so much to process my advice is to reach out to friends and family for support..it's hard to accept help sometime s but let people help you ..makes carrying this load a little easier  Xoxo",
