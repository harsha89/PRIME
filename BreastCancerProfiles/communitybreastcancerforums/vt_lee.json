I got the \"cliff notes version\" of my biopsy results from the nurse yesterday - grade 3 mucinous/colloid invasive carcinoma. No other details yet - I meet with the surgeon on Monday when he returns from his conference.  I am relieved just to have an answer and I'm ready to start making a plan to fight this thing. Hope you are well - enjoy your weekend! ~Lee",

We will both nail this, just as Jocelyne and so many others have done before us!  I'm going to rest up, enjoy the weekend and face Monday head-on.  Thank you Jocelyne (and everyone else) for sharing your stories. They are an inspiration and something to strive for. I've never encountered a community of such strong women before!   ~Lee",

My surgeon is at a conference for the remainder of the week, but he (thankfully) agreed to let his nurse call me with initial results and then I'll meet with him for a follow-up on Monday. They said I can expect to hear from the nurse either tomorrow or Friday. I hate this waiting game... ",
