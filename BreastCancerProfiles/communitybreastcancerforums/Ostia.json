I am so anxious about this that I can't imagine waiting that long! I am trying to tell myself that if the doc/radiologists had been seriously concerned they would have moved the appointment up, but still, I don't know what to do with myself in the meantime. : (  Is it really normal to have to wait this long??

It does seem that that waiting thing is pretty standard, though, based one everyone's responses.That makes me feel a little better (although I am still SO anxious to get this over with!!).

I have decided to stick with this center (ie, not go somewhere else to have the procedure), and I'm choosing to take the fact that they aren't rushing to fit me in as a good sign... *crossing fingers* Beesie--I, too, was surprised she didn't just do the aspiration on the spot, but I believe the issue was that I have so many cysts/lumps/ fibrotic changes that she didn't want to attempt the aspiration w/out ultrasound guidance, to amke sure she got the right one (oy!)...also she wanted to make sure the lump disappeared after being aspirated, I guess. I don't know how I'm going to deal with having such lumpy, fibrotic breasts as I move into my 40s and into a higher-risk age group. From now on I will be seeing the breast specialist for a physical exam every 6 months, and she told me she'd do her best to get me screening ultrasounds regularly...I guess that's about all I can do??? Argh..... Thanks again and best to you all, Ostia",

      "Content": "Ostia wrote: Hi all, So, I met with a breast specialist at NYU Cancer Center after getting my abnormal sonogram (1cm mass that is was described as hypoechoic with through transmission, no architectural distortion, \"probably\" a complex cyst, BIRAD 4). The dr was very nice, reviewed my films, gave me a physical exam, answered all my questions, etc. She told me she'd call the finding a BIRAD 4a (mildly suspicious), said the only questionable thing about it was that it was hypoechoic (everything else looked normal to her), and that it was called a BIRAD 4 only to make sure it was aspirated, just in case. In short, she was very reassuring and seemed very unconcerned. This all makes me feel better, except that thier radiology dept won't be able to fit me in for the FNA for something like 3 weeks or even more. The nurse said Easter and Passover are slowing things down this month, and that they are also backed up in general. Do you guys think I should go try to get the FNA done sooner somewhere else?? The thing is that i trust this place and would rather stay there, but I don't want to wait that long. Also, if a FNA dosn't work, can they generally do the core needle biopsy right then? I don't want to be waiting ANOTHER 3 weeks if that happens. (Complicating this issue is that my husband and I have been considering trying to have a baby, and obviously all plans for trying to get pregnant are on hold until this thing gets resolved...and given that I just turned 39 and he is about to turn 40, we have NO time to waste....) Thanks all for you your advice...you have been so helpful to me this week!! Ostia [Edited to fix typos] Log in to post a reply",
