My tumor was 8 mm, stage one with three nodes removed and one had a 1/2 mm spot in it. ER + PR - Any advise?

The numbers just did not scream that I need chemo, I am at peace with the decision and feel a big weight lifted. Now, the next phase, I see the Radiation dude next Thursday for the consult. THANK YOU for all your advise and help, it certainly was worth it and helped me sleep at night.",

My doctor had me use absolutely NOTHING during treatment on my skin and then the day I finished, aloe only (I got pure, organic aloe) and am to use it three times a day. I must say, I am doing great! I had two little spots that peeled and were tender so, I used the aloe and then I put a piece of 100% cotton between my breast and bra (another suggestion was to use a mini-pad folded or two put together and then lay between the breast and bra. I have been really comfortable and we are on vacation in the hot south and this cotton is absorbing the sweat as well as giving me some protection. I am really happy with these results. Monday, I go back to my oncologist and see what is next. I really want to look at options rather than just taking the tamoxifen or other medication...but as my husband says---we are in the home stretch now. THANK YOU all for allthe info and support!",
