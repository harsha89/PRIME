      "Content": "Sep 18, 2012 09:02AM PetVet wrote: I was on a clinical trial with Halaven and Herceptin.  They wanted to see how Halaven worked as a first-line drug.  I started in January 2011 and did 9 1/2 cycles (through July).  This was my first chemo so I don't have anything to compare it to. (Three week cycles - herceptin/halaven on day 1, halaven only on day 8, third week off.) As far as side effects - at first I just had some fatigue and constipation.  I received my Halaven with steroids, an anti-nausea drug and benedryl.  The premeds may have been part of the trial (I'm not sure).  At the beginning, my worst SE's were from the steroids they gave me as the pre-med.  I did lose my hair and ended up getting it shaved off.  (I started chemo on January 12 and lost my hair on January 27.)  It started growing back while I was on Halaven though. By early March, I started noticing that my mouth and tongue felt swollen and sore.  This gradually increased with each treatment.  I never actually had any open sores in my mouth.  Just very sore and a severe metallic taste in my mouth. At the end of treatment, I ended up with some neuropathy (tingling toe, change in balance) so we decided to stop. I've read other people's accounts of Halaven and no one else (that I've read) has had the sore mouth or neuropathy.   As far as results, I can't complain.  I started with lung mets too numerous to count with three nodules large enough to measure.  I had CT scans every 6 weeks at the beginning of the trial and had marked regression in the three nodules after just 6 weeks.  Every CT scan since then has showed stable disease.  They're unsure now if the nodules are cancer being held in check by the herceptin only, scar tissue or necrotic tissue.  They only way they can tell is via  a lung biopsy (not big enough to hit with a needle so a no-go for both me and my oncologist) or monitoring for progression via CT scans. I have my next scan in November so have my fingers crossed. Hope this helps.  Like I said, maybe my SEs weren't typical... Julie",

Don't start worrying until you get your biopsy results. ",

You know you did the right thing with Molly but putting an animal down for aggression or behavior causes a huge amount of stress and guilt on the owner. Let yourself grieve and heal... I didn't realize that you were having problems again with C. diff. That sucks. Are they planning to do more diagnostics to determine possible progression or are your CTC's usually pretty accurate? Don't lose hope until you have solid answers! What is happening to you is totally unfair and you have a right to feel the way you do. Julie",

I didn't specifically have Cyberknife but did have SBRT (stereotactic body radiation) the middle of December. I'm not sure but I think the only difference may be the type of machine they use. (FYI - they used the Novalis with me.) I have two persistent mets in my left lung that aren't responding to Herceptin and Perjeta. In December, they measured approximately 3 cm in diameter and were becoming more active on PET scan. The SBRT required me to have gold markers (they call them fiducials) placed in my left lung via bronchoscopy. They then used these fiducials to precisely focus the radiation so it hit only the tumors while avoiding surrounding tissue. Like I said, I had this in December. I had a total of 5 treatments (2 a week). Painless. I won't have a scan until the end of March so am unable to tell you how well it is working. I definitely have my fingers crossed! Julie",

If you have to have breast cancer, DCIS is the \"best\" kind to have because the name itself means the cancer is \"in situ\" or \"in place\" and does not extend past the ducts. Julie ",
