Docetaxel seems to be very risky for good hair regrowth with a goodly percentage of women who don't get their hair back at all - I believe there are law suits all over the world on this. Where there is really slow hair regrowth, or sparse hair growth, over all - unfortunately - it seems to be when docetaxel was one of the chemo drugs. Also arimidex as well as tamoxifen both can cause thinning of the hair as well. :(",

I can really relate to the discouragement relating to our disappointing hair growth.... at the beginning of the treatment I had thought that at the end of the chemo, surgery & radiation I would be able to return to a 'normal life', as it was before.

Today is just over 2 months PFC (9 weeks PFC) I had 4 FEC chemo treatments and 4 docetaxel (which I learned only after end of chemo, can cause permanent baldness). Hair: To see me today you would still simply see me as a 'skin head', clearly for instance being able to see the veins beneath the skin. It would be hard to see hair on my head standing 4 inches away. I look like an 80 year old man. However, end of 7 weeks PFC a small bit of white/transparent baby hair showed up around my ears. Now - end of week 9 PFC - it has sprouted over much of my head (except for right at the top/front). This is hopeful but it is still merely like a 'film' of minuscule white hairs. According to some cancer forums & posts, this is what sprouts a month or two before 'real hair' comes in. (Hair around ears had been minuscule but have lengthened.) I still am very anxious and depressed and worried that I may suffer permanent baldness but at least there is \"something happening\" on the head. Teeny-tiny hair in some places along eyebrow path. No eye lashes yet. Can anyone relate to my experience and provide hope that I will get 'real hair' once again??? .",

Latisse is a commercial venture - sold by speciality shops. You apply Latisse along the edge of the eye where the lashes are -not in the eyes - no Rx needed. Latisse was developed by the same company (I believe) that came up with the glaucoma drops. It was after they discovered that a 'side effect' of the glaucoma drops was that people's eye lashes got longer and darker and stronger. They realized there was a market for this so developed the product sold commercially. Very expensive but worth it. I just googled my city and Latisse and it gave me the locations where it is sold. Hoping this is helpful.",
