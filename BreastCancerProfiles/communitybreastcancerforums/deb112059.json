I had missed the last 5 years. One night I told my husband that I just felt like I needed to go for my mammo. No reason, just a gut feeling. I have been told that I have extremely dense breast. I made the appt. and to make a long story short. Had to go back for ultra sound and then back for biopsy. I had a small calcification in left breast just behin the nipple and a cyst that they were not concerned about but also had several cysts in my axillary on same side. I knew about those cysts. I have them under both arms. I still do and they do stay sore some. Got the call that it was benign but they needed me come back in 6 months to see if any change had occured. They did place a marker in as well. My question is, Do I really need to return? I was suppose to go back last month but I'm not sure about it. I am still paying off the balance and don't want to keep racking up bills everytime. I just wonder what the chances are that the diagnosis would change in 6 months. Cysts are still in axillary but are in both sides. My family are pushing me to go back. Thank you all.",
