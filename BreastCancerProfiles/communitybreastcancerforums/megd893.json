Is there anything you can reccomend I could do for her?? I've been reading as much as I can, and have taken note to take a blanket from home (in case she's cold for the trip home), and a sports bra that clasps (a little bigger than her regular ones)... Any help, guidance, suggestions, words of wisdom would be much appreciated.  Thanks so much... Log in to post a reply",

I do have one other question though... she was told that the procedure tomorrow, the removal of the lump, is going to take 3 hours.  It seems so long!  Is this something any of you faced?  Were yours this long?  Is it the norm/necessary??",

I got a frantic call from my mom on Thursday after her appointment.  Apparently when they did the ultrasound to locate the lump (to do the wire insertion) they couldnt find it! It wasn't where it was last week.  They're now thinking its moved into her upper chest instead of near her armpit.  Because they couldnt locate it, they sent her home without the wire and said the surgeon/doctor would be intouch that evening with some info.  We never heard from him, and when we followed up on Friday morning, we still didnt speak to him. Finally at about 10:15am we spoke to his assistant who informed us the surgery had been cancelled (she was to have the surgery at noon).  No information, no nothing.  It was just cancelled.  Something about not wanting to do exploritory surgery when he didnt know where the lump was.  She now has an appointment with him tomorrow morning.  So we wait. ",
