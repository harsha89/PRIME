They're a research/teaching hospital, and when it comes to the newest techniques and procedures, they're always on the cutting edge. They are also a designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, and in my opinion, you won't find a BETTER place to get cancer care than at Mayo.",

I had a very large pimple just all of a sudden appear overnight right under my armpit that I felt in the shower.  It hurt, and I put some benzoyl peroxide on it, and it did shrink, but it took a while for it to go away.  Just a week before this pimple appeared, I saw my dr for a regular checkup and she gave me a clinical breast exam and that pimple wasn't there at that time.  2 months later I saw a nurse at the breast clinic and told her about this (by that time the pimple was all but gone) and the nurse said it could have been either acne or a boil, because she could see where it had been.",

If the lump is a cyst, it will naturally collapse down after that, and it uses a thinner needle. A biopsy (as in core needle) uses a thicker needle and draws actual tissue from the lump, not only cells. Neither procedure hurts. The surgeon or radiologist numbs the area, but the initial injection of local anesthetic feels like an insect bite at most. After that, you don't feel a thing. The procedure is done right in the office, you're awake the whole time, and you don't have to fast. Everytime the radiologist did something, she asked me if it hurt. I told her no, she said \"good, that's the answer I want to hear.\"",
