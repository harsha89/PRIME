I have BPPV (benign positional vertigo) which is triggered by head movement - in my case when laying on the table with my head pointed to the right at a 45 degree angle. Consider whether or not you have some inner ear issues. The nausea comes with the dizziness.",

I have a first cousin who tested positive late last year and has since had a bi-lateral mastectomy and her ovaries removed. Neither of us had brothers or sisters, or surviving parents or aunts to talk to about family histories or genetic mutations, so it made sense to get tested. I admit I am relieved to be negative, although I don't think I will ever be sure which is best in my situation: mastectomy vs radiation/hormone therapy. I knew it increased the risk of prostate cancer for men, but did not know about the increased melanoma risk. Paco - I reviewed my Consent for Radiotherapy this morning and noticed for the first time that I could opt out at any time - which I agree is comforting - and that I'd be getting a CT scan ( I wondered why you and Veeder were talking about scans...). Reading through the list of potential side effects is chilling. Still, I know so many people who have gone through this without ill effects. Maternal and paternal aunts have had DCIS - radiation was not kind to one of them, but it was a 20 years or more ago, and the RO assures me things have changed. :) Honestly, until I was diagnosed I never knew DCIS existed, or that there were so many variations of breast cancer. How quickly we become schooled. Since my diagnosis I have two friends in Atlanta who have been diagnosed with DCIS, and know three more who have had it - some foregoing radiation, some nixing hormone therapy, some doing exactly was the doctors ordered. It's crazy, how prevalent this disease is. I suppose until you have it, or have gone through it with someone, you just have no idea how many decisions have to be made, how impossible it seems to make the right one, or how grateful you can feel that things are not worse. I was trying to come up with the right analogy for how I felt yesterday when the geneticist called with my results. It was something like exchanging a pogo stick for a unicycle - i.e. a little easier. ",

Boost 1 of 5 today - I got to see the clips, but am still mystified by the .02mm anterior margin. The RO and all the therapists were there to review the films with me, and I could see the area of radiation and know it made sense to them, but over and over when I ask where is that .02mm piece of skin, they don' t know - they say the SO didn't know either, only that it was on the skin side of the tissue they removed. They explained the tissue is sliced into 32nds and looked at under a microscope - that of the 1.5 cm sample, the .02mm positive margin was somewhere near the skin. So - that explains their overall boost area, which includes the nipple and scar. I just thought they (meaning the SO, the pathologists, the RO, etc.) would know specifically where that margin was, due to the \"ink,\" the \"clips,\" and the \"trail\" they tell me they've left. Since the SO said it was in the upper-outer quadrant, I'd think they'd point there, but I get that they need to include the nipple and the scar. For piece of mind, I am going to send the SO a note via patient portal to look at the films the RO is using and assure the margin he was talking about is included - he'd the one who SAW where there was no more tissue to take, WHERE it was.",

I went to Marshall's after my first boost and bought a few dresses, so - my reward. BOOSTS: 1 of 5 down. Yeah! Attaching an updated drawing of what's happening on my chest, which, with the addition of the boost markers, now resembles a game of Hangman. I am having an online conversation with my SO about the margin, which he confirms only as somewhere within the lumpectomy cavity, all of which is being irradiated. <sigh> He's great, and patient, so I sent another note stating I didn't feel like I was communicatingwhat I wanted to know well. I tried again with this: If my lumpectomy cavity were a circle covered in skin, where, from your point of view, would that .02mm dot of dirty margin be - to the side, in the middle? We will see what he says. Paco - we are sharing this experience cosmically somehow - the questions! The non-answers! LOL Mine was only 1.5 all added up after two lumpectomies. Ugh! Marigold - yeah!!! And, yep on who views the scans, etc. The RO, had to bring them up with the techs in the room today. And the SO, when he replied, said he did not have access to their scans. Hm. Still, he did say they would cover the entire lumpectomy cavity, and I clearly on the scan with the RO how far outside that cavity they were going with boosts - far enough. I just want to know where that darned margin is. Petey - thank you for sharing that, it's always good to be reminded I'm not the only one getting the runaround from insurance, schedulers, et al. All in all, it's going pretty well. I can tell how tense I am by how I react to these incidents - sometimes well, sometimes not. Have a great weekend everyone. Love and peace.",

Your post is gorgeous - we can find so many things to be grateful for among all the fear and anxiety. Thank you so much for sharing this positive message. Your gratitude changes the lives of everyone you mention, and those of us who read it. Post-rads breast recovery: Three weeks after my last boost my skin is starting to peel. Not like a sunburn peel. The whole-breast and boost area both turned pink, then red, then brownish tan (boost area looked almost bruised). I kept (and continue to keep) generous amounts of Aquaphor on it all day, using a nursing pad inside the smoother/shaper/sports bra to keep the grease off my clothes. My nipple was so brown I thought it bizarre - but then a few days ago while washing off the aquaphor during my evening shower, I used the washcloth on my breast and pink skin began to show through. Thus, my ultra-hydrated radiated breast skins literally washing off in the shower. Last night the underarm and boost area began to show pink splotches after shower. I'm going to keep using the aquaphor until the brown is gone. Bonus: the lumpectomy incision is barely visible three weeks after rads and the nipple shedding the brown skin. It's looking very good. Hope this helps. Thinking of you all chugging along to the end. Stick with it. Be good to yourselves, let people help you - it will be a kindness to all involved. Peace and hugs xox",

Dodge - I'd be grumpy too if I went through a mastectomy and found the nodes after. Ugh. So glad though, about the Oncotype score. No chemo is good!!! And rads aren't that bad. A heads-up for post-rads treatment: don't stop your skin care treatment. Eight days after boosts I had to revert back to generous amounts of Aquaphor due to the continued reddening/burning of my nipple post-rads. The entire nipple turned brown, swelled, began to peel. I reverted back to the smoother bra with a nursing pad inside, and lots of Aquaphor. This lets me moisturize the breast and wear normal clothes in public. It's really helping - no itching, and the brown skin is sloughing off inside the pad a little at a time. Thus far no need for any medicated treatment. Reposting this photo of the smoother bra (no wires) and nursing pad I slide in - lifesaver during and post-rads for keeping nipple lubricated ",

As everyone says, they should have all of your pathology labs, etc. I found it hard to be lucid enough to ask questions and had a friend with me. Here are some questions I wish I'd know to ask the first time: 1. What is the stage, grade, and type of my cancer? 2. What are my surgical and/or treatment options? 3. Are there differing prognosis' for each treatment option? If so, what? 4. How much time do I have to make a decision? 5. Will you be referring me on to a Radiation Oncologist, and a Medical Oncologist? If so, who? 6. If I am having surgery, how long should I plan to be away from work/resting at home? 7. Are their any social workers assigned to me at this hospital? (social workers will get you through red tape, counseling etc., take advantage) These should give you the information you need to make a decision on what your path will be. The choices are different for everyone - but we all share the same fear. I think it's normal to feel that way. I have a good friend who has been living with Stage 4 brain cancer for years now - he's on hormone therapy at an NCI in Denver. He tells me: just do what your doctor says. I've followed his advice - but have never stopped asking questions about my treatment. I was an anxious and bitchy patient, I'm sure the radiology department couldn't wait for me to get through radiation, initially - cancer is scary and I wanted to know every detail about what they were aiming their laser beams at, etc. - but bless them, they were as committed as I was, and we all cried at the end. You are about to meet some of the heroes of your life. These forums helped me tremendously. I hope you find them useful, too. Good luck and let us hear from you.",

Hitting on my nerves a little. BILLING - For my sanity I've decided to not look at anything online from my insurance company unless I get an EOB (from them) with a corresponding bill (from Emory). I maxed out of pocket expenses in January, so if I get a bill someone would have gone out of network without my knowledge, which would be awful. I already have to file a dispute/appeal with BCBS for telling me (and their own BCBS nurse, who did the investigating for me) the Genetics lab was in network, and then sending a letter stating they were out of network. When I called the nurse back to ask WTH, she agreed her own customer service rep told her it was in network, but I'd have to file a dispute. So I get to talk with these people on the phone, which hits on my nerves a LOT. Just about everything involved with breast cancer is a stressor - they come in wave after wave. I've often thought there was such a gap in the great care we receive in person, while the people who don't have to face us are less accountable for their actions and are the cause of a lot of anguish. It seems cruel, but how to fill that gap, I don't know....",

I wanted to have something meaningful to say, and - more than anything - try and help take the fear out of a diagnosis. As a writer it's typical of me to essay things, and since this forum figures in to my journey it gets a mention and I'm posting it here. *** This was accompanied by my stick figure drawing of radiation tape that looked like hangman. Here goes: Hangman \u2013 my cancer treatment on an envelope. *not to scale... On day 21 of 21 consecutive visits to Emory's Department of Radiation Oncology, I lay on the table for my last radiation treatment and ugly-cry for the first time since being diagnosed with breast cancer. When it's over we all head out to the lobby for the ceremonial ringing of the bell that signifies someone is done with treatment. I cry again, my team cries, Denise \u2013 who has been with me through all of this \u2013 cries and takes pictures of us crying. I have been a frightened and bitchy patient. For the past five weeks Tony, Travis and Bridget (along with a rotation of medical students) have literally had my heart and my lungs in their hands as they radiated everything around them to kill any stray cancer cells leftover from two preceding surgeries. It's taken five months, but I am ready to talk about my breast cancer diagnosis. First and foremost: I am ok \u2013 thanks to a list that starts with a radiologist who noticed a small cluster of 3 microscopic calcifications on my routine annual mammogram back in November. How lucky am I? I really mean that: what if she blinked, sneezed, tweeted or was overworked or bored? I see it all the time in every profession \u2013 but thankfully, not this one, not this time. In less than a week after learning of this \"suspicious\" area, I am subjected to a diagnostic mammogram, which confirms the suspicions and several days later rushes me into a brutal stereotactic biopsy that removes the calcifications and several other core samples of tissue from the surrounding area. Less than a week later I hear the C word: you have breast cancer, caught at the earliest stage. This is only mildly reassuring at first, because cancer is a scary word and I am reeling and grossly unprepared for the decisions I will have to make very quickly with information that is new and foreign to me. In a two-week period of time, I get a crash course in stages and grades of cancer, words and acronyms, and whether my particular type of cancer warrants a mastectomy of both breasts or lumpectomy of one \u2013 the former meaning radical surgery and long convalescence; the latter less invasive surgery but the addition of intentionally radiating my body and taking a medication to keep me cancer-free for the next five years. And I have to make this decision immediately because cancer is inside me, eating my breast tissue and leaving a trail of calcifications behind. I would happily have my breasts removed if it gave me a better outcome \u2013 but as it turns out, the outcome is the same whichever I choose: the prognosis remains the same. Neither path is appealing. I don't want cancer, that is my choice. Hahahaha, says my Surgical Oncologist: choose. I have a great SO, Dr.Arciero. The very first time he saw me he said it was ok to keep my housecoat on in the cold examination room \u2013 only it wasn't a housecoat, it was a long, fashionable hand-stitched cardigan. Is your first name really Cletus? I answered. He operated on me twice, as it turned out. The non-invasive tumor is larger than first thought. He is patient and professional and deadpan funny in his answers as I ask ill-informed questions about the benefits of radiation and recurrence, and if mastectomy would be a better option after all. I ask over and over. He answers. When all of this was happening a lot of other things were happening \u2013 the heroes of my daily life were identifying themselves. Number 1: Denise Sheriff, who upon learning of my diagnosis said I'm your person. And she has been there for every surgery, the beginning and end of radiation, many days and nights with the calm, patient understanding it took to cancer-speak, most especially when I could not. At home, Rhonda, Lisa and Hope kept me in beautiful flowers and luxury comfort items. The men fed us: neighbor Sara brought husband Zack's lasagna and stacks of sugar cookies; Steve brought homemade chicken pot pie, chili, hambone soup; Don brought beef stew; Walter brought pints and pints of Haagen Dazs ice cream and expired tapioca. At work, Anna kept up my spirits every day and offered to be the scissors on any red tape I encountered. Margi gave me a place in her home the night before the first surgery; Brett drove through snow like a boss to bring me home when snow shut down Atlanta and the first surgery was canceled. The lovely, faraway people who were present in words and cards and conversation \u2013 you know who you are and how much I appreciate you. When breast cancer enters your life, you become aware of how much it affects other people. Three women close to me in my life are undergoing breast cancer treatment at the same time as me. Another old and dear friend lives with a metastatic head cancer that will never be gone, but managed on a daily basis. And I mean uncannily \u2013 none of us knew the other had been diagnosed. They can identify themselves if they'd like, but sisterhood and brotherhood, we share fear and hope and life. And my breastcancer.org community sisters in February surgery and March radiation \u2013 we went through this together, first as strangers, and now as women with a common bond who are choosing to continue on the journey through all of our next steps. I offer hand drawings of the magic marker and tape road map of my chest, necessary for radiation. They laugh. We lift each other up. For all of you who have known about my illness, sent your thoughts and good wishes, sent your prayers around the world \u2013 thank you for respecting my privacy until I was ready to talk about this. Radiation is not the end of the road for me. After Surgical and Radiation Oncology, Medical Oncology is next. I will most likely take a hormone therapy for at least 5 years, if not for life, that will starve any future cancer cells out of existence. Or at least prevent them from growing. More than anything, these past few months have been a heartfelt lesson of the best that humankind has to offer. I am the grateful recipient of grace and compassion when I most needed it \u2013 the silver lining of fear and anger and uncertainty. As cancers go, I got the best bad news one can get. My cancer was noninvasive, which gives me a head start in living whatever my normal lifespan will be. The message I get from this all is that today should not be squandered. All my life I've worked to build a solid enough foundation to swan dive into my reward: a calm and peaceful life filled with simple beauty. Whether it is two days or two decades, I dive now. Life is for living NOW. Love and peace. xox",

Veeder - so glad to know your mom is better. And a short vacation sounds lovely. Lots of you are talking about skin irritation and wounds. I'm joining that conversation. 8 days after the last boost the entire boost area was a startling red - most especially the nipple area. The areola turned brown and the bumps inside the areola (what are those?) swelled. So I had sore red BBs all around the nipple, which was like a jellybean. Two days ago I reverted back to keeping generous amounts of Aquaphor on the boost area and wearing the smoother bra with a nursing pad inside to keep it all concentrated in the burn area. It's working great - the brown skin beginning to slough off inside the nursing pad, leaving new pink skin beneath. The whole-breast skin is pretty dark. Each skin blemish, mole, skin tag (ew), etc is also enhanced and obvious. I never knew I had so many. Under my boob is a swath of these darkened bits, which are now, also, starting to peel off. The lesson for me: the burning, tanning, pinking keeps on for a period of time after rads are done - don't stop slathering.",

I'd say the swelling and seroma sacks and scar tissue have really benefitted from this. But I am finding that my breast area tightens up quickly and easily. This makes it seem like my breast is sore to the touch or certain movement, when really if I do my stretching exercises it is all fine again. I'm sure this is a SE of radiation. Anyone else experiencing? I have no idea if I am \"massaging\" correctly. Because my hands are attached to my body (rather than the body of someone standing over me), my massage movements are limited. So mostly I feel like I am squeezing and pushing. Anyone get better instructions than I did?",

I am 2 months out from completing radiation therapy, and the only thing I wish I'd known more about is post-rads Physical Therapy and/or massage to help with scar tissue build-up or seromas. Put that on your list! People react differently to rads - I'd recommend just giving yourself a head start with diet and exercise. Keep limber and stretch - especially the affected breast/arm area (with doctors consent, of course). Good luck - it will fly by!",

I sat with the RO and the same SO resident whose been there during my two lumpectomies, and said, again, please explain how DCIS can only live in ducts but you've taken all the tissue you can from the anterior margin, where a duct no longer lives, and yet somehow DCIS still exists. <crickets> No one can answer this question. Veeder - are you starting your rads on the 7th or next week? I need to ask about the \"prone\" thing. My RO also talked about practicing deep breaths to keep my heart healthy during radiation.

Radiation keeps cooking for a couple of weeks after the last treatment. My breast turned colors, felt a little burned, and was swollen. But nothing soft bras and aquaphor didn't take care of. I took generic naproxen for aches and pains if needed. It does seem to be different for everyone, so you won't know how your body will react until you're in the process. Keep your breast moisturized and soft bras, etc. But if I had gone on a cruise (I wish) three days after rads, I would have been fine.

I'm starting 2 of 5 boosts tomorrow and will be DONE on Thursday. 21 treatments in all. Same back, breath hold, stickers and no tats. I'm starting to burn a bit, but nothing compared to some I've seen. I post mostly in the March Rads group, since that's when I started, but wanted to repost something in here for the April ladies who had lumpectomies or non-reconstruction mastectomies, and are undergoing rads, can wear a soft bra and need to keep the breast lubricated after treatment. Lumpectomy ladies who will start rads soon: this may be old news, but was news to me - how to keep my sore, radiated, lumpectomied boob stationary and moisturized. First off, I kept my breast stationary 24/7 the first few days after lumpectomy and always at night by wearing a sports bra of some kind. With radiation I wear small men's Hanes tees at night to keep the Aquaphor in check, but did not know what to wear when out during the day without a grease spot. Then, duh, breastfeeding pads (note stickers on the outside for interior of bra) are just the right size for my boost area and fit perfectly inside this soft bra. Skinny Girl smoother and shaper + pads + calendula ointment (or whatever you are using for rads burns) = just right. Hope this helps - it's been a saving grace for me. ",

Anyway, day 2 was normal. And as I told all the medical-like folks in the room (and there seemed to be so many, teaching hospital) who wondered it it was ok to laugh at a half-naked woman with a dead arm and a Basquiat painting magic marketed on her chest: whatever it takes. I've started using the calendula and aquaphor, as preventative treatments, but no difference after 2 days. I felt a bit tingly in the irradiated area, a bit stiff. Thanks to all of you, I'm ready for any number of possibilities. Bring it on. (but not too on...) Protein! I am not a vegetarian, but I eat quinoa every week - it's a staple in my house because of the versatility, refrigerates well, and so many tasty mix-ins. I work four long hard days in downtown Atlanta every week and like to have my breakfast and lunch ready to grab and go in the mornings. So I eat quinoa for lunch a lot. Two of my favorites: first of all, make a batch of quinoa (1 cup of quinoa to boil in 1 3/4s cup water, bit of salt). Cover, let cook for 15 minutes. Remove from heat. (check to assure all water is gone - these are times and temps that work on my gas range). Now the mixers: 1. while still warm, move quinoa to a large bowl. Add 1 cup frozen peas, stir well let sit 5 minutes. Stir in a drizzle of good tasty EVOO. Let cool. Zest one lemon into the bowl. Chop up a bunch of parsley and mix everything. This is delicious and nutritious on many levels. 2. In room temp quinoa, add chopped mint (I use all the leaves from the plastic container sold in supermarkets), several small green onions sliced very thin (or chopped chives), and 1/3 cup crumbled feta cheese. Mix well.  ",

I love how you expressed your experience with the gratitude journal. I am taking it to heart and will begin this exercise today. Nancy, ugh re the nausea. Side effect of radiation? I ask because I was blessed with vertigo yesterday afternoon after rads, which has made me nauseous. I have a history of BPPV, so this is not new - but wonder if it's rads related this time.What are you doing for it? Marigold - I'm so sorry. I completely get it. As everyone here says, and we both know, it's normal. It's just sometimes hard to remember it's normal when it's so contrary to how you usually feel and live your life. <hugs> Veeder, Petey, metoo - thank you for your support ladies. I'm off to 7/21 today. One-third of the way through. I'll close this message with a weird little story: I checked in to 6/21 rads yesterday, walked into the waiting room and saw a second cousin sitting there. She said she had breast cancer, I was like me, too. Turns out we were diagnosed at the same time, with the same breast cancer (including ER/PR+), at the same hospital, both had two lumpectomies, using the same RO, rads on the same day, at the same exact time. How completely unbelievable is that? And today: I stopped by a wig shop to try on colors (I want to let my highlighted hair grow out and am at the colorist tomorrow), and the Non-English speaking Korean woman who owns the shop sawmy chest etchings managed to communicate that she, too, had breast cancer. By her hand gesture I know she had a mastectomy and a DIEP flap. The universal language of breast cancer. Peace out, stay strong, keep writing. Xoxox",

Now that I have had two days at home I feel much more relaxed and realize how much the train commute and work environment were adding to my stress. The week after next I will leave work for 3-4 weeks - chipping away at the stressors. I hope you have some options to help chip away at yours. A long commute doesn't seem fun, but for sleeping in your own bed? The kitties? An AirBNB room on a weekly basis could be much more affordable than a hotel, plus you get a home environment? I did AirBNB a lot when it was new, Manhattan at $60 a night for example. I never had a problem. And last: the mammogram vs ultrasound vs CT, etc. still baffles. For the benign cyst last Monday they did both a mammogram and ultrasound. Nothing on mammogram, very obvious cyst on ultrasound. Yet a regular wellness mammogram is what revealed the microcalcifications that lead to my diagnosis. It's confusing. I will always ask in the future - why this instead of that? I will irritate the radiologists I'm sure because it will seem obvious to them. But not to us - so I will ask. Wishing you some peace in the midst of all this. Veeder - is it worthwhile to check out your AirBNB options close to treatment? If either of you decide to do this let us know. We could be on to something. Gratitude for home goes into my gratitude journal! Paco - I've experienced a bit of tingling every time after treatment. Nothing terrible and it goes away quickly. Flowergal - hi! metoo - you summarized it beautifully. Such larger issues in a world of cancer issues. I sat next to a chatty Liberian woman in the rads waiting room this week who was in for rads after a brain tumor - we talked for 20 minutes before I realized she couldn't see me. The tumor had affected her optic nerve. She was funny and uplifting and teased me about having two breasts as compared to her one brain. I STILL need to look up the name of that radiologist back in November who noticed those three little calcifications on the otherwise unremarkable routine mammogram pictures. That radiologist could have easily sneezed, looked at a text or just been dialing it in that day. But they found this i me, and I truly intend to send a thank you note. Happy Easter everyone, however you celebrate. With love and admiration, Kay",

I know this is rads thread, but I doubt anyone else is reading this, and it relates to what we are talking about nine months after meeting! Here goes: I was diagnosed with osteopenia at the same time I had the suspicious mammogram last year. Fast forward 12 months and my MO took me off anastrozole for a month, then onTamoxifen - why? Because I had a pretty bad dryness reaction vaginally. I understood the SEs of both (i.e. potential for osteoporosis on one, cervical or uterine cancer on the other). Well, I had a baseline uterine ultrasound last month, which my GYN wanted to do considering I had started Tamoxifen. The ultrasound was not normal. I had fluid in my uterus, which is not good. She did a cervical biopsy immediately and my cervix was SEALED SHUT about an inch in. She tried dilating it, but eventually had to just force the instrument in - big pop and she was inside. She got what she needed, I was terrified for a few days, and the results were benign fluid. I spoke with my MO just after this. She still felt that there was really no difference between estrogen blockers for me. She felt the cervical atrophy was due to the blockers, period, and the only reason any fluid filled the uterine cavity was because it could not get out. Even so, I switched back to anastrozole. I rationalized that I'd rather worry about osteoporosis than cervical cancer. She didn't argue. FWIW. Happy new year to everyone - wishing us all a MUCH less terrifying year than the one we've just had. On the upside - it was a good lesson in gratitude. PS - on the subject of gratitude, I published my first novel! You can go to my name dot com - i.e. Kay Spencer to read the first literary review, along with some other articles about the process and breast cancer. If you are on a phone, you can use the radio button to go to the HOME page and look around. I'm on Amazon, Apple, and B&N, too. If it's your genre, I hope you read it. It's full of love and loss and grief and how wherever the road takes us, we are always traveling with everything we need.  ",

My left arm had to be up in the mold they made, understandably, but this first time they took what seemed like dozens of X-rays to line things up for the treatment. My arm was absolutely dead, no circulation, they had to stop and let it down. The RO laid it over my face and told me to move my fingers - nothing. Just dead weight on my face. It was awful. Anyway, that is supposed to be a onetime thing and feeling came back within minutes of sitting up. My fingers were blue! About my Grays: 16 whole breast at 2.66 Grays, followed by 5 boosts at 2.2 Grays. So yes, for me it seems accelerated. Nancy, thank you. I do have tape a clear plastic circles over an increasing number of colorful magic marker maps on my chest. From the belly button to just beneath my arm pits I look like I've been attacked by a kindergartener. Petey - I have even more tape today, a big rectangular addition over a soccer field of black magic marker. And yes, it all stays on. No problems with that so far. Perhaps it will be in the getting it off? Thank you for the good wishes. Paco, you are so sweet. And I agree, I.m so grateful for all of you. Feline, we are on the same schedule.

Part of this is my schedule - I'm on a train for downtown at 6 a.m. every day, panhandled before and during the ride, and no one has cleaned up the area around the station downtown so early, which is surrounded by smokers and littered with chicken bones, liquor bottles and urine (that's Five Points). I usually get off one stop before and walk a much longer way to avoid this, but it's been too dark and cold lately. I am working half days to accommodate radiation, so that time is frenzied trying to do what I would normally do in a full day. Same train back home (fewer panhandlers in your face), then the drive back into Atlanta for rads, which have been running late so far and leave me stuck in traffic on the way home. The other part of this is, of course, the challenge of health care - not only the emotional challenge of dealing with breast cancer, but the administrative errors and hijinks of not only the medical facility, but also the insurance company (whose own nurse assigned to my case is mystified), and my employers HR department. So much unnecessary stress on the patient - all of which could be remediated if only people would do the job they are assigned correctly. It's been more challenging to create peace and calm with this schedule and these human administrative roadblocks. But it's my brain and I have a choice about how I perceive things, so need to get my peace back, adjust to rad schedule, and always remember: I can't control most of this stuff, to save my energy for what I can control, rads and commutes and irresponsible people are going to be there whether I like them or not, so live happily instead of angrily. Ok - vent over. I'm only working half days next week, too - then OFF for the remaining rads and recovery. That should help enormously! As metoo says, this too shall pass. mjb - that's part of it, too: it's been a four-month assault so far, it's bound to wear on us at some point - at least until we rebuild a supply of resilience! Paco, INF, thanks for even saying its ok to vent - that helps. Veeder - exactly. Thanks again for listening, you're all amazing and inspiring. Getting back on topic: I don't own a single non-underwire bra; I need a supply of cheap white t-shirts to accommodate the greasy left boob stains of Aquaphor when I sleep at night; someone gave me a copy of Lavender Hair (Victoria Jackson) which I am ready to pass on to anyone who wants it - I'll pay shipping costs wherever you are.

I did that this morning, it works great, and I have one less thing to worry about now! Beaver - I concur: I've only been wearing a bra approximately 5 hours a day (at work). I can get away with going braless (small cup size) but have felt vulnerable since the lumpectomies and radiation. I feel better having my breasts semi-confined with a came or sports bra-type garment. Under-breast shingles sounds painful, btw! Feline - <hugs> ugh. I've had so many admin/communication hijinks - it was my downfall last week, I just couldn't cope with one more thing. One of my pet peeves has grown to be conflicting information between oncologists and their staff, as well as their inability to contact me without it being a scene from The Three Stooges. This is not all communications, nor all of the (wonderful) people I am working with - but enough to raise eyebrows and irritate me often. I did not know it was called a bolus - I curse mine often - however my spine was curved on the day they molded it, it is not curved that way now and digs into my back during rads. Paco - the mystery of the X-rays. My radiation techs did say it was different per clinic. I don't blame you for wondering and completely stand behind you asking until they answer you in a way that makes sense to us as patients, rather than radiologist technicians. That said, I fear I am the squeaky wheel, too, but I'm persistent. I just tell them \"I know I am asking lots of questions - I'm sure I'm not the first to do so - I need to understand what is happening.\" They either get it or not as human beings, but as professionals I expect them to answer.

The RO added her own side-boob drawing to show how the boost would skim the entire anterior quadrant where the dirty margin was - this is going to include the nipple, which is starting to burn a bit. The dark spot on the side-boob is her depiction of the seroma that filled with water after the lumpectomies - which they also use to track where to radiate, along with the clips the surgeon would have left there. I want to see those clips and that seroma! They will have the film up for me on Friday morning before the boost, with the RO there to point the way. Enjoy my artwork. ",

This helps. Everyone should take a look: http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/hormonal/com...

Here is the publication that link came from, can anyone translate it for us? :) : https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28415634 Another link Beesie sent me is below - but the first one opens to a Medscape portal that requires an account. Her comment is in italics below. The second link that should be a pdf won't open for me. It looks like it is in Mexico? RCT: Menopause Symptoms Mistaken for Tamoxifen Side Effects This is the most significant study done on Tamox and women with DCIS. It's not specific to post-menopausal women, but on page 6, you can see the side effects, with a side by side comparison of those who took a placebo vs. those who took Tamoxifen (I don't think the link works but try googling those words; you want the PDF of the full report): Tamoxifen in treatment of intraductal breast cancer: National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B-24 randomised controlled trial metoo and marigold - thank you for sharing your hormone therapy experience. The side effects of each AI (for both post and peri-menopausal) are listed in the chart in the link Nancy sent (above). None of these SEs are fun, but certainly some of them seem to have fewer than others. I do not know what makes a MO prescribe one over the other for us post-menopausal ladies. I do not have an appt with an MO until May 2, so will arm myself with some of the questions we are beginning to ask here. Besides side effects, I also need to know what my insurance company will cover IN WRITING since they've changed their minds on covering the lab they sent me to for genetics testing. (The joy of an appeal....) My last boost is tomorrow. Yeah!!! I saw a social worker at the hospital today (thanks for the suggestion Feline), who was appalled at some of the red tape that's going on - she took a copy of my notes. I had to start noting times and dates of phone calls and appointments and what people said back in January because it was so much, and so contradictory at times. She will use this to help train the departments - so perhaps things will be better for others in the future. I hope so. I'm leaving the hospital now - will check in tomorrow.

I seem to be following the same course as far as the continued darkening of the skin from whole breast, and now the red shadow of burn in the boost area. I can see exactly what area comprised the boost now, and for once know that it encompasses every possible are of where my positive margin could have been. (old, long story) I'm sorry you're feeling depressed. I think it's normal after the roller coaster of a cancer diagnosis and treatment. My diagnosis also left me wondering about time left, quality of life. I was VERY direct with my surgical oncologist - don't feed me any BS, etc. He works with breast cancer patients of all ages and stages, but never once made me feel hysterical or silly about wondering, while gently reminding me that my current diagnosis, if I had radiation and hormone therapy, had an almost 96% chance of no recurrence. I'll be watchful in the future, but honestly, after the initial fear abated (it comes and goes), I'm mindful in general that I'm going to die some day of some thing - at most I have 20-30 years left and the time to live is NOW. My SO used a Sloan-Kettering predictor tool for recurrence, which gave scenarios with/without things like radiation, hormone therapy, positive margins, family history, etc. A more scientific approach would be the Oncotype test: http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/testing/types...

I had all of the above until about three weeks out from the last boost. While I never had any open sores or bad blistering, the other traditional radiation symptoms applied. After week three everything began to return to normal. Beyond some tightness and residual lumpiness, my breast has returned to normal. Maybe a new normal, but normal. Massaging to break up seromas and/or scar tissue has been beneficial. Highly recommended when your RO gives the OK.",
