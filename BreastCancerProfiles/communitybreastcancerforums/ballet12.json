MRI might help with this.",

      "Content": "Mar 8, 2015 12:39PM - edited Mar 8, 2015 12:41PM by ballet12 Hi Wrinkle, technically an excisional biopsy is what you call a surgical biopsy done on presumably benign tissue.  If it's already diagnosed as cancer, it would be called a lumpectomy.  You are right that pathologists examine all of the tissue in all circumstances. About doing a biopsy on benign tissue that doesn't show atypical cells (just fibrocystic breast tissue, for example), just be aware that each biopsy creates more scar tissue, which can affect the accuracy/interpretation of future imaging.  Of course, if a surgeon agrees you should do it, then it's fine. Also, you need to get a copy of this and all reports, even if the surgeon will already have a copy.  All of our discussions are moot, until you know exactly what the pathology report says.  ",

So, with your pathology report (which you haven't seen), it's kind of \"benign\" but with an asterisk.  I hope this clarifies things for you.  Once you find out more specific details in your case, you can go on the specific threads which address your needs on this website.  There are many women with diagnoses of ADH, ALH and LCIS (which is also treated as a pre-cancer condition).",

If you have DCIS or IDC, then the SNB would be obvious. Otherwise the risk outweighs the benefit.  If you and the surgeon really feel that your risk of bc is very high, then I certainly wouldn't question your decision about pbmx.  That is a very personal decision, and it sounds like you won't feel comfortable until its done. If you have questions about the risks of SNB, and are comfortable going ahead with the PBMX, then you should go to the threads on mastectomy.  There will be very few people who are doing the prophylactic mastectomies who also get SNB.  Best of luck to you, and I hope that they don't find anything more in the final pathology.  And I hope you will be at peace.  That's what we all want.  A decision that we can live with. ",

DCIS is sometimes found next to an area of ADH, but DCIS doesn't really have positive nodes (unless it is DCIS with microinvasion--and even then it's only 10 percent of that group, or there is occult invasive disease).  I second what Beesie said about the issue of needing to take precautions on whatever side has SNB done, and if it's bilateral, you would need to avoid blood pressure measurements and blood draws , etc. on both sides (need to do the foot for blood draws).  Even individuals with invasive breast cancer on one side, when they do a prophy on the other side, they don't take out nodes on that side.  ",

I've had ADH diagnosed two times, and both times I went to an excisional biopsy.  You really don't know if you have a large area of anything, even ADH.  The calcifications are only nonspecific markers that there is activity in the area.  The calcifications are not the ADH, nor are they DCIS or IDC. These are all findings in the breast ducts, themselves. The calcifications are just markers that there might be something of concern in the area.  I know you have made up your mind to do the PBMX, but you should know that PBMX isn't even the standard procedure for ADH.  There are individuals on these boards who do it, some because of extensive family history or being BRCA positive.  Others have had years of biopsies and surveillance and are tired of that. Others are just very worried. So, it is done, but not for the majority of people with ADH (who don't post here).  Many of us probably have ADH somewhere in the breasts, without knowing it.  It doesn't always lead to cancer. I'd see if you can take a step back to see what you are dealing with, because the procedures are invasive and have lifelong implications, and the SNB is really only necessary if there is invasive disease, or with DCIS with mastectomy, where you can't go back easily to do the SNB, if invasion is found.  Sorry this is so hard. It sounds like you need another meeting with the surgeon before going ahead with this, so that you are completely informed and completely comfortable with what you are doing.",

The other side is considered a prophylactic mastectomy. I would guess that, in your case, if there is greater involvement than ADH, it's likely to be DCIS, especially given the extensive ADH.  It's quite possible that you do have DCIS.  I had a biopsy which showed ADH and the lumpectomy surgery showed lots of DCIS. So, unless they find DCIS with microinvasion, and the small chance of IDC, you would be overtreating to do the sentinel node biopsy. See if they will do the Pink Lotus procedure of marking the nodes but not removing them prior to surgery. Good luck with this.",

Like many others, I do lurk on the Stage IV boards at times, to fully appreciate what women go through in late stage bc. This does not negate, in any way, the tremendous burden placed on those who have received a BRCA diagnosis, both those who have breast cancer and those who fear it.  It forces individuals, many times, very young individuals, to contemplate drastic surgeries to avoid these diagnoses.  The surgeries aren't minor.  I don't care if the scars are small, medium, large, etc.  The surgery, even prophylactic, is very invasive.  As I stated on another thread, those with a BRCA diagnosis have a particular, unique burden because they possess defects in tumor suppression genes that put them at risk for a multitude of cancers;  not only breast and ovarian, but also colon, pancreatic, melanoma, etc (and risk of primary peritoneal cancer--which is the cousin of ovarian cancer).  So, they have the Sword of Damocles over their head even after removing breasts and ovaries. And, as noted by AJ, even after getting the mastectomy, their risk of recurrence is higher than many others for bc (5 percent as opposed to 1 to 2 percent).  So, I won't minimize AJ's situation both pre and post-surgery.  I don't have brca in my family, but several near and dear to me carry the gene, some of whom have suffered greatly.  One of my close friends had both IBC and Triple Negative IDC, and even had a bone marrow transplant when those were done.  She has to have frequent colonoscopies, etc. beyond her fear of recurrence of bc.",

It would not be standard of care to wait for the 6 month follow-up mammo to decide on radiation. The assumption is that the lumpectomy removed the DCIS cells, and the purpose of the radiation is to get rid of any stray cells that might remain. These would probably be microscopic, so they wouldn't likely be visible on the mammo. Many facilities actually have a window of time in which they feel it is acceptable to wait, between the surgery and the radiation. Due to scheduling issues, I actually had a gap of 2 1/2 months from the last surgery to the start of radiation, but I can't imagine that they would want to wait much longer. So, it's just a matter of whether you and your team feel that radiation is appropriate in your case. As beacon said (above), there is a move toward less treatment, so some individuals with small areas of low grade DCIS are able to forego radiation, but if the DCIS is intermediate or high grade and if there's a lot of it, it's less likely that the MD's would OK not having radiation. I also recommend reading all of the general information amassed by Beesie on DCIS and it's treatment. Keep us posted on the consults with the surgeons.",

It's up to you; of course, but maybe you could opt to wait, and get some kind of counseling in the interim to help you get through the time period. It is true that biopsies can cause scar tissue to form, making imaging more difficult. I did have a situation where the radiologist would have waited, but the surgeon wanted to biopsy. This was in the untreated breast, but I guess the surgeon thought I was at greater risk of having DCIS or atypia in the other breast.

You can also ask if you can take some kind of sedating meds, if that's something you want.  Obviously, then you'd need someone to drive you home.  My guess is that they'd be more amenable to the meds than to the person in the room.",

And Grammy, they don't necessarily \"remove\" all of the atypical cells.  They do the excisional/surgical biopsy to determine if there is any DCIS or invasive cancer present.  They were doing that back in 1999, so you could have had the excisional biopsy to follow the stereotactic biopsy, but they didn't recommend it for some reason. I had my first surgical excision in 1995 for atypia.  Your story does prove that atypical cells do put you at risk for cancer, although it's not always true that it appears in the same spot as the atypia.

Rejoice in the benign finding.  Melissa is correct that for this kind of biopsy, they don't \"remove\" the lumps, only biopsy them.  If the findings show either atypia or malignancy, they move on to an excisional biopsy or lumpectomy.  Even with the atypia, they don't remove all of it, only if it's cancer.  About the breast pain, it's most likely not anything serious.  I had discomfort after my stereotactic core biopsy for weeks afterward, compounded by three surgeries afterward, but the hard lump from that very first biopsy is still there. Best of luck to you. ",

Were there other abnormalities noted on imaging that prompted the biopsy and the ADH was found \"incidentally?\" Since you want input from others with ADH, I'll tell my story.  I was diagnosed with ADH and ALH by excisional biopsy after a mammogram showed a linear array of microcalcifications 18 years ago.  I never had a stereotactic biopsy.  I don't even believe they did core biopsies 17 years ago, only fine needle biopsies.  Anyway, I was only monitored with yearly mammos and sonos for a number of years, and then I stopped having sonos.  I never went to a \"high risk\" clinic, just the regular screenings.  I had two additional surgical biopsies on that breast which were benign, and a biopsy attempt on the other breast.  Last year, I had a core biopsy on the breast that had the ADH, and they found ADH again, but the surgical excisional biopsy showed DCIS and lots of it.  I don't regret having had less surveillance than some get for ADH, but I do regret, slightly, that the radiologists didn't really scrutinize the imaging over the past few years.  The surgeon at my latest hospital was surprised that they didn't really carefully study the calcifications that were growing, given the ADH history and family history.  So, the upshot is that there was a lot of DCIS and it required three surgeries to get clean margins.  I AM glad that the radiologist last year (at the same facility) did take the time to examine four years worth of imaging and noted a progression over time.  I think she did a big thing for me, given that the DCIS was high grade, multifocal and with comedonecrosis.  I don't regret never taking Tamoxifen or not having multiple years of MRI's, etc.  I'm still putting off taking hormonals because I've got other health issues which would be challenged by them (as do you, apparently).  I think that many people probably have ADH and never find out about it, and most of the time it doesn't even lead to something. If I were to recommend anything to you, it would be for you to find a high-risk clinic at an NCI-designated facility, where the imaging can be scrutinized very carefully.  So, maybe it's not only how OFTEN one is scanned, but how expert the radiologist is, and frankly, how good the equipment is.  If you are thought of as a high risk patient, they will also read the scans extra carefully. So mammo and sono are not perfect, but they are still good tools in the right hands.",

Maybe the special staining referred to differentiating between ADH and DCIS.  It is sometimes hard to distinguish the two, so they do very careful examination.  I had ADH on the core biopsy and those slides were reviewed by around six pathologists to be sure, and the excisional (open) biopsy found the DCIS.  Again, several pathologists examined the slides to be sure.  They were also re-read at the hospital that I ultimately went to for the rest of my treatment.  When I had an ADH/ALH diagnosis many years ago (on surgical biopsy), I had to slides read again, as a second opinion, by Memorial Sloan Kettering, just to be absolutely sure there wasn't anything else.",

Since you already had a diagnosis of LCIS on both breasts (as I read in the other thread) it is that diagnosis that would put you at more risk for ILC (as well as the family history). You should really post this on the LCIS thread, as there are a couple of \"experts\" on that thread, who do lots of research. I had a diagnosis of ALH and ADH years ago, and later had the same story as you, repeat ADH on core biopsy with the DCIS diagnosis to follow on surgical biopsy. I haven't had anything lobular develop since that earlier ALH diagnosis (20 years ago), although they did say that the DCIS extended into the lobules. I never did anything specific to be followed as \"high risk\" over all those years, other than clinical breast exams and mammography (and sometimes sonography). Anyway, I am sorry that you are going through more scary stuff. Best of luck with the excisional biopsy.",

So, they are going to do a closer \"look-see\", and if they really see something suspicious, they will pursue it. Otherwise, they might have you come back in 6 months to see if there are any changes. In other words, asymmetry doesn't always mean abnormality, it just means that the breasts look different from each other.

In terms of specific biopsy results being related to known increased risk of breast cancer, that's a different story.  Atypical cells (atypical ductal and lobular hyperplasia, and flat epithelial atypia) are related to increased risk of cancer.  I believe that the \"number of biopsies\" issue is correlational not causational. Maybe that related, for example, to the increased risk with extremely dense breasts. It is also known that the mechanical aspect of biopsies--can cause scar tissue--which can make later surveillance potentially more difficult (i.e. reading mammograms, etc.) That is why I am loathe to do a biopsy on a BIRADS-3 problem.  I had one of those biopsies a couple of years ago, but that was because my breast surgeon thought it was prudent to do so.  It was changed to a BIRADS-4 in order to do the biopsy.  I've got a BIRADS-3 right now, with new faint calcifications seen in the area of the lumpectomy bed.  I'm just doing the 6 month follow-up as recommended.",

The most obvious high risk groups are inidividuals who have BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 genes.  Both groups are at high risk for bc and other related cancers (ovarian) and others depending upon which brca is positive (colon, melanoma, pancreatic, etc.), because there are defects in the tumor suppressor genes affecting the body's ability to defend against tumor development. Other groups of high risk individuals include those with extensive family histories of bc, who haven't tested positive for BRCA genes, but likely have a genetic risk There are individuals with pre-cancerous conditions which raise risk, including Lobular Carcinoma in Situ (LCIS), as well as Atypical Ductal Hyperplasia (ADH) and Atypical Lobular Hyperplasia (ALH).  Ductal Carcinoma in Situ is considered by many to be cancer and by others to be pre-invasive cancer, so at very high risk, so it is treated aggressively as if early stage cancer. There are other pathological conditions that put individuals at risk.  I'm sure someone else can jump in with these. The most common category to get prophylactic mastectomies is, not surprisingly, those with BRCA positive genes.  If you read through the threads here, though, you will find individuals who have gotten prophylactic mastectomies for LCIS, ADH and ALH among other conditions.  Sometimes individuals have both the high risk condition and the family history, which concerns them greatly and they have the prophylactic procedures.  I'm sure one of our resident \"statisticians\" can help with the quantitative end of things, although I don't know exactly what you are looking for--what the risk is for each different category?  I have seen quotes that those with ADH have risks of 20 to 25 percent lifetime.  BRCA risks are much higher.  I wish this were an exact science.  It is not.  The Gail score does vary from others, and those are population risks, not your individual risk, which is not as easy to calculate.",

As I'm sure you have read by know, they \"grade\" the findings on imaging on a BI-RADS system, and they usually only biopsy areas that are rated either \"4\" or \"5\".  You can read further on this website about that rating system.  That means that there is greater than a 3 percent chance of being cancer.  For BI-RADS  4, only about 20 percent of biopsies are found to have cancer.  For BI-RADS 5, there is a much higher degree of certainty of cancer.  They are about 95 percent certain.  So, they usually don't biopsy areas where they don't see characteristics in the imaging which make it at least possible to be cancer.  About the \"internal\" scarring, well that is actually a big deal. If they biopsied every oddity that they saw on imaging, most women would be having biopsies after every mammo/sono.   Also, when they biopsy, if they don't have a diagnosis of any kind, they don't do \"wide margins\".  That is only when there is known cancer.  Try to take this one day at a time.  Best of luck, I know that the process can be terrifying.",

I While you are waiting, that might be a good thing to do.  I realize that they haven't identified all of the breast cancer related genes, so that having a very strong history is pretty compelling in itself.  Mastectomy is not usually done for ADH, but there are very high risk circumstances where it makes sense, and there are individuals who post on these threads who have done it for that reason.",

This is how Beesie explained multifocal DCIS, so I assume it has the same meaning.  When they say \"multicentric\" it would mean several different sites on the breast.  Multifocal is several different locations on the same duct.  As far as the finding of ALH on core biopsies and ADH on excisional biopsies, these kinds of things happen all the time.  I had ADH on core biopsy and DCIS (lots of it) on excisional biopsy.  The core biopsies are necessarily smaller areas, and the other areas of pathology, found in the excisional biopsy, can be adjacent to the area assessed on core biopsy.  They take a much larger amount of tissue during the excisional biopsy. What is your treatment plan at this point?",

This happened a number of years ago.  They were able to set up the wire localization for the one breast with the microcalcifications, and then proceeded, for several hours (!) to attempt to do repeat mammograms to find the area of suspicion in the other breast.  They weren't able to locate it, and like you, they attempted to find the area on a sonogram (ultrasound), with the hope of doing a biopsy that way (this was before they did ultrasound-guided core biopsies).  Again, they proceeded to poke at the breast for a long period of time, until the surgeon came looking for me.  My surgery was scheduled for the morning, and it was already afternoon.  So, they did the one excisional biopsy, but didn't do the other.  The breast ended up very bruised.  I was supposed to come back for a 6 month follow-up mammo, but I felt that I'd had so much radiation exposure from the several hours of mammo's, that I put off going back.  I also got a second opinion from a radiologist as to why they might have been having so much trouble.  He found the area of concern on the original mammo, and he thought that they were looking in the wrong area for the biopsy.  I have to say that calcifications (although I don't know if this was a calcification) can be very faint and very small.  They are not always easy to see.  Anyway, whatever that problem was, it seemed to no longer be seen on later mammo's.  I can certainly understand your anxiety over this, especially with such a compelling family history. I hope you get it resolved soon. I forgot to add that the radiologist doing the wire localization that day was truly awful.  She kept telling me that she was sure it was cancer, and I kept saying I was sure it wasn't.  Imagine adding that to the mix!  Anyway, the one breast that they did succeed with the biopsy had a benign finding, and I wish the same for you.",

It is interesting that ALH is considered as high risk (or even more) than ADH, and that both ADH and ALH put one at greater risk for IDC than ILC.  Also that most of the patients who were diagnosed on follow-up had intermediate to high grade cancer diagnoses.  I had ADH/ALH diagnosed at a relatively young age (43).  It was described as \"severe\" in terms of the pathological changes, and was re-read at MSKCC as the same diagnosis.  Nothing showed up in subsequent biopsies until 17 years later.  And with that, it was only DCIS, although multifocal, extensive and high grade.  There was also adjacent ADH, which was what was found on core biopsy (DCIS found on follow-up excisional biopsy and additional surgeries to get clean margins).  Anyway, since so many patients went on to IDC, including a number who were node positive, it is important to realize that ADH/ALH are high risk markers (especially if multifocal-and with higher grade pathology).",

MRI's are notorious for finding all sorts of things that lead to biopsies (most of which are benign).  I imagine that's why I'm not getting regular MRI's, although when originally diagnosed, I was given an MRI, and a nodule was found on the other breast.  The first hospital wanted to biopsy (BIRADS4) and the second said it's probably benign (BIRADS3), so I did end up ultimately with three MRI's but that's the end of it.  And P.S. I am holding off on hormonals, as well. When I had an ADH/ALH diagnosis 18 years ago, I did nothing special for follow-up other than annual mammos.  You are fortunate to be followed as a high-risk patient.",

Me: \"Cancer or DCIS\".  He:  \"DCIS is CANCER.\"  So, I assumed I would have a small amount of low grade DCIS and I would be a renegade and use the \"watch and wait approach, which is still considered not to be standard of care, even for low grade DCIS.  Well, I picked up my path report from the excisional biopsy, which indicated a large amount of mutlifocal high grade DCIS with necrosis, and there were no clear margins in any direction after 4 cm's were taken out.  At that point, without speaking with a physician yet, I exclaimed to myself \"bring on the rads.\"  I don't regret what I have done, because I may have just saved my life.  According to this article, I should have been told I had a breast lesion which would not likely harm me during my lifetime. Of course, I would have been relieved.  Who wants to contemplate invasive procedures like surgery and radiation.  Who really wants over-treatment?  But is it really over-treatment?",

You can also ask if they do the Canadian protocol for early stage bc, which is 16 sessions rather than 25 (or more). The dosage is increased and the number of treatment days is shortened.

It would be a fishing expedition. Of course, you should ask about it. They should have probably gone back in at that point three years ago, when they did the ductal excision and get a wider margin to examine the area around where the duct was removed, but even then, if they don't put a titanium marker in (or have marked margins on path slides)-it's still hard to find the area. Anyway, it's good that you are seeing an oncologist, so you can ask all of these questions (and questions about prevention). This all must be a bit scary and unexpected for you.",

If the pathology report finds it to be cancer, they might need to go back in and get wider margins. That procedure would be a lumpectomy re-excision (as the first was really a surgical biopsy). If... and only if, this small mass turns out to be cancer, and they remove it all in the biopsy with clean margins--then it would be your lumpectomy, and you would probably not need more surgery. Most of the time; however, untless there are contraindications, people generally do a core biopsy and if that shows cancer, then they go on to do a lumpectomy. So, if the first surgical procedure is to see if there is cancer, this is an excisional biopsy. All those questions about sentinel node biopsies and PET scans really come up a little later in the process. You have to have a diagnosis already.",

The ADH, itself, doesn't usually \"spread\" from what I've read.  It's just that it can progess to the next stage, which is DCIS.  That's what I had.  The ADH that I had most recently was adjacent to a large area of DCIS. I also had ADH diagnosed 18 years ago. I can also see that if you don't do the mastectomy, you will, for sure, continue with frequent imaging, potentially many biopsies, not to mention chronic anxiety. So, it sounds like a rational life choice.",

Suppose you did have the excisional biopsies (lumpectomies) and they did find DCIS, would you then just go ahead with BMX?  I had ADH/ALH found 18 years ago, and wasn't diagnosed with the DCIS until last year, so I went for a very long run without it (with a few biopsies in between).  Actually, they didn't even diagnose the recent DCIS in the stereotactic biopsy.  It was found in the lumpectomy.  I ended up having lots of DCIS, but really was leery of the major surgery and long term issues with mx and didn't want to do reconstruction, so I went with the lumpectomies (it took three to get clean margins). I have a family history of bc, and I tested negative for the BRCA genes.  So, I have tended to take the more conservative approach. I also have extremely dense breasts, even at 61. If you do the excisional biopsies, insist on doing it on both breasts. I'm sure you'll hear from others.",

With regard to the question of the pulmonary fibrosis, were these patients who had \"whole breast\" radiation or radiation to the chest wall (post mastectomy)?  Direct radiation to the chest wall would seem to me to have much higher risk to the lungs than the radiation to the breast.  When they radiate the breast, they don't aim it directly at the chest,  They aim it at the breast, in either a supine or prone position, depending on your circumstances, kind of in a horizontal position.  I had the supine position, and they propped up the breast with a mold to aim directly at the breast. I'm no radiologist, but if it's to the breast alone, the side effects may be more minor, if at all.  Also, is it the right breast or left breast you are doing?  Right breast radiation avoids the heart completely. You might want to do a radiation oncology consult even if you ultimately don't follow-through with that treatment, to get an idea of what might be involved from a technical standpoint.  I do realize that radiation oncologists sometimes downplay the risk factors, but I'm suggesting that you get an idea of the technical layout.",

A classification of 4a shows a somewhat lesser degree of suspicion and 4c has a greater degree of suspicion.  Good luck.  ",
