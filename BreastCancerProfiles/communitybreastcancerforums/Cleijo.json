I had breast reduction done in May and they found a 1.4cm tumor in the tissue removed.  Since then I chose to have a double bi-lat mastectomy with TE recon on 9 June surgery.  I feel better each day but still have one drain in which is the side they did the sentinel node bio from.  It is putting out about 40cc a day and still dark in color. Yesterday my chest above my old breast area started swelling.  It is not red or inflammed just a little tight and hard.  I went to the PS yesterday and he said I was still healing and did not seemed too concerned.  He thinks I may have pulled the muscle.  I did bend over Sunday and have a sharp pain in my chest when the TE is.  Also, he did say the drain is coming out this Friday which I am hope happens.  Have any of you had this happen?
