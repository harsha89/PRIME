Iv not been on it long... Having my 3rd infusion of 6 of my second cycle 6 (2 infusions a week then 1 week off). Had a pet scan before starting and a repeat pet after 1 cycle and disease was stable. Which is excellent and now being monitored by CT and have my first on friday and then every 6 weeks and can stay on trial as long as treatment works. Thanks for replying and taking interest in my post Lulu x",
