As for Progesterone; it is the great balancer of estrogen, and if you are indeed estrogen dominant as many are, you are probably not making enough on your own, so your estrogen is raging around your body unopposed feeding your cancer! May I suggest a natural bio-identical progesterone cream, It has helped me be human again. I think what you are referring to is that when your adrenals are compromised your immune system also is not fighting disease with the force it would under normal circumstances, making you more vulnerable for cancer cells to proliferate and grow. Interestingly, when the adrenals are not working it means the body's immune cells are attacking the body, and if they are attacking the body they are NOT fighting the cancer cells! I hope this makes sense to you. This article may also help: http://www.project-aware.org/Resource/articlearchi... As for Adrenal Exhaustion; I think this is sadly overlooked in breast cancer treatment. Just 6 days ago I learned I was dangerously low in ALL steroid hormones including Cortisol via saliva testing. A study I just read states that low cortisol levels are correlative to a poorer outcome than women with healthier adrenals:  www.adrenalfatigue.co.nz/adren...\u2026 Do your own due diligence research and NEVER accept when a doctor brushes off your concerns or discounts what you are experiencing, clearly adrenal health is important to any women who is fighting or is a breast cancer survivor!  My Best, ScubaGerl  IDC 1a ",
