I have never been married, bought my daughter up entirely on my own and stressed about buying my own home for years and probably caused my BC. However my insurance company paid me out, I have just bought my first ever home at 53 and also have super funds in Australia that may possibly pay me out  as well another NZ$100000. Makes my life so much easier and organised for my daughter as she will be set up should the worst happen. But truely I am so happy. So look at the positives. My Xeloda Yes I am triple negative now, thought I was ER+ and so far so good, but I am doing really well and without all that stress who knows - could live a whole lot longer. So look at it as a postive and worse case scenario getting  things all in order. I feel great but who knows. You have to not stress most important. I always look on the postive. My Onc gave me a couple of months to a couple of years. I can die happy knowing my daughter has a home but don't plan on going to soon. I almost feel like a fraud as feel so well at the moment but all could turn around quickly and my Onc has signed papers saying 1 - 2years now but when I got my insurance paid out less than a year - I was pretty ill then. My advice is to get it paid out asap as with all the shit going on in the world at the moment Insurance co. may end up not paying out at all or pro-rata. Just my thoughts. And you are not putting a time on your life unless you believe it - the mind,brain is a great thing. I tell my cancer where to go every night not politely, may work. - Good luck.",

BreastCancer.Org has been great for me and I have passed it on to a few on that web site and they love it too. It is just a shame that we are not able to participate in the great trials you have in the States. But you have some lovely people on it who give HOPE to us in little old NZ.",
