    "Content": "Feb 28, 2009 03:45AM - edited Feb 28, 2009 03:48AM by LanaHN I was 44. My Mum died from uterus cancer. I scare for my daugthes too. I had mastectomy, Chemo and going to have Herceptin for 1 year with Arimidex. I saw some were with BC for more than 10 years, even up to 20. But it seems in many people BC progress quickly from stage I to IV or V just after few years. I think this is good idea to have this kind of poll to know age, kind of BC, and treatments, progress... These information would be very helpfull. Good luck to all of us!",
