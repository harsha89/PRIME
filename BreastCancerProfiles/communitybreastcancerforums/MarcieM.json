I just had a mammogram and ultrasound done and the doctors are telling me that what I am feeling is post surgical changes in the scar tissue from the prior surgery but I just feel like something is not right. Your post is the first I have seen that even mentions scar tissue (I have been searching everywhere! lol) Do you think I should push for a biopsy of this \"scar tissue\" area? The doctors don't seem to concerned but I just have this feeling that something is not right. I am only 36 so I feel like they are not taking me seriously. Thank You!",
