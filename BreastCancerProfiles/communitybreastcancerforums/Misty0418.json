She examined me, felt the lump and then suggested to me that I have a biopsy done. I thought I was going to have to beg and plead, but it was nice to hear that I am not crazy for not wanting to just rely on the mamm. and u/s. I have an appt. with the surgeon on May 22nd. When do you have your biopsy done?",

I still have the lump and want to ask my doctor to please allow me to have a biopsy or MRI done, preferably the biopsy. I am really nervous that she will make light of my request due to my test results. Thank you all for your wonderful advice you have given me so far, you have made this experience a lot less worse than it could have been. Misty Log in to post a reply",

Today, the doctor's office called and said both were normal. I said \"that's great, but I still have this lump, does the ultrasound say anything about a cyst\"? She said the mammogram says that I have a \"benign calcification in the right breast\". Which is the breast that I feel the lump in. The report said also that if it continues to bother me that I should be sent for an MRI. I told her that I wanted to make an appt. to speak to my doctor about getting the MRI, because I don't like the fact that I have this lump and it is not proven to be a cyst. Am I being too paranoid, should I just let things rest with these normal findings or am I doing the right thing in asking for an MRI, just in case? Please give me your opinions I value them so much. Thank You all! Misty Lump in breast found 4/07 Mammogram and US 4/11 Log in to post a reply",
