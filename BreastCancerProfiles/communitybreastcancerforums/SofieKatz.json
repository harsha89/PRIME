The volunteers who use their  dogs as therapy dogs are generous, kind people. In NJ, our center coordinates visits to various facilities, included Carol Simon Cancer center in Morristown, visiting patients in treatment and their families as well.  I know many teams in NJ who would visit homes for people like us: emotionally in need of comfort. I know this all sounds silly, in light of your needs right now; but this is a simple, sweet, deep comfort that is overlooked.  There already be teams visiting a local out-patient facility near you.  You don't have to be in a hospital bed to benefit from this. I will be thinking about you.  We are both facing a frightening situation, mine looming just after yours.   ",

It's been exactly 4 weeks since my bilateral mastectomy and  lymphectomies.   Pain is gone; still tight in lymph arm, but working on that with stretching.  I went in 12 days ago to drain 800cc fluid from my surgical sites, and that put me back for sure.  But that is also healing nicely. But:  my stamina is so poor!  If I go out for lunch or just to visit with friends, by three hours I am exhausted and literally physically longing for my recliner.   How long does it take to be able to at least last three hours without crashing?  I have always been a physically and emotionally strong person, but I feel like I will never get strong again  Lucky I can work from home, because the idea of spending any time at my desk makes me very anxious, knowing how tired I get.

I am almost 6 weeks post-taxol, so basically my hair has been growing for 18 weeks and I am nowhere near going wigless.  I figure I will get a cut and color sometime in December.  Before that (probably in mid-October) I will have my friend (who is my stylist) trim off the soft ends to give it more body. The hair on my arms and legs are back.  Eyelashes 1/2 there.  Eyebrows not so much.     Let me add:  Chemo kicked my ass.  Taxol was much easier, but as the weeks bore on, I wore out.  (Also, the last 3 weeks of Taxol I ran a children's day camp of 48 kids.)  So basically having my hair begin to grow early was the only good thing that happened.    From what I read here, everyone is different in their treatment.   So that's just my experience.",
