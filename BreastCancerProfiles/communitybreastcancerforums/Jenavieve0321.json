The suregon told my family one was one of the biggest he had seen. I am 26 years old and have pretty much been crying for the past month after finding out my so called cysts (my gyno said that i have had since 18) were actually huge masses. Surgery went well, some pain today but other then that waiting for results seems to be much more painful. The suregon told my family he feels that they are fibrodonomas but nothing is 100% until results come back. I am trying to hold it together for my kids but finding that this is much harder then I thought it would be.Â  Log in to post a reply",
