TJW - I'm sorry you are having these side-effects from what is supposed to be a cake-walk compared to chemo.   That is depressing, but hang in there and stay strong....this too shall pass.  I'll be thinking of you. Happy rads everyone - Sherrie",

I just went back to work Monday, so it's been a long and tiring week.  I just finished 15 of 30 treatments yesterday.  Halfway through!!  I'm so looking forward to being done.  Skin seems to holding up well so far.  I've been using Fruit of the Earth 100% Aloe Gel.  The doc also gave me a couple of samples which i've been alternating with the Aloe.  They are Jean's Cream (very nice, but expensive), and Alra (this one is also very nice and much more reasonably priced).  Once I'm done with this, it will be on to the tamoxifen.  At least that's what the plan is right now.  My insurance company offers a cheek swab test to determine whether or not you metabolize tamoxifen effectively.  I will be doing that.  Traveler56, I'm so sorry about your friend.  My heart and prayers go out to you and her family.  Best - Sherrie ",

I'm thinking that I will try to schedule my treatments for in the morning before I go into work and just get it done.  Traveler56, I also drive about 30 miles to work (60 miles roundtrip) and the cancer center I go to is 5 minutes away from work.  I have been very emotional lately - this journey seems like it will never end.  You are all in my thoughts and prayers that we get through this leg of our treatment with as little discomfort as possible!!  Thanks for all of your suggestions! Otter - thanks for the tips on the LE therapist.  I started having some pain in my forearm and the  inside of my upper arm after treatment #2.  The APRN thought she felt some cording and suggested I do some good stretching after treatment #3 which I have been doing.  The stretching makes the pain subside and the upper arm pain is pretty much gone, but I still get some in the lower arm when it tightens up and I flex my wrist up.  I will see oncologist tomorrow before Tx #4 and will see what she has to say.    Sherrie (edited for some spelling errors)",

HensonChi - It sounds like you're feeling the way I did a couple of weeks ago when I had my last chemo.  I was glad that I was done, but was feeling down about having to start yet another leg of treatment.  I'm still anemic and my wbc's are below normal.  It seems at times that this is all never ending.....but chin up right - we just gotta do what we gotta do and get throught this nightmare! I still have off taste buds from the chemo and I'm probably too new to rads to have any side effects yet.  It's been almost two weeks since my last chemo and the metal taste has improved significantly.  I hope it continues cause it would be so nice to have normal taste buds again.

I thought I understood everything about breast cancer.  It really wasn't until my diagnosis this past May that I have learned so much; more than I ever wanted to know.  I think for most, to see and truly understand all the realties is too painful.  Then again, to say you are a supporter for bc research and a cure and not really understand all the facets of the disease and the depths to which it impacts people is sloppy, unfair and just plain inaccurate.  I think the pretty pink stuff started out as a way to bring more attention to the issue, which was great.  Now I would venture to say that the pink stuff has just really caught on and has become more of a marketing tactic to drive profits.  I really can't say, cause I haven't done my homework, but as a donor I want to know just how much of those sales are truly going to the cause.  At any rate, in our world today attention is good, so I'm at least glad that breast cancer stands out as an issue nowadays. One thing I do feel confident about saying is that YOU are truly amazing.  I have been reading all the support you offer to the women on this board and you are an invaluable resource to them.  Another thing is that if I ever have an opportunity to speak in a public forum on breastcancer awareness, I will not forget to tell the whole story.......you are right.  If we're going to talk about breast cancer, let's talk about all of it, not just the stuff that's less painful to swallow. God bless and stay strong! Sherrie ",

From my perspective, 3% doesn't seem that high unless you're on the wrong side of the statistic.  So to me, that was a big enough difference.  Somebody has to be in that 3% and I wanted to do everything I could to try and not be.  It's true, you can have chemo and still have a recurrence; but I knew I couldn't live with the \"what if\" if it happened to me.  I hope this helps.

      "Content": "Nov 8, 2011 05:01PM - edited Nov 8, 2011 05:01PM by Sherrie1964 This is an interesting topic.  I was diagnosed with a rare autoimmune skin disease just days after finishing breast cancer treatment.  I started having the skin symptoms just after the BC diagnosis. I was on several different medications for over a year and was not able to start my Tamoxifen for 6 months after treatment ended.  Things are pretty much back to \"normal\" now but it was a pretty exhausting couple of years; managing all the doctor appointments and medications, not to mention just plain having to educate every doctor I came into contact with on my disease.  I still have times when I feel very isolated as a result of my diagnoses.  Interestingly though, I'm much more eager to discuss my breast cancer with others rather than my autoimmune disease.  Sherrie ",
