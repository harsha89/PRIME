On the right side they had the replace the needle going in twice,  the second time going in I felt the pain. The right side has Micocalifications. The left side has a soild grey mass that did not collapse during sampling. A mammogram was taken of both sides after the biopsies and the mass was still present on the left side as well as the Micocalifications on the right.
