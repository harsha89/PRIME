We had an extensive discussion about breast cancer today including treatment options as per NCCN guidelines. We discussed the difference between lumpectomy, mastectomy, mastectomy with reconstruct ion as well as sentinel node biopsy with possible axillary dissection.  Risks and benefits were explained for al l of these procedures. We discussed different types of radiation including intraoperative radiation therapy.  At this time, the patient prefers a needle localized lumpectomy with intraoperative radiation.  Discuss genetic testing in great detail.  The patient testing is pending and she states the results would potentially impact her surgical decision.  I explained that the first course of action would be to schedule surgery or after she gets her genetic results.  I have given the patient reading information about all of these procedures and have answered all of her questions.  I have given her my contact information including email to call anytime or email with questions.  Total time spent with the patient exceeded 60 minutes with over half the time spent with counseling and coordination of care. ",

Hi Deanna, Great advice on Moffit.  We are to meet with them next Thursday.  I agree with the perineural invasion question.  My research and Shands comments see to discount as an important finding\u2026but we shall see. I agree with you regarding the ages of the surgeons.  Dr. Spiguel is 36 and Kiluk is 38. Here are details of yesterday\u2019s visit as well as an update related to hormone testing\u2026 A. Right Breast, core biopsy: - Invasive Ductal Carcinoma of Breast. See Note - Nottingham Histologic Score: 4 (Grade 1/III) (Tubule Formation: 1; Nuclear Pleomorphism: 2; Mitosis: 1) - Tumor Size: 10.5 mm in greatest linear dimension on one core. - Lymphovascular Involvement: Not Identified - Perineural Invasion: Present - Focal Ductal Carcinoma in-situ (DCIS) of breast (<1mm), cribiform type, low nuclear grade, without necrosis. - Rare microcalcifications are associated with invasive carcinoma. Note: Immunohistochemistry for SMMHC demonstrates loss of a SMMHC(+) myoepithelial cell layer in the invasive component, supporting the diagnosis. Additional studies for ER, PR, and Her2/Neu are pending, and will be reported as an addendum. UPDATE: ER: Pos PR: Pos HER2: Neg We were at Shands all day yesterday and met with Dr. Spiguel from Shands and found that she thought that it is a nice littel slow grower and that as long as no sentinel node involvement was observed during the lumpectomy, then the Intrabeam administration of high dose radiation on the site of the excised tumor, should be all that is necessary. She uses a 5cm orbit shaped device to zap with radiation during surgery. Of course, all of this is great news, so far. Rad performed a MRI with some contrast for the nodes to identify any other unforeseen hotspots. Waiting this morning for results...It seems that she is a conservationist and I am very hopeful that this will be our eventual course of action. Here is a link regarding her past experience.... On the way to the appointment, I called the Moffit Center in Tampa. Dr. Cox is no longer practicing (Doing mostly research) but I had read that Dr. Kiluk was a good one down there. Paintedlady and Tideknott both seem to like him and I had read other good reviews. The only thing that is a little bothersome is that he cannot see her until next Thursday. So another almost 10 days before he can take a look. I am having Shands send the slides, films and all results down to Moffit and asking them to fax a copy for our folder as well. (Per the \u201cjust diagnosed - get prepared\u201d post. (great stuff) Now we just have to wait on the MRI and to meet with Kiluk. Do you think 10 days more is a problem? I know she would like to get this thing out of her.  They seem to think that there is no rush and are fine with a second opinion. I mentioned the perineural invasion and the rad onc replied that they should not even put it on the path report.  (This is congruent with my reseach) BC does not travel via the nerves (unlike prostrate cancer) and it is no big deal.  However, it is rare.  I will be happy when moffit paths re-read the slide and when Dr. Kiluk reccommends the same course of treatment.  However, I am expecting a completely (competing) different treatment plan as it seems that this is common.  Anyway, thanks for all your help and I really appreciate it. Perhaps I should seek another dr. at Moffit who can see her earlier.",

She did well with the surgery, but is in a little pain now....(Surgery was last Thursday) DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the OR and placed in supine position on the OR table. After anesthesia was obtained, the patient was prepped and draped in the standard manner. Timeout was performed to ensure proper operation and patient. Then, 3 mL of isosulfan blue dye were injected in the subareolar position of the right breast. The breast was massaged for approximately 5 minutes of time. At this time, incision was made in the right axilla. Dissection was carried to the pectoral fascia until a total of 3 sentinel nodes were identified. Sentinel node No 1 was 0 blue and had a count of 5093. Sentinel No 2 was 0 blue and had a count of 63 cm. Sentinel node No 3 was 0 blue and had a count 274. The background count was 254, and this came back negative on touch prep analysis. Hemostasis was achieved with cautery. At this point in the operation, the incision was closed with interrupted 3-0 Monocryl suture, followed by a running 4-0 Monocryl sutures. The chest was then brought to the right breast. Incision was made in the lower outer aspect of the right breast. Dissection then proceeded with the use of Metzenbaum scissors around the breast tissue surrounding the septal wire. The breast specimen was labeled short superior, long lateral. Specimen radiograph was performed using the bioptic machine that demonstrated the clip, wire and mass to be within the excised specimen. The specimen was then sent to Pathology for gross evaluation, which demonstrated 2 close margins; there is a close inferior margin as well as a close anterior margin. With this information, new anterior and inferior margins were taken with clips marking the new margins. These additional margins were sent for permanent pathology. Hemostasis was achieved with cautery. The area was then inspected for potential use for intraoperative radiation therapy. A 3.5 cm radiation device was placed within the cavity. Unfortunately, when doing intraoperative ultrasound of the area, there was a close distance between the skin and the radiation probe which was under 5-mm. After consultation with Dr. Correa, the decision was made to not perform intraoperative radiation therapy. Clips were deployed for radiation planning. Incision was closed with interrupted. I hope all is well and that you all have a great week!",

Kiluk seems to be talented and involved.  I noticed the physician of the year designation, as well. I hope he is worth the wait and expect he will be.  We shall see.

More about Shaw (blog post related to her credentials) Any advice is much appreciated. She is to see Spiguel because Shaw is tied up for a week.  The scheduler said that Spiguel is very aggressive and not sure why it has taken so long.     Day 2 She is in the whirlwind phase now, but is very strong and accepting.  She is more worried about other girls in our family and wants to do the gene testing to ensure they are not at risk.  I have read that IDC is rarely genetically passed along.  My grandmother had cancer at 45 and died at 55.  Anyway, what she is steamed about is that she had the abnormal Mammo almost a month ago, and scheduling between Shands and the Women's cancer center in Orlando took so long and it was an agonizing almost 4 weeks and then it took nearly a week for her to call at 4:30 Wednesday afternoon to be told that she has cancer.  This happened yesterday afternoon.  She is not sleeping and is trying to decide what to do, but says she doesn't want it to consume her.   I got the line in for her new fax machine that resides in the kitchen.  Tried to get path report today, but since the test did not originate from the local internal med doc, they could not release it.  Anyway, tomorrow should yield results.  Great idea about seeing both, but they work together.  I wonder if they could be objective.  Was thinking about surgery in Gainesville and Oncology in Tallahassee.  Will be sure to bring copies of her film, ultrasound discs hopefully a MRI scan is coming first thing Monday, after the first meeting with the aforementioned Dr. Spiegel.  Thanks again for your words...I am very impressed with the knowledge of this group.  Who knows how many women it helps keep from suffering.  I am very sad that this has happened, but ready to help her fight.   UPDATE: Day 3 Just got the path report faxed over to me.  I like the stage NHS score of 4 on this, but have been reading about the PNI being present and there is an argument related to its importance in BC.  It would seem that nerve infiltration could be a big deal.  Anyway, please comment on the results as we are all still terrified.  I am doing most of the research at this point.
