Those pesky little hairs keep the mucus in the nasal passages (allowing it to be blown out ... sorry for being so graphic). Without the hairs, the excess mucus can slide down the throat, causing the lung problems you mentioned. I certainly had a phlemy cough all throughout chemo! Hugs, Hillary",

      "Content": "Apr 3, 2008 05:28PM - edited Apr 3, 2008 05:28PM by NarberthMom Not quite ... anemia doesn't prevent the flow of blood carrying the chemicals. Your blood contains red blood cells (which carry oxygen to all of your cells) and white blood cells (which fight infection). Anemia lowers the number of red blood cells that you have per volume of blood. If you are anemic, you are tired, because your cells don't have enough oxygen to make energy ... also, your brain needs a certain amount of oxygen. Red blood cells are produced all the time in your body, but they have limited life span and are eventually degraded. You get anemic during chemotherapy because the chemotherapy drugs slow down your bodies ability to make new red blood cells. The amount of red blood cells getting degraded remains the same, so over time, you have less red blood cells in your blood at any given time. Aranesp and procrit function by stimulating your body to make more red blood cells. It turns out that they also *can* stimulate the tumor into making more blood vessels, thus allowing the tumor to get more blood and nutrients. The more nutrients that the tumor has, the faster it can grow. Imagine that you had a tumor, and you were not on chemo ... if you were given an aranesp or procrit shot, then the tumor would have the ability to grow even faster. Things get more complicated when you have a tumor, chemo, and these shots ... I don't think that they know the pharmocokinetics of what's going on -- for example, does the increased blood vessels to the tumor help the chemo drugs get to the tumor and how does that compete with the nutrients also getting to the tumor? I hope that this is clearer.",

There is a wide range of normal hematocrit levels. Below a certain level, you are in serious danger of anemia. Prior to these drugs, one would have needed a blood transfusion. The problem with these drugs is that they also promote blood supply to tumors, helping to fuel their growth. I got panicked when I read these studies, as I had two aranesp shots. However, I was doing chemo after surgery, so there should not have been a large enough tumor left to benefit from improved blood flow. Also, my doctor adjusted the amount of drug given to me based on my hematocrit and the need to raise it only just a bit, to acceptable levels.",

I got my period one and a half years after chemopause (I'm triple neg).   My gyn had previously told me she wanted to know ASAP if I had any bleeding. I phoned on Monday, and was scheduled for an endometrial biopsy on Thursday. I'll know the results next week.  There are many plausible reasons why your period could come back, but some of the reasons are nasty. Get yourself checked.  As for me, I'm just hoping that I'm one of these rare 50 year old women who just have Energizer Bunny ovaries (takes a licking, but keeps on ticking!). I keep visualizing my ovaries with little smiley faces, smirking at me  and saying \"Gotcha ... now you have to go through menopause AGAIN!\" Hugs, Hillary ",

The American Cancer Society has a catalog website (www.tlcdirect.org/) with all kinds of products for hair loss.  Their wigs are very reasonably priced, averaging $45. They come with lots of hair, so bring it to your hairdresser to get trimmed to frame your face better. Many local offices of ACS have Look Good/Feel Better programs that will teach you how to care for your wig. Also, some of the local programs have a wig donation program .. you can go and try on different wigs and take home a brand new wig for free. Hugs, Hillary ",

My chemo center also always had another nurse come and check the IV site prior during the pre-meds before allowing the chemo drugs to piggy-backed on. The second nurse also double-checked the chemo bags to make sure that it was the right med for the right person.

When we told him about the side effects, he had two requests: (i) he didn't want to see me bald; and (ii) he didn't want his friends to know about my \"sickness\", as he called it. One thing I did was to tell all of his friends' parents and let them know that he didn't want his friends to know. I wonder if it would help your son if you talked to his friends' parents and asked them to talk to their kids. I also second the opinion that you should let his teachers and school counselors know (and camp counselors, if he's doing camp this summer). Although our situation never escalated to that, it was comforting for me to know that there were folks looking out for my ds. One final word ... I finished chemo almost 12 months ago (stopped wearing a wig almost 9 months ago). I made sure to always answer his questions as honestly as possible and we did a lot of cuddling when I was too sick to do much else.

Your hair will start to fall out about two to three weeks after your first chemo. You'll know it's starting to happen because your scalp will start to hurt. Most of us got our head shaved at that point ... easier to deal with short hairs coming out rather than longer ones! As Trina says, it's only hair and it will grow back. I was able to color my hair and look presentable about three months after my last chemo. It may seem like a lifetime away, but it's not. Also, be prepared for the fact that eventually you will likely lose all the hair on your body by the end of chemo. Probably worse than losing head hair is losing eyebrows and eyelashes. But, they do grow back quickly. Unless you have a job that depends on your looks, you are probably best off buying a synthetic wig. Wigs made from real human hair do look a bit more realistic, but they require a lot of work to maintain. You can get inexpensive synthetic wigs from the American Cancer Society's catalog (www.tlcdirect.org/). Don't bother buying their wig shampoo and conditioner. It's less expensive to use Woolite. Most local ACS offices also provide you with one free wig, as well as invaluable personal help with how best to wear a wig. They also sponsor Look Good, Feel Better programs. These three hour sessions offer tips on how to everything, but the best part is all the free makeup!! Definitely get your teeth cleaned before you start chemo ... you won't be able to do it while you're on chemo. Trina mentioned Biotene toothpaste and mouthwash ... it really worked for me! Some women still got mouth sores, but your onc can prescribe something called \"magic mouthwash\", which helped clear it up. You need to take good care of your skin, as it will get quite dry. Some folks really liked products from Lindi Skin, which are made specifically for chemo patients. I had luck with just my regular moisturizers. One rule of thumb that we found in terms of who had trouble coping with nausea during chemo: if you got bad morning sickness while pregnant, got carsick easily, or couldn't hold your liquor, you were more likely to suffer from chemo! OK ... I think that's enough for you all to digest. Again, as always, ask specific questions by pm and I'll try to answer them in a timely fashion. It's hard for me to believe that a whole year has past since I was in the same place as you ladies! Hugs, Hillary",

We were wonderful support for each other and we've stayed together as a group. I wanted to offer some advice from our combined chemo experience: (1) drink lots and lots of fluids ... water, flavored water, tea, fruit juice (2) take your meds ... don't wait until you start to feel sick (3) if your meds don't work, talk to your team about changing them ... you don't have to suffer (4) eat small meals to keep your energy up and to avoid nausea For those taking a taxane (taxol or taxotere), take care of your hands and feet. Moisturize. Wear supportive shoes if you're going to be on your feet a lot. I noticed that a lot of you have small children. My ds was five when I was diagnosed. He had two requests: he didn't want to see me bald (I always had to wear my wig or a cap around him) and he didn't want his friends to know that I was sick (in other words, always wear a wig around them). I did tell his friends' parents, as well as his teachers and pediatrician. My son quickly learned about the chemo cycle .. there'd be days when I was feeling poorly and days that I was better! The running joke was that he knew when I was feeling poorly because he could beat me at board games! Even if I was feeling poorly, I tried to spend some time each day just cuddling with him or reading him a book, if I was up to it. My dh and I counted on friends to help out if needed, and they were glad to do so. But, we tried to keep our son's life as normal as possible. I can tell you one year later that he did fine ... we had no major crises or behavioral issues. Please feel free to post on the Feb 2007 thread if you have general questions. You can also pm me for specific questions. Hugs, Hillary",
