I have read each of your posts several times, and have quietlly reflected on your words. I dont't have any answers. I hope for some repreive, or some stability, but I am no longer being treated so it would be naive to think so. I had an mri and ct scan on Friday to document progression. I tthink this will give me some information that I can share with my daughter. My daughter has been honest with me and said will not talk about it with anyone - she believes she will become a spectacle. At least now I can understand her resistance. i am trying to role model for her, even in this difficult time - I don't know if she will ever remember. I hope so",

I asked for no bigger than a B but I was left with a D. I would give anything to go back and just take it down to an A- . I do not enjoy the hassle of trying to constantly balance my chest, and would love to just slip in to a little padded sport bra and a tank top. I never once missed my breast, it was so weird - I just could not imagine do anything else invasive to my body. Caveat - just my experince, certainly not \"the right\" one, but was weird that it was one of the few times in my life Ihad no conflict with a big decision.",
