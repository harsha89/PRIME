All lesions were benign, but the biopsy found LCIS, which is not cancer but a high-risk marker. My family history is ridiculous, like yours, so I did a prophylactic bilateral mx. The moral of my particular story is that the bloody discharge started me on a pathway that ultimately enabled me to plummet my risk of getting the family disease. Not saying that prophy mx is the answer for others with similar findings, but you may find that your biopsy takes you in unexpected directions.  Good luck tomorrow!",

The ideal supplier will have a good return policy, because my friend would like to order several garments from suppliers she does not have access to at home, try them on, and then return what does not work well. We have such great service in the States from Brightlife and other vendors, that I'm hoping there is a similar resource (or two) in Canada. Brightlife will ship to Canada, but from reading their website, it seems the shipping and customs costs can be high. Another friend explained to me that garments can get some kind of certification of medical need that waives customs fees, so perhaps that's an avenue for the friend in need. So...Canadian swell sisters, where do you buy your garments? Thanks for any ideas! Log in to post a reply",

My LE is in that arm, so I've had to remind myself all the time to transfer the heavy load to my right hand and let the LE hand do some of the finer work.  All of which to say--I wonder if in your case, you are already letting your non-LE limb do the heavy lifting, which is a good policy and can only help you here.  I will admit to getting frustrated when I try to type wearing my compression gauntlet, but then I just remind myself that it's slowing me down, and that means (glass half full) that I'm taking more time to think about what I write instead of just dumping thoughts!  You will find ways to look at the glass half full, I promise.  And a good measure of that comes from all the amazing support you'll find in the LE forum here.  Having LE PO's every single one of us...so we're a good group to dump frustration on, because we've all been there in some degree or another.

At the moment I'm suffering from a rotator cuff problem with my non-LE arm, so both arms bark at me! Fortunately, there is another solution. We own a two-person Hobie kayak with what they call Mirage drives...you use your feet to propel the kayak. I prefer paddling the old fashioned way in my single person, sit-inside kayak with a rudder, which except in high headwinds or against current is pretty easy to move. DH prefers the Hobie, and we put our dog in the front seat (he gets a free ride, the free loader). The foot work is not like riding a bike, as the feet do not go in a circle. Rather, it's more like a pushing action, alternating feet. Underneath, there are flippers that mimic a seal's breast stroke action. Totally fun, and I do often use it when we go out on the river without the dog. It's probably more efficient to use big quadriceps muscles instead of little triceps and lat dorsii muscles, too. I like the back seat. DH cannot tell when I'm slacking. The Hobie is quite heavy and I find it's less maneuverable than a traditional kakak, but that's probably just because it's longer than my one-person kayak. The Hobie uses a rudder that you control with your thumb. And Hobie is so sure you don't need the paddle (but there's one mounted on the side just in case)--they give you cup holders. You do need the paddle in extremely shallow water, when there's no room for the underside flippers. That's pretty rare, in our experience, but it does happen; or when we go through weeds in shallow-ish water. So, if I ever have to give up on using my arms to paddle, I have a good alternative, although I'm not sure where we'd put the dog when we camp from the kayaks, if I took one of the Hobie seats! We go for up to a week at a time camping from kayaks in various rivers in Michigan, and it's gorgeous. We live on the Kalamazoo River, so that paddling is at our door step. Eagles nest near us, although the nests are not in sight from any river stretch we've been on, but they are in the neighborhood all the time. In winter we have 3- 5 eagle sightings a day, usually in groups of 2-3. They're attracted to the moving river water, when inland lakes are frozen and fishing is limited. It's common to see them in our back yard trees, close enough to see the pupils of their eyes. They are magnificent birds. All of the above, and your experience too: the best reasons not to let LE take over. And I should mention that I've been lifting weights in the gym for years, and I get help and supervision from a personal trainer who was kind enough to attend a PAL workshop (learned about the PAL Protocol, i.e. guidelines and precautions for strength training when we have or are at risk of LE). So my arm is well conditioned for the repetitive motion and the resistance of paddling. That's no guarantee I'll avoid trouble, but I think it helps.",

As Binney said, your night garment is probably the better option now, even during the day, because normal post-surgical swelling could be making your arm / hand temporarily swollen, and LE may have nothing to do with it. Lots of us were told zilch about LE or had the risks downplayed big time, so it's heartening to hear that your surgeon is helping you do what you can to reduce the LE risk. Sure hope you don't get it! My mother had every single node removed too, and then a crazy amount of rads to the axilla. That was more than 40 years ago and she has never developed LE, so there's some hopeful inspiration that it will leave you alone, too!",

They're not personal trainers, but still, they all seemed like they would be very valuable strength training supervision resources if a qualified personal trainer is not available.  Only the sad part is that they cannot charge for / be reimbursed for supervising an exercise program. These therapists jumped at the chance to participate in a PAL-based workshop, because they were interested in learning the protocol first hand, and because they find that continuing ed opportunities for LE therapists are a bit hard to come by without extensive travel.  So we had a very interested and willing group of therapists, but they are so limited in what they can actually do as far as ongoing follow-up with patients. Katie Schmitz wrote in the most recent NLN newsletter that UPenn is going to launch a PAL-based 4-week group exercise program that will require up-front certification by a LE therapist that participants are healthy enough to take part.  That's terrific, but she also notes the challenge of getting enough trainers qualified to use the protocol, and the difficulty of getting LE therapists paid to lead the sessions.  But I take great heart in the very idea that someone is working on expanding accessibility of safe strength training.  The vision of bringing better exercise coaching to 2.6 million BC survivors is a wonderful goal as we enter 2012.  My bet is that it's a long process. I love that you have a trainer in whom you can have confidence that modified lifts and using the bands can advance you safely thorugh your strength program!  I'm waiting for a sleeve and gauntlet to come in, for flying and for weight lifting, and expect to start lifting in a few weeks. (And I had my bike modified this week to put me upright over the handle bars...but that's a follow-up for a different exercise thread we were chatting in!) Tina, I'm LIFTING a flute of champagne to you and your fitness goals tonight!  Happy New Year! Carol",

Michigan is called PALS for Life, and you can find info about it at www.cancersurvivorfitness.com.  This program is a one-day workshop for certified personal trainers and lympehedema therapists. The trainers need to have one of the personal training certifications so that it is clear they understand exercise physiology and can be very effective in supervising weight training form, but they do not need to also be physical therapists.  The woman who owns PALS for Life was the lead personal trainer in the PAL Trial, so she supervised all of the trainers who were working with the trial subjects at the Ys spread around Philadelphia. She uses --with permission-- the PAL Protocol as the basis of her workshop, and at the end of the day, the trainers have all that they need, including progress monitoring logs, visuals of the exercises, etc. to work with breast cancer survivors for a 12-week, 2.x week program. As you noted the PAL Protocol includes both in-gym and at-home exercise sequences, and the trainers attending this workshop walk away with both.  UPenn will send the PAL Protocol document to certified personal trainers who ask for it, so a very knowledgeable trainer who takes the program seriously can work with a BC survivor on strength training that conforms to the protocol.  What I liked about the workshop is that it was chock full of the 'why'-- why certain exercises are included and others excluded; why a particular form element for an exercise needs to be especially exact;  background on LE and its causes and risks, and the what and why of compression and MLD. As one who teaches adults via financial seminars, I know for sure that most learners get more out of information and develop stronger skills when they learn by doing and when the 'why' is delivered in tandem with the what and the how.  The PALS for Life workshop includes both classroom and in-gym demonstrations and practice, so the participants got all three: why, what, how.  We had some very experienced personal trainers in our workshop, including a woman with a masters in exercise physiology.  Every one of them said afterward that beforehand, they had no idea about LE and its risks, and that what they learned really opened their eyes on the need for following the PAL Protocol with BC survivors. Cathy Bryan--owner of PALS for Life--explained that given the billing/insurance reimbursement problems for LE therapists to supervise their patients' exercise, the best outcome is to have some PAL-trained certified personal trainers who have collegial relationships with LE therapists. Two of our participating LE therapists are in hospital settings where there are affiliated fitness facilities, and one of the participating personal trainers came from one of these fitness clubs. The idea is that the CLT does baseline arm measures and gives an LE patient a green light to begin a PAL-compliant training program, and the patient checks in periodically with the therapist to report progress. Of course, if there is a flareup that the patient cannot manage through normal MLD and garment/wrapping means, there would be a consultation with the therapist, and the personal trainer and therapist should have a phone conversation to agree on a resting interval, backing off of weights, etc. For this to work, obviously the CLT needs to know what's going on in the gym and know exactly what the PAL Protocol guidelines are.   That's why Cathy asked me to recruit CLTs for the workshop as well as personal trainers, so that we could begin to build a community of CLT/personal trainer colleagues to work together like this. So...if we are lucky enough to have a way to get our personal trainers trained in PAL --which Tina, you have by virtue of living where the trial took place, and I was able to do with just a little effort to bring PALS for Life here for a day--then there should be minimal need to use up insurance-covered therapy visits for strength training supervision.  As Kira said, getting the PAL training out to a meaningful number of personal trainers around the country is a daunting task. My CLT and another who attended our workshop are combing through patient files and will call women in the next month or so to see who might be interested in attending a free 12-week PAL session at my gym, which I think we'll schedule for the spring. The CLT/personal trainer who work together in a hospital sytem are working on scheduling a 12-week session in their town, about an hour from me. Meanwhile, this morning I had my first training session with my own trainer--only I won't have my sleeve and gauntlet for another few weeks, so we kept it to lower body, core, balance and flexibility. This was my first formal strength workout since my July surgery, and it felt great! And, both Todd (trainer) and I were struck by the number of adjustments we needed to make to our formerly take-for-granted exercise elements, such as no planks for core work, to avoid bodyweight on the arm. Sorry about the length I've written here, and I know it sounds like I'm promoting PALS for Life, but honestly, it's a great way to get some trainers trained.  Tina, maybe you can organize a group session to be led by your at-home PAL trainer.  If she/he trains at a gym, perhaps something could be worked out to gather a good group of BC survivors.  I'll bet your therapist could identify several women who would like to have such supervised strength training but whose insurance issues are like yours and your friend's.  Group training rates are often quite reasonable, and it's even possible that for such a special program, the hosting gym might not need to have everyone purchase a gym membership. This morning we have ten inches of snow on the ground here and more to come, all day and night. The driveway gets plowed, but now I have to think hard about how to modify my shoveling technique for the walkway from drive to house, to protect my affected arm!  (DH works 3 hours away M-Th, so it's me vs. walkway...)

The PAL protocol has us both adding (and backing off, after LE symptoms or after missing workouts) measured weights.  The problem is in the measurement.  After successful, slowly progressive weightlifting using measured weights, without LE incident over a good window of time, the PAL trainer would indeed introduce push ups and other bodyweight resistance exercises to a BC survivor's program--but not at first.  Bodyweight resistance is such a common part of at-home strength programs, it just seems to me that there should at least be an explanation of its limitations in a slowly progressive-weight program.

I faxed it to his office, and that very evening he called me to apologize for discounting the LE explanation, and he wrote the referral the next morning.  I think sometimes we're trapped into unsatisfactory conversations with out physicians and surgeons because time in the exam room is so limited. There are so many other topics to cover, many of them emotionally charged given the underlying foundation of BC as the continuing thread for our visits. I took my time composing my letter, and I do believe that my surgeon responded well to it in part because we were not face to face, so he had time to reflect instead of giving an immediate response.",

Be sure to explore the rest of the stepup site, because you'll find an unbelievable wealth of excellent information on all things regarding lymphedema.  To find out if your symptoms are from LE, it's important to get a professional evaluation from someone who specializes in lymphedema evaluation and treatment.  Here's how to find a qualified person (and any of your care team can make a referral: http://stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Ly...

If you want a short-sleeve shirt, we generally find that the men's versions work better, because the women's short-sleeve shirts have cap sleeves that tend to cut into the axilla.  The general guideline is to get a size smaller than you usually would wear (even smaller if using a men's size), and wear it inside out so the seams don't bug your sensitive areas. Swelling from not sitting right...that's a new one and a pretty poor response to your symptoms. Good luck, and do post more questions here.  Lots of us have truncal LE!",

Some women here have had trouble with tissue expanders causing some swelling, and when they got their exchanges things improved.  Studies (there's one for every topic) suggest that getting immediate recon like you did lowers your LE risk, and I saw one study that suggested implants are associated with better LE risk reduction than the flap surgeries. Maybe you've got something going on with the TEs and the PT can help you figure that out.  But I'd say to keep LE in mind and don't be shy about pushing back to ask for a formal evaluation from a qualified LE therapist.",

Moira, it is standard protocol in the US for therapists whose patients need wrapping, to teach them to wrap so the patient can transition to self-care. Many therapists teach all LE patients to wrap, so they'll know how to do so in the event of a flare up; sometimes it is very difficult to schedule with a therapist because we really don't have enough of them, so it's critical that patients know how to wrap so they can start to control the swelling as they wait for appointments.  I'm so sorry you don't have the care you need. Musical, checkout brightlife.com and you'll see the range of off-the-shelf sleeves and gauntlets, so you can compare prices.  In this world of online purchasing, it sure seems like --if off the shelf is something that works for you-- you could buy from afar.

They are special in that they apply high pressure when you're active and muscles are moving, but when you're at rest, the pressure subsides. An Ace bandage is often confused for LE bandages, because it looks about the same, but the Ace elastic bandage gives high pressure constantly.  Lymph moves when muscles surrounding the lymphatic vessels push against them, and the bandage gives a firm surface against which the muscles can push, and that's what helps move our lymph along. So it makes sense that if your arm is still--say, your in a cozy chair reading--you want the bandage to relax, i.e. not constrict the lymph vessel when the nearby muscle pump is not at work. There's a company here that's somewhat new to manufacturing LE bandage supplies, although they have been making many types of bandages, including elastic versions, for many years.  It's called AmbraLeroy. Their products are apparently much less expensive than other suppliers, and you can see the products and prices here: http://www.ambraleroyonline.com/catalog/c28_p1.html I know that they are working to expand product distribution for the LE line. They also sell direct through the online store. If the price is much less than what you have to pay in NZ, I wonder if they would be willing to ship to you, which is not horridly expensive if using a USPS flat-rate ship box.  I have a contact there and if either Musical or Moira (or anyone else) is interested in investigating, PM me and I'll give you his name and email address.",

So, if we build our strength -gradually, slowly, carefully- lifting something heavy will not be 'unaccustomed' and the lymphatic system will not respond to perceived stress with a build up of lymphatic fluid being sent to the rescue. The trick is to not trigger LE while doing the weight lifting! Several studies have confirmed that weight lifting per se does not increase LE risk, but only if you do it following very careful and cautious guidelines for slow, gradual addition of weight.  It's not a cure or a treatment for existing LE, although many women find that when they're stronger, they're less likely to have LE flare ups after physical exertion.   One more thought is that muscle movements against the lymphatic vessels moves lymph along in the body, so to the extent you're using muscles, you're enhancing the lymphatic activity. Here are two documents to look at and to show your doctors, etc. They're similar-one is for personal trainers and exercise instructors, and the other is for women who have or are at risk of LE and want to learn about exercise precautions. http://stepup-speakout.org/Trainer%20doc%20for%20SUSO-040113.pdf http://stepup-speakout.org/Handout%20doc%20for%20SUSO-040113.pdf The landmark PAL Trial (Physical Activity and Lymphedema is what PAL stands for) had women start with one-pound weights, nothing heavier, so I find that a recommendation to start with 2-3 pounds is aggressive.  Think too, that when you put a weight in your hand, there's a lot more resistance against your torso if you extend the hand out compared to holding it into your torso, another reason that starting with very small weights is a good approach.",

Do this five times, three or four times a day, or as often as you think of it (it moves lymph fluid).  Also put your arm up as straight in the air as you can, and pump your fist twenty times, slowly...do as often as you can think of it (also moves lymph fluid). So sorry you have to even wonder if it could be LE, and hopefully it's not, and it's something simple. But best to find out, because early treatment is helpful in your goal to reduce symptoms. Keep us posted on what you learn. And -- sending you some virtual brownies to make the annoying tingle go away (don't we wish it were that simple, sigh...) Carol ",

That got my attention, because I developed LE after sentinel node biopsy and would like to pass along some information that's relevant to your conversation. Stretching exercises within a week or ten days of axillary node dissection have been shown to nearly triple LE risk, but waiting that week or those ten days seems to not make any difference in getting range of motion back.  I'll drop in a copy of a discussion of the study here, and if anyone wants to have more particulars of the study, just PM me.   Of course I should acknowledge that the study was of women who had a fair number of nodes removed, so it does not specifically address stretching after lx or after sentinel node biopsy, but still...if there's no threat to range of motion by waiting a week or so to start the wall walking, etc., then why not be extra cautious even if no nodes were purposefully touched? (We generally have one or more in the breast itself, so even a lx can remove a node or so.) Here's the summary of the study findings, taken from a course I wrote for nurses who wish to learn about breast cancer-related lymphedema: The effect of post-surgical exercise and therapy on BCRL risk-- Immediate post-surgical range-of-motion exercises are shown to increase BCRL risk Surgeons commonly prescribe shoulder and arm exercises to restore upper limb and shoulder function after mastectomy, radiation therapy, and/or axillary node dissection. Many studies demonstrate the effectiveness of immediate exercise intervention (McNeely 2010) to avoid painful conditions such as the common adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder (\u2018frozen shoulder\u2019) after mastectomy. However, immediate shoulder mobilization has also been shown to increase the incidence of BCRL among women with early breast cancer whose surgery included axillary node dissection. Todd (2008) conducted a two-group (delayed vs. early full range shoulder mobilization), single-blind, randomized controlled trial with 116 women. Both groups engaged in immediate post-operative exercise, with one group using a full range of motion, and the other group restricting arm movements to below 90° in all planes of movement for the first week, followed by introduction of full range-of-motion in the second week. Each group continued the prescribed exercise program until full shoulder motion was restored and then once a day for the first post-operative year. These researchers found that women in the early full-shoulder mobilization group had 2.7 times the incidence of lymphedema, and that limb volume differences (affected compared to unaffected arm) were significantly higher compared to the delayed-exercise group. There were no statistically significant differences in shoulder movement, grip strength, or self-evaluated outcomes between the groups at one year post-surgery (Todd 2008).  An earlier study found in a systematic review of random controlled trials of early vs. delayed arm exercises that delaying exercises significantly decreases seroma formation (Shamley 2005) (which researcher Dr. Mei Fu found to be an important risk factor for BCRL). Post-surgical physical therapy shown to reduce BCRL risk Torres Lacomba (2010) tested early postsurgical intervention using physical therapy that included manual lymph drainage, massage of scar tissue, and shoulder exercises, beginning the therapy not earlier than three to five days after hospital discharge, and continuing three times per week for three weeks. At one year post surgery, 7% of women in the intervention group had developed lymphedema, compared to 25% of women in the control (education only) group. The Torres study report is not clear on whether any participants began the therapy within the seven-day post-surgical period Todd et al found to be risky for future BCRL development, stating that study subjects were assigned three to five days after discharge to either an education-only group or an education-plus-intervention therapy group. There is no comment about when exercise actually started for the intervention group, but it seems likely that exercise was delayed at least five days, and probably closer to seven for many patients Key Points",

The mixing method is quite different from traditional wheat bread, and I agree with you that it's hard on the arm. I can do a beautiful wheat bread start to finish with hand kneading and not disturb my LE arm, but with GF, there's a bodacious amount of mixing that is designed to incorporate lots of air, and that's more hard work than my poor LE arm can do. So you are spot on with the mixer idea. I too use a Kitchen Aid, the one I've had for 25 years and has not let me down. I'm actually considering asking Santa to upgrade my Kitchen Aid this year, to one that's larger and has more horsepower, for when I do several kinds of breads that I don't do by hand, and that I bake in large volume. So I've been reading reviews lately, and there's a certain sentiment that ever since Whirlpool purchased Kitchen Aid some years ago, there have been parts substitutes --plastic instead of metal--and the machines don't last as they traditionally have. So I do endorse Kitchen Aid from my own experience, but read reviews carefully. And happy baking! Carol",

One disappointment I have with my oven is that the fan takes up so much space in the back, more than an inch. I have some lovely huge cookie pans I used in my last house's oven that will technically fit in my convection oven, but the pans nearly touch the front and back of the oven, so even with the fan I don't believe the air circulates properly.

And DH has world-class metabolism! Binney, it's not hard to do at all. The hard part was cutting the stencils. I moistened the dough so the plastic would stick a little and then used a popsicle stick to help keep the edges down as I tapped a mini sieve above. Then, peeled the stencil away very carefully (I put little tabs on them to help with that). Unfortunately, neither the flour nor the cocoa powder sticks well to the bread after it leaves the oven, and from some reading I understand that's always the case. So it's lovely to do this for presentation (or a photo!) but the effect doesn't last long if the loaf is wrapped or as it's being cut. Next weekend I'm going to see what happens if I mix flour with an egg wash and paint the resulting paste onto the stencil, and then sprinkle flour on top. I scoured the bread-making cyber universe for a solution like that, but nobody's talking about it. In March I'm going to return to bread school, for a 4-day whole-grain class followed by a 2-day practicum for just shaping, slashing, and decorative touches like stenciling, so if I don't figure it out by then, I'll have a great resource to consult. I love everything about making bread--the feel of the dough coming to life, the art of shaping and slashing the loaf, the smell, the taste. I've been experimenting from time to time with gluten free versions for some cherished family and friends, but so far it's not been the same experience at all. But I have not given up! I can immerse myself in a bread project and just forget about LE. Now that's the real gift of a pastime we're passionate about!",

Her language choice reveals a bias that should disqualify this article from consideration as a serious interpretation of a body of studies that we recognize are incomplete and draw inconsistent conclusions. I thought the article was reasonably factual and objective until the Risk Reduction Strategies part, although I know very little about radiation tangents and so I need some help understanding your concerns about that part of the narrative. The broad-stroke labeling of risk reduction practices as lymphedema 'myth' is so very harmful, as you point out, because it encourages denial of symptom and proactive care by physicians who prefer not to acknowledge our reality. As one who got LE after prophy mx and SNB ('only' 5 nodes), and without any additive risk from radiation therapy or chemotherapy), I just do not see an appropriate risk/reward balance in this writer's argument.  True, some of the risk-reduction practices may be founded more in clinical anecdotal experience than from large-population, randomized control studies with long-term follow-up. However, has the author shown there is demonstrated risk to adopting the precautions she indicts? The only precaution-driven risk she cites that remains an open question in my mind is the air-travel precaution, where we know the evidence is mixed, and where the precaution for women at-risk is couched in the use-your-individual-judgment caveat. Avoiding exercise is seemingly not an endorsed precaution any more, and indeed, one can interpret NLN's and  others' recommendation to engage in exercise as an appropriate proactive precautionary measure. I will never understand why there is any controversy over using an at-risk arm, when an unaffected arm is available for IVs and BPs. That's an easy choice, whether you think it's highly protective or just an abundance of caution. For bilateral risk, I understand that using a foot for IVs can confer some added risk of infection compared to a standard arm IV, but then...isn't the lymphatic system more equipped to handle an infection in the leg, than an (arguably less likely) infection in an affected arm? Kira, have any of the champions of LE research and care (Armer, Stout Gergich, Cheville) rebutted this doctor's interpretation of LE risk-reduction 'myths'? Sigh..... Carol",

Her radiation therapy is the primary suspect for cataracts that were fully developed by age 43, necessitating surgery and seemingly setting her up for the surgery sequela of a detached retina--and more surgery. I take great comfort in radiation advances that allow the field to be chosen purposefully today. In my mom/mom-in-law's BC generation, that was not really the case and their experiences bear witness to the consequences.  Mom is and M-i-L was a 40-year+ survivor, before the advent of chemo and any understanding of hormones and cancer, so radiation must have been key to their survival.  What a double-edged sword, but your posts here make me optimistic for more effective rads, with less collateral damage now and in the future.",

Kira and Binney put so much time into reaching out to all of us that well, it's astonishing there's time for the mundane daily life tasks-just brushing and flossing for goodness sake--without imagining there might be time left over for a little cardio romp. As for me, honestly it's easy to stay pretty positive and motivated, because a) I haven't had to deal with LE very long; b) my LE is mild--annoying, but no wrapping required; and c) I got to 'skip' the BC part of this journey, taking the easy route of prophy bmx.  In the realm of how life tries to beat us down, my experience has been a walk in the park compared to virtually every other woman who joins us in the LE forum.  Even LE hasn't had long enough to wear down my batteries. (Yet) So, wrapping and MLD, yes, push yourselves, and of course, try to work on more exercise. But...I hope that when discouraged, you're not too hard on yourselves.

Like Becky, I am doing about an hour of cardio six days a week, and three days a week I am in the gym lifting weights. I do MLD after weightlifting once home, plus on waking and before bed every day. Somehow the thought of turning over yet more of my day to LE--well, just cannot go there, so no Lebed. I did do it last night in a hotel room after getting an achey arm from flying, and sometimes while traveling for work when I don't have access to a fitness facility. I am in awe of all of you who must also find time for wrapping in addition to MLD and exercises. Nitocris posted some lymph exercises a while back (drawings we can follow). Maybe someone can find that post and put the link here, as an alternative to Lebed. I have seen people do tai chi in the airport, standing in some corner and seemingly oblivious to onlookers. Not sure I would do that, but maybe, if my arm continues to tingle from flying. (Don't anyone hold your breath on that one!) Carol",

Most of us have asymmetrical breasts anyway, and then when you have lumpectomy the anatomy changes and well...measurements just don't work.  So the therapist looks for other indicators.   These include checking the texture of your skin and feeling for any puffiness just below. Also, he or she will ask you questions to see if you're noticing any other sensations that would suggest lymphedema.  For example, we often feel an achiness, or a slight burning sensation, or tenderness, and especially when the area is rubbed.  Trying on clothing can leave the area feeling pretty raw.  Itching can be part of it, too.  Also, do you have deeper bra marks on that side, compared to on the other side, and is that new (compared to before your surgery)? Compression and manual lymphatic drainage are the standard treatment to help move the lymphatic fluid, called 'lymph' out of the area where it's pooling. Compression is obvious when we think of an arm--wear a medical compression sleeve plus a glove or gauntlet on the hand--but on the breast, it's harder to achieve.  There are compression bras that some women wear, which sounds worse than I understand it really is.  Or, simpler, sometimes it's a question of inserting a special chip-foam insert in your bra to gently apply pressure where it's needed.  Those are called aptly 'swell spots.'  The therapist you'll be meeting with should give you information about that. I sure hope you get some answers pronto!  If you haven't discovered it already, here's a website loaded to the gills with information by LE patients for LE patients, on all matters both medical and practical for dealing with the condition: www.stepup-speakout.org.  The best time to catch lymphedema is when it's hard to catch because it's in early stage development. That's when it's most treatable.  So good for you for being so proactive in calling your radiologist for follow-up. Everyone in this forum believes that our therapy should always include chocolate.  So take that particular step now! Hugs to you-- Carol",

Remy is the most affectionate dog I've ever owned, and he has an uncanny ability to sense moods and emotional needs, more than any dog I ever owned before--which were all shelter dogs, and wonderful, wonderful pets.  One thought on the poodle cross breeds is to make sure that you understand how many generations back the poodle cross goes; I was told that a golden crossed with a poodle gives a one-in-twelve chance of not getting the poodle hair, but you cannot tell from the puppy hair, only when the adult coat comes in.  I have no clue if that is true, but it's a signal to me to do some inquiring and research, if no-shed is important to you. We just returned from taking Remy on a one-hour snow hike, using the poles and the yak-trax, on a very hilly, uneven trail. Three miles on the nose for distance, but lots more energy used than for my normal fitness walking.  Remy, I believe, logged 9 miles, because we let him run and with his four-paw-drive, he doubled and tripled us constantly.  Wish I had his energy!",

DOMS is an inflammatory response to muscle overwork, and that means it's a terrible outcome for those of us with LE.  So, my trainer nags me to hop on the treadmill after lifting weights (or to jog or do Sansone at home after lifting dumbbells in the house), and he also believes that a light snack with both protein and carbs helps to prevent DOMS.  And, some good stretching and lots of water to drink. Gosh, there sure are a lot of 'must do' items on the punch list when exercising with LE!  Anyway, I'm up to 6.9 miles for my day and feeling totally relaxed after the gym time!  I do hereby commit to MLD before ending my day.",

So frustrating, isn't it?  We want to exercise (or just do life's daily activities) and to be able to figure out how to protect our LE areas, but my gosh, it's such a moving target. And just to make it more difficult to predict when we might flare and thus how to avoid it, the weather seems to play a huge role. I'm aching today and the only explanation I can come up with is that the weather is funky and maybe barometric pressure is punishing me. Yesterday I did a 6 mile forest hike with DH and friends, through some snow, but not enough to make snowshoes useful.  We were in a beautiful park in Ohio, following a very up-and-down hilly bridle trail that also had us hopping stones across a creek, crossing the same creek by walking on logs like balance beams, taking leaps across the creek...basically we were crazy to do it, but it was outrageous fun. (The creek was shallow..I'm not THAT crazy!)  And my recently-acquired waterproof hiking boots (that I now use with the snowshoes) proved to be absolutely waterproof, so sometimes I walked right through that very meadering creek to avoid stepping in ice-covered stones, and it was really, really a hoot.  We all felt like kids.",

I also had a chance to chat with a nutritionist about how to make sure that my investment in fruit and veggies really does get me the nutrition that's in the food. So now I'm using a lot of frozen fruits and veggies, still eating fresh foods that either cannot be frozen (like salad greens) or that are realistically grown nearby, even if in a hothouse, or that travel and store well. So fresh produce now is mostly root vegetables, plus citrus which keeps its nutrients well.  When I eat other fresh produce, like say, grapes, I enjoy it but don't count on it to have its miracle properties--so I'm eating lots of frozen products to get what I need.  And...no knife required! I had a houseguest all weekend, a longtime friend, and we had fun but I didn't get more than about 6,000 steps in each day.  Today, however, back on track--more than 5 miles so far, and I worked out with a trainer today lifting weights and doing core and flexibility work.  MLD tonight for sure, because the weather is funky and barometric pressure change is giving me the aches. Watching the news as I type this...so sad about what happened in Boston today, and I hope anyone in our LE forum with friends or loved ones living or traveling in that city has good news from them this evening.

If you haven't already, look into the links I posted just above, for some exercise guidelines specific to LE risk of LE.  For the paddling, just keep in mind that paddling is a double-trouble activity for those with or at risk of LE--not only are you moving your arm and torso against resistance, it's an incredibly repetitive movement.  Both unaccustomed resistance and repetition are tough for a compromised lymph system to handle.   So, before you pick up that paddle, make sure that you've given yourself lots and lots of time to build muscle strength slowly and steadily, so your arm will be ready for the resistance load.  Then start with a short paddle and work up from there.  I paddle long and hard, but I didn't get back into my kayak until about 9 months after surgery, during which time I was a very faithful gym person, working with a trainer following the PAL guidelines for weight lifting.  You sure can paddle again, and 9 months may be much longer than you need to get ready for it (for me, seasons and weather had a lot to do with the delay), but don't push it too hard or too fast.  Patience now will pay off later!

He's a world record holder in a powerlifting federation, a pure muscle guy and a wonderful, wonderful human being. To help him with his LE knowledge and how to adapt fitness work, I arranged to bring a workshop called PALS for Life to his gym. We opened it to area personal trainers and LE therapists and had a great group for a full Saturday. Two area hospitals and one large company helped defray expenses and we charged a nominal tuition; my local community foundation agreed to be the charity of record and collect funds and supervise disbursement, so the hospital and corporate foundations could be sure that all was on the up and up.  It took some doing to convince some of the gyms to send a trainer, but they all agreed it was well worth their time.   If you are feeling energetic, you could do the same--the woman who puts on the workshop (she was the lead personal trainer in the PAL Trial) will travel anywhere--she does need to get paid, and travel reimbursed, but it was all do-able with very nominal tuition to the trainers here.  A link to her is at www.cancersurvivorfitness.com.   When I first mentioned this to Todd, my trainer, his response was 'limfawhata?' but now he is full on board and my best LE ally --a better LE care partner than any of my docs or even my LE therapist.  As the others have said, a willingness to learn and a caring heart are the most important qualifications. I think that if a trainer is willing to read and discuss with you the SUSO handout (http://stepup-speakout.org/Trainer%20doc%20for%20SUSO-040113.pdf), then you are off to a good start.  I do agree that a cancer-center-affiliated or recommended gym is the optimal place to look, but there are lots of places where that does not exist. I'd have to drive 45 minutes to the nearest hospital-affiliated fitness facility. Having a place 8 minutes away to work out, with a trainer who understands my needs, is priceless. I returned to the gym today after a few days off (holiday and a huge family week at my house!).  All the merry making (too much food!) meant I had to do some serious cardio/penance so I did 4 treadmill miles at a speedy clip and a serious grade, to get my heart going, followed by an hour of weight lifting with the trainer.  Hopefully, now I'm back in my regular routine; the last of family leave in a couple more days.

I find it fascinating that they wanted to hear about your side interests, which tells me they are interested in you the whole person. Good sign! Becky, I heat the milk in a double boiler to 185 degrees, cool it in an ice bath to 112 degrees, put in some saved yogurt, and then put it in a bread proofing box that will keep dough at a constant rising temperature (very helpful around here in winter!). I can use it to incubate the yogurt at 110 degrees for five or six hours. I have two pitchers that fit in the proofing box and each holds a half gallon, so I make a gallon of yogurt at a time. When it's set and chilled, I strain it to reduce by half for some very lovely Greek yogurt. The whole process takes a while, but it doesn't require constant attention, and it costs half of what I'd otherwise pay for Greek yogurt made organic milk from pastured cows.   My exercise plan today includes cleaning my house from top to bottom.  Lots of bending and stretching and moving, although not so much cardio, but I say it counts!!",

I've been well occupied by houseguests and work of late, managing some good walking but not much more.  Went salmon fishing on Lake Michigan yesterday, so lots of movement but none from my personal effort. But today was a magnificent walk day.  Went to Grand Rapids, Michigan's ArtPrize event: 1,524 entries in an art competition where people vote for the top prize. The art is displayed in a 3-square mile area of downtown, including tons and tons of outdoor scultpture and other art, with a beautiful river thrown into the exhibition space to boot.  Went with a longtime friend and we walked 6.7 miles, and I think we saw maybe 200 of the entries.  Some is fabulous art; some is well...not so great; and there's lots in between.  The weather was 70 degrees and sunny--an artful day in so many ways!  (I'll end my commercial for Grand Rapids now...this is an annual event that runs for 19 days, and I'm so proud of my backyard for having this wonderful festival of art. )",

I do get to the gym twice a week for weight lifting and make sure I do proper cardio those days, but otherwise, it seems to be just getting lots of steps in to make sure my days are not a total activity bust. Been traveling, too, which doesn't help matters, especially since recent travels have been by car, so no airport walking during layovers. My best fitness news of the day is that my daughter found my missing fitbit! I lost it while in playful pursuit of her son, who is a mighty speedy crawler! Now I just wait until she can mail it back to me, and I'll have my exercise 'conscience' back to nudge me into exercise action. Today I'm in Chicago for some medical stuff, no big deal, but the location is just one block from fabulous Michigan Avenue. The weather is gorgeous, so I plan to spend an hour or two doing some speedy walking up and down the avenue before starting my 3-hour drive home. Maybe with a few stops for window gawking!

Deborah is amazing, and I heard her keynote address at a National Lymphedema Network conference in 2012. If you poke around on google, you can find a video or two of her talking about her LE. So, now that you have a goal to shoot for (well, cross fit competition may not be your goal!), it's important to learn about precautions for weightlifting, resistance training, cardio and other get-stronger-by-pushing-yourself exercise.  Even yoga, which is demonstrated to have wonderful benefits for dealing with LE, often includes elements that push the limits of what we should do when we're returning to exercise and especially when the LE is not yet stable.   You can learn a lot about exercise with LE here: http://stepup-speakout.org/Handout%20doc%20for%20... And when you start exercising again, if you take a class or work with a trainer, here's another version of the document that is meant to be given to trainers, teachers, instructors, etc: http://stepup-speakout.org/Trainer%20doc%20for%20... You might share these documents with your LE therapist, who should be the one to guide you to the point of stability of your LE.  There's been some great research to show that exercise is good for us, including weight lifting, and you'll read about those studies in the documents I linked to.  But all the research studies required the participants to be stable in their LE--not that swelling was gone, but that there'd been a good period with little to no change, no serious flares, etc. before starting the exercise. Take heart--lots of us work out pretty hard, and we've had competitive athletes in our forum, too. We also have some wonderful women whose LE just doesn't want to cooperate, and they exercise carefully and cautiously. So there's no guarantee you'll be the athlete you once were.  But I prefer to look at it glass-half-full and say that there are many reasons to believe you can safely pursue your goals, so long as you're smart about it. Get educated --the documents above will get you started--and make it clear to your therapist that a return to physical strength is a priority for you.   And do post here!  We all dump our frustrations when exercise bites us (I'm currently furious about a tiny knee injury that blew up my leg, arghh!). And we celebrate our steps, miles, races...whether a half mile or a half marathon. Welcome! I'm glad you posted your question. Carol",

I've been buried in a sea of life 'stuff' lately, making exercise (or time for it) a challenge.  My elderly parents are having issues that are keeping me quite busy, another beloved elder --actually my mother-in-law from a prior marriage, but I always thought the world of her, and she was close to my kids--passed away a couple of days ago.  A very close friend was diagnosed with kidney cancer last Saturday, and promptly told it hadn't spread at all...but then this morning was told it had indeed appeared in three other places. Such an unfair roller coaster to put him and his family through! And I'm still struggling to get my knee swelling under control, diligently doing at least my PT exercises and icing the darn thing as I do correspondence and make calls related to all of the above.  Arrrrggghhhhh......life can be a real stinker, sometimes.  There...I feel a tiny bit better.  I did do a good old Leslie Sansone exercise session today, just 30 minutes and really focusing on minimal impact to what is already a low-impact routine.  I also was able to do a pretty good upper body workout.  I've put on some pounds since the knee business appeared, and that is so frustrating! I hope at least some people around here are managing to do some real exercise.  Please report in, to share the morale boost that comes from exercise!",

Hydrate on, mnmbeck.  Lift a glass of water in celebration of the wonderful response you got to your LE needs, and to having the exchange behind you. I'm sure we'll all tilt our glasses of H2O to join you in marking this great milestone!  Heck, I'll make my glass really special:  sparkling water! Carol",

I'm still doing upper-body only, lifting weights with the trainer, who is taking the time normally allocated to legs, and having me do extra abs work.  Yikes!  But that's a good yikes.  Yesterday I had an MRI of my knee and I'll meet with the orthopedic surgeon next week to find out what's what, and if there's a way to fix whatever is going on in there. Meanwhile, I continue to be frustrated that I'm getting about zero cardio in, and I'm feeling the fat just grab onto to my torso like nails to a magnet.  Ick.   Sue/Milehighgirl, I plan to investigate that book!  My LE comes after prophy mastectomy so I got to skip the cancer part, but one of my closest friends is recently diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic kidney cancer.  I will be reading the book to see if it makes sense for me to pass it along...the family is in a tumult right now and they're grasping for ways to try to take control of what understandably feels to them quite uncontrollable at the moment. Does the book describe approaches people have taken that complement conventional treatments, or is it more about alternative medicine?",

In the optimism department, I can say without a doubt that I am stronger and more flexible and have better cardio endurance now, about 16 months after my bmx/recon, than I had before my surgery.  I'm always amazed at how skipping stretches and range-of-motion work can make me feel tight through the chest and shoulders after missing just a day or two. Maybe these constant reminders that I need to keep on working and stretching muscles is what keeps me moving even on days when I don't really feel like it.  And I remind myself all the time that I didn't get this far overnight; fitness comes one workout/one day at a time, and that means when there are setbacks, just keep in mind that you can get your strength back again, one workout/one day at a time, and they don't have to be blow-out, knock-down workouts, either. Just do what you can, trying to do a little more each day! Today I woke up very early and seized the early hour to do a '3-mile fast walk' Sansone DVD, followed by Lebed lymphatic opening, followed by 20 minutes of stretching and ab work.  The rest of my day will be a mix of cooking, eating, and playing with my almost-two granddaughter, with more emphasis on the playing than on the eating!

Yesterday and today I got in lots of steps, but no cardio.  Today was great though, a trip to the zoo with my daughter and grandchildren, who are little enough to want to make all the animal noises and just be silly.  I did just under 12,000 steps today, and yesterday it was about 10,200, including multiple walks to a nearby grocery store as I ran errands to help prepare for my grandson's birthday party.  It's so much better when walking is not just for walking's sake, but part of a fun day when you can forget it's exercise!",

If we did this, would enough people be able to pay to travel to the event, plus say, $50 toward the event costs, to make it happen?  And where (what city) is the most accessible place, with low airfares and hotel prices?  I wonder if it's Las Vegas. I thought of this crazy idea in an email conversation with a friend late last night and really could not get to sleep for all the thinking about it. Thoughts?  I know that air travel is spooky for lots of people with LE.  I do fine with it (in sleeve/gauntlet, of course), but I wonder if it's an impediment to organizing a gathering like this.  Who would travel to a Lymphedema Kick-Butt Weekend?",

I do sometimes feel my LE, as that heavy, achy feeling, and sometimes I get the typical LE tingles.  That's always my signal that I've overdone without compression, so I know I'm not off the hook!  Sometimes I'll be engaged in an activity for a while and then realize ooops, this is pretty repetitive, I'd better put on the sleeve.  So probably I should be thinking about it more than I sometimes do. ",

She has shown me MLD, using her hands to demonstrate, but no long sessions of hands-on therapy. My swelling was always quite mild even when it was visible, and it responded well to my MLD work at home, plus wearing compression when it was visible swelling.  And--I'm just guessing here--I think that the slowly progressive weight lifting, following the PAL guidelines, has given me strength in arm and torso, in a way that has helped me avoid getting flares from some of life's weight-bearing activities. For example, when I travel (like...all the time for my work!), there's no way to avoid picking up luggage. I pack very lightly, but still, my clothing suitcase weighs fifteen to twenty pounds, and my briefcase with laptop is ten to fifteen. I suspect that my LE would bite me big time with some swelling flares if I were not so regularly in the gym training my arms and torso to take that kind of weight in stride.  In a funny way, having LE has been a benefit, because I no longer get the frequent debilitating back problems that once plagued me. Fear of heavy daily lifting and what it would do to my LE keeps me working out and working toward heavier and heavier weights in the gym, and the bonus has been blessed relief from serious back troubles.  And I want to try to avoid a return to the swelling I once had, however minor.  So to the gym I go!  Now, I should end this by saying that I cannot know for sure that weight training has been a reason my swelling is more controlled, and I know for sure that I am at risk of LE worsening, because we are all at risk, lifetime.  Weight lifting does not prevent nor does it cure LE.  We devotees need to be sure to clarify that, for any newbies reading our enthusiastic posts.  I think it's a great tool in the toolbox for managing my own LE, and I encourage anyone with LE to try it...but intelligently, following the guidelines for adding weight in small, measured increments, wearing the sleeve/hand protection, and above all, making sure that the LE is stable before starting--no big changes for three months or so before starting. I'm baking baguettes this morning, and it requires repetitive motion with some oomph..so I'm in my sleeve and gauntlet. Time to go shape some loaves!",

I had been doing strength training in the gym prior to my bmx / snb that led me down the LE road, and when I was recovered from all the recon work and wanted to return to the gym to get my old self back, I was worried about making my LE worse. I found an amazing woman who was the lead personal trainer for the PAL Trial (Physical Activity and Lymphedema), a nice long study that identified ways to limit the LE risk of lifting weights, while still enabling us to get the strength and bone-building benefits of weight lifting. Cathy came to my little town and put on a full day seminar for personal trainers and LE therapists in our area (thanks in no small part to some funding from two hospitals and a wonderful local manufacturer). The trainer that I work out with hosted the session, and wow, did we learn a lot. Key: start low! Even though before my surgery, I was lifting 50 pounds on a chest press, I re-entered strength training using 1-lb dumbbells. It felt like I was lifting Barbie-doll weights, but hey, it was a start, and I moved up consistently. I'm not going to say I moved up fast, because the PAL Protocol calls for leaving lots of time between increments to the weight or to the repetitions. I'm almost back to my 'old' self some 3 years later. Need more time to get back to the 50 lbs--I'm lifting 40 now--but I'm working on it.

The goal with resistance/weight training is to start very conservatively with a small amount of weight, and then progress slowly by adding a small amount of weight about every two weeks.  Guidelines are to add very small increments of weight each time you move up, to try to avoid muscle soreness (which the lymphatic system can interpret as injury/inflammation and respond with lymph, i.e. swelling).  With dumbbells or gym weight machines, we know how much we're adding.  With a resistance band, it's not possible to know.  Plus, you might grip it in different spots from exercise to exercise or session to session, which will change the resistance even if you don't really intend to.  Same is true with bodyweight exercises.  I can put less resistance on my arms and trunk if I do a wall pushup compared to one on the floor, and I can add resistance gradually by lowering the angle of my pushups, using a bench for example.  But I cannot know how much resistance I am adding with each angle change, and that's the problem.",

Right after PT today I had to drive three hours to a work destination, and I was stiff and sore in the shoulder and arm on arrival. So after I got settled in the hotel, I opened up a good old Leslie Sansone video on my laptop and did three miles of her 'walking.' I've been out of cardio so long that I was able to get the heart rate up without trying too hard, and between the Leslie workout and my normal walking around the house and other incidental steps, I reached my fitbit 10,000. And as always works for me, the stiff-and-sore muscles feel much, much better after getting the blood moving. Also a mood lifter. I learned this past week that my mother has been diagnosed with lung cancer, with liver mets. She stopped smoking 48 years ago, so this seems so unfair, and she survived BC from age 38. At 85 she feels she's not going to put up a fight, and we're all supportive of her palliative care decision, but still...plenty of sad thoughts are poking around in our family. Exercise is such a powerful way to get a little break from that! Glennie, hooray on enjoying the canoe! To me, there's nothing like being on the water with a paddle.

Yesterday I had some serious computer issues that required lots of waiting in ten-fifteen minute intervals, as the machine uninstalled, reinstalled, etc. After the first one, when I kept hovering over the stupid monitor watching its progress, I decided to use the time to get some exercise in.  So I ran sprints from my desk to the farthest point away in the house, and back and forth, while the computer got over its issues.  That worked so well that later in the day, I set the kitchen timer to do the same thing three more times, for fifteen minutes each.  Becky has done this, using an elliptical, and well, it really does break up the exercise and gives a brain break, too. I do turn on the news as I do this sprinting, to help keep it from feeling so monotonous.  I plan to do more of this, although at least three times each week I will still do minimum 45-minute cardio of some sort, to make sure I'm building endurance. Yesterday was a weight training day for me, too, and I jogged a mile on a treadmill after my lifting session.  My total for the day was 7.2 miles.   Our snow largely melted in the past few days, but it is now snowing again, and we expect that by tomorrow there should be enough piled up to get out on the snowshoes.  I'll take that over treadmills or hallway sprinting any day!

This morning I got up at 5:30 for two flights home, so did some um... 'speedy' MLD before dashing for the airport. Wore sleeve and gauntlet.  Went to the gym for an appointment with my trainer, who attended a PALS for LIfe workshop at the gym in December, so he and other area trainers could learn what they need to coach women with and at risk of LE. I am up to 5-lb weights for upper body work, and when I'm home, it's 3x per week with the trainer. Honestly, I'm chicken to do it without him, both out of fear of losing form and triggering an LE event, and more so because my diep recon's body-part rearrangement has me being very cautious about slow-but-sure core strength work.  Oh--I am most proud that I went to the gym an hour before my training time, and I hopped on the treadmill for one hour, including running a bunch of 5-minute intervals.  Usually I do not wear the sleeve/gauntlet for cardio work --wear an Under Armour instead--but this time, thinking about today's two flights, I wore the sleeve and gauntlet on the treadmill and of course kept them on for weight lifting afterward.  My pedometer reads 10,464 steps at this moment, and that's without resorting to taping it to my knuckles to cheat at my keyboard! I ate like a saint today (so far) and today's model behavior is only possible because I ate too much and moved too little yesterday, and guilt apparently works really well for me! For sure I have a correctly-paced MLD session still on my agenda today, especially because I really do know that I should not have lifted weights on a flight day. It's just so discouraging to work up to 5 lbs in baby increments, knowing that if I miss two sessions in a row, I must back off the weight. I missed one of my resistance sessions this week so just could not face missing another one, which would have me moving backwards on those weights.  Truly, I just want to move forward in my strength training.  In the 'old' days, if I missed a session of what was then much heavier weights, getting back to it just meant risking some extra soreness.  Now, LE means that missing two sessions risks more than just some muscle ache, unless I return to the weights cautiously, i.e. lowering the pounds.  So I chose to lift, despite flying today, which normally makes me ache. Hefting suitcase, computer, etc. all week reminds me why it's so important to do strength training. I have to be able to lift 'stuff' in daily life, and I need to reduce my chances that will trigger swelling. My understanding is that slow, cautious resistance training is how to prepare the body for daily-life heavy lifting. Another reason that skipping a session weighs heavily on me, no pun intended. Wow this is long. Sorry! Kira, I hope you shake up the LE organization, and that today's air travel treated your LE with some modicum of respect. Becky, keep up the inspirational work.  My outdoor walking takes me to a dam, which is 2 miles down the road from my house. How funny we both have such a thing in our walking agendas! And Kira, we're on a lake and you can come hop in our kayak any time you like!  (Maybe wait 'til summer; it is Michigan after all.) Carol",

My LE is in my left arm, so I have better arm movement if I'm the passenger (of course, avoiding punching the driver!).  But I think for me, it's more the fact that as passenger, I'm changing body position a lot, and just moving a lot more than I can as a driver. I teach seminars for a living, and long before I had LE, I have always invited people to stand up, pace around...whatever they need to do if they have back or other issues that make sitting all day a challenge. People are almost never asked to sit immobile in chairs all day on their jobs, but we ask them to do that when they come to training, so the facilitator really should be explaining that it's ok to get up and walk around or stand or whatever at any time during the day.  Tell your seminar facilitator that for health reasons, you will be moving around a bit, and then choose a seat near the back of the room so you feel comfortable doing so. I sit only during the lunch break and even when working at home, writing training, I probably sit no more than an hour during any day, as I work at a standing desk.  I sure do agree that sitting invites LE trouble.",

All I can say is that I am earnestly hoping that all this walking has cancelled out the food on the calories in/ calories out equation. Today was a good walking day: 22,015 steps for 10.4 miles.  I just started using a pedometer about a month ago, and I will say that it certainly keeps me honest about the exercise during the day.  When I'm on an elliptical, it does not capture the steps very well, because it needs vibration and the machine is too smoothe.  But for everything else I'm likely to do-walking, Leslie Sansone DVD, or treadmill work, the pedometer keeps tabs and even if it's off a little bit, there's no denying when I get toward the afternoon and haven't had adequate exercise.  Like having Jiminy Cricket clipped to my waist. On the LE care side of things, I drank buckets of water today (not even remotely tempted by any of the Irish national beverages!). I did morning MLD and will end with MLD in a few hours. Also I'll do some stretches, including some of the Lebed opening tonight. Then crash. My little legs are tuckered out. Becky, it's a triumph that you exercise even when you don't want to.  I don't like to exercise, either, but I do love how I feel after I do it, and especially when I've been consistent and realize I have a lot more spring in my step than before I was working on being fit.  Exercise this week has been easy, because it has been mostly fun. Next week I have a few days of the real world, and then another long trip for work, but I won't have my DH to walk with so will have to work harder to stay motivated.  Carol ",

A monitor is a life saver and I'm so glad you caught this on returning to the house.  Aside from that scare, it sounds like you are staying in motion and having fun doing it, so you must be windshielding this week.   I had a pretty good day, ending the workday with a one-hour walk that included a couple of miles on a riverwalk and a pretty steep hill, which certainly got my heart's attention when I had to climb it on the way back from the river. All told, I logged 5.6 miles today. I'll confess to feeling pooped now! I'm crabby too, because at my LE therapist's suggestion, I was measured for a bra and worked with the lingerie shop owner to find one with particular support in a spot on one noob that pools with fluid.  I wore it yesterday and thought it made the problem worse, but today I tried again, doing a good bit of bend/wiggle/shake when putting it on, to try to position that girl just right.  Didn't help, and when I changed into walking clothing, I was not at all happy with the outcome. Good thing I brought a second bra I can switch to.  I fear this means I'm headed for a custom bra, and that saddens me, because of both the process and expense to go through to get one, and the image I have that these things are basically torture devices.  Please, someone tell me that a prescription compression bra doesn't have to strap you in like you're going to hang from a parachute! On all other fronts, it has been a great day; the walk was beautiful in very pleasant weather, so good feelings outweight complaints for sure.  And Tina, I cannot believe it has been a month since you started this!  I am sure that had you not initiated this community, there are days I would have skipped exercise, MLD, etc., but reporting in to everyone here saved me from myself!  Thank you for getting us going.

We live in the woods, literally, and on a very large lake. Mosquitos, ticks, bees/wasps, spiders...it's one big insect-bite minefield. The bugs aren't out in force yet, and it wasn't too hot to cover up completely today, but before too long, I guess I'll need to bathe in bug repellant. So my question, as we've been chatting about dogs here:  Why isn't there a product for humans similar to the Canine Advantage product we put on our dogs to prevent flea bites? It also works for ticks, although I my vet once told me it does not repel ticks, but kills them before they have enough time to transmit bacteria into the dog.  The thought of such a systemic drug is horrid, and I really don't think such a thing exists for people.  But wouldn't it be nice to have alternatives beside covering up head to toe, or bathing in deet?  Carol",

Those 90 minutes were not terribly strenuous, although it showed me that once I'm on the board out on lake water, the paddling can indeed be rigorous. The good news is that if you do it correctly, you work your core more than your arms.  Less good news is that it still works your arms!  So, I continue to search for a compression solution I can wear while wet.  Oh, and I also concluded that as a beginner, the chances of falling in are at least 100%!  Even though I'm an experienced kayaker.  But it is really fun, so I want to do it.   I found a source online for athletic compression sleeves, and they even have graduated compression like our sleeves, although they say 'not therapeutic compression strength'--but probably at least as much as an UA shirt, with the added advantage that it's graduated compression like our sleeves.  Also found a source for athletic compression fingerless gloves. I have sent both companies emails asking for the specific amount of compression, and for their opinions on what happens when the items get wet, and I'll post whatever I learn when I hear back from them.  For now, our lake water is too cold to tempt me to get on the board while I know I'll be falling in.  (Lesson was inside, in a huge pool). So I have time to figure out the compression question. Today is a yukky, rainy day, so my exercise will be indoors.  We had nasty thunderstorms during the night, and I woke up thorugh that feeling mighty achey in my arm. Was it the paddling, the storm, or both?  I did MLD during that awake period and it's a bit better this morning. Carol ",

I asked about activity restrictions, and the only one is no running or jumping, but his opinion is that I can speed walk all I want, use an elliptical, and even get right back into the gym to lift weights--so long as I'm not lying on my chest, which I am not doing for any of my strength training moves.  I think I'll avoid the gym for the rest of this week, but start again on Monday.   My PS is in downtown Chicago. DH is a crafty fellow, and he proposed that we stay here today and tonight--enforced activity reduction compared to what I would do at home! So I will nap a bit (very early wakeup to be at PS by 6:30) and then get outdoors for a leisurely afternoon of walking in what promises to be a beautiful, sunny 70 degree day! On paddling and sleeves-Shows you what a LE newbie I am, because it did not even occur to me to think about seams in the athletic sleeve!  Good catch, Hugz.  Now I think what I'll do is order a new set of sleeve/gauntlet and use my original set for paddling and other potentially dirty activities. The only question is whether I might be better in a LE glove instead of the gauntlet for paddling, as I'm wondering if the top of the paddle handle might just tend to work itself under the wide opening of the gauntlet, more or less defeating its purpose.  Any thoughts on that question? Also, Binney was kind to PM me and tell me that I wasn't quite right on the issue with getting the sleeve wet--it's not that tightens as it dries poses a problem, more so that it gets heavy when wet; and wearing a wet sleeve can invite damp/fungus-y issues, although I think the sun would help dry the thing before that would cause a problem.  Thank you, Binney for the added perspective, and I'm mentioning that here in case anyone else ever searches for LE and paddling looking for similar insights.   The idea of an athletic sleeve that dries very quickly is appealing. But Hugz, your therapist's comment on wet sleeves not being a problem is very reassuring, so thanks for asking!  My own therapist didn't have an opinion one way or the other, and I think it's because such a question can only be answered out of long experience--it's not likely to be covered in a textbook.  My therapist does not see many LE patients, and I am aware that she does not provide the depth of expertise that others get. But--within a reasonable drive, LE therapy availability is limited for me. Which is a good way to end this too-long post, with the addendum that what would I do without all the wonderful resources all of you bring to this forum???? Carol ",

Someone really should develop a compression sleeve made of a slightly open weave, fully synthetic fabric that provides the needed compression but does not retain any water. What is so hard about that? (Lots, I know...) Cooka, thanks for the details of how you solve the paddling-with-LE problem.   Carol ",

      "Content": "Apr 22, 2012 10:33AM carol57 wrote: Tina, Send a huge happy birthday to your DH!  We know he's a great fellow...flew down in your stead to help when your mom needed encouragement for her PT/rehab; spells you for heavy stuff---deserves a celebration! Ohio4me, First, some background: I usually do not see swelling in my arm since taking control with twice daily MLD, frequent belly breathing, exercise and compression wear a while back, and these days, I wear compression sleeve/gauntlet while flying and working out, but (knock on wood) don't need them otherwise. So--take my experience in the context that I have pretty mild LE at this point, and if yours is more developed, you may have more travel and flight issues. I do seem to have more trouble with long flights than with short ones (say, 3.5 hours or more).  Ups and downs don't have a big impact.  I live in a secondary air market, so almost every trip requires a connection, and that first flight ranges from 20 minutes in the air to about 75 minutes. When I'm on a long flight day, I think the length of a cross-country flight coupled with what we do while traveling that we don't do at home, is what makes my arm ache and tingle, and can trigger visible swelling of my truncal spot below my armpit.  Someone posted an interesting video a while back, of a LE therapist talking about air travel. She maintained that it's not necessarily the pressure change in the airplane that makes us think air travel exacerbates our LE, but that while traveling, we put ourselves thorugh lots of unusual activity--lifting heavy suitcases (even if just to/from car trunk, up onto TSA belt, etc.), carrying an extra large purse or 'personal item' in airline terms; and we move these things totally un--ergonomically (guilty here!!!). Then, we eat airport and hotel and restaurant food (= too much sodium) and we drink less water because it's less available and/or we don't want to have to use the icky airplane bathrooms. And in the airplane, we sit, immobile, not wanting to disrupt other passengers or get in the way of the beverage cart.  Sound familiar?  I think that LE therapist has a point about all the challenges of controlling LE while traveling, although Binney has posted some very interesting stuff in the past about the impact of altitude on LE, so I'm not buying the part of the video spiel that says the cabin pressure (pressurized only to 10,000 feet) does not add to the problem. So...what to do?   You can drink more water. I bought a camelback water bottle wtih a taste filter in it, so I no longer spend $3.99 on a little bottle of water, since we cannot bring cheaper, grocery story bottled water through security. Can fill from any water source and it tastes good!. Bottle was not cheap, but savings on airport water has recovered that cost many times over by now. The replacement filter is about $10, but lasts for 350 gallons. That's a lot of water! You can make your fist and pump your arm up in the air, ten times, doing this every hour or so on long flights, and at least once on really short ones.  Who cares what the neighbors think?  I do try to sit so my LE arm is on the aisle, so I'm not arm-pumping right next to anyone's head. At the window, the curve of the aircraft wall makes it hard to pump straight up. You can belly-breathe really often. You can walk at the airport!  My connecting airports are usually Detroit, Minneapolis, or Atlanta, and they are huge airports.  I usually have a long hike to get to my connecting gate, but then I add as much additional time as I can manage, given the schedule, and stay moving at a very fast pace. I wear a pedometer so I know my mileage, and I try to make sure that I'm getting at least 30 minutes and 4,000-5,000 steps in.  Sometimes the bobbing and weaving around other folks slows me down, but I can get a lot of steps into a small amount of time. This means making sure that I'm not carrying anything on my shoulder, so I use a very lightweight and small rolling briefcase for what I must have on the plane with me.  I check my clothing bag now (never did check pre-LE but oh well...) but I teach seminars that require a laptop, often a printer, and sometimes I have to bring a projector. Plus I have my instructor guides, which tend to be bulky, plus my ever-present bottle of water...this all has to roll.  On airport concourses, bags seem to roll with little drag because the floors are nice and even. I do find that the older style, 2-wheel versions work better than the 4-wheel spinners (seems I'm always lifting that one over little curbs and impediments that a 2-wheel version just glides over).  Long story short, with a good little rolling bag, you can move fast, get lots of steps and exercise in, without pulling on hand, shoulder, or causing back problems. Emphasis on little...you need to check bigger/bulkier/heavier bags if you're going to get exercise in while moving through airports. On long connections, I've been known to get as many as 5 miles in an airport, moving fast enough to pump up my heart rate. I wear comfortable clothing and keep the pace just under where I would start to sweat and transform into an undesirable seat-mate.  Fortunately, I don't sweat until I'm really worked up (which I maintain is one reason it's so hard for me to lose weight!).  I imagine that there have been some airport folks who have seen me tearing through the corridors, at first thinking I'm late for a flight, and then eventually feeling sorry for me because I'm late AND don't seem to know where my gate is!    I used to feel pretty beat at the end of a travel day, but in truth, since deciding to make use of airport time to get some fast-paced walking in, I really do feel energetic on arrival.  And exercise is good for our LE.  If you try this approach, pull the little bag with your non-LE arm (you're not bilateral LE are you?), obviously to avoid the weight, but also so that you can pump your LE arm a bit as you walk, to get the nice muscle action against the compression sleeve, to move the lymph. Finally, some women say they do MLD while flying.  I don't attempt full LE (under a huge sweatshirt? Not sure how they do that; maybe 15 minutes in the icky bathroom?), but I do clear the neck nodes a few times in flight.  And I do full MLD as soon as practical on arrival to hotel room or home. So...it's all possible with some planning and effort. Oh, and I am a life-long Buckeye transplanted a while back to Michigan for DH's job. Family is all in Cleveland and Columbus.  We like beautiful west Michigan a lot, but Ohio is still home! Carol",

The program lets you keep a running record of your activity; the fitbit transmits information to the computer via bluetooth whenever you're near the computer.  With an iPhone, you can do the same kind of thing with a phone app.  The program lets you set a calorie-deficit goal that's useful if you want to go to the trouble of logging in your food, and want to lose weight. You tell it what you ate and it knows how much you're moving and tells you when to stop eating if you want calories out to exceed calories in by say, 500 calories.   All the models do these things, but not all have the same kind of display on the fitbit itself.  I really like mine, because it keeps me honest about how much activity I'm doing. It seems to be most accurate at simple walking or running, and in my case, it counts paddle lifts when I attach it to my kayak paddle. There are other brands of similar activity monitors.  I think if you google fitbit, or look it up on Amazon, you'll find lots of choices.",

      "Content": "May 8, 2012 10:01PM carol57 wrote: I have such a fiesta of compression shirts, I feel like they should just define 'trial and error' as Carol57!  Recently I found some for the crazy price of $12 or so.  The vendor (online) is Go Athletic Apparel. They are short-sleeved, mens small, which is the same shirt I wear in UA (heatgear) when I am working out and wearing my sleeve/gauntlet. When not working out or flying, I don't need the sleeve (knock wood), so I quite often wear a long-sleeved compression shirt, especially when working from home. Now that it's getting hot, I'll try short-sleeved versions without the sleeve, and see how that feels. The reason I have tried a fair number of compression shirts is that I just hate the feeling of a high, tight neck, including turtle necks, and I want to have some that I can wear under professional clothing without it being visible.  So I have looked quite a bit for alternates that offer a lower neckline.  I have some that I like (Time for Me catalog) that are more shapewear scoop shirts than compression shirts (not wicking fabric), so I wear these when I need to be in normal-looking clothing, as they disappear pretty well under my wardrobe items.  I also found an online vendor (AstroSports) who hand sews compression shirts; I think she makes items for skating teams.  Her shirts have a nice neckline, but the sleeves are soooo long I cannot picture anyone having arms that long. The inside finish is not as nice as a 'manufactured' shirt.  But--for someone hard to fit, I'll bet this lady would be a good bet to ask to modify her pattern to fit, perhaps wider/narrower shoulders, longer/shorter sleeves, etc. I tried the new Go Athletic Apparel shirts on and they fit well, but I have not worn them yet, as I am wearing a padded bra over nipple protectors to keep from squishing my recon nipples, recently acquired. So I am reluctant to put a compression shirt on over or without that get-up.  But for the price, I believe I'll be sticking with this company if the shirt turns out to stay comfortable during a day's wear. Tina, I think the trick to using a compression shirt as a stand-in for an official compression garment, is to make sure it's small, but not to the point of cutting into you.    AND, this whole question of shirts etc. that comes up so often makes me wonder if we should create a Pinterest page for LE wear!  I know zilch about Pinterest, probably not even spelling it correctly, but my daughter suggested I could use it to share items of interest to my LE friends, and from her description, I think she may be onto something. Is anyone using Pinterest to be able to say if this makes sense or not?  And if so, to get it going?  By the way, I got more walking in after my anger walk, including some time this evening when I walked to dinner. Today's tally is 6.7 miles on my pedometer.  Maybe I should get mad more often :) Carol ",

When we walked, I didn't check starting and ending distance, so I have no way to know how long our walk was.  I know we walked a long distance, and then DH and I walked a few more miles when we got to our destination.  What I do know for sure is that you walk FAST!  You had me working hard to keep up!  It was at least 3.5 mph. I am home now, but I was working in Los Angeles Monday until Thursday.  Got in lots of steps, because I purposely put myself in a hotel that was far from the building I needed to work in.

Last night of all things, leg cramps woke me up twice, ouch! I wondered if it was because I did my outdoor mileage in supportive sandals, but sandals nonetheless instead of true walking shoes.  Today I taught a seminar all day and then walked 3.5 miles in proper shoes. Now off to dinner and then I'm hoping for some better quality Z's!  And today I also managed to drink more water than yesterday, so perhaps that too will help prevent a repeat of the leg cramps. Honestly, isn't the LE ache in the arm enough, without having calves bark at me too???? Nitocris, I hope you can wear down some barriers through sheer persistence.  I'm cheering for you! Carol ",

KS, your eating plan sounds delicious.  When I travel for work, I am usually without a car, but still I can almost always do some shopping for healthy foods for breakfast and lunch, the evening of my arrival. I can usually find a bag of pre-cut raw veggies in a market, or a convenience store, or sometimes a drug store, and that's what I eat for lunch, with a cup of Greek yogurt (for its high protein) that I find in the same place. And some fruit..that's easy to find.  If I'm lucky enough to have a hotel room with a refrigerator, I buy several days' worth when I'm in one place for that long. Sometimes I buy a yogurt-based veggie dip or a small container of hummus to dip my veggies in.  I have a small insulated lunch bag that folds flat, and I use that to pack a lunch that I take to my seminars when I leave the hotel in the morning. If no refrigerator for storing it overnight after I buy it, I just fill a small ziplock with ice and use my little lunch bag as a cooler.  For in-room breakfast I use the coffeemaker to heat water for my little packets of instant oatmeal with extra fiber, which is too sweet for my tastes, so I put a square of Ghirardelli baking chocolate in it. It's so good that way, I can pretend I'm really in the hotel restaurant eating Danish.  So, I eat very healthily for breakfast and lunch, and at dinner, I can enjoy myself. Nothing crazy, but I relax about what I'm eating, knowing that for the full day, I'm fine on fat, calories, and sodium.  Not that all of this helps me lose weight while traveling, but it keeps it stable, and I feel like I'm helping my LE by limiting restaurant traps to just once each day. Are we SURE that gin in the tonic water negates its anti-cramping effect? Carol",

Today I got my fitness routine back!  After three weeks of nonstop work travel, I was able to return to the gym and re-start my weight lifting. I backed the upper-body weights back by 20-25%, following the PAL precautions, and it felt simply great. I felt strong enough to lift heavier weights, but better to be safe than sorry, and even with the lighter weights I was able to wear my muscles out enough to get that tired-but-relaxed feeling.  I also did a 40 minute Leslie Sansone DVD, and that's a first for a while too, because after nipple recon about a month ago, followed a week later with a small breast revision, I was avoiding all bouncy, jouncy cardio and pretty much stuck to just walking. So, I raised my arms and did knee lifts and leg lifts to my heart's content without worrying about any fragile body parts being jiggled. All in all, a very successful day for me. Carol",

Tina, I think it's ok to compare to another person's exercise achievements when the point of the comparison is to draw inspiration.  When I was playing the yes/no head game over taking the time to walk all those miles to the bank and back, I thought specifically of Becky and decided I should take a cue from her and just do it.  And I didn't even have a zillion needle sticks to threaten my resolve.  And from you, Tina, I take to heart the amazing grace and patience you have with setbacks, be they needing implant deconstruction or fighting for insurance coverage or now, keeping your fitness goals in front of mind as you patiently wait for the foot to heal.  Hugz inspires too, as does everyone else here.  You are so right when you say how valuable this support is for coping with LE ups and downs.",

You grasp some handles for a few moments and the sensor reads your heart rate.  That can help you figure out how to get your heart pumping at the right amount of exertion, using a combination of incline percentage and belt speed.  If you have any problems at all with speedy walking, another way to get the benefit of exercise is to choose a slow speed but increase the incline.",

And I fell in once, after getting unbalanced while trying to dig into the water for more power. It was really hot, so the water felt great. And at bedtime, I took extra long for MLD, hoping to ward off aches. This morning, no unusual arm aches or issues, so all seems well. The SUP lesson I took stressed the importance of using abs instead of arms to power the board. I worked on that, but must refine that technique. It is storming big time today. I am in my car, waiting for a ferry to arrive, as I am crossing Lake Michigan to work near Milwaukee tomorrow. I was hoping to get an afternoon of walking in, on arrival, but if this weather continues on the other side of the lake, it will be hotel treadmill for me...bah! Oddly, the barometric pressure does not seem to be causing LE ache this morning. I will never figure this thing out! Have a great LE care day, everyone! Carol",

With the exercise, I have double motivation, which is to help control the LE and in pursuit of the ever-elusive weight loss.  But as for MLD and Lebed, I tend to remember those when I'm arm-achey, which means of course that I should have already done them to help prevent the ache.  Oh well. Hugz, my batteries do indeed wear down from all the travel.  I look forward to retirement, but that's a few years off for me.  This week and the next three weeks I am home, but not sure it will be battery-recharge time, because lots and lots of family will arrive starting this weekend, with people arriving and leaving at different times through July 7, but there will be about 20 of us at the peak.  Picture people on airbeds, pullout couches, and fortunately, in a few guest rooms.  Should be fun, especially the 6 who are under the age of 6!",

Today I scrubbed more siding, this time using a ladder because the spiders, well they just crawl all over.  I did that for a long time, thinking it reminded me of the 'reach into the back of the freezer' Lebed routine.  Only I was doing it faster and with more oomph, I guess. Anyway, I hope those few hours count as exercise!  I also was able to jump into a pool twice today, and I swam a moderate pace for that time.  Felt great and I was just telling my LE to 'take that!' with all the nice water pressure.

All that to say that if I ever sound a bit obsessive about the activity level, it's because I'm afraid not to stick with it.  I never want to go back to being a desk potato.  But I know I'm capable of it.  It's bizarre, but LE is a big part of what motivates me to stick with it.  I don't want my LE to progress, so in a way that thought is about as petrifying as when I was quaking in my boots thinking about my long surgery.  Thank you, LE...but that's ALL I'm going to ever thank my LE for!

Watch out for her DVDs that include stretchy bands. One is 'Walk Away the Pounds Ultimate Collection' I has a 1-mile, a 2-mile, a 3-mile and a 4-mile walk.  So you can start out with shorter distances, see how your LE tolerates, and then move upward.  But-the stretch band is a big part of some of the walks included, and that means trouble for us LE -ers, because it's not possible to know how much resistance they give, nor to increase the resistance in small, gradual increments.  I sometimes do her DVDs that use the bands, only without the bands, so of course it's possible to work around them.  But I find that without using the bands, the footwork is not active enough to keep the heart rate up, so for best cardio results, either use a non-stretch band workout, or just know you will have to modify the moves to do more with your legs as she is working with the resistance bands.

But I do know that it's not helping the cyst and swelling any when I do that.  So far, I've been told that there's not a surgical solution, but a wonderful friend who's a physician is nudging me to not buy that explanation and to seek another opinion from an orthopedic surgeon. The stakes are high for me--not only do I want to continue my workouts, walking and snow shoeing, our house sits on a high bluff above a lake.  We have 90 steps down to the water, and I seriously need to stay in shape to be able to use the water...it's where we keep my beloved kayak!!!  So I need to be able to exercise my legs, do strength training, and move fast enough to keep the heart strong.  ",

Our meanderings included a brief foray into Whitefish Bay, which was very windy and with a strong current, so we headed back upriver to our tents. Maybe if we had sea kayaks!

On the oil question, I use avocado oil a lot, and it has a very high smoking point. Also some nut oils, although there can be a pronounced taste, so it has to be in something where a slight nutty taste is good.  I use both of these to make vinaigrette from time to time, in place of olive oil.  We have several places not far from home that let you taste oils and vinegars, and the variety is astonishing.  It's easy to get carried away!",

By the way, this week two people asked me about the sleeve, very politely--both were young women who said they knew what it was because their mothers wear them when flying, too. We live in the woods on a lake, and there are many, many forests and recreation areas quite nearby. I love walking in the woods, too.  Dawne, your post makes me think I should make a special effort to do that this weekend. That would help immunize me from more frustrating walks I know I'll be taking when I leave again for more air travel on Monday. By the way, congratulations on the cross-country running.  What a great youth-recapture strategy!  Carol ",

The Lebed exercises are designed to promote the movement of lymph through the body, which is a great strategy for any of us who lost lymph nodes. Your GAP recon makes me suspect that you may not struggle with the scourge of overweight that has been challenging me all my life--I'm just guessing here--and if I'm right, the implication for you is huge. Women who are overweight at the time of surgery have a markedly higher LE risk than women of normal weight. You lost just a few nodes, and if your PS recommended GAP because tummy fat was hard to come by...with luck the combination signals a low LE risk. I hope so, anyway!  In any case, you can exercise to gain all its health-related benefits without increasing LE risk if you incorporate the LE precautions in your exercise routine. And you're incredibly smart to be learning about LE, so that if it does come your way, you'll recognize it and seek treatment at the earliest possible moment.  For more information about LE, browse the stepup-speakout.org site, which is a wonderful resource for all of us here.",

Wish I could jump start us with a fabulous exercise report, but I spent the last few days driving 11 hours round trip, with three days in between spent packing and moving boxes around. I was working with my son and daughter to pack up my parents' home after their recent relocation to a senior community. I got lots of steps and tons of stairs as I was moving from one level of the house to the next. Not to mention my strength training, i.e. the boxes. But this was not the kind of endorphin-producing exercise I would prefer to do. I'll be traveling for work this week and will need to do my in-hotel-room cardio routine every day to get the blood flowing again! How is everyone else faring? I'll bet the recent weather has dampened some exercise spirits.",

Now I'm wondering about the safe limits of cross-body reaching. I'm not scheduled for PT for at least two more weeks, and the folks there will not even answer a question until I show up with the referral (grrr). It's easy enough to bring my left (LE) hand over to my right (surgery side) hand to get these garment started, and I am permitted to use my surgery-side hand so long as it's somewhere in front of my body at waist level, and I'm not putting a lot of force on it. Within those restrictions, I can get sleeve or night garment to my elbow and a bit beyond, but to yank the garments up to the axilla would pull my surgery shoulder to the left a bit, and I just don't know if that's endangering the sutures and anchors. Gosh, literally it just dawned on me that I can call the orthopedic surgeon's office tomorrow to ask... And it sure seems like I could use some OT as I'm waiting for the healing to permit the PT! I do remind myself that this too, shall pass, and I am mindful and respectful of the military vets and others who must live with missing or compromised limbs forever. Mine are truly minor frustrations. If my LE flares for lack of compression or MLD for a while, I will at some point regain my ability to manage it again.

Several women in this forum are participating.  The rest of us are pretty much on our own to find therapists and ideally, personal trainers, who are familiar with the PAL Protocol and can design a weight-lifting program that reflects its guidelines.  The PAL research office has a handout that shows photos of the actual weight training moves they used while conducting their research over 18 months, but they give that document only to certified personal trainers and lymphedema therapists. Those individuals can request a copy here:    www.penncancer.org/physical-ac... I think the UPenn folks are sometimes pretty slow to respond to those requests, because they're not really staffed to accomodate all the requests they get.  Fortunately, a good personal trainer and most physical therapists should be able to customize a standard weight training program based on reading the original PAL research article, plus a follow-up article that lead researcher Dr. Kathryn Schmitz wrote for the NLN, clearing up misconceptions about the PAL Trial conclusions.  Here are some links: www.lymphnet.org/pdfDocs/PAL_N... .  www.lymphnet.org/pdfDocs/Weigh... The second document I linked to is a very good read for patients, too, and I highly recommend it. If you are considering starting a weightlifting program, please consider finding a personal trainer to get you started.  Form is so important, and even without the worry about LE issues, if you have poor form, you can injure yourself, and who needs to add that on top of all our LE issues?  Personal trainers can be expensive, but some cancer centers and some Y's give access that's free or at reduced cost for cancer survivors, so that may be a way to get some good help.  Y's that participate in the LiveStrong program of exercise for cancer survivors get some PAL training for their instructors.  I think they watch a 90 minute web seminar, so they should be familiar with the PAL guidelines. Here are some highlights, to get a sense of what PAL is all about (and I am paraphrasing here, and adding my own comments, so PLEASE read the 'misconceptions' article at minimum): --Make sure your LE is stable before you even think of starting a weight training program. Dr. Schmitz says that means no cellulitis that required antibiotics over the past three months, and no mroe than one LE flare that required CLT therapy in the past three months. No arm volume fluctuations of greater than 10% during the past three months. --Start with very, very light weights and move up very, very slowly.  I was lifting extensive weight prior to surgery, but when I returned to the gym afterward, I started with one pound dumbbells for my arms and other upper-body lifts.  Talk about feeling silly...but LE is nothing to fool around with, so I gritted my teeth and decided who the heck cares what it looks like.  Then I added weight slowly, meaning one pound per week, initially. --Use dumbbells or other equipment with weights that are marked on them.  Items such as soup cans are handy, but their weights are not standard, so they make it very difficult to know for sure you're adding to your lift load in small, measured increments.  Also, for best form (and form matters, to avoid injuries, LE-related and otherwise), it's best to use dumbbells, for a better grip.  One option is to purchase a set of power blocks that go as low as 1 lb.  If you google it, you'll see what I'm talking about.  That's what they're using in the PAL program in Philadelphia. --Only progress to a higher weight after 2-4 sessions of doing the exercise with proper form and if there have been no changes in your LE symptoms. --If you skip weight lifting for a week, back off the weight. If you skip for a month or longer, start over!  Dr. Schmitz says in her article that the research team hypothesized that when LE got worse during the PAL trial, it was most likely because of irregular attendance at the exercise sessions. If you can't do this regularly, you risk injury (non-LE) and triggering a flare. --Resistance bands are not a safe way to do strength training if you have or are at risk of LE, because you cannot know exactly how much resistance you add or subtract when you alter your hand placement or move to a more resistant band.  One key tenet of the PAL Protocol is that they determined that women have the least chance of triggering LE (or making it worse if they already have it) when weight is added slowly and progressively, in small measured increments.  Resistance bands are tempting because they're inexpensive and easy to store, and if you travel, they go right along with you.  But--they invite more LE risk than relying on measured increments from dumbbells. --And then there are those body-weight exercises, like planks for our abs and pushups for the pectoralis area.  By now you can predict what I'm going to say--not such a good idea for us, because--you guessed it--impossible to say how much added resistance you get when you alter your position to make the move harder.  --This is not to say you NEVER use resistance bands or do push-ups, and even Dr. Schmitz has said it's possible...eventually.  The idea is to build significant strength using the (broken record here, sorry) slow, progressive method with dumbbells.  Then--and seriously only when you have a good long track record of adding your weights slowly--might you begin to add some bodyweight work--and that only if all through your program so far, you never triggered any LE symptoms (ache, heaviness, tingly, and of course, swelling). --If you work with a trainer in a gym, you can certainly use weight machines, although it's harder to start with super-light weights.  Make sure the trainer teaches you how to adjust the machines to your size, and make sure that you start with the lightest possible weight. --Then there's the question of wearing compression while working out.  Anyone who already has LE should be wearing a compression sleeve and hand compression (glove or gauntlet) while lifting weights, and probably while doing cardio work, too (because just raising your core body temp during cardio adds load to the lymphatic system, and then you add to the challenge by using arms for long, repetitive motion in some kinds of cardio work).  The National Lymphedema Network says that whether to wear compression or not is a judgment call when you do not have LE--but are 'just' at risk.  To make that decision, it's best to consult with a qualified LE therapist, generally a PT who is also a certified LE therapist, hopefully with the letters LANA after his/her name. I'm killing you with info here, I know, but LE rots and we do what we can to avoid it, or to minimize flare-ups when we do have it.  Resistance training can do a lot for us, LE and all, but as you can see from all these paragraphs, we have to take responsibility for doing it responsibly.  I know it is working well for me--I'm up to 15-lb dumbbells for some lifts, and that's with a lot of backing off of weights when I have to miss for a week because of work travel.  Considering I have to lift luggage regularly, being able to pick up 30 pounds with my arms is a necessity, so I for one am very grateful to the UPenn team for designing research that helps respond to the longtime advice not to lift more than 10 pounds. Hope this helps! Carol",

We do the best we can with what is available. And we stay vigilent, backing off the weight if we have any sign of a flare, or when we miss a week.  'Slowly progressive' does not mean one pound at a time forever.  I think when you're at heavier weights, it means moving up in reasonable increments, not necessarily one pound.  Also, we can do 'slowly progressive' in other ways. My trainer sometimes has me increase repetitions if I'm ready to move up to say, 13 pounds, but the next available weight is a 15.  Instead of moving from 12 to 15, which might be asking for trouble, he has me do a couple of sessions where my sets include 16 or 18 repetitions at 12 lbs instead of the standard 12 reps.  He tells me that this method gets the arm strong enough to then safely move up to the 15 lb dumbbell--just as safely as if I had a 13- or 14-lb weight.  The weight machines move up in fixed intervals of 5 or ten lbs, and some have half-weight plates, but not all.  So adding repetitions before moving up to the next weight helps protect the arm from a sudden overload. Purple, what an amazing brother!  I hope you get to a place where you can try a formal exercise and weight lifting program, when your LE stabilizes and if other health issues permit. Today I did not move much, ooops.  Work grabbed me and held onto me and I am bummed as a result. Tomorrow I have a gym commitment, though, so I'll be back on the wagon for sure.",

Worked out in the gym, with 20 minutes of walking at 3.5 mph on a steep incline, which always gets my heart pumping. Then 60 minutes of weight training with the trainer, ending with some great stretches and ab work.  No Lebed yet, so I'll try to work that in. I chatted with the trainer about more strategies if we're lifting weights and cannot move up in small enough increments, because the weights jump too much from one dumbbell to the next, or from one machine weight plate to the next.  He has had me add in reps to help bridge that gap, as I explained in an earlier post.  Today he added that another strategy is to slow down the pace of each lift, so that when you are comfortable with, say 6 lbs and the next dumbbell is 8 pounds, stay at your usual number of repts, but concentrate on lifting the 6 lb weight very, very slowly for another week or two before moving up to the 8 pound weight.  Going slowly builds added strength by exposing the muscles to the weight for longer, and also by removing momentum from the lift--your muscles really must do all of the work.  He said to remember to keep it slow on both the lifting motion, and the return motion, i.e. the complete repetition. I don't know if I have the energy to report my food here.  I do it on my food tracker program to help keep my weight in check, but not every day.  I will say that today I had a couple of squares of Ghiradelli 100% cacao, i.e. totally unsweetened.  Delish! And I assume that all those antioxidants are making me younger every minute! Carol",

The program director told me after the workshop that she realized she needed to modify their program and would do so based on what she learned. So that was a real win for BC survivors in that city who use the Y. The Y in the other city is another story. They did not want to hear anything about LE. Their program director told me that. A commitee considered sending someone to the workshop, but decided that LE was not in their strategic plan, which includes only heart disease and diabetes for health outreach efforts for 2012 and 2013. There was no convincing them that BC survivors work out in their Y (which does not offer Livestrong) and are mostly not even aware of their LE risk, so need help on awareness and precautions for weight lifting.

It is easy to use, and it works whether it's clipped to my waist or in a purse or pocket.  One feature that I think is mandatory is a backup leash/clip.  The main clip is strong but moving sometimes causes it to detach from my waistband, but fortunately there is a short leash with its own clip that offers a second chance at not losing it.  I don't know if this is standard, but it's worth making sure that whatever pedometer you get has this second anti-loss feature.

My pedometer is not fancy, although it did come with a leash. I don't think any pedometer is 100% accurate, and really, if it tells you you walked a mile but you really did 0.8 or 1.2, does it really matter that much? The value of the thing to me is that it simply keeps me mindful about moving. Especially when I travel for work, when I am tired, crabby, and could easily just chuck the exercise, the pedometer says to me hey...you want to see a lot of steps tonight at bedtime, don't you? Binney, if you're getting about 7000 steps without making yourself run circles around your house or go on a long walk or jog, I'd say you must be in constant motion! That's amazing! I went for a speedy walk today after teaching my seminar, getting in about 9,600 steps in an hour. It was sunny and nice out so I really enjoyed the walk. MLD coming up soon. Carol",

We love to take our dog to places where he can run like the wind, but those are hard to find, because so many of our beautiful beaches and parks either prohibit dogs or require them to be on a six-foot leash. Janis, good luck sleeping with a contraption attached to your arm.  I would have a hard time with that.  So far I have never needed night time compression, and I think I would have a difficult time adjusting.   Tina, you are clearly married to a saint!  Lucky, lucky Tina! Binney, on my bra issues, it's not that my therapist suggested a custom bra, I'm just wondering if that's an inevitable step.   I need to find a way to put pressure on one breast, pressing in from the midline between the breasts, and up from under the breast. The bra I had professionally fitted seemed at first to take care of that, but apparently after some time wearing the bra, the separator panel between the cups forms a bridge between the breasts instead of holding them separate.  So, no pressure from the midline.  My LE therapist thought a well fitted bra, replacing the softer, more elastic ones I had been wearing, would provide the needed support to prevent fluid pooling near that centerline. It did not work, so back to the drawing board.  Is there a 'J' shaped swell spot that can go into a bra, and if so, does it stay in place, or is a custom bra needed to hold it still?  LE sure does feel like one long and expensive trial-and-error treatment program.

For today's LE care, I can report that I began with some abbreviated MLD, and I will in a few moments end my day with a longer, slower MLD session. As for exercise, I can happily report that I did...nothing!  After work today I relocated to an airport hotel, in preparation for a super early flight home in the morning, and then -- the reason I can HAPPILY say that I skipped my usual evening walk--I had dinner and a 4-hour chat with...Tina337!!!!!!  This week I have been working in a city not far from Tina's home, so we arranged to meet. We had a wonderful chance to swap LE experiences and more important, to get to know a bit about each others' lives outside LE.  Tina showed me her portfolio of drawings, including the one that she uses as her avatar.  Simply gorgeous images that are full of vibrant color and movement! So, we exercised our jawbones, and boy did we get a lot of miles in that way.

I believe that the feel-good moments after exercising helps tremendously to get us back on track, so long as we don't skip exercise so much that we're sore instead of feeling good afterward! Today I skipped morning MLD--up at 4:45 for an early flight, and somehow setting the alarm even earlier just was too much to bear.  I'll play catch up tonight.  I had a flight delay that gifted me with a 3-hour layover, so I used the time to walk.  I did one hour of very speedy walking, fast enough to raise my heartrate, and then another 40 minutes or so at a more leisurely pace. I have about 6.5 miles on my pedometer so far today and will be strolling around beautiful Holland, Michigan this evening with DH! I've been looking at all the 'devices' on the Bandages Plus website, and they don't give dimensions (how helpful is that?) for the swell spots and similar items.  I'll need to invest more time as Binney suggests, looking at the manufacturers' websites to decide what looks like it might work, and then shopping for it online.  Or--have any of you sewn any DIY swell spots? The photos suggest these are not complicated devices.  What is in them? I also am considering getting the Wear Ease Slimmer cami, and I have a question about that, too. Is it comfortable wearing over a bra (so I can get the cup support I need)? Or is the compression configured so that the chest area functions much as a bra would, and I could tuck the needed swell spot(s) in the cami and they would stay put?  I know our fitness group includes of mix of those of us who did recon and those who did not, and some who wear protheses and some who do not (my, we are a diverse group!). So perhaps someone in the wears-a-bra group has an opinion about the Wear Ease Slimmer over a bra (or not to wear the bra). I did just speak with my LE therapist, who must have ESP because she called me to follow up on this very topic from our last visit--calling just as I was typing this post.  She suggests trying to insert some of the Komprex shapes into my bra to add some support from the midline inward.  Anyone have an opinion on Komprex? Thanks for any and all advice-- Carol",

If you search youtube, you can find some samples (I think the youtube versions were recorded separately, but you'll get the idea.  For example: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2luK4JRAbo&feature=relmfu . ) Some of us poke fun at the DVD because it's kind of hokey, but many women here really swear by the method.  You can do this with zero fear of harming yourself! Teach-yourself-MLD is dicey.  A youtube search will find you some examples, and once I found an incredibly detailed printed explanation online.  The problem is two fold:  one, there is a lot out there in pop culture about stimulating the lymphatic system, and it's not necessarily accurate, nor is it necessarily designed to treat lymphedema. Second, there are many variations on performing true, LE-therapy MLD, but what's most important is that the way you do your MLD should be configured to address your LE!  LE is quite individual, and it can move around a lot, so the best strategy really is to have a qualified LE therapist work with you to understand where you have it, how it presents, and then he/she can show you the best way to nudge that lymph in the right direction.  A one-size-fits-all approach isn't likely to work.  For example, your scars from breast surgery might run in a different direction than my scars, and because scar tissue is a real roadblock for lymph flow, we may need different MLD strategies. LE in both arms--yikes, you have a mountain to climb, but as Kira said, Binney not only also has bilateral LE and is our resident expert, she has a huge heart and seemingly endless patience to answer all of our questions.  I think she found the secret to getting 30 hours out of each day.  I'm sure she'll stop by here soon to offer you support and suggestions. Let us know how you're doing, and while you're in our exercise/LE care thread, please feel welcome to post your daily care successes and challenges.  We have a really supportive and caring group going here.

Picture a corner--nowhere for that fluid to go.  Inserting some of the bumpy foam stuff in the bra works to some extent, but it's always temporary, and the area firms up again soon if I stop.  PS and my LE therapist agree this is not LE, but a highly local issue. So, he is going to do a little nip and tuck to round out the area, in other words, removing the spare tissue that doesn't play nice with drainage routes.  I will fit in a bra much better after this, too, so I think it's a good idea and am looking forward to the revision, in a manner of speaking.  On paddle gear, I am ordering a second set of sleeve/gauntlet so I can use my existing ones in the water, but I also found an athletic compression sleeve that is circular-knit, so no seams. And a weight-lifter glove that exerts very nice pressure.  So, when the water warms up, I'll be all set to try the (relatively inexpensive compared to LE stuff) athletic gear to see how that works, and be prepared to move to the LE gear if necessary.  The water is still c-c-cold here, so it will be a while, but I'll be sure to report my experience when the time comes. On the elliptical, I avoid using arms, because I worry about all that repetitive motion tracing the exact same path of movement.  Just sounds like an LE problem in the making. So--I just do it without my arms!  I keep arms at my side, doing a a little arm pumping from time to time, but I'm able to balance nicely without the arms.  Elliptical machines vary, and we have one at home that I use mostly-and if I don't use its arm-thingys, they are not in my way at all.  At the gym, some of the machines would be more difficult to avoid the arm thingys, so I don't use them.  The benefit of no-arm elliptical is that not only does it not tempt fate on the LE question, it becomes a very good core and balance workout!  I think that using arms gets the heart rate up a bit more, but I can get it high enough without the arms so I don't worry about that potential downside. Becky, you know that I love to make bread, so when we eat pizza--usually Sunday nights--I'm making the crust.  I make it super thin and I add a product called resistant starch to the dough, in place of 25% of the flour. RS is a soluble fiber, 100% natural --it's actually a type of cornstarch.  So the crust has more fiber than if I'd made it 100% whole wheat, and the texture does not change at all. Toppings are heavy on veggies and light on meat (had to nudge DH along on that one!). Sunday night's topping featured roasted asparagus and mushrooms.  I love pizza. Always have it with a huge salad, no dressing, just some balsamic vinegar.  Simply have to find a way to put pizza sensibly into the weekly eating plan.  DH, who lives in a hotel M-W nights, has a room with a microwave and fridge, so he brings the leftover pizza with him on Monday mornings. That way, my leftover pizza temptation leaves town. Now, if only all the exercise and healthy eating actually translated to weight loss--stuck, absolutely stuck for about five weeks now!  But I feel great, so that has to count for a lot. Catherine, glad to hear you got some walking and jogging in today.  You'll do more, bit by bit! Carol",

Yet most of them have the initials CLT right next to their OT/PT.  Are you getting therapy from someone who should be qualified, but just doesn't care about taking the time to understand your needs?  On the 'hats off to wrap' thread you'll learn about the giant bandage ball we want to make, holding bad PTs and docs-in-denial inside, and we're going to perch it on top of the Seattle space needle.  Want to be included in the (virtual) unveiling ceremony?

I am wwriting this on my phone and cannot drop in a link, so hopefully someone will come by and give the link to 'finding a qualified therapist' on the stepup-speakout.org website. LE therapy is specialized, and PTs or OTs need additional training to provide effective treatment. Becky and Hugz, a while back I did a web search and found a lot of garment funds, most of them local to cities, counties, states, and a few in Canada. I put my results online in a public Google Docs spreadsheet. Cannot link to that for the weekend as I am traveling, but maybe Binney can drop it in. I found those resources in a few hours and most should be verified by phone. It would be an enormous but WONDERFUL project if women on these LE threads would call their area hospitals, LE clinics, and their local Komen chapters to find and profile garment and therapy assistance. I found lots of evidence of Komen grants for that, but my local exec director says she has no way to generate a national list. Together, we could build my little list into something very helpful to all. Tina...all I can say is \"chocolate coming your way!\" Carol",

I think it's great that Tina started this thread, because it's an ever-present but gentle reminder to take care of ourselves. I am having a hard time getting enough exercise in these days. Last week, I managed to get plenty of walks in, during airport connections and while working in Denver, although I chose to slow down the pace in Denver out of respect for the higher altitide. The weekend was a near total loss for exercise. I flew to where my family all live, instead of flying home, to spend Mothers Day together. DH met me there, and 18 hours after arrival Saturday afternoon, we drove the 6 hours home, and then repacked prior to leaving very early Monday for work on the west coast. Here, seminars to teach but moving from city to city by train each night, and I do not predict much free time to get that desired cardio hour. Even yesterday's flight schedule gave me little time for my usual airport speedy walks. I call all of this frustrating! Last night I could have walked, but chose to have dinner with a much loved nephew instead. I did manage to get the MLD in yesterday; that's something at least. Carol",

The only reason to go through insurance is to make sure the cost gets logged as a contribution toward the deductible.  Someone really should make a computer game called 'outwit the insurance plan' or something. It's a maze, isn't it? Today I did 80 flights of stairs and just under 10,000 steps.  Well, the stairs were included in the 10,000 of course.  I did not literally do 80 ups and downs in the house, which would have probably made me dizzy, but instead, 16 trips up and down our steps to the water. The vertical drop is about 60 feet, or about the same as 5 staircases.  I did most of these at one time--what a heart boost! I was sure dripping afterward and it was not particularly warm here today. Which made it a perfect day to do this crazy climbing.  Made me think of Tina and Hugz, who have done a lot of stairclimbing to get fitness into a day. Carol",

Today I did walk a lot, but it was hardly at a sprint pace.  I walked to a bank appointment, 7.8 miles round trip.  Part of that was on our beautiful, peaceful country road, but much of it was on the shoulder of a very busy truck route through the county.  I had to ditch my hat after a while, because every time a truck passed, the draft would send my hat flying if I didn't catch it fast enough.  I was quite safe--very wide shoulder--but I cannot say it was pleasant walking, mostly because of the traffic noise. I did get my exercise in, though.  My pedometer measures altitude changes, and it tells me I climbed the equivalent of 19 flights of stairs during that walk, which is no surprise because it was kind of hilly.  I'm not sure I'll walk into town again; wish I had Becky's beautiful off-road walk!  I don't mind the activity, but it sure eats a chunk of time, and in today's case, without any truly enjoyable scenery to make it feel relaxing. Tina, you are being so very patient with all the little LE issues going on now.  As to heat from a sleeve, I bought some EdemaWear from Compression Dynamics to try. At about $6 per sleeve, it's an easy experiment to justify.  The sleeve has no stated compression level, but it seems at least as compressive than my 20/30mmhg sleeve. It leaves cornrow marks on the arm.  I don't know that it's graduated compression (don't think so). But--for me, it seems (so far) to be working well, and one benefit is that it's a stockinet mesh, and not in the least hot. I wore it on today's walk, when it was 77 degrees out.  I would say my arm did not overheat at all.  When I returned to the house, I watered the weekend's plantings and got half of my arm wet, and now just 30 minutes later, it's almost dry--thanks to the netting-like fabric.  I cannot imagine this works for everyone, nor would I substitute this for my normal sleeve when lifting weights.  But I decided to see  how it works, because its fabric seems like a good bet for the paddling sleeve I've been searching for.  Maybe something to look into if your regular sleeve is too hot while walking.

It was great exercise, but my arm was a bit achey today, and I wondered if it was the paddling or was it the barometric pressure change that brought a huge thunder/lightening storm this afternoon?  I wore a sleeve and glove while paddling, but still there's a good amount of arm work.  I'll be doing more paddling tomorrow and will pay close attention to cause/effect. It's a lot of fun, so I sure hope my arm can make peace with the activity.

      "Content": "Jul 5, 2012 12:57PM carol57 wrote: Nibbana, I wrote this long post a while back, to answer some questions from women at risk of LE. So some of the comments talk about avoiding  LE, but the information is just as valid for those of us who already have an LE diagnosis and want to build strength safely. If you have been working out in a gym using weights before your LE diagnosis, some of this is old news to you, but I hope what's 'new' will be of help. Guidelines for cautious resistance training--designed especially to address LE risk--were developed as a product of an 18-month research trial called the PAL Trial (for Physical Activity and Lymphedema). Here are some highlights, and I do recommend that you read the related journal articles--I'll put links at the end here. --Start with very, very light weights and move up very, very slowly.  I was lifting extensive weight prior to surgery, but when I returned to the gym afterward, I started with one pound dumbbells for my arms and other upper-body lifts.  Talk about feeling silly...but LE is nothing to fool around with, so I gritted my teeth and decided who the heck cares what it looks like.  Then I added weight slowly, meaning one pound per week, initially. --Use dumbbells or other weights that are marked on them.  Items such as soup cans are handy, but their weights are not standard, so they make it very difficult to know for sure you're adding to your lift load in small, measured increments.  Also, for best form (and form matters, to avoid injuries, LE-related and otherwise), it's best to use dumbbells, for a better grip.  One option is to purchase a set of power blocks that go as low as 1 lb.  If you google it, you'll see what I'm talking about.  That's what they're using in follow-up research being done by the PAL Trial researchers now. --Resistance bands are not a safe way to do strength training if you have or are at risk of LE, because you cannot know exactly how much resistance you add or subtract when you alter your hand placement or move to a more resistant band.  One key tenet of the PAL Protocol is that they determined that women have the least chance of triggering LE (or making it worse if they already have it) when weight is added slowly and progressively, in small measured increments.  Resistance bands are tempting because they're inexpensive and easy to store, and if you travel, they go right along with you.  But--they invite more LE risk than relying on measured increments from dumbbells. --And then there are those body-weight exercises, like planks for our abs and pushups for the pectoralis area.  By now you can predict what I'm going to say--not such a good idea for us, because--you guessed it--impossible to say how much added resistance you get when you alter your position to make the move harder.  --This is not to say you NEVER use resistance bands or do push-ups, and even Dr. Katie Schmitz, the lead PAL researcher, has said it's possible...eventually.  The idea is to build significant strength using the (broken record here, sorry) slow, progressive method with dumbbells.  Then--and seriously only when you have a good long track record of adding your weights slowly--might you begin to add some bodyweight work--and that only if all through your program so far, you never triggered any LE symptoms (ache, heaviness, tingly, and of course, swelling). --Then there's the question of wearing compression while working out.  Anyone who already has LE should be wearing a compression sleeve and hand compression (glove or gauntlet) while lifting weights, and probably while doing cardio work, too (because just raising your core body temp during cardio adds load to the lymphatic system, and then you add to the challenge by using arms for long, repetitive motion in some kinds of cardio work).  The National Lymphedema Network says that whether to wear compression or not is a judgment call when you do not have LE--but are 'just' at risk (oh, and risk after SNB is not trivial--up to 17% for arm LE and much, much higher for breast LE if you had SNB and breast-conserving surgery, and especially if rads are thrown in).  To make that decision, it's best to consult with a qualified LE therapist, generally a PT who is also a certified LE therapist, hopefully with the letters LANA after his/her name. (I'm killing you with info here, I know, but LE rots and we do what we can to avoid it, or to minimize flare-ups when we do have it.) It's a great idea to work out with a certified personal trainer at least a few times, and a trainer can request the actual PAL workout guidelines by going online here:  http://www.penncancer.org/physical-activity-and-lymphedema/receive-pal-intervention-materials/ I live in a rural part of w. Michigan and am nowhere near any gyms that offered PAL-compliant personal training, so I recruited support from two hospitals and brought one of the PAL researchers to town last December, for a one-day workshop she gave to a group of personal trainers and LE therapists. So now we have some good PAL training resources here.  You could do that too, and if interested, I can get you started on how to make it happen. To read the original PAL report explaining how strength training guidelines were developed for breast cancer survivors who have lymphedema: http://www.lymphnet.org/pdfDocs/PAL_NEJM.pdf . Then there is the PAL-Trial evaluation of weight-lifting risks to women at risk of lymphedema,  available at: jama.ama-assn.org/content/earl... Lead researcher Kathryn Schmitz wrote an article clarifying misconceptions about the PAL Trial results, which were poorly reported in the media when the study was released: http://www.lymphnet.org/pdfDocs/Weight_LE_Misconception.pdf The Livestrong program is great, definitely designed for cancer survivors, but their trainers get only a little background in the PAL guidelines.  So at minimum, I hope you'll read the resources I linked here, so you'll know what to ask about and when to object if an unwitting trainer suggests a move that's not really good for you. Do lift...but do lift intelligently!  40% of us will get LE after BC treatment, and the risk is particularly high during the 3 years post-treatment.  Some lucky women in the 60% club can lift, push, pull, do pushups and yank on resistance bands and never get LE.  No one knows why some get it, some don't.  You cannot know if you're in the 40% or the 60%, but being careful to do smart weightlifting could help nudge you away from the group that gets this crazy condition. Nibbana, good luck, especially getting your therapist to understand that there's more to fitness than cardio, and 'more' can be not only safe, but highly useful to those of us with LE. Carol",

Yesterday's cleaning got me 11,000+ steps and lots of full-body movement from wiping, mopping... This is funny, in a way: I had my daughter measure my arm for the purpose of online purchasing of the inexpensive Allegro sleeve/gauntlet combo, with the goal of buying three of them to have on hand during the coming kayak/camping week. Unfortunately, it looks like that sleeve is not going to work, because my measurement in the armpit/ bicep area suggests 'large' and all the other measures say 'small.'  Why?  Weight lifting! The area from shoulder down through the bicep is much bigger than it used to be -- same is true for the non-LE arm--and it's clearly muscle!  I still have the LE aches and do get puffier from time to time, but always in the chicken-flap area hanging down is such ugly fashion directly below that lovely muscle.  So: good news is that I'm apparently getting stronger.  Bad news is that it's put my arm parts out of proportion, at least according to this particular sleeve maker.  The measure ranges for the Jobst ready-to-wear that I already have are still valid, so I ordered one set of the crazy expensive Jobst items, and I did order a medium in the Allegro, just to see how it feels.  I suspect it won't give adequate compression from the elbow down, but Brightlife assures me I can return it even after trying it for a while. I am a tiny bit worried about days of paddling and what it will do to my LE arm, but the river is slow-moving and we will be going with the current, so not difficult paddling. And I am much encouraged by the strength I've been gaining in the gym.  My theory all along has been that weightlifting develops strength that enables the arm to do more and work harder before the lymphatic system perceives overload and sends out the lymph troops. As you know, I've been following the PAL protocol and working with a trainer to keep me out of trouble, and (knock wood) so far, I have never had an LE flare post-workout.  I do get muscle tenderness in both arms, but now I know the difference in feel between LE ache and muscle ache.  Today I have some LE ache, which I think is because yesterday's scrub-fest recruited lots of arm motion in places I don't necessarily work as hard in the gym, and for sure it was the dreaded repetitive motion.  In any case, I am so glad I learned about the PAL program early on, before getting myself into trouble, and that I was able to find help to supervise my workouts. Otherwise, I suspect that yesterday's cleaning would have bitten me like a bug. Final funny thing to report on this topic:  My LE arm (lefty) is stronger than my non-LE arm, and I am right-handed, so normally the opposite would be true.  I think so, and my trainer says he is positive, based on watching me lift dumbbells in each hand.  So we're calling my sleeve the 'power sleeve.'  Apparently it has magical strength-building properties, at least in my case! Good luck to all for some relatively cool exercise today. Carol",

I'm not the expert, so I'll give you some food for thought and reassure you that one of our several really knowledgeable LE friends will come by soon to give you more substance. I suspect one of our wonderful LE experts will suggest the best way to get the answer that's right for YOU is to have a consultation with a certified LE therapist.  I wonder if that popping vein is a cord -- axillary web syndrome --and that's all the more reason to have a consult with a therapist, who can tell for sure and if so, help with that.  Armpit pain going away when you wear the sleeve and glove: terrific, and it sure tells you that wearing compression puts you on the right track.  But to know how often and how long to wear it, is a function of where you are in LE and in LE control.  I'm wondering if anyone gave you therapeutic exercises to do, and went over all the precautions (like bug repellent and gloves while gardening) to ward off evil LE spirits. You want to be careful to protect yourself from infection that could start with just a scratch or a bite, given the loss of so many nodes. As to sleeve/glove replacement, I think they have about a 6-month life when worn daily but switching off with another set.  I wear mine generally only for heavy work, weight lifting in the gym, and to fly, but my LE is (knock wood) mild and so far, pretty easy to control if I take care to exercise and do manual lymphatic drainage daily.  So I get some extra mileage out of my sleeve and gauntlet. Hello, all the rest of you!  PTdreamers got busy, where are the rest of us?  I will freely admit that my office got the best of me today, after Round Two of company (one of my very best friends and her DH) left this morning.  Zero exercise as I tried to catch up on work missed these past two weeks while we ran a B&B for family and friends (and loved every minute of it).  Tomorrow I do a day trip to see my PS for a quick consult, but it will be six hours round trip plus the consult time, so bah and my exercise will be a city walk from train station to medical building.   Yesterday I did do a 3-hour trial-run kayak trip with DH and friends, in full compression, to see how that would treat me.  Today I feel pretty good, just a tiny bit of LE ache and a tiny bit of visible swelling.  Actually yesterday I got 11,000 steps in and went to the gym, so I think I'll just average yesterday and today. I hope everyone else is busy having fun, and that you're getting some exercise in while you're at it!  Carol",

I didn't find that hard at all, and I wasn't going for any speed.  Despite all of that, yes, it's easy to succumb to doing too much, when we have all the right reasons for doing what we want to do and what we think we should do. Today I've been marveling at MLD and how it really does work.  Joe Zuther's Lymphedema Blog had a nice article about the science of MLD a while back, and I think I'm going to find that article and re-read it.  I saw a study once that concluded that MLD is one of the less substantiated elements of complete decongestive therapy, but I really do wonder about that.

Of course Medicare denies it, but in the appeals process, which goes four or five levels and can take several years, you make the case that the garment is a prosthetic device, replacing all or part of the function of a permanently inoperable or malfunctioning internal body organ (lymphatic system). Unfortunately, one has to go through this process with every garment purchase, and he is aware of patients who have had four or more appeals going at one time. The appeals can be combined if there are several reaching the final appeal level at the same time. He showed a pretty good batting average of convincing the fourth-level appeal judge that garments are indeed reimbursable prosthethic devices.  The fifth level of appeal is outside the Medicare review system, i.e. in a court of law.  Mr. Weiss explained that the first four levels of appeal have no cost to them--it's a matter of filing papers and knowing how to fill them in appropriately, and paying for postage.  But the fifth level is very expensive and the cost to appeal there would be greater than the value of the claim. Bob Weiss is indeed a good friend to the lymphedema community, and he encourages everyone to go the appeal route, so precedent can be established and a large number of cases can draw attention to the problem.

Heavy liting without a sleeve and any weight lifting program before your LE is stable is not a good idea, and when it is, there are guidelines to follow to do it safely. For now, heavy-duty cardio work might also make your LE worse, so watch for aggressive arm pumping and try not to get your heart pumping so much that you raise core body temp super high, before your LE appointment and advice that's customized to you.  But in the meantime, do get moving, lightly, and usually that means a nice brisk walk or whatever you like to do that doesn't get you all worked up into a complete lather.  Lots of us count simple steps, using a pedometer, and we don't have to be world class athletes competing in a speed-walk competition.  Be sure to report in here, and tell us what kind of activity you're doing each day! Yesterday I had a pretty good exercise day, as I went to the gym to lift weights.  I had missed two full weeks while traveling, so boo...had to back down the weights by 20% for the arm and other upper body work. Even so, it felt great, and I also did 30 treadmill minutes.  Today--let myself be more glued to my desk, so the report is well...miserable.  Considering I never missed a day of 10,000+ steps while at the NLN, I guess it means I need Becky around to keep me motivated!  Tomorrow I'll restart the walking engine for sure.",

Becky and I were talking about that last week, and she is an expert on weight loss and how hard it can be.  I am now 30 lbs down, since 18 months ago, and about three months ago, that effort had really stalled.  No matter how much or how little I exercised or ate, the scale would not budge for six weeks.  Then I got a fitbit, which measures activity and does a great job of estimating calories burned, and it interfaces with an online food diary, which sounds like what some of you are doing.  That did the trick--walking by my computer syncs the fitbit with the online program, so I just watch what it tells me about calories in vs. calories out--if I'm close to the in/out balance needed to lose 1 lb per week, I know I have to get some activity in if I'm going to eat more and still stick to the weight loss plan.  When I travel I don't worry about the food diary part as much, but I make double sure that I'm exercising. And after recording food to the ounce for several months, I find I have a pretty good sense of what I should/can eat now, anyway.  Fitbit is expensive, but I'm pretty sure that just recording food and using a pedometer works to master the weight-loss beast.  If I'm honest with myself, I know that just a good old food diary with calorie counts would do much of what the pricey fitbit helps me with.  I will say that it's a lot easier to track calories using the online programs, than in the old days when you looked calories up in a book and got out your calculator!  What are the names of more online fitness and calorie trackers everyone is using?  That information might help some others here.  Many are free, I know. Back to reporting in here--yesterday I managed only 7,200 steps, so missed my 10,000 goal, but I did work out in the gym, lifting weights for an hour, so I think I got my calorie burn!  Today is a beeeeuuuutiful day here in west Michigan, so I hope to find some time for an outdoor walk.

When I organized a PAL workshop for trainers and LE therapists here, two area hospitals, both of which have affiliated fitness centers, sent both an LE therapist and a personal trainer. Their idea was to be able to work in partnership with LE patients and BC survivors, which is a wonderful idea. On the more frustrating side, I tried to convince the Y in the largest area city to send one or more trainers to the workshop, but after discussing it, some committee or other decided they would not participate, because their strategic direction for community outreach was diabetes help last year, and heart disease this year, so no room for LE!  I was crushed, tried to convince them that they most certainly have BC survivors working out in their facilities, and that neither the Y staff nor probably most of the BC survivors knows about LE risk.  They would not budge.   And then there was the Y at another large city nearby, which sent their program director, who is also a certified personal trainer. She was great, telling me that they had not been able to participate in the LiveStrong cancer survivor program, for budget reasons, so they designed their own program, a combination cardio, flexibility, and strength training program, for all cancer survivors.  After her day in our workshop, she said that she would be making changes to the program, because neither she nor the two trainers who had helped her develop the program had any clue about the LE risks they were inadvertently subjecting their clients to.   These three stories are quite different, but they are all testimony to just how little is known about LE in the fitness and even in the cancer-center world.  And too many BC survivors are unaware, which is a big reason there is not a groundswell of demand from patients and gym members to request programs like PAL workshops. Which brings me back to my motto on all things related to LE education:  tag, we're it!  If we don't speak up and demand information, and in this case programs, our care providers and our gym owners are not going to know of our needs and they won't spend a dime to meet them. Proudtospin, I send you bucketloads of encouragement for when you start talking to the folks at the new fitness center!  I have lots of documents explaining the what and why for a gym to learn about PAL and incorporate it in their member programs, so just PM me if you would like those resources.

So, that's a dilemma.  In the Philadelphia area, it's possible to sign up for a group program run by the UPenn folks, and many LE therapists are comfortable designing strength training routines that comply with the PAL guidelines. The idea is to start out with very light weights (just one measly pound) and move the weights up very slowly, and in very small increments.  No bodyweight moves (no pushups, no planks) and no resistance bands.  If you can work with a personal trainer even once or twice, a good trainer will be able to give you a basic strength training program and show you good form while doing it.   My routine includes a chest press, bicep curls, bent-over row, and triceps kick-back for the torso and arms.  I also hold weights in my hands while doing calf raises, squats, lunges and step-ups.  Form is so important for all of these--for example, we do not want to let the knee extend beyond the toes in a lunge, to make sure we protect the knee. Above all, add weight intelligently (slow and small), and if you miss more than one session (shooting for 2x per week), reduce the weights to the amount you were lifting in the last full lifting week.  Monitor your LE, and if you have any kind of flare within a day of a workout, stop the strength training and check in with your LE therapist for guidance.. And...warm up doing 5-10 minutes of moderate cardio before lifting weights, and then stretch all these muscles when you finish your weight lifting. I wish we all had access to the UPenn group sessions, or that we could all bring Cathy Bryan (who was one of the PAL research team members) to our areas, to train the local trainers. Her workshop really is wonderful. I asked for and received financial help from several area hospitals to bring her to w. Michigan. Anyone who is ambitious enough to organize such a workshop in your town, PM me and I'll give you lots of details and help. Carol",

There's a lot of knee lifting, high kicking and arm pumping--but you can either ignore those and just keep stepping in place, with no arms, or you can keep these movements very small.  That way, you begin doing what is essentially just a walk, but to a certain pace to get your heartrate up, but you don't over do it.  As you get stronger and feel more confident, and as you continue to heal, you can begin to take bigger and higher steps, do the knees and kicks, etc.  Oh--and why not place a call to your surgeon's office to ask about green light for some cardio? Ohio..I think you snuck in there that it is your birthday!!!  Maybe yesterday?  Not older, my friend, but better!!  Glad to hear that all is well. Dawne-Hope, Brightlife will take a garment back even if you've worn it, for up to a month or six weeks (I can't recall exactly).  So, you might experiment with some other sleeve, and if it doesn't work, send it back. They handle Lymphedivas, too.  Or, have you investigated, to see if there is a durable medical equipment (DME) provider in your area, that might measure you independent of any order from a therapist?  That's what I did recently.  I bought two sleeves/gauntlets and a night garment from them (with insurance help, thank goodness), so it was worth their while, but they were more than willing to work with me without a therapist in the picture.  I do have a therapist, but she really does not have much to offer me to help with my stage 0 LE--no visible swelling, and I know the MLD routine by now, so it feels to me like our meetings are 'talk therapy' and I prefer to spend my deductible / co-pay elsewhere. Plus, she does not measure for garments.  It was time recently to replace my sleeves, and I learned from BeckySharp of a DME a few hours from me that specialized in LE garments, and who works with therapists all over the country.  It was worth driving to have them measure me, and they also deal with more sleeve brands than the first, local DME I went to. In the end, I have a better fitting sleeve than my old ones.  So, all of this to say, can you explore garment dealers in your area, even if it means driving a bit, to find one willing to work with you directly? You might need your MD to fill out a form.  You  might have to pay more than using a mail order vendor, but if you find a sleeve that fits well, you can always get replacements, as you need them, from a mail order source. And I'll second Purple's applause for Josh at LympheDivas!  He has helped me with a couple of advocacy projects.  And, when I ordered a sleeve, he took the time to review my measures, to make sure I got the proper size.  And...they sell seconds on their website (design printing errors; the garments are fine), if budgets are tight. Now, back to exercise--yesterday by the time I went to bed, I was amazed to see that I had logged almost 7 miles!  I did early-morning exercise and went to the gym, but I guess I was also just a busy beaver walking about the house all afternoon and evening, to get so many steps in.  It was a pleasant discovery when I put the fitbit to bed for the night!",

I have managed a few short bursts of exercise, taking the dog out for a jog, but it has been quite cold, so these were pretty brief. DH and I started our drive home at 5:30 this morning, to get out of northern Ohio before today's blizzard arrives. As we drive, I have been puzzling over why my LE arm is so incredibly achey, and it just dawned on me that it is the barometric pressure change at work. And sure enough, DH tells me he now has a sinus headache, which always happens as storms approach. So we may dodge most of the snowy driving, but not the storm's other wrath. As for exercise today, I can get it in once at home today, but now I have to think twice, since the arm is already barking at me. How frustrating!",

So I contacted a very well known LE/exercise researcher to ask about it, and her private response to me was to agree that non-measurable resistance is not a good idea when beginning to incorporate resistance training in an exercise program...it's something to be worked up to, using known weights and the slowly progressive method espoused in the PAL protocol.  This researcher was not willing to raise a fuss with the NLN, so the poor advice (IMHO) about non-measurable resistance training remains in the NLN exercise position paper.

Today, I walked. And walked. And walked.  DH and I did an 8-mile walk starting late morning (he's telling his friends I made him walk 8 miles for a beer!). After lunch, we kept at it, with a few rest periods and time out for a cuppa joe. And more after dinner. Total for the day: 30,478 steps, which my fitbit tells me equals 13.5 miles, and I also climbed 33 flights of stairs during the day.  Except the first 8 miles, no speed records, but simply delightful outdoor walking in a beautiful place.  I have done all the stretches in my playbook three times today, including a round of Lebeds, and now: bedtime!

There should not be a wrinkle in the sleeve anywhere, so try using the palm of your other hand to smooth things out. Some use a rubber glove to help get traction for that. As Musical said, there are donning aids. Look on the bandages plus website for that. (I think--I am writing on my phone so no easy way to check and insert links). The dot marks from the grip studs do last a while. My sleeve is juzo and the marks stay for 30-40 minutes I'd guess.  Maybe someone can insert a link to the stepup site's page on how to know if a garment fits, which includes photos.  The gauntlet has a hard time hugging the palm of the hand because if you look closely, your palm is not flat. You could try inserting a piece of firm foam cut to sit inside the cup of your palm, although I don't know how well it would stay put. Maybe someone here has tried that and will comment.  I think you will find that donning gets easier over time and that you will get used to the feel of compression. But everyone here knows exactly how you are feeling about the frustration that comes with LE, including the garment challenges. ",

Remember when I posted about writing a what-we-want-our-trainers-to-know handout, to be put on the stepup-speakout website, for download?  Well, I had some wonderful people here raise their hands to help out, including some great posts on suggestions for fitness instructors, and one of our members here is a Pilates instructor, and she wrote a great section on that. In addition, the wonderful doctor and LE researcher Dr. Andrea Cheville has reviewed what's currently in the document, because she did some Pilates/LE research and we wanted to see if she would weigh in and endorse our suggestions. She's a great supporter of exercise when done intelligently--which is what Purple is working toward, too. I'm about on draft #4, with a yoga section yet to come.  I hope it will be finished by the end of February, and then it will be on the Su-So site soon after.  So, Purple--I wish I had this ready now, but it should not be too long from now.  It explains LE and its causes and then suggests precautions by different exercise type.  Everything is related back to the research available, which is most available for weight lifting, but from which we can extend common sense guidelines to other types of exercise. The idea is for women with breast cancer related LE, and those not diagnosed but at risk for BCRL, to download and print the handout, and to give it to our trainers and exercise, Pilates, yoga etc. instructors.  It sounds like a few LiveStrong trainers would be great candidates for someone handing this over to them! Oh, and today: 5.5 miles of spectacular outdoor walking, with a stroller loaded with two little ones, but one of my best friends came drove several hours to spend the day with me in my grandma role, and SHE pushed the stroller!  And I hereby commit to doing Lebed before bed!

But as you were so kind to remind us, overdoing it with too much effort or a type of exercise that we cannot handle invites an overload of lymph.  So blow-out cardio may not work for me, but both Nibbana and I have been very fortunate to be able to use resistance training to advantage. It has been great in this forum to hear about all the different ways that everyone is exercising, be!cause it's a reminder that there really are lots of choices",

So why not watch the TV on my feet, walking?  I made lots of small loops (can see TV from three rooms) but surprisingly, it was neither boring nor tiresome. I was not moving very fast, but any movement helps.  (I'm sure my dog thinks I'm weird to be walking in circles.) This morning I did 4.5 miles of alternating miles of elliptical and jogging.

Who else besides Debra Cordner Carson is an athlete with LE? (She's amazing) A few months ago, I switched from coffee during the day to green tea. I still start the morning with a cup of coffee, but no more second, third, and fourth cups (I guess I really grew to need the stuff). Instead, I brew a batch of leaves and add more hot water to it a few times, plus some fresh leaves once during the day.  So, my hope is that I'm amping up the antioxidants with a lot less caffeine than the coffee. I actually like the green tea taste just fine, but I LOVE it when I drop a chopped up chunk of fresh ginger in the cup along with a tiny wedge of lemon. I sip on this brew all day, and I think--just think--that it reduces my arm ache. Often I realize that after an hour or so of drinking the tea, I feel better.  Or...is it just that I've been moving a bit and activity is helping?  I don't know, but I'm happy with the green tea so I shall continue. Today I did some indoor house laps + gym treadmill to get 6 miles in before dinner. While at the gym, I did weights, ab and flexibility with the trainer. At the gym, it was also time to do some LE-strength training problem solving. I've been bench-pressing with two, 20-lb dumbbells for more than a month now, so we worked out a plan to work toward using 25-pounds weights. That takes some thinking, because we don't want to add five pounds per arm all at once, and the gym dumbbells go up in 5-lb increments. So I will be carrying my Powerblocks to the gym for a while, because I can set them to 21 lbs each. After a few weeks at 21 lbs per arm, we'll increase the reps to 15 and then 18, and slow the movements down to build more strength for a few more weeks, headed toward 24 lbs, the next 'notch' on the Powerblocks.  I feel very fortunate that I have someone at the gym I trust, who can watch my form and help me do this safely. Sometimes the luggage I travel with is pretty heavy. I sure can't move it with the same safe form as weights in the gym, so my theory is that I'm better off if I can easily handle very heavy loads, so if I pick up a bag un-ergonomically, I'm less likely to tempt LE fate. I'm writing all this out because I want to share my reminder that we need to be very, very careful about how we build strength, whether working with 2 lbs or 20. I know I'm lifting a lot, and I need to, to prepare for my work travel. Good thing I really like doing it (and I think Nibbana is there, too!). My LE is quite stable, so I've been lucky to be able to push the weights, which I know isn't possible for everyone. We sure are all different in how our LE challenges us.",

A little bird told me that you'd mentioned my name, and while I don't stop by BCO much these days, I'll be ever, ever grateful for your friendship and that of so many other amazing women in the LE forum and elsewhere in BCO. My LE is --dare I say this--pretty tame anymore.

So, I'm feeling quite fortunate, and I don't need as much girl support as I once did. I'm still in the gym twice or thrice per week doing the weight lifting, still working often with a wonderful trainer who hosted a PAL workshop a few years ago, presented to area personal trainers, LE therapists, and a group of OTs and PTs. The presenter was Cathy Bryan, who was the lead trainer during the original PAL trials, and she was wonderful. If anyone seeing this would like to be put in touch with Cathy, do PM me. I believe she's still taking her program on the road. I tend to believe that all the years of consistent strength training have played a big part in taming my LE, but I also know that there's a certain amount of just plain luck of the draw. I hope everyone's finding ways to exercise that help the swelling, wearing the @#!@ sleeves even when pumping up heart rates in hot weather...and feeling you're doing what you can to move the LE needle in your favor.

I've not reported my exercise in a while.  Went to the gym yesterday for my regular cardio/strength/flex work with the trainer, and otherwise in the past few days have just tried to get the steps and miles in, with no particular timeouts for pure cardio.  Sunday was spring cleanup in our many (too many) gardens, and I raked a lot, and my arm is paying the price.  It's so hard to set limits when there's a job to be done and it's sunny and beautiful outside!

But we come back, and over the long run, despite sometimes feeling it's two exercise steps forward, and a half LE-penalty step backward, we make great progress. I'm a kayaker and looking forward to a week of 6-10 hour paddling days on a river next month. In my sleeve and gauntlet, of course! Have you bumped into the step-up, speak out exercise-with-LE guidelines?  Here are two links, the first for any trainer or fitness or yoga instructor you may be working with, and the second is for anyone who has or is at risk of LE. http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Trainer%20doc%20for%20SUSO-040113.pdf http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Handout%20doc%20for%20SUSO-040113.pdf I'll look forward to reading your updates on exercise that you're getting; and we should also remember that Tina337 started this thread so we could report our LE care right alongside our exercise. I'm still babying my butt. Dawne-Hope, I do plan to be back to my normal weight lifting routine on Thursday, with a trainer appointment. I'll be modifying or skipping some lower body work, but you can bet I'll be doing my arm work.  Paddling is right around the corner! My recent LE care: hydration, hydration, hydration and deep breathing. Not enough, I know.  I haven't done MLD for a while; I'm experimenting and truthfully, I no longer see much difference if I do it or if I do not. My arm does not swell much, just burns like heck and aches like crazy when it flares, and I find that since starting to wear a Tribute night garment, the garment does a nice job of bringing those symptoms down for me. So I do the deep breathing and stretching before bed, just before putting my Tribute on.  Glad to know MLD, which I did for a long time, in case I need it.",

Even with very light weights, that's a lot of repetitions, and your swelling is telling you that you've got too much going on at the moment. Compression is a good idea--I wear UnderArmour compression T shirts, so the armpit is compressed and the T shirt's sleeve comes all the way to my medical compression sleeve (men's sizes work better than women's, because their women's T shirts have cap sleeves that cut into the armpit). But even in compression, you probably need to reduce the stress until you can get the swelling and tenderness down, ideally gone. Can you experiment to see what happens if you use zero weight, but perform the lifting motions (i.e., the repetitions without the weight)? Or opposite--stay with very  light weights but reduce reps to just 5 or 6?  The best approach would be to stop lifting entirely until you have the LE under control, but I wouldn't want to hear that advice myself, so I understand if it's not what you want to hear. Paddling is sort of the ultimate combination of repetitive motion and working against resistance. I put my pedometer on my kayak paddle recently, to see  how many 'steps' it would measure in a day of paddling.  In a typical 6-hour paddling day that covered 9-14 river miles, I was clocking between 19,000 and 24,000 paddle lifts, of unknown equivalence to weights when lifting.  My LE arm became very, very tired, and toward the end of one day I stopped paddling except for steering, letting the river current do all the work, because my LE arm was exhausted. But I did not have a swelling flare, and I chalk that up to several years of weight lifting, following the PAL protocol for slowly progressive resistance, to the letter.   So I'd say be careful about getting ahead of what your LE can handle.  (Easier said than done...I totally get that!).

They are walk-at-home exercise routines that have you walking in place, and taking just a few steps forward, backward, side to side, etc., with kicks and knee raises to help pump up the heart rate. To me, the great beauty of these videos is that you can tailor them to wherever you are in fitness and energy. I used them after my diep recon to get moving again, initially keeping the steps small and avoiding the knee raises, which would have been too challenging for the abdominal healing going on. Some of the videos are broken into separate 1-mile segments, so you can feel that you've completed something even if you can only handle fifteen or twenty minutes at a time. The only caution I pass along with these videos is that some of them have you using a resistance band, and that's generally not a great idea for those of us with LE. I do Leslie videos pretty often, these days using some that are more of a jogging pace than a walking pace. You need hardly any space to do it in, and weather does not matter! For protein, depending on what you like to eat, have you considered Greek yogurt? 28 grams of protein in one 8-oz serving!  I'm picky about what goes into my milk, so I make my own yogurt and then strain it to make it 'greek.'  That takes time, but it cuts the cost of organic yogurt from pastured cows.  I sure do agree with proudtospin about exercise chasing away the blues! I go to a gym and sometimes I have to kick my butt hard to put down my work and go. I'm often pretty cranky over work deadlines. But I come back in a great mood and ready for more of the darned work.  I'm sure my DH blesses every gym trip I make, so I don't feel the need to dump my work problems on him!",

I'm happy walking too, and I find that a speedy walk gives me the ability to see and appreciate my surroundings more than when I do some jogging, probably because I'm so focused on how hard the light running is, that I can't think of anything else!  But I want to develop some more endurance for challenging activities like walking the 90 steps up from the water by our house, and I think harder cardio is the answer. The outdoor steps are good, but the trip down is rought on the knees, so I don't want to do it over and over and over.  I can set the resistance high on an elliptical machine, or increase the grade on a treadmill, but I feel like such a gerbil on those dang machines!  So-thought I'd try some light jogging. I would LOVE to be on a team like yours, training together for a shared goal. I'm really a Buckeye (moved to MI 10 years ago, which is not long enough to change my stripes!) and if I still lived in Ohio, I might just be looking to form a team and give yours a little competition!

It doesn't mean you have to have no swelling, just that it's pretty consistent.  Other guidelines for exercise can be summed as slow-and-steady progression.  Your 'all out' approach might have made things worse. It's best to start conservatively and add intensity gradually, especially if you do resistance/strength/weight training.  One reason for the slow/steady progression guideline is easy to understand. When we have muscle soreness, that's a sign of inflammation, which invites the body to send lymph to the rescue. So the mantra of 'no pain no gain' is a bad approach for us, unless you want 'gain' to mean added arm girth.  To minimize post exercise soreness (which the trainers refer to as DOMS, delayed onset muscle soreness), you want to avoid pushing your muscles to the point of failure. That's usually exactly what we do when we lift weights--use a combination of reps and weights that will make the last few reps in a set incredibly hard to complete. Strength training, which includes using resistance on an elliptical, has the goal of breaking down muscle fibers, which prompts the muscle to grow back bigger and stronger. That breaking-down is what is causing inflammation and muscle soreness.  So can you see why aggressive lower-body workouts can prompt the release of lymph into your lymphatic system? Strategies to prevent DOMS include staying well hydrated and being sure to stretch after your workouts. My trainer also swears that it helps if you eat a small meal with a good balance of protein and carbohydrates within a half hour of finishing your workout. He also says that if you're lifting weights, it's helpful to follow the resistance training with some cardio work. Today, I am too well acquainted with all of the above, because yesterday's 15 miles of walking, which included lots of stairs --about 33 staircases worth--made my arm incredibly sore on waking up this morning! I did not use my arms at all, other than the normal bit of movement while walking, but ouch.  I support my arm when walking, too, by putting my hand in a pocket, so the arm truly did not take any abuse. Usually any day-to-day swelling or soreness goes away during the night, because I get great results from my night garment, but this morning, ick. So it must have been all the lower-body exertion that did it (and my legs were a bit sore when I woke up, adding further evidence to why my arm is sore). On your question of whether exercise can improve your LE, I think that's not been proven, although unfortunately a few years ago the news media misinterpreted one particular study and reported widely and erroneously that weight lifting could improve or prevent it.  Here's a link to comments about the best study on weightlifting with LE, in which the study's principal researcher discusses that very question: http://stepup-speakout.org/Weightlifting%20and%20... The bottom line seems to be that exercise can be safe for us, but it's not proven to improve or prevent LE. Also, in case you've not seen it, here's a document that you might share with your PT, explaining the LE exercise guidelines. It includes references to some relevant studies: http://stepup-speakout.org/Trainer%20doc%20for%20S... I started exercising as soon as my PS gave me the green light, and by that time, I already had the LE diagnosis.  I was able to work with some local hospitals and companies to sponsor a full-day workshop by an expert in exercising with LE, which a group of local gym trainers and LE therapists attended, including the owner of the gym where I work out. So I'm very lucky that I have a resource that understands how I need to moderate my exercise progression.  That was about two years ago, and now I exercise all that I want (but probably less than I need to...) and I'm lifting some pretty heavy weights.  I'm an avid kayaker, and I'm now back to being able to paddle for 8 or 9 hours.  Last summer I stuck a pedometer on my paddle and it registered on average, 19,000 paddle strokes per day for 6 days I spent on a river trip, against water resistance. The strength I'd built up in the gym is what I believe allowed me to do that without triggering any LE flares.  My arm was bone tired by the end of each day, while my non-LE arm didn't even notice the work, but I didn't swell up and I'm giving full credit to my exercise program for that.   So, the long answer to your question is that yes, you can exercise, but it's probably going to make you dig deep into your reservoir of patience to get where you want to be! Hang in there, and don't give up your vision of returning to exercise. You can, and you will. Slowly and surely. Carol",

      "Content": "Jan 24, 2014 06:11AM carol57 wrote: mnmbeck, there's no 'one' criterion for a lymphedema diagnosis.  Here's a short discussion of that from a course for nurses: Diagnosing BCRL: edema After breast cancer treatment, lymphedema is suspected when there is visible arm swelling. Typically BCRL is confirmed by comparing the limb against a non-affected arm. Comparing a suspected-BCRL arm with an unaffected arm is problematic for bilateral patients, or when the suspected arm is the patient\u2019s dominant arm. In patients without BCRL, the dominant arm can have a circumference up to 2 cm greater, and a volume as much as 8-9% greater than the non-dominant arm. Pre-surgical/pre-radiation baseline arm measures remove this confusion. Measurement criteria currently used to make a BCRL diagnosis vary widely and include: An \u2018increase\u2019 may reflect a comparison to a non-affected arm, or to a prior, same-arm measurement. Measures are most often taken using a non-stretching tape measure, measuring at four or five anatomical landmarks from shoulder to hand. Measures are then converted to limb volume, using charts or computer software. Other measurement devices include water displacement, infrared perometry, and bioelectrical impedance The International Society of Lymphology (ISL) also recognizes Stage (or Grade) 0 lymphedema: Stage 0: A latent or subclinical condition where swelling is not evident despite impaired lymph transport. Stage 0 may exist months or years before edema becomes evident. Keep in mind that patients often report sensations of heaviness, fullness, numbness, achiness and tingling that are demonstrated to accurately predict onset of BCRL. In addition Stout (2008) suggested that treating subclinical BCRL (limb volume increases of as little as 3%) with compression may prevent BCRL from advancing to more severe stages. I did see one study that was well designed that found that post-surgical swelling often does resolve and not progress to chronic lymphedema during the first year, particularly if the patient had received taxane-based chemotherapy, which the authors identified as a common cause of swelling. Interestingly, that same study found that those who exercised were more likely to see their post-surgical swelling reverse during that first year (it was a study of exercise vs. no exercise and the effect on LE risk during the first year after surgery). The exercise in question was cautious and conservative, similar to what your CLT is having you do.   Exercise can help reduce swelling from injury and is suspected (not proven) to help improve LE and/or reduce risk of getting LE, because our muscles provide pumping action to the lymphatic capillaries to enhance movement of the lymph within. That's one reason you'll often see advice to elevate your arm while pumping your fist--to engage the muscles.  It's also one reason that compression sleeves help us--they provide a firm surface against which our muscles can push, to increase the pump effect on the lymphatic vessels. So gentle exercise has a direct impact on lymph drainage, although if we over-do it, we can invite more lymph to 'the rescue' by creating a rise of core body heat, the possibility of a high weight load that triggers inflammation, or excess repetitive motion that causes fatigue to the point of pain or stress that in turn draws lymph.   You WILL return to your former fit self!  As you said, the path to getting there is not going to be what you would have done prior to the whole BC business.  Kettlebells...well, keep an eye on them for inspiration, but you need to work up to those weights, and I've seen people put a lot of big motions into using them, which makes me think that there's a lot more resistance being applied to the arms than just the amount they weigh.  If you ever feel like jumping on the LE advocacy bandwagon, there's an amazing woman in Delaware who can bring an exercise-with-lymphedema workshop to your city, designed for personal trainers and LE therapists.  I brought her to my area for a day, with some financial help for her travel expenses from two hospitals and a local company. We charged a nominal amount for the workshop, which the participants' clinics and fitness centers were happy to pay, to cover the instructor's fee.  It was a wonderful workshop (I observed all day).  My own trainer participated and that has meant that our weight lifting work together for the past year and a half has been exactly what I need, and I've been able to progress pretty quickly. You can find her here: http://cancersurvivorfitness.com/ .  It was a lot of work to organize what was needed to bring the workshop to my little town, but well worth the effort.  One great outcome was that several LE clinics that sent therapists are affiliated with fitness centers at hospitals, and they sent personal trainers. So there are some nice pairings of LE therapists and personal trainers who speak the same weight-training language and can work together for their patients'/clients' benefit. It's easy to get discouraged, but hang in there. Carol",

Another diagnostic tool is bio electric impedence, which sends a tiny current through your flesh and measures the amount of resistance against the current. Liquid resists differently than fat or muscle. It has problems because it cannot distinguish reasons for added liquid, but this tool is relatively inexpensive and it's owners are great marketers, so it's becoming a more common diagnostic tool.   A perometer picked up added volume on my arm that I was not aware of when I went for evaluation of my truncal LE and they measured my arms, too.

DH is going to relocate the pathway and I volunteered to remove the old one and do the stacking. They were in sand, so not hard to remove, but gee this was repetitive, and I took them only about 20 feet, so it was a lot of short back-and forth, two bricks at a time.  Then I removed about 40 slender dogwoods from a wooded area in our yard that is loaded with native dogwoods that we regrettably ignored for the last few years.  It was overgrown, and the trees leggy, and we needed to thin it out --so that was my afternoon project.  DH did the hauling away of my considerable pile of tree debris.  It was a glorious day, and the temperature was perfect, so I enjoyed the whole process.  Until when I came in to undress and stuff my clothes in the washer and hit the shower--two spiders dropped to the floor with my clothing.  Ick! But no bites that I can tell.  From fear of ticks, I was covered all but my face and clothes were well sprayed with bug repellent and I had sunscreen on my face, so by rights I should not have had any bites! I'm pooped, ladies, but happy to have accomplished something and enjoyed doing so outdoors.  And very glad that I've been doing PAL-compliant weight lifting for almost three years, or I would never have dreamed of doing all that repetitive brick-moving. That's my LE-kick-butt news of the day!",

As to whether to include others besides BE-related LE, certainly no philosophical objection, but I do think that the narrower the scope, the simpler and more likely successful a program that meets the needs of all the attendees.  First time to do something like this--keep it simple if possible.

Lots of places around me are selling their bedraggled looking perennials at rock-bottom prices now.  So long as they're alive, I don't care what they look like, and in Spring we'll never know they were on the sad side when they were planted.  I plan to do more of same today. We put in a new driveway, made it wider and added some curves, so a month ago I had to dig up plants to save them, put them in temporarily elsewhere, and now it's time to redo the plantings along the new driveway. That's got me interested in moving all kinds of things around, taking a good look at what's been thriving and what probably needs a different kind of light.  I will say that this kind of exercise makes you realize how much in the limber department gets sacrificed with age! I have the strength, but yikes, the bending and stretching and getting up and down....not so much!",

In any case, I'm glad you could get back out there today.   The ortho surgeon got me into a sturdy brace to help with exercise, and I'm going to try a series of synvisc injections. This is all about picking which poison I want to deal with...inactivity and likely overweight, or dealing with repeat injections that may or may not help, and which I sure do hope live up to their reputation as having no serious side effects.  Getting older sure does come with some asterisks. Rosie, today I thought of a study I read some time ago, but I cannot for the life of me find it again.  The study had half of a BC-patient group exercise after treatment that included node dissection, and the other half did not.  I think the exercise was cardio stuff.  As I recall, the exercisers had a much lower incidence of LE by the end of a year.  The trouble with the study was I think not following up longer than that; also the study authors were maintaining that a lot of the swelling they saw in the first year was not LE, but rather post-surgical swelling, and I don't think they did anything to intervene, i.e. treat it as LE.  I believe their conclusions were that women who exercise are less likely to have their post-surgical swelling turn into 'real' LE.  One of the lead researchers was Sandra Hayes, who is affiliated with an Australian university and who does a lot of LE-related research, especially concerning exercise.   Other LE researchers, including Jane Armer, believe that early swelling is quite likely to signal likely LE and should be followed and treated as appropriate. You might google Sandi Hayes' work and see what you can find. In my search for this particular study, I bumped into a list of her in-process research, and one of them aims to find out if wearing compression during exercise really has any protective benefit for us.  I'm glad she's doing that study and hope it's well designed and thus credible, whatever the outcome.",

I'll have the first of three synvisc injections to my bum knee on  Monday, and I've been purposefully minimizing knee activity, to help the swelling go down and thus make room for the injection.  I'm also traveling way too much for work again, so in and out of airports and hotels more than is healthy.  So i get a good amount of steps in, just coming and going, but I'm avoiding anything that would cause pounding on the joint, so cardio?  Hardly.  I am trying my best to get in 2 strength training sessions each week, with some great counseling from the gym's trainer. He knows my issues and has great suggestions for maintaining the strength training routine while still avoiding putting stress on the knee.  And he took an LE workshop, so he's full on board with my LE precautions, too. But all the cardio-avoidance means I'm gaining weight, sigh.  Well, in truth it's also because I've fallen back in love with sweet things, after managing for a long time to convince my brain that sugar wasn't one of the essential food groups!  Wow, what a power that stuff has to influence our food choices.

However, conventional wisdom on using it to help LE is that we do a gentle bounce, almost a rocking movement, not letting the feet leave the trampoline surface.  Having said that, I just saw an extensive article claiming that the more aggressive jumping makes lymph flow some crazy multiple speed or volume (article doesn't say which) over being still.  I'm not sure I'm buying into that assertion, and after seeing your question on another thread, I sent a link to that article to several LE experts for comments.  I'll post here if I learn anything from that inquiry.   Now, we know for sure that moving muscles helps to move lymph, because the muscle action against the lymphatic capillaries plays a big role in pumping the lymph through our system.  Adding compression garments helps the process by giving a firm surface against which the capillaries are being pressed.  So exercise is a help to LE, although I don't think anyone has proven that it prevents or cures this stoooopid condition.  Aggressive exercise that raises core body temperature can make things worse, and with strength training and all other forms of exercise, including I suppose jumping on a rebounder, one key to minimizing the potential for swelling (from raised temp, or example) is to start easy and work up, so the body becomes accustomed to a higher level of exertion.   I seriously doubt that you can do yourself any harm, with LE or otherwise, if you start with the gentle bouncing and see what happens.  Keep us posted on what you notice when you do!",

When I discovered I had LE, it was before I had a green light to return to aggressive cardio or any core or resistance training, per my plastic surgeon after my diep reconstruction. So we had time to figure out what LE would mean to my workouts, once I would get the OK to re-start them. Todd's first response to my announcement that I had LE was to say, you have lim-fa-what-a?  But then he agreed to host a one-day workshop for trainers and LE therapists, and we brought in an expert --Cathy Bryan, the lead personal trainer in the PAL trial--to teach them what they need to train people with LE who want to include weight training in their workouts.  It was an amazing day, extremely well received, and everyone left with full documentation about a PAL compliant program for women with breast cancer-related LE. The workshop included all they needed to know about modifying form to meet our needs; the PAL precautions, obviously; and a good sense of what kinds of limitations to be aware of that come not only from our LE, but also from all the BC treatments, and the various recon methods.  He totally 'gets' the PAL precautions and since re-starting the weight training last March, I have had no swelling flares at all, although sometimes I get more than the usual ache in the arm, which informs our decision on what amount of weight to use in the next session (back it down).  Todd has offered to put on a free, twelve-week group PAL session for up to eight women (no more than he can supervise in a group setting), but we have not found other women who want to take the class. Our town's hospital helped foot the bill for the workshop, but for reasons I'll never understand, they and their LE therapist (my CLT) just don't seem interested in asking the oncs and breast surgeons in the area to get the word out that this is available.  I'm still working on that, and it's a cryin' shame, because I'm not the only one who should benefit from Todd's help and expertise.  Unfortunately, the oncs and surgeons are not responding when I try to reach them.  It's more testimony that LE doesn't pass the 'who cares' test..until a surgeon or an onc gets it! My ideal gift to everyone with LE would be to find them a trainer with as much interest in LE concerns as this guy.  Oh, I might mention that he has a son with Down syndrome...so he's really tuned into what it means to have limitations and to want to find ways to work with and around them.",

If I have otherwise been picture perfect in my LE care, I do not seem to have serious consequences from skipping it. But if I have overdone arm activity, or eaten too much salt, or not consumed enough water, I feel achey and doing MLD helps a lot, but I need to be consistent over several days to end the aches. But I cannot say whether salt, overdoing exercise, etc might not have led to ache had I not missed my MLD, too. I just am not that scientific about tracking cause and effect on all the various factors at play here. I do find fear to be a powerful motivator. When I kayaked for a week straight, all day each day, I was so afraid of what the repetitive motion and resistance might do to my arm, that I was a saint about all othere LE care elements, including twice daily MLD. And although my arm tired out, it never had an LE flare. And I suppose that experience tells me that taken as a whole, all the LE care elements can do a lot to help manage the condition and prevent flares. Which makes me think that today I took two flights. I got plenty of exercise in, 2.6 miles of walking and 2 miles of jogging before leaving home. I wore the sleeve most of the day. I avoided sodium, and I did some deep breathing. But the flying worries me, and I know I did not drink enough water today, so I had best drink a bucket of water and do some MLD now!",

They no longer recommend against lifting more than 5 or 10 pounds, nor against repetitive exercise. But they do recommend introducing strength training and any exercise slowly, gradually, and adding weight or resistance in small, infrequent increments. Here's a link to the profile of Deborah Cordner Carson, an elite Cross-Fit athlete who has primary LE in her leg: http://games.crossfit.com/athlete/14093 I heard her speak--she is wonderful--and she said that her LE leg is stronger than her unaffected leg, and she and her trainers chalk that up to always working out in her leg garment, i.e. against resistance. I find the same is true of my LE arm (but I'm sure not an athlete!). The conclusion I draw from the research is that if I do strength training, I increase the amount of weight I can bear before it becomes 'unaccustomed;' it is unaccustomed weight or resistance on the arm that triggers a stress response in the body, sending extra lymph to the rescue. And of course, we are all different; there's no standard case of LE. So as Glennie learned, for some of us, it might not take much to send the lymphatic system over the tipping point. The PAL Protocol has worked well for me--the slow, small-increment approach. If you haven't seen it yet, here's an introduction to exercising with LE, from the stepup-speakout site: http://stepup-speakout.org/Handout%20doc%20for%20S... LE Land = Frustration City!",

What TV?  Despite this crazy alteration of priorities, I am glad that I have re-focused on exercise and healthy eating, even if it took the scare of my life to get me there.  I have found that working on LE advocacy projects is rewarding in ways I never would have imagined, in addition to helping me learn so much about LE and what I need to do personally to manage mine.  But I think it's totally normal that all of us would long for the days when LE care and exercise and just plain worrying about LE were not on the daily radar screen.  Add in the holidays and well...can we have a 30-hour day, please?",

The idea is to reduce swelling by manually draining the lymph--giving it a pathway to re-enter the circulatory system. A qualified lymphedema therapist performs MLD during intensive lymphedema therapy, and as the therapist helps us to control our LE symptoms, he/she will teach us to do MLD for ourselves. It's not something you can pick up from a book or a video, because you need some good hands-on training to learn the light touch you need to apply, and because the direction you move the lymph using MLD is very specific to a patient's individual LE. Doctors seem to differ on whether they recommend wearing a sleeve if you do not have a lymphedema diagnosis. If you do have LE, it's very important to use a sleeve and some hand compression when you are lifting heavy weights or doing lots of repetitive arm motions. So, you can see how working out in a gym or doing jazzercise or other arm-intensive cardio might require a sleeve for someone with LE.  If you don't have LE, but are at risk, a sleeve is probably not needed for cardio, but it's a judgment call for weight lifting. Why not ask your doctor to talk you through this?  If you have lots of LE risk factors--say, lots of nodes removed plus rads to the armpit, and if you're seriously overweight (a known LE risk factor), you can sure tell your doctor that you are aware of heightened LE risk and want to understand what he thinks are the pros and cons of wearing a sleeve during exercise. If you have swelling, a feeling of heaviness in an arm, or tingling, then you should be insisting on an evaluation by a qualified LE therapist. If your doctor resists, and you believe you have symptoms, there is wonderful information here that you can print and ask him to review: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/what_we_need_healthcare_providers_to_know_about_lymphedema.htm I had an LE diagnosis before I started wearing a sleeve. I had to push quite a bit to get a prescription for LE evaluation/therapy, because my surgeon just did not want to believe what I was feeling could be LE. I pushed hardest when I was approaching the time when my plastic surgeon would give me the green light to return to weight lifting after my reconstruction. When I finally just laid out for him why I was worried and the importance of safe weight training, he responded very well and wrote the script.  So I can relate to what you're feeling.  I do hope you can work with your doctor or a lymphedema therapist to sort out your risks and get you going on whatever precautions let you get back to that exercise!  Carol",

Not only because you had the stamina to do it, but because you had the will to keep going after it inevitably got boring (after three or four flights up and down the same steps, I would be crafting all kinds of reasons why I needed to do something else).  That's really amazing. Hugz, I have slept in UA many times, initially to humor my plastic surgeon who wanted me in compression 24/7 for a long time after one of my surgeries, and then because I found I slept better with some support on my troublesome truncal LE.  I've never used an official LE night garment, but I know that they are less compressive than day garments, so I rather imagine the UA compression accomplishes something similar for mild LE like mine. Of course, just because it has worked for me and caused me no grief doesn't mean it works well for anyone else.  One of these days I will ask my LE therapist about a night garment for when I get really puffy, as in this week's heat.  I have really put off having that conversation, because generally my LE is very manageable, and well...I just don't want to admit I have 'serious' LE. Not very grown up of me, I know. Nordy, after the biking thread we had going a few months ago, I took my bike to the neighborhood bike shop and my friend the owner put an extended stem on it, so I am all ready to give it a try. He tuned it up, and then tuned up DH's bike, too, so soon we'll give the bikes a spin to see how I do.  We have some wonderful trails nearby, including one former railbed that runs 25 miles or so to Lake Michigan. People are crazy drivers on our rural roads, so I prefer to peddle in a protected place. I won't be attempting 50 miles the first time out, that's for sure. Nordy, are your girls cycling alongside you? Tina, I believe you had your bike adapted for higher handlebars too, right? (hint)  You're the one who got me moving on adapting my bike. (thank you!) Kira, it is really wonderful that you're in a position to encourage LE patients to use exercise to take charge and do something proactive to beat LE down, instead of letting LE beat up their spirit. And as for your own exercise, walking the dog brings so many rewards beyond the steps you take. Especially after any day when work tries to get the better of you, dogs just want to be your friend, they absolutely love a good frolic of a walk, and they motivate us to stay out longer than we think we want to. My dog is a terribly undisciplined walker (trainer's fault, i.e. mine) so I tend to play with him in the yard more than take him on official walks, but the effect is the same. There's not much better than watching a pet bounce around celebrating the joy of being a dog. My LE care today:  I took two flights to get across country, twelve hours from door to door, with a long on-the-tarmac flight delay to keep me cooped up longer than expected.  But--I did have 2 hours in my connecting airport, and I spent one of those in speedy motion.  I actually went in the ladies room and put on my heart-rate monitor strap so I would be sure not to take a leisurely la-dee-da stroll.  I managed nearly the full hour in 'fat burning' zone. Pedometer says I did 5.2 miles in total today.  I woke up to MLD, did tons of kegel breaths in the airports and in the airplanes, as well as neck clearance quite a few times.  Pumped fist in the air a lot and walked a little bit during the 5-hour flight, probably not enough.  Drank several bottles of water in flight.  Have I mentioned how much I hate airplane bathrooms???? No Lebed today, but I will end my evening with MLD. Carol ",

I tried to get the hospitals in our area to work in partnership with local gyms to offer some group PAL-compliant weight lifting classes.  I brought in a workshop (PALS for Life) and two of the hospitals gave sponsor money to defray workshop expenses. But neither of them is willing to take additional steps to reach out to area gyms (or even their own cancer center's affiliated fitness center) to put on the classes.  We trained personal trainers and LE therapists to teach the classes.  The LE therapists believe they cannot bill and get paid for teaching fitness classes (although now at Penn in Philly they have OTs/PTs doing just that, and I gave them the UPenn contacts and related information). Nor are they willing to take any time at all to engage with the personal trainers who came, to ensure that safe weight training is available to everyone in our area.  My own trainer is willing to give a twelve week group PAL session for free, to anyone who wants to come, no gym membership required.  But will the local onc and the hospital's therapy division (where they treat LE) do anything to get the invitation to their current and former patients?  Nope!  It's as though everyone just wants to keep the LE status quo, which is to say just keep us in the dark so we don't ask too many questions. I love the thread Cookiegal started yesterday, asking if any of the big charities like Komen will ever get serious about LE.  She and Kira expressed that frustration perfectly. The problem is that our medical community doesn't take LE as seriously as they should. So there's no awareness on which the charities can build.  They probably think WE don't care about getting education and risk reduction information to women at risk and who already have LE.  Because nobody is shouting for it on our behalf. We're all out in the wilderness! Rant, rant, rant...but it feel so good!   My exercise today was minimal.  Babies on knees.  Rocking...I hope that counts as exercise! Carol",

Fear of worsening it keeps me on the straight-and-narrow with the weight lifting, but so far--knock wood--so good!  We all have so many different challenges that stand between us and the fitness levels we desire, all the more reason to keep in mind that we each do what we can, when we can, working at our individual paces.  And...I WAS fortunate to be able to help my trainer get trained in implementing the PAL Protocol! The wonderful PALS for Life program travels around, to train personal trainers and LE therapists.  I brought that workshop to my town, with the help of some hospital sponsorship funds.  I mention this pretty often, because it was that wonderful of a program! Anyone who lives remote from the Philly area, where the UPenn folks run the actual PAL programs, can bring PALS for Life to their town.  PM me for lots of details, if interested.  (I am a big fan of the woman who puts on the workshop, but not a paid spokesperson, really!)",

So eating is on no kind of schedule, and bread makes a convenient good start on impromptu meals.  Kneading can be aerobic!  I put my sleeve / gauntlet on for the marathon morning of dough slinging, and out of curiosity I put my heart rate monitor on.  Not good for endurance, but it sure does give the heart a workout--however brief the bursts. Bread baking and morning chocolate were the highlights of today's LE care for me.  I hope everyone else's day was as good! Carol ",

I will be cooking his favorite game-watching food (chili made with tips of filet mignon...don't ask me how I feel about using such an expensive cut of meat to put into chili of all things...but I love the guy so what the heck, for once a year!). But during the game, I will be multi-tasking for sure--catching up on all kinds of reading, because the game means zero to me! I do like the commercials, though! Here in w. Michigan, we are getting a huge dump of snow that started the night before last. I think we're up to 22 inches or so by now. Yesterday, after doing 2 miles of intervals with Leslie Sansone, followed by an hour of weight lifting and then Lebed opening, DH proposed taking the dog cross-country skiing.  I LOVE being outside with both of them, so I agreed, only decided to snowshoe instead of ski, thinking that I am a klutz on skis and would need to use my poles a whole lot less on snowshoes, i.e. do a favor to the arms and avoid putting weight on them.  Well, turns out that the snow is of the incredibly light and fluffy variety, and being on snowshoes was about useless, as the snow did not compact at all underfoot, and I sank.  I did not need to use my poles, except very lightly just to support my arms--that part was just fine. But yikes, did my legs get a serious workout!  Every step was like a step-up in the gym.  DH was having a challenge X-country skiing through it, too, because we were not on any kind of a groomed trail.  But the dog--well, standard poodles have very long legs, and we should have named him Pogo based on his ability to jump vertically.  So he was in his canine glory, running and jumping.  We all came home pooped but happy, and my fitbit tells me that I walked just over 3 miles in the 1.5 hours we were outdoors.  Today we will go out again, but I'll take the skis this time and see if that's a bit easier. Here's a question for all:  It is quite cold here--18 degrees yesterday when we were on the snow walk. I was bundled to the max, but the hand on my LE side was giving me problems, cold fingers to be specific. Of course, I had sleeve and gauntlet on.  I was wearing glove liners under my huge mittens, and the combination was snug, so I took the liner out of that mitten to see if that would improve things, and it did. My hand stayed toasty warm after that.  I took my other liner out a bit later, when I was getting pretty warm all over from the exercise, but the non-LE fingers then got cold, even as the LE fingers were plenty warm.  So I'm thinking this is odd, and I'm wondering if anyone else who does snow sports has had difficulty with temperature control over an LE hand, and also, has anyone used the little hand warmers that you insert in your glove or mitten?  I might try that, but probably not without first finding a glove or mitten that has a pocket for it, so it cannot touch my skin.",

I usually wear a short-sleeved UA with my sleeve/gauntlet, but no way can I use that compression this week.  I just hate letting the lifting go, because it means dropping back on some weight if I miss more than two consecutive sessions, and I missed two last week because of the surgery. So missing Monday means pulling back on the weights (because I am a very faithful PAL adherent).  Oh well!  But I do think I can walk, just no jogging and need to keep the arms from swinging much, too.  Today I just kept my hands in my pockets.  Ohh that sounds like what my mother said when my brother and I were little and she didn't want us touching candy in the grocery check-out aisle!

His answer: 'very good question!'  He said probably. I'll be asking Dr. Marga that one on Saturday (another over and back to Chicago!). I can never predict how long it takes to drive into the big city, because traffic is very capricious there. So I always allow at least 60-90 extra minutes. Today I arrived a full hour before my appointment, so I spent most of that time walking beautiful Michigan Avenue, which is just a block from the PS office. Stores were not open yet, so no temptations on even browsing, so I got 3 miles in, including the walk to the office.  Now--off to my regional Komen chapter educational committee meeting, where I am cajoling them to put more LE education in their various programs.  I am pooped but do plan some MLD tonight.  Actually did a full course in the PS procedure room, during the time I waited for the local anesthetic to take effect. Heck, I was just lying there, alone, in an open-in-front gown.  I  had awakened at crack of dawn so skipped the wake-up MLD, thus I was glad to find an unexpected opportunity. It's a spectacular day here today!  I hope the rest of you have or will soon get some nice weather for outdoor cardio (or beachside Lebed, in the case of Hugz!). Carol",

It's a system of in-home walking that can be quite challenging, but you can also build very gradually. 'In-home walking' doesn't sound like it could be a workout, but these are very well done--do a little or do a lot, take it easy or add some oomph--great for working your way into some serious exercise, but gradually. And like the Lebed exercise, it's at your fingertips (kinda takes away the excuse for not getting exercise on a rainy day!).   And...glad to hear the PT assistant knows what she's doing.

I read some online exercise tips yesterday, for people who travel for business. One tip was from Chris Freytag, the DVD workout leader and an advisor to Prevention Magazine. Her tip was that she never lets two days go by without doing some kind of workout, even if it's in a gross hotel fitness room or, lacking any other options, an in-room workout of some kind.  I think the two-day window is a very good one--allows for letting exercise go from time to time with no guilt, knowing it will be high on the priority list in a day or two.  I think the biggest reason I don't often skip exercise is because after about nine months to get myself pretty fit, I really, really like the feeling, and I'm paranoid about letting it go.  It took a long time to actually enjoy the hard work of a fast-paced cardio workout, or lifting weights.  I don't want it to feel like 'work' again, so  I stay with it, to keep what I have already accomplished.  I'm still no athlete, but happy where I am!

There are lots more lifts in my program, but those will give an idea of where I am. I do 12 repetitions, which means that if I did just one repetition (like lifting a child every so often), I can safely lift much more. I lose ground regularly with my crazy work travel, when I have to miss two sessions and then back off the weights, but slowly and surely, I have built some strength.  So, I can indeed lift the grandkids, but I'm wearing my sleeve and gauntlet all day, every day, just to be sure I minimize the LE flare risk.   One wonderful byproduct of doing a weight lifting program with help from a trainer, is learning proper form.  I really do pay attention to that when I pick up a child (or a box or a pile of books, etc.), and it's because I'm so aware of proper lifting mechanics.  When I was kayaking all week last summer, I realized I could shift the resistance burden on my arm by picturing myself doing a seated row at the gym, which shifts the weight from the arms to the back.  It was not the customary way (nor the most efficient way) to paddle, but I used it periodically each day to give my arm somewhat of a rest.  That benefit of a supervised weight program is priceless to me--helps me lift things safely in daily life. Oh, like putting a bag on a TSA table or in an overhead bin!",

The lengths she goes to to provide LE care for her patients (those with or at risk for LE) are quite extensive, including LE risk-reduction education; bandaging patients for surgery and afterward; having CLTs provide MLD each day while in the hospital, including instruction on self-MLD; and teaching patients to wrap. She also explained, with fascinating photos, how she does node transfer surgery. I was also fascinated by some lymphoscintograms-- images taken that show the flow of lymph, after the patient is injected with some kind of dye.  They looked to me just like the images the TSA back-scatter machines take when we go through airport security these days--hands over the head in 'stick em up' position and all! The technology to follow the speed and location of lymph flow is really quite amazing, although I have read that it's too expensive to use for general LE diagnostic purposes. Dr. M is certainly an engaging speaker who has a passion for her topic. And she feeds her guests very, very well!  Carol",

I actually worry about overheating when exercising outdoors, which I think would not be good for my LE.  I have done a lot of trial-and-error shopping to find lightweight wicking shirts I can wear when snow shoeing, to help keep from getting too hot and clammy.  I wear an UnderArmour T as base layer, then a SmartWool midweight long-sleeve shirt, then a light (and looser) wicking shirt whose brand name escapes me. Then I wear a Goretex rain jacket over that--so nothing thick and heavy at all. I start with a scarf to keep my neck warm, but only need that for a few minutes. When I ditch the hat, I keep my earmuffs on.  This upper-body get-up works very well for me, giving me lots of freedom of movement and it really does keep me warm.    Oh and OF COURSE I am in my compression sleeve and gauntlet, and I wear a very good mitten suited for snow sports.  I just found a new one on clearance at REI, with a pocket for a handwarmer, but so far I have not needed that at all.   DH and dog and I snowshoe when the weather is good, meaning no driving wind or blowing snow.  In windy conditions, I think I would have a harder time getting and staying warm. Hugz...come on down! We'll have snow for another two months, so there's plenty of time for you to get here.",

We should all be printing this out and handing it to our exercise coaches or simply people who run our gyms.  The second link is a handout for anyone with or at risk of LE who needs some quick guidelines on safe exercise. Ideally, trainers/teachers who read the first document will give this shorter one out to their clients and participants in their classes.

You're a real trooper to get out and walk in between raindrops. I find rain to be absolutely un-motivating. I worry about herbal or other supplements marketed for lymphedema symptoms. Research on anything related to lymphedema is so inconsistent in scope and quality that experts can't even agree on a lot of the basics, like diagnosis methods and standards. I just can't imagine that there's been any study of horse chestnut or even selenium that was rigorous enough to know whether there's a real and repeatable benefit. A few brazil nuts, no problem and I keep them in my freezer. But I steer clear of concentrated supplement selenium. I do love my fruits, veggies, nuts, olive oil, cherry juice, and green tea, though--all reputed to be anti inflammatory, which is appealing when you consider that LE is a disease of inflammation (I think!).  In normal dietary quantity, can they help my LE?  I don't know, but they can't hurt and (except the bitter-tasting green tea) they taste really great!

Becky, have fun today.  Fun with family, especially when there are little ones included, trumps a cardio workout in my book. And besides, no doubt you will log lots of steps so you'll have a good activity level today anyway. Insurance theoretically covers my sleeve/gauntlet, but we will not meet family deductible this year (on a high deductible plan), so it's really out of pocket. It is a bit cloudy here today, but promises to warm up to 70 or so (it has been quite cool). But cloudy is interesting sometimes, because I think it gives the wildlife a sense of security, and they are out a bit more visibly during the day. At this moment, I am watching a bald eagle swoop around, as well as a doe who is on the edge of an island, about 40 yards from the house.  She has no clue a human is watching, and there she is, drinking the water. In the past I have observed does nursing their fawns from this vantage point. We see deer swim to and from that island quite often, usually in groups of 10 or 12, always in a poker straight line, nose to tail, and they take a long swimming route--not the 40 yards from our water's edge, but about 120 yards from another part of the lake.  I see these things much more often on cloudy days than on sunny ones, so it's a consolation prize of sorts. And..if not too windy tomorrow, DH and I may put kayaks or paddle boards in that water!  (We have one kayak that you peddle, so arm be darned...I can do it anyway!) Carol",

So down the hatch it goes! I work with an amazing trainer who has a big heart and charges a pittance for his time. He has a world record in powerlifting, and to get there, he had to be an absolute purist about good form, to get every advantage in the lift. We must make such a funny pair in the gym--me in my old body and gray hair, he in his young, totally ripped muscles. But we have become very good friends since the day I walked into his gym and asked for help getting into the best shape possible during the next 11 weeks, leading up to when I would have my prophy bmx/diep recon. The guy has truly worked miracles with me, and I am very grateful.  Proudtospin has found a wonderful trainer, too. Like a good CLT, they're worth their weight in gold.  And in my case, the trainer costs a fraction of what I have to pay for an hour with the CLT--so it's another pathway to taming the LE beast, and it works well for me.

I drove 6 hours today, home from a weekend with family (including***grandchildren***).  I stopped only twice, once for 5 and another time for 15 minutes (very, very bad I know) and I have concluded that the reason driving aches the arm is from not moving the body.  On my drive on Friday, I experimented by wearing my Solaris Tribute while driving, which prevented the aches, much better than when I wear my compression sleeve and gauntlet.  Only on Saturday, an area around my shoulder blades on my LE side was very tender, and I'm left wondering if wearing the Tribute sent fluid there, although this does not happen when I sleep in it every night. But that day, I wore it 6 hours driving + all night afterward while sleeping.  So today I wore the normal day sleeve, and sure enough, my arm aches after the drive.  Ick.  Lesson learned is that I need to stop and walk several times during long drives. I know this rule and ignore it regularly because gee, I want to spend every last minute with the little ones and not budget added drive time to allow for walks.  Or, an alternate solution is to never drive. because when DH drove us recently 8 hours a day, two days in a row, I had zero issues.  I think that means that as a passenger, there's a lot more fidgeting and moving around, not locked into one position.  And DH says I have a death grip on the steering wheel.  This weekend I traveled solo, so no choice on driving. Anyway, enough musing about driving-related LE discomforts and solutions. I did walk a bit this morning before leaving, 3 miles with daughter and little ones, but that was pretty much it for the day.  Back to the exercise routine tomorrow, and some MLD before bed tonight!

And it already took all the patience and persistance you could muster to get from home to that hotel, so any ability to take the irritation in stride is long gone. Add to that the knowledge that your LE is already gonna bark at you after all the un-ergonomic movement from hauling stuff through the day's travels, and well, those desk people should deliver you a replacement key on a platter, right next to a 6-inch brownie.  If only you could get their attention without dragging butt and luggage back to the lobby.  On your behalf, I'm growling loud enough that they'll hear me all the way over in the grrrr thread! You have had way too many LE-related frustrations lately.  I sure hope your days improve a bit now.   There are two really good lessons to learn from what's been posted on this thread today:1) find ways to stay active, and 2) find the humor in our LE world.  Hugz's posts make me laugh out loud pretty often, and this evening I am howling at the thought of Tina jogging in place while waving at people who are scowling as they are stuck waiting for the train to get by the railroad crossing. And Tina Scissorhands is a good visual, too...take THAT you malfunctional bathing suit!! Ohio, I love Hugz's suggestion for putting her arm around a loved one's shoulder at church.  You could also try crossing your arms to keep them up a bit, but then people might think you're in some kind of anger mode, so if you do that, keep a smile, or at least an angelic look, on your face. Today my ferry ride across Lake Michigan was well, rocky, from the storm. People were having a hard time walking on the ferry--lurching is a better way to describe it--so I stayed firmly planted in my seat for the 2.5 hours.  But wonderfully, the storm moved east as I moved west, and just about on arrival, the storm ended.  Only then it got hot, up to 95 degrees, and in the sun, that was too hot for me to walk very far or very long.  So, no boat deck walking, followed by no pleasant city walking.  Instead I did a long session of Leslie Sansone DVD in my hotel room.  I asked for a main floor room to avoid making people below unhappy, and I had to put the coffee table on top of the bed to make enough room--small room!  But I got about 15,400 steps in, plus another 2,200 steps when I went to a grocery store in search of a salad and yogurt for dinner. I made a walking detour to a camping store I had passed on the way, where I searched good bug repellent products to try (6-day river kayaking-camping trip coming up next month, so I need to start testing my options now).   MLD in another hour or so and I will feel like I had a pretty good LE-care day.

I put it on an hour or so ahead of time, usually, and I always leave it on for at least an hour afterward. But two or three days a week, my goal is simply to get the steps in, with some moderate heart-rate elevation--not breathing hard at all, but aware that my heart is beating a bit faster than a la-dee-dah pace.  When I do that walking, I'm not in the sleeve.  Unless, of course, I'm feeling heaviness or achiness in the arm, in which case I'm in the sleeve because it feels better and I know some trouble is brewing.  I do wear my Solaris Tribute to bed every night, and I wonder if that helps me to skip the sleeve during most days.  I've had it since January, and it's comfortable to sleep in and I feel like I'm working on my lymph flow during the least intrusive part of my day. When I wear my sleeve, I'm always in a gauntlet too.  When not traveling, my work is writing, so I'm at my keyboard all day long, and often well into the evening (bad, bad!). The gauntlet makes me crazy when I'm typing. For some reason, it always seems to catch a few keys that do things like automatically open the 'start programs' window or worse. You should hear me sometimes, cursing at the stupid thing.  That's part of why I really do not like to wear the compression get-up all the time.   I don't have near the LE problems that many of the women here do, so I have no reason to whine about a little keyboard inconvenience. LE is so random, I think it's just the luck of the draw and I'm fortunate to have a pretty mild case of it.",

Ohio, Pat yourself on the back over and over and over, with your non-LE arm so you don't create a monster performing repetitive motions.  But truly 5100 steps is a great day, and it means that you did a wonderful job of working steps into your daily business. Resolving the billing issue is a fabulous bonus! Time for bed for moi!  I'll resolve to get more exercise into my day tomorrow. Carol",

And Nitocris, good for you that you took the full vacation!  Probably proves that removing stress improves LE!  Now you're back in chilly Finland, so you need to keep moving to stay warm!  (Not one to talk; although it's pretty hot here now, the cold months well outnumber the warm ones). Today so far I did Leslie Sansone's 'three fast miles' and now I'm off to the gym for stretching and weightlifting, so a good exercise day for me. And I even got some work in today! Carol",

I always have to remind myself that some studies are better than others. Without access to the full report, it's hard to judge this one's merits because we can't know how researchers defined (or even measured) LE, and how long they followed patients after surgery. The implant study says that 'median follow-up' was 5 years, meaning half were followed up for more years; half for fewer years. That seems a study weakness to me.   Even so, I hope you'll take heart--call this study a good 'hint' at the likely relationship of TE/implant and LE. You can't re-do that history, any more than I can go back and erase the extra pounds that I now know were probably my biggest LE risk going into surgery. We can only move forward to do what we can to minimize continuing risks, and as those of us in this thread know, exercise, if we follow some LE precautionary guidelines, helps manage LE; and building arm and torso strength can help reduce flare risks from daily lifting activities.  So, you are doing exactly what you should--and as Binney sometimes says--Onward!

I didn't get but 4,000 steps in today, because my best canine friend is ill, and he came down with something nasty that gave him problems during the night. Let's just say that he has the run of the house, and I apparently am a deep sleeper on gym days, so I did not hear his middle-of-the-night pacing that means 'please let me outside.' Poor fellow...and so I cleaned floors and carpets for much of the day.  We have a machine. It is heavy. I wore my sleeve. We were past due for some carpet cleaning, anyway.  (Oh, and I cooked rice with boiled chicken to give the dog a bland diet today, and he got some meds from the vet and as of this evening, he's much, much better!) Good thing he's such a good friend!",

I should use Becky's method of doing it first thing on waking up.  Is there an alarm clock that shouts 'move your butt' ? Carol",

I've been buried in work, including some travel these past few days, so barely looked at bco lately. On the exercise front, I'm holding my own, making my daily 4-mile walking goal almost every day; exceeding it some days.  Went to the gym yesterday to workout with the trainer and we moved my upper body weights up a notch, and so far so good today! I really seem to be ok so long as we take care to play by the LE weightlifting rules. Dumbbells don't go up in small increments after a a certain weight, so moving up meant a 25% weight increase for my chest press. So...reduced reps to just 8 instead of 12, and trainer guided my movements to make absolutely sure that my form was perfect.  NatsFan, I hate LE too, but ironically, fear of setting myself up for worse LE keeps me exercising and showing up at the gym, as I do believe that being strong and fit is a good strategy to help avoid arm trauma and drama when picking up anything heavy in daily life. I would not be such an exercise regular if I did not have LE fear nagging away at me. Fitness is of course, good for us all around.  Is this fitness motivation the silver lining in the LE cloud? My daughter and grandchildren arrive Sunday for a few days, which reminds me of one of the most important reasons why it's so important to me to train with progressively heavier weights.  The little ones are getting progressively heavier!",

Also a weight machine for seated row, both sides at once using 40 lbs.  I was in the gym with a trainer 3x per week after starting my PAL-compliant program, and after about a year reduced to 2x per week, and I almost never miss a session. When I do miss more than one session in a row, I reduce my weights a bit for two sessions before returning to where I was before missing.  All of the above so I can worry less about picking up my luggage when I travel for work and can play with my grandkids anyway I want.",

And you're dealing with some very difficult issues.  I wish there was a simple solution, but there's not, so we can just hope that bit by bit, you work through the task at hand until you it is finished and you can move on. Tina has given some lovely insights, and I know she speaks from experience. I'll just send you some virtual hugs and add my voice to the 'we're all thinking of you' refrain. Today I had a pretty good exercise day, deciding to complete some wedding and baby gift shopping. I parked my car some distance from a lovely, lovely little town's shopping district and enjoyed a fabulous couple of hours of walking and ducking in and out of the shops. The weather was beautiful and my recipients are all in France, so of necessity I purchased very lightweight items-so no drama or trauma carrying them with me as I shopped and then returned to my car.  Tally: 9,656 steps, which is a good result on a day when I spent the rest of my time glued to my desk. Becky and I were indoors 100% of the time spent at the NLN conference, so I needed a good dose of outdoors this week!  Dawne, I'm back to you on that particular thought: are you able to get outside for some Mother Nature therapy, even for a few minutes?  That is, if the weather is enjoyable and kind to your LE.  Carol",

Hugz, I've made that Hamelman bread, and it is wonderful. Sourdough really adds a special taste, and all the steps are worth it for the many layers of flavor and texture that are in the finished product. My favorite bread is a three-day 100% whole wheat bread that includes a sour mash made of some of the flour. The no-knead bread is very flavorful, but I like to be able to shape my bread into something more than the round loaves you make with most no-knead breads. I wish I could claim my hand kneading as exercise but alas, that would be stretching things a bit!",

If cardio is your focus, then the document I linked to earlier can guide you.",

I had bilateral mx with 5 nodes removed on one side, and I do have LE, so I can say from experience that the risk is there.  There's a lot published from studies about the benefits of exercise with LE, so my view is to try to find ways to do it without mortifying my lymphatics.  I'll bet you've done just that without even thinking about it, but of course, there are no guarantees.

Muscle movement helps move lymph, and the flight itself of necessity makes us rather immobile, so movement at other times seems intelligent. Drink tons, which will help you with movement because you'll need to walk to the restroom often.  And it supposedly thins the lymph to help it keep moving. Drink water, of course. Avoid salty foods, put the arm up in the air and pump the fist 20 or so times, and do this once per hour.  Flying (in my opinion; studies are not able to say conclusively) stresses the arm because cabin pressure is less than on the ground, and I find that one big stress in a day is all I can get away with. I learned this the hard way, early after starting to fly again after surgical recovery. I flew across country and changed into my workout clothes on arriving at my hotel, and then did an hour of serious cardio work with tons of arm pumping.  Bad idea!!!  I swelled up, including truncal areas that were tender and burning for days afterward, despite all my MLD and other efforts.  So now, I walk a lot on flight days while in airports, fast enough to realize my heart rate is slightly elevated, but not with pumping arms and not breaking a sweat.  The next day I try to get back to some real cardio work.  Oh, and avoid double stress from both flying AND hefting a lot of cumbersome suitcases and bags.  I have a very small rolling bag that weighs only about 3 lbs empty and although it's only a 16\" bag, I can get three days of clothing in it when traveling for work, plus I hang from it a small brief bag with my work papers, laptop, and my minuscule purse.  I don't check a bag if I can avoid it, so what I carry is really tiny and lightweight--usually the packed bag weighs less than ten lbs.  Most empty roller bags are about 6 lbs for starters.   It takes some planning, but you can put the odds in your favor for a no-LE-problems flying experience.  Most of all....have fun on that trip! Disney properties are the best playgrounds in the world. What a great place to rejuvenate the morale after it's been beat down by having to deal with LE! Carol",

I had a minimal-movement weekend, driving 5 hours to see family, celebrating my parents' 60th wedding anniversary and otherwise spending time with my daughter and her family.  It rained, and we were so intent on cramming so much into the weekend, I never walked at all.  (But I did make a halloween costume for my toddler granddaughter...her mom wanted her to be a garden gnome, so a garden gnome she is!  Cannot count that as exercise or LE care, but it was sure fun!!)  So today and this week I need to return to activity.  I'll be in lots of airports later this week, so concourse walking will keep me moving.

I agree with NatsFan that the stretches that are in Lebed really do add to general well being, so it's on my radar for today.  Because if exercise machines make me feel like a gerbil, airline travel makes me feel like a pretzel, and I want to untwist myself and stretch those cramped muscles and joints today!  Plus get the lymph moving, of course.

I didn't find a magic elixir, but I did find a few studies concluding that aerobic exercise speeds up wound healing. Now, that does not mean that it's appropriate to do jumping jacks or punch-the-air cardio, but I think it does mean that as Binney suggests, there's a good argument for doing some walking. Walking at even a moderate pace raises your heart rate, and that's what kick-starts the aerobic benefit.  You should be able to find a way to move your legs without a lot of jiggling of your torso, to prevent stress on the wound itself as you breathe in an extra quotient of oxygen.

A week after it swelled, there was no improvement and more of the leg started swelling--my thigh and one side of my calf.  I was wearing a knee compression thing-y, but still the swelling wasn't budging. I have little discomfort-just the occasional twinge--so last Saturday I went to a walk-in clinic, because I began worrying that perhaps I hadn't injured my knee but had a DVT that was causing the swelling and minor discomfort.  I had flown all day from California the day before all this started, so it's not a crazy idea.  But testing ruled out a DVT, and now another week has nearly gone by and I'm still swollen. I've only been home on weekends recently so not a lot of time to seek help, but work lets up after tomorrow so I'll work on getting some answers.  Meanwhile, I needed compression for my whole leg and ordered an inexpensive Allegro leg garment from Brightlife, which will be waiting for me when I arrive home tomorrow.  To help before I get home, I bought a pair of too-small runner's tights--like Spanx on steroids! These have a lot of spandex in them and I can wear them under pants when I work. They seem to have done the trick, at least partially, because after three days in the tights, the swelling is pretty much back to just the knee now. The physician I met with on Saturday who checked for a DVT said I shouldn't rule out lymphedema migrating into my leg.  But I simply cannot go there. ",

So it's great that you're taking action to manage your swelling, and with some luck you may find that it reduces significantly with time. The same study found that women who exercised were more likely than the non-exercisers to see reduction in their swelling, so there's a strategy that may work for you--keep moving!  That said, over-use of your arm or too much weight or resistance can make things worse, so it's important to follow some precautions.  Here's a document to read about that: http://stepup-speakout.org/Handout%20doc%20for%20S... The stepup-speakout site also has wonderful resources on all manner of other LE topics.  Here's the page on knowing if the sleeve fits: http://stepup-speakout.org/proper_fitting_of_lymph... Here's their page about MLD: http://stepup-speakout.org/manual_lymphatic_drain... Here's a link to the official site of the Lebed method of exercise for LE:  https://www.gohealthysteps.com/ You'll find info about the method, and a store if you'd like to purchase a DVD. If you go to YouTube and search, you can find the exercise demonstration in many pieces and parts, presented by Sherry Lebed Davis, the creator.  Here's the first one in the series: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2luK4JRAbo The Lebed method is a gentle series of movements and stretches, plus deep breathing, that are designed to move lymph.  Lots of us use the 'lymphatic opening' sequence (the first 15 minutes of the DVD) as a warmup before doing cardio.  Some find it works almost as well as doing MLD. Lots to learn and think about! I'm glad you found us! Carol ",

Oh, and the stated cause of the cyst and bursitis is long-term overuse...i.e. age.  Ack!  I liked it better when I thought I had injured myself--not a sign of age, and something that gets better.  These apparently do not.  I plan to get a second opinion, just in case there's another cause that does have a surgical or rehab fix.

I don't know how many steps there are in the lebed opening, but not many!  Mostly it's a routine of slow arm movements, reaching up, reaching out, etc. It's done mostly standing in place, or you can sit. On the exercise front, nothing but frustration to report here.  I'm still nursing my knee, doing gentle PT exercises to strengthen surrounding muscles that are quite easy, because I was already strong from lifting weights, but I do think they're helping.  Mostly the bursitis and baker's cyst seem to be responding to relative inactivity. Whenever I try to do some cardio --PT recommends an elliptical or a stationary bike--my knee and leg swell again, grrrr. So now I'm working on rebuilding ability to do cardio activity by doing it in tiny increments.  I'm up to 20 minutes on the elliptical, somewhat slowly and with no resistance.  Long walks are verboten still, because they make my knee ache and swell. I have kept up my upper body strength training, but I've had so much travel lately for work, vacation, and to care for my elderly parents that I'm not in the gym as regularly as I should be.  So to honor my LE arm, that means (following the PAL Protocol for weight training with LE) that I'm backing off the weight and reps.  Grrrr again!   I guess the good news is that I haven't stopped altogether, but hmmm...I don't have the nerve to get on the scale, but I'm pretty sure of what I would see if I did.  (Probably doesn't help matters that the vacation was six days of artisan bread-baking school, and even though four of those days focused on making spectacular and healthy whole-grain products, eating some of every loaf added up to a whole lot of yummy calories!) So, what is everyone else doing to exercise?  We need to keep this thread on page 1, so it's always in our faces to remind us to move!",

I'm not exercising for the moment, to give some more healing time to a pesky incision that's leaking a fair amount of serous fluid after last week's surgery.  (gmafoley...same kind of fluid you're getting!) My PS tells me there are two schools of thought on this:  one-- mild to moderate exercise helps move body fluids and get them through the kidneys and out of here.  two--any elevated heart rate makes the body produce more fluid.  So his advice was to pick one approach and go with it, my choice.  You all know which one I picked--exercise--and so I did some moderately paced walking on Sunday, just about 2 miles.  Well...fluid seepage increased that night and has not abated much, so pooh....I'm now embracing school of thought #2!  I'll give it a few days before I do any heartrate-raising walking, although I do plan to do some very, very slow walking today to see what happens.

When you lift a knee or do a kick, you are 'consuming' two beats instead of one. The Sansone program assigns miles based on music beats per minute, so that knee lift 'counts' as two steps, even if literally you take only one step. The fitbit gives you one step.  I'm ok with that--I just know that even if literally I did not measure the Sansone mileage count, I was getting a better workout that just steps, because the knee lifts and kicks recruit large muscles and that's a  great heartrate booster. I have been traveling nonstop for days, including the weekend, a combination of work and fun.  I made it to the gym on Monday for my first post-surgical weight lifting session with my trainer, and he and I crafted a plan so I can do more of the weight training while traveling. It's getting very annoying to have to continuously re-start at lower weights after missing training sessions.  I cannot fly with dumbbells, obviously, so I will be doing some of the bodyweight moves that are NOT recommended for LE, but...trainer and I spent a lot of time the other day working on  equating my perceived resistance on a wall pushup with my perceived resistance using dumbbells on a chest press.  We did other, similar testing to try to help me do in-hotel-room resistance training without exceeding my current resistance using weights. I may be pushing the envelope here, and I do not recommend this approach for anyone who can use actual, measured weights regularly.  My trainer is very inventive but he's also well versed in LE needs and the PAL guidelines.  I feel confident in what we're doing and will post back here with progress reports. I have managed to do a lot of cardio walking and also went to a class taught by a friend earlier this week, a combination of step aerobics and floor routines--a great cardio workout, followed by stretches.  Also have kept up on Lebed and MLD. And I'm going to drop BIG hints to DH about some walking poles for the coming gift season, intending to copy/print Hugz' various posts to give him some guidance on what to look for.  Thanks, Hugz...he's always stymied on what to give me, so I know he will be very grateful for such a good suggestion.  I would not have thought of using the poles before, but after seeing all the conversation in this thread, I definitely want to go in that direction with my walking.  (I doubt however that I will bring poles with me for airport walking!)

The good news is that you have an early diagnosis, so with some trial and error to figure out what works for YOU (emphasis on 'you' because although the treatments are standard, our lymph systems are not, and individual differences mean that we respond differently to the standard treatments).   If your sleeve leaves marks on your wrist and your shoulder swells afterward, that's probably telling you that the sleeve doesn't fit quite right.  Also, did you get a gauntlet to wear on your hand?  The gauntlet applies enough compression to the hand to prevent the fluid from moving downward into the hand, and I wonder if you have wrist swelling because you're not wearing hand compression and fluid is going in the wrong direction.  The first fitter I went to for my sleeve put me into one that I later learned was much too big.  Can you ask to try another brand of sleeve or a different size?  If you got it through a durable medical equipment provider (DME) that does not specialize in fitting LE sleeves (that was my problem), you might call around to find a place that has a trained LE fitter.  If it was the LE therapist, I hope he/she will be sympathetic to the need to try a different sleeve brand or size.   Another thought is to try using a compression T shirt.  Lots of us wear UnderArmour men's compression fit T shirts under our regular clothing, although they're a bit hard to hide under a lot of our wardrobe.  We like men's better than women's in that brand, because the women's shirts have cap sleeves that tend to cut into the armpit; the men's version has longer (but short) sleeves.  If you're sensitive to the seams, wear it inside out.  Typically we buy in a size smaller than our normal size, to make it really snug.  I have to wiggle into mine, that's for sure.  I wear the compression T when I'm particularly active, because like you, I have an area that tends to swell when I'm active and wearing my arm sleeve--in my case, on my back near my shoulder blade of all crazy places, and also under my armpit on my torso.  The compression shirt helps prevent that. Sun exposure can be dicey, that's for sure.  Sunburn is a huge invitation for LE to get a lot worse, and the radiant heat from the sun--especially with the hot sleeve--raises the body temperature, and that's an irritant to LE, too.  One strategy is to mist your sleeve with water, so you get some evaporative cooling.  Some people feel they have been sunburned through the sleeve, although I have not had that experience and I'm super reluctant to put sunscreen chemicals under my sleeve (not sure why, but the idea bugs me).  I do a lot of outdoor work in summer and I'm an avid kayaker (where sleeve is not optional).  I tend to wear a large sunproof/bugproof but lightweight shirt over my compression sleeve/compression T shirt combo. Welcome to our forum, and don't be reluctant to rant, because it feels sooooo good sometimes just to dump the LE frustration where everyone gets what you mean.  But don't think that what we're all ranting about is your LE destiny.  Some women here have horrid  cases of LE, but not every case of LE evolves into that.  It's frustrating and makes you crazy no matter if you are Stage 0 or more advanced, but I think you can hope that if you work on figuring out how to control your current symptoms, it may not progress much.  I'm sure others will leave you some insights.  Take heart!  And ask questions, because we have some real LE experts who post here.

This morning I woke up determined to kick my butt back onto the exercise-and-good-eating wagon! I hopped out of bed and onto the rebounder (mini tramp) for 20 minutes of pretty fast walking/bouncing in place, which got my heart rate up pretty seriously.  Then I had to travel for work today, and the Minneapolis airport is a gift to walkers with adequate connection time, which I had.  I did some nice speedy walking, just fast enough to raise my heart rate without breaking into a sweat. Then on arrival to my destination, I walked somewhat leisurely in a large grocery store in pursuit of fruits, veggies and protein for my dinner and tomorrow's lunch.  After last week's family fiesta of eating, I feel so relieved to be eating well and moving again. Total mileage, according to fitbit: 7.22 miles.  Time to eat some crunchy carrots to celebrate!",

Glennie, I agree that any order of exercise is a good order, so long as you're doing the warm-up/cool-down phases.  Both of those are thought to help prevent DOMS--Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness-which is when you get muscle aches 36-48 hours after exercise.  DOMS is a signal that you did a good job of working a muscle to exhaustion, which in turn causes it to strengthen by adding muscle fibers. You might be experiencing some of that in your legs, which you're using with a lot of ooomph on your various cardio machines. So DOMS is not bad, exactly, but when we have LE it's another matter.  The muscle soreness not only signals 'need more muscle' but the lymphatic system can interpret it to mean 'need more lymph' and therein lies one of the big challenges of exercise. It's why, when strength training according to the PAL Protocol, we start with one-pound weights and move up slowly and in small increments, which helps to limit DOMS.  Whether your truncal area is at risk for added lymph from DOMS in the leg is probably not so likely, because they're in different lymphatic watershed areas. But still, it makes sense to me to do what we can to limit any need-more-lymph signal to the body, and I believe that warm up and cool down time helps with that. Jeannie, I'm using the rebounder for cardio, as a way to minimize exercise's impact on my knee. I'm not doing any crazy high jumping, more of a march in place and some little jumps, and keeping my arms moving up above my head as I do so.  I find that the arm movement helps a lot to keep my heart rate up, and I hope that the fist-pumping I'm doing as I move the arms is also helping to move the lymph in the right direction.  The rebounder I'm using has bungee cords to hold the trampoline material to the frame, instead of springs. The ones that use springs tend to have a harder landing impact, or so I read. I know as I'm using it that there's definitely impact, so it's not a free lunch, so to speak, for my knee problems.  But it's easier on the knee than when I was speed walking and jogging. I find it's more impact than using an elliptical machine, but I like it a whole lot better.  Now, if I only had the grace and coordination to bounce and jump on the thing on one leg--the one with the healthy knee--I'd be in business!  I see the orthopedic surgeon on Monday for a 4-month check-up after a steroid injection in the bum knee, and I have a good list of questions for him, most about strategies to get back to better cardio exercise. I did just my regular strength training in the gym yesterday, no time for a long cardio session.  Hoping to work that in today.",

I don't recall seeing any research showing that aerobic exercise helps with LE, but I think it makes common sense that being in shape helps minimize LE flare-ups.  I say that because we know that raising core body temperature can trigger swelling, which is why it's not a good idea to do 'hot' yoga or spend time in a sauna or hot tub.  Hard cardio exercise raises core temperature, so you'd think that would be a no-no, but I believe that like weight training, when you build up slowly, it increases your capacity to do more exercise without taxing yourself.  So, if I'm fit enough to be able to climb four flights of stairs without getting all out of breath, I probably am climbing those stairs without getting in a sweat, raising my body temp, and tempting LE to flare.  Again, I have no scientific evidence for that statement, I just think it's logical.  By extension--try to do cardio where and when it's cool in temperature, stay hydrated, and pause periodically to take deep, slow belly breaths.  Deep breathing stimulates the largest lymph transport organ in the body.",

They work your muscles in ways quite similar to light dumbbells, only you cannot measure the exact amount or resistance, nor can you move up--add more resistance--in small, measured increments. That's why with LE, it's generally better to use dumbbells.  Is your PT also a certified LE therapist? For those without access to the LiveStrong program at a Y, some Ys put together their own programs, because the LiveStrong one is expensive. Only recently did an area Y start offering LS in my part of Michigan, but several area Ys and some private gyms have long offered classes for cancer survivors.  One area Y revamped their program after the lead trainer/program director attended a workshop for trainers, all about LE and weight lifting. Her eyes were opened wide and as a result, I think their program is more LE-friendly than if they offered LiveStrong (which last I checked, has the trainers watch a short video about LE and the PAL trial).  Like so many things related to LE, finding a good (and affordable!!!!) exercise class means doing lots of homework and requires a certain dose of plain old good luck. Yesterday, I said goodbye to a houseful of wonderful family--9 grown ups and 7 children were here with us--people were sleeping in every nook and cranny--and I barely sat down for those six days.  Not that I'd call it exercise, although I did duck out twice for a workout at the gym, but I managed to stay moving.  Too bad I managed to eat a lot, too....my daughter and nieces are great cooks, the guys are handy at the grill, and we had lots of family celebration foods.  So now I need to get back to reality and eat better, exercise more!",

Some compression Ts have a scoop or V neck, but they hug the back of the neck and still show under clothing. Flat seams on the inside, so it can be worn right-side out like a normal garment. Many of us wear compression wear inside out to avoid having seams irritate us. Choice of sleeve lengths: some like me are quite short; others quite tall. I have some long-sleeve compression Ts with sleeves that are laughably long on me, and it means I have to alter them.  I'll bet that some women have trouble with sleeves that are too short.  We're just not one-size-fits all. I would love a compression T that is nude in color, for wearing unobtrusively under lightweight, light-colored garments. Please, if a logo must be featured prominently, place it down low, near the bottom of the garment.  We like to wear our compression Ts as a layer under other garments that may have a low or partially buttoned front, and if there is a huge, beacon-like logo, this is not going to work.  I don't care to wear a form-fitting compression T as my only top garment, but like a camisole, I would like to let it be seen under something lightweight that I wear over it. The UA logos effectively prevent me from wearing their Ts as my underlayer with anything but athletic clothing. Wicking fabric!  Layers can be pretty toasty, and we need this support year 'round. Watch how short-sleeved Ts are cut.  Many of us find that we cannot wear women's UA short-sleeved Ts, because the sleeve is a cap shape and cuts us right under the axilla. I wear a men's small instead of a women's medium for this reason: the men's short-sleeve is long enough to avoid cutting into the axilla. Lots of challenges, and I appreciate any garment maker willing to work on meeting those challenges. One head-scratcher to me, is how to solve the problem of an overlapping compression T's sleeve over a compression sleeve, for those with both truncal and arm LE. The idea of having the option to wear a long-sleeve compression T, which helps camouflage an arm in a compression sleeve, is very appealing, but it cannot add serious compression to the medical sleeve (and yet for truncal, we really want the shirt to be compressive through the torso).  Here's hoping there are some creative minds 'out there' to work on this and other design issues!

They arrived, and I did a rousing workout in the 'true compression' shirt this morning.  The garments are lovely; well constructed and the seams are flat! I like the feel of the fabric much better than my UA compression shirts, which feel plastic-y in comparison to the feel of the Go shirts. I have the impression that the Go shirt wicks better than my UA shirts. But--I think I needed to order a 'cold gear' compression shirt to get the compression I need. At least that's what I'm guessing, because the amount of spandex in the shirts I bought is much less than in the UA shirts, and the Go Athletics website explains that their Cold Gear shirts are comparable to the UA shirt fabric.  The Cold Gear shirts do not seem to be offered in short-sleeve versions, which is why I did not look at them.  I do not find fabric composition (spandex/elastane percent) for any of the fabrics on their website (and I don't now if that's available on the UA site--never looked!). I have heard from Go Athletics and they are indeed reading our posts and working on addressing our needs, so wow...that's just terrific, and I am content to see how that plays out.  I rather imagine that if any of us asked for a short-sleeve version of their Cold Gear shirt, they would help.   ",

But that's just one manufacturer, and it's not possible to say if the same would be true in another maker's shirt, or even the same shirt on a different person. What we need is a store that stocks the full lines of compression and shapewear, from all makers, sorta like the compression gear equivalent of Sephora or Ulta.

To Cindy's point, there needs to be a way to have certain fit options, and sleeve length is an excellent idea for that.  Go Athletics is now working on a standard cut for a compression T that will have some features we're interested in, and they have our very long wish list from earlier in this thread. To help with that, I have some samples they made up and I've been asked to take a sharpie and mark on them where shape changes would be helpful, and send them back.  I'll be working on that this evening.  Of course, my shape is not everyone else's shape, so this is just a start for them to get a general sense of how 'we' differ from athletes in our shirt-fit needs. But--and here's where I think we can all be very optimistic--Corey at Go has suggested that they would be able to make custom shirts. I think their first step is to get some standard-sizing shirts in the product list, but then just think about the possibilities--a downloadable worksheet to specify things like sleeve length and perhaps circumference of the sleeve cuff, to accommodate some extra room for those of us with large upper arms because of LE.  I'm thinking out loud here on the 'how' because nothings's been said in my correspondence with Go, since an initial conversation that included the possibility of offering custom shirts.  I rather imagine that the number of custom-measurement choices can't be unlimited, but if you think about it, there probably are only a few individual adjustments that any of us might need. It helps everyone, including Go and any other garment maker who is paying attention (not holding my breath on that, however!) if we continue to review our various shirt experiences in this thread, which might save some trial-and-error as this project continues.

Tina, yesterday's 'bust out' swelling got even worse after the early evening cardio, and my entire abdomen became quite swollen. I have a scar below the belly button that runs fully across and goes back several inches on each side, and I often get some swelling just above that scar by the end of the day. Getting fluid to move under that scar toward the inquinals is not very likely, so when it happens I try to scoot it north toward the cleared neck nodes. So last night I did slow and prolonged MLD, and fortunately, this morning the breasts and abdomen were back to normal.  It's 85 and humid here, so conditions are ripe for a repeat of yesterday. I think this daily swelling (and even yesterday's heat-induced swell-fest) might still be post-surgical swelling from my mid-December diep stage two, which included liposuction to the abdomen. My LE therapist thinks that might be the case too, although we're right at the 3-month mark so it's hard to say for sure.  My PS tells me that six months to a year for lipo-related swelling to resolve is not unusual. I think I would be mighty unhappy if I did not have MLD as a tool to help with the post-surgical swelling.   Oddly, my arm and the usual truncal spot are just fine today, even after 45 minutes of treadmill cardio and an hour of weight lifting in the gym. My midsection is again a little swollen, but not as bad as yesterday and the breasts seem fine.  So far! I'll be drinking tons of water and ending my day with MLD.  Lebed?  Maybe... Carol ",

Those photos will be crystal clear to an exercise pro.  I'm working out in a gym, so we use a combination of gym equipment and dumbbells to implement the PAL Protocol, but it's entirely possible to do it just with a set of dumbbells at home.  In the gym with dumbbells and machines, my trainer is super creative about changing up the exercises and exercise combinations so it's never boring.  But...I live in a small rural town where people don't charge so much for their time, at least not this trainer, so the cost is really minimal--not like what I'm sure you find in bigger cities.  So I appreciate that using a trainer long-term is not realistic at $50 /  hour for trainer time. Long story short, it works best when you can have a trainer watch your form each time you pick up the dumbbells, but I think if you are focused on what the trainer tells you and pay careful attention to stance, arm/leg/hand positions, etc., after a few sessions you can use the weights at home and be just fine.  Then perhaps do a tune-up session once per month, to check form as you've added some heavier weights to your program. Somehow, the PAL exercises and guidelines need to be more accessible to the LE masses. In the NLN newsletter a while back that focused on exercise, Katie Schmitz wrote about the challenge of getting it out there safely.  She said they're working on a four-week in-gym program to get women ready to continue a lifting program at home.  The challenge is still to train enough trainers to make even that accessible to enough women.  I wish they would consider a DVD that demonstrates the in-home exercises, and a second DVD meant for personal trainers so they can train lots and lots of trainers. Or something! Carol",

I think that Binney has mentioned that she's had some success getting insurance to cover a shaper camisole that she finds very comfortable and does a great job of compressing where her LE issues are.  Maybe she will fill us in when she stops by again.   Shaper camisoles and UA shirts are not official LE garments, but lots of us find that wearing them simply feels good!  Your surgical may be exactly what you need, and I cannot comment on whether a cami or UA would be a good alternative strategy for you. Why not ask your LE therapist what she thinks about using a cami?  TJ Maxx sells some, as does Target, so you might be able to find something to try that's not so expensive. The ball bouncing is using one of those big exercise balls, sometimes called a stability ball or a Swiss ball--huge, and you can sit on it.  Many LE patients find that bouncing on a mini trampoline (gentle bouncing; not leaping off the tramp) helps the lymph flow; and some of the women here found out that sitting on one of the big balls and bouncing it up/down for a few minutes has the same effect.  The CD is The Lebed Method Focus on Healing through Therapeutic Exercise and you can see a description here:  www.gohealthysteps.com/store/?...  Many parts of this DVD are available online as youtube videos.  I don't have those links, but perhaps someone will be able to post them for you.  And keep on walking! I travel a lot for work, and when I'm away like that, walking is what is most available to me, and it's a great way to get the heart and spirit pumping.  And it's great because you can work up gradually to speedy walks, no trying to keep up with a class or a DVD, and you can do it pretty much anywhere (at least when the weather cooperates). Oh, and Tina got some of us started climbing stairs. A little goes a long way!   Looking forward to reading your posts about some great walking! Carol ",

He feels I do not have full range of motion in my LE-side shoulder, so we worked on that for a while. I even did Lebed opening!  But I had planned to try the ball bouncing and did not work that in, so tomorrow for that.  Compression while weightlifting, MLD on waking and will do it again before bed.  I feel great today! I think that's the real point, no? Carol",

I have not been able to budge my weight s single pound in the past month, even though I am eating like a saint. But I too see and feel a big improvement in how my clothes fit, so I am not really discouraged by the scale. I do manage to keep moving while traveling for work, but in many ways that is easier than when I am home. At home, there are many more problems to solve, chores to complete, and especially fun distractions. In a strange place, on foot with no car, there is not much beckoning to me in a hotel room, and in an airport there is really nothing interesting to do. So I walk! I savor reading on the plane and for an hour or so before bed, but otherwise, walking feels like the perfect way to pass idle time. In winter I use hotel treadmills and that's boring, but I need to follow up on Becky's suggestion to listen to books. Anyway Kira, my travel fitness requires much less dedication than everyone else who is home and has lots of good reasons to do other things after work or after home duties. Carol (writing this while eating a bag of raw veggies during a seminar lunch break. Participants just told me about a river walk I can do after 5, so looking forward to that!)",

Worry + distance + LE = big frustration.  I'm so sorry this is all happening when you have so many LE limits imposed on you.  Arrghh! I had a lovely day, full of sunshine walking and some retail therapy thrown in to boot.  I did manage a 30-minute heart-pumping cardio session and will head to MLD in a few minutes.  My arm does ache, high up under the armpit and well down to the elbow, and I can't think of anything out of the ordinary that triggered it.  Could it have been ambient pressure changes when the morning's cloudy gloom changed to brilliant afternoon sunshine?  I'll be that's it.  Carol",

I have to travel a good distance to find a clothing store, so I tend to wait until I need a few things, but it gets tiresome fast because taking off/putting on tries my patience even when I'm not feeling puffy. Yesterday I was in a perfect little town with fun, non chain stores, and walking the streets from place to place was pure pleasure. And I found some fun duds. I have lost weight since surgery (but not as impressive as Becky's amazing work!), so it is fun when I find something I really like that would never have worked before. Today was a two-flight day, and I got 30 minutes of fast terminal walking between flights. Then once at my hotel, I found the fitness center all wet, including the treadmills and other equipment, after a group of kids went from the pool to play on the equipment. Not sure how they didn't get hurt! So I did the stairs to my room three times in a row and then walked my floor for another 15 minutes. 16th floor! I took the elevator down each time. Thought of Tina while walking up! Pedometer says 5.66 miles. Also, I did lots of kegel breaths in the airplanes. And neck clearing twice each flight. Along with fist pumping, this really seemed to help because I have no postflight ache tonight. It is really wonderful to feel accountable for reporting in here. Thanks, ladies. It means a lot to know I have company in my LE care. Carol",

But on waking up, I'm often feeling pressured to get to work, and at bed time, I'm often dog tired and just want to hit the pillow.  You really have to go out of your way to do MLD. I think it takes some special discipline to stay consistent, even knowing the benefits of doing so. Reporting in here on MLD does encourage consistency! Carol",

I have a netting suit--for river kayaking, although mostly if we keep moving, the mosquitos don't seem to chase us.  Also, we soak a tiny rag in lavendar oil and clip it to the front of the kayak, so that air current picks up the scent.  The mosquitos don't seem to like that smell.  I tried a similar strategy using natural-lavendar scented candles in our gazebo, but nah...not enough scent. The building is screened, but they still can get in from the floor (and just find their way in no matter what!).  Maybe this year I'll look for something stronger in lavendar.  I hate wearing or smelling insect repellent.  I really want to find a more natural solution.

It worked--recovery was a relative breeze.  Fifteen years ago, I lifted regularly, doing so for several years until I injured my back, probably by moving a too-heavy weight plate that someone else inconsiderately left on a machine.  I regretted losing my strength, but I was afraid to lift again for fear of re-injuring my back. Until last summer, when the greater fear of not being strong going into 12 hours of surgery motivated me back into a gym!  But the injury fear prompted me to re-start with a trainer.  I am incredibly fortunate that the wonderful trainer I discovered doesn't charge much for his sessions, and this fellow turns out to have a huge heart.  He gives me much more time than he charges for, and his coaching is simply wonderful.  I cannot say enough in support of working with a trainer, but I do know that in most places, it's so expensive as to be out of reach.  But even two or three sessions can get you safely started. On the PAL question, I brought Cathy Bryan's PALS for Life workshop to our little town. We got seven people together to take the one-day workshop, and the trainers each paid her $299 for the day.  (If they're charging $50/hour to train, this is not a big amount to pay for the PAL training!).  Two hospitals and a local pharmaceutical manufacturer donated funds to cover Cathy's travel expenses, and to cater refreshments and lunch at the workshop.  Cathy was on the PAL Trial research team--she supervised all the personal trainers working with the research participants--and her workshop was really, really good.  Anyone who thinks they might like to round up some trainers and bring Cathy in to get some PAL education going, just PM me, because I will happily share all the documents I created to market the workshop, solicit sponsor funding, etc. If organizing a workshop is too daunting, UPenn's website has a form that certified trainers can complete to request the PAL Protocol documents, which include a detailed how-to with demonstration photos.  They will not give it to us LE patients, but the site says they will provide it to qualified trainers.  Here's a link:  http://www.penncancer.org/physical-activity-and-lymphedema/receive-pal-intervention-materials/ I work with my beloved trainer three times a week (sometimes one or two, depending on work travel) and I feel SO GREAT after starting my PAL-compliant program in January!  I really do notice my strength.  And so far, I have not had any bad LE repercussions. I wear my sleeve/gauntlet before, during and after each session, and we absolutely respect the PAL guidelines during each session. I do have a sense that now I can lift bigger/heavier daily-life items without worry that I'm setting my arm up for an LE flare.  UPenn is now developing an abbreviated in-gym program that is currently offered in Philadelphia as part of a new research project. I understand that it is a four-week program, one day per week in a gym group with a supervising trainer, with the women doing one other day of weight training at home. This is so smart--limit the in-gym time to four sessions, which is enough to teach form and educate on appropriate precautions.  I have been corresponding wtih the program managers at UPenn, because two women here have said they are or will participate, and it's covered by insurance.  I want my local LE therapy contacts to be able to offer insurance coverage, too, and the UPenn folks have been wonderful in sharing--just this week--information about how they have set up the program so that most insurers will cover it as PT visits.  The new program is designed to be offered by PTs. They tell me that not all insurers participate, but most do, although in some cases the patient's co-pay or deductible means that coverage is not all that helpful.  Even so, it's a great start in the direction of having exercise that is configured to help LE be recognized as insurable therapy. My granddaughter weighs well more than the 5-15 pounds that surgeons have been known to say is the weight limit for women with LE.  I would be miserable if I had to respect that kind of weight limit! Not to mention that I have to lift at least 15 pounds into the overhead bin each time I fly for work.  Weigh your lightest roll-aboard--all of mine weigh at least six pounds empty, and most are closer to nine pounds. Even if you check your bag, it has to move in and out of your car on the way to/from the airport. Etc. etc. etc.  We need to muscle up--safely! Carol",

And one more time to clarify, I've been working with the kind Margaret at GO for quite some time to get a compression tee that meets our needs, but I have zero financial interest in this--in case anyone was wondering, as it's not OK to promote products out of self-interest in our forum. Thanks so much to all of you who helped out with the sizing.  This was truly a group effort.  I hope this becomes a valuable resource for lots of us!",

The challenge with the Curves machines is that it's not possible to measure the amount of weight you are pushing against, unlike using dumbbells or weight machines that use weight plates. That makes it a challeng to use a consistent amount of resistance with each lift, and to know for sure that you're adding in small increments.  On the other hand, the Curves machines are built so that as you get stronger, you push harder and by definition, you get more resistance--sort of a built-in way to add weight just as you can handle it.  Curves is the world's largest fitness-training operation, so literally millions of women --and therefore BC survivors--are using those machines.  I asked one of the PAL researchers how the good practices of the PAL Protocol can be brought to all those BC survivors and well...there just isn't an answer.  That doesn't mean the Curves machines are bad for us--they're not, because they get women working on strength training. It just means that the PAL work was not designed to work wtih or test the the special Curves equipment, so when you work with it, you need to be extra, extra mindful to add resistance in very small increments.  The good news for you is that  you were using it before your LE, so you are familiar and can probably gauge the amount of resistance you're adding.  I worry more about someone who goes there, with LE or at risk, not realizing how vital it is to slowly add small resistance. If you know anyone at the Curves where you work out, who is a BC survivor, you would do a great service to mention the PAL research and see if she is working with (or has an opportunity to do so) someone who can help her think through how to use the equipment in a way that's appropriate to her needs.

So, I need a sleeve that can get wet, will dry pretty fast (assuming I'm on the board more than in the water, at least eventually), and won't tighten up too much as it dries on my arm.  Here's one solution:  http://www.zensah.com/womens-arm-sleeve.html.  I wrote to Zensah, the manufacturer to ask about the amount of compression and how the fabric behaves when wet.  The company replied, saying that:   \"Our sleeves are moisture wicking, meaning they do not retain moisture like other brands. Some even wear the sleeves while swimming! We do not put an exact mmHg level on our sleeves, as the only true way to get an accurate mmHg level is by having a garment custom fitted; generally, however, they fall in the 15-20 mmHg range.\" My Jobst is a stock, 20/30 mmHg, so the Zensah would be less compressive, and I am supposing that in the event it does tighten as it dries, that might help prevent problems, even though the amount of support is not as much as I usually get when exercising. My LE is very mild and I use the sleeve / gauntlet only while exercising and flying, so I'm not sure how much pressure I really need anyway--I am in an entry-level prescription sleeve. I'm still searching for a glove or gauntlet that makes sense to use while paddling.  The most promising I've seen so far: www.tommiecopper.com/product/f... .  I'm ignoring the part about copper having some special muscle-recovery properties (is that possibly true?) and zeroing in on the part about wicking fabric, which is the same feature the Zensah fellow touts as making their sleeve suitable for swimming in. I sent an email asking about water use and amount of compression, but the Tommie Copper people have not responded yet. The sleeve seems like a bargain, because at $29.99 for a pair of sleeves,  I really have to wonder what is so different about my Jobst that makes it nearly twice that price for one sleeve!  The gloves, not such a bargain; also about $30 for a pair, but only one will fit on my LE hand. Both items seem like reasonable approaches to compression while paddling, and I'm all for wearing a sleeve instead of a full UA long-sleeve shirt when it's hot out.  One question: if I learn something about the glove that makes it unsuited for getting wet, do we think that I'd be safe with no hand protection, given that the athletic sleeve is less compressive than a 'real' LE sleeve?  I've worn UA shirts without hand protection many times while flying, before I got my sleeve/gauntlet, and I never had issues.  Of course, I'm clueless on the amount of compression in a UA garment, compared to an LE sleeve. If anyone has any thoughts, I'm all ears.  Er...arms! Carol ",

Then we slowed down, following a path we'd taken several times for winter skiing and snowshoeing. We were hoping to spot a basket lost from the tip of one of DH's poles, thinking it might be visible now, before too much vegetation takes over. No dice!  But it was a nice way to end the walk, alongside a pretty little lake where we had watched ice fishing during the winter expeditions.  Today we watched hooded mergansers diving for food (a handsome kind of duck..and very funny because they dive en masse...almost like one of them says 1-2-3 go!)

But--I just cannot put myself into a hermitically sealed tyvek envelope or live life in a bubble.  Our home is on a bluff overlooking a lake. It's a 90-step walk down to the water, and by golly, if I'm going to put all that work into getting back up to the house, I want to get the most fun out of the water when I'm down below! The lake is not terribly developed, cannot see other houses from our own, and it's so placid that sometimes in a kayak we can sneak up on swans and get directly below the eagles that so often perch in the trees.  None of that happens in a motor-powered boat.   But your thought is a very good one, about the bacteria etc.  So--a good reminder that if I've landed in the water from being a toal novice on the stand-up board, I should wash/shower as soon after as possible.  Does anyone think there's any merit at that point in using Hibiclens, just in case I was unaware of a small scratch, etc?  Slathering my arm with neosporin would seem to be overkill. My gosh this is getting complicated. Becky--I'll ask about the Juzo.  And sitting on a stability ball while at the desk is very interesting.  I stand up while I work, at least 80% of the time. My 'desk' is a high pub table, and I have a drafting chair for when I do want to sit, which is not often.  This works very well for me and ended some persistent lower back problems. Cooka, do you ever remove and then re-don the sleeve between regatta events while the sleeve is wet?  That would seem quite the feat! Today I travel home, a combination of a mile-long walk, then a 2-hour train ride, then an hour drive.  I plan to walk a full hour instead of just the one mile to the train station, to be sure I get some steps in today.  Oops--time to run if I'm going to get that in!

Last summer after my bmx/diep, I had to let lots of it go, so this year I am more determined than ever to do lots of dirt-digging.  We don't have enough sun to grow veggies (we are totally in the woods), so it's all about woodland and shade flowers and shrubs.   I do have one area that gets enough sun to grow annuals, but in containers, because the area is fully paved (prior owners...I would have left some garden space in that patch of sun!). I am a little worried about LE risks this season, not just from digging and trimming, with their scratch risk, but from the veritable cloud of mosquitos that we share the air with.  We have a screened outbuilding and obviously I'll use insect repellent, but still...chances of avoiding all mosquito bites realistically is zilch, and especially when I'm doing work in the gardens. Sigh.  Sigh again. Today after teaching my seminar I went outdoors in shorts and t-shirt and got 4 miles of walking under my belt. So far only a little above-normal arm achiness, presumably from the altitude here in Denver, but I did not want to tempt fate by turning the walk into a sweat-factory.  So, I kept the pace moderate and just enjoyed a brilliant blue sky and a mountain view in the distance. I cannot call this cardio work, but definitely I moved my posterior so it has to count for something. MLD coming up soon.  The arm is aching further down toward my elbow than is usual, so I think the altitude is really having an effect.  I'm thinking of wearing my sleeve/gauntlet tomorrow while I work, which would be a first for me.  Everyone looks at me all day and I just have not yet adjusted to the thought of wearing the sleeve and making the inevitable explanations.  I'll decide in the morning.

When my mother was hospitalized a few months back for pneumonia that led to discovery of a carotid blockage, my father announced adamantly that no kids of his would ever make a decision to put him or my mother into any 'home.'  I understood the fear that was prompting that announcement, but their home is not conducive to independent living if health deteriorates (they are in early 80s). So now our strategy is to identify all the plausible facilities meant for independent senior living but have availability of assisted and then nursing support. Then my brother and I will sit down with my parents and ask them to look at it this way:  if you don't want us making decisions for you later, you need to make some decisions now--check these places out, begin adjusting to the idea that you cannot stay in your huge home forever, and start to work out a plan.  Like ohio4me, I'm not looking forward to that conversation, but I'll be there.  I expect to carve out a week when I'll be staying at my daughter's house, and she and I will do all the investigative legwork to see what's available, all the while hiding out from my parents. My brother is optimistic that we can convince mom that it's her idea to check some places out.  I don't think it will be that easy.  Meanwhile, my daughter says she's taking notes on this process and will ask me to sign them, so I cannot be in my own state of denial twenty years from now...she has a good point! Exercise for me today starts with some gardening.  I'll get some good walking in, too, or maybe a Leslie Sansone DVD. Carol",

And all of that is to explain why I took a taxi to the bank building this morning intead of walking the 2.5 miles, and why I gladly accepted a ride back to my hotel at the end of the business day.  Not looking forward to my very early morning flight and probably not planning to trot through any airport corridors, either.  Oh, and did I mention that for no good reason (other than having a cold I presume), my LE arm aches and tingles tonight? And I'm really PO'd at getting a cold, because my destination tomorrow is not home, but to where my daughter, SIL and granddaughter live.  So I will have to keep my distance...crying foul here!!  (And none of this is LE related, so imagine how I would carry on if my arm was puffy instead of my nose!!)  (And compared to migraines, this is of course nothing.

Make the most of the opportunities available to you!  And you surely have some stress to work off, so good for you that you found so many creative ways to exercise and wear down the stress meter! Yesterday I got plenty of steps in, about 10,000, and the BEST part of the day was the fun walk with Kira!  We did get lost, but neither of us cared.  And it was drizzling, and after a while we both ditched the umbrellas, which were inconvenient on narrow sidewalks. So picture us with  uh..glistening hair, happily chatting away as we walked.  I thoroughly enjoyed meeting Kira, and she is as warm and caring in person as she is here.  Kira, thank you for driving into the big city so we could have dinner, walk, get to know each other, and exchange views on the frustrations of LE / NLN.   Today, back in airports for me, with a long connection time so I'll be working those miles on the Atlanta concourses.

Today I finally feel more human after days of a cold, which feels like it has turned the corner.  I caught up on a lot of work and life's little errands, and by about 9 pm I realized I'd not made any effort to get in some activity.  Popped in a Leslie Sansone DVD, only to find that for whatever reason, the DVD player is not working. That will be tomorrow's problem solving. So, I went outside and did laps around my house, which is actually a pretty serious effort, because the house is built into a high bluff, so there are steps on each side, and some serious steps to continue down the bluff to the water below.  I did this for 30 minutes, down the steps to the water, return trip up, around the house and back down the other side, down to the water, etc. I have no clue how many stairs I climbed in all, but enough to get me breathing hard for the half hour, and tomorrow I return to my gym routine so will work longer and harder. The miracle of the evening is that we don't have mosquitos yet.  Shhh...don't tell them I said that, or they'll come looking for me!  Not sure how much longer I'll get away with 9 pm walks, since the house is 100% in the woods!

Tracking the steps under such optimal exercise conditions will tell you what you're able to do, given time and stress-free motivation.  Once home, perhaps you can use that kick-start as inspiration--aim for some number of steps you walked in a NYC hour or day. Have a wonderful time! I hope you do lots of fun activities, and lets send some brownies to whoever it was that invented ibuprophen!!! Carol",

Get on your feet, Hugz, and do what you can, and feel good about making progress even if it's only a little at a time. Carol",

Even taking off a good chunk of time post-surgery to recover, I'm stronger than I ever would have thought possible, especially at this point in my gray-headed years!  I was initially motivated out of fear of not being strong for surgery and for ease of recovery, and then after the surgery, I was motivated by fear of totally losing all the fitness I'd accomplished getting ready for it.  Now the motivation is no longer fear, and oddly, I find it more difficult to stay focused on the goal of staying fit.  That's why this particular forum is so incredibly helpful: We all share the knowledge that staying active helps with this crazy LE, and we all live with the potholes that LE puts in our road to fitness.  So there's never any judgment--we all understand that there will be reasons, not excuses, for taking it easy for a time--and we all truly celebrate when any of us puts LE in its proper place by achieving in the LE care and in the activity departments of our lives. Now back to work.  If only I could walk and work out as much as I type at my dang keyboard! Carol",

I'm also reflecting on how very helpful the strength training was, to keep me out of LE trouble. Not just having a stronger arm and trunk--that's obviously a way to reduce paddling risk--but also because strength training teaches you to be very aware of which muscles are doing what kind of work.  So, as I was paddling, I realized I could change my paddling posture to alter the site of resistance, by directing some of the work to different muscles.  My arm had to participate in every stroke, of course, but I was able to make my abs do more of the hard work with one posture; send some of the load to my traps and lats with another posture, etc. No one explained this to me, but at some point early on I more or less accidentally realized that if I sat up taller and leaned in a bit, the movement of pulling the paddle felt just like doing a mid-row in the gym...and the lightbulb turned on. I sure wish that everyone with LE had easy access to well supervised weight training that follows the PAL protocol.  I'll be applying my paddling discovery to lots of everyday activities now--the point of weight training is, after all, to develop functional fitness.  Anyone reading this thread not familiar with PAL, please know that with or at-risk of LE, it's not a good idea to dive right into lifting weights--precautions are in order to protect yourself--and please either post a question here or PM me for some good resources to learn more if you are considering starting or even re-starting a resistance training program.

These past two weeks I've been noticing annoying ache all down my arm, which is new, and a few days ago I began to notice it's in my shoulder, too.  So I went to see my CLT and her only suggestion is to wear the sleeve more often and do more MLD. Normally I wear the sleeve only in stress circumstances, because at this point I have no visible swelling--so in airplanes, while exercising, and when it's just plain hot out.  I saw the CLT on Wednesday and wore the sleeve/gauntlet all day each day through the weekend. And...the ache turned into pain!  It didn't help that I drove six hours yesterday--in the sleeve--but was in such a hurry to get to my destination I never stopped one single moment. (Drove to daughter's house...they're having baby #2 as I write this!!! --baby is taking his good old time from labor induced this afternoon!) So I compounded problems with stupidity, I guess. I wondered if perhaps the ache/pain isn't LE, but then yesterday afternoon and evening I did three slow MLD sessions, and yup--it felt much better even before I fell asleep.  Today I awoke wondering if the compression is pushing fluid to the wrong places. Maybe the answer was not to wear the sleeve all the time?  Doesn't LE just make you crazy, because the pieces of the puzzle really do not fit very neatly together.  What a crazy guessing game.  Today I ditched the sleeve. And guess what?  Much less pain!  Arrgh--that makes me happy, of course, but don't we just want to know what works, so we can do that and be done with it?  I'm weary of this constant guessing game, including the guess that the root of my problem is that I overdid it in the gym.  I missed three sessions in a row of weight lifting because of work travel and the LE summit, and I had that conversation with my PAL-trained trainer, that we were supposed to back off the weight, but we--both of us--reasoned that I had progressed so far, I could probably ignore that rule.  Wrong! So, I'm frustrated too, especially knowing that some of my frustration is my own doing. And my LE is mild now, seemingly subclinical.  I cannot imagine the frustration of you brave souls who put up with more LE crap than I have to.  Learned my lesson--follow the PAL Protocol to minimize the risks instead of playing fast and loose with those guidelines. Good thing there's a new grandbaby coming to make me forget all of this! End of well, I guess you'd call this a rant.  Against myself.  If misery loves company, I consider myself lucky to have found that company here! Oh, and today I pushed grandbaby #1 in her stroller for 5.5 miles, not setting any speed records, because it's hot here. Becky, if you're reading this, I repeated our trail and then some, only this time I walked past that ice cream place without stopping (not sure how!).  Carol",

I think Tina asked about my 'normal' state of the arm.  Normal state is that I notice a dull, background ache, which has been with me since LE diagnosis.  Overworking makes the ache sharper and sometimes extends it from the normal upper arm, down to the wrist.  That always subsided with one night's sleep, until I started wearing the sleeve all day, every day, per CLT suggestion.  So the question really is--is it the right sleeve fit?  The right compression?  Or am I simply better wearing the sleeve only during stress activity?  Back to trial and error!

So I think they have a hard time understanding how I seem to have it only once in a while. If I broke my arm, I couldn't take the cast off whenever I didn't want to wear it. They know intellectually that I am in discomfort, but I don't complain and only my husband sees me do the boring MLD. So no wonder they are puzzled. In my case, family responds well to the reminder when I need help with heavy lifting or need to stop repetitive motion. I feel lucky for that, and my heart goes out to you if your family makes LE more difficult than it already is. My step count is just under 16,000 today, thank you Delta Airline. One weather delay, one cancelled flight due to maintenance issues, and a delayed replacement flight because the crew got stuck somewhere. Weather I can forgive, and I begrudgingly admit that I do not want to fly on an unmaintained airplane, but I could have done with less walking time today!",

Cindyl, I'm getting slap-happy from the crazy early wake-ups that enable me to get steps in before I start the day sitting on my posterior during all the conference presentations this week.  Picture me sleep deprived, but happy!  This morning Becky and I both headed to the hotel's fitness room at 5 a.m., where she used an elliptical and I did a few miles on a treadmill. Then I went up and then down 7 floors, walking one floor, taking stairs up the the next and running that floor's hallway, then up to the next floor and walking it, then up one and running it...then reverse to cover the 7 floors again.  So now you know I really am senseless!  At home I work the steps in, but in a much more sane fashion over the full day.  Today's step count is 11,607.  And I'll sleep well tonight! (Becky says she's too tired to report in, but that in addition to the 5 a.m. elliptical work, she returned to the fitness center to lift weights for a half hour after the conference sessions ended today.)

One of his kids has Down Syndrome. The little guy is too young to participate yet, but that day will come. For now, his parents are already working on ways to make sure he stays active as he grows. They figure it's a good time to get involved with Special Olympics, and lots of us in town agree, so we'll be cheering, and the fundraising has been pretty successful.  (I'll stand in the rain to egg my beloved trainer on, but I probably won't go out walking or jogging in it myself--am I too wimpy?) Dawne-Hope, my approach with the baggage is to minimize it and to roll it.  When I travel for my business, generally I need just one or two days of professional attire, and for that I subscribe to the Barbie Doll Mix 'n Match Method, or BDM3.  So, one pair of pants and two tops and a scarf.  For three days or more, I throw in a super lightweight jacket but stick with just one pair of pants and two tops. I pack one pair of shoes, a pair of very comfortable and supportive flats (but cute as heck), to wear in my classroom. I also pack a night shirt plus a pair of workout shorts and a workout t-shirt, both in a wicking material so I can wear them more than once while walking, using a hotel treadmill, or doing Leslie Sansone in my room. I bring a small pouch with jewelry and I have my toiletries down to about ten items--tiny bottle of Hibiclens, toothpaste, lotion, some makeup, mirror, brush, toothbrush, floss, neosporin, bandaids, just-in-case Keflex. So I rely on the hotel for shampoo/conditioner. When I approach five nights away, I take a bit more with me, but these few items are usually all I need for short trips. Oh, and I have a little pouch with a spoon and several packets of instant, high-fiber oatmeal, and a little plastic container with cocoa powder. I use the hotel coffee maker to heat water for breakfast oatmeal, into which I also stir a big spoonful of the cocoa powder, because a morning started with chocolate is a morning well started!  That way I am not tempted to eat the donuts and bagels my clients usually put in their training rooms. On travel days, I am in a pair of very comfortable casual pants, such as lightweight jeans, with a shell or a t-shirt that's made of wicking material. I wear a very lightweight sweater or pretty hoodie over that. I wear good walking shoes (use a Propet shoe that is extremely light weight does not look entirely like a clunky athletic shoe). I am very fortunate that it takes a lot, lot of elevated-heart-rate work to make me sweat heavily, so I am able to do my crazy airport walking at a high speed without getting soaked (well, as fast as you can go when pulling a rolling case and dodging and weaving around casual walkers on the concourses).  When walking, I take off the sweater or jacket, and I usually find I need that item once in the airplane, which is often quite cool. I often check a bag with my clothing and toiletries, and that can add to travel annoyance, because of the wait for the bag on landing, and of course, once in a while it does not arrive when I do.  (And I make sure that the light jeans/sweater/hoodie I am traveling in is decent looking enough that with appropriate explanations, I would not be mortified if I had to wear them for work the next day. But that has never happened...always got my case in time.)  My checking suitcase is very small, so I can also opt to carry on if I like. It is made by Antler, weight less than 5 pounds empty, 22\" tall.  But I usually like to carry with me a very small wheeled brief case that will fit under any airplace seat, and I have my laptop, Kindle, and my teaching materials there, also stick my purse in there when I'm walking.  That bag is lightweight and good quality, so it rolls without a hitch.  When I'm doing my airport walking, I pull it with my non-affected arm, but it's so lightweight I think I would be fine pulling it with my LE arm, too.  I put a nylon bag (the kind we buy to avoid using plastic grocery bags) and when I take off my sweater/jacket to walk, it goes into the nylon bag, which I hook over the rolling case.  I also travel with a filter bottle that I refill constantly (can't stomach paying for bottled water, but cannot abide the taste of chlorine in water). This is attached by carabiner to the rolling case. Too much detail?  Sorry--but the point is, I've decided that it is worth the wait for bags to be able to off-load my clothing, etc. and lighten what I have on me while en route. I am no longer sensitive to what I perceive others may think of my functional, but perhaps not highly fashionable professional attire. And if I wear the same top twice in a week--I wash it out if necessary, using a dab of shampoo in sink water--well, so be it.  I guess I forgot to include sleeves...I'm usually in the sleeve only on flight days and when lifting weights; sometimes when doing cardio, such as if I do Leslie Sansone and a lot of arm pumping.  So I bring enough sleeves for changing them as needed.  That's an easy part of this travel affair for me, but I know that those who are using Jovi or Solaris night garments have a bigger challenge for packing light.  I feel so fortunate that I'm at a (seemingly) stable stage 0 with my LE.  Those are all my air travel secrets. Nothing exceptional-just keep it light and roll-able. Carol",

I asked about that when talking to several of the CLT school directors at the NLN conference last month. They said it's unlikely that approach would happen, although they support it, because the physical therapist association has successfully lobbied to keep non-PT/OT providers out of reimbursement. The wait to get into the CLTs, and the expense, are simply crazy in a lot of places and a true barrier to care.  Proudtospin, do keep us posted on what you learn and what you decide.

I walked about 5 miles with women in the family, and they were great about keeping the 4 mph or better pace.  Only...about 1/8 mile from returning home, my foot landed on one of the zillion walnuts all over the road now, and I twisted the ankle, went down in a picture-perfect no-grace landing.  Then limped home.  It's not terrible, but a bit swollen despite some icing and elevation.

      "Content": "Oct 11, 2012 09:36PM carol57 wrote: Shari, walking can be hard on the arm if you let the arm hang unsupported.  So, ideas to try are to put your hand in a pocket at waist level or higher, or to use walking poles so your arms are high as you walk.  Be sure you're wearing your compression garments as you walk, and stop every so often to do the deep belly breaths that you do during MLD. The weight exercises depend on who is working with us, but I think for most of us, it's a simple routine: stretching (back, shoulder, chest, triceps, hamstrings, quadriceps, inner thigh, calves, back) followed by core exercises and alternating upper and lower-body weight lifting.  So, various ab exercises and then (I'm not suggesting any order here) triceps pulldown if you're using a machine, or triceps kick-back with dumbbells from a bench; leg press, lunges, squats, chest press; biceps curl; seated row; back extension, chair digs, side raises, leg extensions, leg curls are all common weight moves in a gym or at home. THE IMPORTANT PART is to make sure that you are lifting very, very light weights at first --start with one pound--and move up very slowly, in very small increments.  Also remember that you should be lifting only what you can measure, and that means no bodyweight exercises such as push-ups or planks, and no resistance bands--because the amount of resistance (or weight against your arm and upper body) cannot be measured, nor can you know if you are adding small amounts of resistance as you change your position while you get stronger. The reason for these guidelines is that getting stronger helps prevent your lymphatic system from interpreting a heavy load as an emergency that requires more lymphatic fluid to be sent to the rescue. But--the very process of getting stronger with weight lifting means that you can unwittingly send that same signal when you pick up a dumbbell, if it's too heavy.   Hence, we acclimate our arms and upper bodies to lift heavier and heavier weights, but we must do that slowly. These precautions come from a research study called the PAL Trial (stands for physical activity and lymphedema).  The simplest way to review the PAL information is to read lead researcher Kathryn Schmitz's article clarifying misconceptions about the PAL Trial results, which were poorly reported in the media when the study was released: http://www.lymphnet.org/pdfDocs/Weight_LE_Misconception.pdf If you start weight training, it's always a good idea to have at least a few sessions with a trainer, so you can be sure your form is good and you don't injure yourself.  Best possible approach is to find a trainer who is familiar with the PAL Protocol.  (But hard to find!)  Finally, lots of us do Lebed exercises, which are not cardio, but a good stretching routine that has been designed to stimulate lymph flow.  Here's the DVD I think most of us use: https://www.gohealthysteps.com/shop/product/focus-on-healing-through-therapeutic-exercise-and-movement-dvd-1014.cfm  I'm not aware of a particular website that focuses on exercise for lymphedema, but perhaps some others will drop in with ideas. And....do what you can, because almost everyone starts off with a little exercise and builds from there! Good luck on finding a way to exercise without aggravating your arm, Carol",

Hugz, the Leslie DVDs are something, aren't they?  Their beauty is that you can put your all into them and really pump up your heart rate, or you can keep the movements slower, building over weeks or months to full-out mode.  I used these when I was recovering from my diep reconstruction, as soon as I got a green light for cardio.  At first I was using no arms, and I was not lifting legs or knees, to avoid straining the abs and other tender parts.  Over time, and as I continued to heal, I added the other movements in.  You are right that this can be more strenuous that walking in a line, because you are using lots of big muscles at a pretty good pace. Someone mentioned a while back that her pedometer was not accurate when using the Sansone workout, and I was thinking about that the other day.  I get about 4.2 miles on a 'five mile' walk.  It's because when you lift a knee or a leg, or do a tap out or some other moves, you are taking two beats instead of one.  She calibrates the mileage to the number of beats per minute of the music, so if you lift your knee and the round trip consumes two beats, a pedometer will count only one step, not two.  But wow...the extra fitness boost you get from that knee-up is well worth 'missing' a step. When I travel, I try to get a ground floor hotel room, so I won't feel bad about walking with Leslie at 5:30 am.  I just love that you need hardly any room at all to do it. Final thought (in my random musings) about Leslie Sansone videos is that if anyone in the LE forum is thinking of trying it for the first time, be sure to read some detailed descriptions, such as on Amazon, before buying a DVD. Some of them come with resistance bands (she calls them 'stretchies') and the routine incorporates upper body work with the bands.  That's not a good idea for our LE arms and trunks, because we cannot measure the amount of resistance to know that we're adding resistance slowly and in small increments.  I have two of these DVDs from before my surgery and LE, and I find that the footwork pace is not enough to keep me moving adequately if I'm just stepping when the DVD is paced for the resistance work.  Better to get a DVD that does not use the bands. Today was full of desk work and then errands, so I started the day jogging 2 miles (in the house, where I can do a loop from one end to the other and back, over and over and over...I'm quite sure my dog thinks I'm a little odd when I do that.). I wanted to listen to analysis of last night's debate while exercising, so jogged instead of doing a Sansone walk. Then I was able to get another 2.4 miles by parking distant to my various stops throughout the afternoon.  Lebed is still on my agenda a bit later tonight. Carol",

But I put up with that--my LE generally is quite stable, and mild enough that I ache more than I swell--because I need to exercise hard to have any prayer of keeping my weight in check.) I'm traveling constantly for work lately and for the next few months, so my exercise during the week has mostly been limited to lots of walking.  Good thing I have weekends to do whatever kind of exercise I want! Final thought, not related to LE:  I read an interesting article in the current Wine Spectator about a study of the effect of drinking wine on heart health.  The Czech researchers found that it works well, but:  'We found that moderate wind drinking was only protective in people who exercised.\" They define exercise as two or more 'instances' of exercise per week, and the article I read did not elaborate on what that meant in terms of type or intensity or duration. The study included 146 men and women and followed them for 12 months. It hasn't been published yet in a peer-reviewed journal. They were measuring HDL and LDL to assess the heart protection benefits of wine, and it's interesting that they found those benefits only in people who reported exercising.  Of course, consider where I read about the study--in a wine magazine!  Hope there's a peer-reviewed article soon!  I do drink red wine with meals, usually about 3 evenings a week, pinning my cancer hopes on research suggesting that small amounts of red wine do little harm.  If this current research is true, it's another motivator for exercise!",

The resistance is hard on my stoooopid knee, so I'm trying to find the sweet spot where I get my heart pumping but my knee doesn't bark at me. I wear a knee brace, which helps a lot. The orthopedic surgeon swears that bicycling is the best exercise for the knee, which I totally do not understand, but he's the expert I guess. After biking, I've been hopping on the rebounder for another 15 minutes of gentle bouncing, the kind that's supposed to help move lymph (feet don't leave the surface). I actually think it helps keep my arm from aching after exercise, and it may be reducing some of the knee swelling, but I cannot prove it. I sure feel like I'm having to jump through a lot of hoops to exercise these days, and the hoops are keeping me from it on days that I really should be doing something. Argh! Yesterday I went into the gym and did strength training and lots of ab work. Today's a work travel day, so I'll have lots of airport steps, but no heart-pumping cardio.

Also waiting to hear when I'll be scheduled for a hip scope to repair a torn labrum in my hip joint...arrrrrrgggggghhhhhh! I WANT a bionic body that doesn't fall apart any more!",

My report: still frustrated by wearing a brace, but feeling great otherwise and yesterday I went to PT for the first time. That went quite well, and I even got about 20 minutes of cardio work in during the session. Meanwhile, when home I'm enjoying an amazing spectacle right outside my door (big, sliding door)--a pileated woodpecker nest! I watched them excavate a hole in our dead tree, and now they're taking turns incubating eggs. At least I think so, because the eggs are not visible, but I cannot think of another reason why the male and female are taking turns inside the tree, at about one-hour intervals. I think this link will let anyone interested see one of the videos I made of a changing of the mom/dad guard: https://www.dropbox.com/l/rtZaCnFMcGEA3bWhHlMAcu So, I may not be getting much exercise, but I'm exercising my sense of wonder!

My written instructions say no jogging or running for 6-8 weeks, and no heavy weightlifting for 3 months.

I've been out of commission for a while myself, realizing a few months ago that apparently my joints are made of eggshells, as persistent shoulder/arm pain was not getting better with PT and cortisone injection. A week ago today, I had arthroscopic surgery to fix a SLAP tear (labrum tear). Recovery is going well, but living a one-handed life is frustrating! I'm right-handed, and that's the surgery side, and the only good thing I have to say about the experiences is that my LE is on the other side, so no flare worries. But there's actually another frustration, because I cannot reach across my body with the right hand to grasp and tug my compression sleeve or night garment, so I cannot don them on my own. DH has helped so far, but he had to leave town for business today, and so I am stuck mulling over what to do now. I do find that wearing the night garment (a Biacare chip sleeve) almost always conditions my arm so I don't need compression during the day, except during storms, when I exercise, and when I fly. Exercise is out for quite a while, but I do need to fly soon. Guess I'll be asking ladies in the restroom to help me, but if anyone here has any brilliant suggestions for one-handed sleeve donning, I'm all ears. I've no clue how I'm going to don the night garment. Sigh. I'll be attending the World Congress of Lymphedema, starting a week from today. Will be traveling with DH, as we decided to make a little trip out of it, so I'll have my donning helper for that trip. While there, I'll be visiting every single garment maker's booth to see if there's any product that can be donned without using the other hand, for when work travel starts again. I doubt it, but at least I may be able to put the problem on a few radar screens. In the meantime, I find that about all I can do while in the immobilizer sling is type! On a laptop or an iPad, where the keyboards are small and my hands are close together. And totally off topic, but here's a link to show what I've been doing with my time since immobilized https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLb-dHgUXdiT... While I was home recovering from hip surgery a few months ago (darn eggshell joints...), I realized that a pair of pileated woodpeckers was digging a nest in a tree literally under my nose. From April 15 to June 12, I got the whole story on video, and in the last few weeks I've been working on making little movies out of what the birds shared with me. This time with nothing to do but type enabled me to finish the movies. Blessing in disguise? And back on topic, is anybody managing to get any exercise in?",

I generally only wear my LE sleeve/gauntlet for high activity and flying, but the truncal issues are nearly constant lately, so I was looking for something highly compressive but with a low neckline (for hiding under clothing, not possible with UA shirts). I think the sleeves on this garment are probably too compressive to wear over a lymphedema compression sleeve, but a seamstress could probably shorten a sleeve if anyone wanted to make it work with a compression sleeve. These things are hugely expensive, though!  I had a friend who works for Spanx send me a discount for employees and their friends, and it included free shipping, but still...it was mighty spendy.  But it does indeed compress everywhere I'd want it to.  And it's a lighter weight garment than the UA shirts, and will play nicely with my wardrobe.",

The spots come in all shapes and sizes, we need to be able to move them around as our LE problems change, and the very fabric that might form the pocket would in some cases reduce the effectiveness of the swell spot.  Having said that, if any of you creative types can imagine a way to make a swell spot pocket work, do weigh in here! And certainly, let's view this as a good start but not the end of compression shirt design wish list suggestions.  If we add more ideas here, I'll keep tabs on them in a separate document so they do not get lost in the thread. I've not had my conversation with Go Athletics yet, but I will report back when I do! Finally, Journey--thank you for starting this thread and for managing to keep it going long enough to attract attention to our needs.",

Here's a question for all who have trouble with seams in compression wear.  Take a look at the TRUECompression photo on this page http://www.goathleticapparel.com/compression-series/true-compression-shirt. Click on the photo for a close-up view of the seams.  These are the flat seams that are currently available. My question for you is whether this type of seam irritates whose with truncal issues along the side of the body, or elsewhere where the seam falls. The seam is about 1/4 inch wide and has a certain thickness to it, so while it does not stick out like a regular seam, it does create a slightly stiff spine, and you can feel the stitching with your fingers. I don't happen to have those issues, so I'm not the best one to judge. Has anyone had any experience with this type of seam?",

I think they're considering a range of off-the-shelf sizes, and ultimately custom sizing as well, and in my wildest dreams I cannot imagine that the price could be in the hundreds of dollars per shirt. Granted that the Juzo vest is custom sized, and the options for sleeve/no sleeve is interesting, but really..one has to wonder why such a simple garment should be so pricey. It cannot be gradient compression, which is one reason that sleeves are so costly, so I really do wonder why a vest made of compression fabric can be that expensive to make.  At least the Belisse bra has some fancy shaping-and-stitching to it!",

I asked about it, and it uses the same technology as the TSA back-scatter scanners at airports. I have to use those regularly and satisfied myself some time ago that the radiation is less than what I get on a flight, so I had the mall kiosk put me in their scanner.   You stand still in a booth, and the scanner goes in a circle around you, as you hold your arms out. What you get as a result is a printout that shows which specific garments on sale at that mall would best fit your figure.  In theory, anyway, because I think there was one pair of pants, maybe one dress and one sweater on the list.  I was told that if I registered on the company's website, I could generate lists of garments from lots more retailers, but when I tried that, the list was really puny, too.  I don't think I have an odd shape that disqualifies me from 99% of clothing, so I assume they're just not partnered up with many clothing lines so they don't show many options.   Anyway, it's an interesting concept whose time may yet come.  I think the Solaris folks have a scanner-type machine that they're experimenting with; at least I think there was something like that at their NLN booth in September.  Wouldn't it be grand, however, to be able to  go to a local mall, stand in a booth for ten seconds, and then order a custom-made compression garment?  Heck, most of us would probably be willing to stand in there necked from the waist up (with curtains around the booth of course!) to get a really precise compression fit. We should keep in mind that dreams cannot come true if people are not dreaming.  So let's dream on. Carol",

If there's a big enough market for the shirts, that will help them take the plunge to give us more variations. Keeping it simple at first will help make this work for all.  The prototype shirt I received would work for any woman who uses a compression shirt for exercise, not just those of us with LE. Hopefully that helps make sure there will be a robust demand for the product.",

Here's the size chart for 'large':  bust 38-40, waist 30.5 - 32.5 and hip 40.5 - 42.5 I have one large shirt for testing and need someone to mail it to!  The designer at GO prefers that each size tester fall within the designated measurements, even though she understands that most of us will not fall within each of the three measurement ranges. But the best approach is to fit the shirts for the standard-size body, and then we'll all adjust our choices as we always do when purchasing clothing. Lots of women raised their hands to help GO out and we will have had 8 women test shirts, in two rounds of testing.  If you volunteered and I didn't check in with you this week, it means I had more volunteers than needed for your size, so I went with the first in each size to raise her hand. And...I need to emphasize again that I have no financial interest in this project--just want to be able to buy a compression tee with a scoop neck, for goodness sake!  If interest is strong and GO can sell some shirts, I do believe they will offer multiple colors and some neckline choices, plus they're open to options such as adding pockets to hold prostheses.   Anyway, I'd love to get a PM from someone who falls in the range noted above, with name and mailing information.

I wonder if it stretches enough to not interfere with the compression layer of a double-fabric shirt, and if it would limit the added heat.  I sure do not know, but I will be asking Margaret, the GO garment designer.  Brilliant ideas from all of you are most welcome!",

One of the ones I ordered has a raglan type sleeve, and I've not seen that with UA, so I thought I would give it a try.  The other shirt I ordered has the traditional sleeve, like the UA shirts.   If these shirts are of good quality, perhaps we can approach this company for help on a design modification to meet our needs.",

Do you have any achy feeling, or heaviness feeling in the arm? These are symptoms of LE.  If you are already swelling, you should be getting some therapy to move the lymph along, including being taught how to do it yourself, i.e., manual lymph drainage, MLD.  Have you visited this site:  www.stepup-speakout.org ?  It's the best resource out there for those of us with or at risk of LE after breast cancer treatment. You mention melanoma but not BC (and I hope you got to skip BC), but if you're concerned about upper body/arm LE, the stepup site will be helpful to you regardless. Carol",

      "Content": "Feb 23, 2014 10:17AM carol57 wrote: Good news! Our friends at Go Athletics now have a compression shirt pattern shaped for women (their products to date have been men's only). They have procured a compression fabric that I think will meet our needs, and I've been wearing the prototype for two days now and find it works great. It's a V neck, with no beacon-like logo that we get on UA shirts, and it's cut long to stay put. The sleeves are similar to men's UA compression shirts, so they don't cut like the UA women's cap sleeves. Go needs to grade the pattern to a range of sizes now, so the next step is to send me samples in the various sizes that others can try on for fit.  So, I need volunteers who can email me their home addresses, so I can mail the shirts to you for evaluation.  It is likely that Go will ask volunteers to use a marker to draw on the samples to indicate where a change is needed, and to write down comments about the sizing and then send the shirts back to them--or to me, as intermediary, if you want to remain anonymous to the company.  Sizes will be small, medium, large and extra large.  After reading some posts in another thread here, I'll ask if an extra small might be graded as well. PM me if you are interested in helping with the sizing.  I've also been in touch with a catalog retailer of LE products who might be interested in offering a wider range of products for truncal LE, such as shirts and camis and the like.  They asked me my opinion on how big the market is for such products, and what 'we' would be willing to pay.  Tough, tough questions!  These products should be covered by insurance in a perfect world, but we all know that the LE world is not perfect and they will not be covered.  I'm pretty sure that what we'd be willing/able to pay out of pocket will vary widely, but I think it's a fair question.  Go Athletics has never asked me about price, but I think they would benefit from the same information. So, I created a survey that we can complete absolutely anonymously, using Survey Monkey.  Here's a link to the survey: https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/2V93CHR I want to stress that I have absolutely zero financial interest in any of the above, and I will have no clue who answers the survey.  Also, Go Athletics has been working on a shirt design for us for a while, and they have not asked any questions about pricing, they have just decided to see what they can work up for us and they're taking the risk that there will be enough customers to justify the effort.  I will share the survey results with them, with the catalog retailer that I'm in touch with, and with anyone else or any company that wants to see what 'we' say about our compression garment needs.  The survey is about more than price--it asks what we like about current options, what needs to be changed, etc.  It also asks how many truncal compression garments we typically buy in a year.  I'm trying my best to find a way to gather information that will help companies that wish to help us, without violating any ethical standard of letting garment makers promote products in this forum. I've posted about Go Athletic's efforts in past months, so that's been no secret all along.  I've asked the mods here several times to tell me in advance if posting a link to my survey violates terms of service, but they've never given me an answer one way or the other.  As a forum many of us mounted a letter-writing campaign to UnderArmour a year or so back, and one of our members even got so far as to fill out a market research form they provided.  And that led to nada, probably because they're a huge company and our collective shirt needs are a drop in their world-wide garment bucket.  So I HOPE that no one misinterprets this effort to be inappropriately helping only one company that wishes to find ways to help us.  The need is currently not being met...we legitimately need the help with better garments. If only one company has agreed to help, I sure hope we can maximize their effort by helping with sizing and market research support. If you'd like to take the survey, just click.  Send the link to anyone you know who might also take it.  If you'd like to try a sample and help with sizing the Go shirts, please PM me.  I don't know how many they'll need, but first step is to find out how many might be interested in helping.",

The very first nurse I saw during surgery prep asked me if I had any arm restrictions, before she even glanced at my surgical record.  When I responded that my left arm should not be touched, after losing 5 nodes in my original surgery, she immediately ran a length of paper tape on that arm from wrist to shoulder, and wrote NO BP-- NO Needles--NO IVs in huge red letters on the tape. I asked her what she would have done were I at bilateral risk, and without skipping a beat, she said she would mark the other arm and do the necessary BP/ IV using my leg/foot.  I was fully prepared to push the issue if I needed to, but wow...the nurse was full on board with arm precautions. From what I read on this forum, my experience may be unusual, and indeed when I had my bmx/recon at the same hospital last July, I did have to argue to leave that arm alone.  Apparently I had one perfect experience in a most imperfect LE world.

Have you worn the shirt yet?  Looking at the photo, I think the sleeves might be a bit too long (overlap compression sleeves too much), and it looks like there might be mesh under the armpit, so less compression there.  Some compression shirt makers put mesh at the pits to help keep the area cool, but unfortunately it also means there's no compression there.  If you don't have any truncal LE that might not matter, though.  But if you're wearing a compression sleeve, be careful not to overlap it with a highly compressive shirt sleeve, because the added compression may be too much. We are ALWAYS looking for new shirt options, so thank you so much for taking the time to post the link. Everyone's needs are a bit different, so I'll bet that this shirt will be investigated by quite a few of us, to see if it looks like it might work for our individual needs. Carol",

Fairly hard with a masters team tells me that you're probably doing a freestyle/crawl stroke, and you're definitely swimming with great power, meaning lots of resistance against the water.  Swimming is fabulous for LE, but only to the extent that the body is in the water, getting the benefit of water pressure. High-power strokes above the water mean you're not getting pressure benefits, and you're definitely doing the equivalent of some heavy weight lifting with zillions of reps.  (And in truth, I think that to get serious pressure benefits from swimming means swimming underwater with a scuba tank; othewise we're not submerged that much. I'm a scuba diver and my water pressure training tells me that there's not much in the top five feet or so of the water.)   My thought to you is that you were clearly quite strong in the upper body and arms  before your surgery, and I'm wondering if your return to the water has triggered your LE. Oh, by the way, I am in awe of your swimming!   Might you consider backing off a while, and doing some formal trainer-supervised strength training, following the PAL Protocol, to bring that arm and torso back to ready-condition for hard core swimming?  You probably gasped at the thought of stopping the swimming for a while, which would be an understandable reaction, but as an observer from afar, I do think it's something for you to think about.  I think I posted to you somewhere here that I kayak, and I do it long and repetitively although it's usually not hard.  I am sure that I could never have done days on end of paddling after my snb/LE had I not already spent many months in the gym, carefully following PAL guidelines, to ready my arm for the abuse.  If you want some more PAL info, please PM me and I'll get you what you need to see what it's about.  If not familiar, PAL stands for Physical Activity and Lymphedema, the result of an 18-month controlled trial of weight lifting by women with and at risk of LE.

She sent me two new prototypes to try, explaining that they're having trouble finding good-quality compression fabric without having to purchase it in, well...quantities suited to a big outfit like UnderArmour.  So I tried the shirts on, and the compression is great, and with luck they'll have access to the quantity of fabric needed to move forward.   So, we're all having a good healthy exercise in patience, and for those of you who volunteered to test sizes, stay tuned.  I have a list of everyone who raised her hand, here and in some other LE forums, and I'll be in touch when I know something specific about the next step.

      "Content": "Feb 25, 2013 08:39AM carol57 wrote: Here is a wish list for compression-fit shirts, drawn from several years of lymphedema-community discussions where compression shirts are a frequent topic of conversation. Certainly no shirt maker will be able to design a garment or a series of garments that can accommodate all of these wish-list ideas. Even so, we hope that a creative garment designer who understands our challenges will design shirts that meet at least some of our needs, in ways that do not exist today. Seams that are flat and do not irritate, so we do not have to wear the shirts inside out. Styles that are wardrobe-friendly: (1) A variety of necklines, including scoop and V neck that are deep and wide enough to disappear under a variety of clothing. But women with truncal swelling well above the breast area need a crew-neck option, for compression there. (2) No logo on the exterior of the shirt to signal \u2018active wear.\u2019 (3) Seam thread that matches the shirt fabric, so the garment works as a non-sport wardrobe item. (4) Color choices including both nude and darker brown skin shades that can be worn unobtrusively under clothing (but not transparent, and in fabrics thick enough to camouflage breast anatomy when not wearing a bra under the shirt). (5) A range of sleeve options: long, short, or none, with options for petite and extra long arms. Excess sleeve cannot be folded or bunched, for fear of adding compression and causing a tourniquet effect. A too-short sleeve leaves a gap between garment and medical sleeve that also invites trouble. Sleeves that are cut not to cut: Some women\u2019s short-sleeve compression shirts are too high under the armpit, cutting into us uncomfortably and too short to reach the top of the medical sleeve. A common solution is to purchase men\u2019s short-sleeve garments, but these are sometimes too long, overlapping our medical sleeve, and they may be too wide to give adequate compression at the very top of the arm. We need a sleeve design that enables the shirt to hug the shoulder, arm, and armpit without cutting or binding, which also means not using non-compression mesh for armpit ventilation. Designed for prosthesis pockets and bra-inserts: Women who did not have breast reconstruction and who use prostheses need a shirt with prosthesis pockets. Many women with truncal lymphedema cannot wear bras, and those who do often find they cannot wear one under a compression shirt. Wearing a prosthesis under a compression garment crushes it and reduces compression because of \"bridging\" (fabric doesn't connect with the skin because of the lift of the prosthesis). Post-mastectomy compression camisoles usually have inside pockets, causing crushing and bridging, so women wear them inside out. Please offer compression shirts with the option to include an outside pocket, so it\u2019s easy to adjust prostheses and the garment compresses across the chest. Women who had breast-conserving surgery or reconstruction would like sewn-in bra cups or pockets made for inserts similar to those that go into an Ahh or Genie bra. We need support and lift without a bra band or straps. These can be painful, but wearing a compression shirt without a bra gives us a \"loaf of bread\" instead of distinct breasts. There is no compression at all in the cleavage, which can be painful to a woman with breast lymphedema. Sized consistently between colors: Dark fabrics often provide more compression than lighter colors. It\u2019s frustrating to find a black shirt that works, only to order the same size shirt in a lighter color and receive less compression. Fabric that retains its compression and does not roll or fray when cut: Sometimes we alter off-the-shelf garments to meet individual compression needs, such as trimming below the ribs when compression is needed only at or above breast level. We would like the fabric to stand up to this D-I-Y customization: no rolling or fraying when cut. Fabric that wicks perspiration and provides UV protection: This one needs no explanation\u2026we wear compression garments in all climates. Shapes that accommodate our shapes: (1) Some shirts seem designed for only athletic body shapes. Women\u2019s shirts seem to provide the tightest fit around the waist, so to get a shirt that adequately compresses the upper torso means choosing a size that is too tight at the waist. The bottom hem then rolls up and bunches. Men\u2019s shirts typically allow for a bit more girth at the waist, without reducing compression above. (2) We need a range of sizes, including 1x or bigger, but also for the very petite for whom women\u2019s \u2018small\u2019 shirts are too loose to provide useful compression. Youth sizes do not offer a shape that is compatible with a woman\u2019s body. Options for compression where we need it: (1) A common trouble area is the back of the shoulder right behind the axilla, where shirts and other compression garments tend not to fit tightly. The area directly in front of and in back of the axilla is where truncal lymphedema most commonly presents and is difficult to control. We need firm, close coverage in those areas. (2) Some women need compression on the upper sides (although not too high in the underarm) but not as much across the front of the chest. Could there be options to customize a compression shirt with extra-compression panels? Options for no compression where it\u2019s not needed: (1) Those with both truncal and arm lymphedema would love an option to wear a long-sleeve compression shirt over their medical compression sleeve, to camouflage the medical sleeve. However, we cannot layer compression over compression. A garment that provides compression to the trunk but not in the sleeve would be a wonderful option. (2) Some women prefer no compression below the ribcage and are trimming their shirts to resemble crop-tops. THANK YOU, garment makers, for considering our special compression-shirt needs!",

Go Athletics is following this thread, and if anyone else out there who designs garments is also interested, the information is available to all. A while back, wasn't there a fashion garment designer with LE who expressed an interest in working on camouflage garments (i.e. to hide the sleeves when they're not beautiful like the Divas sleeves)?  I wonder if she might have some construction suggestions that could help the compression garment folks understand our needs. Anyone who can articulate how the technical details of a garment, especially a compression garment, either works well or irritates, that I missed explaining in the wish list a few pages back--please chime in here.  (sorry 'bout the run-on writing here...I'm taking an exercise break and typing very fast and need to bolt back to my workout!)

They are quite aware that there will be a need to figure out sizing and sleeve length for a wide range of women's sizes.  We had a good conversation --several of them in a conference call with me--and I sent them a lot of LE information so they can learn about LE as needed to understand shirt design needs.  ",

They must have Google alerts on their name on the Web, and one of the principals registered just to say that they would be happy to try to customize a shirt for women with LE.  It's been a discovery process ever since--for them, learning about LE and our frustrations with existing compression shirts that don't fit well and have necklines impossible to wear with or hide under street clothing; the problem of too much short-sleeve compression on top of our  medical sleeve compression, and more.  It's been a discovery process for me, learning about the hoops a clothing maker has to jump through to create a design and secure the right fabric, without committing to purchasing a boatload of fabric before they are sure the design/sizing/compression level works and will sell enough to recover their investment.  The great news is that as a group, we tried to interest the huge UnderArmour company in such a project, and it went absolutely nowhere, even after Binney took the time (at their request) to complete an exhaustive market research survey.  At least Go is taking our need seriously, even though it's fraught with pitfalls.  Can you imagine the variation in our body sizes--being human, as we are? --despite all of us fitting into the garment industry's sizing ranges?  I cannot fathom how Margaret, the wonderful garment designer at Go, is going to produce shirts in sizes that also manage to accommodate our various arm lengths and girths, torso lengths, and 'where' we want the compression!  She's planning to have us test the sizes and offer fit comments, but still..this feels like mission impossible, and yet she and the company are still game.  I have no financial interest in this project but I'm sure going to benefit when I can purchase the shirts when they are ready!  And if they're not perfect, I'll still be mighty grateful to the small company that has been willing to lend us a hand.   More soon, I hope, but if it's a while before the next (sizing) step materializes, I think we're all experts in being patient.  After all, that's required when you have LE.",

The mens' SS shirts have a longer sleeve--just a few inches, but it makes a big difference.  But--do you have a retail store near home that sells these?  Because I find that the fit of even say, a womens small is not the same from stye to style.  As to fabric, just make sure that the item is labeled 'compression fit.'  They make different weights of fabric in the compression line.  I have some that are heavier fabric for winter, and I have one that has a fabric that seems almost like a waffle weave (but no real bumps), so it's lighter weight and does the best job of wicking perspiration of all the UA shirts I own.  If you want to experiment with shirts that are much less expensive than UA, here is a source. I have two of them, mens' size S, and they work well for compression, fit fine, but don't seem to wick quite as nicely as the UA.  http://www.goathleticapparel.com/compression-series?TreeId=1&vmcchk=1   These are $10 - $15, amazingly.

I wish everyone had such great resources at hand! Good for you, for working to get the best help and quite obviously investing yourself in listening, implementing, etc. Flying tends to aggravate my truncal issues if I'm not in some kind of compression. I wear a shaper cami, or better yet (when wardrobe can cover it), a compression T shirt, no bra underneath. I don't think the T shirt would work if I had breast LE, because without cups, there's no real compression on the inner portions of the breasts. But my truncal issue is on my side under the pit, extending around to the back, and the compression T works well--cami works ok. I know I've really overdone something and/or did not have adequate compression when it feels like I have a hard-boiled egg within my armpit. Usually that means I also have a weird burning sensation on my side/back truncal areas.",

And the stats she quoted me for national averages when getting 'just' snb were a joke, but I didn't know it at the time. I really should have followed up with her a year after my surgery, if just to show her my arm and ask to be documented as a example of LE in her practice. But she's three hours away, and I just didn't want to deal with her, and so she has no clue about my LE...and I have helped her perpetuate her myth that nobody gets LE under her care. We are complicated human beings, aren't we? I do hope you will do your follow ups, to make sure you're being evaluated and of course, to add the the body of knowledge about what is still a new approach to treating LE.

How about finding some good workout activity you can do at home, so you don't have to be self-conscious and can do several mini workouts during available hours, without the time and logistics to drive to the gym? I'm not thinking of this kind of exercise strategy to boost weight loss--or hold weight gain at bay, which it might of course help with. Nope, I'm thinking of the endorphins that flood the brain after we energize the body with exercise. You need some of those! I bought a thing-y to put my bike on, so I can use it indoors. Now that our Michigan winter is almost over (I'm only half joking, it's really cold today!), I can ride outside, but I've come to enjoy pedaling while I have my iPad or a TV in view. So many apps are available, there's probably one that you could use to design a realistic exercise re-entry circuit for yourself. Making a trip to the gym feels like an all-or-nothing proposition, so just don't put yourself in a place where you're embarrassed to stop when you need to, or to be seen wearing chemo pounds.

Other brands can only be hand washed and hand dried. Because of Juzo\u2019s garment features, all Juzo garments can be machine-washed and machine- dried on a low-heat setting. Latex Free- Juzo only uses Lycra® compression fibers.

A year ago I saw that there were blood spots in the discharge and went for more eval.  It was caused by a papilloma (benign growth) pressing against breast tissue.  To come to that conclusion I had lots of imaging, and although the papilloma was readily identified as the cause of the bleeding, that same imaging came up with some lesions to be investigated, hence biopsy and findings that led to mastectomy.  But I want to stress for you that the two were not connected--the nipple discharge in my case was fully harmless, and it was a fortunate coincidence that investigating the discharge found cell atypia that led to my diagnosis. Others here had the experience that nipple discharge was indeed associated with their BC, so of course you are doing exactly what you should--get it checked out.  But take a deep breath and try to remind yourself that it may be absolutely nothing.  Easy to say, hard to do, I know!   You are being very smart to ask about others' experience and by being persistent in getting the appointment with the MD you are most comfortable with.  Please report back on what you learn.  When is your next appointment?

It's easy to see why there's so much enthusiasm for surgical solutions, since the traditional treatments are so unsatisfying and frustrating.

That will give you time to get used to them.  Lots of us have problems with the thumbs on the gauntlets being a bit too tight, and making the thumb go tingly.  If you have to wear it permanently, that often means ordering a custom fit.  But for periodic ware, another strategy is to get the thumb wet and let it dry over a marker or something similar that will make it stay a bit bigger than its knit size.  You'd need to have worn your gauntlets a few times for a while to know if you need to make that adjustment.  ",

I've never had sharp pain, and my LE aches are not localized to one spot like you describe.  I do wonder if what you're feeling is some kind of nerve pain. I understand that when a node comes out, there's a fair bit of collateral damage in the surrounding area. I know you didn't have your surgery by a breast surgeon, but I imagine your node was removed by a general surgeon. Neither breast surgeons nor general surgeons seem to be microsurgeons who might have the ability to excise a lymph node with minimal disturbance to surrounding tissue.  I had just 5 nodes removed, and the area where I am numb at my skin is huge! That tells me that the node removal damaged nerves in a wide area. I know you're searching for answers, and it's sure possible that lymphedema can rear its ugly head.  But I hope you'll continue to work with your care team to look for other explanations.  If your pain is from LE, there are lots of treatments that will be of no use, such as the simple use of NSAIDS. But if it's from some other source, then there may be some treatment options to pursue, so I hope you're being expansive in your search for explanations. If anyone else around here has LE pain similar to what you describe, I'm sure she will speak up.  One thing is certain about LE:  nothing is certain!  My aches and discomforts may be quite different from everyone else's. I'm so sorry you're dealing with such frustration. Carol",

Dr. Joseph Feldman, who is a lymphedema specialist and head of LANA, spoke at the OSU LE Summit last August, all about pumps.  His opinion is that years ago he prescribed them regularly, but that now, with more experience, he believes that pumps are best provided to patients for whom standard CDT has not worked, or to patients who for physical or practical reasons cannot perform self-LE care, including MLD (say, inability to use one of your hands to reach where you need to do MLD).",

Surgeons who quote a 6% LE risk when advising a sentinel node biopsy may be understating the risk unless they follow with the explanation that more than one node may be required, and the risk would grow to 25% or so. My SNB was a super abundance of caution, and had I been told of the true LE risk (I was told less than 3%) I would have at least reconsidered my options. I can't tell from his comments if he is estimating LE risk from sentinel node removal alone or combined with mastectomy (as in my case) or lumpectomy. Also, is he assessing risk for just arm LE? Seems like SNB + lumpectomy creates higher than 6% risk for truncal LE, although I haven't taken the time to sort through my piles of studies to see where I got that notion from. Kira, thanks for posting this. Even when the message has some holes in it, it's better to keep LE risk on the radar screen than not, and Rockson's list of precautions are pretty good. I hope those of us who are too aware of LE risk (after the fact) will send this to what seems like a constant stream of friends, loved ones and acquaintances who get the BC diagnosis.",

My case was unusual, because the 'super abundance of caution' really was just that. I was diagnosed with LCIS, which is not cancer but a marker for increased risk of cancer. It was found in both breasts, in multiple locations on each side, which is typical for LCIS. Standard of care is not automatically prophylactic mx, but my family history is so extensive I opted for it. All my imaging found nothing else, but after changing my care from home in west Michigan to Chicago, where I could get a diep reconstruction, I was stunned to hear the Chicago BS tell me that her radiology team wanted me to re-do all my imaging and the pathology. They were not convinced there wasn't something sinister tucked in behind a papilloma all the imaging had easily found. I was worried about insurance and wanted to just move on, as I am self-employed and had rescheduled and turned down work to accommodate surgery and recovery, and the thought of pushing it out another month or so was overwhelming. So I questioned doing another series of mamms and probably another MRI and maybe another biopsy (I'd already had 3), and the Chicago BS suggested SNB instead--go forward with the prophy bmx and recon, but do SNB during the procedure. That's when I asked about LE risk and it was pretty much dismissed, so I agreed to the SNB. In the end, path was clear including the SNB, so my home team had it right. In hindsight, had I understood my risk for LE was probably 15% at least, I would have at least talked with my insurance company to see if re-do of all the imaging would be covered. So...in my case, the SNB was clearly elective, but it does not sound like that's the case for you. If there's some question about whether you will benefit from it or not, get a second (and a third, even) opinion. It IS overwhelming, and I hope you can just tell your surgeon that you're confused, and ask to be walked through the pros and cons of the value of SNB for your BC diagnosis, staging and treatment. And post your questions and worries in the ILC section of this wonderful bc.org resource. One thing I have learned is that we may think we're alone and solving new problems, but there are many who have walked the pathway before us. I am so indebted to a few women here and that I met in 'real life' who helped me puzzle, deliberate, and decide on so many issues. I'm so sorry you find yourself here, but I'm glad you are asking questions and seeking answers. Do keep us all posted on what you decide. And remember too...LE risk is never 100% no matter what the treatment combo. My mother had every stinkin' node removed and crazy amounts of rads, which was standard in her day. She is 84 --surgery and rads when she was 38--and she never got LE! Do what you need to to take care of YOU...and if you opt for that SNB, we can point you to / send you some resources that include strategies to try to minimize your LE risk, and to maximize the opportunity for an early diagnosis so it can be dealt with at its most treatable stage.

I think the lesson learned for me is to call ahead and speak to someone about the LE problem.  In my case this last time, it was standard procedure for a nurse to call, but I'll take the initiative going forward.  Often there's that one nurse who is simply the best at starting IVs, and I'll make sure that they know I'll only tolerate one failure before calling in that person.  We really need to speak up and be firm in these matters.",

The press over your head may be challenging for an LE arm.  There's no shoulder press in the PAL Protocol, and I wonder if there was a particular reason for omitting it.  I do overhead presses every time I board an airplane, which for work is quite often.

As for the diep reconstruction, yes, I had that too, and I have heard anecdotally of women getting LE in the lower body after that procedure.  It's certainly true that there are usually a couple of nodes removed with the flap tissue. The microsurgeons performing this procedure seem very confident that it does not present an LE issue, and that is the rationale for presuming that node harvest from the groin area does not create donor-site LE risk for node transplants. Unfortunately, there's been very litttle research on that point, and while a few surgeons have done thousands of node transfers, largely they have kept records of complications, to the extent they are following long-term, to themselves. Some recent research found that there may be a genetic predisposition to primary lymphedema (genetic issue and/or simply born with missing parts of the lymphatic pathways) in many of those who eventually develop secondary LE (i.e. after surgery or some other trauma). So it's possible that LE is waiting in the wings, and then surgical drama wakes it up.  That might be something for Kimber to think about, because all those surgeries, including the diep, are puttng a lot of stress on the body, no? Kimber, I can only second Binney's spot-on advice about working with a good therapist to sort out what you need, and how a pump might fit into your treatment.  And do check into this forum often, if only to vent over pain and frustration, because everyone here 'gets it' and it's a great place to find kindred spirits.  You've already discovered stepup, speakout, so you know where to find accurate and very practical information to fill in lots of blanks.

Here's a link to the information he posted: http://www.lymphactivist.org/ca_garment_coverage.php His article explains coverage will be mandatory for private insurers, but Medicare continues to ignore the need for compression coverage. Here's how Bob ends his post about the great California news: It is extremely gratifying to see how, through a combination of hard work, perseverance and good luck, California lymphedema patients will be covered for their compression bandages, garments and devices 14 years after I initiated action on behalf of my wife Pearl. It is also satisfying to know that these essential items are considered to be \"prosthetic device\" benefits, a truth I have been unsuccessful in making CMS understand despite confirmatory rulings by dozens of U.S. Administrative Law Judges. Bob, if you're reading this, it is indeed extremely gratifying to see this wonderful outcome of your tireless work! Thank you for all that you have done, and I'll keep a positive outlook on prospects that you'll eventually bring Medicare and Medicaid into the fold! Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "carol57 wrote: I just returned from a trip to Finland, and each way I took three flights, including one leg that was longer than I'd flown since my LE diagnosis about two years ago. For work, I fly about 26 round trips each year, usually requiring four flights total, and generally not longer than about 4 hours on any segment. But getting as far as Finland meant 7 hours outbound and 8.5 hours home on the long flights. My usual approach is to stay well hydrated before, during and after the flights, which of course obligates me to get up and walk to the plane's bathroom a few times. Avoid salty snacks, put the arm up and pump my fist twenty times every hour or so, and do as much walking as I can squeeze in when in the airport before and between flights. Also, I wear a compression cami instead of a bra, and it has nice wide straps and good coverage, because I have some truncal LE and wearing the cami helps keep things flowing on the torso. I was hopeful that my standard LE operating procedure would work on a longer flight, with one change of routine. On my outbound trip, I switched from my compression sleeve and gauntlet to my night garment for the middle, overnight flight. I have a Solaris Tribute. In the morning, I returned to my regular sleeve for the last leg of my journey. No problems!! Not even an ache, which is my usual symptom of LE not under control. On my return flight, I was not planning to try to snuggle in for some quasi sleep, so I kept the compression sleeve and gauntlet on for the entire duration. Did my usual water-and-walking routine in the airports, but I was seated by the window for the long flight and the passengers next to me were on an exhausting 24-hour travel agenda and slept through most of the flight. I did not have the heart to wake them up so I could exit the row and head to the bathroom. So, I drank less water than I normally would have and only got up twice during the 8.5 hours. And....when the flight was descending during the long, slow initial approach for landing, yikes!!! Pain in the arm!!! My normal dull ache became a very deep and sharp ache and this kept up until we landed, when it let up a little. There I was, arm up in the air, madly fist pumping; doing my deep abdominal breathing; stimulating neck nodes; stimulating axillary nodes--nothing helped. Once in the airport for my connection to the final flight home I felt better and then did some walking and downed a huge bottle of water, but even now, about 18 hours after returning home and a night sleeping in my Tribute, my arm is still bugging me more than normal. So, lesson learned: Make sure to get an aisle seat so there's no restriction on getting up to walk and use the bathroom, so no temptation to restrict fluids. Next time I'm on such a long flight, I think I'll use the Tribute instead of my sleeve, so I can find out if perhaps that was also one of the differences between my two long-flight experiences and their quite different LE outcomes. I'd love for others to describe their own flight experiences, especially strategies they've tried that either worked or did not work to minimize their LE issues. There's no credible research 'out there' on the effects of flying with or when at risk of LE, so perhaps we can capture our collective experiences here in ways that can be of practical help for others who need to plan for air travel. So, what have you tried while flying? What worked? What didn't? Log in to post a reply",

One very good study showed that women who started shoulder exercises immediately after surgery had 2.7X the incidence of developing LE within the first year post-surgery, compared to the group that delayed these exercises for 7 days.  At the end of the year, both groups had equal range of motion.  The study concerned only those with axillary node dissection, but even with no nodes removed, there's some LE risk after mx. So it's worth thinking about, and talking with BS and PT resources so that LE risk is factored into the range-of-motion exercise planning.  Ten days' wait is what some of the LE experts are recommending, just as an abundance of caution.   My experience was that once I started my wall-walking and other ROM stretches, progress was pretty fast, and within just a few weeks I was back to normal.  I put tape on a wall at my high-reach point before surgery, and once I started stretching, I put tape as high as I could reach at the end of each day.  I could see my progress daily, and that was very motivating.

There are quickie courses and there are more substantial courses of continuing education, and unfortunately, unless we get out our clipboards and put a prospective therapist through a very pointed interview, we're often not going to know in advance which variety a therapist pursued. And like any profession, some are simply more talented than others, or care more.  Gin, sounds like you found a great therapist on your second try, and Kira you eventually found a good one, too.

It may seem unusual that you have swelling in both hands, if this is indeed LE, but some studies in recent years have shown that LE is a systematic disease, and other studies are finding that sometimes secondary LE (such as after treatment for BC) presents in connection with a genetic predisposition to LE.  You may have been born with some susceptibility.  I had only 5 nodes removed and I have LE, although fortunately on just one side.  Some members here have bilateral LE, even though the only 'treatment' to one side was a prohylactic mx, i.e. no nodes removed other than the few that are in breast tissue.  So it's certainly possible to develop LE on your no-nodes-removed side.   If you spend some time browsing the stepup site, you'll find some great ideas for managing swelling as you wait for an evaluation appointment, and you might try some of the strategies to see if anything helps.  We often suggest trying compression, and an inexpensive way to try that for hands is to google Imak Active gloves.  They're not as compressive as actual LE gloves, but lots of women here use them with success.  I hope others will chime in with hand swelling experiences, and please let us know how you proceed.

I'm lucky with my LE and I know it. Lots of women in our LE forum here have it much worse than I do, and it's not because I did anything better or different; there is a certain amount of luck-of-the-draw for LE.  As Vlnrph said, some of us have a less robust lymphatic system, and research is actually demonstrating that to be true.  Too bad there's no way to know ahead of time if your lymphatic system is a four-lane highway or a country lane when you're planning your surgery! I know some of the women in this forum will weigh in with an honest assessment that will tell you that they are having a hard time with LE. It's very discouraging to have to wear the darn sleeve, go to therapy, do self-lymph drainage (MLD), and of course to put up with aches and tenderness.  I do want to remind you that if you're getting your impression of life with LE from reading in this forum, do keep in mind that forums like this one are a natural 'home' for those whose LE is front and center in their life. I suspect that many whose LE is mild or has been well managed to the point of not being so intrusive, have moved on and no longer participate here.  And, I think that sometimes we post some pretty complain-y comments here, because we can, because it's an incredibly supportive place where everyone understands what we're talking about. And it feels so good to rant sometimes! So please, consider the context of what everyone says here. You are so smart to ask the question--knowledge is such power--but again, don't let fear of LE drive your treatment decision.  Easy for me to say.  I realize this is a hard, hard decision for you.  Best wishes as you consider your options, and I hope you'll keep us posted on your decision when you make it.

Sometime back we had a discussion of bicycle modifications--I had mine altered to make the handlebars a bit more upright so I don't put so much weight on my arms--but we were talking mostly about leisure biking, not the serious cycling you do. But Nordy contributed and I know that she would be glad to give you her thoughts if you can catch her attention. You are so smart to be thinking and planning on ways to reduce your LE risk.

My LE had reared its ugly head prior to stage II of the recon process, and I was very worried about the effect the lipo would have on my LE.  I spent time reviewing posts in this forum to identify bc.org members who had diep and who have LE, and I PM'd eight or nine women to ask about any LE repercussions of the Stage II work.  No one had any worsening of their LE, and several said they thought it had improved. I asked an LE doc and a recon surgeon who works a lot with LE patients for their opinions.  Both felt that the lipo goes deeper than the superficial lymphatics, minimizing any added LE risk.  My diep results were good, but not fabulous, as is often the case--as you know, the reconstructed breasts are swollen as they complete their shaping work, and I believe that most of us need some revision work, and the fat grafting to fill divots, that comes with Stage II.  So I wanted the surgery, but I agonized over it because of my LE. Finally, I took the plunge, reassured by all the people I had spoken with, but still nervous.  And the result was:  no change to my LE!    I later had another minor revision to reshape one breast, and then nipples.  Still no change to my LE.  No guarantees for others, of course, but that's my experience and perhaps it will help lessen any worries as you think about what's ahead.

A good 'lessons learned' is to do whatever's possible to lighten the luggage load when traveling with LE.

All that adds up, plus of course I need some clothing, including what's required for working out. With your added wedding celebration clothing I imagine that your suitcases expanded exponentially! I'm on a campaign to reduce what I carry, and for most trips of a week or so, I can do it with a rolling laptop bag plus a tiny second carry-on. My trip this past week required only a 16\" rolling suitcase plus a tote that is smaller than a lot of purses. Good thing I wasn't trying to make any fashion statements, because this was truly minimalist packing! There are some amazingly lightweight luggage choices available these days. My roller is by IT Luggage and weighs about 3 lbs empty. Bric's and Lipault are more expensive but also quite lightweight. If you weigh your empty suitcase, you might be surprised at how heavy it is. Eight or nine pounds is not unusual, depending on size.",

I was still in my sleeve and gauntlet and walked at a moderate pace with no serious cardio in mind. The temperature was a very civilized 65 degrees or so, with no noticeable humidity. And my hand swelled!!! Several hours later, it's still a bit swollen, and now I'm wondering if I need to get a glove for when I fly, or if the issue is that flying with the gauntlet is fine, but I need to give up on the post-flight walking. I just hate the trial-and-error aspect of LE. I feel like I'm living in a pinball machine, bouncing randomly from one point to the next with no chance at a straight-line path of understanding and dealing with LE.

I get visible swelling from time to time in a truncal spot, but if I relied on pure measurement to confirm my LE, I'd never get a diagnosis.  What did help me nail down the problem was a lymphedema clinic that uses a perometer to measure. It's quite precise and found a 10% difference in volume between my arms when a therapist at another clinic could not find any measurement differences when using a tape measure.  Fortunately, she was supportive of accepting the perometer measures and the inherent shortcomings of her own measurement technology, and we proceeded with LE treatment after I showed her the perometer printout. My primary care doctor acknowledged no experience or knowledge of LE and has always been supportive of my requests for referrals and garment prescriptions so I could get insurance coverage, such as it is.   If you happen by some wild luck to live in either NYC/NJ or Chicago areas, there are two physicians that I know of who have LE practices:  Joseph Feldman and Kathleen Francis. http://www.northshore.org/apps/findadoctor/physici... http://www.barnabashealth.org/Physician-Directory/... Lymphology is largely self-taught, and these two have made a career of it.  Their may be others that I'm not aware of, and if so, perhaps we'll see some information posted here.  You could try a guerrilla tactic and call all the LE clinics in your area, ask candidly if anyone can give you names of physicians who seem particularly knowledgeable in their interactions with the clinics. Or even just which MDs make the most referrals.  That's surely a long-shot approach.  You've no doubt read a lot of posts on various threads in this forum, so you know that the frustration that comes with LE goes in many directions.  I'm so sorry you're having to knock your head against the wall when all you want is some reasonable pathway to treatment.  You have lots of company here.

I've never had a neck IV, but I definitely recall reading in posts here that women who have done that comment afterward that it wasn't bad at all.  In a perfect world, you'd find a well qualified LE therapist and get in to see him/her before your next chemo, so you'd have an expert opinion on whether this is actually LE, and a strong voice in your corner for a neck or foot IV if that's what he/she recommends.  But the world is not perfect and getting that appointment asap is very hard to do.  On the stepup site that Binney linked to above, there's a wonderful page of information for healthcare providers, and there's a downloadable excerpt of it you can print and bring to your next chemo appointment.  These pages explain the importance of taking LE seriously and respecting appropriate precautions. They were written by a doctor, for her peers. If it's LE, it won't go away on its own, but the sooner you start managing it, the less intrusive it will be on your life. Keep us posted! Carol",

They provide a firm surface against which your muscles can operate, maximizing the nudging impact of muscle action against lymphatic capillaries. Night garments have much less compression and use channels of sewn-in bumpy foam chips to press into the skin irregularly but in a certain pattern, to nudge the lymph upward and keep it from pooling. Some, like Jovi Paks and Tributes, look very much like oven mitts on steroids.  They're comfy and soft, but some find them hot to wear.  I'm not familiar with other night solutions but I think the general idea is to apply pressure but not super-compressive like a day sleeve, and that won't do you harm by wrinkling or folding over as you sleep, creating a high pressure point that you're not aware of. The Stepup page on garments gives you an easy way to look at lots of alternatives, day and night:  http://stepup-speakout.org/Lymphedema_garments.ht... You'll find the Tribute under Solaris. I use a Tribute at night and I really love it.  It feels like a hug when I put it on, and almost always it alleviates my daily arm ache.  I wore it once while driving all day, which normally makes my arm flare, and I found that the arm movement all day seemed to cause the Tribute to send fluid into my shoulder and around my shoulder blade, so now I'm wary of using it for what it's not intended, i.e. day wear, when muscles are active.  I wore it while flying overnight to Europe once and the biggest result was some extra glances from my row-mates...they didn't ask, but I explained to help satisfy their curiosity.",

The LE therapist is the best one to figure out if you have LE, and he/she will diagnose based on a series of measures of your arms, looking for size differences that are typical of LE. There's a lot of value in having those measures done by someone who does it all the time, because if using a tape measure, consistency of touch is critical. If you're lucky enough to have access to an LE clinic that evaluates using a perometer, the measurement is quite precise--light waves bounce off your arm to compute arm volume. Measuring is only a part of the evaluation. An experienced, well trained therapist knows what LE tissue feels like, and he/she can also listen carefully to your symptoms descriptions, ask good questions, and recognize early stage LE that others would not. Treatment needs to be provided by a CLT (certified LE therapist) but care migrates quickly to at-home treatment. You would learn manual lymph drainage, often called LE 'massage' (which is not really massage...a very light touch with the fingers to gently nudge lymph fluid out of the swollen area). Depending on severity of your LE, you might also learn 'wrapping' which is the application of bandages that look like Ace bandages but function quite differently. The bandages provide compression while your muscles are at work, and release pressure while your muscles rest. The result is that the muscles have a firm surface to push against, and in turn act as a pump to press on lymphatic vessels and get the lymph moving out of the swollen area. Lymphatic 'massage' and wrapping cannot be learned from a book or a video--it's all about the touch and the wrapping pressure, and both wrapping technique and massage protocol are individualized for each one of us. They call this whole process complete decongestive therapy, and if you have a well developed case of LE, it requires a lot of visits to the therapist, closely spaced for several weeks. But if you get diagnosed early, the therapy is much less intensive and you move to self-treatment faster. My thought for you is to arrange for an evaluation by a CLT. Explain to that person your time constraints and concerns and work together to craft a care plan that you can assume at home as fast as possible. In many ways, LE treatment is a pay-me-now-or-pay-me-later proposition. Prompt, thorough attention up front can save you lots of time and frustration later. Take a look at this site: http://stepup-speakout.org/ --the top of the home page has tons of internal links to topics such as how to find a qualified therapist, what LE treatment is like, etc.--better explanations that I have given you here. The best advice of all is to find the most qualified therapist you can--that's what will expedite diagnosis, treatment, and results. Oh, and I simply have to add: don't be tempted to use an Ace bandage..it's really different and you could make matters worse. I'm not suggesting you would try that, but for anyone 'out there' reading our threads, we can't say that often enough. Photos of LE wrapping can give the impression that anyone can do it with an Ace bandage, but that's a really bad idea. Best of luck--hope it's not LE and you've got some temporary issue and you can move on soon--but if it IS lymphedema, welcome here, and do ask as many questions as you need. Carol",

If your lymphatic system is the culprit for your swelling, you may also be at heightened risk for cellulitis, i.e. infection. If you see that redness expand, then it's not necessarily just angry scar tissue, and you should be seen, stat, to check for infection. Cellulitis is a nasty condition that spreads rapidly and can hospitalize a person within just a day or so if not nipped in the bud with antibiotics.",

And I was wrong--my left arm, the SNB arm, was 10% bigger than my other arm.  By rights it should have been smaller, because I'm right-handed.  So on the merits of the two-arm comparison, it was clear that I had excess lymph in the arm, although I could not see it.  Only when I started reading about LE did I realize what all the sensations I'd been noticing were--LE!  To this day, I rarely have visible swelling, so I'm lucky that the arm LE remains quite mild.  The truncal spot bugs me more often, but thankfully it has not advanced.  So far.  It's common practice to evaluate for LE by comparing two arms, if only one is at risk.  My bmx technically put both arms at risk, but I lost nodes only on the left side and that no doubt explains my LE's cause. Glennie, there's not a board certification for lymphology, so look for mention of experience, special interest, etc.  I think that the wound doctors are starting to take some interest in LE (i.e. those who specialize in wounds that do not heal, diabetic ulcers, etc.).  The doctor you linked to is also a CLT, which is mighty rare.  I don't know anything about the LeDuc school. It's not one of the more common ones, but that doesn't mean it's not a good LE school.  Perhaps Binney will weigh in...I think she's done some good homework on the various schools and whether they're mainstream or not.  Unfortunately, there are some quacky LE training courses 'out there' but I don't want to suggest this doc went to one of those, because I just don't know the school.  It's admirable for any MD to complete a good LE school, which has a lot of hours required for completion.",

Even though I had no nerve sensation to be able to feel the tattoo procedure, all that needle work must have resonated with my lymphatic system and brought unusual quantities of lymph to the quadrant.  Fortunately for me, it subsided within three or four days, but it sounds like yours is hanging on. The shallow breathing could be part of the problem, I think.  The binder gives compression, which would be a good thing for LE, except that you have no need to compress/constrict lymph in your lower ab area. So perhaps the double effect of compression where you don't need it (for LE) and restricting your breathing is doing what you think it is. I wish I had some ideas for solving the problem.  Pain draws lymph the point of an injury, so if you're having pain in or near the swelling, taking a pain reliever could help. Otherwise, I'm not knowledgeable to comment on any meds that either help or worsen LE in this kind of situation. The standard LE routine of elevating your arm and fist pumping, stay well hydrated, and try to move so your muscles can help pump the lymph certainly apply.  Hopefully some others will have better suggestions than I've thought of that can help you put the lymph in its place.

My regular bra size is 38 B, so the large should have been fine.  And it is, except I'm experiencing midriff swelling that's intermittent (maybe truncal LE--having that checked out next week)--and the swelling is much less likely if I wear a camisole with cups knit in--no bra band. The genie bra band, despite being soft and wide, is still snug enough to prompt the swelling.  If that's not an issue for you, this bra might work well for you during recon healing.",

When you returned to your LE treatment regimen, your symptoms improved...doesn't take a genius to realize that excess lymph was causing the problem! Your shoulder injuries from the car accident no doubt left you with lots of internal scar tissue, and lymph does not travel well through scars. It's not unusual for people to develop LE after trauma from an accident. You may have had latent LE (stage 0...no visible swelling but up to 30% more lymph in the area) without realizing it, and then the sentinel node biopsy was the final straw. I have not read of anyone commenting on shoulder mobility problems from LE, but over the shoulder is a lymph pathway from the arm, and I know from my own experience that I can get a very debilitating heaviness and ache in my upper arm when the LE flares, so it would not surprise me to hear that reduced mobility could also develop. In addition to the ideas for over-the-shoulder sleeves, you might try a really tight compression T shirt with your existing sleeve. If you're tiny, it will be hard to find a size that's snug enough to give serious compression to the shoulder, but if you can compress that whole area, it might help. I use a men's size small UnderArmour, in dark colors (have found that the gray version is not as compressive). The women's UA shirts have cap sleeves that are too short and cut into the axilla, but the men's sleeves seem just right. It's hard to find, but they also make boys' sizes in the compression fit, if you need to find something really small. I also have some shapewear that covers the shoulder, and that might help you to get some compression on your shoulder, too. The catalog where I have found some of these is herroom.com. I've had to shorten the sleeve to avoid long overlap with my compression sleeve, but generally they work for me and the necklines are more wardrobe friendly than the UA shirts. Keep us posted on what you figure out. And by the way, here's a shout-out to you and all the other certified trainers in the world...what a difference it makes to have an expert set up and supervise a weight and exercise program. My trainer is one of my lifetime personal heroes. Thanks for doing what you do! And you've got to find a way to tame the LE beast so you can preempt any occupational roadblocks!",

But the Under Armor shirts do not play nice with much of my wardrobe, as the neckline (whether V or rounded) is too high for many of my clothes, and the squish factor on the boobs is uncomfortable, with or without a bra.  So, I searched for more compression options.  Here is one I found, and I just love it, and I wonder if it might be a stand-in for a light LE compression T shirt some are looking for: http://www.timeformecatalog.com/cgi-bin/timeforme/cate_id/apfsha/prod/95559/item_detail.html?keywords=&srcmode=&sortbyprice=  The shirt has a waffle-type weave that is supposed to 'micromassage'.  It is not a 'wave' pattern like the Arm Care. However, the compression of the shirt is quite good, and I find it is giving me more support than the Under Armors.  The shirt is made in Italy and on the box it is labeled as a 'Medical Device Class 1'.  I have no clue what that means! I do not imagine that this item substitutes for a true LE arm sleeve, but as a full-shirt option, it is much more comfortable than Under Armor and has room built in for the boobs. No compression there, but plenty to meet my under-armpit and arm needs. The biggest disappointment is the price: $89.  This catalog also sells some much less expensive compression shirts with scoop necks.  I tried one and I do like it, but it's not as compressive as the one I linked to. I tried to paste in a photo from the website, but no luck. I have a sleeve and gauntlet coming soon for flying and exercise, so I'll be revising my flying approach, but for light compression, this t-shirt may be of interest to others. Carol ",

But the entire quadrant is affected, and I think inevitably some other areas in the quadrant get overloaded with the fluid we are moving. Some women use a paint roller to reach back and gently massage that upper back/shoulder blade/lower neck area.  Another approach is to stand against a wall with a foam roller behind you, and move up and down, with gentle pressure against the roller (and this is also an an ab exercise, and a leg exercise--triple benefit!).  Here's the kind of roller I mean, and there are lots of other types if you google it:  http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002X211R4?psc=1 I hope you get some relief, and this is definitely something to ask the LE therapist about.",

My LE is quite mild (fortunately), but I do know that the first time I became aware I had a problem was after cross-country flights followed by a high-energy, arm-pumping, one-hour cardio session. In retrospect, I probably added insult to injury by doing both that same day. I don't believe that flight 'caused' my LE, as I soon recognized the more subtle, sub-clinical symptoms that I'd been feeling for quite some time without understanding that they were LE (heaviness, mild and constant ache, more pronounced after activity and during barometric changes). But that famous flight + cardio day triggered visible swelling for the first time. That's my experience, and it's just anecdotal, which is about the sum of many of the 'studies' about LE and all kinds of trigger risks. We cannot generalize our experiences, other than to realize that LE can develop or flare after flight and after many other activities. The degree of risk for any one person is not possible to predict. I wear compression while flying, which for me is on average more than a hundred flights each year. A big eye-opener to me is watching what happens to those flimsy plastic water bottles (think Aquafina or Dasani) if half-empty during the flight. They sure do change shape! Cabins are pressurized to about 8,000 feet, and most of us experience LE flares when driving through mountains or experiencing other changes of altitude or barometric pressure. The contorted water bottle during flight always makes me wonder what's going on under my skin, with my delicate lymphatic vessels. I like to think that the compression sleeve and gauntlet help to minimize the effects of the in-cabin pressure changes. netrajkr, there remains a huge question on whether it's wise to wear a sleeve if you do not already have LE. I would say to pay close attention to how your arm feels-heaviness, tingly feeling, low-level burning feeling, weakness, jewelry feels tight but you haven't gained weight. Also watch for any tender, raw, puffy, burning-sensation areas on your trunk, which can signal truncal LE. If you feel you have any of these sub-clinical symptoms, get to a certified LE therapist pronto, and then for sure wear compression, including hand protection and a compression tee shirt, during that long series of flights. If no symptoms at all, it's a harder question. With 3 nodes out there's still risk of LE, although that risk is small. I've never seen any study that convinced me that wearing compression causes LE, if you don't already have it. There's just so much that we don't know about this condition.",

There are two somewhat conflicting perspectives on this. 1) A well-fitting bra will provide some compression to the area and help to prevent lymph from pooling in the breast, if you have LE. 2) Many women with truncal LE find that camisoles work well for them, because absence of a band around the trunk allows lymph to flow more readily than in a bra. There is a legitimate concern about LE after lumpectomy, and particularly if accompanied by sentinel node biopsy and/or radiation to the axilla.  But if you are unhappy with the cami (and a one-sided jigglybounce does not sound fun to me!), I should think you could experiment with bras.  I don't think a bra would trigger LE, but perhaps worsen symptoms if you already have it (on that no-trigger statement I'm out on a limb...hopefully Binney or Kira or LindaLou or someone else with truncal LE knowledge will comment).  Seems to me that every woman who has truncal LE ends up in trial-end-error mode on what works best to keep that lymph flowing. Some of us wear UnderArmour compression shirts; some wear compression camis; some do well with bras.  I was in UA shirts constantly but now that it's hot out, I've been experimenting with bras, and I found a few sports bras that do not look like uniboob sports bras, have very supportive cups and nice, wide bands that hug my truncal area perfectly, providing the compression I want.  I had full recon so my issues are quite different from yours, of course. So ladies in the LE forum, do we think that wearing a bra can trigger LE through constriction via the band and/or the cups? Carol",

My thought is that I might be able to tuck the added fabric into my jeans, adding just enough tension to keep the bra band from rolling or hugging me too tight.  My issue with most camis is that the straps are thin and/or the armhole is too low, not giving me pressure where I need it for my truncal spot.  Hence my DIY idea..and I already own the Genie bra in my discard pile, so no big loss if I don't care for the outcome.  Only I don't think I'll get to this anytime soon!

The research study's 26 patients represent all of their patients 'who underwent ALND and are followed up in our Department of Lymphology, but they represent only a small percentage of the 1500 patients who underwent this type of surgery.'

They do not measure at the same number of points on the arm as an LE therapist would to evaluate and re-check during treatment, but at least the DME knows not to pull too much and uses a non-stretching tape, etc.  So I wonder if you can find out who measures for garments and just ask them, out of kindness, to take some measures--and more than the standards? Also, I am in a bit of a rush so won't take time to review posts on this thread, but did anyone give you this how-to-measure link? http://www.absolutemedical.net/medicalProfessionals/measureSleeves.aspx Again, it's for sleeve sizing, but these measurement points would be a pretty good frame of reference for before/after comparisons. Progressive hospitals and breast centers are making presurgery baseline measurements the standard of care. It is simply criminal that it's not only not standard elsewhere, but that you have to argue, cajole, push back and spit to make it happen.  Boatingirl, I'm already gray but if I were not, reading your experiences would make it happen.

Many women with nodes removed never develop LE, and so far, no one knows what makes the difference between those who do and those who do not. It has been theorized that some people are born with more robust lymphatic systems than others. My mother had every single axillary node removed 40+ years ago and she's in her 80s now and never got LE.  I lost 5 nodes and got LE within months of surgery. So...just guessing here...but maybe you're in the fortunate group and it wouldn't matter if you used any bandage at all, let alone to relentless pressure of an Ace, and you're just not going to get this crappy condition. But I hope we don't want to send the message that anyone who is at risk of LE (and especially anyone who is seeing symptoms) should buy a $6.99 Ace bandage and take horse chestnut before flying, instead of getting an evaluation and learning what she can and should do to manage the flight risks and treat her LE, if she is diagnosed.

As to immune function, I do believe in the common-sense element of David Servan-Schreiber's 'anti cancer' diet, which makes sense for any immune-boosting need, and it boils down to: eat a diet that's very diverse in fruits and vegetables. Another researcher (who is leading trials at MD Andersen to test anti-cancer properties of a number of spices) tells us in his book The Healing Power of Spices to add diverse spices to our diet.  I don't believe for a minute that food or spices = a miracle cure for anything, but it just makes sense to me that eating a whole food instead of what's extracted for a supplement gives us more than what meets the eye.   I can't say a fruit-veggie-spice (oh, and green tea, according to Dr. Servan Schreiber) - rich diet will prevent cellulitis, but it *might* help and can hardly harm us.  I drink some green tea each day (not buckets full) and I shoot for at least 25 different fruits and veggies each week, which turns out not to be hard to do.

In a proposed settlement of a nationwide class-action lawsuit, the administration has agreed to scrap a decades-old practice that required many beneficiaries to show a likelihood of medical or functional improvement before Medicare would pay for skilled nursing and therapy services. Under the agreement, which amounts to a significant change in Medicare coverage rules, Medicare will pay for such services if they are needed to \u201cmaintain the patient\u2019s current condition or prevent or slow further deterioration,\u201d regardless of whether the patient\u2019s condition is expected to improve. Federal officials agreed to rewrite the Medicare manual to make clear that Medicare coverage of nursing and therapy services \u201cdoes not turn on the presence or absence of an individual\u2019s potential for improvement,\u201d but is based on the beneficiary\u2019s need for skilled care. I don't know if Bob had a hand in nudging this settlement along, but I would not be surprised if his was one of the voices calling for the change. Now we'll see how this translates to reality! Edited -- I cannot change the thread title, but I should have said 'LE treatment' instead of 'garments.' It's not clear that the story suggests garments will be covered, but indeed, this is a good change that helps Bob and others move the conversation in that direction. Log in to post a reply",

The result was a very hot airplane with low cabin pressure, for about an hour until we got to a suitable airport for landing and an aircraft change. For me, the bottom line is that I cannot count on the airplane to give me predictable, steady pressure, so I think it's best for me to be proactive and wear compression. Carol",

VICINI, M.D., F.A.C.R.) Table 2. Incidence of lymphedema stratified by surgical procedure, axillary management, and RT   Procedure Risk of lymphedema (%) Lumpectomy alone 0\u20133% Lumpectomy with SLN and breast RT 3\u201323% Lumpectomy with ALND and breast RT 1\u201361% Lumpectomy with regional nodal RT 9\u201365% Mastectomy with SLN, no RT 3\u201323% Mastectomy with ALND, no RT 30\u201347% Mastectomy with regional nodal RT 58\u201365% ALND with axillary RT 32% Radical mastectomy 58% Abbreviations: ALND = axillary lymph node dissection; SLN = sentinel lymph node; RT = radiation therapy. This study looked at credible LE risk studies over a long window of time, and as you can see from the detail above, there is no observation regarding risk of LE when the 'only' treatment is mastectomy.  Radical mastectomy risks noted are from older studies when mastectomy entailed a lot more tissue removal than is common today in our mastectomies.  My conclusion --tell me if you disagree, because I truly respect your clear interest in evidence-based analysis that you show in the LCIS discussions--is that no one has studied the question of LE risk with mastectomy alone.  If there were credible mastectomy/LE risk studies, I think Vicini et al would have included them in their meta analysis. So I am not sure how Dr. Rockson can make a general statement that with mastectomy alone, we have no need to take LE precautions.  I have LE after SNB/mx on one side, and so far, I have been allowing blood draws and BPs on my 'good' side.  But I always wonder how big the LE risk really is on the mx-only side.  There have been some interesting studies to suggest that there may be genetic predispositions to LE, which could possibly explain why some women with mx only get LE and others do not. My mother had all her nodes removed on one side with her mx 40 odd years ago, and she never developed LE, so I tend to think that in my case, the LE genetics link may not exist, and I'm probably ok with procedures on my non-SNB side. (Or I'm just rationalizing!) To Dr. Rockson I would say: please get some studies going and base your no-precautions advice on evidence! Carol",

I've never gone back to see the woman after the first post-surgical checkup (she's 3 hours away) and so I suppose I am adding to her delusion that it doesn't happen. Shah and Vicini did an exhaustive review of LE risk studies to portray the range of risk percentages associated with various treatments and combinations of treatments. The ranges of risk percentages they found quoted in study reports are enormous, because there's such variation in study design: how researchers define and measure for LE; how long they follow the patients after the procedures; how large the population is; whether there's a control group. For lumpectomy with SNB and rads to the breast, the range of LE risks 'found' by the studies Shah and Vicini reviewed was from 3% to 23%.  They found the range of risks identified for the combination of lumpectomy and nodal rads was 9% to 65%. Their report does not give a risk assessment range for the combination of lumpectomy + SNB + nodal rads (which refers to rads to the axilla, instead of to the breast and not in addition to the breast, I believe). They were looking at arm LE, which can be measured, unlike truncal or breast LE, which is diagnosed via symptoms, not measurements. I have read and may even have a study in my library somewhere, that the incidence of breast and truncal LE may be increasing with the use of SNB, because the area affected is the direct lymphatic pathway for draining the breast of lymph. But we don't see a lot of stats on that, because breast/truncal is hard to measure, so hard to study. And most women who lke you are rightly concerned about their LE risk are visualizing arm LE, because we see women or photos of women in compression sleeves, and that's what we associate with LE risk. So, you can see how easy it is for a BS who does not want to frighten us out of any kind of lifesaving treatment (or in the case of SNB, evaluation) to quote a low LE risk for SNB. There are studies to support that view.  And as to a BS's own LE outcomes, well...are they following their patients and documenting the LE incidence for at least three years?  LE risk is lifetime, but most times it surfaces within the first three years after surgery.  I sure bailed on my BS, because I did not need follow up from her and 3 hours is too far to go for a visit I don't need and don't wish to pay for. I suspect I have lots of company in not needing longer term follow up, so how can my BS have any clue what her actual LE rates are? If you want to share the study I quoted with your BS, here are the study identifiers. I don't hava a link at the moment and cannot recall where I downloaded the pdf I have. If you want the study and cannot find it, PM me and I can email it to you.

Overall, some 40% of women with BC treatments seem to get LE, and that means 60% do not. I'll bet big time that the 60% is tilted toward the women who seek information and arm themselves (no pun intended) with strategies to reduce the LE risk.  You're doing just that.  I'm looking forward to hearing what the conference was like.  Carol",

If you lift weights, it's a good idea.  If you're washing windows, maybe, because if you have a lot of windows, that's highly repetitive. If you're doing a speedy walk, I'm not so sure.  With an LE diagnosis, yes, but with no symptoms? Not so sure about that.  When you have your individual appointment you might ask for clarification on that. As to preventative MLD manual lymph drainage, aka 'massage,' I have not heard of that being recommended as standard treatment for someone not diagnosed with LE. I hope Binney or Kira or others with more knowledge than I have will comment on that. Do stay tuned in to symptoms, that's for sure! If you feel tingling, or feel a heaviness or just a persistent ache, that's a signal to seek professional evaluation.  If you exercise and get some muscle ache afterward, ask yourself if it's in only one arm, i.e. your at-risk arm, or in both.  And of course, watch for swelling.

      "Content": "Apr 23, 2013 05:02PM carol57 wrote: Today I read the studies Hildy sent me, and two study topics were particularly interesting: acupuncture and weight training. Acupuncture: There were two studies, and a variety of related articles and editorials, about acupuncture for individuals with LE. The studies' intervention periods (i.e. the weeks of acupuncture treatment) were very short and had small participation, and follow-up was just a few months. Both studies were careful to acknowledge that more rigorous research is needed, and indeed one study seems to be an exploratory study that was used to define parameters for a random controlled trial of acupuncture as LE treatment, for which enrollment is finishing up, at Memorial Sloan Kettering. In both studies, the conclusion is that administering acupuncture does not provoke any adverse LE reactions (although I think one study always administered the needles in a non-affected part of the body). Furthermore, one study noted improved quality of life from the treatment, and the other went so far as to observe measurable swelling reductions, and these reductions seemed to hold true for several weeks after treatment.  They measured only at two spots on the arm, and I don't recall any way the researchers had to control for lots of different potential LE influences and treatment factors during the weeks after acupuncture, so that study is far from perfect.  My take: it's very encouraging, and even if the random controlled trial does not find LE treatment results, preliminary results suggest that individuals who wish to use acupuncture to treat other conditions can probably do so safely.  I'll look forward to what is learned from the larger trial, and if they show that there's a lymphedema treatment benefit from acupuncture, that will probably prompt more follow-up research, and wouldn't it be great to have another tool in our LE toolbox? The weight-lifting study was very small (17 women with LE after BC) and very short. They taught the women five upper-body weight lifting exercises before the official study started, and then half the women were asked to lift very heavy weights with just a few repetitions (6-8), while the other women lifted lighter weights for more repetitions (up to 20).  They checked for any LE response after 24 hours, and then again 72 hours after the exercise session.  Then, they waited 10-12 days, and the two groups traded exercise type, so those who had lifted heavier weights now lifted lighter weights with more reps, and vice versa. They were checked again at 24 and 72 hours.  Sleeve wear was optional, and only 3 women wore sleeves during their exercise sessions.  For both forms of exercise (light weights/high reps and heavy weights/low reps), the study observed no 'significant' LE impact, using bioimpedence measures, circumference measures, and reported symptoms.  The study purpose was to find out if lifting light/hi rep vs. heavy/low rep makes a difference in the body's response to weight lifting, and they found no significant responses at all. That's their conclusion; they published a person-by-person graph that shows each woman's individual responses, and I did not take the time to study these to see the range of individual outcomes.  I'm willing to accept that the women's arms did not, indeed, flare significantly after either type of exercise, so this is encouraging and interesting. However, they note that the amount of weight each woman lifted was individualized, and the study was done with an exercise physiologist who no doubt customized the amount of weight according to each person's ability to tolerate.  Lifting light/hi reps and lifting heavy/fewer reps are both ways to work a musle to exhaustion, but I suspect that 'exhaustion' didn't happen in this study, because it would take more than one or two sessions to figure out what that maximum weight could be for each woman.  The authors acknowledge that more study is needed.   What I do find interesting in the weight lifting study is that they are questioning the need / PAL recommendation to start at the lightest possible weight when starting a lifting program. This study points out that it is well understood that the heavy/few-rep method builds muscle faster than the light/more-reps approach, and in effect they were trying to see if there's any difference in lymphedema response using one method or the other; and they found no difference. But what the study cannot do is to generalize its results to the population of women with LE after breast cancer. To say that 'Neither Heavy nor Light Load Resistance Exercise Acutely Exacerbates Lymphedema in Breast Cancer Survivor' (the title of the study report) is a very, very broad statement after testing just one session of heavy and one session of light lifting, on just 17 people! By 'acute' I think they mean 'immediate', so fair enough on the results of the women studied for that very short exercise experience during that tiny window of time. I do think that the PAL guidelines are conservative, but that's a very sound approach considering that using very light weights and working up slowly to heavier weight goes get us our strength results eventually, and few women will have an exercise physiologist or certified trainer at their side every single time they pick up a dumbbell or sit at a weight machine. Binney's concern that the study title invites generalization and dangerous advice is spot on.  Which is too bad, considering that what the study showed does indeed invite some further research to see if the helpful PAL guidelines can be tinkered with, safely, to meet the needs of lots of women who would love a speedier journey back to athletic-caliber strength, for sport and for daily work and life. But for now, I sure wouldn't recommend picking up 40 lbs or launching into a pushup or a plank or a downward dog, unless you've taken the slow-but-sure route to build the strength you need to do so! I'll issue a disclaimer that I did not take notes while reading, so my discussion points here are from memory, and it's possible I misstate a study detail or two. I read on my tiny laptop on an airplane and am typing on a tiny keyboard with a small screen...not so simple to re-read studies as I add my two cents about them here. Hildy, thanks so much for sending me these studies! Carol",

I'm convinced that wearing the sleeve offers protection, but it also helps speed up the muscle and strength development, because the muscle is working against the resistance of the sleeve. That's my experience --LE arm is notably stronger than my other, dominant arm, and you can even see the difference in the biceps size. My trainer observes the added strength, so it's not my imagination. Debra Cordner Carson, an elite CrossFit athlete who competes internationally has said the same thing about her LE leg.  No study here, of course, but that's two anecdotal cases to suggest there are more benefits to wearing the sleeve while exercising than 'just' protection.",

And a trip to a warmer climate sounds like a great way to do it.  Good for you! I don't have enough knowledge to comment on MLD during rads, so perhaps Binney, Kira or someone else with more background can weigh in on that.   The part of your post that makes me go 'hmmm,' however, is that you notice minor swelling in your left hand. Eight months after surgery that included some node removal, hand swelling most certainly could be LE. Tingling is also a sign of LE, although I think that sometimes it's also a lingering effect of node removal and does not necessarily signal LE.  But combined with hand swelling--I'd be very, very suspicious.  And the most important thought is that unless you've been evaluated by a qualified LE therapist, it's hard to imagine why your doctors are saying they are not concerned. You need a proper LE evaluation! There have not been any sound, well designed studies on whether to wear compression while flying, and it seems like most expert guidelines say 'yes' if you already have LE and 'maybe' if you don't.  In your case, you aren't diagnosed, but....might you actually have it?  I hope you'll lean on one of the docs, or your primary care MD, to give you a referral for an evaluation to find out.   You've read our various posts on this, so you probably have seen my observation that what happens to a partially-filled plastic water bottle in flight is more than enough evidence for me that significant pressure changes happen in flight, and I want to do what I can to minimize the impact of that. I would not dream of getting into an airplane, even for a very short flight, without wearing a compression sleeve and gauntlet (and you do need both, so fluid moves up the arm instead of down into the hand). As for tricks, there are a few--stay well hydrated and even in a two-hour flight, get up and walk the aisle once or twice. Put the hand up in the air, form a fist, and pump that fist twenty times, and do this every hour or so. Avoid salt. Get some exercise in (I'm a big fan of speedy walking) before and after your flight. You haven't been doing any weight training, so be incredibly careful about overloading your arm with weight, so pack lightly and if you have to lift a case or a bag, keep it quite close to the body and use both arms to lift, and use your legs to get as much of the up-and-down motion as possible. Keep in mind that ten pounds close to the body becomes a much heavier load when held away from the body. I hope you're traveling with a companion who will help with luggage!   Also, a bag strap digging into the shoulder can interrupt lymph flow, so carry bags and heavy purses on the other side.   Probably none of the above has been absolutely proven with high-quality studies, but in my view, it is common-sense to take these simple cautions, which really are not very hard to do. I've never understood any argument that says these are not worth doing. So...have you visited step up, speakout? Here's the page on finding a qualified therapist, and it's a good idea to know who's qualified before asking for a referral, so you don't waste time with someone who learned about LE in a weekend class. http://stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm And, when you get to that sunny vacation spot (which sounds wonderful to me on this snowy day where I live!), keep in mind some other precautions: sunscreen and insect repellent!  You are at risk of LE even if it does turn out that you don't in fact have it now. Both bug bites and sunburn send lymphatic fluid to the rescue, and it's certainly possible that either event could trigger swelling, or even cellulitis, which is dangerous and to which those of us with LE are pretty susceptible. Final strategy: Do what you can to reduce risks, but don't let LE or its threat stop you from living your life, so...have fun on that trip! Carol",

Many of us find that the women's have cap sleeves that cut into our sensitive underarms, and for me, the men's shirt has the perfect sleeve tightness--it's over the top of my sleeve, but not particularly compressive at that point, although I do get nice compression under the arm, the shoulder, the chest, back, etc.  Hints are to try a size one size smaller than you usually wear, and wear it inside out to keep the seams from rubbing.  I always put my compression gear on before TSA, and it's never been a problem.  Sometimes at my home airport they decide to swab it for explosive residue, but most places ignore it.  When I wear the UA shirt,  I wear a blouse or some other shirt over top of it that will cover it completely...I don't want to invite some TSA person to suggest that I have on 'outerwear' that needs to come off, because I sure don't prefer to be seen in a glove fit, skin tight shirt!  Hopefully someone using a Jovi or similar will comment on that part of your question.",

Bring your own linens and food to hospitals, for example. It's better in some other former Soviet countries, but even without LE to deal with, it's a good idea to be seen by a travel medical clinic before leaving.  The MD we met with had really done her homework and advised us on many sensible precautions; she also armed us with antibiotics (of course, that's now standard gear for me now that I have LE).  Consider getting a backpacker's filtration bottle so you can always have reliably clean water at hand.  Not just to drink, but to aid in washing should you get a scratch or a bite that you need to clean and treat to help prevent cellulitis. On flying, I'm on short, medium and long flights all the time, mostly making one connection. Water, arm movement, walking, and compression are key for me.  I had problems after flights early into my LE adventure, but since becoming more purposeful about these strategies, knock wood I don't get any major flares, just added achy feeling after some flights.  I learned the hard way to avoid repetitive arm movements and heavy lifting on the day of flight--so walking instead of arm-punching cardio exercise, no weight training those days, and great care to avoid having to heft a heavy bag with my LE arm.  In other words, avoid double- and triple-jeopardy --flying by itself adds risk, so try to minimize other risks. Oh, and I don't notice any difference in LE outcome when I fly one long flight vs. two shorter ones...which proves absolutely nothing!  In any case, I don't usually have much choice but to take connections, like Ohio, because I must use smaller airports coming and going.

They're still 'baseline' if you've had no symptoms, thank goodness!  You can find tons about what symptoms to look for at the wonderful stepup-speakout.org website, but while you're at the clinic, ask them to tell you their top warning signs. Ask what is the least symptom that warrants getting an evaluation. When would they want to see you? Ask for guidance on how to minimize the time it will take to get in that clinic, in the event you ever have symptoms. I don't know the protocols in Ontario or elsewhere in Canada, but here in the States it can literally take weeks to get on a lymphedema therapist's schedule for evaluation and treatment. If I were going to an educational event like the one you'll attend, I'd ask someone there to tell me what the process is, and how long it takes to kick into action if you get some swelling or other symptoms. Then--ask them for an insider scoop on how to make that window of time shrink a bit! You'll probably hear lots about risk reduction, like taking care of your skin and treating any cuts immediately, and many more. That's great, but I hope you'll also hear (or ask, if you need to) about any exercise or yoga programs that are available near you, that specifically tune in to helping minimize lymphedema risk. Getting stronger so that lifting heavy household items becomes easier is a common sense way to reduce the risk that lifting something heavy will trigger or worsen lymphedema. But developing that strength--getting there-- without causing LE problems can be tricky, so it's best if you can get some well trained help, if you want to pursue a fitness program that is most suited to minimize LE problems. Some cancer centers have fitness programs for cancer survivors, but they can be clueless about lymphedema risk-reduction needs. That's why I think it's smart to ask the LE clinic where they would send someone to exercise, if she's at risk of LE. Gosh, I feel like I'm rambling, but I hope some of this makes sense.  I'd love to hear what you think of the conference, if you have time in the next few days to tell us about it. Carol",

I believe we all have nodes in the part of the breast that extends closest to the armpit (one node each side I think), and I read somewhere that about 10% of women have additional nodes elsewhere in the breast.  More nodes removed = more LE risk. Ask your BS to talk more about SNB.  It doesn't necessarily mean only one node is removed.  My SNB required 5 nodes to be removed; it was explained to me that the dye traveling from my point of concern to the 'sentinel' node lit up five nodes at one time--the pathway was not sequential. They were all pathologically clear, but all needed to be checked to find that out.  I think that it is somewhat common for SNB to require multiple nodes, and of course, the more nodes, the greater your LE risk. So...be sure to also discuss with BS  the LE precautions you can take.  Request a pre-surgery baseline arm measure on that side (to facilitate the most prompt LE diagnosis if it does develop; early treatment = better outcomes and best chance the LE stays mild).  Ask BS to order arm precautions on the SNB side, even if only one node is removed (my BS didn't believe in arm precautions if 'only' an SNB and I woke up with a BP cuff on my arm).  Ask BS if he/she is up to date on LE research that suggests there's a small window of time after surgery, when lymphatics may heal. For that reason, it's best to delay for 10 days to two weeks any arm reaching, stretching, range of motion exercises that require putting that arm above shoulder level.  Studies show that waiting ten days to begin those exercises reduces LE risk and does not result in any diminished shoulder/arm capacity or ROM compared to those who do the exercises immediately after surgery. If I got the breast anatomy wrong here, I'm pretty sure someone will be by to help with better information.  Google 'tail of spence' to read about the common breast node. Best wishes, Chris.  It's great that you are questioning your LE risk before surgery. Wish I had. Carol",

With 18 nodes out you are definitely at risk for LE, but it just means that you should be strategic in how you return to Cross-Fit and any other physical activity you love to do. Here is an excerpt from stepup-speakout.org, with links to three documents you may find helpful. The second one is just a shorter version of the first one, and helpful if you'd like to send it to your MO for a little umm...re-education. The Cliff's Notes on the LE worry is that when you push your arm/trunk in ways that it is unaccustomed, the body interprets the effort as stress and sends lymph to the rescue. So the advice to re-enter gradually is meant to add resistance/repetition in doses that stay just under the 'stress' signal. You were accustomed to physical activity at a level that's well beyond many of us, and I'm pretty sure that you'll find you can progress rapidly through the slow/small increment advice you'll see in these documents. What's most important is that you learn the subtle signs of early LE, so you'll know when to back off and seek help from a qualified LE therapist. Even if you do get LE, you'll be able to do what you love, with some adjustments perhaps. I love to kayak, and I measured with a fitbit on my paddle that I do 19,000 strokes in a day on the water, often five or six days in a row. All that resistance and repetition should have sent my mild LE into watermelon-sized arm swelling, but it doesn't, I believe because I'm lifting weights in the gym regularly, so I got my arm and trunk to a point where my lymphatic system no longer feels compelled to save me from myself. Also, there's a wild card about LE risk--some of us seem to be born with robust lymphatic systems, others less so. You have no way of knowing which version you got. My mother had dozens of axillary nodes removed and had much more extensive radiation therapy than would ever be given today, so she had an armpit full of nodal dead-ends and scar tissue. She never got LE in her remaining 47 years on earth. I had just five axillary and one breast node removed, and I got it. All of which means that we cannot generalize our experiences, and knowing that some women don't get LE despite losing 20 nodes and doing world-class athletic competition does not mean another woman is any less likely to get it. But still--live your life! For inspiration, take a look here: http://games.crossfit.com/article/persistent-deborah-cordner-carson Seriously, so many women with and at risk of LE are sure lifting many more pounds than your MO thinks is our limit! Do read the following articles and just be as smart about managing your LE risk as you are when you're figuring out every teeny competitive edge when you're strategizing for cross fit meets.

One recent study estimates the number of women with breast-cancer related lymphedema to be about 800,000 in the United States today. Not all women with lymphedema benefit from wearing compression shirts, and I do not have an estimate of the number of truncal lymphedema cases, but I can tell you that every woman I know who uses compression shirts to help control truncal swelling has more than one of them. I own four Under Armour shirts, for example; two with a lighter fabric that I use when exercising, one heavy and very long one for outdoor sports, and a V-neck that I use for compression when flying on airplanes.  I also own some other shaper-type T-shirts that provide less compression than your product, but that offer the advantage of giving me a scoop neckline or a V neckline that differs from your product in that it does not hug the neck and show through much of my wardrobe. My dream Under Armour shirts would all have no internal seams, and they would offer me a choice of necklines that are not visible under a variety of clothing. The logo (as much as we love you for making these shirts) would be placed near the hem of the shirt, as currently the logo shines like a beacon where it often peeks through other, professional clothing.  I would also love to be able to buy these shirts in a variety of fabric weights, sleeve lengths, and colors. The women who are writing to you know each other via a wonderful online breast cancer support community called breastcancer.org.  If you spend a few moments reading some of the discussion threads in the lymphedema forum, you will get to know some of us.  Out of curiousity, I used the website's search tool to get a simple count of the number of mentions of the term Under Armour (I also included Under Armor...we often seem to spell it wrong): 240 times!  That's a small indicator of the number of discussions about strategies to find compression garments that meet our lymphedema needs and also fit the bill for garments that look good, are easy to care for, can be worn with a variety of wardrobe items, and sell for a reasonable price.  We do have options, but they are generally either expensive medical garments or not-quite-right shape-wear. Medical compression wear is extremely pricey and generally requires a prescription, adding to the cost and practical difficulty of acquiring it. Shapewear exists in abundance, but it usually comes with one shortcoming or another:  armhole cut too low, offering no compression just under the arm or straps that are too thin and put too much pressure on the shoulder, cutting off our lymph flow, or other functional problems. To sum, women with breast cancer related lymphedema, including me, are ready to purchase more of your terrific product, with just a few design changes.  Many thanks for your consideration of our need.\"",

Wish list for compression-fit shirts: 1) Magical seams that are flat or simply do not appear on the inside of the garment, because seams press on skin and aggravate my LE.  So, like many women here, I wear the shirt inside out. 2) Offer a version with a true scoop neck, and by that I mean, scooped enough both front and back so it can disappear under a variety of blouse, sweater, knit top, etc. necklines. It's surprising how many of my wardrobe items do not cover any of the UA shirts I own. 3) Relocate the UA logo, which tends to be front and center. I would wear an UA shirt under a jacket or cardigan, if the logo wasn't placed where the garment clearly looks like the active wear that it is. My professional attire often includes a black shell or sleeved shirt of some type under a jacket or a cardigan, and I would love to wear an UA instead. 4) Body types and sizes are all so different of course, and I cannot imagine how you design garments that work for the range of people sizes that yours do.  Having said that, when I purchase your short-sleeve compression shirts, I need to buy a men's small instead of a women's medium, because the sleeve cut or length in the women's version is way to high up under my armpit, cutting into it.  I wear the short sleeve shirts with my medical compression sleeve, and I want the UA sleeve to come as close as possible to meeting the medical sleeve. The men's shirt does the job perfectly for me, but the women's shirt does not.  So--longer sleeve in the short-sleeve shirts. Thank you sincerely for considering our needs.  I own a drawerful of UA shirts --six, I think; some with mock turtleneck for outdoor winter wear; some with your crew-type neck and long sleeves for wearing around the house or when in airplanes; and some short-sleeved for when I need to wear my compression sleeve (some women wear them all the time; I'm fortunate that I do not always need to wear it--but then I like to be in UA, which helps my truncal lymphedema in addition to helping keep my arm where it needs to be). Your product has gone a long way to helping me deal with this crazy condition called lymphedema. Carol",

I copied this from my Word doc and the numbering of paragraphs is a mess, but you'll see what is meant, anyway: What Can I Do to Lower My Lymphedema Risk During and Just after my Breast Cancer Treatment? There are steps you can take to lower your risk. You can also take steps to facilitate a very early diagnosis, should you develop lymphedema despite taking precautions. Take immediate post-surgical precautions If you are to have any lymph nodes removed (including sentinel node biopsy, which can include four or more nodes) take the following post-surgical precautions: Surgeons generally order range-of-motion exercises to commence within a day or so of mastectomy, to help prevent a painful condition called frozen shoulder. The condition is real, but several studies have shown reduced BCRL incidence if these exercises are delayed. A 2008 study compared the incidence of BCRL in women who performed immediate above-shoulder exercise with those who delayed these exercises for 7 days. The women who performed immediate exercises had nearly three times the incidence of BCRL within the first postoperative year, compared to those who waited the week. And yet at the end of that year, there were no statistically significant differences in shoulder movement, grip strength or self-evaluated outcomes between the two groups.[i] No study seems to suggest avoiding above-shoulder movement after radiation therapy, but scarring from radiation blocks the lymphatics, so common sense suggests that giving the area time to heal before stressing it may lower BCRL risk. Take steps to facilitate an early BCRL diagnosis An early diagnosis is an important risk-reduction strategy, in the sense that the earlier lymphedema is diagnosed, the more readily and easily it is treated. There is little evidence to suggest that lymphedema can be cured once it develops, but minor swelling is easier to control than is significant swelling; and controlling swelling in turn reduces the risk of disfigurement such as fibrosis, and dangerous complications, such as cellulitis.  Steps you can take include: Having baseline arm measures removes a good amount of conjecture if you notice swelling in the weeks or months following treatment. For example, if you are right-handed, your right arm may naturally have more volume than your left arm. If you have nodes removed from your right axilla, in the absence of any baseline measure, a lymphedema therapist will measure both arms and calculate the volume difference between the two. Your right arm may be larger than your left because of early lymphedema\u2014or was it always larger, because your right arm is your dominant arm?  Taking pre-treatment baseline arm measures removes that uncertainty. You will likely find that pre-treatment baseline measures are not covered by your health insurance policy. If that is the case, check your area for treatment centers or clinics that offer free lymphedema screening or baseline measures, and if not available, call around to see if you can negotiate a reduced rate for a measurement-only visit. For help finding a qualified lymphedema therapist, visit the website of Step Up, Speak Out, an organization of and for women with breast cancer related lymphedema. The site is www.step-up-speakout.org ; click on Finding a Qualified Lymphedema Therapist. The Step Up, Speak Out site also offers a downloadable document called What we Want our Healthcare Providers to Know about Lymphedema and a companion page called Essential Lymphedema Information for All Health Care Providers, both written by a physician who has BCRL. This information will give you ammunition to be a very effective advocate for taking steps to prevent, and if necessary manage, lymphedema at its most treatable stage. Know what to look for: lymphedema symptoms Keep in mind that BCRL can develop in your arm, your breast, the side of your trunk, and your back.

The axilla is a bodacious cluster of nodes, and I lost only 5, yet I got LE.  Many women here report getting LE after losing only one node.  So it's very hard for me to believe that Dr. Becker's track record is as good as she portrays. Harvesting nodes from an area that's full of them might help lower referrant LE risk, but my and others' experience certainly confirms that the loss of a seemingly trivial portion of a region's nodes can still lead to LE.  For that reason, it sure seems to me that the ethics of Dr. Becker's profession should compel her to make every effort for proper follow-up of her patients.   Like everyone else, I would dream of a sugical cure, and maybe node transfer brings that cure. But without well designed studies, it's not possible to know if the surgery's 'cure' rate is as promoted, not its risks as minimal as described.  In my view, we really want Dr. Becker, Dr. Vasile, and Dr. Massey to be the gifted micro surgeons that they are, and to apply their craft to our horrid LE problems.  But why not do it in a way that will validate the procedure and broaden the pathway for other surgeons to eventually bring it to those who would benefit?  Carol ",

It is published by the French National Academy of Surgery, called 'Reconstruction of the breast combined with treatment of lymphoedema by microsurgical transplant' (November, 2012), and she reports on 168 cases where patients had LE and subsequently received an autologous flap reconstruction, and where they also transferred inguinal nodes to the axilla.  The reported results demonstrate what she calls an LE cure in only 75% of the cases; the other 25% continue to require regular lymphatic drainage. There's mention of more widespread improvement in the frequency of infection, but meaningful swelling reduction seems to extend to only 75% of the cases in her study. Dr. Becker notes that the most successful outcomes occur when the transplants are done for patients who have early-stage LE (which she characterizes as developing within a few months of their mastectomy/ALND).  Two parts of the study report pose big questions for me: Dr. Becker does not discuss any side effects or complications at all, with no mention of including any surveillance of those side effects in her research; and she states that the patient follow-up took place at 6 months, 12 months, and 'at minimum' 3 years after transplant surgery.  That does not mean that there has been no longer-term follow-up, but I would have hoped to see some kind of analysis of the long-term results beyond 3 years, since some of the study subjects had their transplants as far back as 1991. The results she describes include: Three weeks post-op, the arm softens and loses some volume. Results showed a reduction of 2 cm (circumference) per month, on average, with volume normalization within 2 years for moderate edemas in 75% of cases. The other cases experienced improvements. (But she does not describe the extent of the improvements.) Imaging studies show that after node transfer, for 50% of patients the transplanted nodes are visible, and new lymphatic vessels have formed and are visible. For 25% of patients, new lymphatic vessels are visible, but the transplanted nodes are not. In the remaining 25%, neither new vessels nor transplanted nodes are visible, which (in her words) 'suggests failure of the intervention, knowing however that lymphatic imaging can sometimes be difficult to interpret.' Physical therapy with lymphatic drainage was stopped between 6 and 12 months post-op for 75% of cases, corresponding to the cases where imaging showed new lymphatic vessels. (Disclaimer: The article is in French, and these excerpts are my own translation.) For those of you who have the opportunity to see Dr. Becker, it would be a great service to the rest of us who are watching node transfer surgery results with great interest, if you could ask her if this and other studies that report on efficacy/LE reduction outcomes also had a complication surveillance component, and if so, where she might have published those results.

It works so well that I'm able to make artisan bread that requires are super-wet dough, and nothing sticks to the cotton glove, nor does any moisture or flour get through to my gauntlet.  So I'm sold on cotton gloves.  Like Binney, sometimes I use an old gauntlet and get it wet, but if I had the option to cover my gauntlet in a way that does not cause my hand to sweat, I would really like that option.  Perhaps  the Sealskins will do the trick, and when I find some, I'll be sure to report back.

If there are issues with gloves not fitting correctly, customers can call Farrow. However, to some degree the company's hands are tied, but they will do what they can.  Here is what the executive means by 'hands are tied.'  I found this email explanation, which I was given permission to post here, very eye-opening: Customer returns are generally handled by resellers and we TRY to be flexible with them in terms of returns.  We do have a warranty in place currently.  This is a little problematic because there are patients that purposely damage products near the end of the warranty period so that they can get a free new garment, so language about what constitutes wear and tear must be added.  We had a patient try to return garments after it looked like their dog chewed on the garment, literally, with large tooth holes and gravel embedded in the garment. Anyway, to answer your question directly with regards to returns on garments:  We do accept returns on OTS garments, BUT generally on the condition that the product has not been \u201cworn.\u201d  I say this because really once a patient, and especially one with drainage coming from their limbs, puts on a garment it is potentially contaminated with dangerous bacteria, so we really cannot safely restock these for use on other patients.  So, this is a call the reseller must make and we try to support them as best we can.  So, we do accept returns, but the product must not be \u201cworn,\u201d (contaminated) and there is a restocking fee to the reseller because of costs that we then incur as a result.  (A very few dealers in the past have ordered multiple OTS sizes for a particular patient, then try them ALL on that patient, and then returned the rest to us and did this routinely.  As I hope you are beginning to see, this is quite problematic for us).  Even with this policy, we find that some returns arrive contaminated and must be completely discarded so we lose all the costs associated with making that garment.  This isn\u2019t like a normal product at a store that can be returned and resold. For custom products:  All arm garments are custom products.  We do not offer returns of custom products because 1. They are likely contaminated, as stated above, 2. they absolutely cannot be returned to inventory because they are custom sized and they are considerably more costly for us to make (not to mention expensive for the reseller/fitter in terms of their time), 3. we wholesale these products to a reseller.  If the reseller does not accept the return, we could only return the wholesale portion anyway, 4. in part this is also because in the past a very few resellers have been somewhat irresponsible and abused the privilege of returns being lax in getting US accurate measurements and then expecting US to eat the costs associated with their lax measurement standards, and they did this on a routine basis, 5. also, customer patients have tried this as well.  They have ordered CUSTOM products from different companies at the same time, have those delivered to them, then pick which one they think they like best, and then cause the others to be returned and only pay for the one they chose.  If custom products are returnable, what would stop everyone from doing this?  Even if this were acceptable for OTS products, it is really not acceptable for custom products because it is expensive and unfair not only to the manufacturer and reseller, but eventually also to other customers because the cost would eventually have to be passed on to other patient/customers.   Our policy to all of our direct customers has been in place for quite a few years and as far as I am aware is uniform across the industry with rare exceptions.  We do occasionally make exceptions, but there must be exceptional circumstances AND a request from our reseller (direct customer) to do so.  If you know of other compression garment manufacturers that have a written policy that is different, I would like to see it.  I hope this makes our position clear.  We are always open to suggestions to make the process better for EVERYONE. So...it sure makes sense to work with dealers (and fitters) who have good, up-and-up relationships with the garment makers, and clearly Brightlife is in that group. As the Farrow executive points out, a few dealers and fitters who do not do their jobs, plus a very few patients who have tried to game the system, mean that the garment makers must protect themselves with what can feel like rigid policies.  My contact at Farrow, a very kind individual who really does care about patients, told me that he is grateful that he was able to learn about the patient issues described here. We had a very productive conversation about both LE patients' and garment makers' frustrations.  I do believe that Farrow customer service reps are following this thread, so ladies, we certainly can make positive suggestions here for how Farrow and other garment makers  might help us avoid, and if necessary deal with, the 'it doesn't fit' problem, in a way that is fair all around.  I don't think there will ever be a perfect answer--but thank you, Purple, for opening the discussion.",

I'm fairly confident that he will let me know when they have black gloves that feel and fit the same as the other colors. Here's a question about everyone's experience with LymphDivas sleeves. I have one set of sleeve and gauntlet, and I absolutely love the fabric.  But I bought the sleeve with the silicone diamonds on it, and of all the sleeves I own, this is the one that I cannot prevent the top of the sleeve from rolling when I'm very active, and after a time it forms what I fear is a tourniquet effect.  So, I don't wear it while exercising, which is a shame, because the fabric is lighter and seems to wick better than my Juzo or my Jobst sleeves.  I have silicone dots on my Juzos and have no such problem, and I wonder if the Divas problem is that the diamonds cover a lot more area under that top edge--so are they somehow preventing the sleeve from moving or stretching as needed?  Has anyone used the same size of Divas sleeve with and wtihout the silicone diamonds, and if so, do you notice any difference in how the very top of the sleeve behaves when you are active? I would love to buy another Diva sleeve to add to my exercise gear, but not if the top is going to roll as has been my experience.",

I've tried tugging it less (making it shorter) to see if that helps, but it doesn't. I've always wondered if a version without the silicone diamonds is less likely to roll, so perhaps some of you who use Divas with no diamonds can comment.  I do find that when I wear an UnderArmour shirt over the sleeve (short-sleeve men's version), the UA sleeve overlaps the Diva by a couple of inches, and it's not tight, but it seems to give just enough friction to keep the Diva sleeve from rolling.  But if I wear the Diva sleeve with anything else, i.e. normal clothing, it rolls.  The rolling is very limited--it's not like it comes down an inch or so.  But since the UA keeps it from rolling, I save my Diva sleeve for when I'm exercising and need the UA, too, which is generally when I'm lifting weights in the gym.  The Diva sleeve feels like a lighter material than my Juzos or Jobsts or Allegros, so I like it better when exercising, anyway, as it tends to sweat up a bit less.

She asked 'what happened to your arm?' out of genuine concern. Well, I completely forgot about my arm wrestling line...took the time to explain LE instead.  I'm with Binney on the longer term need to give much greater voice to LE, and I agree with her that these kinds of education opportunities can be an important part of that.",

If it does not fit, Brightlife will take it back without issue, and even though we have to pay to send it back, it's a tiny, light item so postage is minimal. You CAN do this gma.  I have no comment on wrapping, because I've never done it, as my LE is very mild and sleeve + MLD + exercise and a night garment are my management tools.  I know it's a challenge to wrap, and to endure the wrapped feeling, and I think some others will chime in to say how they deal with it.  You've been mighty persistent through your whole LE journey, so just keep digging deep to find your strength to continue.",

But it also means the sleeve gives us a tight spot at the wrist, which raises the risk --maybe even encourages--fluid to get trapped in the hand.  Here's an article about it, by Dr. Andrea Cheville, who is a physician and researcher specializing in LE:  http://www.lymphedivas.com/handprotection.asp.  So wearing a gauntlet is actually preventative.  And totally stinks...I've got mine on as I type this, and geeze does it make me make typing errors!",

Then shook my head as I realized I had intended to put that one on my right, over-moused hand. And when I put it on my right hand, it felt noticeably looser than it had felt a second before, on my LE arm.  I have no swelling in my hand, at least that I can detect, and all my LE aches are in my upper arm and around my elbow. So now I'm wondering if I can feel added lymph that I cannot see and should consider moving to a glove from the gauntlet.  If I go to see my local CLT, she will measure but find nothing and send me home, so it's a DIY question. Do we suspect that the feel of the gauntlet could be an accurate signal of subtle swelling?",

Today I shopped for shapewear camis and bought one large enough to hold me up without constriction below the breast, but not so snug as to be very compressive. Have it on now and find it already much better than a bra, and I think it is not likely to cause issues between now and next Wednesday when I see the PS to ask the compression question. I'm about an hour from any of several qualified LE therapists, so making calls to find out which might have truncal experience, and hopefully will also have seen some diep patients.  I truly do not know if I have truncal LE, but I am on a path to find out.  NatsFan, your story makes me wonder even more...some days my midriff swells to 2 or 2.5 inches more than in the morning, and it's hard to imagine that's just post-surgical swelling, because it comes and goes. FORTUNATELY, I am able to wear standard clothing, so long as I'm picky about getting some stretch in the fabric. I do hop into workout pants when not being seen in public, however! I am so looking forward to some answers and I'll be sure to post what I learn from my PS and the LE therapist.  Hoping whichever I select will put me on the calendar for late next week, pending the PS referral. I have to fly the week after I see the PS (work), and flights will be multiple and long, so I do hope to have that first LE consultation before that.  With PS permission on compression, I plan to follow Binney's suggestion and wear an Under Armour shirt one size too small, inside out. Thanks again to all who posted, and I'll update with what I learn next week. Carol",

I do not perceive any swelling.  Doc confirmed what I knew from reading-that a 5% difference is considered likely LE. But then he said he doesn't think I have LE, because there are no other physical signs of it.  As to my comes-and-gos-moves-around breast and midriff swelling, he confirmed that he sees truncal from time to time, and he gives it a 'maybe' for me. But he thinks my symptoms could just as easily be persistent post-surgical swelling (tomorrow = 15 weeks post op).  I am DELIGHTED if this is not LE, and I am quite happy to have arm measures that while not pre-surgery baseline, serve that purpose in contemplation of my return to strength training.  He also answered my query about risk of liposuction (part of diep stage II scheduled for December, and desirable because I have some noticeably odd aspect to one breast that should be fixed with fat transfer fills). I wanted his opinion on added LE risk from midriff lipo, and he gave me green light on that: midriff is not an area where lymph flow is concentrated; skin is intact so dermal flow will not be interrupted, where the two primary reasons he felt the lipo would not add LE risk.  What I wanted to hear, of course, but really?  Should I be suspicious that he isn't seeing LE on a 10% arm volume difference?  Or is he very wise to wait and see? He wants to see me again in 3 months for follow-up measures. Doc also stated that LE is rarely a complication of tissue-transfer reconstruction--more likely the result of the underlying breast surgery, especially with node removal.  Eyebrow-raiser?  I thought I read that LE incidence seems to be higher with growing use of tissue transfer. The clinic in question is (per clinic website) 'one of four National Lymphatic Network centers in the country that is both a diagnostic and treatment center, offering patients a full continuum of care and expertise.'   The doc's expertise is in wound care, according to his bio. He was quite caring and spent a lot of time with me, listening carefully. And he sure had patience and good humor in response to my long list of questions. I was very encouraged when I asked how many presurgery arm baseline measures they do for surgical patients in their hospital system, and he said 'lots, but we still have more education to do on that.' At least that says something about progress this center is making on patient education. I was hoping for clarity on possible truncal, and I'm aware that it's hard to diagnose, so not surprised that I have a 'maybe' answer. But I thought perometer-measured arm differences provided a more certain answer.  Everyone's thoughts? Carol",

Her estimate is that 40% of women who have breast cancer treatment will develop LE during their lifetimes.  If one in eight women in the US gets breast cancer, that suggests that about 5% of women will get LE related to breast cancer.  Five of every hundred women is a bit hard to imagine.  But keep in mind that a lot of LE is breast and truncal LE, which won't often have a person in an arm sleeve.  So the 'badge' of LE isn't there. Many women don't wear sleeves all the time. I'm in the group that only wears the sleeve during heavy activity and while flying, because my symptoms are mild and I find that using a Tribute night garment works so well that it seems to keep swelling at bay during the day (knock on wood!). Even so, it's a good puzzle for why we're not seeing people with LE around us.  ",

Best circumstance is to work with a personal trainer who is familiar with the PAL Protocol, if you can find one.  Research suggests there's no upper limit on weight you can lift with your SNB arm, but form, method, progression and lots of attention to precautions govern how successfully you can manage your LE risk while moving toward your weight goals. Good luck--I'm right there with you with the same objective and the same concerns!  Carol",

It's perhaps not so much that heat and humidity trigger lymphedema, more that you have latent/ early stage lymphedema already, and heat/humidity triggers the initial swelling.  Gma is right that manual lymph drainage is the tool you need to help nudge that lymph outta there.  Try for the therapist, do whatever you can to make that happen, because nipping it in the bud will help.  Are you wearing the sleeve?  Often, early stage LE swelling will resolve overnight and with breathing/elevation etc., but you'd want to be in that sleeve during waking hours to keep it from coming back, especially if dealing with heat and humidity.  If the swelling persists, a therapist would wrap you and show you how to wrap so you can continue the process-wrapping with LE bandages brings down swelling and it's probably the best way to combat LE when you get back in the airplanes for the return trip home.  But it's not a YouTube learning bit--needs to be done in a way that's appropriate to your swelling location, and there's real technique to it.  Therapist access is key, and it stinks, stinks, stinks that you find yourself needing that kind of help when you're on vacation away from home with an itinerary that keeps you moving.  Wishing you some better luck soon!

But like all the other plastic surgeons who are doing lymph node transfers, they're incredibly short on serious information about surgical results and they're not saying a peep about real peer-reviewed research that would include long-term patient followup and transparent reporting of findings. Personally, I'm pretty disgusted by surgeons' websites that say or hint at 'research' or 'clinical trials' pertaining to node transfer, because no matter how deep we dig in the clinicaltrials.gov website, we come up with zilch. Oh, there's one 'clinical trial' sponsored by an organization owned by Dr. Marga Massey, but when you look at the clinicaltrials.gov status on that 'trial,' it's a whopping zero report. Call me cynical, but I think there's a lot of marketing of lymphatic surgery as a means to attract reconstruction business. I'm grumpy today because my LE arm is bugging me and my diep breasts are puffy, too...truncal LE....I'd love to think that there's a miracle surgical cure out there, but we wouldn't know if a miracle cure were devised, because nobody's setting up success criteria or sharing any results! Whatever 'good degrees of success' are, somebody in node transfer surgery should really take the time to explain. End of rant. Sorry... Carol",

Today I talked with one of the LE therapists on my list of qualified therapists in my area. This therapist is LANA certified. I shared with her my wish to find a therapist who is familiar with truncal LE, because that is where I am experiencing symptoms that make me want to get an evaluation. She assured me she has truncal experience. She asked if I have any swelling of the arms, and I told her that no, I have swelling only in the diep flaps and in the midriff area, and that it comes and goes. Then...she patiently explained to me that lymphedema is a condition of the extremities, and that to have truncal LE, there must also be involvement of the extremities. So, she explained, it's important to understand that I might legitimately have swelling as a consequence of my surgeries, but not all swelling is LE, and if there's no arm involvement, I do not have LE. She assured me that there are ways to help with non-LE swelling.  In truth I have no idea if I really do have LE or if I am still experiencing post-surgical (temporary) swelling, and that's why I want an evaluation--catch it early if it IS lymphedema. However, if the condition persists long-term, I'm wondering if my insurance will cover extended treatment if there's not an LE diagnosis. So, three questions for those of you who have become LE experts: 1) Does the 'must also involve extremities' logic make sense?  2) Does anyone have experience with persistent non-LE swelling and insurance coverage for treatment without an LE diagnosis? 3) How long might you imagine non-LE post-surgical swelling to continue? I have assumed that post-surgical swelling would be a constant, perhaps reducing gradually over time, but not coming and going as I am experiencing.  Sometimes I pick up about 2\" in my midriff during the course of the day, and each morning I wake up with no swelling at all. Tomorrow marks 11 weeks since the bmx/diep. Thanks for any insights on any of the above. Carol",

Do your swelling and the internal pressure come and go?  I went to my LE evaluation yesterday straight from the airport after flying all morning, and I had worn an Under Armor compression shirt during the flights, at the suggestion of Binney and others. That really does work --I fly every week now, and before I started wearing the shirt, flying was causing immediate and very uncomfortable internal pressure feelings such as you describe. But maybe my flight precautions somehow sabotaged my LE eval, because despite the perometer-measured arm volume differences, while in the clinic I had none of the other comes-and-goes swelling or pressure feelings. This is so discouraging, because now that the physician to whom I went for evalutation has NOT given an LE diagnosis, my insurance will not cover treatment. On the LANA-certified question, when I started my search for the best place to go for an evaluation, the first thing I did was look for a LANA-certified therapist.  I called the only LANA-certified therapist within two hours of home, and we talked about my symptoms over the phone. She pretty much stated that there's no such thing as truncal lymphedema; that it must have arm involvement. That didn't sound like someone who was going to take my breast feelings and my midriff swelling too seriously, so it prompted me to go to the 'NLN Center' about an hour away (where, by the way, none of the therapists is LANA-certified!). So now I do know that perometer-measured differences in arm volume have been documented, so I imagine the therapist that needed to see some kind of arm involvement would talk to me about breast and midriff swelling now.  But the physician providing LE care says I don't have LE. I call this an insurance mess in the making.  My stage two in December will include nipple reconstruction, too, so you've given me a good heads-up on the compression problem.  I have found that wearing a shaper cami or bodysuit works better than wearing a bra--seems to help reduce the frequency of my breast/midriff swelling. So you've reminded me that that particular strategy isn't going to be available after stage II. How long are you expecting it to be before you can use compression again? Thank you so much for sharing your experience and calling it the way you see it. I'll be talking to my insurance case manager today or tomorrow to see if I can get a little empathy on this, and an agreement for a second opinion.   I can guess why your screen name is 'toomuch.'  I feel like I should change mine to 'too frustrating' !

I'd be wary of a velcro closure on anything you'd put in the same room with your beautiful Farrow glove!  Pesky velcro reaches out and grabs compression wear quite maliciously. Hugz, darn it anyway, I had such high hopes for the sealskinz.  On the UK home site, there are versions without the grippers, but I don't find all of them online here. Cindy, thank you for the additional resources for us to check out! I've a mind to write to LLBean, that wonderful company in Maine, to see if they might help out with a gore-tex glove that meets our needs.  They sell lots of things made of it, and perhaps they might help us out with some contacts to explore more possibilities.",

Victoria, you are so right about moderation.  I thought perhaps your sleeve covers were compressive in themselves, and the wrinkles at the wrist could be trouble.

Here's a pump: http://www.outdoorgearlab.com/Backpacking-Water-Filter-Reviews/Katadyn-Hiker-Pro  These things are very small and lightweight so very packable. It sounds like your water will be pretty dirty, so you might need to bring some coffee filters --read the article I linked to, which explains using those. And, to double hedge your bets, you could also drop some purifying tabs into the water (http://www.outdoorgearlab.com/Backpacking-Water-Filter-Reviews/Aquamira-Water-Treatment-Drops). We camp from our kayaks for a week each summer, drinking river water through filter bottles as we paddle. For camp time at night, we use a pump system to fill up our cooking and wash pots.  I've taken my filter bottle to Moldova, where I'm told nearly all the groundwater (hence wells) is contaminated with 'stuff' and giardia, and in a two week visit nothing nefarious happened! You should be able to use the miracle of Amazon to get filtration bottles/pump in a day or so, if this idea appeals to you and you can find a few more inches of space in your bags.  Or at any camping outfitter store. Sounds like you're off to a very interesting place, where people maybe do not have much of what we take for granted, and despite the trouble with your LE garments, experiences like that do tend to help us count our blessings and put even BC and LE in better perspective.  Best wishes for a safe trip that rewards you in whatever ways you're hoping for.

I had an a-ha moment this morning regarding the LE hand.  The past few days, all the keyboarding has been brutal on my arm, so I decided to face reality and wear sleeve/gauntlet every waking hour, plus my Tribute while sleeping, so 24-hour compression.  Usually I wear day compression only when I'm active. This morning as I was typing, my wedding rings were bugging the heck out of me, because they were too loose and the stone was sliding between my fingers. I took them off, and then it hit me: first time in memory that the rings were loose, except when frigid cold last winter! I have lost about fifteen pounds since last summer, so by rights the rings should be a bit loose, and I think I now know that I do indeed have some swelling in the hand, which I apparently can control using steady compression. So my hunch on the different feel of the gauntlet--looser on the non-LE hand--may be correct.  Now I just need to do some experimenting and note taking, as Binney suggests, to see if there's a time-of-day influence I'm not accounting for.  ",

What saddens me most is that here we have some incredibly gifted microsurgeons working on what might well turn out to be the cure we'd all love to see, but they are not sharing information in a way that would help them build on each others' experiences. Dr. Becker has made it clear that she considers the work of sharing her records a waste of time, and she arguably has the most information to share, if she were willing to do so. The surgeons working on vascular bypass solutions seem to be working independently, too. The National Lymphedema Network will have its big research conference in fall of 2014, and I'm hoping that the whole group of LE surgeons will show up and have a roundtable discussion.

And the survey: There are all kinds of symptom quizzes on all kinds of conditions, ending with 'see your doctor if you scored high'.  Is this survey available anywhere as a way to nudge women to do their own initial screening (or confirm/deny their initial suspicions)?  If only 18.5% of patients with LE diagnosed by the survey discussed their symptoms with their PE, is it because they don't think what may be minor symptoms are a big deal, or they simply haven't seen anyone who might tell them that what they are feeling may have a name and they should get evaluated?  I am where I am in my LE discovery journey because I'm using a very unscientific survey--asking questions on an LE forum.  I might have sped up my discovery (and had a more adamant discussion with yesterday's MD)  if I had a survey instrument that led to a 'hey, get this checked out' recommendation.   But this survey is used only in formal research?

I strongly suspect that you're experiencing post-surgical sensations, but it's a good reminder to think of LE and get some baseline measures so you'll have a good comparison in case you feel the classic hallmark LE sensations in your arm: a feeling of heaviness; maybe some tingling; perhaps a low-grade burning feel. Also--jewelry too tight, and you haven't gained weight. For truncal LE, look for more pronounced bra marks on your surgery side, and the same low-grade burning feeling. If you're lucky, you may find that an LE clinic in your area puts on screening-and-education sessions. That's the ideal, but if need be, ask for a referral for an evaluation by a qualified LE therapist, who should do the baseline measures and talk to you about smart strategies to minimize your risk of getting LE going forward. Best wishes--and warm hugs, too--take care and stay hydrated as you recover from your surgery.",

Wow and double-wow to those who take the big step and try a surgical solution. I would not be that brave! One of the biggest concerns that many of us have is that the community of surgeons performing LE-related surgery is not doing so very transparently...there's no seeming platform to track patient outcomes on a long-term basis and pool information about results, and then make that information available to patients, researchers and other surgeons and healthcare providers. So, you could do us all a great service if you ask Dr. Chang about his follow-up and his protocol for sharing his patients' results so that others might benefit. I know that your meeting with him needs foremost to focus on your needs, and I would not be at all surprised if Dr. C responds well...cool-ly to a question about patient outcomes and tracking. But if you are comfortable asking about this, I think there are many LE patients who would be quite grateful to learn of his answer. As a member of NLN's Lymph Science Advocacy Program, I have been fortunate to hear several surgeons' presentations and to watch a debate on this topic (surgeon 'for' and surgeon suggesting restraint). I've asked Dr. Massey and Dr. Granzow questions about patient follow-up and data sharing, receiving the brush-off in return. I'm not sure why they're on the defensive about this, but they are (I've never met Dr. Chang nor seen him speak, however). Knowledge really is power, as Trisha says, and women should not have to speculate about outcomes such as the nature of garment wear/frequency following surgical treatment. Certainly there have not been enough surgeries of the various kinds to have statistically valid predictive models, but my gosh, the information should be much more solid than what we're grasping at here. Best wishes on your meeting, and I sincerely hope that you are pleased with what you learn and that you can confidently make a decision as a result! Carol",

Most surgeons require patients to wait until drains are removed before raising the arms, so if you have to convince your surgeon about waiting to start any physical therapy that involves stretching, you're really just pushing for a few more days, generally. And not raising the arms is no guarantee you won't get LE, but if it reduces the odds, it's sure worth considering.",

That bit of rubber is textured slightly, and I found it quite easy to grasp dishes, silverware, etc. as I worked in the kitchen. The gloves are comfortable and I wore them quite a bit for kitchen work, maybe about an hour, two times, yesterday.  My work included making a pie crust, which doesn't ask much of my LE hand (left hand; I am a righty), but I was quite interested in what the fabric of the glove would look like after it was covered in wet flour during my cutting board clean-up work.  I used a bench knife to scrape the board of the damp flour, into my left hand (much as you might sweep crumbs from one  hand to the other). The glove was pretty coated in the goo, but I had no trouble rinsing it off to what looked like a brand new glove.  That made me think about what might lurk in the glove's fibers if I had been handling chicken. The outside layer of the glove is a knit fabric, and that layer does get (and stay) wet.  So, I washed my hands with anti-bacterial hand soap, with the glove on over my LE gauntlet, really lathering. I believe the glove can be washed in the machine, but that's not useful if the idea is to cut up chicken, then turn to a pile of salad greens.  I say 'believe' the glove is machine washable, because there is no comment about that on the packaging, although I know for certain that Gore-tex and other similar raingear are washable, so I suspect that's true here, too.  Anyway, the glove seemed no worse for the wear after a vigorous handwashing with the kitchen hand soap, and I have no reason to think that the anti-bac properties of the soap did not do its work.  But--probably if I had chicken or meats or seafood to work with, I would use one of the disposable plastics for that part of my kitchen work.  Just in case the glove fiber doesn't readily sanitize. That all sounds great, right?  Except...one of the fingers leaked!  My pinky tip was wet inside, which probably means that the seam was not fully sealed.  The rest of the glove was dry and snug as a bug after repeated dunkings and holding the hand under a running faucet, and the rest of my hand never got in the least bit sweaty.  But clearly a wet pinky is not what I paid for, so the glove goes back.  I'll ask for an exchange and give it a second try.  For the record, this glove would be absolutely perfect for an outdoor activity, such as skiing or nordic pole walking, where the hand might get sweaty from the warmth of the activity.  I'm hoping that I got that one odd glove with a leaky seam, but if the replacement is not fully dry, I'll have to give the product a thumbs down for LE garment protection.",

A therapist wrote in NLN's e-newsletter earlier this month that in her opinion, we should be wearing our 'night' garments (or bandages) up to 12 hours per day.   Besides the obvious problem of how to get anything done in my Tribute (like type...which is a big part of my job), I'm wondering what everyone does for clothing that's compatible with either these oven mitts on steroids, or a wrapped arm.  Do you cut off one sleeve?  At night I'm sleeping in a short-sleeved nightgown, which kinda makes me crazy because my shoulders and my unaffected arm are always too cold.  But to wear the thing earlier at night or into the morning, what kind of get-up is compatible?",

Chlorine dioxide is iodine and chlorine free. The unique formula works by releasing nascent oxygen, a highly active form of oxygen, which is a strong oxidant and a powerful germicidal agent. Chlorine dioxide has been used by municipal water treatment plants to kill a variety of waterborne pathogens since the late 1940s. Unlike free chlorine (familiar as household bleach) or other halogen chemicals (such as iodine), chlorine dioxide does not create potentially harmful by-products. I was wondering if the product would somehow bleach or harm your garment.  Take a look at their 'contact' web page--they're practically begging you to call them to explain your problem and ask if these simple little drops are part of the solution! http://aquamira.com/contact-information The Steripen may pose problems in that you need power to run it, and I think there's an issue with having the right-shaped container to stick it in.  I've never used it myself so cannot say from experience how well it works. We run our well water at the house through a multi-stage filter that ends with exposure to a UV light, so I know that UV is highly effective for water purification. I just don't know if the little pen is really easy to use and foolproof. I'd love to know what else you learn and of course, how your ultimate solution works for you on your trip! Carol",

She is pretty clear that women wearing compression to help prevent LE need to wear both, but that if you have LE, she understands that people want to experiment.  On the thumb of your Juzo gauntlet, one strategy is to put a battery in the thumb as it dries (or something of similar shape) to make it just a tiny bit bigger. It might be more comfortable. Some of my Juzo gauntlets make my thumb go numb and I have to do that. Others are fine, and they're all the same size, so I guess manufacturing is not 100% consistent.",

Several researchers have done wonderful work to identify early, early LE symptoms that are quite accurate in signaling LE before any swelling is present. Here's an excerpt that explains that, from a course about LE, for nurses (BCRL= breast cancer-related lymphedema): Diagnosing BCRL: the value of patient-reported symptoms Visible BCRL is already advanced BCRL A limb can contain 20%-30% added fluid volume before there is visible swelling, meaning that relying on measurements to detect BCRL, especially with the widely available but less sensitive tape-measure method, is likely to miss very early BCRL. Diagnosing BCRL when pre-clinical\u2014i.e. before visible swelling\u2014means diagnosing the condition at its most treatable, manageable stage. Early intervention has been shown to result in very good treatment outcomes using simple, non-custom compression garments (Stout Gergich et al, 2008). Technology exists that can detect pre-clinical BCRL (bioimpedance and perometry), but it is expensive and not widely available. However, several studies have shown that patients\u2019 self-reported symptoms are very accurate indicators of early lymphedema. Studies that tested the accuracy of self-reported symptoms as indicator of BCRL include: Key points Patients\u2019 self-reported symptoms are important indicators that medical follow-up may be needed. Questions to ask patients that might disclose early BCRL are quite simple:",

The lymph thickens and becomes even more difficult to travel through the lymphatic vessels.   If you look at the Cognacq-Jay website, you will read about complete decongestive therapy, which includes not only lymphatic drainage, but also wrapping and compression garments. Take a look here: http://www.hopital.cognacq-jay.fr/presentation/la-mission-medicale/l-approche-medicale-03.php . The description of the stages of treatment is exactly what we would find from a well qualified lymphedema therapy center here in the US. So, LE treatment in France is available that includes a comprehensive approach.  It sounds from your recent post that you have swelling in many places, so it is important that you receive an evaluation from experts who are familiar with primary lymphedema, which is not caused by injury or trauma, but rather is from being born with missing elements of the lymphatic system, and/or a genetic problem that causes LE to appear at some point in life--and it can be quite young, or quite old, or in between that the condition shows as swelling. Wow, you have a lot going on!  Wishing you the very best as you take steps to get some more comprehensive treatment. Carol",

Here is an excerpt from a document I put together for a good friend who asked the same question. I researched in these threads, and in PubMed and through tons of patient booklets, and then I wrote up all that I wish I had known before I agreed to my SNB, which was probably discretionary. If you need more, PM me and I'll send the whole document to you, including references for the studies mentioned. What Can I Do to Lower My Lymphedema Risk During and Just after my Breast Cancer Treatment? There are steps you can take to lower your risk. You can also take steps to facilitate a very early diagnosis, should you develop lymphedema despite taking precautions. Take immediate post-surgical precautions--If you are to have any lymph nodes removed (including sentinel node biopsy, which can include four or more nodes) take the following post-surgical precautions: 1. Do not allow blood draws, IVs, or blood pressure measures to be taken on your affected arm, even if the hospital staff and/or your surgeon tells you that your lymphedema risk is so low as to not warrant any arm precautions. If you have nodes removed from both arms, insist that this work be done using some portion of a leg. 2. Do not perform any exercises, including range-of-motion or \u2018wall walking' stretches that require you to lift your arms above shoulder level, for two weeks following surgery. There may be a small window of opportunity for damaged lymphatics to regenerate, and stressing the axilla by performing traditional post-mastectomy exercises is suspected to interfere with that opportunity.  Surgeons generally order range-of-motion exercises to commence within a day or so of mastectomy, to help prevent a painful condition called frozen shoulder. The condition is real, but several studies have shown reduced BCRL incidence if these exercises are delayed. A 2008 study compared the incidence of BCRL in women who performed immediate above-shoulder exercise with those who delayed these exercises for 7 days. The women who performed immediate exercises had nearly three times the incidence of BCRL within the first postoperative year, compared to those who waited the week. And yet at the end of that year, there were no statistically significant differences in shoulder movement, grip strength or self-evaluated outcomes between the two groups. No study seems to suggest avoiding above-shoulder movement after radiation therapy, but scarring from radiation blocks the lymphatics, so common sense suggests that giving the area time to heal before stressing it may lower BCRL risk. 3. Do perform exercises designed to reduce post-surgical swelling. Get your surgeon's permission, of course, but the following exercises (based on those suggested by American Cancer Society, and modified slightly in a post here that Kira wrote) are helpful during the first 10-14 days after surgery (just do not raise arms above shoulder level): a. Lie down and raise your affected arm above the level of your heart (you can bend your elbows--no reaching for recovery yet...) for 45 minutes. Do this 2 or 3 times a day. Put your arm on pillows so that your hand is higher than your wrist and your elbow is a little higher than your shoulder. This will help decrease the swelling that may happen after surgery. b. Exercise your affected arm while it is raised above the level of your heart by opening and closing your hand 15 to 25 times. Next, bend and straighten your elbow. Repeat this 3 to 4 times a day. This exercise helps reduce swelling by pumping lymph fluid out of your arm. c. Practice deep breathing exercises (using your diaphragm) at least 6 times a day. Lie down on your back and take a slow, deep breath. Breathe in as much air as you can while trying to expand your chest and abdomen (push your belly button away from your spine). Relax and breathe out. Repeat this 4 or 5 times. This exercise will help maintain normal movement of your chest, making it easier for your lungs to work. Do deep breathing exercises often. 4. Avoid sleeping on your affected arm and do not lie on that side. 5. Stay hydrated: drinking water thins the lymph (fluid), making it easier to move through the body. Take steps to facilitate an early BCRL diagnosis An early diagnosis is an important risk-reduction strategy, in the sense that the earlier lymphedema is diagnosed, the more readily and easily it is treated. There is little evidence to suggest that lymphedema can be cured once it develops, but minor swelling is easier to control than is significant swelling; and controlling swelling in turn reduces the risk of disfigurement such as fibrosis, and dangerous complications, such as cellulitis. Steps you can take include: 1. Before your surgery or radiation treatment starts, request a referral to a certified lymphedema therapist or another individual who is qualified to take arm measurements designed to assess lymphedema. This individual must know and routinely use lymphedema arm-measurement methods. Request baseline measures of both of your arms-before starting breast cancer treatment. Having baseline arm measures removes a good amount of conjecture if you notice swelling in the weeks or months following treatment. For example, if you are right-handed, your right arm may naturally have more volume than your left arm. If you have nodes removed from your right axilla, in the absence of any baseline measure, a lymphedema therapist will measure both arms and calculate the volume difference between the two. Your right arm may be larger than your left because of early lymphedema-or was it always larger, because your right arm is your dominant arm? Taking pre-treatment baseline arm measures removes that uncertainty. You will likely find that pre-treatment baseline measures are not covered by your health insurance policy. If that is the case, check your area for treatment centers or clinics that offer free lymphedema screening or baseline measures, and if not available, call around to see if you can negotiate a reduced rate for a measurement-only visit. 2. Know the signs of lymphedema that you can feel, but not see. Women with BCRL will often notice a feeling of heaviness, tingling, a pins-and-needles sensation, or sometimes a feeling of warmth in an affected arm, long before swelling is visually evident. Fluid volume in an arm can increase some 30% before added volume is even measurable, and yet that is just the time when lymphedema treatment, including manual lymph drainage and compression therapy, can be most effective in holding BCRL at its most mild and controllable stage. 3. Be your own strongest advocate and insist on evaluation by a qualified lymphedema therapist if you suspect you have lymphedema. Women with BCRL report anecdotally that their oncologists, radiologists and surgeons are not always quick to distinguish post-surgical symptoms from early lymphedema, so you may need to press the issue. An experienced lymphedema therapist can often identify early lymphedema through very subtle symptoms that your cancer treatment team is not accustomed to working with. For help finding a qualified lymphedema therapist, visit www.step-up-speakout.org ;click on Finding a Qualified Lymphedema Therapist. For help making your doctors understand what you need, you will also find a downloadable document called What we Want our Healthcare Providers to Know about Lymphedema and a companion page called Essential Lymphedema Information for All Health Care Providers, both written by a physician who has BCRL. This information will give you ammunition to be a very effective advocate for taking steps to prevent, and if necessary manage, lymphedema at its most treatable stage. At SU-SO, you will also discover tons of help in recognizing the visible signs of LE, and help understanding how LE is treated, how to know if compression garments fit properly, and lots more. Good luck to you!! And tell us what else you learn, as you continue to prepare yourself. (for some reason I cannot get the page to insert the suso link...but I'm sure you can find the site!) Carol",

It seems we help each other the most by pooling our information, and I'm glad to contribute when I can. I'm glad you'll be seeing the physio, and I hope you'll be candid with him or her in asking about experience with LE.  Here in the US some of our LE community have had unfortunate experiences with PTs who have no LE training. For example, using therabands (resistance elastic bands) is standard therapy for lots of injuries, but they're generally not a good idea for LE patients (or those at risk, many believe) because it's not possible to measure the amount of resistance and increase it slowly in small increments. A PT who is also trained in LE would find other ways to add resistance, such as low-weight dumbbells or weight machines set to very low resistance. Or at least work with the patient to be incredibly aware of the need to add resistance very cautiously and slowly. Good luck on Thursday and let us know how the meeting goes.  Carol",

In summer, if the heat in Bordeaux is horrid, you can escape by going to the spa where it should be cooler, no?  One thing to be prepared for is that most of us find that at higher altitudes, we tend to swell more.  But that's in all seasons, of course, so I'd be tempted to schedule the trip for maximum heat relief time.  I assume that the spa's experts in LE are well equipped to show you how to deal with any altitude-related LE flares. If you write a blog, I'll bet lots of us would be fascinated to read about your experiences when you go! Carol",

I had SNB, which in my case meant 5 nodes went out (ask for that info if you've never been told it was literally just one node).  I sought an LE evaluation from a lymphedema clinic at about 4 months post-op (bilateral mastectomy with immediate diep reconstruction). I was worried about swelling and tender feelings under my armpit, running down the trunk a bit, and that's what I wanted evaluated.  The clinic uses a perometer (a very sensitive measuring device) and wanted to measure both my arms as standard procedure; there is no way to measure for truncal or breast LE, but they wanted to screen me for arm LE.  I was sure I did not have it in my arm, because I saw zero swelling.  Well, to my surprise the Perometer measured my SNB arm at just over 10% more volume than my other arm, and by rights it should have been smaller, because the SNB arm is my left, and I am right handed.  SO, I had swelling that I could not see with my eyes, and LE there without realizing it.  It is said that we can have up to  20-30% extra fluid in a limb before swelling is visible.   I'm not trying to spook you--truly the risk is lower with SNB compared to axillary dissection, but the studies that say the risk is 1% to 3% are not necessarily good studies; LE studies are difficult to interpret, because they often limit the follow up period to 6 months or a year, when our risk is much longer than that; there is no standard measurement criterion for a lymphedema diagnosis--some studies use 5% volume difference from one arm to the other; some use 10%; some use a 2 cm circumferential difference at one of four points on the arm; some use a 5 cm combined differential measuring at multiple points, etc. Measurement technology is not standard, either.  So we have a bunch of studies that are apples and oranges and do not test each other --i.e. try to repeat an earlier study's conclusions--because no one has established standards for study design.  Some studies put the LE risk with SNB as high as 15-17%; others as low as 1%.   My conclusion from the study problems is that we need to educate ourselves about LE risks and know what the symptoms are, so we can get help asap if something develops.  One thought to you is to get a referral to a qualified LE therapist, as someone else suggested, and not only get evaluated, get some baseline arm measurements now, on both arms.  The therapist will do that as part of the evaluation, but ask for help to create your own set of measurements, at body landmarks on your arms such as moles that do not move, so you can be sure that you're able to measure yourself at the same spots each time you check.  And then check ever so often, and write down your measurements. If you see a difference, call the therapist and get re-evaluated. For accurate, evidence-based information about LE, take some time to investigate all the many amazing info pages here:  www.stepup-speakout.org.  Last thought:  LE is annoying, makes us crazy, can be uncomfortable, and you kinda have to wear it on your sleeve, so to speak.  But it does not have to rule your life.  I'm more active than I ever was; about to hop in a kayak for an afternoon of paddling and generally do what I want, but mindful of some guidelines for not aggravating the LE.  We can answer all your questions about those considerations, but for now, I hope you'll focus on getting a proper evaluation, and your surgeon should really help you with a referral for that, to an appropriately qualified therapist.  The stepup-speakout site has a page all about finding one! You're asking all the right questions, so with persistence you'll find what you need.  Best of luck, and keep us posted on how you are doing. Carol ",

Since you had cellulitis on your lower back, it seems possible that nodes lost during your reconstruction are causing you trouble now. Your SNB arm is distant, so hopefully you'll luck out and LE will not trouble you in the upper body, but you'll want to make sure that the LE therapist you consult understands the nature of your recon surgeries. Typically flap recons remove some lymph nodes, and your flaps came from a few spots.  I'd especially want someone who either understands gap and diep, or is willing to learn, and who can help you do what's possible to minimize risk of lymphedema migrating to your legs.  I think it's not a 100% given that a cellulitis bout means you definitely have LE, but cellulitis is known to be a trigger for it.  Get the best therapist you can find, and consult a specialist MD if you're not sure you're getting the help you need.  In Princeton, you are within shooting distance of Dr. Kathleen Francis, who is an MD specializing in LE and who is on the National Lymphedema Network medical advisory board.  She's in greater NYC, as is Bonnie Lasinski, a very well regarded PT/ LE therapist who is also affiliated with NLN.

Well, that's my none-too-scientific description of what the pump is doing.  Your swelling in your lower back may signal LE, and if so, you'll find it's a challenge to do manual lymph drainage yourself--I suspect when you're able to see a therapist, he/she will suggest a helper, such as a husband,  because you'd have difficulty reaching that area yourself. A pump does most of the work for you, but I do not know if it can be configured to work on the trunk, back, etc.  More than a few women in the LE forum use pumps, so probably someone who uses one will give a more accurate description and explain what it does, and what it cannot do.",

Cellulitis is indeed sometimes a trigger of lymphedema, so you'll want to be watching and feeling for early LE symptoms as your infection heals and beyond:  feeling of heaviness, general achiness, slight burning feeling, and of course any swelling in your limb, including your hand. Here's the stepup-speakout resource on diagnosing LE, which gives more information about symptoms: http://stepup-speakout.org/diagnosing_lymphedema.... With six nodes removed, your risk is small, but not trivial. As kicks said, a certified lymphedema therapist is the best resource for knowing what to do to minimize your risk of getting LE.  If you're lucky enough to have a lymphedema clinic that puts on educational classes, perhaps they would be available for a quick phone call to ask for advice on when it's safe to re-start your stretching and rehab work.",

      "Content": "Sep 18, 2012 09:53PM - edited Sep 25, 2012 06:47AM by carol57 Pamela, one strategy is to make sure no one has you doing any exercises or stretches above shoulder level, for at least one week following your surgery.  A random-controlled trial led by Jacquelyn Todd had two groups of patients: all with axillary dissection, and half followed the traditional program of immediate post-surgery shoulder mobilty exercises (like 'wall walking'), and the other half waited 7 days before starting these exercises.  The  'immediate' group had 2.7 times the incidence of LE by the end of one year, compared to the group that delayed exercises.  Both groups has the same physical outcome at the end of that year, in terms of shoulder and arm mobility, so they demonstrated that waiting the week reduces LE incidence without impairing physical function. So--now the best standard of care is to have us wait seven days after surgery before doing shoulder mobility exercises.  Other studies have shown that we most certainly do need to do those exercises, so don't ignore them--just wait the week.  Unfortunately, not all breast surgeons are up to date on these findings, and neither are all physical therapists.  So you may have to argue a bit on this one.  Here's a link to the study abstract, in case you need to pass it along:  http://www.physiotherapyjournal.com/article/S0031-9406(08)00113-2/abstract This study, along with one by Torres Lacomba, was mentioned in several presentations at the recent National Lymphedema Network research conference.  Both support the need to do stretching and mobility work after mx, especially mx coupled with node dissection, but that we need to do it smartly. I would also add that if you can, get a referral now for pre-surgery baseline arm measures, both arms--so if you have early LE symptoms, you can have an accurate way to measure if swelling is occurring compared to before surgery.  We don't want you to get LE, but if you do, we want it to be diagnosed at the earliest possible moment so you can get early treatment for the best possible outcome.  Baseline arm measures help that goal.  They should be taken by a qualified LE therapist who takes them all the time. There's quite a technique to doing them well and accurately. Others may come along with more suggestions--how very smart of you to ask about this before hand!! Best of luck for an uneventful and speedy recovery! Carol",

When actual visible bleeding appeared (again, after many years) I had diagnostic mammograms, a ductogram (dye injected into nipple/duct and then mammogram, and it was painless), and MRI, and these led to discovery of the papillomas.   These diagnostics happened to also disclose some suspicious lesions, that led to biopsy and a finding of LCIS, which is not cancer but a marker for elevated BC risk. I have a crazy family BC history so opted for prophylactic bilateral mastectomy to plummet my risk, and in so many ways, I'm grateful to the discharge for putting me on a path to discovering the LCIS, otherwise I might well have not been able to do preventative mx.  Long story short, my discharge had zero to do with my ultimate diagnosis, and I think there's a very high probability that you'll have the same happy discovery. Best wishes.  Waiting for appointments and 'the answer' is certainly agonizing, so I feel for you!",

In the article Tina links to here, the writer seems to lump implants with all types of breast surgery, not isolating added LE risk with implants.  I wish there were a good study to determine relative LE risk with the different reconstruction options.  At least this article raises the issue, although more specific information might have been given (such as the writer's sources; I recognize some of her sentences as direct lifts from the National Institutes of Health Lymphedema PDQ).

If so, the sooner you get it formally evaluated, the faster you can into treatment, and the better shot you'll have to get it under control and avoid the kind of swelling you can see in the photo series you looked at. Have you discovered step-up, speak out? It's an online group of women who met here and put together an amazing and accurate compilation of information to answer questions and suggest resources for all things LE. Here's a link to their page on finding a qualified LE therapist, who is the professional best qualified to make a diagnosis if you've got LE brewing: http://stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm There are other pages on the stepup site that you'll find helpful, including symptom descriptions. It's possible that all the heavy lifting and pushing triggered LE onset. Whether an evaluation determines you have LE or not, you might be interested in reading about exercise and the well researched guidelines for slowly building up to heavy weights and resistance. The lymphatic system responds to unaccustomed weight or resistance as a stress event and sends extra lymphatic fluid to the area. When our lymphatic system is healthy, we handle that just fine, but when the pathways are damaged (as in from our BC treatments and node removal), the added lymph can collect, i.e. make the arm swell. So the idea is to build up gradually to being strong enough to heft heavy objects, so that the body takes the weight in stride instead of responding as though there's a crisis. Here's one document about exercise: http://stepup-speakout.org/Handout%20doc%20for%20SUSO-040113.pdf You'll need a referral to get an evaluation by a certified lymphedema therapist, and your primary care doctor can provide that. If you learn (as many of us have) that your MD is not familiar with LE, here's yet another great resource from stepup-speakout--a handout you can give your MD, written by a doctor who herself has LE after breast cancer treatment: http://stepup-speakout.org/essential%20informat%20for%20healthcare%20providers.htm I learned so much from the stepup site, and I think you'll find it helpful too. Hope you get to the bottom of this soon, and I especially hope that it's not LE at all and just some odd and temporary development. But just in case--the stepup resources are really, really helpful.

Six weeks out of surgery you may be experiencing post-surgical swelling that will go away and stay away, but it's indeed also possible that you're seeing early signs of truncal LE.  Here are two very good resources to read and share with the PT: http://www.lymphedemablog.com/2011/10/05/lymphedem... http://stepup-speakout.org/breast_chest_trunckal_l... I was experiencing truncal swelling that persisted 3 months after surgery and finally shamed my PS into a referral for LE evaluation.  I was astonished at that evaluation to learn that not only were my truncal symptoms likely to be LE, but my arm was also more than 10% bigger than the arm where no nodes were removed (and my LE arm is my non-dominant arm, so normally it should be smaller not bigger than the other arm).  I had not noticed that difference at all, but it did explain some sensations of heaviness and aching that I was feeling.  One thing I learned from that experience is the importance of getting baseline arm measures, so you can know for sure how much an arm changes over time after surgery. I also learned that the eye is not a very good judge of subtle swelling. You'll learn from the links above that diagnosing truncal LE is challenging, and I encourage you to nudge that PT to take your symptoms seriously and do some arm measuring now, too.  If it all goes away as you continue to recover from surgery, that's wonderful, but just in case you're brewing LE, well, it's better that you have those baseline arm measures now and that you learn as much as you can about how to minimize your exposure to risks and events that can increase the chances that you develop LE. Hoping that it's post-surgical swelling that will resolve itself and leave you alone thereafter, but also hoping that you'll get some better support from your PT to do more than just wait and see.
