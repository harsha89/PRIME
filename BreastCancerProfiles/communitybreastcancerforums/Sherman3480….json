Of course, when I get to a drug that causes hair loss, I won't be able to conceal my situation. The thing is, unfortunately, that a lot of people feel scared and bad when they hear about your cancer diagnosis; they can't handle or even process their own emotions, let alone respond to yours. That's where the clumsy/hurtful remarks come in.",

The way I handle this--restricting talk about my disease to very, very few people--is not for everyone.  I'm not even sure it's the right thing to do because if you exclude potentially negative experiences, you're excluding potentially positive experiences as well; maybe if I was open with more people, I'd find more support.  All I know is that my expectations are pretty low and this is how I protect myself.",

If the school your daughters attend has a behaviorist, you might try running this past him/her.

Try having your older daughter ignore the behavior, if at all possible. In the beginning, this will lead to escalation (the repetitive questions intensify as younger sis tries to get expected response from older sis) but eventually, if older sis can keep up her end, it should die out. --I like the suggestions above for substituting another activity that may be attractive to both kids. --it's time to set aside more special mom/daughter time for older sis, since she's focussing a lot who gets more attention and love.

It is really difficult for a child to understand that the weird, ASD behavior is not intentional; that takes a level of emotional maturity that they just don't have at this point.",

That is how \"bankrupt\" (insert snicker) the program is. 6.  America is a rich country.  The Wall Street bailout of 2008 involved trillions of dollars.  The people who tell you Social Security is bankrupt don't want you to think about that.  They don't want you to think about how much we spent on the Iraq war, either.  When it comes to the insurance program you have spent your working life paying into, suddenly America is poor.  Why is that? 7.  The people who accuse others of being part of a \"dependency culture\" by taking Social Security handouts are the first in line with their hands out when their own self interest is involved.  Believe me, I know; I file the claims for these people.  It's always \"completely different\" when their interest is involved. 8.  Any woman with stage 4 breast cancer who goes on Social Security is getting far fewer payments than her healthy counterpart who will retire at age 65.  The correct response to this beast who muttered about \"printing money\" is:  \"I'm planning on dying soon from my cancer so don't worry, there'll be enough for you when your time comes so don't worry about it, you'll retire to Florida just fine\" 9.  It is a measure of just how low our politicians and media have sunk that a woman with metastatic cancer worries about tapping the system because there may not be enough left for her disabled daughter.  That is what they want you to believe.  That is not what objective analysis of our situation shows.  There is enough for everyone.   Yes, after 2033 something will have to be done.  It will probably be along the lines of reducing Social Security payments to those making above a certain threshold ie the wealthy.  If this worries you, don't:  the wealthy in America are doing fine and they're not moving anywhere.",
