If menopause did not have me a mess, this does. I asked my husband if this is BC, what do we do? Men seem to never think about the what if. That makes me angry at him I am a emotional mess. Everyone have a great week and Wednesday cannot come fast enough for me. Luv you my sisters in the journey:) Log in to post a reply",

Once they locate area they num you pretty good. Not much pain there. The incision is tiny very tiny. Not much bleeding. A little but not much. Tylenol will take care of any discomfort once you are home. Relax if you can really not bad. The waiting on results is the worst.",

I called the imaging center this morning to ask a fee questions in fear and the nurse said my microcalcifications are BR-4 what ever that means and that they use that so a biopsy can be performed. I asked her about previous images from last year and before and she said the calcification a were not there. I said to her that my Gyno said to me years ago I have very cystic breast and could that cause them. Well anxiously waiting and trying not to worry thanks to our sister here Bessie. I am trying. My question is if at this stage br4 is that mean early? I really do luv you guys in the spirit and paying for benign. But please know this if benign I will never leave this site.
