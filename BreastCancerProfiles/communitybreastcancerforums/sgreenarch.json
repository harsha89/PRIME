Hubby happens to be a PS and works lots w BC. At first when i was a walking zombie, in total shock, actually we were both just reeling, that verbal distinction was important. It is so so hard, but you will be strong and get through this next stage. You are not a sick person, you HAD breast cancer and now you are working on recovering and doing the best you can to live a long healthy life. Hugs to you, shari",

Had the BRCA test which was negative. Decided to have the extended gene sequencing tested because we have a curious thing going on in my family. I have 6 cousins who have had BC all related through my maternal grandmother, yet none are a first degree relatives of mine. My mother, her sister and their mother or her sister didn't have BC, yet these cousins in my generation did. The sequencing showed 3 brca2 mutations of unknown clinical significance. None of the other cousins have had the extended sequencing done and I sometimes wonder if they'd find the same mutations and perhaps we would discover a new mutation. We are of eastern European, Slavic Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Mom did have lung cancer in 2009 and survived. Dad died of leukemia in 2012. Not sure if this is relevant. Lots of smart geneticists here in israel due to the prevalence of the BRCA genes in the population and they told me not to think about this. But I do wonder. Any thoughts would be appreciated:)",

How was i supposed to make treatmt decisions? I actually went to 3 oncologists who all were adamantly against chemo for me. One even said it would be a crime to give a person in my situation chemo, but I had a very hard time thinking that maybe I wasn't doing everything I could. I was 49 at dx, premenopausal, had a unilateral mx, no rads either. I am taking Zometa 2 times a year, though it's benefit in preventing recerrance is controversial. It's not so risky, so my onc thinks I should continue with it. I think the fact that I had lobular may have played a small part in the decision as well. Don't know. Here in Israel, where unfortunately breast cancer is common, they feel that US docs may tend to over prescribe chemo. More than Israeli or European docs. I made peace with my decision and am trying to feel like I'm aiding my treatment by eating right, exercising and relaxing more. And praying! Lots of love and try not to second guess yourself once you make this decision.",

At least this made me laugh.) I was very tired that day and had fever and aches yesterday, but except for some residual fatigue I am fine today. And so happy this is behind me. I went through dental hell to get there, doing all the dental work I had neglected to do over the years, including 2 extractions. I was nervous about time passing, but there doesn't seem to be any greater priority than getting one's dental health in top shape, according to my oncologist. Took me 3 mos. I was told to drink lots of water before and after the infusion, which I did, and also to ask that the infusion be given more slowly than as prescribed. Over 1/2 hour rather than 15 minutes. This all helped and I would say that Zometa is not something to be scared of.  Grateful it's there for us.",

I had some rough SEs last time (flu like symptoms for a few days, fever) but overall ok. I try not to be too cynical re drug company motives and just trust my doctor but I can understand such feelings. I don't actually know for sure that this drug is adding anything to my treatment but it is a new application, and relatively risk free so why not try it. That's how I see it but each one of us has to make her own calculations. Best wishes, shari",

I nominate you all as my official online support group as if I were to ever join one I doubt I could find one as specific as this one. This is the difficulty that lingers for me. The problem is not my husband. It is me and my discomfort with myself, lacking a breast. He had a good line during one of our million reassuring talks, 'would you love me any less if I had burn scars on my chest.' well it's different of course, but it did make me think. Ironically my husband is a plastic surgeon who does lots of reconstructions but he recognizes that it's not for everyone. In my case I didn't want implants or huge surgery (I've overheard lots of stories of complications.) I think we both know how limited this surgery really is. It has it's place for some, just not for me. That being said, I mourn the loss of this breast and wish for self acceptance. Our sex life is fine but I have yet to have sex once without thinking of cancer. I just miss him kissing both breasts. Though I'm grateful that we still have one to play with I'm not at peace with her either as its still hard not to see a breast as a time bomb. I'm trying. Recently met some long time unimx survivors. Otto, I know my DH would love me if I had to lose the other side. I think any husband who wouldn't isn't worth keeping anyway. Thanks for listening! Shari",

I feel as if i am sitting in a circle of friends, discussing a painful issue only we can understand. I have been all over the place on this. I didnt do immediate reconstruction after my unimx as i felt i needed to deal with cancer only at first. Couldnt imagine clouding my head with aesthetic decisions when survival seemed to be at stake. Once i got through dx and settled on a treatmt plan i began to deal with life minus one breast. Being assymetrical presents its own difficulties such as the inability to go flat (i look quite strange-very obviously one- breasted.) but i bought good swimming and everyday foobs and bras and when dressed i can forget about it for a while. Without recon there are so many small difficulties you have to consider, such as avoiding children in locker rooms so as not to freak them out, wearing high enough cut clothing, making sure my foob doesnt wander, dealing with stupid medical techs, or airport security, etc. I figured i would get to recon but when i started to investigate i realized that i dont want to have implants and i am not a flap candidate. That leaves the new fat grafting method (BRAVA) which is the least invasive and most natural but it takes the longest and I want to be very sure it is safe first, as it is so new. I just had my third surgery in three yrs (oopherectomy) and i am just tired.even though i never thought i would still be unreconstructed, I am not unhappy that i am not rushing. Ironically, my DH happens to be a PS (something about shoemaker's children going shoeless...) but he loves me with em or without and is not pushing me in any direction. I miss my breast terribly and do hate that dealing with the lack of it is a daily reminder of BC. On the other hand, the other day i had a moment of clarity and decided to try to love the new me, in whatever state i might find myself. For me this is huge. Thanks for listening, sgreenarch.",

I was suffering from horrendous menstrual cramps and my parents took me to a gynecologist. He noticed that I had a \"DES daughter looking cervix.\" My parents then remembered that my mother had indeed taken something during the first 3 mos of pregnancy to prevent morning sickness. The obstetrician had died and the hospital had burnt down so there were no records. However, my father was a pharmacist and he remembered that the pill was DES. I went on to have 4 healthy pregnancies and deliveries. Three yrs ago I had a hysterectomy due to a huge fibroid and at that time they saw that my uterus was positioned strangely, too. I did always mention to whatever gyn I was seeing that I was a DES daughter. No one ever mentioned vigilance about breast cancer. Mine was found on a routine mammogram this summer by a very astute radiologist (lobular isn't easy to see.) I don't know that I would have done anything differently except perhaps lived with more anxiety, so maybe it's better that I wasn't aware of any heightened risk. But I do think that ob/gyns should remind DES daughters to have regular mammograms. Not sure about this class action suit. I have no documented proof besides my father's memory.",

I don't know enough about this, but the more I read, the luckier I realize that I am. BC has taught me to feel grateful in general, for many things. I'm down one breast but I've learned to appreciate all the wonderful things I do have. You seem to know much more than I about being a DES daughter. Do you know if there are any heightened risks for the other female cancers, such as ovarian, fallopian tubes, etc? You mention a special pap procedure. Are there any other special tests needed especially for us? Not to bother you, but do you know of a website that would outline this?  I'll tell you one thing I've enacted immediately post BC dx. I removed all extra estrogen that I have the power to remove, from my life. I try to avoid using environmental agents that can work as estrogens in the body, such as BPA plastics, certain cleaning agents, pesticides, cosmetics, etc. I also now only buy organic dairy and meat products that are hormone free. I've got a theory that some of us with ER+ BC who've also had estrogen driven fibroids and gallstones just might be hyper-reactive (or something) to estrogen.  I'd love to know if this is more true of DES daughters, just out of my own curiousity. I agree with you about the lawsuit, but I would like docs to be more aware.",
