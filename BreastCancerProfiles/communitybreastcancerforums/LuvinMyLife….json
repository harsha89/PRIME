Hang in there, it's going to be alright. Second - yesterday and today have been much better with the pain. THANK GOD. Constipation is gone. THank you high dose Vit C. Third- Got my drain out today WHOO HOOO! YES YES YES! Also got my path report: Triple negative 5 of 8 nodes positive so that bumps me to Stage 3 instead of Stage 2b - (could use some encouragement here) I talk to an onacologist in the next week to discuss treatment, which for me may not include chemo because of co-morbid conditions that are contraindicative. I will for sure be doing radiation. Since there aren't any other systemic treatments for triple negatives besides chemo, if I can not take chemo I suppose I'll have to look for other things that help systemically. Anyway that's the update. I did get some good news, I thought I'd have more nodes than just 5- and I also thought he took more than 8 so......  I know staging is just that, staging. So I need to keep positive after hearing that. Best of luck and hugs to everyone just out of surgery or getting ready for surgery. The first week passes really quick. Keep on top of your pain meds and before you know it the annoying drain(s) will be gone. ",

I can say that there are days that my arm is KILLING ME. The nerves have all woke up and they are pissed at me. lol  I try to kill the pain with alternating heat and cold and now I can take Advil which doesn't make me sick like the tylox.  I had a small sarcoma drained last Wednesday. Not much just 1 oz of fluid but that was enough fluid to press on nerves. My arm really does ache and the skin is raw to the touch. I mean it feels raw. Like glass being rubbed into it. It aches all the way to my fingers. I suppose some of this is normal post op - nerve stuff.  I do have some swelling where the fluid was ( right by my armpit ) may have a teeny tiny bit of fluid in there again. I meet with the ONC on Monday. I just wonder how long the nerve/post op pain lasts until there is some relief. PS  glad to hear so many more have made it through their surgeries. I hope everyone is finding it a little more easy every day. ",

Thanks for letting me know that you all have been dealing with exhaustion too. Today is my birthday and it's 4 days past surgery. last night around midnight I had some extreme pain in my arm - it was throbbing, and I also had some pain above my surgery area. below my clavical. boring(sp) pain - like I was being dug into.  Hurt pretty bad, let me know I could feel lol.  Then the nerve stuff started. I know this might freak others out, but it freaked me out. It felt as if I huge worm was moving in my shoulder area. I DO NOT like this sensation. I'd rather take the zaps than this one. lol  so my arm has ached quite a bit today. I guess this is just normal territory after surgery? What I mean by that is, the medication takes the peak off but this is the first time I've just had a constant aching/throbbing since surgery. It's lasted over 16 hours now. Thank goodness the pain meds help some. Would love to hear from others on the pain and how long of span they experienced pain before it calmed down and went back to intermittent(sp) Thanks all, and here's to good news and relief to all the post op appts coming up!

( health issues )  there are no studies that show or prove chemo kills micro cells that may be floating around in your body. Even if you do chemo before surgery and they get the right chemo that shrinks your tumor it doesn't necessarily mean it is killing any micro cells that could be in your body. Chemo before or after surgery has the same survival percentages. Having chemo before or after doesn't change the stats. All it does is shrink the tumor, and possibly nodes(if they are involved) (once they find the right chemo) and that gives them better surgical margins, and can save more breast tissue.  Having chemotherapy only increases survival rates 2- 4%  - surgery, radiation, and other systemic treatments (herceptin, and hormone treatment) are the things that increase survival rates. Try researching online medical journal statistics on these things, do not google just random pages because you won't find correct information. I was upset that I might not be able to take chemo and through research I found out a lot of information that most do not know. When you are faced with cancer and you're vunerable you do whatever you can to save your life, but I'm not sure I want to poison my body knowing it only gives me such a small percentage of uping my survival. It is a VERY personal decision. Not one to take lightly.",

I came home after 24 hours and the only thing I don't like is the JP drain. I had to make sure my bandages were ok like the doc said to and found that where my drain enters my body below my breast had started to bleed. Called in on a weekend and the nurse said to just clean it and apply new gauze. It happens sometimes and you don't even know. So I had to rebandange it but it's just fine. I wanted to mention that in case anyone has that issue. I am just rambling - probably the tylox - 6 days until I can see doc and take this thing out. Hope everyone else is doing great. To those that haven't had surgery yet - don't worry about it, and don't worry about it being painful after, if you keep on top of your meds you're gonna be fine. I let mine lapse in the hospital 2 hours and it was a nightmare, so utilize the meds. MUCH HUGS!!",

Of course I'm wearing this super sexy binder and if you pull it out you can see the bandage across your chest. My question is this, is it hard up front? Meaning - I placed my hand on the upper part of my chest right by my armpit and it's hard. Almost like when you get a bruise and there is knot in it. Just wondering if it goes away. I know things aren't real soft and pretty right after surgery but I just want to know if anyone else has had this. Weird and foreign. I'm going to take my pain med now, that will help me not think of it.",

My arm ached like no tomorrow. I mean I haven't experienced pain like I've had today. My sister tells me it's just post op pain things are angry and irritated. I had this pain before surgery but it's worse now. Aching, throbbing, numbness etc. Skin hurts to the touch. I did take my pain meds and it brought the pain from a 10 to a 2.5 - I just feel like I'm the only one having so much pain. I thought I read where others had some pretty intense pain after surgery (from node dissection) but not in this posing thread. Anyhoo best of luck to each of us - my post op is Friday.",
