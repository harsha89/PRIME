Some infection around the nails of my big toes and an \"ouch\" feeling when I walk for about 4 days at end of cycle and just into the off cycle days (3,500mg per day on 14 days on, 7 days off cycle.) Is 100mg an effective dose of Vitamin B6? How much do others take? With love from Australia Joy K",

BUT then AIDS became a very treatable disease and was looked on as a survivable chronic disease (just like Stage 4 breast cancer is becoming) and they were faced with living not dying and having to face major financial decisions. What will be the effect of bankruptcy on my future? etc. The struggle to pay off debts on welfare made life very difficult for many just when they should have been celebrating their survival!!

Have had chemotherapy, right breast mastectomy, radiation then more radiation for skin mets that happened when I was on Arimidex. Have been classed as hormone refactory and am currently on Xeloda and Bondronat (a biphosphonate like Zometa.) Last blood test showed CA15-3 has dropped to normal levels, so something is working at the moment. Love these discussion boards, all participants are knowledgeable about current USA treatments and we tend to get them here just after they have been approved by your FDA. Don't understand your Insurance system, all cancer treatments are free over here, although you can go through the private system if you have paid your own Health Insurance - more luxurious rooms in hospital etc. With love from Australia Joy K",
