I noticed a sudden sharp burning pain to the right inner lower quadrant of my breast, around 6 - 7 o'clock position. 1-2 inches below my nipple. By adjusting the bra I meant doing the scoop and swoop motion bring excess tissue into the cup. I didn't think much about it at first. Thought I might have pulled a muscle or something. Tho it didn't feel like muscle pain. and I didn't do strenuous exercise recently. But I didn't think much. But later that night, when I sleep on the side I noticed the same pain when I turn to the right side. It wasn't the pressure triggering the pain but it's the turning causing the pull on the skin. I would have the brief burning pain. Its been 4-5 days now. I got scared and been very careful with moving my breast to avoid triggering the pain. But I just did a quick test, and the pain is still there with pulling motion. I read online about the cyclic and non cyclic pain. But it says burning pain can happen but didn't specify if those pain are spontaneous or its triggered by position like mine. My period ended a week ago. It also say those pain are usually to the outer upper quadrant not inner lower like mine. I don't want to freak out and over worry but then I read about posts from people dx with breast ca with pain in the inner quadrant. ..any advice on what to do? I'm 29 y/o. Thank you for taking the time to read and advices in advance! Log in to post a reply",
