Because it is expensive, my mom wants to use it carefully, she wants to ask if she can start Herceptin on it's own first or better wait to start with her next chemo?  And her onc suggests her to use Germzar/Xeloda with Herceptin on her next circle. My mom is a bit worried about Xeloda, it causes her stomache sometimes. She is thinking if she can just use Germzar/Herceptin. I know my mom very well, she is over-protected herself sometimes, i will consider what she worries about, but i'd like to get some suggestions from you then decide. Thx everyone.

      "Content": "shengyue527 wrote: Hi, it's Yue here, since my mom started her chemo, I found some chinese medical tips can help her with the side effects of chemos, i list them here, hopeful they can help you or your family. a)Tongue During/after the chemo, most ppl got problems with their tongues(thick,white), that's because the chemo produces heat in your liver. Loach(fish) is best for reducing the heat in liver. My mom told me she can get loach in fishing shops in China because normally ppl use it as bait when they go fishing. Cooking method: get fresh loach meat and mince it, mix a bit salt and/or pepper. shape the mince like little meatballs and eat it raw, it's just like sushi, taste ok nothing horrible at all.  One loach each day. my mom only need two days to cure her tongue. b)Cold body or cold hand and feet, also good for tiredness Chemos treatments can exhaust your body energy. After reduce the heat of your liver, you can start to warm your body. red dates and fresh ginger are the best and the easiest you can get them anywhere in the world( you can buy dried dates from any chinese supermarkets) Cut some ginger into slices and boil with dates, about 20 mins. Drink it everyday, if you like it tastes sweet, put some unrefined cane sugar, you will get your energy back much quicker. Moxa is the best plant for blood circulation. I saw some ppl are suffering from cold feet. So if you can find Moxa in your country, put some moxa leaves in while you soaking your feet. c) Good foods and bad foods for chemo ppl After chemos, your body is really weak. As a chinese we believe everything u eat can affect your condition, as western ppl prefer nutrition we have our own way to divide them. The nature of the food is cold or warm. chemo ppl should eat the warm food and avoid the cold food. Warm food fruits: peach, apricot, dates, lemon, coconut juice vegs:  onion, spring onion, coriander, garlic, pumpkin, ginger Meats: chicken, lamb and pork fishes: eel(yellow eel is the best one) Milk and egg are warm as well Cold food Fruits: sharon fruit, grape fruit, banana, watermelon, kiwi fruit vegs:  bitter melon meats: duck, hare, frog, snail, duck eggs Most seafoods are cold so if you really want some seafood, you can mix them with onion/spring onion and ginger.  Some other common foods such as apple, pear,pineapple, grapes, tunips, yam... most of them are in the middle, not too cold, not too warm, so you can eat them, just try to eat more warm food. :) And better not eat vegs in raw like salad, make it hot, steam, roast or whatever. d)Nausea In China, we can get some chinese herbal medicine after chemo to reduce the anorexia, nausea and vomitting, but i know it might be difficult to u understand it. but there is a easy way i can explain to you. Ginger, tangerine skin and honey fresh ginger(DONOT peel the skin) 20g, fresh tangerine skin 250g, honey 100g cut ginger into small pieces, add some warm water then pound it, get the ginger juice, put honey in, stir it. Then cut the tangerine skin into small slices, put them into ginger and honey juice, preserve for about one week, then it's ready for chemo nausea. When you feel nausea, try some preserved tangerine skin slices, if you like it, eat 3 times a day, each time about 20g is ok. :)  Dx 9/21/2006, IDC, 6cm+, Stage IV, Grade 3, 6/12 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

Before her onc was trying to give radiation on her chest to control them but he cannot find a right position to avoid damaging her lungs, so finally failed and just using chemos. Now my mom is so worried and believes these little lumps is killing her one day. Because i am an oversea student in uk and my visa is end of this month so i posted my passport to home office for visa extention, it takes at least 2-3weeks to come back. My mom told me today she was getting annoyed with it, she wanted me to go back asap before she dies. I am so upset even i know she is on her chemos and getting depressed very often. Please help! Anyone experienced these little lumps? any idea how to treat them?? Yue Dx 9/21/2006, IDC, 6cm+, Stage IV, Grade 3, 6/12 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",
