My case a little similar: DCIS diagnosed via mammogram and core biopsy,had surgery at Memorial Sloan in NYC and most margins were clear but  1 margin contained 3mm IDC ( Invasive Ductal Carcinoma Grade III) so I was floored when the pathology arrived and the surgeon told me.I have copy of pathology...I was angry and shocked when I heard it, later I was thankful she found it.. had MRI of breast and mammogram last week as my second surgery is on 6/15 to attempt clear margins and test the sentinel node- and if positive at the surgery they will take more or all my nodes out..very scary My pathology report indicates no vascular invasion. The MRI and mammogr is ok thank GOD and the surgeon thinks if I want to save the breast 2nd surgery is the next step as the sentinel biopsy is either way a must whether i elect lumpectomy or mastectomy. Once there is an invasive component found in the breast tissue lymph nodes must be tested...and Memorial Sloan is a cancer center..people travel days to get  to this place and be treated there..they very kind and nice, everyone cares...but I tend to focus on the pathology rather then promises...as my initial DCIS turned into IDC ...so I tend to believe in what I will be able to read on my path report. My little education since the day of my DCIS diagnosis on May 1st tells me that if I would be in your shoes I wouldnt worry I would rather look for an appointment 2nd opinion at a cancer center if you can afford it or if your insurance is accepted at their facility. I do agree with the person who wrote in that the CT is for lungs 99% of the time and they are looking for infection,abnormal growth...that is it and you should know infection lights up as well...so try not to worry at least when it is no evidence of alarm sounding..i know easier said then done.. i decided to try to keep my days and hours as normal as possible until my surgery..( hard but i will try) why? because i have to try to learn to live with a lot of uncertain things and i dont want my blood pressure affected...( i have 127/78 AND THAT IS GOOD FOR AGE 65 ) like to keep it the same and also it affects my sleep if i continue to worry 24/7...needless to say cancer is on my mind always.. Wish you and everyone well..and sending my positive thoughts your way... Good night and good luck everyone! Lizzy",

I was told I will be getting rads 5 weeks and the 6th week boosts in prone position with my breast hanging under/over an opening of the table and they will do whole breast radiation. I am not 100% decided and will have 2nd opinion on monday morning.( i couldnt get in to see this specific doctor earlier) I am treated at Memorial Sloane in NYC and I am 65 years old and otherwise healthy person working out 5 days a week. I was seriously thinking to avoid radiation especially after the oncotype test that revealed 9% recurrence in 10 years..but then again this devil might haunt me 1-2 years later again...it is such a gamble either way.. Like to know from others about side effects years later...rads side effects??  thanks to all who give their time and their heart and soul to educate others and truly help lots of us over some rough time...we all need a shoulder occasionally...even if we strong and go all the way. best health to all lizzy",
