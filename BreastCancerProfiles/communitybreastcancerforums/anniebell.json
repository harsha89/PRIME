Well I took the bull by the horns and had my head shaved tonight!!  It was actually quite liberating if you want to know the truth and my wig feels better and looks better with no hair under it.  The woman I went to tweeked the wig a bit and gave me some adhesive strips which helps it lay closer to the scalp and look more realistic.  I was tired of the waiting and wondering. I do realize however, that I would not make a very attractive bald person as my ears stick way out(I have hated this since I was a kid) and I resemble Shrek LOL!!  I did put ice pack on my hands/nails during my first treatment along with sucking on ice chips.  I don't know if the chemo will affect my nails but really...on more thing to make me feel unattractive...I thought I would try it for the heck of it.    The swallowing thing hasn't gotten any worse.  I think like you said Heather,  just part of the whole mouth issue.  My mouth isn't sore but maybe it's dryer than I realized.   Hope everyone continues feeling better.  Again Lisa, I will keep you in my prayers.   ",

Does anyone ever feel like this dreadful stuff is lurking everywhere in your body and that every ache, pain or discomfort is something ominous?  I can't seen to shake it.  I spoke with my MO on Wednesday about it and he suggested that I meet with the Oncology Psychiatrist to discuss my feelings and anxieties which I think will be a good thing.  I can't get into see her until my last chemo visit but I thought that having the support start when I am not being monitored as regularly as when going through the chemo might be a good thing.  I believe in utilizing the resources available and hope this will help lessen the feelings that I have. Starting day 2 post round 2 after my Nuelasta shot yesterday afternoon. I took the Claritin and am hoping for less pain and discomfort than after round 1.  I think I am getting some neuropathy in my right foot though.  I only iced my fingers and mouth with the first 2 so  who knows.  Overall still doing Ok.  Worked all day yesterday but taking today off since this was the day after round 1 that the aching set in and I work 30 miles from home. Didn't want to drive that far if I start feeling lousy plus...last minute holiday things to do as well!!  If I haven't said it recently, I just want to remind all of you how grateful I am to have your support through all of this.  Happy Holidays to all and thank you for being such an important part of this journey. ",

The Claritian did help with the aching as I mentioned before. Does anyone emotionally crash after the steroids wear off?    Regarding the side effects...I have been wearing my wig for about 3 weeks but this time my scalp was on fire and I have a rash on the top of my head with little pimples.  It's better today but Saturday was awful. The stubble that I do have left on my head is coming out more so I suspect that the pain was a precursor to it falling out. I too had/have gel nails on before chemo.  The kind that I have don't soak off and I didn't want them to file them off my nails for fear that they would be more weak and brittle so I am just growing them out.  I  have them french manicure style so the nail bed is visible and I did have a schelacque polish put over them.  The chemo team seems to be ok with this.  I haven't had kidney pain but I do get a burning under my right ribs at times.  Wonder if it's gallbladder issues? My appetite was outrageous yesterday!!  I ate everthing that wasn't nailed down.  Salty foods seemed to be the best and sweets. Everything that I know I shouldn't eat but it made me feel better.  Hoping that those who start this week have uneventful treatments and know that the waiting is the worst part.  For those who are post 1 or 2 we are just that much closer to getting off this train. ",

Eyebrows and lashes are sparse but still holding on.   How I found my lump was a bit of devine intervention.  I ran into something with my boob while I was camping with a bunch of girlfriends and at the time grabbed my self and said \"that's going to leave a mark\" but went on with the fun of the weekend.  About a week later I rolled over in bed and it hurt there so I started poking around and it was lumpy and tender.  I had forgotten that I had run into something until my PCP asked if I had any trauma when I went to see her the next day.  She wasn't all that concerned but said we should check it out just to be safe.  I actually had my mammo the following day at the small rural hospital that I work at.  The tech is also a BC survivor and told me that something didin't look right.  The radiologist spent quite a bit of time going over my US and mammo with me at that time...I'm sure because I was an emplyoyee.  I was pretty prepared to hear the news after my biopsy results were in.  If I hadn't ran into something, I wonder how long it would have been before I would have found it.  I had had a clean mammo 9 months prior but it's ILC and it doesn't show up well on regular mammos.   Bailey...I loved your book story and will be looking for it. I too have had weight gain.  Not sure if it is fluid retention but I doubt it because I continue to have a voracious appetitie.  My taste buds get a little dicey but it doesn't seem to affect what I eat(anything not nailed down!!) I too am emotional and still get anxious about it \"being everywhere\" I'm hoping my visits with the Onc Psych will help me work through it better than I'm doing on my own.  Maybe she will suggest some meds. I hope everyone has a good week.  Does anyone have a treatment?  I feel like this is an in between week for all of us.    Oh and Heatherweather and anyone else interested,  Headcovers.com has human hair eyebrows that are on a clear silicone base and glue on.  They come in a variety of shapes.  I have them but haven't used them yet.  They look like they would be nice if the eyebrows decide to vacate completely. ",

CKK-headcovers,com has human hair eyebrows that are attached to a clear gel and are adhered with glue to your skin if drawing them on isn't your forte.  I got a pair early on.  Haven't used them yet but who knows.  I can not get the hang of false eyelashes...I am noticing hair growing on my head.  The soft, fine stuff, with more grey then I remember, but I did read somewhere that the hair pigments get destroyed with the hair follicles from chemo and it doesn't always stay grey So yes, the fatigue this weekend was overwhelming.  I can't remember ever spending virtually 36+ hours in bed before. I couldn't believe how awful I felt.  I was so envious Lisa that you went out to eat and a walk.  I woke up this morning wondering how I was going to make it at work today but I had an appointment with the accupuncturist at lunch, got my \"Chi\" back in line, and now I feel like a million bucks...relatively speaking!   Rachel...did those keys ever turn up?  I felt so bad that a lovely afternoon ended that way..

This is an excellent group of women here and as you have read, if there is a side effect to be had, at least one of us has had it. It's been a great support to me to have these ladies by my side going through this maze. Rachel , I think that if you like being a red head then that's the new you!! A silver lining in that it let you change something about yourself that you may not have had the courage to do before.  Joyce...give your son a big hug for me would you please.  Good idea to check the scalp while we can see it. Karmil,  Do what makes you feel the best as far as the wig goes.  People change their hairstyle and color all of the time.   So I have to say that I'm feeling better day 1 post TE exchange than I did after my  BMX.  Just achey but haven't had any pain pills since yesterday afternoon.  They definitely feel softer and less like bricks.  Still swollen and a bit smaller than I wanted but really who cares.  I'm just glad that this part is over too.   Apparently they 'drop\" as the healing occurs so it's hard to tell how they are going to look. Off to take another siesta.  It's beautiful here today.  I may take a walk later. ",

I had a bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction 5 weeks ago,which really has been a walk in the park. I feel like once all of the symptoms and side effects kick in, the reality of this beast will be overwhelming.  I thought I might get away without chemo but my onc. is pushing it.  Said the ONC-DX reports showing the benefits from chemo are based on on older chemo meds and that the newer ones are more beneficial.  So all aboard!! Having others share their experience is sooo helpful as we try to navigate through this dense fog. I'ts reassuring to know we are not alone.  Keep us posted...we can share war stories.  Good luck to you.",

I did have an estrodial test run to confirm my menopause.  I know that before I had my BMX I felt like my whole body was ridden with cancer.  Even now sometimes I feel like it's everywhere but in my head I know it's not.  Funny you brought up the anti-depressants and anxiety meds because I was just thinking about that today.  I'm going to wait and see how i'm doing after this first round and after my hair falls out which may kick all the emotions up a notch.   Robin--glad to hear from you and thank you for your thoughts and prayers. I was getting a little worried.  So the health care provider in me wants to know on a scale of 1 -10 how the bone pain with the Neulasta was.  I'm more nervous about that I think than the chemo itself. ",

I have seen a lot of ports in my day but never a chemo one so I'm not sure how prominent they are.  I basically feel like I have hit by a mack truck.  Not awful but not good either.  Very tired yesterday.  I almost feel guilty...like I should be doing something productive but don't feel like it.  Some mild body aches from the Neulasta. Had to call poison control yesterday morning because I accidentally took 2 Zofran instead of 1.  No reaction but on a positive note,,,no nausea either.   You know it sounds to me like we are all active, independent women and this sense of feeling so unlike ourselves is difficult.  I do feel that even though you read how women keep active and exercise and work, etc. through all of this, it's important for each of us to listen to our own bodies and not try to be superwomen or keep up with the Jones's.  None of us know how we are going to react from moment to moment. This is a time to take good care of ourselves so that in the big picture we come out stronger.  I will be thinking of all of you today.",

I'm back from #3 and I am definitly more tired today, like you were Robin, but I had very little sleep last night no doubt from the steroids.  I could crash right now but going to try and hold off to get some real sleep tonight I hope.   My Onc was impressed with the results from the Claritin.  I can't believe he hadn't heard about it before since I know that some of yours have.  He is very evidenced based in his practice so since there is no clinical studies on it, I'm sure it's why he didn't know.  He did say that he would pass the info on to others, however.  It felt kind of good to be teaching him something new. Hope those with infusions Thursday have smooth and uneventful times and keeping you all in my daily prayers.   ",

The MACK or is it MAC?? truck situation has passed for me but I think it's because I went to bed last night at 7 and fell right to sleep.  Wave, winter has hit large and in charge here and I would agree with you that the dreariness and darkness do not help the cause at all. Lou where is this beach you are talking about? I could use a beach, ocean and a pina colada right about now!!! As of tonight I am going to say that I am 95% of my usual self but no doubt I will end up jinxing myself and feel lousy again tomorrow. Hey does anyone notice that their hair is growing? (for the ones who shaved).  I could swear that I have new hair growth but it's so patchy that it's hard to say.  Good night to all and hoping that everyones's SE take a turn for the better in the days to come.   ",

I definitely need to build my strength back up in that department.   The issue de jour is puffy undereyes.  I have a big puffy patch just above each cheekbone. The PS I saw yesterday said it's fluid retention.  I'm wondering if it's a sinus infection.  I look horrendous. My socks are leaving indentations around my ankles so maybe it is fluid.  I'm going to ask my MO tomorrow if I can get a water pill, or an eye job will be my next surgery. Hope that everyone else is doing OK.  What a strong group of women we are!! I am grateful to have you in my life. ",

My treatment center is about 30 miles from home but after today they have arranged to have my shot and blood draws given at an affiliated clinic 1 mile from my house. Check to see if that's an option should you need it.  I'm doing it at the infusion clinic today because I also have an appointment to have my tissue expander's filled at the same place...2 birds-1 stone. Also, I don't have a port.  When I asked about it, my Onc. said that for 4 treatments we would  see how I do and add one if necessary.  I also Heather feel your pain about drinking water.  I have to force myself but I do feel that it has helped with the non- existent nausea (and the meds too of course) but so far I haven't even had a inclining of it...knock on wood!  I was warned of constipation as a SE and water will help that too.  I have added Activia Greek yogurt to my regime for it's colon benefits and protein.  I was told that chemo patients need about 75 grams of protein a day so I'm trying to add it where ever I can.

I wear a wig everyday.  I found one very close to my own hairstyle, had my own hair cut to match the wig more closely a couple of weeks prior to the wearing the wig, then just started wearing the wig one day because my hair started getting nasty before it started falling out.  The wig was much more comfortable after I shaved my head.   I hope everything goes smoothly for you tomorrow. Keep us posted on how it went. ",

I take one does the day of the shot and 4 days after for the bone and joint pain.  I was thinking of asking my MO about not getting it for my last infusion but then I thought if it's not broke, don't fix it.   I'm curious about the weight gain issue.  Those of you who have gained...do you take the 3 day steroid routine before each infusion?  \"I have gained 5 pounds and get the steroids but can see my ankle bones.  I have been eating like a horse so I feel mine is from food rather than fluid retention.  Just wondering if the steroids( or lack of getting them) is a factor. For those moving on to the rads after this, I have heard that your skin can take a beating in the area getting treatment.  I want so share a skin care tip that I stumbled on.  There is a product call Egyptian Magic that is suppose to be good for a multitude of skin issues including aging, burns, eczema, psoriasis, etc.  I bought some yesterday at Whole Foods.  I slathered it all over me including my face, scalp(still having breakout issues there) and some lovely dry patches on various other areas of my body thanks to nasty bitter cold Wisconsin winters.  This morning I can tell my skin is better.  You can google it and get more info on it. It has beeswax in it, however, and may not work for anyone with bee sting allergies. I feel like I am rambling here.  If I left anyone out...it's not intentional and I hope your are doing well. I'm going to try to go back to sleep although it's doubtful.   I hope that today is kind to all of you.",

My hormonal system has been a mess since going thorough puberty.  Joyce,  my understanding about the Oncotype score is that it is based on Tam. because I don't think that AI's were available when the efficacy of the test was established but I could be wrong about that. I had a discussion with my MO about some new thoughts out there of starting with Tam. then switching to AI's or vice versa.  As I have mentioned, he is so evidenced based that as of now, he isn't going that route.  I will continue to do my own research on this for the future. You are right that with AI's there is bone density loss to contend with.   I was in the hospital 2 days post BMX.  Glad it wasn't longer. I'm shooting for mid March for the TE exchange providing that I have bounced back enough from the chemo.  I hope that everyone has a decent day today.  As always you are all in my  thoughts and prayers. ",

I don't know if any of you know this already but I found out from a friend who had BC that the YMCA offers a LIVESTRONG exercise class for people recovering from cancer.  It's a free 12 week course and includes a 3 month membership.

I haven't read anything about ILC vs IDC having different treatment approaches nor has my MO made mention of a difference.  I sure am considering emailing him before my TE exchange in 2 weeks to re-confirm no rads. My tumor was along my chest wall and while they got clean margins, they were small margins. The surgeon said that the tumor rolled right off the fascia so she wan't concerned about it rooting down.   Just want to clarify in the hair department that while I do have new growth, I certainly don't have a full head of new growth.  I don't want to disillusion anyone...at this point, however, any hair growth is encouraging!",

Thanks everyone again for the well wishes for my mother.  Her pacemaker is doing it's job keeping her pulse at a healthy range(it was as low a 30 when she went to ER) and her blood pressure normal. I don't have to reschedule my TE exchange although now I am wondering if my starting Arimidex will increase my risk for blood clots.  Sounds like I will be making a call tomorrow just to be safe. Rachel, I'm sorry to hear that today is rough for you.  It sounds like you had a nice time at the concert the other night.  I agree with you about appreciating things differently now. I will be glad to get these TE's out on Tuesday.  I'ts like having bricks on your chest.  I find myself holding back on hugs because they are so hard and un-natural feeling on top of being downright uncomfortable. Robin-WOOT WOOT on the weight loss.  You reminded me to drink more lemon water...thank you for that. I can't give up sugar completely but I have changed my overall eating habits considerably.  I use to cook(on the occasions when I actually did) with the Paula Dean stick of butter protocol.  That recipe is now gone along with fried foods and various other unhealthy meals but I still like chocolate.  I don't like dark chocolate but making myself eat that instead of milk chocolate when I do.  I have lost about 4-5 lbs. of the 10 that I gained during chemo. Karmil,  I hope that sore throat doesn't turn into anything more than that.  I'm ready to ditch the wig too.  I also have the wig hugger band which does make wearing it more comfortable but I was noticing the same thing as you as far as hair not growing in the area.  I don't want to do anything to discourage hair growth at this stage of the game. I'm glad to hear that your daughter hasn't been too heartbroken about the fish.   Ckk...how are you doing?  I still get short of breath with climbing stairs and distance walking almost 6 weeks out from my last chemo but I am slowing getting stronger.  It will come. I will be thinking of you tomorrow and that the BMRI goes well. Wave,  I hope you enjoyed your pedicure.  That was the first thing I did when I knew I was out of the danger zone for infections.  It felt so good.  My feet looked like my mothers after all of this.  Pedicures are a sign of summer!! I admire you for participating in the rads clinical trial.  Kathy,  I'm sorry to hear that you had such a rough week.  You have to do what's right for you.  I don't think you fear is out of line here.  I don't think that I knew you were a teacher.  What grade? Bailey...hearing that your flowers are blooming is so encouraging!! I'm ready for this winter to be done and over(actually I'm ready for BC to be done and over).  It was in the 60's here today and it felt glorious!!  Every fall I say that I'm going to plant tulips and daffodills and then I never do. Sounds like JD is holding his own!! Gracie...did you enjoy your manicure?  It must have been good to hear your doc say that there is a low chance for recurrance on the skin.  Way to go ont he walking.  I intended on doing that today but got a manicure instead!  So far I have not had any hot flashes with the Arimidex in fact I feel cold most of the time.  I am almost 2 weeks into it.  I keep waiting for some sort of SE to hit.  The only thing I notice is my face is breaking out a bit but it may be related to peach fuzz growing back. The puffy eyes have subsided for the most part.  I have been taking antihistamines day and night so it must have been allergy related.  With the crazy winter we had who knows.  Hair update:  I have a dark hue now with a few hairs about and inch long and the remainder soft stubble. It's looking pretty dark with white patches at my temples. Here's to a good week for all ",

I'm at day 10 and I have to say that i am feeling 100 percent.  I'm not saying that to rub noses more for the other gals to see how different we all are in how we react. If it wasn't for that back issue on Tuesday I would have been 100 percent then.  Thought I was getting a cold this morning but ok tonight. Well I still have hair.  No tingling or weird sensations on my head.  My hair however has changed in texture and has gone from bad to worse so I am grateful to have my wig. Lisa I hope you have success with the caps.  My mouth has simmered down and I have to tell you that I too have gained a few pounds because I'm hungry all the time.  I had lost 15 prior to all starting chemo mostly due to stress(I had been trying to loose those 15 pounds for 3 years) but I can see that I will have to keep tabs on this. ",

My apologies in advance for any further screw ups! Sounds like a few of you guys are having a rough time of things so I am sending huge hugs and prayers that everything simmers down soon.  My mouth feels like a sandpit but it doesn't appear to affect my appetite as I have a voracious one.  I actually crave sauerkraut which is just crazy even though I am from the state of bratwurst and kraut (and beer and cheese LOL!!)  The emotional rollercoster has settled down a bit and I'm feeling better but I get waves of fatigue throughout the day.  I have been working full days but my boss lets me pace myself workload wise for which I am grateful.   I found a study at the NCI center here in Madison that is testing the TC/ Nuelasta combo.  They are giving the TC every 2 weeks versus 3 along with the shot with the rationale that the body rebounds faster with the Neulasta and can tolerate a faster pace.  I don't get my care there due to insurance but I can hardly imagine every 2 weeks of chemo.  At least this way there is a small window of feeling somewhat normal before starting the vicious cycle all over again. On the flip side your are done in 8 weeks instead of 12.   If I had to guess what the culprit is of the spasms it's the Neulasta based on my experience but this time all of the aches and pains have been minimal with the Claritin on board.  To those who are looking for wigs...good luck to you in finding a good match.  That was such a huge source of anxiety for me until I found the one i'm using.  The other day a woman at work who is also a BC survivor asked when I expected to loose my hair.  I gave a big hug and told her she just made my next 6 months!!  So we will get through all of this as those strong warriors before us have and offer hope and support to our followers.  ",

I so look forward to this becoming a part our past.   Hope everyone gets some decent sleep tonight.  Hugs to all. ",

I am liking the fact that I meet with the Psych Onc(who I adore) for just that reason.    Treatment #4 kicked really my butt initially, but now that I'm almost 3 weeks out, I feel almost normal.  Today I feel like I WANT to do something instead of feeling like I SHOULD do something. With my MO's blessings, I started taking a superfood supplement with lots of anti-oxidants along with my Vit. D and I feel like it has made a huge difference in my energy level and mood(as I was Vit. D deficient). If anyone hears something different about supplements at this point please let me know. My hair is growing back in a male balding sort of pattern LOL!!  Last weekend when i tried to dance and could barely make it, it was because my thighs felt on fire and I thought they would give out on me. I can tell my legs are getting stronger because my walking pace is picking up. My MO doesn't do routine scans which I'm not sure I agree with but he has always said that they can lead to false positives more often than not. We will see how that works. Rachel and Gracie...I hope that your SE's are simmering down a bit! Have a good Sunday everyone! ",

Kathy what a nice card you got...good to hear you are feeling better.  I have had 10# weight gain through all of this but my appetite has been out of control and I have some water retention.  I'm hoping it comes off  by kicking my activity level up a notch. My fatigue is pretty much gone and I feel like myself again...sans hair.  It hadn't completely fallen out but I did shave it. It's more like soft fuzz now.  Eyebrows and lashes still there but sparse for sure.  Getting my self psyched up for the TE exchange on March 13th.  Glad that's a Tuesday and not a Friday!",

There isn't a female MO at my medical center or for sure I would have picked one.  Good luck with the new edition.  What a pleasant distraction from BC!! Did you pick out a name yet?  Wave,  how's the arm today?  The thought of contaminated chemo is enough to put me right over the edge which I don't really have that far to go!.  I am avoiding mirrors at all costs these days.  I look like 10 miles of bad road,  Eyes still puffy, skin as dry as a lizard and pastey pale. Glad you had a nice time at the circus.   Rachel...it's a wonder you are feeling so wiped out.  you have been on the go constantly since we started this.  It's time to concentrate on you for these next 2 treatments.  Please be kind to yourself. I know keeping our usual routine gives us a sense of normalcy but you have to listen to your body too.  End of motherly lecture! Lisa, my muscles continue to ache and burn too.  I notice it mostly in my thighs.  I try stretching them thinking they will loosen up and it feels like I've got them in a vice grip. I've tried some yoga at home but haven't done it too regularly. CKK...Yahoo to new lashes and brows!!  Glad to hear that your arm is doing better. I don't know if I had generic T or not.  At this point, I don't think I want to know. Robin sound like your time spent with D was special.  My hats off to you for being up at 10 to go get her.  I'm usually in be by 9 these days.   Karmil,  I hope the hot flashes aren't too terribly bad.  My MO confirmed that Arimidex can cause them.  I knew that they would catch up with me. Heather,  good luck tomorrow starting your rads.  It's another step closer to being done. Day 4 of Arimidex and so far...not noticing anything unusual.  I am keeping my fingers crossed but I'm sure that the SE's wouldn't start this soon.   Hope everyone has a great rest of the weekend.  We got 7 inches of snow on Friday and it's going to be in the high 50's on Tuesday.  What a crazy winter!",

This afternoon the back is much better I am happy to say.  To mercy4all.  Your MO sounds like mine.  Constipation was awful.  I was certain that I was de-boarding this train and not doing it again.  My Oncotype DX score came back at 16(low risk), I had a BMX with clean but small margins no lymph node involvement and no LVI.  My Onc was very in favor of the chemo inspite of this stating that the Adjuvant Online assessment indicated benefits from it and the Oncotype DX was based on older chemo regimes.  This is how I came to terms with doing the chemo.  If the cancer does come back, do I want to saySH--! I should of done the chemo which at that point it's too late or do I want to go SH--!! well at least I did what I could to try to stop it. Ultimately, my doc said I have to do what going to let me sleep at night which I thought was a good piece of advise. I am curious though...why do they think your risk for recurrance is high? Thank you for the warm wishes TifJ!!! and here is to us 1 year from now!!  Robin...I debuted my wig yesterday at work with very nice feedback( at least they were nice enough to say so!)  I will next in line for the shave.  Good for you taking charge!!!  To the other women I hope you are all doing well and as I have mentioned before...thank you for being a part of this ride.",

This is surely and emotional and physical rollarcoster and I have had some pretty overwhelming emotions and fears as some of you have been mentioning.  I am sure it is all part of the process but I am looking forward to meeting with a Oncology Psychiatrist  in a couple of weeks to help with the coping.  Good luck to all as we continue our fight!",

I know somehow they mean well but I'm tired of hearing how good I look as though I should look like a fragile sick old lady.  I also wonder when I will feel like me again.  Will it be once my hair grows back?  That won't be for months.  The last infusion isn't when it's all over.  I, like you, have another surgery mid March to have my TE's exchanged for permanent implants. I also worry how the Arimidex I will be taking will affect me.  I hear lots of complaints of joint and bone pain with it and I have flashbacks of my first Neulasta shot which was debilitating before I knew about the Claritin...UGH!!!!

You can get through these next days of YUCK know it's your last!!

I know it will be a few weeks yet before feeling like yourself, but there is light! CKK did you make it to your party?  How are you feeling today Madison? Rachel, your long days make me tired girl.  I hope that some R&R is in your weekend. I have been mulling over the paraben thing for a while now and switched body washes(which currently serves as shampoo too), checked my deodorant(using the crystal thing) but it wasn't until it was brought up here that I took a look at my make-up and anti-aging potions.  I didn't even think of the toothpaste.  I did find parabens in my foundation but I put so many layers of creams on my face prior to that, that I am hoping it can seep in.  Of course I just bought new foundation, and I like what I use.  The next time I go to Sephora, however, I am going to ask about a paraben free make over.  Gracie is there a Sephora by you?  They have a great return policy if something doesn't agree with your skin. I had an abdominal ultrasound yesterday because I have been having an intermittent burning in my upper right abd, below my ribs that was gnawing at my \"is it somewhere else\" mind frame.  I was much relieved to get a clean report.  I swear this BC is going to wreak more havoc on my head than my body. Planning for a low key, get some rest weekend.  I have a friend who came from Minneapolis yesterday to spend the weekend with me and hang out.  My son is gone to a church retreat and being alone makes for a miserable time with too much time to think.  I hope that everyone else is doing OK and has a decent weekend if you are in the \"good\" zone.",

I have had no other choice but to be out and about enjoying it!! I went to our St. Patrick's Day parade yesterday and YES!!! a wig is hot!!!  I was ready to go Sinead O'Conner and whip it off I have read through past posts but I'm sure I will forget something. Rachel, I'm confessing to referencing your last post. Robin-that is one long drive you have and like Rachel asked, I was wondering if you are driving alone or is someone taking you? Karen...I will be thinking of you tomorrow with the exchange.  I have to say this is much easier than the BMX and no drains! Lisa I think you asked about that.  The reason for no supplements prior to surgery is that some supplements can have blood thinning effects or have reactions with anesthesia which of course they want to avoid. It will be over before you know it!!  While I'm thinking about it, someone questioned about the shortness of breath and anemia.  Yes it is a side effect of anemia.  The red blood cells carry the oxygen in the blood stream so it's directly related. Wave...you showing up at rads all green gave me a chuckle!! I'm sorry to hear that it was a tough day for you.  I have been having more chemo brain episodes myself. I feel flighty a lot. Ckk-  how did chaperoning go?  I had know idea you have been keeping up with weight training through all of this.  Hat's off to you girlfriend!!  Lisa...For sure you want to be 100% going into your next surgery.  I'm with Rachel,  I wonder now if a DIEP wouldn't have been better.  My implants feel good but I still wonder. I agree with getting some happy stuff on the tube.  I can barely stand to watch TV these days...too depressing or ridiculous or violent.A BCTV channel with nothing but up beat stuff on it would be nice.  Mom,  I will be keeping my fingers crossed that you can get started with rads a little earlier. I also had lingering pain where my drains were.  It scared me because it was in the same area as where my tumor was(only it hurt on both sides so I knew it wasn't that).  Gracie,  great job on the walking!! It will only get easier but listen to your body too. Bailey...I like the idea of a sassy wig.  I'm in the market for a new one too.  I found one online that was short and pixie that I thought I might get to ease the transition to the short do.  With any luck it might not be a hot as my current one.  My hair is definitley coming in all over now.  It doesn't look like I have the mange! I would say it's about 1/16th of an inch!! Karmil,  glad to hear you are giving yourself time to rebound.  I posted about the vitamins and surgery under Karen.  When is your surgery?  .Rachel...your house sounds like a never ending revolving door!!  I do hope you are not pushing yourself too much.  Take this next week and a half to get as strong as you can!  We will be waiting here for you to cross that finish line. I took advantage of this time off of work and treated myself to a new car on Friday. I won't get it until sometime this week.  I will be broke now so I may have to drive where ever we decide on meeting even though gas prices are not much better!! Take care everyone!! ",
