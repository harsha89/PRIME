I have white cotton gloves, cera vie cream and a petroleum based cream. I have compazine, imodium on hand and zofran refill available. I am going out of town for a daughter's horse show this coming weekend. I am debating whether to take the Xeloda starting today when I get it or wait 7 more days. Until after the show. I have not had chemo since the end of September. Would waiting a week be stupid? Lord knows, i don't want to give any random floaters a chance to settle in as mets. What would you do? Be nervous and uncomfortable out of town or wait until in the comfort of home to start? End breast cancer by 2020.
