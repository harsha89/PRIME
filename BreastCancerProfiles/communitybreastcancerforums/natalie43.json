Throughout the six and a half weeks of treatments I walked for a little over three miles every morning (averaging about 3.5 mph) and swam laps for 30-45 minutes every afternoon. Shortly after the last treatment a strange wave of what I guess would be called fatigue swept over me. I don't have it all the time, but when it is going to sweep over me is unpredictable. The only time I know it WON'T be a problem is when I'm exercising. I'm still doing my 3+ miles of morning walking and my afternoon swimming since the exercise makes me feel better, not worse. I *hate* the strange feeling when the fatigue sweeps over me. (My last radiation treatment was on August 13, and I started taking Femara yesterday.)",
