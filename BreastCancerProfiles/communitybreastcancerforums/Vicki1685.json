Glad to here your mum id doing well this week, reading your reply so sounds liek my mum, shes not been on her 02 as much this week and her coughing has got alot better. We saw the oncologist friday just before her 2nd chemo and he examined mum and hes said the breast tumor has shrunk 4cms on the first lot of chemo which were all over the moon about, he was really pleased with how well shes responded to the chemo-some good news at last! He was more concered about her breathing and gave her some really good cough medicen which has helped alot, if you like I can find out the name of it as it may help your mum aswell?  Mum has metastaic breast cancer- i think thats the name for it! like what the docs have advised you they have said they can control it and have also not told us how long she can fight it for, which is a good thing, as most stage 4 cancers they usualy give you a time frame. Mums not started her bone treatment yet as she needs 5 teeth out before they can start the treatment but doc didnt seem to worried about it! So if hes not worried were not worried lol  What type does your mum have? Im doing okay, still hasnt sunk in yet even tho we shaved her hair on sunday it still doesnt seem real, just trying to keep myself busy at all times, dont like to stop and think, how about you? How are you feeling? xxx",

She to wears liners and trickles all the time bless her, onc have given her cough syrup that seems to be helping a little, she also has an oxygen tank at home which she says hels a great deal, maybe its worth asking your doc for one? Onc also said the coughing should wear off after a few rounds of chemo so far shes had 2 lots and not really noticed any change, recently shes been coughing up flem and small bits of food from were shes coughing so much, im guessing its the crap clearing of her lungs as she WAS a smoker for 20yrs I hope this info helps! :-) xxx",
