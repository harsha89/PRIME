The MRI showed a shadow and so I had an immediate core biopsy. I'd had one a year earlier and this was benign.  So, having waited anxiously for results for the last 5 days, the doctor finally called to say it's again \"benign.\"  Yippee, but, he then tells me that a secondary suspicious area showed up in the mammogram report & I have to come back in for a sterotactic biopsy.  The suspicious finding was \"microcalcifications\"...not sure how scared I should be??? After googling for awhile, I've found out that micro is worse than macro, but can anyone help me further.  My husband has pancreatic cancer, with liver and bone metastatis.  I don't think our family could/can handle another cancer diagnosis.  Thanks and hugs to all on this site,  nikki Nikki Log in to post a reply",

I'm glad you're doing well now, though! Superscared (what's your name?), thanks, too, for this really useful site.  Certainly answered most of my questions.  I'm going to call my clinic today and see if I can get a copy of the report, with pics. When will you have answers about your own tests? Despite trying not to worry, I found I couldn't sleep at all last night. Tired, tired, tired... nikki",
