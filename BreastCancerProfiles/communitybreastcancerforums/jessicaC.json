It came back and went straight to her bones. She is 53. She's got spots from her skull to her ankles. She's a strong woman, but the doctor wants her now to try Chemo and she's reluctant. I can understand why, due to what it did to her so long ago. She wants to try Spirulina and Chlorella. I'll support her with whatever she wants to do, but I was wondering if any one of you have tried this or know more about it than I do.",
