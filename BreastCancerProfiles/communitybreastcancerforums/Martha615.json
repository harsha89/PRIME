I think my body is going through a kind of estrogen surge. I had fewer menstrual and pre-menstrual symptoms when I was 45 than now at 50. My period is on time, no hot flashes, nothing. I am trying to eat the right foods to help my body metabolise the estrogen better, so I am having no coffee, alcohol, sugar. I am eating a ton of broccoli and other cooked cruciferous vegetables. That might help and certainly cannot hurt. Supplements include high potency turmeric, a multi, vitamin D and K, and I am considering DIM, though there I came across some papers on that which make me wonder if that is good or bad. As I have fibroids and they are pretty big, I know what my estrogen levels are up as I can feel them more, so I hope it is not too crazy to imagine they are a kind of guide. Again, thank you!",

My investigation was done in London at the Princess Grace Hospital and the pathology report comes from University College Hospital. It is not as detailed a report as you might receive in America.

I know it is so hard not to worry, but from what I've read about benign breast disease, it is quite common to have these sorts of lumps in young women. If you google fibroadenoma you'll find you are just the age to get one, while getting breast cancer at your age is quite rare. Your mother hasn't had breast cancer -- that's good! -- and your 70 year grandmother isn't a significant factor in your risk assessment unless she had ovarian cancer as well. Hang in there!!!",

I hear aspirin can be useful if you can tolerate it. Omega 3's found in fish oil and/or walnuts. Pomegranates are very good for some reason I can't remember. There is some conflicting evidence that freshly ground linseeds (flax seeds) help in cases of an abundance of estrogen. Little/no red meat. Of course, no alcohol as you already know. As far as I was aware on dairy, there may only be a problem there if you already had a tumor. Everything I am mentioning here is what you will probably already have heard. Few studies and what there is mostly corresponds to mice, but increasingly we are seeing evidence that some dietary intervention and lifestyle choices can help protect us. No guarantees, of course. Is there a chance for you to take tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor? That will substantially lower your risk (tamoxifen has long lasting positive effects even after the 5 years you would take it).",

Interestingly, I just spoke to the geneticist who arranged for my Color genetics testing. I don't know how Color compares to other testing, but apparently I did not have any known mutations associated with breast cancer. This doesn't entirely surprise me, though it isn't all that helpful as I don't know if those with breast cancer in my family carry any mutations, so my *not* carrying them may mean little. The geneticist told me that it is estimated that 10% of breast cancers are from genes not yet known to us. Having really annoying fibrocystic breasts may mean I have a different relationship to my breasts than women have pain-free breasts. It's difficult to feel everything is fine when it hurts. For example, I have a 1.7 cm cyst that I was convinced was pathological (the ultrasound suggests otherwise, just a simple fluid-filled cyst that is located right under my nipple) and so I am very, very familiar with the lumps/bumps, good-lord-what-is-this scenario I might have post bmx. The truth is no doctor has suggested to me anything other than surveillance, adding an annual MRI into the mix. I hate surveillance. It feels like being a sitting duck. I do understand the rationale, however.",

I don't have all my results back from genetic testing but this is my history: My mother was dx'ed with IDC at age 52 but she neglected her screening and the tumour was large and easily seen with the naked eye, let alone a mammogram. I suspect she had IDC in her late 40's even. My only full sister had complicated breasts and opted for a PBMx after a dx of pleomorphic LCIS, age 48. My only half-sister (different mother, same father) was dx'ed with HER2+ at 55. Both maternal great aunts had bc sometimes in their 50's but I don't know when exactly. The remaining women are my mother's grandmother and my mother's sister, who did not have ever have breast cancer. My full sister and I are BRCA negative but it isn't a \"true negative\" as we were the only ones tested (about 10 years ago). I only share 25% of my genes with my half-sister. Unfortunately, I am not aware of any genetic testing on her part. I'm 55. I have class C dense breasts and lots of fibrocystic breast changes, including a 1.7cm simple cyst that is sometimes annoying. I am awaiting the results of a further panel of genetic tests (Color). My Gail score is 25% lifetime risk. My Tyrer Cruzick score is 35.9% lifetime risk. As far as I am aware I have no hyperplasia, though I did have a biopsy a few years ago which was just very dense tissue that looked liked a mass on the ultrasound. I've developed a real phobia about breast cancer. While I don't want to over-estimate my risk or act rashly, I also feel like a sitting duck. I've been getting annual mammograms and ultrasounds. I do not qualify for annual MRIs. I feel as though I am simply waiting for the diagnosis and that I would be better off taking pro-active measures. I'm not keen on tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors but would prefer a prophylactic surgery here in the UK, paid for by myself. No particular interest in reconstruction because I don't want further surgeries. While my onco surgeon is willing to do it based on my history and my wish not to go through cancer treatment, I have little (no) support from anyone close to me. They think I'd be putting myself through an unnecessary amputation and that I'm frankly nuts. I am aware statistically that a surgical solution will be unlikely to significantly extend my life but I am somehow convinced that I will get breast cancer and end up with surgery anyway (plus all the cancer treatment). Whatever I do I will live with uncertainty. My preference is to take action to prevent the disease but I am not so arrogant that I discount the opinions of those who feel I am over-estimating my risk. It's difficult to take a proactive measure when there is little support from those around you to do so. Even \"simple\" Mx carries its own risks, as do all surgeries. I am aware of that. I am also aware of mastectomy pain syndrome. A friend of mine suffers from this from only a lumpectomy. Any thoughts from you very experienced people who know exactly what I'm talking about and have some words of wisdom for me? Many thanks in advance! Log in to post a reply",

I am SO sorry about your troubles from only having had 2 nodes taken!

I know that someone without the level of disease you are experiencing can't imagine what that would be like. Indeed, it is very difficult to remove a breast without certainty that by doing so we will benefit greatly, or at least suffer less. The trouble with \"prophylactic\" surgery (an awful term) is that it requires exactly that. Once we have breast cancer -- or rather, once it metastasizes, there is less argument for removing a breast. Endocrine therapy, chemotherapy and the fact that the primary tumour has already done its damage spread to another location are a few. My mother had so many nodes taken -- I can't recall the number now but a lot. All were clear. She had mets to the liver anyway. Early 50s. Very sad.  Of course, you know all this, and much more than I know, besides.  I am sorry about your experience. I wish something more could be done about this disease. In my case, I'm waiting for a genetics panel and thinking hard about whether I really care that much about having breasts. Because I don't. Maybe I ought to; maybe other women do care. For me, they are often a source of worry and irritation (since the onset of menopause the cysts are almost always a little painful). I am aware that chronic post-mastectomy pain syndrome can hurt a hell of a lot more, however. Also, that a person like you hurts all the time, and so unjustly. I wish you the very best and, again, am sorry about your condition.",

It's more about how to deal with the consequences of whatever decision is made. Here in the UK we more conservative about medical intervention. You wouldn't be offered a Mx on the NHS for anything other than invasive cancer, I imagine. That reflects the UK's own economics with regard to medical intervention but also a deeper philosophic position about the role of surgery and risk-reduction in our lives. If I go forward with a risk-reducing surgery I'd be very much an anomaly, which is okay, but may make it a bit harder the first days and weeks and months afterwards to cope with my discomfort and appearance. On the other hand, I feel that those of us with high risk are kind of living with the disease already in that it is present in our minds, so the relief would be welcome. I am seeing two professionals about the surgery -- one a psychologist and, of course, the other a gene counsellor. I look forward to the gene counselling but I think the psychologist is just a routine screening that my surgeon requires. I have been told many times that risk-reducing surgery of this type does not extend one's life. I dived into the studies and most of them are about contralateral surgery on the healthy breast, but I have found some on risk-reducing bilateral surgery. It's true we don't gain a great number of years by doing prophylactic surgery at my age (55) but then we also don't have to take aromatase inhibitors or other drugs that make us feel crap. We don't have to deal with potential breast cancer treatment, node dissection or lymphedema (always a chance of that, of course, even with PBMx). So, there is a quality of life to consider. Farmerlucy, you ask about a \"true negative\". If your primary relative tests positive for a known mutation and you do not, it is called a \"true negative\" as it is assumed the mutation caused the primary relative's disease. Without that mutation, your risk is as it would be in the general population (assuming you don't have another known mutation or other risk factor). So, that is a \"true negative\". If your primary relative does not have a known gene or does not test, your own negative result isn't necessarily clearing you of a genetic predisposition within your family and so the result is not a \"true negative\". I hope that makes sense. At your suggestion I did try to find out what an MRI costs at the clinic where I'm treated. I think it was something under $2000 anyway. I haven't actually been told yet, still working on it! Thank you both for your thoughts. I really don't want to get bc so that I can then say \"Oh, look, I was right! I really should have had that Pbmx!\" We'll see what the Color panel shows. :) ",
