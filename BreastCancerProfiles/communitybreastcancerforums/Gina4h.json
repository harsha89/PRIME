      "Content": "May 20, 2018 02:30PM - edited May 20, 2018 02:34PM by Gina4h I was just diagnosed with radiation-induced brachial plexopathy. I went to ER because I thought my arm was broken. My elbow to wrist is so painful I wanted to cut it off and my hand varies between numb and burning pins and needles. The ER doctor told me to take lots and lots of marijuana and tell my neurologist about it. I'm seeing a neurologist because I started having seizures (yay me). The neurologist diagnosed RIBP and is sending me for an EMG and MRI. My family doc thinks it might be caused by arthritis, but the prognosis is the same - progressive loss of the use of my hand and arm:( The anti-seizure meds may help once I get up to a full dose. other than that it is Lyrica or Gabapentin I guess. Marijuana helps a bit but not much. Does the pain eventually go away? I developed lymphedema in the last few months also, but now I find I cannot wear my sleeve. It irritates the already irritated nerves and I end up riping it off after a few minutes. I used to be able to wear it for up to 12 hours.",

      "Content": "Gina4h wrote: Just need to rant and rave a bit. I developed a severe infection after a breast and lymph node biopsy. This has meant waiting in urgent care for my breast to be checked and my IV to be checked and changed if needed for six of the past nine days (the other days a nurse came to my home). Today I got through the clerk and the triage nurse really quickly and then sat in an examination room for 3 1/2 hours even though I was supposed to be fast tracked. At that point a nurses aid came in looking for something and I jokingly said \"if I slash my wrist do you think a doctor will see me?\" This turned out to be a big mistake! I saw the Dr. soon after. He decided they should do IV antibiotics for a few more days and all was fine until I told the nurse I have an allergy to adhesives. I asked about options if there was something she could use to reduce the amount of tape and if I could maybe get it changed more often because I have an infection from the last one that was left in for four days. She told me I couldn't leave until I had seen someone from psych. She said the nurses aids told her I was going to cut my wrists. Apparently that combined with the questions were a sign that I wanted to hurt myself. I told her I was very frustrated after spending five hours there and then having my questions and concerns ignored. Luckily the doc came by and I asked to speak to him again and I told him what was going on. He asked me if I was suicidal I said no just frustrated. He answered my questions and figured out an option for less tape and sent me home instead of to a psych ward! The thought of returning there on Wednesday morning does make me suicidal I'm seeing my BC surgeon Monday morning and I'm hoping she has another option. The longest waiting time to have my breast checked was six hours and the shortest has been three. Oh well it gives me lots of time to dwell on the fact that I have breast-cancer and it has spread to lymph nodes and life is just going to be peachy for the next little while. On a positive note I found the forum \"OMG they found the cure for stupid\" I strongly advise anyone needing a laugh to visit that forum.

I got a phone call from the hospital social worker today she was following up on my visit yesterday after speaking to me she said she was going to investigate the procedures at urgent care and said she probably would have reacted the same way. Unfortunately the nurse did such a bad job with the IV that my home care nurse had to remove it this morning so now I have to get a new one again. I have an appointment with my BS tomorrow morning and I'm going to see what she suggests. I am not not not going back to that urgent care! ",

New guidelines are being set up for maximum times that a patient can be without clinical contact and patients are to be given estimates of when the doctor will see them, with updates if things change. She said that she had been working on a new system, but my complaints and her talks with staff to resolve them, have made her push the changes through sooner. I just hope it actually works.",

Knowing this keeps me going. I know that if I continue to work at it, the PMPS will also be under control eventually. I will never be able to go back to my old life, but as I learned before, that's okay. I discovered that I enjoyed working with my brain and found exercise programs that worked for me. I walked over an hour every day most days closer to 2 hours - in the morning, after work and then again before bed. I'm beginning to get back into walking although it is only for a maximum or 20 minutes right now that will improve.
