It was worse outdoors and especially in the sun. I woke up in the morning looking like I'd been crying all night. I tried eyedrops and natural tears but that didn't help. Things got better by my last treatment and resolved completely shortly after. Hopefully the problems you are having are only temporary as well.",

But I got a new wig last month that I love and I often forget I'm wearing it (I guess I'm just used to wearing wigs now). Sadly, it does look better than the hair I had. I have to say I'm super excited that my real hair seems to have a bit of curl to it. All my life I've had really straight hair so this is great. And no grey, which surprised me since I had a little bit before. At least now that I know what real bad hair days are I'll probably never complain about that again. Does anyone have or is anyone planning on getting hair extensions? How long does your hair have to be?",
