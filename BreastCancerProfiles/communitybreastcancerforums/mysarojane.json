Had another at 36 as we had moved and my Dr. wanted a baseline, also had u/s, all clean. Dr. retired 2008, new Dr. wanted another as it'd been 2 years. I'm 38. Went for my mammo on 10/6. Piece of cake. Received a call from my clinic yesterday morning asking me to call back at an extention, anyone can help you. Called back and sure enough, it was radiology. They said the radiologist wanted me to have another mammo to get some more films. Scheduled for 10/27. Then I got to thinking, I need to know why. Left a msg for my Dr. requesting info. Then called back to radiology and started asking questions. All they would tell me is that the radiologist found a density in my left breast. Don't worry, we don't want you to worry, blah blah blah. Try telling the sun not to shine! I always was assuming and paranoid that since my mother had it, I'd get it. But then they call you back for a follow up and, wow! Never *really* expected it! Now I know the odds are good that it's nothing. But, should I be doing more? Asking other questions? Or just wait and see for now? Log in to post a reply",
