After my first infusion I felt ok, the second was a little worse and after my third I missed two days of work following my treatment with nausea. Is this cumulative? I have an appt with my onc on Monday but thought Id ask ladies who are actually on it? Also does anyone get a metallic taste in their mouth every once in awhile? May need to ask about that too. I go for my CT scan on Monday as well. Im hoping to have good results like Ive seen on here. Can anyone recommend nausea meds that actually work? Good luck to all on here. I pray for everyone dealing with cancer and their families.",

This is what I found: In cancer treatment, nadir commonly refers to the lowest point that an individual's blood cell count will reach as a side effect of chemotherapy or radiation therapy. The nadir for each blood cell type occurs at different time. Ive experienced fatigue and no appetite. My nose is a little bloody when I blow, but not a full on nose bleed. Go for my second infusion on Feb 5. Hope I do as well as alot of woman on here are doing. Going through this again sucks but a lot of positive vibes on these forums!!!",

I have the same type of cancer Er-/Pr-, Her2+ and metastasized to my lymph nodes and brain. Starting my 4th treatment Tuesday. What is the Her2climb trial? Thanks for any info",

Not sure if its allergies or chemo for they both started around the same time. I read up on side effects and saw bloody noses but not runny. Never had a full on nose bleed but have had some blood when I would blow. Im going for my 5th cycle next Tuesday so far pretty tolerable I feel bloated and queasy the night of and about 1-2 days after treatment. So much better feeling then my first go around with the harsh chemos, the losing the hair, constant nausea for like a week, and the Neulasta injections. Good luck and so many prayers to who are living or caring for someone with this terrible disease.",
