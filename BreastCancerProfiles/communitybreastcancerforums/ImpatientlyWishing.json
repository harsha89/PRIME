    "Content": "ImpatientlyWishing wrote: A little over a month ago after getting out of the shower I noticed my left breast had a bloody discharge that was a constant flow. After an hour it finally stopped. I have been having an awful pain in my left breast since. It comes and goes but it's an every day thing. When it hurts it is like a someone is sticking me with a needle slowly in and out for hours on end. I went into the doctor after having the discharge the next day and she said that my breasts felt different from each other and it was very worrisome. So I went in for a mammogram, ultrasound and galactagam. They were unable to do the galactagam as I was not bleeding at the time. After the diagnostic mammogram I had an ultrasound on the left breast only. She said she did not see anything. She left the room and then the nurse came back and said she wanted more shots on my right breast. So we went back and they did another mammogram of two shots with a glass cup pressed on me this time. The doc looked and said there were some spots that she wanted tested again in six months. So then I get the paper in the mail stating that they have found (we believe)benign spots and I should get another mammogram in six months to make sure they are still stable. I have no pain in my right breast where they found something but I still have pain in my left breast(which is sometimes unbareable) where they found nothing and now I'm with no imformation as to why. My sister is telling me I need to request a biopsy to make sure it is not cancerous in my right breast. I made an appt with my obgyn to get her second opinion(first time went to primary physician). So do I push for a biopsy or wait six months for another mammogram? One of my best friends just died on st party's day- she had Ewings sarcoma. She was 35 with four young children and one grandbaby. Having gone through everything with her including a leg amputation and now she was still taken from us it scares me. Holding my son and knowing her babies will never feel their mothers arms around them again makes me want to go running to the doctor right now saying find out what is wrong with me NOW! I know I'm acting crazy though. I just don't know what to do and don't want to overreact when most likely it is nothing. Sorry this is so long. Any suggestions?? oh also the pain will feel like a wet burning feeling inside my breast. Left breast was significantly larger than right but it seems to have gone down some but still hurts. And for about four months the skin on both breasts has looked different. Like I laid on something and indented myself with small little square pattern only always there and gets worse around side of breast. Log in to post a reply",
