My mother was diagnosed at the age of 58. She is now about to turn 80. She also went through the same treatment as my sister. Her cancer was progesterone dependent. Now my sister Sally, the light of so many people's lives, has been diagnosed with Triple Negatve breast cancer. I hope that the brutal but life saving treatments that saved my mom and sister Anne can save Sally. I am the only member of my family that hasn't been personally attacked by this vicious fucking disease. It took my dad in 1994. I do take it personally as I sit here crying for my sister hoping it never strikes my daughter or wife or son. I am sure I will see it again. Fuck it Log in to post a reply",
