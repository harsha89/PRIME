You don't have to go in for a visit -- just have the lab send the report and slides to Johns Hopkins and they'll give you a second opinion with 2-5 days.  It is also covered by Medicare and may be covered by health insurance.  Their phone number to get instructions faxed to you is 410-955-2405. I'm doing this for my mom after a mistake at our local path lab. We were originally told she was positive, positive, negative and would only need hormonal therapy; a week later, we were told she was triple negative and chemo was her only option.  Log in to post a reply",
