I worked through all of my treatment and it was the best thing I ever did. The support of the staff and students was invaluable. I shared my whole journey with my kids and the staff. It was very therapeutic. I missed school on chemo days, a week for each surgery(two), and once I missed four days when I had an allergic reaction to chemo. Other than that, it was pretty doable. I had to leave early a few times for side effects that got to me but those incidents were few and far between. It's a personal decision obviously but working and cancer can be done. Good luck, I will be thinking of you.",
