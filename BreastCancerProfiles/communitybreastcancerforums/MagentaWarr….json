I'm on my second go-round of breast cancer and decided against reconstruction both times. Having recently had a second mastectomy, I've tossed out prostheses (they're heavy and expensive) and again have pretty bras from Coobie. Super comfortable. I thought you might be interested in Knitted Knockers (google it, maybe?), which is a genius idea from Washington State. I made my own \"prostheses\" by crochet and they're light and comfortable, even only two weeks out of surgery. Maybe you and others might be interested in creating some? I'm far from thrilled about having cancer a second time, but at least my bras and my \"knockers\" are comfortable and pretty! :)",
