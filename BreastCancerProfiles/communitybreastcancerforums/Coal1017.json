It was nothing. If anyone is having one and scared to death like me I swear there was nothing to it. They told me everything they were doing and said now they would take the tissue and I said tell me when and the dr said she was finished. I hope it turns out ok but like SD said at least I'll know and go from there. Again thank you so much <3 ",

I was like omg there is something. She said that sometimes they don't have you situated right on the machine, etc. That could be why the radiologist cleared you. Anyway another few views and it was still there. They did ultrasound and couldn't see it. I was lucky mine was just fibrous tissue.",

      "Content": "Jan 19, 2019 09:20AM Coal1017 wrote: There is an area of architectural distortion best seen on the right CC view on slice 20 to 29/68. This persists on the additional spot tomosynthesis views that were obtained and is located at the upper-outer quadrant likely at the 11-12 axis middle to posterior depth. There is no associated central mass. A subsequent right breast ultrasound reveals no focal sonographic correlate. However, given the area of architectural distortion a stereotactic guided biopsy under 3-D tomosynthesis is suggested. Results and recommendations were discussed with the patient and the patient was given a written copy of the recommendation and advised to follow up with her referring physician. A written copy of the recommendations was also faxed to the referring physician's office and this report was prioritized for faster delivery. BREAST ULTRASOUND: Sonographic evaluation of the right breast was performed targeted both to the upper outer quadrant and the subareolar region of the right breast where the patient's physician felt a lump. In the subareolar region of the right breast there is a 2.3 x 1.9 x 1.5 cm simple cyst which is mammographically stable since prior studies. No mammographic correlate to the area of architectural distortion is identified in the upper-outer quadrant of the right breast. IMPRESSION: Above-described findings are felt to be suspicious. RECOMMENDATION: Stereotactic biopsy. Stereotactic guided biopsy on the right under 3-D guidance. ASSESSMENT: BI-RADS Category 4: Suspicious findings.",

I have dense breasts with a lot of cysts and often have gotten called back. Always scared to death. This was the first time for a biopsy. The radiologist said whatever it is it is very small which is a good thing. I'm wondering if architectural distortion is a new thing since the introduction of the 3d mammogram which sees things better. Good luck!!",
