The culprit was one of the pre-medications. Is your aunt on any medication? Does she have epilepsy? Does the Dr. at rads know about the seizures? Does she have a neurologist? Here's a link for what to do during seizures www.webmd.com/epilepsy/tc/help... I have a few seconds warning and will do whatever it takes to get flat so I don't fall and crack my head open ( again!). Hope something here helps somehow.",
