Im 29 years old and I have a history of cancer on my mother side My Aunt ( Mom's sister) was DX at 48 with BC in one breast had cemo then it came back in the other breast then it spread through out her body and she passed away at 50. My Grandma( My Mom's mom) was DX at 65 had her breast removed she went into remission for 8 years then it came back in the other breast and she passed away at 75. Im not 100% positive on this but my Mom's other sister I was told had the BRAC test and was positive but her Dr would not remove her breasts.. I will find out tomorrow after my Mom talks to her sister to see if she was for sure DX with the mutation. My Mom wont get tested I have 2 half sisters from my Mom as well that would benifit from getting tested as well. My father was DX with prostate cancer at the age of 56 and passed away at 60.Â  I have heard that prostate cancer runs in the same mutation or something like that. Does anyone know if my insurance company will cover the BRAC test for me? Log in to post a reply",
