I'd like to see much more research on this topic rather than more awareness - which in my case, awareness didn't help at all. While reading on line I came upon the funniest article.  The author starts the article by describing an elderly lady who discovered her own small, early stage breast cancer.  She only needed a lumpectomy - no chemo or rads.  Hurray Hurray.  Then later in the article it talks about the futility of breast self exam INCLUDING the fact that those of us who don't have early stage cancers feel guilty.  IMO classic case of why we feel guilty when we don't discover our own tumors.  We are subtly and not so subtly being told that is is our fault, even though there is no scientific data to support this belief. http://articles.cnn.com/2009-11-17/health/breast.cancer.self.exams_1_breast-cancer-routine-mammograms-cancer-awareness?_s=PM:HEALTH",

More commonly, chemo as well as menopause can cause dry eyes which often leads to excessive tearing.  I definitely experienced this myself.  Simple things you can try are to use artificial tears such as systane, refresh or blink 4 times a day.  An ointment at night such as gentel gel can also help.  I added a humidifier to my room.  Avoid fans which increase evaporative loss.  I think the lid scrubs as described in the previous post are also a good idea as they are safe and cheap.  You can use dilated baby shampoo.  There are also pads to cleanse your lids which are sold in the store near the artificial tears. If you are still symptomatic after using the tears and lid scrubs, I would see an ophthalmologist. Good Luck",
