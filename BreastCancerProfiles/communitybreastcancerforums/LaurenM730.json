It takes a lot just to move around in bed or go to the bathroom. I just got my drains out on Monday night and I feel like that set me back with some additional pain How is everyone else doing during their recovery?",

I hope today is just as good for you.  You deserve to feel this way.  Happy 2nd day back! Lauren",
