    "Content": "Eishaxox wrote: hey everyone, I have had a veryÂ full on fortnight, 2 weeks ago the main thing on my mind was trying to fall pregnant after a year of trying, from the time I ovulated 2 weeks ago I found out I might have early breast cancer (heading in for a memmogram today) and also found out I am FINALLY pregnant. But now I'm freaking out! If I'm pregnant would I still be able to receive radiotherapy? Would I need to postpone the therapy or terminate the pregnancy? I really hope not! Sorry for being so long, I just want to know if anyone has been pregnant while receiving the therapy? Thanks. Log in to post a reply",
