I am doing RADS after chemo's done so I'm trying to get into the Rhode Island Hospital 3-1/2 week new trial instead of the 6-1/2 week usual one.  I just want all this to be over.  I'd rather drive the 1-1/2 hrs. to RI than do the 10 min. drive here for 6-1/2 weeks.  Going to RI for an appt. on 11/11.  Already lined up 10 drivers in case I do it.  That's one blessing I've discovered, reconnecting with friends.  The friend who's gone to 2 chemos with me was my childhood friend.  Although she lives about 1-1/2 hrs. away, with traffic, it took her 3-1/2 yesterday.   We had a ball though, it was like being out with a friend, never knew I was in the chemo room and had no trouble with veins this time!

On the wig/hat issue, I'll chime in with voting for the hats.  I hate my wig, it's so uncomfortable and gives me a headache.  I only wear it if I shop locally or go to a restaurant.  I don't like people staring at me.  The other day I was in a store and was wearing a scarf and a woman came up to me and asked me if I was in the sisterhood. I said, \"what?\" She said, \"do you have cancer?\"  I said yes and she proceeded to tell me that she was wearing a wig.  So I guess not only does a turban  scream cancer, so does a scarf, lol.  I always have hats and scarves in the car because when my head gets hot in a hat, I like the scarves.  It's getting pretty cold here in the northeast though so hats are it for me.  I got a couple of free ones at the hospital.  One is a terrycloth turban that I wear to bed, so comfy.  I bought 3 at the dollar store and several more cheap at Target, and a couple of scarves at Bldg. 19 and a couple at headcovers.com.  Oddly enough, two of my friends said I look better with fuzz than hair, kind of a left-handed compliment, don't know what that says about my old hairdo.  The other day I was at the pool, got out of the shower and a cute little boy asked me if I was a girl, so funny.  One thing that's good is wearing a scarf or a turban when you're out helps people realize that chemo is doable, you can get on with your life. it lessens the fear.  I think some people have preconcieved notions that chemo is really horrible, much like it was years ago.

So don't be afraid, make your decision with conviction and don't look back.  Cancer is so unpredictable. For example, 30% of people with negative nodes end up with metastasis down the road.  So you just don't know.  Peeps",

They were going to present my caset to a group of drs this afternoon, but when I found out that they've never radiated anyone's axilla, I wouldn't want to be in it anyways because my biggest fear is lymphedema, not recurrence, and they said it may increase the risk of that with the stronger dose.  I'm already doing chemo, then radiation, then hormone therapy to prevent recurrence. Is there anyone else out there who refused the 2nd surgery (axilla nodes) and then did chemo and radiation to both the breast and the axilla?   Peeps   Dx 6/20/2008, IDC, 1cm, Stage IIA, Grade 2, 1/2 nodes, ER+/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I took a diabetes ed class at my local hospital and it was very informative.  I can't believe how many people out there still believe that diabetes happens because of eating too much sugar.  The most valuable piece of advice I got from the class was the #1 thing to read on a food label is \"serving size\".  The next thing is the carbs.  A good snack should have approximately 15 carbs and a good meal should have 45 carbs.  You can eat almost whatever you want but in small portions.  Do you have specific questions?  I adapted my stuffed cabbage recipe to incorporate ground turkey instead of beef, etc.  Pasta seems to raise my sugar more than anything else so I try to avoid it.  If I get chicken parm when I'm out to eat, I'll ask for a salad instead. Kashi cereal is really good for fiber in the morning.  You can subtract fiber from the carbs to get a true carb count.

I too believe this is kind of uncharted territory and since there was little response to this thread, I believe it is probably because when you sign the form for your sentinel node biopsy, you usually consent to the axillary node dissection if the cancer is found in the sentinel nodes at surgery.  Since only 20% is found after surgery at the final pathology, it gives us time to rethink the axillary node surgery. With the risk of lymphedema,  I think more patients are becoming educated and are questioning these procedures which don't make sense. Nanova, was it also your opinion that the dissection of the other nodes was unlikely to tell them anything else or was that also your dr.'s opinion? Peeps ",
