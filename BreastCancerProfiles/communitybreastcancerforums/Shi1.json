Both breast have scattered fibroglandular tissue. I am 58 yrs old and this is my first mammogram. the report also states that my right breast has focal asymmetry 9 millimeter. my left breast has 3 asymmetric nodules 7mm, 4mm, and 3 mm. the locations are given in distance from the nipple. no microcalcifications. I am not sure, but I believe that no microcalcifications is a good thing? basically my question is, should I be concerned about the nodules, and what can they be? if it was bad, wouldn't the BIRADS be 3 or higher?

The ultrasound conclusion is that I have 6 cysts. So good news! I am shocked, but very much so relieved in the results. I have not had a menstrual cycle since I was 42 years old! As well, I never took HRT. I suppose weirder things can happen, but I am so relieved to have a clear bill of health at least for another year. I pray everyone else on this thread waiting gets the same good news! :-) hugs to everyone, support means everything in times of uncertainties!",
