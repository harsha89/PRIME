So I'm just looking for advice. for those of you that have had one, is there any information or advice you can pass along? How long did you wait for your results? The same radiologist that read my mammogram will be the one performing the procedure. They found another cyst in the left breast and these new microcalcifications. Any advice you can give is greatly appreciated! Log in to post a reply",

My bestie is taking me to the appointment Thank goodness. The hospital then I'm going to, actually uses a mobile biopsy clinic, it looks like a giant RV! The presence of a new cyst isn't as worrisome as these new calcifications. Knowing that ADH was found in both breasts 2 years ago also is concerning, as I wonder why these cells are continually changing. I will keep you posted! ",

In Aug they found a solid mass & complex cyst with debris @ 9oclock in the R, also with 2 groups of round punctate calcifications. I had a CNB and it came back as a sclerosing intraductal papilloma. I'm waiting to meet with a surgeon. I am now having pain in the R armpit area and it feels swollen, also right below my collarbone is swollen and painful to the touch. I thought it may have been irritation from the biopsy since it started 3 days after, but it has now been such for 3 weeks. I have a few questions: 1.Is this normal to have this pain etc? (this is the 3rd CNB on this breast and I have never had complications 2.If there is a complex cyst with debris, do they generally biopsy the cyst and fluid to see what the debris is? There was no microscopic info on the path report only the gross description and dx. Is it common to have both a mass and cyst in the same area? Can this mask possible malignancy?

Path reports came back as several papillomas in everything removed and ADH. Tonight, I was laying down and felt pain in my left arm pit. After inspecting, I noticed a small lump. soon pain began radiating in my shoulder and LT breast. Within 30 min, my entire breast felt like it was 20 lbs and became rock hard. It literally felt like it was a balloon that was about to pop. My nipple is hard and there was a lump that felt like a hard mass. They did and ultasound and stated that the spot where the mass was removed has filled with fluid. The measurement is 5.9 x 5.7 x 3.0 cm. Since i have no signs of infection, drainage, or fever, they released me and told me to f/u with my surgeon tomorrow. My post op appt is scheduled for monday. My entire breast is hurting and swollen. I also noticed a red rash on the breast. Has this happenend to any of you? I'm worried that I may have to have another surgery as I dont think that something this large can be aspirated.
