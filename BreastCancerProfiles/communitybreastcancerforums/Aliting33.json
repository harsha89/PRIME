I'm not sure yet what stage I'm in because I haven't had a formal discussion yet with my doctor. I had my first bilateral MRI and a painful mammogram yesterday. I also had an ultrasound and tomorrow I'm going in for genetic testing. I will be seeing my surgeon tomorrow so she can give me more details. I will make sure to return to this topic with updates.",
