I have been trying to work out why they are so painful and inflexible and only this morning did I see your post and look further into it being related to some chemotherapy treatments. I can see from other entries through Google search that it does not appear to be uncommon. It's strange that sharing an issue with others is somehow comforting. The pain is so bad at times that I cannot touch the area and the pain stretches up my lower leg through the calf which at times becomes quite cramped. I am applying an Asprin based cream for arthritis to the area which does provide some good relief. My first post treatment mamogram and follow up Oncologist/surgeon appointment after that and I will be discussing this Achilles issue and find out if there is anything that I could do to relieve the pain or stop the problem. I will try to remember to share the outcome with you and I hope that you will do the same if you come across anything?! Take very good care, Kerrie",
