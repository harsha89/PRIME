I had a biopsy on the 23 of June and my Brest is still really tender and sore since and I just want to know if this is typical or if I should contact my dr. She is on vacation till the 23 which is when I get my results.. I can always ask then if it is still bad. Sorry if this is s dumb question I'm and really have no one to talk to about any of this.
