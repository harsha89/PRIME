That happened my first round ( I was on blood pressure medicine) and it was my blood pressure plummeting. Got worse when I stood up. They have since taken me off of bp medicine and I have a monitor to watch it. It is dropping a little this time, but not as bad. I am sure that it is rare ( I am ususally an oddball) but worth checking into. Karen",

Hoping not to lose all of my top lashes. Did anyone keep some of them? My eyebrows are coming back gangbusters, short, but thick so hope the lashes do the same. Treatment 12 of my rads done (1/3 of the way) so far not so bad. Hope to continue that way. Starting to feel a little tired. Thinking positive thoughts. Karen",
