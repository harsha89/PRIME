I'm estrogen positive, tumor (< 2 cm.) was removed with clear margins, spread to lymph nodes which were removed.  I am having my ovaries removed as precaution and to eliminate the need for hormone pills.  I am curious about the need for Taxol....if I skip it, and also radiation, how much will that affect my long-term prognosis???
