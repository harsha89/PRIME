    "Content": "Jun 18, 2017 07:34PM - edited Jun 18, 2017 07:40PM by srmaryfreddo I had DCIS, negative nodes, bilateral mastectomy, no radiation or chemo. I have stable lung nodules that were followed with CT scans for two years. A year and a half ago the chest CT noted the right 7th & 8th ribs as \"healed fractures\". My PCP ordered a Bone density test which showed osteoporosis. So we attributed these fractures to that. Fast forward 1 year, chest CT shows same fractures but states that they are non-healing. 3 months later I start having rib pain on right side. After several weeks, X-rays show 7th,8th & 9th ribs with subacute(Old) fractures that are healing. So I question my PCP about the possibility that this is not due to osteoporosis. She ordered a bone scan. The rib area lit up and the results state \" probable healing rib fractures. Sclerotic metastasis within the differential diagnosis\". So I'm awaiting a response from my onco to whom I sent a detailed message of what's been going on. My question is, has anyone with DCIS, negative nodes had mets to the bone? Thanks for reading. srmaryfreddo",
