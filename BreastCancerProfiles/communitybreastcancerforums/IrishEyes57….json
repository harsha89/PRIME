I just started treatments this past Monday to my right breast (full breast). Yesterday was my 4th day - my treatments are in the evening. When I woke up yesterday morning, I felt a little dizzy getting out of bed, but didn't think anything of it. My cat sleeps with me and I had to kind of climb over her to get up - so I just chalked it up to that. Felt a little dizzy all day and a bit nauseous. Did my treatment last night and when I laid down and turned by head to the right, I felt very dizzy. Then when I got up from the table I had to catch myself from falling on the floor. I'm going to have a real nice bruise on my hip where I hit the table. The Tech yelled out for the Nurse right away. They had me sit and took my blood pressure 3 times before they let me leave. I had to convince them that I didn't feel like I was going to pass out - just felt dizzy. I am back at work today and feeling a bit better, but noticed last night in bed that if I tried to sleep on my left side, the dizzy feeling came right back. I just made sure to turn over, very slowly, to my right side (I hate sleeping on my back!) and I went right back to sleep with no problem. Today is Friday and my last treatment of the week. I am reading from others here that I will feel more normal over the weekend but might feel dizzy again by midweek next week after the treatments start again. This is not fun! And as others here have also said, no one, not the Tech, not the Nurse, said anything about it being related to the radiation.... why am I not surprised!!",
