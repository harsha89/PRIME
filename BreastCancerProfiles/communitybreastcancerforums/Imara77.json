Mammo showed it was 2.55cm but I am worried it could be bigger cause I have big dense breast. It is grade 1 of 3. What really has me worried is the upper back pain I have. It worries me that it has spread. I actually first felt this in Jan and went to PCP who did a digital exam and said she did not feel anything so I did not go to follow up mammo scheduled out of fear. But now I know but the back pain is what really has me freaked out. I did go to the doc for it in Jan as well and he said he felt a bulging disc and he did some manipulation and showed me exercises, During biopsy the doctor kept saying the mass was really deep so that just intensifies my fear of what is going on with my back Log in to post a reply",
