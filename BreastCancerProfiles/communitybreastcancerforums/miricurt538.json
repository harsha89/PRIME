Thanks again, I am so glad I found this board. It can be a sanity saver. Good luch and a big squeeze(well, maybe not a squeeze,lol) miri",

But I'm sure you have read where 80% of biopsies are b9 (that's in the states tho).  If, after 3 or 4 business days u haven't heard from yours, start asking questions!  I was calling but I see now I should have called radiology and pathology and maybe Obama!!lol Good luck and prayers for you.  Let us know.
