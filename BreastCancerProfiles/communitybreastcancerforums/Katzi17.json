Since discontinuing it my symptoms have gotten worse so I'm inclined to use it again in spite of what the oncologists say. It's a very tricky issue. I don't think it's been proven that progesterone causes any growth. However, I have read of other women using bio identical progesterone who also got breast cancer during that time. I don't know the hormonal status yet but will be seeing my oncologist soon. Please let me know if anyone knows WHY oncologists generally say it isn't good to use it especially with lobular.",
