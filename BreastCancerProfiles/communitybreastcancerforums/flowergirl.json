I then had am implant and recently nipple reconstruction. On my right breast, I have been diagnosed as high risk. I decided to monitor my other side rather than have another masectomy because everything that I have been through has been such a long haul. This past Novemeber, I had an MRI followed by an ultrasound. There was a spot that my surgeon wanted to biopsy and sfter surgery, she said it was probably nothing. It came back as lobular carcinoma, very small, .5 cm. Although she said I could have a lumpectomy followed by radiation, she suggested another masectomy  since I had bc on the other side. She said it was a personal decision and now I am struggling with it. Of course, I want to be healthy, but I don't want to loose my second  breast either. I have never been married and want to meet someone and wanted to get on with my life when this happended. So, I guess, my self-image is involved and also the fact that it will be three mores surgeries; one to have it, then to have the implant and then the nipple. It's such a long process. I don't know if I will ever make the right decision.  Has anyone been in the same situation? Has anyone had another thing pop up after almost two years? I am taking tamaxcofin. I thought that this really works.",
