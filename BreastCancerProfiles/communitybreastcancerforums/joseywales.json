See if there is a Women's Wellness Center in your area. The centers handle all aspects of diagnosis, diagnostic testing, biopsies, surgical referrals, etc... and all of your information is in one place for all to view. I went for a routine mammography exactly 1 year and 1 day from the previous year. This was #25... they came out and said it looked different and they wanted to do a \"diagnostic mammogram\" ... this was about 11AM... at 1PM I had an \"ultrasaound\". By 2PM the head radiologist spoke to me. I was assigned a \"RN Navigator\" to help me through the whole process, set appointments, answer questions, etc... at no charge. I had an appointment at 3PM with the surgeon. This was all done on the same day, Thursday July 9, 2015. A biopsy was scheduled for Monday July 13th. at 10AM. On Tuesday evening the surgeon called me with the results of the biopsy. It was Stage 1 IDC. His office had the Team call me on Wednesday and on the next Tuesday I met with a Social Worker, No Charge - A Genetic doctor, a Radiologist/Oncologist and a Medical Oncologist. Later that same day... the surgeon had ordered an MRI of both breasts. The following week, after the surgeon meets with the team, and discusses the best treatment... by the way, they each examined me separately... in other words... they each have their own assessment and they compare their findings along with the surgeon to find the best treatment. I had an appointment with my internist coincidentally the very next day. He agreed that the tumor should be removed ASAP.The following Tuesday July 21st... met with the surgeon again. He advised me that I needed a lumpectomy and a sentinel lymph node biopsy followed by 33 rounds of radiation for sure. A sample of the tumor is taken during the surgery and sent for the OncoType testing... that result would determine if I needed chemo. as well. On Thursday the 23rd I had a preop at the hospital... on Monday July 27th I was seen at 7AM by the radiologist to implant markers... and then admitted as an out-patient for the surgery. The surgery was at noon... I woke up in the recovery room at about 3:30 and was released about 5PM. So I was diagnosed on July 9th and had the surgery on Monday July 27th... the morning of July 29th by 10AM the surgeon had called. It was my birthday! I got a great present... the lymph nodes were negative. On August 10th I was told by the oncologist that my OncoType Score was 17... that I did not need chemo. The actual cutoff is 18... so I just made it, however they also take into consideration the type of tumor and age. I was Stage 1A, 100% estrogen positive & 90% progesterone positive, HER2 positive. I just turned 64. I started radiology on August 25th... never missed a day... and was done the beginning of October. I started hormonal therapy October 21st... and see the doctors on a planned basis. YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TO WAIT... TAKE MATTERS INTO YOUR OWN HANDS AND FIND THE BEST POSSIBLE WOMEN'S CENTER WHERE EVERYTHING IS COORDINATED IN 1 OR 2 BUILDINGS AND THE DOCTORS WORK TOGETHER AND YOUR MEDIAL RECORDS ARE EASILY ACCESSIBLE TO ALL. I don't know where you live... I hope you an seek out a medical facility nearby. I use the Women's Wellness Center, the Lynn Cancer Institute and Boca Ration Regional Hospital in Boca Raton, Florida. They are highly rated in the top 5 centers in the southeast. I hope this outlines what course you'll be navigating. If you need further info... I'll watch for your message .By the way, just so you do not worry, nothing really was painful... and the surgery recovery was very minimal. Nothing interfered with my daily routine after the first day or two! Good Luck and God Bless. ",
