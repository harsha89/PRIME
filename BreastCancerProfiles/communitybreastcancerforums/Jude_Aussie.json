I wanna keep busy but just seem to be walking round the house in circles, things i gotta do but just can't get it together. I'm trying now to completely detach myself from all this till we have something for sure. Till then, i agree with you..it could just be something \"yucky\" (lol) that will clear up in no time. So good to know someone can say..i know EXACTLY how you feel. Hangin in there and will definitely keep you posted. Thanks for bein there. (Even if it is on the other side of the world!) ",

Cried with relief, couldn't begin to tell you the emotions going through my mind. Felt like i'd been asleep since Monday and somebody has just woken me up. So amazing how differently i view life now-compared to before i went to sleep. A very big heartfelt thank you to this site-albeit for such a short time. I could tangibly feel the support whenever i logged on and it helped so much. For each and every one of you ladies i send my very best wishes and prayers. Would still like to visit this site and see how you are doing. Love and Hugs, Jude.",

It was very itchy, dry and scaly, and weeping. I was totally gobsmacked. I'd never heard of it before, and no history of bc in my family. I went on the internet and just scared the living daylights out of myself some more. I ended up on this site just to talk to someone till i got the results from my core biopsy. The ladies here are all so supportive, always with a kind word and hugs when needed. I sat up all hours of the night due to lack of sleep from worry reading the tons of support from one to another and it helped me immensely. As it turned out, Lori, my result was b9, but without the help of all these lovely ladies, my waiting would've been so much harder. Lori, I hope you too have good news. Thinking you you all the way from Oz.  Jude.",

My doc suspected Paget's Disease when i went to him about a terrible rash and discharge from my nipple last Monday (19th Nov). He ordered a biopsy to be done on Wednesday (21st Nov) and i was so scared. I'd never had a biopsy done before and didn't quite know what to expect. He did give me a local to numb the area and did a core biopsy. Quite uncomfortable, but only took a few minutes. Didn't realise how much it hurt till it was over, so wasn't so bad. The worst part was the waiting, was told maybe Friday (23rd Nov), if not then have to wait till Monday(26th). I couldn't wrap my head around what was happening so i posted my fears on this forum on Thursday (22nd i think!). The understanding and words of encouragement of the people here gave me an inner peace cos  i was not alone. As it turned out, i got my results on the Friday, and was told it was not Paget's Disease. Traci i hope you have a little ray of sunshine too. Best of luck.   Jude.",
