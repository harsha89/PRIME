I am facing a possible bilateral mastectomy and already told my surgeon that I didn't know if I could physically make my hand sign the surgery consent, I may have to give my husband a health care Power of Attorney and let him sign.  I too fear having a complete meltdown and I have read posts from women who did and actually ended up delaying their surgery because of it.  I can't think of any words which will really help you other than I totally get it. I am really sorry you have to go through this.  PM me if you like.",

My post lumpectomy MRI showed some other suspicious areas, but not all the core biopsies I underwent were positive (MRI's do have false positives). With DCIS you do have the options.   My thought process is to continue one more time for the clear margins and even my surgeon said I could still change my mind and have the mastectomies before radiation if that was my decision.  (It's difficult to know how deforming my lumpectomy might be until it's actually performed). If the mastectomy becomes the only option, so be it.  I am planning on interviewing at least a couple of surgeons if mastectomy is necessary.  I am finding there is a lot of variables in how the surgery is performed. Good luck and take care.",

I personally think the fatigue might be partially from interrupted sleep which seems to be a bigger factor for me.  My appointment was 9:30 everyday which is great.  I have friends who had appointments all over the day and had kind of a helter skelter schedule.

Hope you find some answers, but you don't need a psychiatrist (or if you do I need one too!) Take care.",

Take time to research and ask questions.  I sometimes forget when listening to the doctor to not just process the information, but to ask 'why' they are saying certain things.  Really ask what is the basis for the opinion they hold?  If your doc says other anesthesia options are a 'no go', then let's hear the medical reasons.  I know it is really, really hard to go back to your doctor and question them at all about their advice.  No one wants to appear even slightly confrontational, after all this is the physician you are going to let operate on your body, so it sometimes feels like a tightrope act dealing with the doctors. Hope all goes well.  I will be thinking about you.",

So in essence, in some cases where the DCIS is continuous and therefore perhaps a higher grade tumor patients would not have a mastectomy because there condition was not 'multifocal', but where it was considered multifocal (and probably a lower grade case with gaps in the DCIS growth) it was traditional for surgeons to automatically recommend a mastectomy.  This opinion/practice appears to be slowly changing. The most important consideration in treatment of DCIS is probably your margin status.  Then a honest conversation with the surgeon about specifically why a mastectomy would be recommended.  Perhaps the invasive component is the main concern but I personally know many women with Stage I or II BC who had lumpectomy. Here are some links information the article: http://jco.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/abstract/25/35/5591 http://jco.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/full/25/35/5548 http://www.breastcancersource.com/breastcancersourcehcp/6096_29079__.aspx?mid=6 PM if you like.",
