The steri strips say on until they fall off on there own usually around day 10-15 - it's fine for it to get wet but don't soak the area- just pat dry and leave open with steri strips in place . The neck site is usually sealed with dermabond which is a glue which forms a scab and will just peal off on its own like a scab- that is fine to get wet same day.",

I'm waiting to see if the neulesta shot gives me the back pain they warned me about but so far nothing it may still come though- so my advice is make sure you report all your symptoms so that they can help you- as my MO said he wants me to call him anytime and if it is after hours no matter what I am always to tell the operator it's a emergency even if it's not because that's what he is there for.

My red devil is via push as well - interesting how some places have different protocols - it's really toxic so I'm glad they check and triple check as the give the push. My liver functions were out of wack as well prior to infusion so they are rechecking on Friday- I have avoided all OTC meds even emergenC this week- coconut water has been my rehydrate- I only had the plain one for days around chemo - it's not great tasting but after day 2 I've had the flavored ones and they are not bad at all. I'm sorry so many of you are having a difficult time with hubby's- I don't know how you do it- I'm newly divorced and can't imagine having to deal with a hubby as well- I will say I found outy ex is now officially dating some poor woman- my initial thought was how unfair it was that he got to be living it up while I was dealing with this crap- I'm trying not to become the bitter ex wife- but it does suck - still as many of my friends have reminded me karma is a bitch - and I definitely don't want him back so all I can say is good luck to her she is going to need it!! I hope those of you headed to the spa today have an easy ride , and those recovering enjoy our few days of \"normal\".",

I finished AC (2weekly x4) and started taxol weekly- I had #11 today and the plan is for last one on Friday as long as my labs remain consistent and stable. Taxol has been ok - I have managed to work and usually have one day a week where I feel wiped out but otherwise it's been fine. I started glutamine as soon as AC was done and I haven't had to much of an issue with neuropathy. Main issue is insomnia and today I finally got a prescription for ambian. My hair has started to grow but eyebrows are almost all gone and eye lashes as well- of course pits, legs etc growing and now need shaving!!! I had my restaging MRI last week and it showed a complete clinical response so chemo has done its job- yay!!! My BMX is scheduled for Oct 2nd and radiation will depend on final path from that- but honestly being done with chemo is the thing I am most excited about. A friend took me shopping for surgical camisoles and bras yesterday and I learnt that as long as one has a prescription these items are covered by insurance- who knew!!!! Anyway just wanted to pop in and update everyone on my progress. Wishing you all a SE free easy week it's lovely to see you all getting done and kicking cancers ass!!!!",
