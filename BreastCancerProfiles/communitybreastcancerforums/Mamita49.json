I started a book with pictures and writing to them some useful advice on life lessons ex. Don't take for granted what docs are telling you, trust your instinct and always research and get second opinions. I wrote to them about some anecdotes about their childhood, some about mine.

Its not me at all, I have no fear foe me, I came to accept my faith, but its my two girls that I hate to see to suffer. It makes it all soooo much more unbarable to know that my biggest dream EVER is not going to happen. To see my grandchildren. I am keeping myself alive right now ONLY for my two girls ( 24 and 17 years), though I love my hubby, but its not the same than the love and pain you have for your children. We just got a wonderful horse for my younger daughter, and tonight I am going to the stable, like I do 3 times a week. I walk and my body feels strong without any symptoms at all.  Its all in my mind, reading soo many data on the internet that i will be dead in max 4 years, if at all, for sure nor more than that. I need your support for Thursday, just a little bit hope could ease the pain. Thanks Ladies Carol",

Never saw my \" old \" Onc back again. I have been followed by my breast surgeon at McGill for the last 4 years. Now he moved me to the Onc of McGill. First the lesions are on the surface of the liver and small. I am taking since yesterday Femera, and will have a biopsy within the next 2 weeks. The biopsy is to see if the HER-2 status has changed. This happends very often when you have progression. If I am now Her  positive, second line of attack will be Herceptin, If I am still Her-, he will give me the femera plus chemo.  Surgery is not an option, since he believes that you can \" disturb\" the lesions, and cause a major spread. ( This is the only part I am having trouble with, cause I would like to have the 2 spots removed, but he is afraid that, this could cause more desease..??? HHmmm) Its specially the case with breast cancer, not with others cancers, like coloncancer with liver mets, since those other cancers are not related to hormone sensitive cancers. The spread with hormone sensitive cancers are far more possible with surgery.  Well, I will have a second opinion on that one. I told him that I will get a second opinion on that one, about the surgery, and he was very ok, very fine with that. He ordered also a whole body pet scan. My blood test was perfect, tumor markers extremely normal, but the nurse said that this means actually not much. She has seen women with normal tumor markers who had cancer everywhere in their body, and vice versa. So even the markers where like 11..... Whatever that number means, its not saying much. I also have a bit of a fatty liver, but thats not dangerous. He also prescribed me high dose of Vit d and calcium. ( He said its more effective than the zometa for the bones,  .. right now....... and I must keep on with good exercise. Well, thats it, the guy seems to be very smart and calm, very direct and open. My daughter is a scientist herself, in biology, and when the onc mentioned that he will put me on a trial in January, my daughter was very sceptical, since she knows that many doctors do that only to gather as many patiens they can get, to get the amount of people they need from the medical companies. My next appt. is Janyary 10, and by then my daughter will have find out if the \" trial\" is a profit for this doc, which we right now assume NOT, but again......hey..... you never know.

I will still get a second opinion, I have a bit time for this since I started chemo. But know I know that it is possible, possible -- yes indeed-------- 1. have more bad nodes inside of you. Even if the surger. took out many, a lot, and out of 20 nodes taken out, 15 came back positiv, meaning you would think that the others are negativ,  WRONG_____________ How about ALL the other nodes in your body, well------ there is no guarantee, that--- indeed- I have learned........  After my chemo, I will be tested, than I would like to have more surgery, if this is possible-- I will see, but I have the feeling that I will push for this, and I know now that this is possible, than more chemo, than rest time ,than rads on breast and armpit, than hormontherapy.......... Well, thats my plan so far, lets see............., Kerry, how come you dont get the same nurse, my one will always be there working Mond-Friday, and I am next time, on the Wednesday shift, for the rest of my treatment. I am at the Hospital, so its well conected to the University, and has all the facilities close by. Let me know......... ",

But, PLEEEEZZZZEEEE do never forget, some people, some humans need to connect, need to get-out their sad feelings. some others are lucky to have husbands, family/friends, ------------other dont. Their only place is this forum, a distant not personal tool to say whatever you feel like saying.  I am lucky, truly blessed, I have the husband, I have my friend, but I can understand also other women who just need to let-out, let-go of all their garbage to others who are not personally involved with their lives. My advice : Dont take it too personal, just see the arguing or the negative feelings as a vent to let go. But I do hear you and I can feel for your sympathy, that is soooooooooo nice.",

As I gave my speech, a major hot-flash made me look like a wet lady.  One grand-ma came up to me, told me that thank goodness her hot flashes are over since more than 10 years. Ok, whats the point I thought. But then she told me that she had breast cancer 18 years ago, and really bad, had to take 12 x Chemo ( I never heard of that !!!). Anyhow, she never took any hormonals, and never changed her life style, and 18 years out. She made my day, and gave me a big dose of hope for the summer. I wish you all a great summer...........
