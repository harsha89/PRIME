My tumor marker test CA 15-3 came back with a score of 15, with <32 being flagged as high. I know that test isn't 100% reliable- but I am hopeful that it is one more piece of the puzzle... and will help me clarify my decision. Are there any others on here with a similar diagnosis who have opted NOT to do chemo, and are living in remission still? Or once the 3mm tumor shows up in a sentinel node, everyone opts for chemo?? Have a wonderful weekend! Susan",

As long as my insurance allows, I have the name of a female onco who treated a friend's niece. She thought the onco was terrific. If nothing else, I'll let my heart/gut decide. I've always been more comfortable with female drs. I appreciate your input!!",

I think you clarified that. I agree, waiting for the oncotype dx to return will most likely help in clarification. I am pre-menopausal. 48 yrs old. No children. One more clarifying question: If I'm a \"low\" score, under 11?? That means my body will not respond well to chemo. Is that correct? If I do have a low score, then chemo will not provide any benefits?? HER I'm borderline (equivocal?). Perhaps this test will clarify that too?? Thanks again for all your help! Susan",

      "Content": "susancats wrote: Hello- I am a \"Newbie\"- Diagnosed this Aug 2012- Lumpectomy and sentinel nodes removed- 1/2 had 3mm cancer growth (metastatic??) October 11 I met with the Oncologist today. He is ordering an Oncotype DX test for me. I want to be more informed about my decision whether or not to do chemo. I am really leaning toward NOT doing it, as it only provides about 5% more chance of  not reoccurring. I'm still unclear on one test- I understand what this means I am ER/PR + (so I will go on Tamoxifin) but don't know if HER-2/neu 2+   means: negative, neutral or positive 2????... All three are what it says to me! The margins were clear from the 7-9mm lumpectomy, and there was a 3mm metastatic growth (encapsulated) in one of the two lymph nodes. I am very hesitant to do chemo since it is not even a known fact that I still have cancer in my body. To my knowledge and that of the drs, I am cancer free. I don't want to put all those toxic chemicals in my body for something that may not even exist! What are your thoughts? I have a follow-up appointment with  MO on Nov 26 , and the Oncotype DX test takes 14 business days +/- In the mean time I need to have a blood test and a lung xray. I am going to be contacted by the radiation doctors to meet with them about that process. Any insights about oncotyping (what is a good low number vs a higher more threatening number), what does HER-2/neu 2+ mean , or any other info is appreciated.

      "Content": "Oct 27, 2012 11:50PM - edited Oct 27, 2012 11:51PM by susancats Thank you momof3 and voraciousreader. I have been pondering the idea of a second opinion. I felt lukewarm about this onco. He was 25 min late, left 10 min into the interview for 10 min and my husband saw him look at his watch 3 times while I was asking my questions. I suggested the onco type DX test and he dismissed it at first. I think he was trying to save the insurance co. money. The most bothersome comment was: if the breast cancer comes back somewhere else in your body, you won't survive. You will be prolonging your life a little with chemo. That sounded very discouraging. :( I only have a 15% chance of recurrence WITHOUT chemo and a 10% WITH. That's only 5%!! I don't even know if there is any cancer in me! My margins were clear and the cells 3mm in the sentinel node were encapsulated. Doesn't that mean my body was fighting it?? Still confused. Sorry Do you go by \"gut feelings\" in these situations??",

My tumor was located at about 6'oclock under the nipple, so the boosts were aimed there. This is right under the breast and it is where the body/breast meet. It is VERY red. Very sore. Oozing, throbbing, and feels like I'm ripping it when I move. I have silvadene to help with the infection, but I kind of wonder if that's making it worse?? Moist & raw. I tried using a cool hair dryer on it, NO bra all weekend. Advil & aspirin. The rest of my radiation site looks like it's healing- the armpit, just dry & peeling. Any Rads warriors out there have any ideas or suggestions? My Dr did say it might get worse for a couple days (she was right) because of delayed reaction in rads. When should it feel better??? Ugh.
