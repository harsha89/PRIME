Therapy is subject to annual deductibles and co-insurance provisions for physical therapy. Therapy is not subject to visit limitation provisions for physical therapy.\" http://www.aetna.com/cpb/medical/data/1_99/0069.html Maybe you can use this to help you get your PT covered.",

Drug therapy with benzopyrone can also result in slow reduction of lymphedema. This drug is a protoeolytic agent which acts by activating macrophages, which then break down the protein-rich lymphedema fluid, thus decreasing its viscosity and thereby facilitating its flow.

Sorry this is so long, so I created a short version in case you do not have time to read all of this. Short version (skip to the chase) Other than treatment for stage 3 cancer, I have a lot of other physical problems. My job is at risk. LTDI is an option. What should I do? Detailed version (read all about it) Before cancer, I had many chronic health problems. Among these are diabetes, carpal tunnel syndrome, arthritis, bursitis, slipped disc, plantar fasciitis........ Everybody has their annual or semi-annual medical appointments for eyes, dental, pap smear, mammogram, but my other problems resulted in more visits than other folks. Thus, I resolved to try to skip some and spread them out as I did not want to be gone from work so much. I was embarrassed by the volume of medical appointments I needed and felt like my job was at risk. This is why I skipped my pap and mamo one year. I focused on visits that reduced my pain, and then I had to go to diabetes checks, although I cut back on these as well. I skipped my July 2005 mammogram. In May 2006, I found the lump. In June 2006, I was on leave for neoadjuvant chemo and right mastectomy. Then I returned to work and did the radiation while working full time. I was stage 3 with 10 positive nodes. During the rads and for 4 months after, I could hardly stay awake at work and driving to work, but I managed. You do what you have to do. My last visit with the oncologist was good: NED. I continue to work full-time and am starting to get my groove back. It�s just that my groove had some dents and scratches before treatment. Currently I�m getting some PT as I don�t have full motion in my right arm from the surgery and radiation. In September, I�m getting reconstruction. So, I had too many medical appointments and problems before cancer, and now my appointments are at least doubled. My employer expects us to �make-up� time off for appointments. Ha! My job is at risk and I cannot survive without it. If the job goes, my insurance goes as well. I am being pushed to find another position in the company as my department is reducing or changing work force and I am low on the totem pole. Who wants to hire an aging woman that has medical problems? None. Can I face up to the demands and competition of a new position? I don�t think so. I discussed this with my family doctor. His reply was to take care of my health above all other things. He said that I could probably qualify for a disability. Is there anyone else on disability? Any advice? I need some help here��..
