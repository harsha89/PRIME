My hubby stayed home from work the day I came home from the hospital (1-night stay) and went to work the next day. As long as I have food made or something easy to make, I'm fine. I can't walk the dogs (he does when he gets home and I go with them, but can't hold the leashes) but I do let them out to pee twice during the day. My hubby washed my hair in the sink for me this weekend. So basically, I need a little help, but he is able to work. Good luck to you and your wife!",

I saw my oncologist and the plastic surgeon and have decided on bilateral mastectomies with immediate reconstruction using tissue expanders. Today is my MRI (at 5 pm) and I'm scared. I was told that I have one small tumor and nothing in my lymph nodes, but was told that the MRI is to look for anything that was missed. So, is it possible that I'm not stage 1 and that it's spread? I'm also wondering about a connection I read between high copper in blood and cancer. I have had high copper for a few months now. (I get blood tests every 3 months as I had duodenal switch surgery in July 2017). I know most post after the test while they are waiting for results, but I haven't even had the MRI yet and I'm super nervous. Is it possible that I can be much worse on MRI than they knew?

I think one of the most comforting bits of information that I've read on this forum was, \"Don't get ahead of your diagnosis.\" Of course, there is a chance things won't turn out the best possible way, but I've found that since I was diagnosed, I am a warrior. I CAN handle whatever I need to handle and you can too, but no need to go there now. Handle it as it comes. If my diagnosis shortens my lifespan, I honestly believe that my quality of life will be better because of this cancer. This has changed me in a good way. I'm a better person. I cherish my life so much more. And yes, the MRI shows everything and that includes a lot of false positives.Just try and live in the moment (hard I know, but you can do it). Best of luck to you. Please let us know how it goes! xo",

Yesterday, I got the results of my breast MRI and they said there was abnormality in the lymph node on the other side (left), and although not super suspicious, they would like to do a needle biopsy on both sides during my double mastectomy on Monday. The thought of it spreading to my lymph nodes has me very worried and I'm more afraid to get them removed than I am my breasts because of lymphedema. Are there people here who have been through the same experience and have been ok, either with benign results or with removal of lymph nodes and no lymphedema? I just feel like I need some uplifting news. Thank you.
