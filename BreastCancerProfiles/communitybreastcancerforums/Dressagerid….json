She also said to use sun protection any time I am in the sun, especially on the radiated area (but really all over, too.)  I have not been active on this board, more of a lurker than a participant.  I've finished 32 out of 33 treatments, with my final one being tomorrow, April 8th. I start Arrimidex next, probably around the first of May. Ingrid ",
