I know exactly what you mean about the Radiation oncologists not liking to discuss the side effects of radiation. They don't even like to admit that there even are side effects. Mine didn't think I was having them either, but mine were a physical nature not an emotional one. If they admit to one patient, then they have to admit that to all their patients. There are more patients that have side effects then these doctors are aware of. I overheard many conversations in the treatment waiting room.I finished radiation 14 days ago tomorrow. It feels great to have that behind me. Now I waiting for the next phase the hormonal treatment or \"oral\" chemotherapy to start. They are going to put me on Tamoxifen. I am afraid of the Tamoxifen, but unfortunately, I wasn't through menopause yet. I am still coming off the Zoloft that I was taking for my depression. I have come down from 200mgs to 50 as of most recently. My Effexor has been increased up to 100mgs. Tamoxifen and Zoloft don't mix at all otherwise I wouldn't need to change  MarieBernice6234",

Long story somewhat short is that despite the fact I told her that something was wrong and she was slow in giving me the referral for the dermatology. She (RO) stated that it certainly wasn't radiation dermatitis which pissed me off. My anger carried over to today.The RO came by the room where my radiation nurse was discussing this (cue the waterworks) and she responded and didn't like when I told her that I felt like she wasn't listening or hearing me. She said with disbelief in her voice \" What do you mean I don't listen - I always listen to my patients\". She was forced by me to state that she originally didn't agree with me was BECAUSE she hadn't seen radiation dermatitis in that way before. She stated that if I wanted to say it was radiation reaction then she would call it that. It represented to me some arrogance, but back- pedaling all the same. I don't think she will challenge me like that again. Doctors may try to cross me once but never again. The doctors don't have anything if they don't have my cooperation and my body.

I had a similar experience with the rad machine whacking me twice.Now they always manually make sure that there is clearance before they start to run the machine. I think that all the machines have the ability to be manually controlled. I don't have any knowledge about the lungs getting some of the radiation, but maybe someone here does. Don't look at the bigger picture of the number of days. Just take it one day at a time. Maybe find some way to reward yourself at the end of the treatment week.

In any event, my medical facility has a strong patient advocacy program so I am going to bring it in front of them. Can't let it rest at this level. End of my rant. MarieBernice6234",

I apologize that I don't know enough yet to post all the finer details of my particular situation just yet All I do know is its size(less than half centimeter and that it is invasive with a combination of cells. ERS positive and the results of the HERS test hasn't come back yet. I don't even know how important the HERS test is.    I am going to meet with a general surgeon who works closely with the breast care center team. She is young, actually almost 16 years my junior and has only been out of medical school for 9 years! She had a fellowship  most recently at the Sloan Kettering Cancer Institue in NY.    I don't know if 9 years experience is enough. I thought it would be some type of breast surgeon and not a general one. What is a medical oncologist how is that different from the radiation oncologist or even my own primary care physician? Also do you know what Amarose Inhibiting medication.  What are the differences and similarity? Sorry for all the questions  MarieBernice6234",

You are right, there is a lot of information coming at me from all sides.  And more tomorrow, of course. You said that yours is invasive ductal cancer, I gather that there is a difference between the two diagnoses. My facility very strongly uses a team approach.and everyone has a nurse \"navigator\" like a \"go to person\" who walks through the whole process with you, They have a very close and intimate relationship.  It was actually upon her recommendation that I explored this site by name.  From what I understand, tomorrow will be both a follow up visit from my biopsy and a more personal explanation of my results. Along with this, it will be used as a pre-planning stage for what lies ahead.   I know that my situation is not that advanced that they will want to jump on it immediately, but it has broken through and away from the original cells so they will want to not have too much time pass before the lumpectomy. It is fairly certain at this point that some form of oral chemotherapy will be needed. Followed by a more conventional course of radiation.  My facility tends to use this type of three pronged approach. What is the difference between STAGE and GRADE- does grade address the aggressiveness of the cancer cells? The practitioner says it is a less aggressive form - does that give it a low grade number?",

I do have some calcifications noted on previous exams. Two or three days I had a call asking me to come back for more pictures. That had happened before so I didn't think much of it. My medical center uses 3D mammo machines as a routine practice. Then it escalated to magnification views. And as prepared they said that they were going to do breast ultrasounds. 2 of them. They still weren't thrilled at what they were looking at - it was a change since the last one. This necessitated a core needle biopsy which was done 4 days ago. . On Friday, the results came back as Invasive Breast cancer Stage 1. The area is very small a half of a centimeter, made up of some undifferentiated cells.My medical center has a three pronged approach, surgery, chemo (oral for me) and then radiation, probably 6 week course. There are some calcifications nearby this growth also so those are coming out as well. It is a mixed report -small, caught early on, invasive, but with a good prognosis.    Unfortunately, these events just happened following a 4 month period of time recovering from 2 broken ankles.  I had returned to doing home visits as part of my job, for about just a month until this started to unfold. They are going to be able to use some of the estrogen based medications as there are receptors there for that. Something called the HERS result has not come back - maybe on Friday.It is somewhat overwhelming at this time.  MarieBernice6234",

Despite my original trepidations etc about someone who was 16 years than me That proved to be unfounded - she is wonderful. In the last year alone, she had done between 600 - 700 breast surgeries of all types, while on a Fellowship at Sloan Kettering Cancer Institute.  That is almost double the amount of breast surgeries that her counterparts  at my medical center. Between the nurse practitioner and the surgeon, all my questions were answered. The surgeon stated that normally 1-3 lymph nodes are removed during the procedure. They are going to take out the collection of calcifications closest to the mass.  She doesn't expect that the HERS test will come out positive. She still thinks that when all is said and done, it will be a stage 1, grade one, not very aggressive. They are going to send a sample of tissue out for the Oncotype diagnosis test,  to see what  the likelihood of this type of cancer recurring. Again based on size, etc, she doesn't see this as being a real concern.   My surgery has already been scheduled for the 30th of this month, so the wheels are in motion.   If everything goes pretty much according to the rough schedule, I should have the surgery and radiation done by early December. Then I will be starting the estrogen blockers. Merry Christmas to me huh.     I am still trying to take it one step at a time. Trying to form a really good support team outside of this board. Although I am a Social Worker by profession, this time I am going to hand it over to the Social Workers attached to the team. I am not going to have the energy to take on insurance issues etc on my own behalf. This time I will let someone else do that. Besides when I do return to work after the surgery, I have to save that energy for my own patients, which doesn't have the emotional charge to it.                                   MarieBernice6234                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ",

Then of, course unless we are walking around with our arms up in the air, the inner aspect of our arms are going to be in contact with the source of \"heat.\" In that way, a prickly heat type of rash can develop. It makes perfect sense to me when you break it down. The proof is in the pudding because ever since I started the cream the dermatologist recommended, the rash is all but gone. MarieBernice6234",
