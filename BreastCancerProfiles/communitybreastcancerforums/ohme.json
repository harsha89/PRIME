I found a tiny ballbearing size (kind of round-ish) lump on the edge of my right areola about two weeks ago and have since developed a patch of dry skin on top of it. It feels quite hard and once when I squeezed it really hard a small amount of clear liquid and blood came out but nothing since. Does this sound like anything to worry about or has anyone got any advice?   Thanks in advance! Log in to post a reply",
