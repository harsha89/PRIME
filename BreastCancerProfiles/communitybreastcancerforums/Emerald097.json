I have two blood relatives that live here, but they both work. I'm just usually doing everything myself. I love my family, but we don't have the best relationship. I do have an aunt that I'm very close with but she doesn't live here. The family that I have living here, I just can't really talk to them like I would like to.",

The doctor numbed it, double numbed it because I was concerned becase I know he had to go deep in there to get to it. I felt that one, I pretty much screamed, it was so painful. That site has a hematoma and the nurse told me that it would probably be sore until next week. I'm just in a lot of pain. I can't lift anything over 5 pounds for the next 2 days. So my daughter is home helping me and the school is being understanding of that. I feel bad that I can't hold my baby. Thank you all so much for being there for me. It helps a lot. *big hugs*",

There really are no words to express the pain that I felt for him and the pain that I still feel for him because it's something that he will have to deal with the rest of his life. As for me, I'm very scared right now and I have been down playing how I really feel with my family. I've had lumps removed from my right breast before and they were both benign tumors, but this was back in 1997 and I was much younger then. I am 36 and a single mom to three children. My youngest child is 9 months old. I now have two lumps in my left breast. I have a mass that I found for the first time when my baby was 2 months old at my postpartum check up. The doctor just figured it was nothing and said we will just watch it. The lump has gotten bigger since then. I had my first mammogram this monday. They also did ultrasound as well. I was there for about 2 hours because the doc wanted more and different angles on the mammo. The doc sent me to do the mammogram like 3 times. After the third time the technician was like you can stop after this one. The tech felt like I had been through a lot that day. The doctor also found another spot, but she said she would just watch it and do another mammo in 6 months. As far as the large mass she wants a biopsy right away and she also wants to biopsy my lymph node under my arm on the left side, the same side where the mass is. I've never had a lymph node biopsied before. The nurse that has been helping me with resources to get the testing done because I don't have insurance, told me that the doc wants to do this because she suspects that it is cancer. I just want to know if doctors really know if a mass is cancer on the mammo. I know that my sons case is different, but with him they did an ultrasound on his abdomen and the the doc came in the room and has this look on his face and he said that they think that he has a germ cell tumor but they need to do a biopsy  on it, but they were 85% sure that it was going to come back cancerous before they even did the biopsy.

I do believe in God and I know that he has done so much for me and continues to do a lot for me. She just loves to let me know that God allows things to happen to bring you back to him. I have not left God and to me that's not what church is about. I just feel that life is going to happen whether you go to church everyday or not at all. It's just really frustrating to have that type of negativity around me. Especially when things are so stressful. Her logic does not even make since. If things really worked like that, then she would never ever be sick or have a problem in the world. So sadly, I'm not going to be able to rely on her for much. Who would want someone like that around them when they are going through things?",

I had a core needle biopsy of the lump and they also biopsied the axillary lymph node the same way. The doc was only able to get 2 samples because I was in too much pain, he wanted to get a third sample, but he decided not to because I was hurting too bad. Knowing what I know now, they should never biopsy the axillary unless your sedated because they have to go to deep and the numbing meds don't go that far for that one. ",

I was able to get an appointment with my regular doctor tomorrow, but I'm thinking that I should call my surgeon in the morning to let him know. I really don't want to leave their office tomorrow without an ultrasound. I do have an appointment with my hematologist who is also an oncologist to discuss a treatment plan for my ADH.
