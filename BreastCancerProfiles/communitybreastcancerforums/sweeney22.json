It's called Quell Users Group it's a small group now but it might me worth joining. I did just to share experience from a post cancer treatment pain point of view. I use a tens machine now but am in bed much of the time I have typical Pmps pain and atypical. I'm almost three yrs out of treatment and have had pain for most of that time and I tried to live w it but now it's worsening and I'm trying to find help and answers which is very hard I have no quality of life so I'm praying something gives. Quell won't work for everyone so I'm hoping it might work for me there is a good return policy though.",

That took care of part of my pain. I\u2019ve had another nerve surgery since to help an area where I have rad damage and that helped a lot but still had pain so I just had fat grafting for adherent scar and to hopefully help rad tissue with the stem cells from my fat. I have some improvement but still have pain. I\u2019m told it takes time so we will see. I hadn\u2019t lipo on my abdomen as the donor site and man that hurt and four weeks out still hurts at times! I\u2019m approved for medical MJ and I may need another grafting. I\u2019m trying to get as mich relief as possible. It\u2019s been a hard four uesrs",

Lymphedema -is mild and not causing my issues which is tingling burning across chest with certain movements. This sensation causes me to cough terribly and I feel flu like when it happens. I had pain sincer surgery and rad in fall 2013. In March 2014 I was shoveling heavy snow and I felt pain in my chest and armpit but kept going next day is when the tingling burning began and I went on journey of doctors sending me to other docs and tLE specialist then my shoulder froze and symptoms were less. They happened less often so I could live w them. Then my shoulder began to unfreeze and since last May this year I've been in pain all on my right side. Sever armpit pain and rib pain and that tingling burning in chest was awful. I have been searching for help ever since. My BS was no help and I finally found a physiatrist to help me and a pain mgmt doc. I found them on my own. I had an mRI of brachial plexus and that was normal but physiatrist called me and mentioned surgical clips and how they are right near my pain and that he read cases where woman got them removed and had symptoms go away. He suggested I see my bs. But I feel she's blown me off w any complaints. So now I am trying to research this issue and see how I can get my BS to listen to my thoughts on this. I am also seeing a plastic surgeon to see if he'd take them out. I'm miserable and am in terrible pain. I just got a device called quell that has helped with the burning and such but bc the pain is less I can pinpoint exactly the areas of pain I have and it's all where clips are. I'm have a CT scan be the one wants to rule out mets. They don't think it is bc mri I just had showed nothing in the area of pain. Plus CT will show clips too. I'm super sensitive to things and I can't believe I didn't think about clips until doc called I'm sure he didn't want to make waves w BS - but he is dir of cancer rehab at natl rehab hospital so he's pretty smart. So here I am will see",
