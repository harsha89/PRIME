Within the past three days I have had severe right breast pain, major swelling, my breast became hard and half my breast has turned bright red. Went to the doctor and she ordered a mammogram and an ultrasound which I did today. It came back with two cysts 7 and 15 mm with debris in both. She said my wbc was slightly elevated and put me on an antibiotic. The redness is still spreading. She doesn't think I have IBC but is concerned about the way my breast looks. Both ladies today at the screening office said they haven't seen anything like this. I'm 38. Ugh. Thoughts? Thank you, April Log in to post a reply",
