I can't take pain meds -- they make me crazy sick, so I'm just planning on taking it very easy and letting others help out with the kids and stuff.  hope you enjoyed your shower!  lol -- having had other surgeries where you can't have a shower for a while, I know how that goes! crossing my fingers for good results for you, m.",
