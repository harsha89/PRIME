( So weird but the beautiful Asian gal I met today, told me not to eat \"red meat\" to make your scar go away!   I tried not to laugh..it sounded so wierd)    I have several areas still \"open\" on my scars...sigh  The hospital I went to used \"glue\" instead of dressings which was really nice! The drain story was something!  Things do work out in the end!  I remember when they pulled my drains, the site did drain alot for the first few hours, and I mean a lot!  Here's to NEVER having those ever again!   I heard that the \"puffiness\" but more like \"dogears\" for me will get fixed at my revision surgery.

I was also going to add that I am starting to do Advil PM which is really good to sleep.  I have had the DIEP and my last drain came out Thursday. I honestly think I felt better, and moved more last week with the drain and will be four weeks tomorrow. Perhaps it is the heat that is killing me...I will use the threadmill instead of going out in the 100 degree weather. Happy healing everyone! Our pool is even too HOT to go in!",

If you have pain, which is a SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE, you have pain.   I switched to vicodin one week ago and then this week, when I ran out yesterday, I went 24hrs without and even took Advil pm to sleep but only got 3 hrs of sleep!  So in the morning (yesterday) I too called and asked for another week, and they reminded me on the phone that it is a narcotic which I said I am well aware of and they ordered it without any problem.  For me, I am so grateful that the PA said that it is normal to have the pain I am having and it does make sense to DO LESS if you are hurting!  I am getting bored of this and am a person who likes to move.   Self Image?  I am amazed at how good I feel now that my belly roll is gone!!!!  More later on that ...I am very happy to wake up with soft \"girls\" and it turned out to be so much less friengthening than I thought the 11surgery was going to be!  I am grateful to my medical team, and feel like I just had cosmetic surgery, forgetting sometimes that it was for a BC! speech529  That is great that you got a cleaning person to help!

Lidocaine patches, and meds like tramadol prn.  Estrogen depleted quickly sucks via instapause, but is important to not feed my previous er positive breast cancer with replacing it. Time will tell with serial bone scans how it goes.  I need prayers to deal with this new pain, lack of sleep...but thank God I have been told it is not mets....even though a MRI said that it was a possibility.   Thanks ladies for sharing your stories as it helps.",

I can imagine that the more you have removed the more pain there would be .   It seems like the SNB pain is the worse and most long term but DOES get better from what i read.  There are so many resources here and threads with specific advice.   Best of luck to you and you are in my thoughts.

      "Content": "Jun 6, 2011 09:03PM - edited Jun 6, 2011 09:14PM by MRDRN Hi Kasi, I am sorry to hear your news.  I was exactly where you are in April 2010, Radiologist told me that she saw what looked like BC and rolled the ultrasound over and did not see any nodes.....good sign!  I remember feeling devastated and literally took this web site and read for as much as I could!  Then I talked to three different BC surgeons.   I was told to get a lumpectomy but Hopkins had a \"Plastic Surgery Class\" that honestly I cried through and could learn of all PS procedures.  Some ladies where there that lost their implants for one reason or another!  I did learn that there were many choices and decided to take my time to decide which option to choose and read BreastCancer.org a lot. ...lump vs mx, with rads or without,  and (I knew I had the BC gene so this may be different for you) and made things a bit easier to go with an immediate DIEP bilaterally.   I spent the weekend with a lady who was happy with her choice of lumpectomy and is starting rads this week.  EVERYONE has their own journey. The important thing is to talk to different Docs and different patients and learn what you can handle to make an informed choice.    The decision for PS is overwhelming and there are SOO MANY resources here at BreastCancer.org.   Waiting for the grade and talking to more than one surgeon is helpful.   Waiting too long is not the best either....six weeks after biopsy to surgery is what I remember was told to me.  I wish you all the best but know that MANY MANY ladies hear these words and do fine!  I had been told my cancer was both ILC and IDC, but less than a cm so that was good. The articles are good here too, and whatever you do, take your time, ask questions, and know that they know more today than ever before on what to do!   Best of luck and keep us posted.   One day at a time, and in time, you will be through the worse part.....now I am celebrating one year post surgery this week!   You will be saying the same thing before you know it!  Best of luck.   ((((HUGs))))))",
