I hope it's ok for me to pass her your way....I think she really could use the support. I am fighting right here with all of you and sending you my prayers and thoughts!!!! I believe in each and every one of you! Rock on, girl power!!!! :-) LOVE LOVE LOVE, Steph",

I am just trying to soak everything in and learn as much as I can from all of you amazing women. You are all SUCH a HUGE inspiration to me- and I am begging my mom to join the site. I know she will love you all. Also, Shirlann...we have spoken a bit and I would also like to say that your daughter in law is insane! Haha- you are incredible and you are just all over the place on this site with your timeless words of wisdom. I am terrified, but you all make me feel so much better and so not alone. I can't wait for Mama to meet you all. Many thanks for your courage and love- my thoughts are CONSTANTLY with you all! Tears of happiness and hope are flowing. TONS of love, Stephanie",
