I am starting Kadcyla tomorrow morning and am ready to kick this - I had been \"clean\" for 2.5 years but the Tumor on my femur flared up and I have positive pelvic lymph nodes (confirmed by biopsy). I have been on Herceptin since March 2012. We did TCH for 4 months at that time and my liver met disappeared... I had a brain met found in 2014 (after a seizure) that we removed & radiated. I am happy there is TDM-1 ready for me now bit not excited to know I am on this forever or until disease progression (I hate that term). I asked my doc if we can revert back to Herceptin and maybe add Perjeta (never had that one) after my scans are clean again - he said it was not approved that way but that things may change... Wish me luck! I just turned 42. I have 2 kids: Sam (9) and Eva (7). I live in Chicago. Sending warm hugs to all of you! ",
