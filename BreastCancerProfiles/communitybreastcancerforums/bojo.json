The adjacent tissue showed fibrocystic changes with epithelial hyperplasia, rare/minute microcalcifications and milk-of-calcium and a 0.3 cm focus of fibroadenoma (not cancer)  2nd location calcifications biopsied right breast is ductal carcinoma in situ, solid type, high-grade with necrosis and calcifications.  (cancer)  3rd location atypical ductal hyperplasia with microcalcifications (not cancer yet, but needs to come out) So my question is do I get a mastectomy?  Do I have a choice?  Can you have 2 lumpectomies in two different area's of the breast?  My appointment with my surgeon is on the 19th, but thought i would ask in this forum Dx 5/2005, DCIS, Stage 0, Grade 3, ER+/PR+, HER2- Dx 10/7/2011, IDC, <1cm, Stage I, Grade 3, 0/2 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
