Got a mammogram T series test( Sorry forgot the name of it)  They asked me to return in the afternoon for a sonogram. I spoke with the doctor and I have cancer, the doctor wanted to me see the surgeon yesterday if that was possible. They were able to get me an appt with a surgeon they highly recommend, and I knew of her through through friends. She was off Monday and couldn't see me till next week Weds. The office manager actually texted her at her home to get me in for Tues, and they blocked out the  afternoon on Tues to do the biopsy's  The doctor told me that the lump was cancer, and that there appeared to be other involvements in the breast.  My mental state at the moment is strange, I just feel numb, flat.  I know its bad, but at this point don't how bad. I have no family history of breast cancer, or any cancer on both sides of my family.. However, as soon as I felt that lump I knew.  Finding this board has been very helpful, I know little about breast cancer except the awful side effects of chemo. Log in to post a reply",
