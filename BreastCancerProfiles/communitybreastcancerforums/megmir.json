Can anyone tell me if I'm right on this? I have to see Dr. on Tuesday morning but got this on my own from hospital now because didn't want to wait until then. Thank you for any insight yall can give me on all of these words.",

Found calcifications and went in for higher resolution mammo and in my report it reads large grouping of fine pleomorphic calcifications at the 12 o clock position and scheduled me for a stereotactic biopsy this Tuesday morning. I am a Birad 4 suspicious. I know it can be just due to tissue changes but I am frightened. Paternal grandmother had breast cancer in her 60's or 70's and had radiation. Not sure what kind she had so there is a family history of BC but only her that I know of. Maternal GM died of ovarian n cervical cancer at 60. The worry is they are fine, grouped and pleomorphic. Is it still a good chance it's just tissue changes? Log in to post a reply",

They took 10 samples out. Is that normal to take so many? Thought it would only be 3 or so. Supposed to hear results today or tomorrow. The waiting is driving me crazy. Keep looking at my phone.",
