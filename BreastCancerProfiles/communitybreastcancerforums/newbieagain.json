Almost all my sisters are online. 6 1/2 yrs ago I was dx'd with tubular carcinoma, stage 1, no nodes. No chemo, no rads, but I did chose to have a bilateral mast. Tamoxifen for 3 years, I quit after that, it made my life miserable.  A couple of weeks ago I noticed rib pain...severe. I was down and out for a few days. Onc ordered a bone scan and PET. Both tests showed \"trauma\" in the 5th rib, same as cancer side. As far as I know there had been no trauma, wouldn't I have felt that? They can't rule out mets. Now my onc wants me to wait 1-2 months for a repeat bone scan. I would like some input here. I have 2 young teenagers who kinda need me right now, and I am not willing to play roulette with my health. Has anyone here had a similar experience? Hugs to all, Pam Log in to post a reply",

I guess if you have gone through all the hot flashes, and the other fun already you might as well be, right? Hope you will celebrate :) Pam",

I will turn 50 in a couple of months, and wonder if this has something to do with being forced into early menopause with tamoxifen. My bones aren't what they used to be. Stay with the doctors, don't let up, they don't know it all. Pam",

It would certainly explain why my kids think I have early alzheimers. Seriously, I can't remember anything! Do you know the other day I forgot to turn the car off???? How do you forget that?? Fortunately, my husband was home and found it running in the garage before we croaked. I think that scared us both a little. Before that it was something we joked about, not anymore. Pam",
