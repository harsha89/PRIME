I had a bilateral mastectomy 5 years ago for high grade DCIS. I was in a lot of pain for about two weeks. After that, I noticed I had very bad burning pain under my left arm and across my chest. I attempted to just deal with it for 6 months until I couldn't deal with it anymore. I went to my doctor who diagnosed me with fibromyalgia which I didn't believe I had. So, I went to a pain doctor and he diagnosed me with post mastectomy pain syndrome and said my intercostal brachial nerve was damaged. We tried many nerve blocks that did not work and I was finally put on a high dose of Neurontin. Neurontin does work well, but it is cause me to have short term memory loss. However, when I try to reduce the dose I am in severe pain. Does anyone no of anyone who specializes in PMPS in the Chicagoland area? I am kind of at a loss.",

The only doctor that I have read about that does is in Australia for pete's sake. If this is so common, why aren't there any doctors who specialize in it in the United States. It is ridiculous.",
