It was only a $1 but it's a win so I'm not complaining.  The rad techs were great and put dots on the area being radiated, so I can make sure that the area has lots of sunscreen on it and is covered well. I do have a long sleeve SPF50 shirt that I got years ago from Travelsmith to wear when I went to Egypt. I'll have to dig it out and take it with just in case. I will also make sure I get under a tree for awhile. Ironically, the roped off beer garden has plenty of shade.  Oops, guess I shouldn't have any of that either - well, maybe I can enjoy one cold one.  Otherwise, it will be lots of water for me - I'm not a pop drinker. I did notice a little tightness today when I had to put my arm overhead in the cradle, so I will be lathering on the aloe vera and Aquaphor and working on arm exercises. Everyone, have a great weekend and Fourth of July.",

This year there are two headliners - CeLo Green and Ben Harper.  I missed last year's 20th anniversary concert with Santana because I was in MN taking care of my Mom and sister who both had surgery the same week, so I was really looking forward to this year.  If I have to wear long pants and long sleeves, I will die (90 degrees plus hot flasheswon't help).",

Is it too late for me to join the June 2011 group or should I be joining the July group?  I start my rads tomorrow, June 27.  I've lurked around some of the previous months to get an idea of what to expect - not exactly looking forward to it, but hey, at least I didn't have to have chemo. I got my tattoos last Tuesday, same day that I was started on Arimidex.  Already into the hot flashes and night sweats, but I am keeping positive that this will be the worst of any SEs. I also bought my lotions and stole someone else's idea of buying 33 scratch tickets.  I hope to win big by the end of this.",

Guess they wanted to have an early Friday off.  It was good to get it over with for the day, but it messed up my new habit of trying to go for a daily walk in the morning.  The afternoons are too hot and muggy and there is a free concert downtown tonight, girls road trip to Sioux Falls to a big scrapbooking store tomorrow - so much for the new habit I was going to start. Have a good weekend.",

My right nipple is much darker and a little bigger than the left, but other that no pain or soreness that I can complain of.  I guess I'm one of the lucky ones so far as the radiation goes.  On the other hand, I started on Anastrozole  (Arimidex) the week before I started rads and am having to deal with hot flashes and night sweats which has been especially bad during this unseasonably hot weather.  I carry a little portable fan with me at all times and I'm not shy about taking it out in public and using it!  I also started to get a little stiff in the joints, but am trying to walk and exercise more.  I can really tell that on the days I am more active, I am less tired and less stiff. ",

He offered to give me Effexor just like my PCP did, but I'm hoping that if I give it another month or two, they will lessen.  Once the radiation is over and I can get serious about losing some weight and exercise more, hopefully that will take care of the SE's.  Looking forward to moving on to the After Rads thread.",
