I was put on a liquid diet for Saturday and the prep fluids beginning Sunday noon. Then water for the rest of the day. Procedure was early Monday morning. Relax it is not so bad.",

I am doing fairly well for day 7 after surgery.  My appointments for followup are Wednesday with PS and Thursday with BS.  Hoping for final pathology reports at that time.  Both drains are down to about 10cc every 24 hrs so anticipate having them removed.  Then if no radiation is required can start planning DEIP reconsruction plans.  An end is in sight.

My port was placed in my chest and the surgeon made sure it was to the side of my normal bra strap for comfort. It was visible with wide neck lines but was able to cover it with most v-necks. The incision is barely visible 6 weeks out from removal. I could feel the tube, it went upwards and then turned downward toward the heart but I don't think it will be visible. I would definitely do the port again. I did not have the metal taste as the needle was removed, but do agree I had a metal taste sometimes during the infusion. I had TAC chemo. I chewed shaved ice during my treatments and rinsed my mouth several times a day with both the magic mouthwash and the baking soda mixture. I did avoid mouth sores but had thrush and a very tender and sometimes raw tongue. I would totally lose taste of most foods for several days during the first few treatments and for a week or more in the later treatments. I did not ice my fingers or toes. I do still have some minor neuropathy in my fingers and toes up to the first joint. I am finally starting to feel some improvement. It has not prevented me from doing anything I want to do. I am 3 months out from last infusion. A good thing is my hair is very thick and about a half inch long now. When things start returning to normal it is easier to say chemo is doable. I kept a smile on my face throughout the whole process and it made it better even with the side effects. They do pass and you will feel better quicker than you think at the time. Good luck to all starting this adventure. My prayers will be with you. I will be starting rads in the next week or so my mapping has been done. Hope everyone has a great week as they pursue each step of this journey. Hugs to all.",

Got to take my first full shower and it was heavenly.  Lisa -  so much can happen in one week.  Sure hoping you can get those drains out soon.  I was surprised mine were ready to pull after having been infected.  I was draining slow but steady at least I knew they were not stopping up this time.  I definitely know you are going crazy with them in this long.  Smaller more frequent fills sound more manageable.  Sorry to also hear of possible chemo.  I made it through the chemo with minimal SE\u2019s but I was not coming off surgery rehab.  I do have lots of faith in chemo after enduring the process.  I will pray your \u201ccocktail\u201d will produce few SE\u2019s and eat any remaining loose cancer cells in the process.  Glad going back to work gives you a little bit of normal back in your life. JennH \u2013 so glad you got to return to work as well.  Hope your visit with your BS was good.  Hope the swelling on the sides was just swelling and not a building up of fluids.  KBeee \u2013 your life never slows down.  Sorry about the disappointment of not being able to attend/work the football game.  That is like losing a best friend.  I spent so many years supporting one group or another at football games.  My children seemed to be involved in everything and I wanted to be there to support them.  Hope the next several months speed on by.  I have been at this since treatment started in February.  I am hoping to be through by this February.  I didn\u2019t ask many questions at the beginning but am asking lots of questions regarding reconstruction.  You will have to live with the results for the rest of your life. You need to post your salsa recipe for us.  Hopefully you got your wigs, have fun at your hair shaving party.  I had both of my daughters go with me to have my head buzzed, wig cut and shaped.  We took videos and then met all the men afterwards for a nice dinner.  Make the best of it.  Aviva \u2013 good luck with your onco appointment. Did the underarm bulk ever go down?  I have the same issue and when on my side I feel like the 2 expanders are touching in the middle.  If I lift my arms and reposition them I seem to get release also.  I understand what you are feeling.  My BS is also sending me to a PT for LE she said it is so I can learn what exercises to do to help return to full range of motion and to prevent fluid build up even though I only had 2 SND\u2019s removed.  It should only take 2 visits.  Ndgrrl \u2013 hope the rads went well. Babs \u2013 sounds like you are moving along as scheduled.  Glad you made it through your meeting ok.  I had my power port removed during the mx also.  I never had any problems with mine being in my chest.  I only used it to receive chemo, I used my arms for all blood draws but I could use both arms prior to surgery.  Now I guess I only have one arm for blood draws. Wrenn \u2013 I hope the fluid slows down and you can get the drains removed.  I had mostly yellow by the time they removed mine but I had an infection at day 10 and the PS opened me back up and cleaned me up.  I got them out 7 days later.  For everyone waiting for oncology visits and decisions my prayers are with you as you have to make these tough choices. For anyone I did not specifically address I do care about your progress and hope everyone peace.",

Glad I did chemo first to did give me several months to talk with both BS and PS and prepare for surgery and reconstruction. Originally I was going to do reconstruction day of mastectomy. Then the BS and PS decided since my tumor was originally against the chest wall we should do delayed recon (DIEP) in case we did not get clear margins. Good decision DCIS was found in the tumor bed and did not get a good enough margin so rads were needed. Too much risk in flap failure with radiation. PS is hoping tissue is good enough for surgery in the next 4 or 5 months. Good luck with your fills and I assume Implants in the future?",

Aviva - so sorry you have to have additional surgery.  We will be in your pockets on Friday.  Praying for an easy recovery. Rosamond, Honeybair and GrammaB - wishing good continued recovery, you give the rest of us hope. DMarie24, JennH8 and KBeee - thinking of you as we prepare for surgery next week.  I know the closer it gets to Monday the more nervous I am getting.  Trying to make sure I am totally prepared at home.  Luckily I do not have any kids still at home.  I only have a great supportive husband to worry about.  No real worry he has been great and will do great through this. On my way to church prayer meeting, will lift everyone up to God tonight.",

I did have any nodes checked before my neo-adjuvant chemo. The SNB at time of surgery came back clear during surgery and the micro reports did show an area that could have been active but had a complete response with the chemo. KBeee I am glad # 2 went so well. I kept up with everything chemo related from each treatment including my blood test results, how much water I consumed, if I needed any additional meds, etc. to compare as well as weight, blood pressure and heart rate. I was lucky that each treatment was very similar in tests. I also logged when I felt the weakest and when I what I was able to eat. The only thing that seemed cumulative was each treatment I had longer tongue and taste bud issues. You can make a game of it with the goal to be just a little better or at least as good as that first treatment. It is also good if you need to take it to a MO appointment if things are progressing worse than you wanted. Wrenn still praying for you to heal nicely over the next couple weeks and get your treatments back on schedule. I am moving along I have done 3 of 25 rads and so far so good.

Yesterday I had an appointment with an RO to discuss possibility of rads.  One margin was apparently not clear and is against the chest wall and cannot be reoperated.  So 5 weeks of rads to start first week of October.  My chemo killed the tumor and I only had 5mm of the 3cm tumor left, but DCIS was found in the tumor bed.  Two areas of DCIS were found in the prop breast.  Glad I did not choose the lumpectomy.  My new diagnosis is ypT1a, pN0, mx.  So great final diagnosis. What I am most disappointed about is now instead of going for DIEP in November I will now have to wait for probably 9 months to pursue recon.  I guess that will mean living with these TE's for a long time.  The RO does not want them filled any more than they already are.  Onward we march. Lili - I am praying so hard for the drainage to continue its downward output and you can safely have those drains removed.  It's your turn to march onward. Wrenn - I don't know about your red drainage but both of mine the final 3 days were a yellowish/clear discharge.  I only had red drainage for a few hours following surgery.  Hang in there your BS I am sure is watching you. Babs - you sound great.  Keep gaining more strength.  To those starting chemo, keep a positive attitude, drink water, drink water, drink water.  If no one has told you drink water  Hopefully everyones blood counts come into line.  I had my chemo before surgery so I was very healthy when I started, so I cannot speak about handling chemo after the body has already been worn down.  But your MO will watch you closely and will not treat if you are not healthy enough to handle it.  Praying for very few side effects.  My hardest days were days 3-5 after treatments.  I felt good on day after.  So I chose Tuesdays for treatment and could rest all I wanted on Thurdsay  - Saturday.  Just thought I would throw out that tidbit.  Never had any nausea.  They have lots of meds to prevent that. Take them even if you don't feel like you need them.  Good luck and the chemo threads are really supportive I couldn't have made it through those first 4 months without them.  Hope everyone is having a great weekend.  I am cleaning out the camper we are going to the beach next weekend for a surfer reunion of friends from the 60's and 70's.  This will be the third year to do this.  Need this so bad.",

My best tips for A/C is drink water, drink water and when you feel you are floating drink more water.  I also found eating 6 small meals was better for me.  I did get the thrush each time.  It was nasty.  I used a miracle mouthwash my onc staff suggested.  1 part Maalox, 1 part liquid advil, 1 part liquid benedryll, and 10 drops lidocaine.  It was a wonderful soother.  This is different from mouth sores, that I did not have a problem with, I did suck on ice chips throughout my drip of Adriamycin and Taxotere.  I did and do still have some minor neuopathy in the finger tips and toes and did lose both of my big toe nails but they are growing back in and looking great now.  I did not ice my toes or fingers, good luck to those who choose to.  Some ladies from my group used bags of frozen peas.  Some had luck and some didn't.  I did have a bad case of bone pain wth my first Neulasta shot so the onc had me start taking the Claritin 2 days before chemo and 7 days after and it worked like a charm.  The Neulasta did wonders on my blood counts, never even pushed a bad level in any blood test.  I know you get tired of hearing chemo is doable but there is no better word to describe it.  Not fun but not as bad as I dreamed it would be.  Lots of walking even when you do not feel like it.  I know it may be harder for some of you because you have already been knocked down with surgery.  I was very healthy going into chemo since that was my first treatment. Welcome to the ladies joining recently.  I will read and get updated on everyone.  I plan to remain here on this group and will join the fall rads group and lurk on the chemo boards for Sept. and Oct. to see how things are progressing with each of you.   ",

I don't know what it would have done to my spirits with this kind of set back. That being said, please take care and get as refreshed as you can before starting. We are all pulling for you. KBeee your thoughts about not worrying about what COULD happen and deal with what DOES happen is a great way to approach this. I was prepared for many issues that could arise and then only had to deal with my bodies reactions. The onco team is so helpful when you do incur a problem let them know and they will have a solution or remedy to help. The onco nurses I dealt with were very knowledgeable. Lisa - thank you for your responses. I could not get my thrush to actually clear up. It is the white yucky stuff on the tongue. Your MO can best advise you. I used Nystatin for topical treatments and did not clear it up quickly but did ease the problem and prevented it from spreading to my throat. I remember seeing some said to use L-Glutamine but check with your onc team first. For pain relief I made the \"magic mouthwash\". It can be ordered through the pharmacy many different formulas are available or a version can be made at home. I told him I was already using home version so he prescribed some lydocaine that I could add for pain relief. I used 1 part Maalox (I used Walgreens Liquid Antacid), 1 part liquid benadryll, 1 part children's advil and 5 drops of lydocaine. Mix it all together and swish for several minutes and spit out. I only added the lydocaine when I needed it. It will numb your mouth and throat. You might check if a prescription would be more cost effective if you have good drug insurance. It would have been cheaper for me but I had already bought the products. The standard baking soda and salt water mix is 1/4 tsp baking soda, 1/8 tsp salt and 1 cup warm water. Swish several times a day especially following a meal. I actually did this about 6 times a day. As far as radiation mapping in layman terms; it is where they draw lines on your chest to line up the placement of the lasers and I received 3 pin dot tattoos. Next they did a scan that went for review to the rad team. Yesterday I went back in for a simulation run, a run with lasers but no radiation and x-rays were taken to verify the proper areas were to receive the actual radiation. I will go live for my first treatment today. As always my prayers are with everyone.",

I have a followup appointment this afternoon with the surgeon.  Too many surgeries this year.  I think I am just going to heal and maybe start finishing revisions next year.  I did not anticipate all these hick ups.  Oh well, could have been worse.   Hope everyone else is moving along nicely.

One suggestion make sure you discuss sewing the muscle back in its original place and put the tissue flap on top of the muscle like it would have been with immediate reconstruction. Mine had to be revised in a third revision surgery and took me three more revisions to get a result I was happy with. I don't want to scare you but I was the 1% that had a failed flap and other complications. I feel everyone needs to know the good and the bad. Would I do it again? You betcha.This seems to be a fairly common method to do delayed especially if they think you might require additional treatments. You have to go with your gut. I decided to do delayed even not knowing if I would need radiation. It was just a small chance going into surgery but my tumor was deep near the chest wall and after surgery they found DCIS in the tumor bed so we made the right decision because radiation was needed after all. Good luck as you go through this difficult period of decision making. I hope my comments possibly helped.",

Flaps are great for feeling warm and looking like real breasts as far as they bounce with you and age with you as well. I just wanted you to know anything is possible. If you encounter complications, you can still get the same final results but it may take a little longer and a few more procedures. I definitely did not want to scare anyone away. The majority of people have one flap surgery and one or two revisions only. I don't know if there will be time to squeeze in the nipples this year. I saw my hand doctor yesterday and he said I could not put off my carpel tunnel surgery any longer. I will do my right hand on Dec 19 and my left hand on Dec 29.

I do not know if it has been resolved yet. I am letting them fight it out first. Tomorrow I am having a carpal tunnel surgery and I was told to call the anesthesiologist (I was actually given his cell phone, the doctor himself answered and talked to me). I asked if my insurance is in network. Of course, he isn't. He said he would work with insurance and I would probably have to talk to insurance as well, to get the bill paid. He said they have to do this all the time because they are doing services at the hospital and the hospital is in my network and my surgeon is in network. Insurance is being greedy with what they are paying them. Sounds like the anesthesiologists are banding together and none are joining the networks. I see a power struggle starting. Hopefully, this will resolve itself without many patients taking the hit. I hate paying big premiums and then having to fight for payment of doctors for their services. Good luck getting your bills covered. Be persistent it may take awhile. ",

After the first treatment I could feel the tumor shrinking, this gave me the will to continue on with a smile on my face. I did end up with a near complete pathological response.

Not to worry anyone but I want people to know things can go wrong even with a great surgeon. My surgeon has performed over 2000 flap surgeries with a 1 % complication rate. Things can be fixed but take time and may not be perfect but livable. I am scheduled for February 20th in San Antonio for a final revision surgery. I will be using a doctor at PRMA. My original flaps were performed in Houston. This will be my 6th revision following a flap surgery with complications. This time we will be adding some fat volume to the upper chest area to hide the animation I have from my flap being put under my pec muscle (not usual but that is what I got). I also lost my fold under the second flap breast so it is about 2 inches lower than it should be. They will try to move it up but only about a 50% chance of success. They are also going to remove fat from the side under the armpit on that side as well. I am about 2 inches wider on this flap than my other side. Finally I am going to have my abdominal incision modified and fix a hernia or weak muscle as well. This will be my last surgery. I already had nipples reconstructed and tattooed last year. I went to the gym and worked with a professional to strengthen my abs and the conclusion is my abs are great it is the connecting muscles that we could not rebuild. I can no longer do sit ups, or roll over in bed without lifting my side off the mattress, or squat and get up without getting on all fours. My abdomen is as hard as a rock and I look 4 months pregnant most of the day. I decided to try one more fix for comfort. Hoping they find what is causing this while fixing my abdomen.",
