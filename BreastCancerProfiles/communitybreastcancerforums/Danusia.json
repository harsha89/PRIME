I had my mastectomy on September 9th, we had to be at the hospital for 6:45 am and I was operated at 8:00 am with MX to the left breast with TX.  At 2:00 pm the same day my son and daughter were ready to take me home and I was in such pain they told them to come back in ½ until the nurse could run morphine through the drip to hold me over enough to get me home.  Post-op my PS only prescribed 12 Darvocet and that was it... In hindsight, I feel that they should look at keeping mastectomy patients in at least overnight here in Ontario. Coulda, woulda, shoulda.... Hind-sight! Dana",
