Sooo relieved and hope it all dies down soon. Those firefighters are true heroes and all the others involved too. Glad not just my DH who is a pain in the butt lol. Plumber is a real gentleman and his sidekick is his nephew. They have covered all my stair carpet with huge sheets. They love tea ha ha  so my kind of workies. Most bits sink, bath, etc out in the back ready to be taken away.  I have working loo out by my sun room ( thats a laugh sun ha ) so can drink tea until it comes out of my ears. DH is a handyman but I insist we get professionals in for this. He like yours is a perfectionist and drives me to drink  (  I should be so lucky  ) I have told him to leave them in peace as the plumber has been doing this for many years and comes highly recommended. The last time we had a bathroom done in our old house, I think it took the fella about six weeks !!! I used to come in from work to see the toilet sitting at the top of the stairs like a flippin flower vase. He would then put it back, then next day flower vase again ! Then one day he couldn't come as he had to bury his cat which had died in the night  When bathroom was finished it was lovely but thank goodnes we had agreed on a set payment for the whole job not an hourly rate, we would have been bankrupt lol. Has DS been ok with the smoke etc. Bet he finds it all fascinating. Keep safe  ( hug ) x Carla, have a big chunk of cake for me, and a truly lovely Birthday.x Better stuff this netbook behind cushion before Happy Harry as DH is known comes back with extra milk for all these teas. All you girls take care of yourselves, healing, peace and love to ALL of you xx",

He just caught me !! he was asleep on his settee, he has worked so hard today bossing the plumbers about.They were amazing, ripped out old bathroom, built units to house the sink and posh new loo. Then left everywhere immaculate. Even brought down their tea mugs. Putting in new ceiling tomorrow with spot lights. It will be like being a movie star. We have solved the Edi needing to pee problem I am in the sun room ( ha ha ) where we have a bed settee, right next to downstairs bathroom !! Looking out at the beautiful night sky and sending love to all of you. Traii, hope that wind has dropped and you are still safe.DS and fireman Sam really cute.Your DH making them knock down a wall !! Here the brickies would have walled him up in it. By the way the plumber is good, but pretty ancient and he pees more than me.lol. If DH sat on my notebook he would be fishing his wedding tackle out of the stream at the bottom of our garden. Dakota, sorry about the cockroach bit but couldn't think of anything in the insect world that is nastier. you have emerged from your chrysalis and turned into a beautiful glass butterfly. One of God's loveliest creatures. He shouldn't even inhabit the same planet as you. Nihahi, All work on house going well, so sad that it takes BC to make things finally happen, but at least something good coming out of it. DH's handy or not can still reek havoc lol. The fatigue really kicking in today but mine thinks I am immortal, suggested I iron new bedroom curtains, he got told where to shove curtains plus iron and board.lol Luvmy, we know you are out there as are so many amazing sisters. Websister, Did sleep last night thanks but eyes still want to close most of today. Think I will try a good walk tomorrow.Hope you enjoyed pj day ? Keemo, skiing ? GO GIRL hope you have fun. Scottie, gonna look at that book. I too get scared when have to leave the house, feel safe here. Got to have my diabetic blood test on Friday and already apprehensive. Will maybe see if I can get some calming type of tablets. Benny, last but not least. That last pic of you and Di made me cry a little. So beautiful !! Pic of those flamin spuds and water are priceless. Glad you are taking fuel onboard. You will be back to full strength before you know it. DH crashing around in the kitchen. Think he is feeling neglected lol. See you all tomorrow God Bless and keep you safe xx y",

Love you both and wish we could meet for coffee and cakes but we would probably be thrown out for being naughty. Benny, please take on board the words of wisdom on here from the ladies who have been there. You MUST get lots of good food and build up that body, THEN exercise. You will just end up back at square one otherwise. Visit Di and enjoy every minute, she needs her Mom back, but fit and healthy. Scottie, Good luck with MO check.

Went back to bed upstairs,had less liquid before bed and only came down to loo now ! Kettle goes on and then HAVE to check you all. no way will DH be up at this time so safe from hiding netbook lol. Even tho very tired yesterday once  plumbers arrived I had a quick nap, had a banana for some energy then took myself off to shops. BLISS. I have a bag with wheels due to not carrying heavy things and how the wheels didn't  fly off into space I will never know.It was full with three more bags hanging off the handles. Just bits and bobs, posh loo roll for when bathroom done. bits of groceries and a NEW DRESS, I am addicted to sweater dresses and warm black tights, so comfy. Came home made Quorn cottage pie with spring cabbage, raspberry sponge and custard ( For DH only   ) I ate every scrap of the main meal and actually enjoyed it for the first time in ages. DH went into s/room to watch footy I started to catch up on TV and SPLAT must have nodded off. Was awakened by my prince yelling, he thought I was unconcious !! Jeepers I was sooo deep asleep I hadn't heard him crashing about like a baby elephant. Went up and splat again. Feel great,will see if it lasts. Liefie, You are right things do get better, thought of you as headed out yesterday, Love that you close laptop. We are the SECRET WARRIOR SISTERS lol. Will give my boy that extra hug, don't think he gets many DIL holds onto his hand when they are here, all show for my benefit. Hope your eye all better ?

Tidied around then read all these posts. You are amazing sweetheart, love the way you have your head in the right place re the MX. I too have DD boobs and always cringe when they lift them up as if they are bags of spuds lol. If I was forty years younger I could have made a fortune as topless model ( If it wasn't for the face ) When you have recon can you have same size or chose different cup size ? Friday yay, last day this week of wrinkly butt and mate. They have been so lovely. Yesterday avo I dozed off in my recliner, as I woke he was walking on tip toe to the other loo as not to wake me !! Electrics and tiling today I think. Rest should be in by middle of next week DH will be  calmer then. As the bath was put in yesterday and is sooo snug can't be removed then put back he is twittering on about how is the tiler gonna finish that wall over the bath. Edi says probably by standing in our new bath with his huge boots on and walking up and down. Thought DH was gonna cry lol. For heavens sake they have been in business for years, sure they know what they are doing. How's DS and kindy, half term here so GD's costing their Mummy's a fortune in holiday club. I usually help out but really haven't the energy Right now I guess 7.00 pm with you enjoy your evening xxxx Keemo, so glad you survived the rash girl episode xxx Websister, I know when we have kids our bodies are no longer our own but photos gosh. Lovely that he thought GD was your little one I too would have forgiven him ANYTHING x Liefie, You and the cockroaches !!! Need those diapers here. That story so funny but really horrendous too. I think they are bigger where you are so I would have had hysterics too. Once after we had been \" bombed \" DH was taking a wall back and as he pulled of architrave they were in between each brick dead or dying. Edi went out of the house like a flamin rocket.  my neighbour was eating grapes in bed ??? went to pick up one she thought rolled to end of bed and guess what, it had legs, she ran into street in her baby doll nightie lol. Sweet and sour pork, my mouth is watering. Might indulge at weekend. Nice YOU could have a treat while sorting DH car. x Nihahi, Death to the alien, ice the bugger into a stupor and you just have a pj and pamper yourself weekend. x Dakota, you have fun x 46 and single, keep that chin up, you are getting there x Curveball, (( HUG )) x DH wil be crashing around in a minute, day of haunting the plumbers ahead lol Scottie, need to hear what you have been up to this week x Everyone else luvsya xx",

You take care driving tom, do you take yourself there and back ? Had a good chat to onco who was really chatty and smiley for a change.Given me something to stop sore mouth before it starts. Apologised that CMF knocked me sideways. I asked when Rads starting and he was horrified that I hadn't started already, seems they should have been going on alongside CMF. He rang the department and really gave them a lecture. Getting mapping and Tat next tues after chemo then may start pretty soon after that. In pockets with cupcakes, emery boards and various beauty aids. No giggling when the sisters start the massaging. Sure Dakota will smuggle in Cabana boy as a little treat for you. xx  ",

Sure the girls are right tho as come on, his beloved is having major surgery. Surely they can't be that heartless ? Sending out Reiki vibes to the powers that be for you right now. Love the comment about DH, soooo funny, you are on my wavelength. He had been for the bathroom mirror while I sat on the baby, so was already in a foul mood, while he was out some insect ( probably Dakota's Cockroach) bit his wrist. The face on him !!!! It was itchy and red ( his arm Nihahi ! ) you would have thought he was about to shuffle off this mortal coil. As we lugged the piggin mattress from room to room had to stifle hysterical giggles. YAY I would normally have raced around with ice and ointment, but bollocks to that last night. Then we slept in seperate rooms ,as he was in the bed we moved, me in our room in the other one. I could even hear the road drill thru TWO doors. We are going back to double bed this week, so have to go back to fighting for the duvet. Bought a very big duvet, but bet I still have to hang onto my side like a limpet. Good part is we now will have two other bedrooms with beds for me to escape to lol. Your part of the world sounds like a little bit of heaven  must be like walking in paradise. Our wildlife consists of the odd squiggle ,as GD calls them pinching the nuts put out for birds. Neighbours feral cat killed and ate a beautiful Robin the other day before they could stop it.  Karma in the shape of a large truck  with wide wheels needed. Now you just breathe deep that mountain air, and we will all send out vibes for your DH to be exempted. Big ((( HUG ))) X Liefie,my dread in life is jury duty. Have avoided it so far but I am terrified of it happening. Since the surgeon massacred my insides at the birth of my son, when I need the loo have to get there VERY quickly or woops. Someone said there is no chance they would exempt me so hope they got good air freshner. Hope you didn't shove niahahi too hard in Traii's pocket. x Movie, so glad you could get out of jury duty. Wow your Mom a fantastic age !! You keep that chin up, and breath deep. You are doing great. x Traii, hi cyber baby girl. Cyber Mum bit hyper with the steroids but quite like it !! Just hate the splat when they wear off. Hope your session went ok ? and se's minimal. Plumbers on the finishing off and connecting up water, elec etc today and DH at work ! Going to have a lovely potter and then Bingo tonight, DH will be finishing work when I am out, so beans on toast should be easy for him to manage. Might grate a bit of cheese to sprinkle on the top IF I can get it out of the mousetrap lol. Starting the C tablets this morning, so gallons of water to be drunk, please god the loo connected upstairs or  I am going to be knackered stomping up and down stairs all night.  Has the rain helped the temperature and atmosphere there. Cold but at least no snow here. Hope you can sit and admire those nails today. x Back later Luv to all XXXX",

Felt weak, tired and wanted to just give up. Everything that could go wrong did just that. Electrics caused horrendous problem which took hours to sort and entailed the contents of the loft being brought down and walls being ripped out !! Wrinkly butt is a genius, he found the fault in the boiler cupboard a switch in there had blown. First time in forty years he had that particular fault. My horrible SIL had installed that particular switch so might have known !! GD came to see Nana after school and that gave me a burst of energy. She cuddled me and gave me a lecture on dinasours, very interesting lol. ED said the teachers had planted an egg in the playground and the little ones all think it is a dinasour egg. Cute. Bathroom gorgeous but tiny bits to be finished.Got a break for a few days and can have a soak in new bath Sunday when silicone has gone off. YAY. Slept for 8 hrs with many wees but DO feel better today. Benny, So good to hear from you, if you are feeling low ( not surprising after what you have been thru ) please get good healthy protein in and get help.

Just on them for a short while but got me over worst time of my life. big ((( HUG ))) X Nihahi, Again you are right. DH became really concerned after plumbers left. Cooked me some tea and made up bed in back room. I fell in at 10 pm and got up at 6am for tea and log in. He is out all day with \" the lads \" they meet up once a month for lunch and  few pints. Bed still there so may throw myself back on it if weary bit starts again. Will keep prunes in reserve lol. Wildlife wow, hope you enjoyed your outing. Will get Mum to say Hi to your folks. What a lovely heritage you have. How did they meet ? x Hoya, how lovely that you are cancer free  x Movie, Hope you are feeling better ? We gotta have a giggle haven't we ?  x Liefie, I am on DH's side your rest so important. You can always fit in excersise later.

Just woke from a nap    can't wait for bedtime. Only 8pm and DH snoring on his sofa too. Wouldn't you knpw DS not doing naps when you need to rest. Swear they start being a pain like ALL men from birth. Did retail even tho I felt like sxxt, had spent morning sorting GD's bedroom into order. We went anyway and DH went all funny half way around the shops. Said he felt strange an is complaining of pins and needles in his arms and feet, Told him we would go to walk in centre at hospital on way home but he wouldn't. He has put on new doorhandle in the bathroom since we got back, then sorting his tool box. I give up lol. We had sausages and mash with onion gravy and mushy peas. I really enjoyed it appetite seems to be returning. SE's not to bad this time, Only needed throne room twice on Thursday, Friday and today normal. If rest of CMF this good it will be great. Just the tiredness is yuk. Think you need glasses sweetheart, pretty is not something anyone has ever called me. I do thank you for that. Made my day. GD coming tomorrow Nana has to help make Dr Zeuss costume for book day in school. Hope you have a good nights sleep BIG ((( HUG ))) XX  Nihahi, We had fog this week isn't it horrible ? hope yours clears for your weekend. Sure your friends would be devestated if you didn't go, you just try and have fun, Sorry to hear you had the weeps. Sometimes it just hits you like a ton of bricks. You have a lot happening soon but you will be thru it and with a lovely new figure by the Summer. Glad you like bedroom, paper behind bedhead is not textured just wavey lines on a cream background. We have a red wall at the foot of bed and I found some red accessories to dot around. We do that in most rooms, have maybe creamy walls then pick out an accent colour with curtains/cushions and accessories. It certainly brightens flat walls up. We usually do maybe one wall in the accent colour. Living room is creamy with lime green accents and makes me feel as if it has brought outdoors inside. Don't believe in making DH work too hard lol. Poor you going thru CMF with a two year old like Traii, think you are both really wonderful. Hope Alien behaves and you have a BALL with the girls lol xx Dakota, you put those feet up if you can, xx All other sisters, have a lovely weekend lovsya all xx",

Yesterday I was lower than a snakes belly    if someone had offered to shoot me I would have thanked them. The lack of sleep didn't help, DH went to his mates ,thanks be to the almighty. Waited in for gas man. I was supposed to be visiting my friend but bless her she came to me instead. We were nattering and HE arrives, made wrinkly butt look like a greek god !! Checks boiler and tells me whole radiator system need a flush thru, only £ 699.00 felt like punching his lights out. Told him there is NO WAY DH would pay that, would he give in? would he buggery yap yap ,don't think he realised that even tho I am old and bald in my day was one of the best car sales women on the wirral so know when I am being conned. Rang DH and handed him the phone, he was then given a DH lecture and ended up with a sore ear lol. Upshot is DH has found someone else for £ 200.00 to do same thing. Hope that works out, gaze at my beautiful new bath and long for a soak. Carla, hope se's subsided and rash calmed down x Liefie, Swans leaving made me quite tearful, they are such beautiful creatures. You have a ball on your trip, it sounds spectacular. Main thing is to recharge those batteries while DH does his thing. Fish and fruit sounds good too. My cold water wasn't wrinkly butts fault, more my dozey DH putting off calling someone out as problem got worse. My house like that when we go away, feel like not leaving because it is sooo neat. But I do lol x Websister, Two hunks both named Joe !! You lucky woman. Bet my radiologists look like wrinkly butt. Think we should re name rads as fifty shades ? At least it will make us all smile. Jeep Wrangler woo hoo, that along with your new hair, look out world here you come x Nihahi, lovely to have you back, Pics are beautiful. You are right about mountains. We visited Austria some years ago and sitting in a meadow near the top of a mountain I felt as if I could touch Heaven.x Movie, you are in NO WAY a coward, just because you aren't doing chemo don't ever think you arent the same as us who are. Ducks and Labs in pool can just imagine it lol. Photobucket as Nihahi says works for me too.x Sheryl, getting closer to the end you must be so excited x Jennie, hope tears have eased, when do your Rads start ? x Luvmy, Hope you ok, no babas yet ? x Traii, Soooo pleased you found a lovely PC. All sounds fantastic and positive. New perky ,none droopy boobs ,what more could a girl ask for. What size are you going for ? I would like to go back to a \"C\" cup as now in DD or E and they rest on my tummy when not encased in scaffolding. Tats for nipples sound really good, hope you find some advice about them. Flip flops on honeymoon, poor you it sounds really painful, coral is leathal. Se's not too bad thanks, had six hours sleep so less depressed, loo visits not to many, like you just wees. Only one is Mucositis ,like our Benny, sore from tongue to rear. Have tons of meds tho and today bit easier. Hope your day is good x Caitlin, Dakota,Benny and all you quiet girls just hope all is ok ? Dh clanking about    so will have to shove this behind cushion, check you all later. X",

Check back and find I have missed some !!!!! Nihahi, glad ou were helped and hope you rest properly soon. I was really pooped last night  eyes drooping while chatting. Get into bed and like someone had put an electric wire up my butt. Then thought of your mountains and splat, thanks x You didnt overdo the insomnia at all, like dear liefie says it changes you and things get a bit irratonal but we love you no matter what  have a lovely week with no app. Gorgeous new gas man has stripped down boiler,( lucky boiler) and replaced lots of bits at very reasonable cost. Now house cosy as toast and gallons of HOT water, bliss. His sister has BC too she is only 42 but is fighting hard. I got hug and kiss on cheek when he left  this sxxt has some advantages lol xx Liefie you and DH at nurseries, just like me and DH in DIY warehouses. Lose the will to live after a few hours. Stamp my hoof and demand Late and teacake. Your lunch sounds much nicer. Hope he decides before you belt him with rolled up mag.LOL Hope DD nd DH are ok.still snowing here and on for about a week. Rooting wellies out.xx",

Had an amazing Sunday, GD arrved at 11 am we painted her Easter bunny eggcup first, then played a lovely game which has tiny animals and fairies in it. She then tells me we are  writing a  book. I was to be the author and she was the illustrator   We have a tray table ,the page would be given to me and I would write about each fairy and its pet, the tray would go to her and she would draw them.This took about an hour and Nana was hit with a terrible need to sleep. She held my hand while I dozed for 15 mins and she watched Disney chanel. Gently woke me up and we made Easter fairy cakes. She measured all the ingredients using my digital kitchen scales, everything was spot on. They were delicious and needless to say will have to made again before Easter weekend lol. Her Mum and Dad had packed up ground floor of house and moved into garage/upstairs, pretty stressful but all done now.  . Today bit of a busy one, Reflex and Reiki at 11 am then straight to hospital where I can have tea and hot toast, then first rad of the week, then up to blood test for tomorrow. At least all of this in the same area so saving on petrol/gas. DH will be painting bits and bobs, downstairs shower room is getting remo this week, like me looking tired and tatty. New sink and tiles and shower door/shower. Cant believe DH is in overdrive lol. Nihahi, you are soooo kind Movie star ha ha. Will paint my face shortly so may be bit more \" normal \" looking, love the twinkle not tinkle, very apt. Liefie's DH had better watch for coffee slopping down his shirt with you in his hat lol. Glad sleep with no meds for you, DO tell what on earth you dreamed about to make DH scared ? Snow has stopped for now, but -5 at least this week. Still nothing like you all have but we are just not geared up for this here and don't cope very well. ED is having whole ground floor demolished, walls moved and whole set of new rooms built. It turned out to be lot cheaper than an extension and wll give her large kitchen/diner with whole back wall of bi fold glass doors. Her Garden is 150 feet X 80 feet which is huge for here and when we have sun ???? she can open up house to incorporate the garden and huge decking area her future father in law is building. We are all looking forward to lots of BBQ's and parties. They are hoping to get married in the early autumn and have reception at home. Aka Father of the Bride Movie, without the hastle lol DH NOT allowed near, he will be finding fault with everything !! She has good team of builders so they defo DONT need his input. Hope Monday good for you xxx Liefie, Temperature sounds lovely where you are, cosy and warm in house so only going out when I have to. Hope you DH is not overdoing gardening.xxx Dakota, Sorry about Son's hockey   hope Soccer goes better, Don't let cockroach fool you, he knows his time is running out. Keep well and happy.xxx Traii, Carla, Caitlin,Bearcub, Bevlee, Movie, Benny Scottie where are you all ???? We miss you x",

My SIL is Irish decent and feeds you until you burst.  beautiful roast lamb dinner and I ate every bit !! Most I have eaten in months and it was soooo good. We always have a laugh talking about our childhood, some really happy times. His DIL was there too, his son had gone out with friends. She is a beautiful American girl with long black curly hair in corkscrew curls. She told me she is on a pill of chemo for FIVE YEARS. One side effect is her hair is thinning and coming out. She has severe Chrons disease and it is this or a colostomy. She is not thirty yet and is a very clever young woman, this is destroying her life but the pills are doing the trick re chrons, hope her hair loss stops soon she looks so sad. Today spent with daughters and GD's at newly opened kids play centre, they had a ball and we had a natter over lots of tea. Hope you all have a lovely quiet Easter Sunday.

OMG that was the start of the night from Hell !! scaffolding rattling like mad, lots of booms and crashes. DH trots out and wheelie bins flying about outside ( they were emptied yesterday ) odd tile from next door on our deck. They were stacked ready for lads today.

Scan showed the beast had returned  oesophagus blocked by tumour and he can no longer eat or even swallow water. DH and I have been up since 4am as we cannot sleep for thinking of him and his wife. They may be able to insert tube to get nourishment into him today. They are going to try radiation direct into tumour when they get him strong enough. He spent yesterday morning holding his new GD and she was smiling and gooing at him. His wife said that really helped him face the next part. Love chinese and donut mix utter bliss, I was gazing at a pack of donuts yesterday and had to stop myself giving in. Sure my sugar levels are potty at the moment. lol  For all my bessie friends xxx",

Gosh how wonderful that everyone is buzzing along and beating the bxxxh.

I had a glorious day yesterday, sun came out a bit but still cold and windy. Had lovely dinner in New Brighton, looking out overou r murky river Mersey, GD as good as gold. When ED picked her up we had our dinner then off to see the ultimate eagles, WOW closed eyaes and you would have thought the real group was up there. Finished two cakes and really enjoyed doing them, photos to follow but netbook tried to eat photo card the other day so been advised not to insert it. Hoping new laptop arrives a.s.a.p. My lovely son came today and we spent Mum and Son time, DH working so had my boy all to myself. Cakes were collected and one customer took 18 of my cards to take to work, she works in our local nick so hopefully lots of coppers needing cakes. Traii, so lovely you are back. My DH is soooo doing my head in so can empathise.Hope liver results good The mobile phone stories had me hysterical, your real mummy and I must be related !! I dropped my almost new rather beautiful phone straight down loo too. Think it was in my pocket just heard splash and fxxxxxg hell !! Don't ever take it in there now lol.

Going to check your blog, still bit depressed but not as bad and realise all this is the same as everyone goes through. Feel rather alone and if it wasn't for you and the sisters think things would be so much worse xx liefie, you are coping so well, soon all be in the past. Your lake sounds so exciting and interesting.

My BC buddy had both removed even though only one had bc. She said the other day it is the best decision of her life as she dreaded getting over one lot of bc and then it deciding to appear in other boob.xx Feeling suddenly awful sleepy so better get into my pit, Love to ALL sisters and will catch up tomorrow xxxx",

Hands permanently cold, anyone know if it is normal. Thought I had switched it off but it was on timed instead. He has only been in about half an hour and hasn't stopped nit picking !! Beam me up Scottie lol Shed man's wife is blazing ,the tv over his bed packed up yesterday and they won't fix it, he watches every match and was sooo lokking forward to today's. Here we have to pay for tv in wards with prepaid card he has spent a small fortune so far so not a happy bunny. She said they gave him cup of tea, mash and chicken pureed and he brought it back  they have removed feeding tube as not enough room for that and the stent. Hopefully he can take something on board today. Seems this is normal after stent fitted hope they are right. Jennie, congrats cake for you. Sure sisters will help demolish it. After my shower inspected the muti coloured boob, looks like sun burn but all redness fading and loads of aqua cream really helps.xx Maria, glad you not to bad, the upset tummy pretty yuk but body has to get rid of what they put in, usually over in a day or two and you can plan for next time. I used this time to have people come and see me here as near bathroom LOL. Just rest and get energy levels up.

Will clean it up and give to GD. Also massive bag of teddy bears, used to have them in a bedroom in old house so will sort out them too. Sad that we put stuff away and forget it when someone could have joy from it. Nihahi, I think you should all put Dakota in the running for President.

Wow it was so lovely. Food gorgeous put on two pounds in two days. Then we sailed to the island of  Mull and visited Tobermory where they made the childrens programme Balamory.The houses are all different primary colours and it was sunny too. Went today to hospital for check up and they seem pleased with my progress. Next one six months. Have asked for copies of all my notes and letters to read   through. Had head in sand for last year, now need to know all about my BC. Had a call this morning to say I have been accepted as a Womens Royal Voluntary Service helper. Made my day !! Then a phone call out of the blue from a lady I met in chemo many weeks ago, she rang to say that talking to me had taken away her fear and she has just had a MX and is feeling good. Gosh that feels soooo good. Having my induction Thursday morning and really excited to be useful again. Will catch up properly soon, LOVE YOU ALL xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",

Went to chemo this morning, bloods fine yay ! I have a water infection but as no temperature etc, it all went ahead, felt a tiny bit woozy in the middle but that passed very quickly. Out in time to get to station and meet my beautiful big son, went to our local for a delicious lunch. I only eat small amounts but they cater for me so I don't feel as if I am wasting food. My son ate more than I eat in a week ! Followed by syrup sponge and custard. When we got home after droppng him back at station,next to smallest GD was here with her Mum to give me a cuddle. Now talking to my fellow warriors. Life don't get much better. Websister, Thank you for the hug. Also for rescuing beautiful Benny.We are going to have to get her a \" Call hospital the minute you feel Yuk \" Plaque for her wall. But sure it won't happen again. Hope your Mum is well and content.x Liefie, Trip sounds fabulous, hotel magical. Your friend amazing. :Don't worry about the energy I couldn't knock the skin off a rice pudding right now but feel amazingly well anyway. You just bake and put all your energy into the presents. I have to bake a birthday cake for my friend tomorrow, he is 42 and wants Animal from Sesame street's head on the cake lol x Traii Cyber baby, You get that sun protection on and a large glamorous sun hat.OR ELSE !! Your little battery powered devil sounds real fun.Your in laws sound almost as wonderful as my \"lovely \"DIL. How the SE's ? X Dakota, hope you ain't overdoing things, little people are defo best med's in the world. How's your scalp x Jennie, How you doing ? x Carlads, you are one more step on journey and we all walk with you x Bearcub, Joanne and Bevlee  (( Hug )) to you too xxx Any ladies reading this and not sure wether to join us or not, please do, our beautiful valley has room for you all.",

Wore wig about eight hours yesterday and it was itchy couldnt wait to get it off.Today think will do the hat and fringe. Got a fringe ( bang I think you call them ) to match wig colour. bought fabric covered Alice band glued band of fringe onto this. I put it on then hat /scarf over and hey, looks like I still have hair under hat/scarf. It takes away the bald look.Really comfy. Round three sounds good to me. Feel really well this morning weird tongue didnt happen this time :-) They reduced chemo dose to stop the blood thing hope for minimal SE's. x Traii, I actually think your accent is really lovely, was big fan of Neighbours / Home and away when our girls were teenagers. You are right about our accents. Scousers could strip  paint with theirs and Leeds oh gosh hope your cousin stays a true Aussie. Seems so funny I will be having bowl of porridge soon, you are having a roast ! Yum. Now I understand why you went for the real hair wig. Dakota and I have the prickles. The underneath of the synthetic isnt comfy with any hair pulling against it :-(. Love your story of accidental hair removal when you were younger lol bet you looked fabulous. At my age couldnt get away with that one. I went out on our back deck and it was raining ( for a change ) as it fell on my bare head it was the most glorious feeling ! I looked up at the full moon and thanked the universe that I could feel anything. It could be worse and it will pass. We live backing on to a stream, this is usually about a foot deep but with this weather is now about six feet deep :-(. Our estate has been here about 25 years and it has never flooded but bit worried now. It has all stopped at the moment so hope level will go down.x Liefie, glad you liked story, writing keeps the grey matter working as sometimes feel as if brain has dissolved. Well done on the baking ! Sure the family will be so thrilled when they open the parcels. Love that you have some hair ! Wigs etc a novelty to me right now but sure after going through a few months of this I will be throwing it across the room when I come in from shops lol.x Have a happy day Warriors. Edi x",

Recipe for choccy cake as requested.     Pre heat oven to 150 deg Ingredients.  120 grams dark choc, 120 g butter, 150g caster sugar, 80g cocoa, 3 eggs ( beaten ) 1 teaspoon vanilla essence. Put heatproof mixing bowl containing dark choc and butter over pan of simmering water on the stove until they melt, stir gently. Remove bowl from heat, add caster sugar, cocoa, beaten eggs and vanilla extract. Again stir gently until all blended. Put in greased and lined 8 inch, 20 cm cake tin or as it doesn't rise a lot a sandwich tin will probably do.  Bake in preheated oven  150 deg for 30 mins. Remove from oven, leave in tin for 10 mins turn out and leave to cool. It is not very deep but is sooo yummy even a small piece will satisfy the worst chocaholic. I served with double cream, but also lush if you micro a slice for 20-30 seconds and serve with ice cream. My cousins wife who I made this for ,was delighted with this and has the recipe to try. She had to fight off the rest of the family who have no gluten allergies who loved it too. Hope you like it. Edi X",

The club soda is such a help and the baking soda baths too, for the Johny Cash lol. Don't worry about Taxotere, Traii was amazing on it considering she has a tiny DS to run around after. Epirubicin hasn't been a walk in the park but hopefully less se's with CMF. Thought you may be interested to know that my Reiki client was Lisa of  the Baldy Birds for Lisa.Her tumours have shrunk by one third and she is amazing. You and she would so get on, she has FIVE horses and four dogs ! Her chemo regime finished soon and all systems go for Florida trip in maybe March. She is strong and positive and even though chemo knocks her sideways she has never given up hope that she will live her dreams for years to come .

Benny, keep it up, you will smash this, get your strength built for next round. I see that you are not vegan but do not do dairy ? it IS a great source of protein. How about beans ? My ED is veggie and adores baked beans despite the wind lol. Don't know if it is a coincidence but after 2 days of semolina pipes are almost back to normal. Ground rice pudding also similar, soft and gentle. Have you a blender ? might be worth the investment, you could blend anything slightly lumpy to a smooth consistancy.Get lots of nourishment down those pipes. x Traii, Hope dinner out was as lovely as you are. DH adored his beef in black bean while I demolished a huge bowl of semolina lol. Good info off Nihahi re your arm. No he didn't put a loo next to me, but it is only few yards away through the kitchen thank goodness. That all stopped late afternoon and things picking up this morning. Mouth feels almost normal, thirst abating, little bit of energy coming back yay. Look out world Edi is back. Hope you have a lovely weekend x Nihahi, You are so right re the fatigue. I have been lucky so far and it really wasn't that bad, but this time totally different story but fore warned is fore armed thank you. Snowy owl, so majestic, wow. Mars bars were my favourite( pre diabetes,) in Scotland they coat them in batter and deep fry them in their chip shops ! It is known as heart attack on a plate lol.x Dakota, have a good weekend x Bearcbub, hair sounds good. Whatever colour mine comes through I am going to have it coloured, ( when it is safe to do so ) something warm i.e. like my wig, reddish blonde. Tats and rads hold no fear for me now, thanks to you. Horned owl sounds so majestic. We back onto a farm and so see lots of wonderful wild birds but nothing so glorious. Heron after DH's fish about the best lol x Caitlin, keep chomping the chocolate it IS good for you Doc Edi says so x Liefie,Baking sounds so tasty, do you deliver ? Jealous of your owls too x Carla, hope you still se free and your chemo bag not to messy lol x Websister, hope you are ok and Mum too x Love and hugs to anyone I have missed.

Met men got it wrong again !! Just wet. That is a relief phew. Nihahi, Translation coming. Sweetheart cabbage-pointed- hispi cabbage. Gorgeous steamed with black pepper and can be used in stir fries. Quorn fab meat substitiute, very popular here. Made from a mushroom like fungus. Comes in mince form or ready made into burgers sausages or chunks that look just like chicken breast pieces. Cooks quickly in sauce of your choice and is really low in fat. Makes a great bolognaise or shepherds pie and if you like the texture of meat but are trying to cut back on meat products ( we are ) is ideal substitute. I tried soya but yuk, this really does the job.  Think you can get it in the USA. Glad nose will get better and hope you have a glorious day with your friend. DH sounds like a sweetheart, at least he has a go. When we were little my Dad would get phone call all times of the day or night to change light bulbs for his friend who was a Doctor for goodness sake. At least they could change the toilet roll lol x Traii, early evening with you according to my world clock. Hope you have a super week off and the arm is ok ? Tennis reminds me of school too much  my racket was pristine when I left with just a scraped top from hitting the floor instead of the ball. Will try bit of bacon in my cabbage, sounds tasty. Don't think Quorn ( see above ) is available in Aus.My ED loves it and it really is very nice. They are back from London this afternoon and have had a ball. GD was trying on princess shoes in the toy dept of Harrods yesterday. Then the only thing she asked for was a bag of marbles. Just been on trafalgar sq webcam and saw Ed and GD waving to us. x Carla hope you ok ? x Benny, hope you perked up today x Dakota, I LOVE mash but one of my GD's almost throws up if she sees it. Hope you have a good week. When your next treatment ? x Can hear DH clanking around, mugs of tea time, take care everyone xxxx",

Really need to de clutter too and the local charity shop will be bulging at the seams when I do. After years of rushing around to work etc, we can sit and enjoy our little homesteads at last.

Only about 10cm deep here and DH is weilding the new snow shovel with look of pure joy on his face. we downsized from 5 bed house 7 years ago and it was the best thing we ever did, trouble is lots of stuff from last house still in boxes in the loft !

On the news some poor people have had to spend all night in their cars/lorries on one of the motorways.  They have even built snowmen there.  DH came home from work about 9pm, phone rings, he was in the car on the drive outside standing on the footbrake and holding on the handbrake as his car was sliding towards MY car and the front door of the house.Edi runs out with that amazing snow shovel and digs snow from around back of wheels and then grits so he can reverse out !! Only a tiny slope in the drive but could have been worse. Traii,My girls posted that pic on f/b with the \" I saw Mummy\" tag underneath lol. Thongs as luvmy says are naughty knickers here too. Wondered why your DS was wearing them, now understand flip flops ha ha. Hope 999, lovely post for Benny, good luck for June sure all will be fine. Dakota, you crack me up. The hair and lashes ! It is my one worry that I will do just that. I turned on our gas fire and nearly did the same. Just pulled back in time.Hope you feeling better and have a not to busy weekend. Carla, pics please.so glad you haven't been sick. I do the Ugg thing with my specs, they are usually on my head like a hairband. Luvmy,wig not bad is it ? will post other one soon.Hope DH has recovered ok. Liefie, my friend is in s/Africa at the moment staying with her daughter for six weeks she is 85 and not in the best of health just pray she never needs hospital !! Think her daughters insurance covers her. Mars to earth, love it lol. Enjoy Victoria and 2nd haircut. Bearcub. Do hope you celebrated your freedom ? My wig is so handy right now, keeping head warm. Websister, We can defo share him. My lips ARE sealed.Hope you are not too bad today.Mum too. Colonoscopy at 30, just glad for you they are keeping an eye on things with the family history. Glad work sorted out too. Nihahi, Those grouse are perfect for the meadow. What beautiful pics. Is that where you go every time ? -28 makes England feel tropical lol. Got to go and fiddle about with latest cake order. It is being collected in a few hours. Must txt and tell them not to turn into my driveway !! Luv to everyone. X",

Feel happier now and as Traii says CMF didn't affect her in that way. That person needs a good slap !! How dare she pass any comment at all, never mind a negative one. I have come across a few like her on my journey and now just ignore them. It is her loss not yours the bxxxh. Love the way people tell you what you should do, how you should feel etc and they haven't ever had anything worse than a bad tummy ache. I was told by a \"friend\" as she was going for her mammogram that she would be fine as she self examined. I lost it completely and told her in no uncertain terms how the hell did she think I had found the freaking lump ?

Also a report that higher instance of bc in left breast due to fact right handed ladies squirt aerosols or roll on the other ones with more pressure under this arm. Know it may be all heresay but I for one am using the solid mineral stick. You just wet under tap and apply. It doesn't stop you perspiring but has in it something natural to combat odour.

He sounds such fun. Strong little character like his lovely Mum. My DS was terrible when he went. Cried buckets,one day ,we had a phone call, he had escaped ! The little man had climbed on a chair and opened the main front door then trotted off down the path towards home. School was on a busy main road and they found him just before he crossed a busy junction. They had to put a bolt on the top of the door after that. No one had ever done that before. Ironically he became a nursery school teacher when he left college. Drinking quite a lot of water about half a litre with each pill, lots of tea throughout the day, is that enough ?Se's seem bit easier this morning except slight trots TMI sorry that went on all day yesterday too No cake order this week but big project for March 18th cake in red and black for a young lady. What happened to pastel colours ? Hope you had a lovely time at the pub x Liefie, More tasty bread yum. Hope DS ceremony goes well and they do some 60's music. x Websister, could just manage a cheese omelette please. Kenny sounds like a great patient. News on Mum fabulous, hope move back to lodge goes really well for her x Dakota, hope se's ok ?one more sooo jealous. How lovely that DS is a Moma's boy, that will never change.I adore my boy and even though girls are wonderful there is something a bit special about a son. x Nihahi, Ok what is a Timmie please ? glad you had a good walk I am out of breath reading about it. Re swan lake, wonderful magical ballet. When I was about six I was watching it on our black and white tv and announced to my Mum that the prince had no pants on !Those ballet tights have a lot to answer for lol x Luv to all sisters, porridge just arrived, laters xx",

Reading back pages on here is quite moving, we have all come so far and you will too before you know it. Lesleyanne, wonderful that you can now excercise, just take care you are precious to us. Liefie, my son was bullied too. We also took it into our own hands to sort and sure enough they became good friends. Nowadays all frowned on worse luck.

Nihahi,risotto is the easiest meal ever honest. Google risotto recipes and click on BBC recipes. loads on there. That is why I recommended them to Benny as easy as making mash if not easier. Making it for dinner tonight with belly pork, ginger and chinese mushrooms need things with lots of flavour at the moment. Having fun learning to drink hot drinks without using top lip ! It is infected all the way along inside, but now no problem unless it hits a hot drink Owww. Have cracked how to do it so gallons of good strong tea going down nicely. Need the caffeine. Our news here today is about a four week old baby boy who has been attacked in his bedroom by a FOX ! It bit off one of his fingers poor love, they have managed to re attach it.His Mum heard him scream and saved him in the nick of time, his tiny arm was half way down the animals throat. Second time in three years, last time was twin babies who also survived. All this is happening in the London area, not in the countryside. They are looking for food near bins in gardens and are getting in if even if windows very slightly open. Think there is going to have to be a serious cull before a tiny one is killed.",

Sorry that they have to receive her venom too. Wigs are wonderful, wear it with pride. No one ever believes mine isn't my own hair but I really don't mind and so lovely to be able to brush the back of your hair, check it is ok, then put it on lol. My BC friend gave me an assortment of hats too so now have one for every outfit colour wise. The buzz is also very liberating, no more hair all over clothes bedding etc. Don't know how your weather is but I wear a beanie hat to bed and around the house as it surprising how much hair does keep your head warm. Wish it was summer, I would even go out with the baldy look, maybe not to the shops but in the garden etc. So glad you didn't have the burning, Omeprazole tablets really calm this down if you do.

Nihahi, Thanks for offer of sorting out DIL, my son knows nothing of what she says, the crafty witch makes sure there is no one around when she lets rip with her comments. As for the hospital where she works, I know she is hated there but it is never her fault always the other nurses or patients. As she is an agency aid she thinks she is immortal sure if she was NHS they would have hauled her over the coals years ago. Hey ho Karma is a wonderful thing just keep waiting for it to kick her ass lol. Off to the mountains, Edi green with envy, will try not to wriggle and mutter too much in your backpack. Keep safe. Liefie, My boy is a Christian in every sense of the word ( it is his middle name too ) kind, caring, and gentle. He has never brought us a minutes pain or heartache. He works with adults who have various issues Autism, downs syndrome,etc. Before that in charge of Old Peoples home ( until the council closed it ) they all idolise him, she keeps quoting bits of the bible but I am sorry as someone said once, going to church ( which she does every week ) does NOT make you a Christian anymore than standing in a garage makes you into a car lol. Thrilled you are back to reclaiming the kitchen, we women really don't like those DH's messing about in there. When mine does I just have to button my lip. Keep that eye well iced. Websister, DIL does send DH into a fury thank goodnes monitor was returned before she arrived. Return to work gosh, wonder if I ever will ? Bit ancient now and do have my pension but just miss the company and interaction with people. Hope day with Mum goes well. Dakota, hope you aren't too mad busy this weekend. Websister right about me time, you keep it up. Hope you find someone wonderful very soon and sooo wish my son had found a girl like you. Adagio, Nice and cosy in your pocket today. Sure they will look after you. Let us know how it goes. You will be in my thoughts today. ((( HUG ))) OK need another mug of tea !! will have to dry decaf maybe that will help with slight burning. thanks Caitlin. Love to you all xxx",

You too must be in bits. Maria, lovely that you got rid of your cockroach and found a good man. So hope same thing happens for beautiful Dakota. Glad you like pics, once in a lifetime experience taken two weeks to get over the travelling. Carla, any news sweetheart ? Morwenna, congratulations on finishing Taxol. Benny, so sorry to hear of your visit from Johny Cash, hope all stopped now. Dakota, Liefie and Maria are so right about cockroach. How's things at the moment ? I am watching a re run of \" ROOTS \" on TV gosh life was brutal in those days.Have been watching programmes about life here many years ago and we really don't know how lucky we are to be alive at this time. Have been sleeping up to 10 hrs a night for the first time in years. It is improving things and weariness lifting. Don't want to leave the house though, and as it is raining probably a wise move.

      "Content": "Aug 28, 2013 06:13AM - edited Aug 28, 2013 06:15AM by scouser47 Hi Girls  Edi NEW WOMAN YAY !!! Sod BC I have a life to live. Thank you ALL for holding me up but it is as if a big black cloud has lifted at last. Will now bore you all rigid with my latest adventures. Yesterday spent most of the day in Liverpool with my bestie of 61 years Pauline. We hhad coffee and spiced tea cakes in the most beautiful coffee shop you have ever seen. Crystal chandeliers, antiques furniture, lovely comfy sofas. Then we linked arms to hold each other up and strolled along the main street. We were comparing how we are now to how we were in our teenage years. We could hear, she is deaf in one ear. We could see, I have cataract in one eye. We could walk quickly and dance the night away, I have sore hip, she has curved spine which is now painful. Best of all we could sneeze and cough without peeing ourselves !!  Childbirth has a lot to answer for. I said if you boiled us up together you still wouldnt get a decent woman out of the two of us !! Then the laughter started, we just roared and stood holding each other up praying the Tena lady would hold out. Beautiful young things strollong past gave us such odd looks  but who gives a sxxt ? Glorious Day. Edi then comes home and heads for ED's where DH decorating lounge whilst they are on holiday. She has apple trees in garden and had given me permission to scrump some. Edi with her little basket singing away in the sunshine. Next thing strange sensation in the crutch area of my trousers ???? I start dancing about, then POW bite/sting at top of my left leg ! Down come the trousers ( not a pretty sight ) and after much shaking of same large yellow insect flies off towards the trees. Leg swells up beautifully  all red and with three small holes in middle of lump. DH is loading stuff into car and misses all this ( typical ). Luckily I had some suitable cream at home which sorted everything later, txt ED and she informs me that her fella ended up with an infection which got really nasty from something lurking in the garden. At least it wasn't a bear !! DH would have been picking bits of me up off the slide/swing/trampoline at the bottom of the garden. LOL. Liefie, well done on the booties, great idea of Nihahi to knit another pair the same and pair up. The picture in my head of you and DH singing loudly on your walks is hilarious. Just glad you are all safe. Benny, You and me doing jigsaw together would be fantastic fun. Titanic one is only 500 pieces but really lovely.Will progress to bigger and better soon Thought of you and chicks last night, ED txt and said where they are glamping (Glamourous camping in a dome in a field of sheep and chickens. ) They can help themselves to the free range eggs each morning  GD found one yesterday and carried it around ALL day.She is having the time of her life, swimming in the stream nearby.They ate fish and chips ( fries ) on the beach last night for their dinner. Hope Mowenna having a ball in this country. Maria is in Vegas according to f/b. By the way my hair also two and a half inches then stuck at that. Have lovely curls that I love, had the back and sides trimmed as bit tatty but the rest so easy to look after. DH back after last coat at ED's so we are spending day at the seaside later. All not mentioned, ALWAYS in my thoughts and heart. xxxxxxxxxx",

Sure it all is ok but sending Reiki through the airways. My lump still there and sure it is getting bigger  now just think oh sod it ! Pain in hip and shoulder but everyone keeps saying how well I look so I must be. Your DH is priceless, you must be pooped today, spoil yourself. Don't fret about DD's weight gain, my girls put on more than that, but as long as they were happy and baby safe that is all that mattered. Here press making a big fuss about Kate after Prince George's birth. Dear girl pictured in her pre pregnancy jeans looking like a stick insect. New baby doesn't give you time to eat !!!! lol Nihahi, Could do with that massage myself. You must be a mind reader re DH I will put foot down with firm hand re \" EDI \" days. Want at least two a week to do MY things. If he doesnt like it TOUGH. My cousins dear wife is in our Cancer hospital very ill at the moment. ( not BC ) He doesnt want anyone to visit. If I was still volunteering I would have been able to maybe sit with him when he came to the coffee shop where I was. Told DH just that then walked out of the kitchen. \" Go and just sit there he says \" won't repeat my reply. Stupid man. At least I had a reason to be there before. Traii, picking up GD later can't wait to hear all about new teacher. Is DS still loving Kindy ? Must go  somebody is glaring and shaking newspaper. He is off out to have time with his friend ha, one rule for one hey. Still I am Bingoing lunch time, won full house last week so who knows ? Lovsya ALL xxxxxxxxx",

Cant't cough, sneeze or pass wind without someone there and passing comment. !! Just been to get him a bike for exercise purposes, hope he likes it or he will be wearing it. Took almost two hours of getting lost as sat nav wouldnt work to find the address it was for sale at. His beauiful bosses sent a huge bouquet for me, a litre of gin and pen for him.

Been for a lovely walk along the promenade at Hoylake, sat soaking up the vitamin D while watching lots of little sailing boats being put through their paces on the boating lake. Had portion of fries, then ice cream for pudding yum yum. Did weeks grocery shopping and looking forward to big dinner with lots of gravy later. Yesterday, spent the day on my BC telephone buddies training course. So interesting and met other survivors who want to give something back. We are due to start up soon. It is aimed at ladies who have no one they feel able to talk to or who just need to know what happens on this journey.Not everyone can get out to meetings and they think this may be the ideal answer. They already run ones for other types of cancer all manned by fellow sufferers. They are really helping there so fingers crossed. Just had a super Skype with Liefie  anyone else who has Skype feel free to pm me with your details if you want a face to face natter. DH just mowed front and back lawns now chomping on a choc ice. I am just finishing holiday laundry and new series of Downton Abbey on tv later. Ridley, I too have learnt a new set of words on here, restroom/fries/cookies all mean something different here. Have you more treatment to come ? The excercise you are having will build you up. I am finding I feel more and more \" normal \" after pounding the pavements/sidewalks.

Came onto back computer to sort out internet provider query and other bits and bobs. After ten minuted peace DH comes out to kitchen ( next room, through open archway ) and starts crashing through the freakin dishes ! I am answering queries for him on the phone and he is doing sign language ( very badly ) for things he thinks I should be asking BEAM ME UP SCOTTIE  :-(He comes to stand next to me with paper recycling bin on way to garden leans over and empties top layer onto Edi, I want my Mum ! Thank goodness he is now watching movie on catch up TV. Weather here yuk, 99 mph winds in south of England 1,800 homes with no power. 14 year old missing after swimming in the sea. WHY didn't his family stop him as this has all been forecast for days.? Not so bad here, sun shining bit of rain and tress waving a bit, at least they are still in the ground. In London large tree uprooted and landed on a double decker bus !! Morwenna,your poem was so good and glad they will be using it. Hope snow not too heavy where you are. You must be looking forward to singing in the sun. Websister, bet you can't wait for deport day. Didn't have one but my cousin did and she said it was a bit of a nuisance. Dakota, CHEMO why ?? Jo, lovely no chemo :-) I too wish I had been a mechanic. I was a car sales manager in the 80's and men seemed to find it fascinating when I could quote facts about engines etc. Think I know as much as DH anyway but still leave him to get messy lol. Liefie, poor you with the car, you must have been exhausted, those places are boring. I know beacause I spent 5 days a week in one for years.Hope new songs went well.Meeting with Adagio sounds super, ( jealous.com ) Nihahi, hope your break away was lovely ? Capt Philips not as good as hype, wait for DVD ha ha. Ended up with DH having a gob on because when he asked what I thought I told him ! Great story, Tom Hanks superb but found the way the camera bobbed up and down all the time gave me a headache. OK I know it was filmed at sea but so were a lot of Movies. Right must get off before crashing starts again and take a painkiller. Never do that but now almost every day. Try not to let him get to me but sooooo hard.

Morwenna, sorry meant to say LOVE your tree pic, you look totally professional honest. Liefie,Agree with you re the boy, mine are grown up and I have still nagged them not to go out today unless they really have to.Swimming in stormy sea for heavens sake WHY ? DH even drove GD potty today, we called in with some milk ED needed, she was stuck in the house as new gas boiler being fitted today. She has had no heating or hot water for a week !! Being British workmen they work better on gallons of tea and biscuits. GD did a jigsaw with DH and of course there was one piece missing !! They searched through all her other ones and it was there in the wrong box thank goodness. So glad my DH isn't the only one who interrupts whilst you are on the phone, I handed him the phone once while I was arguing with a gas engineer, he kept chiming in so Edi just gives handset to him, WOW he almost passed out then is all Mr Nice Guy to the nut on the other end of the phone. I couldn't believe it. Did yogalates go well ?Hope you are doing lots of strenuous things next week while trainer in Vegas ( not ) don't hurt anything lifting that coffee cup ha ha. Dakota, you brave thing having tats done lovely that they are good. must google about them as I am so nosey. Large pan of lentil and ham shank soup bubbling away on the stove, I love autumn winter if only for the food. All quiet on the western front but feel for the poor southerners tonight.     nihahi, glad you back safe, gorgeous pics. Laters gorgeous ones X      ",

Websister, loved Halloween story too. Momof2 and Jackie, keep getting better every day. Had a glorious day yesterday at Christening of our 72 year old friend, not a dry eye in the church, vicar said first time person he was blessing answered him back ! Mike has had bowel cancer twice, he was told his last scan was clear three days before christening so double celebration. DH and I rolled home full of gorgeous food and a little medicinal drink at 9pm last night. Today dear friend rang this morning to say she was trapped in her living room, door had jammed. DH jumped into his car, zoomed down the mootorway and rescued her.She was thrilled and he is chuffed with himself. We then went shopping for a new casual jacket for him, I was losing the will to live before he went and bought the first one he had tried, after dragging me in and out of half a dozen more shops.Pooped.com need a lie down in a darkened room. Hopefully internet renews tomorrow. Bonfire night here tomorrow, Booms and crashes in the night sky already, some people have no patience.

Nihahi, find a Timmies with a web cam please for when you all do the entertainment.It will rival any group in the world !! Dakota / Traii, have a fab weekend. Not long back from a walk from GD's school to the village war memorial. 90 little ones lots of grown ups and half an hour walk in the cold and rain.They were fascinated with the list of names carved in the stone cross. Their teacher said that even though weather was dreadful it was very apt for the ocassion.Little ones were so good and stood for a minutes silence ( miracle in itself ) Last night went over to theatre in Liverpool to see \" Blood Brothers \" it was written about 28 years ago and is an amazing story, funny and sad. It was my fourth time of seeing it. DH in back room with lovely neighbour who is sorting out big computer with him so Edi's fingers flying like the wind on the keyboard ha ha. Looking forward to weekend with ED and GD, Hope all of you have a pain free, happy and healthy o",

Liefie, so glad DH has found cause of pain.Fifty shades a load of rubbish, admit to reading first book quite amusing really.Face book sent it viral, shops here sold out.Just wish I had written the freakin thing, she has made a fortune !! You have a wonderful safe trip on Wednesday. How lovely to be spending extra time with the family. Don't you forget we need lots of pics. Sure family will help you put at least one on here. Like you, have been back on messages from Carla and as you say there was no inkling of what was to come. Her daughter had pics of her funeral on f/b, Amazing pictures on stands in the church of Carla and the sun was shining outside for the burial. Her family paid tribute to her and the community are now fund raising for the family. Her faith meant so much to her, someone said she faced her fate with a smile. That is the Carla we all knew and loved.I have promised she will never be forgotten by us all. Adagio, My church has a healing session just before the service and qualified healers take you o the front and place their hands on or over you. Really feel the need to go again at the moment. How did your silent retreat go. ? Mexico sounds amazing, my ED went there for her honeymoon when she married DH no 1 many years ago. Each day is a gift and we SHOULD remember that X Momof, Xmas tress can be such a pain !! Last year as I felt like sxxt due to starting chemo I just decorated a 6ft silk plant I have in the living room. Got lots of compliments Might move my ass this year and get green one out of the loft. Had a real one years ago, looked and smelled fab, just a pain to get out after xmas, needles everywhere DH didn't think of wrapping anything around it. Purple is a fab colour, my DD had a black one the other year,to match lounge decor. Nihahi, how did day in class go ? Hope you behaved LOL.You lifted our spirits and we know you are a good girl really. Whiteout sounds soooo scarey. Keep safe. X Caitlin, DH and I have been together over 50 years, very few shades of anything ha ha.Roast chicken yum. Basters are handy for that as they stop you burning fingers. I always roast spuds for a good hour, even when par boiled. Try scratching tops with a fork as you put them in roasting tin, and they get a lovely crispy ridged surface.X Websister, Baby's laughter is a tonic,looking at recipes for xmas cookies to take to my ED's ,sugar free, as two of us are diabetic. Found a tin of cutters in back of cupboard so should be fun in a few weeks.Happy crafting to you X Morwenna, Youtube video, fantastic loved it !! Feel as if someone has sucked ALL my energy out of me too.Was feeling really good but not now. Think events recently have knocked wind out of sails. You have also had a trip and a half. Good luck with work. Wish I could go back. X Traii, you sound super. DS will adore double decker, my friends daughter had a big red London bus to ferry her wedding guests from one venue to another. The grown ups were in their element too. Good luck with the milking. X Benny, Ckicken poop !! Diapers come to mind lol. Hope one of remedies given works. They sound like such fun most of the time. If anyone saw one in the window hope they thought they were having a senior moment. Wish I had your Doc, don't think I will do the counsellor either, they will just say need to bring DH along and no thanks. Saw 9 1/2 weeks, or part of it at least, ghastly film !! Can't believe it is a year since that chemo episode for you. Mine started Halloween so this year was poignant to say the least. Get the sauce on and that lovely mechanic around a.s.a.p. Gonna run around tidying up tip of a house, DH worse than GD's.Talking of which DD's daughter was 7 last week and wanted a sleep over !!!! Imagine house with 7 little girls plus a choc fountain. = NO SLEEP for heavens sake. Everyone warned her but she never listens, very intelligent but with NO common sense.If GD wants it GD gets it. Other GD spent yesterday recovering will try and post resuling photo after this, her face is a picture. Love to ALL X",

My last house was very big so I had my Nana's tredle operated machine in one of the bedrooms I made a floor length cover and it doubled as a dressing table. I loved that machine !! Never a problem with it and it must have been 100 years old. My Nan taught me on it and I made so many things using just my own power. Hope you get a machine back that will last as long.

Nana almost had the vapours, so six year old told me what to do  then skitted the way I spoke into the infernal machine as if it was brain dead. Think the girl at the other end was actually lol. She has just gone home to bed and Nana is knackered, She sat on settee wrapped around me and when her Mum said leave Nana alone. She said \" but I love her \" Makes life worth living. Caitlin, chin up chick, you will do fine, sorry you have to have chemo but it really will be worth it. We will be jammed in thoses pockets every time. I am just over half way and it really has flown by. Keemo, Pictures are wonderful, and your daughter is enchanting and so clever. Love the blue wig ! You and Benny are going to have such fun comparing plush toy stories Liefie, glad dizziness has subsided. Good for you getting to the pool I really must go just worried about the reaction to baldy head. No way am I wearing one of those caps that look like a giant condom lol Party for DH sounds lovely hope the day goes well. Ariom, Hi, another upside down lady.:From where I am anyway. Traii baby girl ,you are a true little angel. You were meant to meet that lady and bet she is now much more at peace after seeing the way you cope. Lovely that DS had fun and your Mum and Dad are so lovely collecting him. My GD has asked that I get her again tomorrow and I can't wait. No drive through tea then tho lol. Dakota, ok thanks, how about you ?Your son is adorable. Websister, Your Mum will be fine but it must have been hard leaving her there. I had to watch my Mum being taken to hospital after being sectioned due to her mental health at the time and her sobbing still haunts me. They do become the child and it is so cruel but she knows you love her so much. Sure she will be smiling in no time and full of her news about what she has done. Hope you are well. Benny, hope this chemo was ok ? Di must have been so thrilled to see you. She is the tonic you need. Nihahi, Tried counting men in tight pants last night, beats sheep hands down ! Carla, Do you feel any better ? All other sisters in my thoughts and prayers. X",

Me ed's partner is lovely and always grateful for anything we do. My youngest daughters, not DH is a male version of DIL. I have not spoken to him since August when he told me I was a rubbish nana because I hadn't volunteered to look after that GD. I tried to explain that I had been at the hospital being told I had BC.\" Thats not important \" he screams down the phone. You will never see her again, lovely cockroach he is too. Of course I do get to see her as my youngest wouldnt allow it but something inside me died that day.

Wow yesterday was a day and  half. Gas man came    made DH answer the door to put the fear of God up the horrid man. DH opens door \" hello mate \" he says what the fxxk ! Mate my ass. Gas man belts up the stairs to boiler and works away for 1 1/2 hours with much banging and crashing. DH then leaving for work and Edi hyperventilating   I defo have an angel on my shoulder because as he left Shed Man our dear friend arrives with pics of new GD. Then Gas man clanks down the stairs ALL DONE and HOT WATER !!! Off he goes. Wrinkly butt arrives, ( lovely soul ) puts on shower screen and tells me his test for tummy cancer ALL CLEAR, he looks years younger, the worry must have been destroying him, we know the feeling don't we girls ? Shed man goes and friend from over the road pops in to help with computer problem, cleans up hard drive and sorts this piggin netbook out. As he leaves lovely friend arrives for tea and biccies and fantastic gossip. She leaves, and in half an hour I tidied and cleaned most of ground floor before DH arrived home. I sooo needed something containing booze but had to settle for coke  ( drink of ) lol DH has dinner and then goes for pint with shed man and Edi slips into glorious bubble bath.. I then fell into bed and not so much slept as passed out. Today subject to Johny Cash will be out wallet bashing. Nihahi, 35 days wow you and the others going through this are amazing. I am ensconsed in my recliner right now, very comfy and supportive and have slept over night in it a few times. I understand your fears re DH and you feeling vulnerable, x Liefie, hope your duracell bunny's batteries have fallen out, and you are both chilling out.x Caitlin, DH's can be a pain but I, like the others agree on the cupping issue breaking skin noooo ,if I get the slightest break in skin I panic and bash on loads of antiseptic. Sure your practitioner totally hygienic but good idea to leave this off until all back to normal. Hope se's not too bad and you can have some lovely family time with Mum. x Jennie, 33 Rads is a bummer but all this is the means to a good end. Hope you get that cording to stretch and soften x Dakota, hope your weekend is stress  and cockroach free. x Websister, 2 Joe's again !! my phone call worked then lol. You are just as gorgeous as the blonde ,anyway the Joe's may be Gay ! now that would put the cat among the pigeons lol x Luvmy, all those kids, you must be sooo tired. Happy Anniversary too. Lilibet is our dear Queen's pet name as used by her Nanny when she was little. So sad about the one who died. Pic's would be wonderful. x Traii, must have missed your post about DS, please let us know how he is ? hope you are feeling good and not too hot. x Benny  ((( HUGS ))) xx Bearcub, carla  Bevlee everyone have a lovely weekend xxx",

Happy Mothers Day to all you Mummies. xx Had a frantic fun day yesterday, met my girls and GD's in local play centre. Had a cup of tea which I had to drink thru a straw, Mucowhatsit is beyond belief now. On fire from mouth to exit. Ulcers erupted on bottom lip, overall look like I have had Botox, trout pout or what. How dear Benny hacked this on top of everything else heaven alone knows. Rang onco and they recommended Igloo ,a product which encases the ulcers in a casing which allows it to heal. This morning up at 4am after 5 whole hours sleep and lips seem less swollen. They gave me so many meds for this after last time but lo and behold they didnt work ! Burning down to tummy so that even water is like drinking battery acid. Shopped like a nutter after seeing my girls, I sooo love dashing from shop to shop with my list and filling up my bag on wheels lol. Fed happiness ( DH ) then fell asleep on sofa, football comes on TV and Edi heads for the hills, sod that for a game of soldiers !! I hate hate hate football, here they are overpaid morons who cheat and roll around on the ground clutching their supposedly hurt bits like big babies.Rant over. Out for lunch with my girls later today GD's and BC buddy, will eat it even if I have to scream and bang head against wall after lol. Jennie, good luck with all the excercises and massaging, we hopefully will all look back next year and think it really hurt but I DID IT. Didn't know rads can cause lympho ? now dreading them. Traii, sorry  DS still not 100 percent but sounds like even 50 percent is POW.Party sounds fab, heat and a pool that is a far off dream here.

Was panicking about the ulcers then googled and found that if you mix half a teaspoon of salt and half a teaspoon of baking soda/bicarb in glass of warm water it soothes your mouth everywhere. Ulcers seem to be shtinking too. Had a ball at the pub, lovely roast and they let me do kids portion size ate most of it and really enjoyed it.  All the family x Nihahi, se's not funny but people on here going thru much worse. Refuse to let the bxxxh slow me down. Weird the way special days are so different world wide.

They are something I find fascinating and somehow spiritual. Know what they are and why they happen but amazing non the less. I have them on my bucket list and one day pray I will see them. Will look for that comet. I look at Sirius  the dog star everynight and say hello to our little yorkie Molly. They say the spirit of all little doggies goes there until you pass over and they meet you again. Two more lots of CMF 4 visits in all.

My present of a Meerkat figure called Sergei made me cry. he is on an advert on TV soooo cute and is bullied by head Meerkat and think made me fall for him. DH found one on e.bay and bless him won it for me !! He arrived mid morning Edi opens box burst into happy tears and so does DH. Will try and post pic of Sergei he sits by me on sofa, know I am a bit old for toys but I don't care lol Chinese meal was delicious, I ate whole bowl of wonton, every single drop ! DH had set four courses, they gave me a plate and I had one tiny spare rib and two spoons of fried rice and beef in blackbean sauce. Then really fancied banana fritter so had one. More than I have eaten in months and I really enjoyed it. Slept well, one wee which is normal for me and now drinking the usual mug of tea. PERFECT. Sheryl, bet you feel so relieved right now. Rads next step but then woo hoo. Sorry you have such a long journey but as Traii says get some rockin CD's and sing your heart out there and back. We will all be singing along with you x Traii, sorry you still not sleeping well sweetie, glad se's subsiding tho. Won ton is lovely.pork prawn and mushroom dumplings in clear soup with pieces of char sui pork like a mini stew and really easy to eat. Your wedding night like nihahi's had me HOWLING !!! I had to wipe my eyes again and again. As nihahi says those romantic ones only in the movies. One of our friends had a cracker of a wedding night too. He was showering which was over tub, as he got out he slipped and smashed wedding tackle on tub edge, after pain subsided threw himself on bed and like nihahi DH smashed head on headboard so two points of pain. He then proceeds to pass wind ( typical man ) not knowing his beautiful bride has a phobia about just that. She proceeds to vomit everywhere lol You asking DH to remove dress due to nails and those fiddly buttons had me in stitches, have a lovely weekend with family x Dakota, you go girl, lots of fun with kids. Please don't be scared darling girl, you beat BC BITCH !! stinking cockroach piece of cake in comparison. Nihahi says there is a keeper out there for you and I am sure she is right x Luvmy, You are right about only perfect man was Jesus a very hard act to follow. DH cleaning stall now that IS love. Did you get Easter dress ? 11.30 and not dressed welcome to the club. Bet our dear Queen slobs about when not out on show. Poor love has had a gastric bug for about a week, fancy everyone knowing you have the squits on every news report she must be mortified. Have a lovely weekend with kids x Websister, you too must be so relieved end of another part of jurney. Hope herceptin treats you well with no se's. Great not back to work until end of June, was worried you were back a bit soon. You so need to recharge those batteries. Hope Mom still keeping well. Celebration lunch after rads finished is on my to do list at end of April yay. Have a wonderful time with DS and family x Liefie, hope you are home safe and sound and not too wet. Never tried lobster, must have a go. MyMom always wanted to have a go and on a family holiday in Majorca years ago she had her wish and loved every mouthful. Snorkelling sounds wonderful on my bucket list.x Nihahi, just out of diapers lol. Your wedding night cracked me up, that would make an hilarious Movie clip. Meal was lovely would have been even better with all my sisters there too. Need pic of glam specs when they come through. I do spend on them as wear mine all day every day and they are an important piece of jewelry to me, like the way you make DH think you have saved him money, must remember that one lol. Sorry your DD and DS going through bad health riht now hope they get sorted and quickly and prognosis not too bad.x DH will be crashing about very soon Love to ALL not mentioned<going to hide netbook behind my new toy xxxxxxxxxxx",

What you said to nihahi was quite lovely. She is such a love that we must get her through this next part and I didn't realise she had been a nurse so perhaps a little knowledge about what goes on is not always a good thing. I feel you are a fellow spiritual being, Yoga is such a lovely happening I really should go back to classes or something that puts you in touch with higher side of oneself. Namaste is a beautiful word, my Reiki master and I use it at the end of a session. Hope your \"girls\" behaving ? Must have a nose at the Diep thread sounds like something I defo would have been too much of a coward to even contemplate.

Edi would have been the same, understand completely why you are all doing/done it and am in AWE of you all.x Scottie, hi you busy lady and thanks x DH adores Scots and our surname is a Scottish one yay! seems his ancestors come from your gorgeous country.x The gasman cometh this morning, hot water happening but still playing up. We are binning the gas board as a load of thieves and rogues. Neighbour has recommended a decent engineer. Have started to look at opening my own business. i.e. Cakes. Had started to distribute business cards and have two orders already. Can't face not having something to focus on when all this out of the way. You have all been TOO QUIET, just hope because you have had wonderful weekend need ALL details because I worry about each and everyone of you so come on warriors quick post required.!!!! Laters x",

Just been hectic and so much going on with my oldest ( 60 years ) and dearest friend coming for sleepover last night. DH goes into overdrive as everything must be justt so. Snow hit here in almost blizzard conditions as she was due to leave her house. She wanted to come so bad and she heaed off. All was fine and when she had been here a few hours her car about 6 inches thick covering. We had a gorgeous indian takeaway, I had prepared starters, ie onion bhajis etc then main meal was collected by DH, phone goes and he is sliding down our drive towards the house again !!!! He did this a few weeks ago  for heavens sake don't men ever learn ? ended up in my wooly hat and wellies digging snow away then putting cardboard under wheels so he could back off drive, it worked . Meal was yum, stuck to mild veg Korma which was the nicest I have ever had. Then when all digested we had hot fudge cake and cream. After good sleep 6 1/2 hours for me    we went to my Bingo pub for a full english with tea and toast. yum. I had booked a table and they had put vase of flowers out as they knew she was my special guest. She has now headed home again as even MORE flippin snow forecast  told you before  England rubbish at coping with snow and here we go again.!!! Finished first week of rads yesterday, loving every minute. The young ones who fry me are so sweet and funny. They love the fifty shades of pink comparison. Dakota, how are things re insect ? hope they are moving on. Have a lovely busy weekend with your chicks. I too have new eyelashes    Just realised yesterday more and more coming. Didn't lose all of them but they were sparse now almost spider like lol. Hair belting along can now pinch about an inch of white fluff.x Liefie, Your DD sounds like a trmendous hosewife, my ED has 150 x 80 foot garden and when they have had remo done I have said I will buy here the chickens and house etc. She wants the fresh eggs and GD wants some chickens to love lol.

DD and dad for taxes made me laugh, DH says our only come when they want something lol. Enjoy Hockey weekend. Love your DH and baby goats he is a sweetie. Enjoy Easter music.

Came home feeling really tired despite three naps. DH on MY NETBOOK ! muttering because the water feature was a bit of  disaster,( theres a surprise, not.) When unpacked looks like it was a return. dents in beautiful chrome tubes so DH not happy bunny. We took photos of problems and when the e,bay seller receives them they will send us new on and collect faulty one. Photos couldnt be loaded on ???? so DH seething. Edi went to bed lol. He is working early shift, yay ! so can catch up with things before it all starts again.HELP. Feeling pretty good  today and hope you are all the same. Johny Cash day, hope he decides not to visit. ED has infected sinuses after nasty cold, GD has chest infection too. Both on anti biotics so hopefully will improve soon. Ed's bifold doors fitted yesterday, look gorgeous, her partner is like DH, there is a mark on them and the wrong handle has been fitted. Think most man should all be sent to same desert island ha ha. Luvmy, So lovely to hear from you, wow you are one busy lady. So sorry about your dear goat going over the rainbow bridge.   lovely that DH there for support. Will gladly send my DH to sort out your yard. Can promise that you would be letting weird plants strangle him afetr a few days.lol. Baba goats coming on great, pics would be lovely if you can. Know what you mean about losing stuff in the house, do it all the time.DH asks what you looking for I say nothing because he \"helps\" i.e. turns all drawers and cupboards upside down. and it is usually somewhere stupid like still in the car. Have a lovely day. xx Will have a catch up later with you all, must go and tackle pile of laundry xx",

Stayed in bed again !!Gosh it does make a difference feel almost \" normal \" Getting new doors through to \" sun room \" lol fitted today. May pop to airport and jump on a plane to see you sisters because as you know if it goes the same as usual disaster will strike !! Had the best day in weeks with GD yesterday, she is the best medicine ever. We went to pub I used to work in and she had sausage,chips and peas with gravy. Edi's burning pipes have kicked in so ordered veg soup, looked delicious took one spoonful and nearly passed out !! Think flippin chef had dropped whole jar of pepper in there, it overtook the flavour completely. Tried to eat more as GD gazed at me, Closed my eyes at one point as pain was grim when I opened them she was gone !! Then felt tiny arms around me and soft kisses on my cheek, God was sooo good when he sent her to this earth. Jumpe  in car to  shops and we parked near my Bingo pub, in we go for pot of  lovely tea and diet coke ( rare treat ) sat in sun on big squishy sofa and she chatted away like a little old lady. Txt ED and told her we were on a pub crawl lol. GD insisted on stick on Ruby stones for earrings then informed ED Nana had got her ears pierced !! little tinker. Traii, Glad pic made you laugh, we need laughter like we need air to breathe. Neuropathy !! poor love, hope you can get respite, like liefie says contact someone for help you have enough stress with the flippin hossie messing you about. They better not schedule near Mothers day or the sisters will come and kick some ass. Hope you having fun in the sun with DS and DH today, did Mum and Dad have a good holiday ? xx Liefie, Edi naughty !! I don't think so I was like a vestle virgin until mooseballs came into play lol. By the time you get to the wedding you will have a gorgeous figure, hopefully with nice flat tummy. Mine expanding slightly due to better food intake ( most of the time ) so hold in pants may be needed. You stay busy, will soon be on road to recovery DD dor 10 days will be soooo good for you. Hope funeral went ok, xx Nihahi, I can't have a cake unless sugar free but may nibble a cookie. Excited that this part nearly done and can't believe how fast it has gone. Sharing with fellow Warrior Sisters has helped beyond belief. Hope you nearly upright and feeling better, so lovely that you don't have pain at least xx Alive, your post made me weep, shame we are too far away for real hugs but big cyber one on way to you. You cry, scream, swear like a trooper we have all done it, you will laugh again I promise but right now is the sxxxxy bit. The BC bitch may be lurking but is NO match for the warrior sisters, Mods are correct things have changed soooo much since your Mom's diagnosis. I have met so many ladies with the most horrendous diagnosis who are well and happy due to amazing treatments. Don't beat yourself up about not going to Docs either, I waited three months thinking it was just another benign lump which i was prone to. Main thing is you DID go and they will guide you through your journey next week. We will all be in your pockets when you go to hospital, please let us know how you get on xx Movie, venue is swish isn't it ? It is Castle Howard Yorkshire. Our dear Queen stays there when she is in the area. You can Google all the pictures.We are all nervous wrecks as we are a pretty normal family and this is sooo lush. My nephew is marrying into a different kind of family and he bride will only settle for the very best. If you ever saw Brideshead revisited it was filmed there. So glad you can't focus on things too, felt guilty that can't read any of the lovely books people keep handing me. Even magazines sit in rack unopened. Namaste dear sister xx Maria, hope you are ok, xx Dakota, hope chicks havent made you do too much this weekend xx All sisters xx",

Watering tubs etc is my job too. GD and I planted 28 little plants yesterday. She runs around with the hose showering them gently when they are planted. She came out with some comment and I without thinking said \" you are such a smart arse\" She just smiled and said \" I am the smartest arse you will ever know \" I literally laughed until tears ran down my cheeks and she thought that was great, she loves to make me laugh. Hope she doesnt repeat that one in school. Your food yet again sounds stunning, ham salad here xx Websister, hope that yucky pain easing. How is you Mom these days ? xx Maria,in one of your pockets Thursday, you will be fine  any problems check in here for advice, ALWAYS ask for help from the professionals if things worry you.

Today hopefully is fun later, picking up my darling GD from school, then off to New Brighton our local seaside resort. We are having dinner with her and a play on the beach if rain stays off. Then DH and I are at the theatre to see an Eagles tribute band. Two cakes to design and ice will keep my mind busy this morning.

You people in America have such fantastic programmes. Had coffee and two hour catch up with BC buddy yesterday afternoon, then quiet peaceful mooch around the local shops, bliss. Slept eight hours !!!! think this is defo why I feel good, lack of sleep so horrid. Liefie, glad you like pics etc, they are from facebook and lots via our Carla on there.They do seem to pop up when needed . You sound incredible, sad boys had to go but at least they were there for you and your son escorting you everywhere made me tear up. Nice you and DH caught up on sleep, DD next yay. Oxtail stew, wow send me some please. Eating like a horse at moment, don't want weight I was before as now only 2 pounds heavier than when we wed, and sure that also why I am feeling good. The bxxxh did me a couple of favours lol. Nails and teeth much stronger and bowel problem I have had for 42 years now no more. TMI but suffice to say can't believe it has gone, yippee.xx Alive, Thanks for sharing with us, foster Mom so special and has made you the lovely lady you are today. Love is all a flower needs to blossom. We have all sprayed computers with coffee lol may invent little pull down awning for when on here ha ha. We are all glad you found us, you are a ray of sunshine each day. Good luck with the planting xx Maria, you must be pooped. Good to have something but this sxxt to do and think about. Feet up time now.xx Nihahi, you tinker you !! Brilliant idea re pic of happiness with pink netbook ha ha, Will take one soon and when I find out how to post on this laptop way hey. A lot of times foster and adopted Mom's are better than the real ones, mine and DH's had sooo many issues from their own childhoods that parenting came as a bit of a shock to them. My Mom would flinch if I ever needed a hug and Dad thought abusing verbally etc was a normal thing. Your children struck gold when they found you and DH.xx Websister,How exciting that you have a graduation too. England starting to follow, but normallly only happens on leaving University here. Hope pain easing xx Caitlin, hope se's subsiding, had two visitis from Johny flippin cash this morning, bit of a shock but shows not quite back to \" normal \" yet. lol xx Movie, gosh dear friend no wonder you are stressed about going away. Hope DD improves soon.xx Will have to move my butt in a minute, have just eaten choc marshmallow so will have to burn off sugar by doing some housework Had fab bit of news last night, Ed had an interview for her now retired bosse's job and SHE GOT IT !! Knew she would but she has no confidence in her own abilities, her presentation blew them away. Her builders have completed so just decoration and new kitchen being fitted by FIL then they can move home. Life is good. Love you ALL xxxx",

Have had a glorious day in the garden/yard. Sun is shining, you know that big yellow ball ( ha ha ) in the sky. Only 54 deg but that is a heatwave here. DH finally finished off his water feature by adding spotlights, now he wants it to go dark so he can gaze at his work. Ed and partner been painting remo i.e. whole of groundfloor walls and woodwork. We had GD and what fun that was, think DH is toddler in old man's body. She found a snail, showed it to DH and then next thing we know is he pretended to eat it !!!! She was jumping up and down demanding the return of Richard ( the snail ) she looks at him and says I know you have hidden him, give him back. DH hands him over and then Richrd is kissed yuk, and placed on DH's water feature to keep him safe. Still feel good, just demolished half a pork chop, new potatoes,spinach and spring greens smothered in gravy ( best part ) then banana and cream. Will soon be HUGE lol. Shedman no pet scan results yet, he is mapped and tatooed for rads and is fretting about the blue dots !! He has an enormous scar from stomach removal so dots nothing, told him it is a battle scar, hope he stops fretting. Bank holiday here so everything shuts down until Tuesday. Websister, so pleased that your results were good news. You and DH look gorgeous on your f/b pic. Kenny and his young lady too.Hope back pain soon goes .xx Benny will join Websister in Happy dance Monday. You DID IT.

Edi cleaned and tidied like a nutter, to much clutter doing my head in. Shedman and Mrs came around and tea and cookies was all we were supposed to be having but DH went for more milk and we bought 60 chinese frozen bits. 18 mins in oven and after DH saying too many, they were gone !! Finished with tea and cake, short visit stretched to 4 hours but was such fun. Shedman was happy and think forgot about things for a while.Still waiting results, torture Nihahi, awake at 2am, I had a phase of it with no reason, now can't keep awake !! This rad fatigue really knocks your socks off. Glad DH story made you laugh, yesterday he decided  to vacum stairs and landing, near bottom of stairs vacum packs up !! on off switch broken ?? He shoots off and buys me a new one, tiny bagless and very efficient, goes back to vacum last three stairs and promptly drops the feckin thing. Touch wood it is fine but if it had been me the lecture would have gone on for weeks, as it was got shown how NOT to pick it up ( common sense ) but had to look all student like whilst wanting to strangle him with the vacum lead. Ice cream !!!!!!!!!!! I am so jealous, only ice ceam place is a good twenty minute drive away and people come for miles to it.We are so behind the times here. Golfing too, well done no ball hitting ha ha.

Our best one when we were minding GD's was getting to supermarket and as DH lifted her out of baby seat she had had an attack of the wild sxxxxs. Put her straight back in seat ( sitting on a carrier bag ) zoomed home, I dashed to run her a bath DH lifts her up starts up the stairs and trips, falls flat onto giggling baba who was covered in poop. Think he is defo your DH's twin. lol.I cleaned her up and he had to get a shower too. Would love to try a drive in, don't have them here sound great. Chinese even better. Sugar rushes are so not funny, glad DS was ok. xx Liefie, go girl you are amazeballs ( one of ED's favourite sayings ). Sorry DD gone but sounds like fun when she was there.

Went to the birthday party yesterday with GD's for three hours it was fantastic. Little ones played on bouncy castle and a Barbie Mat I had in the my Nana cupboard, you attach it to a garden hose and nine fountains of water erupt out of it. Cooled them down really well. Birthday girls Daddy manned the BBQ, and lovely buffet prepared by her Mummy was demolished by hungry hoards. Sat with my BC buddy and daughters and time sped by too fast  GD stayed over and we are watching Peppa Pig and drinking tea. To ALL my dear sisters, your kind words mean so much. Sorry to off load my misery on you but have never felt so lonely in my life. OK treatment over, but my life has changed and I am NOT the same person trying to adjust is really hard. DX was a shock but hey ho will just fight on and pray my fears are unfounded. Don't know what DH's problem is, but right now don't care. Feel like hitting him with the breast cancer husband book never mind getting him to read it. lol. Tried talking but he leaves the room or gazes at the TV and ignores me. Sxxt is going to hit the fan very soon if things don't improve might have to write it all down and post it to him. My little car needs MOT and road tax doing this week so something to focus on. BBQ with our oldest and dearest friends next weekend in Liverpool. Shedman is hoping to make it, he is on steroids and eating bit more. His poor wife is demented as he is sooo stubborn and won't do as he is told. Waits until discomfort really bad before taking meds which solve the problem. Insists on driving the car when he is weak and frail because \" it needs to be driven properly \". Hopefully I will be taking them to BBQ to save the rows. Hope you all have a glorious Sunday. xxxx",

We had to wait half an hour for the tide to go out so we could access the causeway leading to the part of the beach where it is. She climbed all over it, walked the plank and then paddled in the Mersey. On way back she had a donkey ride  then fries and a foot long sausage for her tea. Then off to ice cream parlour for pudding. There are huge rocks placed everywhere along the edge of the pavement, we sat on them facing the bus stop and half an hour later DH's bus arrived. Thought she was going to explode with joy !! She wrapped her little arms around his neck and kissed him. Then perched on little seat we went for short bus ride. Into local store to spend pocket money and bought a huge bubble wand. Had such fun with this too. Shedman may be allowed home today so we are going to finish his relaxing space in his back garden ( yard ) it is looking lovely with tubs of flowers and all the wooden furniture painted cream.Please God he behaves and eats sensibly and well to get his strength back.

Autumn has started here, dull, cool and overcast. Fire is on and curry for dinner, Nihahi, Yesterday had little chat with DH re retirement. Think message got home. We will be starting dancing again. I want to start riding lessons and he is looking at golf again. Told him I am not prepared to give up my life and friends and don't expect him to give up his. Also said I am going to train as BC telephone buddy later this month and he was NOT going to stop me.I will not have to leave the house to help others so how can he say anything ?Looked a bit taken aback but no arguments YAY. We went to the Movies to see The Millers with Jennifer Aniston and it was sooo funny. Good story and a bit rude but hilarious. Then we went to our local and had a late drink. Jo6202, heart goes out to you, as girls say this is the worst part but sure your team will help you make the right choice. It is your body and all repairable.Try and not worry but I know that is easier said than done. x Traii, Got a new dabber !! Not having the dirty looks again. Glad your girls now ok, proud of you If anyone came near me with a straightener I would smack them. Love my curls so much. You look gorgeous on your pic though. Liefie, skype was lovely, GD couldnt wait to tell Mummy she had been talking to Nanas friend in Canada who has Bears near her house.( she wanted to know why we can't have some too ) Sorry about dashing off, but good job I did, ED was still in with the Doc after 30 mins while they tried to get her an urgent appointment at the hospital. They thought she may have had a heart problem. She had also hit the kerb while parking outside and ripped front tyre. I ran her straight there, and poor love had four hours of tests and x.rays. Thank goodness nothing found. She has really bad pain in chest ,up to neck and shoulder and down her back. On painkillers and her GP keeping close eye on her. Her partner got from work to the car and changed the tyre then came to collect GD who had come back here to eat the contents of my pantry, we just said Mummy had a sore shoulder so no panic from her.

They have a high pinched edge which the Miners held them by when eating  to stop being poisoned by whatever they were handling. They are like a meat dinner in pastry and sooo yummy. Cougar story horrendous, hope poor lady survives her injuries. You and DH be extra careful PLEASE. Movie, tummy tuck and perky foobs, YAY you will be gorgeous again very soon. Been out with BC buddy, lunch then whizzed around the shops. Hit the health store and bought Turmeric capsules. Really good writeup on fighting the big \"C\". I also bought a box of organic Yogi Tea, Womens energy type. Supposed to have great results and heaven knows I need a bit of oomph in my tank. Had the strangest sensation this morning. DD rang second youngest GD not well enough to attend school so could I have her for the morning ? I jumped out of bed cleaned and tidied downstairs, folded laundry, then as I stood in the middle of the kitchen suddenly realised I felt NORMAL for the first time in over a year. My friend rang whose husband is also a survivor told her and she said her hubby had the same sensation three months after chemo finished. I am three weeks out TOMORROW. He has never looked back and I am Dam well no gonna do either. She then offered us her caravan on the magical island of Anglesey free for our hols. DH wants to go so fingers crossed we will have a lovely break in a few weeks. This island is off Wales and we spent many happy days there in our youth. Revving up to todays walk, on my own today, radio on, headphones in and look out here I come  Love to any sisters not mentioned but always in my thoughts. XX",

I was so mad and so upset I didn't do what I had said and go on my own  He is driving me up the flippin wall.  I have got to the point I dread opening my eyes in the morning.

Sure her wonderful family will support her through her grief. Agree with you re DH in that I am a WIMP !! Think he reminds me too much of my father and I was terrified of him. Must get over that and just live as I want to. Was having a skype with my cousin last night and he was telling me about our cousin clearing up after floods recently think they live in your area. Surname is Ryder know it is a longshot but you may have come across the family. ? You may feel like an Amazon but you need to be to get through the long journey you have had. X Carla, hi !! please keep popping back, we can't let our new ladies do this without the Warrior Sisters. X J06202, next year you will be off to Tucson again. All this will be a memory. Good luck with the snow this year. x Liefie, Will take Dr Phils and your advice from now on. LOL New hair colour going on tomorrow and sorting outfits for choir, Bingo, Dancing next week may even try the horse riding. Hope your dinner goes well. That piece of meat would completely fill my freezer. Would love a decent sized one but nowhere to put it. Every week have to sort mine or can't get anything new in !! Mom, northern lights on my bucket list too. I believe they may be seen from the most northern part of Scotland here so must look into it. My DD and GD arrived yesterday with their new puppy a tiny chihahua called Dougie. My DD wanted the smallest dog possible and he is so dinky.He had us all besotted by the time he left.

After we saw ED yesterday I txt her to see if new boiler all in and working. She was in bits, seems the fxxxxxg builders who did her remo had a halfwit plumber , as new boiler wouldnt work her new plumbers traced back to a leak in a wall of the downstairs shower room. Seems it has been leaking into the insulation for a few months and as this wall backs onto her new kitchen with all the new units everything might have to be ripped out and knocked down !! Then to add insult to injury this is probably why old boiler was playing up and they have probably wasted about £ 2,000.00 on a new one.

Happy Halloween to you all.This is one of my favourite times of the year. GD's now at parties after school but bought scarey masks for me and DH, filled dish with candy and waited. Door bell rings and we fling it open, a little boy dressed as a skeleton jumped about a foot off the ground !! His sisters werent phased and just took their sweets. Then he realised we werent really a witch and a monster, took sweets thanked us politely and trotted off down the front path to his mom who was laughing her socks off. This continued for a few hours and the children and parents joined in with the fun.Loved every minute. You all sound happy and positive despite coyotes  and falling up the stairs Can't say much as I am in the dog house  Provider says we have used up most of our monthly megabites or some such crap. Of course it is my fault again despite the fact that in 12 months of being on here a couple of times a day it has never happened before.As he has retired, DH on computer loads, but of course nothing to do with him. ( fuming !! ) If I vanish for a few days I am not serving time for murder, just waiting for next months allocation of mega things to start or we get a better package. DH still has back ache, now golf is a no no, his guitar group also, due to the fact they don't sing his kind of music. Running out of ideas. Don't really care anymore Won twice at bingo  £ 20.00 in total went on a little spree, YAY. Will catch up when back on line. x ",

Rest if you can X My DS just rang, he has been waiting 12 weeks to find out if he has lost his job as a care worker. One of his patients said he had struck him in the face, Know he is my boy, but a kinder more gentle man you could not meet. He works with elderly gents with learning difficulties and because he tried to help one keep his finances in order ie. budget his bank account and this person didn't like that, he said my son had punched him in the face ! The man spends way too much on booze and cigarettes but that is his business unless he goes over his allowance. DS has been cleared but now has to move to another placement ( company policy ) he loses thousands of pounds in overtime and has to travel much further all because someone lied. Really knocks your faith in fellow human beings. Hey ho at least he still has a job. DS being a Christian will forgive but his Mom won't, Karma please kick in. Hope you all have slept well.

A beautiful and gentle soul who examined me and then answered every question When she had finished I practically floated out of the room. She added that she had just seen a lady 8 years out with TN and there was no reason I shouldn't be the same. OK know she isn't going to do the doom and gloom bit but as she said so much rubbish info out there on the web just stay positive. Six months until next one. Phew. Any problems I have to ring straight away and they will be sorted. She did say the period after treatment the worst part as we feel so lost. Pictures of xmas trees are really lovely.   GD's  school xmas show in the morning, she has seven lines, and was word perfect when Mummy and Daddy saw today's performance.

My nails too are no longer splitting and peeling and that is 10 months out of treatment. Hopefully these se's stay. We might have mostly finished being chemoed and cooked but it is all still raw when you look at your scars and tats. Badges of honor.  Websister, take care of yourself you are precious to us. I have reflex on Monday right by the hospital so going to call and ask re bone scan. Nihahi, would love to turf out your cupboards for you anytime. Years of being a cleaner for rich people made me an expert. They are the worse I promise you. Can't believe how cold it still is where you are.Parts of England still under water, insurance companies dragging their feet sorting people out too. Heading towards dream time, having some really weird ones right no:-( w  Blessings and peace to everyone.   ",

He is crashing around in the loft right now looking for something, I will get told off when he comes down as it is a tip !! All my fault oops. Fries and eggs sunny side up for dinner as he is cooking. One of my all time favourites. Hope you all like the warrior picture from Benny she is moving on really well.

Today we are jet washing the back deck, planting some desert like plants in the front garden as front of house quite dry even when it rains.  I am so excited as having an Easter egg hunt a week on Sunday so got to get everywhere ready.GD has been making paper chains to hang from everywhere out there.

Can't believe the politics involved between the various charities !! This and that must not be done, because so and so will not be happy etc. Thought we were in there to  help and support people not score points of other charities.So tempted to give it all up but it would mean being stuck at home even more than I am. That then means more time to think and I don't need that 😞 Onwards and upwards 🙆",

I used to jot down notes along side names and then can answer or comment on various things without trawling back to see who is who. Sorry that you had issues re leaving the house for treatments. Sure you aren't on your own. Also the Docs don't know what causes reoccurrence so just onwards and upwards with next step. As you probably have gathered I am from Liverpool 😁 We also have one other from Liverpool, Jackpot, I had the pleasure of meeting her as she was being treated at the same hospital. I love to hear about the differences in treatments/scans etc with the girls on here. All in all think most things are very similar ,except we don't have the insurance issues. We are lucky. Good luck with avatar. Tried to change mine and lost it completely 😕 Love to everyone. Sun shining need to dust !! ",

The next day I will have an injection of something to stop it happening next time, YAY. Have you got a wig yet ? I LOVE mine, didn't expect to, but feel really normal again. Went into pub I usually work in tonight and caused a riot ! Everyone said when my hair comes back I must keep that colour and style. Reddish blonde with light blonde streaks. Shoulder length layered.  It is only synthetic one and everyone wanted to touch it and couldn't believe it wasn't real hair. It was only twenty five british pounds in our local market. Cheaper than a good hairdo, lol. Liefie, agree that you are inspiring. X Off to bed, too much excitement for one day, love to you all Edi.",

Hope none of you mind if I practise writing in preparation for starting  THE BOOK. All put feet up, get a drink and relax. TUESDAY TALE. Things have moved on apace in the lush green Warrior Sisters valley. They have built a beautiful permanent home on stilts astride the stream which runs through the centre of the valley.It provides a fantastic vantage point to watch for their enemies, The Chemo and less vile Rads tribe. Dakota is in her element winching up the logs she has spent all morning collecting. They are for the stone built fire/cooking  stove area in the middle of the Long House.She will need to rest now and scratch her prickly scalp, we did use it to sand some of the wood, but she was very understanding. Benny our beautiful scout was very poorly after her battle with the Chemo Tribe, she contracted an awful infection from the tip of one of their spears.Websister placed her on Diamond her trusty steed, climbed on behind her and held her gently as they travelled to the next settlement the Hospital Tribe.Hope they both return to us soon as we miss them. Liefie is baking something that smells delicious for our evening meal, she wont let anyone help as it is an old family recipe. She has been given less strenuous tasks until her energy levels return. Near the wooded area below the house two ladies Traii and Bevlee ( who speak a strange language ) are standing on their heads, they say it makes them feel nearer to their homeland ? They have been so busy building a Dunny and a BBQ  we havent a clue what one is but they say it is essential. A BBQ we could do without so it must be the Dunny ? Bearcub who is the wise woman of the tribe is giving advice on sore scalps to Edi, Dakota and Traii. She assures us that this too will soon be a distant memory.  Jennie has returned from her third encounter with the Chemos, Edi Dakota and Traii their second. They are weary and need to eat and rest on beds made from soft leaves placed so the warmth from the fire helps them. Carlands has ventured down the path to recovery and is becoming stronger and more positive every day. Joanne sits quietly on a large rock by the stream with her toes in the water she is deep in thought. Penny for them Jo. The sun is setting over our valley and we have all had a long tiring day. Hope as it rises  so do our spirits. Blessings on all Warriors and the new ones heading down the woodland paths to join us.",

Got to 11.11 am and not even a puff !! Wish these morons who fortell all this would just do one !! i.e. chuck themselves off a mountain or something lol.Now will have to do the shopping I put off just in case ha ha.

Anyway some silly bxxxxxs are still waiting for alien space ships to come and rescue them ! GET A LIFE. Rant over :-)) Then I climbed into loft and found some extra xmas decs and the Nativity Set, so baby cheeses will soon be set in place by smallest GD. Best time of the year. Benny, Hope you are still SE free.Cramps could be constipation as Dakota says, I eat an orange or tangerine every night and that cured it. Pain WAS really nasty. Traii,Have you finished all shopping ? Hope your poor hands improve soon. bet DS is besides himself with excitment. Websister, lovely news about your Mum, she will be mobile again before you know it. Dakota, Glad you ok, you are right about little ones making the most of them before they stop believing in Santa. Got Santa suit out of loft for DH, he moans like hell but loves to see their little faces when he stomps in with their presents. Bevlee, have things improved re your disasters ? Hope SE's minimal.

When I worked as a waitress the one thing I always invested in was really comfy shoes. You must walk miles with the children.Girls bought me one of those vibating foot baths, now that is heaven soothes away all the pains. Will let you know if her Madge invites GD in for a cuppa. Many years ago someone we knew was working on the Queen Mothers home painting the outside. The door opened and she invited all the workmen in for a cup of tea, then proceeded to get out photo albums of the family to show them. They said she was just like anyone's Nan. Can't see that happening these days   x",

Traii, lol the spices worked, don't know how but pipes not half as bad today   I have just got up after 10 hrs sleep !! Road drill went to work 5 hrs ago and it was sooo quiet. Miss him but not the racket. I have had a shot so they must be  going to carry on with them before CMF don't mind if it stops any delays. Great your bloods stayed good. Fancy you ending up on here, even in work youcan't escape us. Feel a bit more chipper today, when DH comes home we are hitting the supermarket, then looking for wallpaper for our bedroom. GD came in the end last night she loves the little hat and looks as cute as a button in it. Hope you have had a good day x Carla, ((( Hug ))) sure you need one x Caitlin,Get  those pockets ready for Friday, my steroids were via iv too, great you and Carla on this part together, much less scarey if you can compare experiences.You will both be great. x Nihahi, What a magical day you had, I really enjoyed it ! You are going to be so fit that you will hurtle through next part. x going to shut up now for a while as face needs make over before I face the world. Love you all xxxxx",

Sounds good and hope it works out to be the best for you x Websister, sleep machine lol bet my DH would be the only one on earth it wouldn't work on. They are saying snow on way here at weekend and temps of -14 deg !! We are doomed lol. You are a great mum too, don't think we ever give up supporting our little ones even when they turn into great big ones x Luvmy. Scones sound yum, let me know how they go with the buttermilk. I get lost on here if lots to keep up with, so have pad and pen and write down alongside each sister anything to post back. Still get a bit mixed up but saves scrolling back over 2-3 pages. x Benny, Gosh you sound more like our Benny, glad you are getting lots of info. I made semolina last night in the microwave, sweetner not sugar added after cooking or I popped in a small spoonful of sugar free strawberry spread, yum and slid down these pipes good style.Risotto meals are now a staple diet here, mainly veg and also so soft and creamy. Di is an angel behaving so beautifully for her Mum, sure she knows that you needed her to be good. Lisa baldy birds is on f/b on her 2 yr old who the day before had jumped every jump on the Grand National course, ridden by her friend of course. Lisa can ride but only gentle walks at the moment. Did you manage the egg custard ? GD going to London tomorrow, her mum came but forgot to ask her photo info. I followed your instructions but all that posts is a red x and a square as if a pic is there but nothing comes up. Keep your chin up x Traii. trolley story tickled me, my DH did the same when GD's were little, I would be staggering up the aisle with armfuls of shopping and he would be spinning little one who was shreiking with delight at the other end. It is hot hot hot where you are, glad you got you groceries. We got ours but I had a nasty funny turn, felt sick and panicky so came home before wallpaper shopping. Think we are looking for a Terracota or warm peach this time to brighten room up. I have finally given in and admitted I don't feel 100 percent so DH is in his element waiting on me hand and foot. Should be back to \"normal\" after weekend so just enjoying it. Nihahi, bearcub and anyone else love you and am thinking of you. Worried about Bevlee, anyone any idea if she is in bad area ?",

Then tin of chopped tomatoes, garlic if liked and slice  mushrooms or little button ones left whole.( Bit of red wine if not for little ones. ) simmer on low heat about half an hour. Or you can buy various bolognaise sauces in jars which you just lash in after onion and mince. I like to thicken the sauce with a little cornflour and water mix but up to you. Cook some dried spaghetti or fresh if preferred. Drain spaghetti put in pasta dishes, meat sauce on top sprinkle with parmesan or I prefer just crumbly white cheese and serve. Garlic bread lovely with this too. our kids loved it and still do now. (You can add chopped peppers for colour and extra veg if you wish )x",

Benny, I am proud of you, as are we all, you have turned around your mind set and I know you will keep it up. When you meditate, ( great idea ) place your hands palms upwards and slightly cupped to receive energy from the universe.

Stream on the right, walk towards the stream and then sit on a large flat stone at the head of the stream, feet in the water face to the sun. To your left the stream falls away to a poweful waterfall, take all you pain, apprehension, and uncertainty and throw into this waterfall and watch them get carried away. Lay down on the warm stone and rest. Find this one really helpful. Feel some empathy to know my chemo was of the same family as yours, as it causes the pain from hell, red devil very apt for you. Please eat as meds defo no good on emprty tum. You are in control now, fight brave warrior. x Websister, you are really amazing. The fact mine is part of the red devil family has actually made me feel better. Now I know it is not something I am or am not doing that makes everything burn.

His first grandchild is due in two weeks, at one time he never thought he would live to see that day..  His Mantra is \" I'm not going anywhere \" and I agree with him. Needless to say we are all thrilled to bits for him. They did a great job and laughed all day, no one fell off, or hit fingers with hammer. I kept them supplied with food and hot drinks.",

They call themselves Shed Men now lol. bearcub, hope snow not too deep. All gone here thank goodness, Luvmy, the lads did have such fun and have spent today talking about going into business. They worked so well together. Websister, Hope Mum settled? and your son's mouth much better. Jennie ,you are right we all need to hear stories of how things will be in the future. Can't wait to be one of the people posting how one day it will all be a distant memory because I am out the other side. Scottie, all the excercise talk makes me feel sooo guilty but still don't get up and do any. Running out of excuses. ED is running in a few weeks for BC research so really feel bad when I hear how hard she is training. Jmeevans, Welcome, in your pocket tomorrow. onwards and upwards. you can do it. Kim, Googling mooseballs ? bet that was a fun packed experience lol. Dakota, hope you now relaxing. I am now utterly pooped ! Why do women at baby showers feel the need to go on about the pain of childbirth, sleepless nights, and how the next eighteen years are hell ? Poor girl looked as if she wished she could turn the clock back.To top the lot during a pin the dummy on the baby game Edi removes the blindfold and off flies the flipping wig, mortified lol night all xx",

Glad your beautiful boy had fun, where do they get their energy from ? Wish it could be bottled and I would buy a crate full. kim, like nihahi, the meatballs would have sent me into hysterics, the expression on your face must have been priceless lol. Can't wait for Benny to come back, you and her will have such fun comparing horse stories. Re name suggestion Warrior sums up everyhing she is and you are ,Benny got her Diamond a wonderful saddle pad in the most amazing colours. When she looked up the meaning of the patterns it was all about fighting, healing etc. Will try and find the page with pics etc for you. Bearcub, I agree with you as empty nester too. Loved every minute ( almost ) of being a Mum, it was just one girl was really quite nasty and the mum to be did look quite scared. This was her best friend too ! When wig shot off I just bent down picked it up, shook it, pulled it back on and prayed it was on straight . No one said a word and the game continued. Could have been worse could have split my pants when I bent down to pick it up.lol How's your hair coming on ? Liefie, glad Alberta good for you.Shortribs DO sound lovely not sure about the Bison part ? Nihahi, LOVE LOVE LOVE, the way you compared birth of baby and new boob. So perfect a comparison. We women have to go through these things but at least your new boob won't eat you out of house and home, give cheek, and want to borrow the car. Small compensation Benny, you are in our hearts and thoughts every single day. Hope you are back with all your latest experiences very soon X Carla Bevlee and all sisters take care of yourselves. X",

I was on a cruise from 19th December-5th Jan. 🚢 . DH is neurotic about putting info like that on the internet so couldn't send my wishes before. 😭 Thought about each and everyone of you, especially at midnight on the 31st. We have all come such a long way on a really long and hard journey. Wonderful that we are still here. Personally don't think I would have got here without you amazing Warrior Sisters supporting me through the treatment and se's. For that I thank you. 😘 So many of us are on Facebook and it too is a more light hearted support, lovely to see who is up to what. Weather in far away places and beautiful photos. \"In Shock\" will always hold a special place in my heart. Morwenna, hope you are recovering quickly. Jackpot, you too, didn't know about transfusions problem either. Will keep popping back here. ",

Going to pinch alco free wine idea when mine happens. Read somewhere on this site that as one lady had the last one they ring a big bell ! What a lovely idea too. How the se's ? Dakota, if we do come back to this earth a second time around, will you be my Mum please ? Your little ones will never forget how you still got there whilst going through this. Nihahi, Toe noooo, that is defo a pain to rival the alien. Bought a new pack of frozen peas ( to eat ) the other day and thought of you, always will from now on lol. liefie,little one in nappies, what lovely memories, sigh. When I look at my boy who is built like a brick outhouse I really can't believe how fast the time has gone. Thinking of you tomorrow with the tear duct op. Your DH will have to tie you to the bedhead to keep you resting for three days. he he, now wait for nihahi to read that bit . DH can do the cooking too that should be interesting to see what bits he makes into a delicious dinner for you. You are right about men being strange, mine does same thing Not the bedhead lol, the food. Carla, this is a long one and if I lose it will throw this netbook across the room! Happy bday to your baby boy. My baby girl is 37 this Saturday, we still refer to her as \" the baby \". You ARE getting there and being so posiitive. Nihahi is right sooo glad we found each other on here. Traii, 3 am so not nice and the fan adds insult to injury. I was dancing away whilst blitzing wardrobes 5 pm yesterday stuff piled everywhere between me and door then OH OH same thing happened to me ! Picture this 65 year old leaping over boxes and bags like a flippin racehorse to get out the door to the loo. As soon as I sat down the phone rings, then the mobile, both of which I had run past on my way, I usually grab them on way to bathroom as if DH rings and doesnt get an answer he thinks I am lying unconcious or worse somewhere. As you know can be there for a while lol. Last of my pills today too. Feet on DH good idea, I have elec blanket my side as DH can't stand them. When really cold I feel these big feet sneaking across. Bearcub, hair fantastic !! I wouldn't be wearing hat either, you got it girl, flaunt it, bit of makeup pair of earrings very glam !! I happily went out like that when first had mine buzzed and had so many compliments. Sorry to hear about bloods, hope they pick up soon. Lesleyanne, you will be snowshoeing before you know it. You have been through so much and are amazing. Ok now have to start on the last of these pills then porridge yay ! Love to you ALL.",

We had a comfy booth with little TV in to keep GD's amused. Great food and NO booze honest ! Real fun girly time, of course they need to go to loo every five minutes, Nana tags along to make sure they are ok. In they go, loo flushes out they come, hands washed thoroughly then blow dried. They love this routine and so proud of them, real grown up ladies now lol. I made a plate of choc chip cup cakes with candle in middle one and much singing of Happy B/day to you ensued. Later I had youngest GD for a few hours while her Mum went to Liverpool She came to supermarket with me, insists on pushing trolley and then carefully picks any fruit and veg etc for me. Takes everything out of trolley to put on belt then puts it all back at the end. Lovely elderly couple watched her and said they wished they had a little one just like her. God is good and I am blessed. All decorating of bedroom done ! joy to wake up this morning with what I call the BC wallpaper gone. I used to stare at the flippin stuff when out of my mind with worry when all this started. Carpet, new bed etc week after next as bathroom being started tomorrow and too many people in my tiny house otherwise lol. Liefie, hope your eye nearly back to normal. Dakota, would never even think of mentioning this on f/b don't worry.Hope you are seeing that lawyer whilst that bxxxxxd is hopefully getting sunstroke in Florida. Would love to see his face when you tell him you are moving on. Two new wigs ! you are worse than me, I will miss the choice every morning when hair comes back lol. Looked in mirrir last night and it is defo growing, about an eigth of an inch, but all over and hard to see as snow white. Scottie, Sure your son will be fine but thoughts are with you.Advice on DIL so true, that is why I haven't given her the Glasgow kiss ( headbutt ) the bxxxh would stop us seeing the kids I realise that. One day I am afraid that I will let go, but softly softly catchy monkey right now. 46and single, 9 weeks will fly by, things in your body will just stay the same. If they had the slightest doubt you would be in there now. Just spend the time building your strength. Getting everything in the house organised so you can rest and look after yourself then. Adagio, Well done !! the girls on her know their stuff, make the most of the steroid high and rest when you can, hope minimal se's for you. Nihahi or stir fry lol. Balloon pics gorgeous< my dh had a flight in one for his 50th and still raves about it. Shame we can' put Dakota's not DH and your Alien in one and take away the let the air out and come back down part. DH does know all about DIL but like me treads softly. She has been know to actually hit my boy. sob, and is sooo irrational I fear for his safety if we antagonize her. Hope Alien nicely chiled. Websister, hope visit with Mum goes well.Rads on 21st getting there ! Traii,Water fights are such fun, GD's adore the hose if and when we get any heat here. I have a large plastic mat with holes in and when you attach it to a hose sprays come up and they dance in the little fountains, pure joy to watch. Had a cake for you, you did enjoy it lol. My bros couldn't be here but we will get together again soon. No booze while on CMF, but soda water did the trick yesterday. Will finish before this flippin lot vanishes into cyber space. Love to all xxxx  ",

Emptied bathroom cupboard, just how many bottles of shower gel does a person need ? Going to list what is there and won't buy any until all gone. Had shower and got glammed up  as our lovely neighbour and his wife came for tea and cake. six hours later we were still chatting and laughing, it defo is the best tonic. Scottie, don't give up !! I watched  all my friends having what seemed like dozens of grandkids. Had just about given up the DS met the \"B\" and they had two in quick sucession. Four years later both daughters pregnant three weeks apart. Grandkids like buses, none then pow ! Just don't let your lads get their brides via a church magazine or the internet. So awful for your poor Mum and not seeing the grandkids. If my son ever left the \"B\" I know that would happen but as long as he was safe and happy again we would have to grin and bear it. He didn't marry until he was 31 how old are your lads ? Dakota, not DH and chemo great comparison i.e. Toxic. Hope all goes well with your plans. Stirfry, lol hope you are feeling better. Those  mountains must be really beautiful with the extra snow.Hope visit from daughter not too bad. Traii, you know me sooo well, about a gallon of tea swallowed today. Will have to cut down as from tomorrow, loo will be gone so will have to come downstairs and through to back of house to other one. May just put sleeping bag by the door saves a lot of running up and down. Hope bunny boy gave you a bit of peace today but very much doubt it. Like you I am a night owl but not as much now as get too tired to see the TV. DH fast asleep on settee, poor man's batteries have gone flat. Hot and windy doesnt sound too much fun, been like a spring day here. Not too cold and really sunny. I have solar lights all over the back garden and they are twinkling like little stars. Adagio, hope you are feeling ok. Gonna hit the hay as eyes crossing with tiredness, see you all tomorrow, xx",

Here some ladies here even go to the supermarket in theirs lol. Also young ones wear their huge hair rollers too.When shopping with GD Saturday lady in front of me had on some really pretty pj pants underneath her coat but even tho I love mine, have to at least change into real clothes to shop lol. Spot on about of wonderful Dakota, she has emerged as a beautiful brave butterfly, her not DH on the otherhand is beyond a description  maybe cockroach ? Sooo jealous of  the girls your boys have, all we wanted for him was a normal happy life. She was only the second girl he had ever been out with. His first girl was with him for a good few  years but got fed up waiting for him to commit, think he panicked when years went by then he saw DIL in church mag. Contacted her and she had him up the aisle like a rocket. Would love to do an owl cake for little one, wish you were nearer. Liefie, hope eye all back to normal ? Nihahi, hope alien abated somewhat. Have to hop off as DH stomping up and down, plumber here ripping out bathroom and typical DH twittering about fussing fit to spit. See you all later xxx",

BC has no concience and just hits. The warrior sisters will push, pull, and ((HUG)) you through. The shock WILL subside but just go with the flow right now. Come on and post anything, get it out there x Foxey, same to you, sorry about asking were you finished eyes really tired and didnt read your post properly. I am 66 this year and just glad I got to this age in one piece.did the \"what have I done \"bit but BC doesnt care, hits where the Bxxxh feels like. I toyed with the idea of just heading for the exit after the lumpectomy, especially when they said 8 chemo then 25 rads !! Then took a deep breath, found the sisters and got stuck in. None of it is particularly pleasant but it IS bearable and the months fly by.  You look at the youngsters on here with their busy lives and little ones to look after laughing about hair and nails flying off, they are a shining example to us all. (((HUG))) x Nihahi, you trouble I don't think so lol. Sorry Alien off again I do give a rye smile when taking out the frozen peas for my risotto's. Sorry yours not success, think the amount of hot stock makes the difference will pm you one that doesnt fail for me. Mountains may be a no no go to the meadow instead< we can have a picnic by the stream maybe meatballs and spaghetti ??  So dreading tomorrow, wrinkly butt may be sorry he ever came thru our door. DH is lovely but he HAS to find fault with everything and I mean everything lol On the other hand bet he will be  really sweet and chatty to them instead, just me who got it in the neck instead. Pray for me xx Traii, nihahi beat me to the garage, what a lovely wifey you are DH hates smell of polish too. When the moaning starts I just say beats some of the smells that issue from you dear and carry on lol. Hope bloods ok, Kindy is just germ city but you have to see what DS has done because you are his lovely Mum. My two daughters coming for lunch today while DH at work. It will be hectic but soooo looking forward to the laughter. Just get those germs exterminated. Is this your last one this week ? x Dakota, thinking of you  (( HUG )) x Sheryl B  (( HUG )) x Benny, ok sisters starting to panic about you again. quick post PLEASE x Carla, Caitlin, hope you are looking after yourselves. x Bearcub, lesleyanne you too xx",

Hope twsnbn iced nicely, ED and I are having a taster class of BELLY DANCING   on Thursday night. Pelvic floor needs help from somewhere.Also looking into trying a Glee type choir which has started up near here. Comet due to be seen here tonight after sunset have set my mobile alarm to try and see it, after all might not be around in a few million years to see it then lol.

Mug of tea calling so came downstairs. As you come into lounge we have a side light Edi leans forward to switch it on forgetting i have half a glass of water in crook of my arm. Splashing noise ensues, look down to see his mobile phone and spare change floating around on the side table. Oh SxxT panic stations, wrap phone in kitchen towel, mop water off table, dry coins and put notes on radiator, they are now dry but a bit curly. Everything replaced as if nothing ever happened, good job I watch criminal minds lol. Phone working too. Thought of your DH in your kitchen making my little bit of hair stand on end. Get a roll of sticky labels and put them on edge of shelves or inside cupboard doors. Better still photo contents of cupboards and stick pics inside doors. Did this with dishwasher when I went away on cruise with my bessie friend. Just wish I had done it on everywhere else. When we did the bedroom I put masking tape labels above each set of his clothes, ie short sleeve tops, shirts, sweaters etc it WORKED now he puts everything back under right label and can find everything without the \" Wheres me shirt ? \" line. Your DD is just being comfy with Mom and Dad just close the door on her room.  I rememer ED's room when she lived at home !!!! she would just step over piles of clothes, clean and dirty eewww, to get to her bed. One day didn't have time to put clean bedding on her bed so left it in neat pile at foot of bed. Next morning looked in to wake her and she was sleeping on the bare mattress and pillow with uncovered duvet over her. Now she has her own place only tiny bit better but house full of love and laughter, maybe when remo done she will become all neat and tidy. My DH does the piles on cupboards bit too, followed by the \" Why do we need so many mugs, dishes, tupperware \" lecture. His shed is stuffed to roof with a million useless ( to me ) things and I keep quiet, also any spare cupboards full of drills screws etc.Tongue biting time. Got blonde GD today as Mom Dad and her moving into other Nana's, she has dormer bungalow with spare rooms so they are going to live there for next six weeks or so to get away from dust. Think I will take my own advice and get GD to help me label cupboards for when Papa does the crashing around kitchen bit.x Liefie, replied re skype on pm. MEN !!! think they pass tips onto each other on how to freak us out.x Where are all fellow warrior sisters ? xx Laters xx",

So love each and everyone of you xxxx woke at 3am then got up at 4am impossible to sleep think must be steroids ?? On sixth mug of tea, it is supposed to be good for you honestly Rads at 11.50 hope in a way they are running really late again as so don.t want to be at home. DH twittered on about the shower door ALL EVENING. !! For goodness sake accidents happen, thanks for the comment about easily shattered doors Nihahi, will tell him. Seems when it happened DH was helping young plumber put all of stuff into van for tip. Wrinkly butt I think should have had help carrying it, when DH came in and found glass everywhere and wrinkly out on the deck head in hands on the balustrade crying !! It was only £ 150.00 not a million and he is replacing whole thing if new door not right one. The poor man is undergoing more tests for cancer    he was clear for bowel but now tummy being looked at. Can't believe how horrid DH being. Didn't have the strength to argue last night but DH could be in big sxxt today if he starts again. When he thought he may have bowel cancer ( he didnt ) he was like a freakin zombie for months, short memory ? Liefie, think i missed some pages on here, your DS getting married on my birthday !! Wish I could send her one of my wedding cakes. That poor lady with the melting cake, my heart goes out to her. Someone asked me to do one covered in chocolate with chocolate roses once I said nooo chance as it was stinking hot here  ( for once ) and they were in a marquee which was like a sauna. They are the one cake I dread going wrong. Love the blouse and iron story lol.x Nihahi, Gosh you have a lot on your plate dear friend right now. Hope DD is improving iron count, pre diabetic is a pain, understand her diet will be good but does she drink lots of sweet drinks or secretly eat lots of choc bars, my son is on the autistic spectrum and used to find loads of wrappers under his bed. He now is morbidly obese and I keep waiting for him to be diabetic as it runs in family. He eats when he can't cope and being married to the bride from hell doesnt help lol. Why no coffee pre surgery ?? If they ever stopped my tea Edi would be in bits.x Caitlin, missed page with your post on. Where do you live aka no easter ? Hope no ring of fire for you mine due tomorrow so immodium at the ready. So sad about MIL, hope DH can spend some quality time with her. Hope next round treats you ok. (((hug ))).x Jennie, how are rads going, loving every minute of mine, there is a shortage of dishy men but the girls are a scream and love to make you laugh as they poke prod and draw all over your poor boob.x Traii, bet you can't wait for Sunday. DS must be besides himself with excitement. This is what you need to get your strength back. Any letter re op yet ? x Movie, will visit like a shot ha ha. We could defo do the wedding business on a global scale. We could have a private jet and fly around collecting any of the sisters who want to join in then charge zillions. lol x Bingo tonight yay went shopping with GD day before yesterday. She was adorable. We parked up, get out of the car. I will pull your trolley bag nana, lasted 5 mins lol. Stayed by my side like she was glued asked for nothing    we shared a macdonalds then re -hit shops needless to say nana now skint can't resist spoiling her.

      "Content": "Apr 4, 2013 12:10PM - edited Apr 4, 2013 12:14PM by scouser47 Hey everybody  you lot could talk the hind legs off a donkey, these posts have just made a lovely day even better, Had usual visit from Johny, 6am 7am 8am 9am was due to get to hospital 10am so Immodium was taken, oh I LOVE that stuff, like a flippin junkie with my stash. lol Got me through rest of day, went early to hospital as my lovely cousins wife is having chemo too, her app was running late so we had coffee ( sorry nihahi ) and a chat, She went for her chemo Edi goes to be cooked had to pick up neulasta from chemo dept. Barb still there so invited me for lunch !! Rang DH who was due back into work in about an hour, off you go says he ,and off I went.Her friend Helen who was with Barb has survived two cancers, endemetriosis and ovarian. They found the ovarian one when they operated for the other one. She now has a long blonde mop of hair and looks flippin amazing. Went to hell and back but now looks and feels great. Went to supermarket, got petrol for all those trips to hospital came home logged on and pow lol. Some good news, spare door has been found and will hopefully be ok. Supplier giving it free of charge  arent people lovely ? Wrinkly butt hopefully doing it tomorrow. DH will be at work I hope so I will be extra nice to the poor plumber. Traii, Just told DH about what your SIL said re shower doors, that shut him up.You get icing that trapped nerve, you must be fit and well for penguin island. Last chemo 23 then 30th of this month for second part. Rads finish 23rd so won't know what to do with myself every day. Won't miss the treatment but will miss the angels at the hospital. Johny freakin Cash wasn't really that bad this time and at least the bugger turns up at regular intervals. LOVE the plant story soo much sounds like my DH he pulls up good plants and leaves the weeds tho. lol. You rest and get that wrinkly butt pain free xx Jackie, you poor love, fun having DD home but must be knackering, sure when she adjusts to US time she will be more laid back. You defo wed organiser and nice white jet would be lovely lol. Rest well and recharge, Namaste xx Nihahi, AARRGGHH for you, must be meeting yourself coming back !! Locker for DD is priceless    still if it saves your condo from resembling a bomb site let DH do it. DH has calmed down a bit but as you say it is just a feckin shower door !! Makes a drama out of every crisis but like you havent the strength or inclination to put up with all this cxxp. Food in freezer, wow pile of tins and an opener would be my answer you are a domestic goddess. Good cop, bad cop, must be in every family like you I get the sxxxxy end of the stick while lovely ???? Daddy hands out money and gives into them. If they said nooooo tea Edi would be a sobbing wreck, sure a little coffe isn't going to do much harm.xx Liefie, This Wedding business would be such fun if only in cyber land. Recipe for hummus please never tried it but sounds healthy. Reminds me of a friend who opened a packet of prawnd crackers ( uncooked ) dropped whole packet in pan and half filled the kitchen with them lol.xx Caitlin, Gosh thought everywhere shut for Easter. here they close for anything and everything therefore supermarket full of people buying up everything in sight as if food and drink will never be in shops again. Good luck with round 5 in pockets. So glad DH getting to see his Mom, and that you have lots of help and support. xx Websister, hope you feeling bit brighter, glad Birthday was fun. Se's have subsided beautifully thanks, and love, love, love rads. So hope they are good for dear Benny too. Haven't ever heard of them being awful for anyone so heres hoping.xx Carla, in your pockets too for round 5, you are doing so well sure you will be great. The weight will fall off when things back to normal, more of you for GD to cuddle xx 6pm here and can't believe that I am actually HUNGRY, ate couple of crisps ( chips ) for the first time in months and could taste them and they didnt feel like razor blades going down, RESULT. Brought home half my ham salad sandwich as a doggie bag from lunchtime so gonna hoover that down with a pint or two of tea. All our sisters bless you and keep you safe and well, laters xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",

Had the BEST day since this sxxt started yesterday. DH went to work and Edi was up and running. Looked out at my garden/yard. Sun was shining !! went out onto deck and it was warm enough for no coat. . Started by scrubbing garden furiture and putting back in place. Swilled deck and then tidied DH's tool store. My carpet shampooer is a stupidly huge machine and no where big enough in house to store it. Now in there, bet DH moans but SO WHAT. He only opens the store now and again and now everything is neat and tidy. Collected all my garden bits and bobs, wind chimes etc and then with mask on ( that was a sight for sore eyes ) sprayed them all with chrome paint, plus stuff from shower room. All looks like new. Popped to shops as needed milk bread and something for roast today.( yum) Came home and GD and ED came to see me. Made GD dinner and then she announces she wants a bath here, in she goes and I go in our room to find ED testing new bed out. She is sleeping on a mattress on the floor at MIL and hurting all over. Dry and powder GD and pop into her pjs next thing both of them are cuddled up under duvet and threatening to never go.lol They are coming for a sleep over next Saturday which will be lovely. ED remo back on track but her partner is like DH and could find fault with anything, think it is a control issue. She is now looking forward and being positive for both of them. Today DH is off and hopefully if sun comes out is painting his shed. Edi will start tidying garden ready for hopefully planting bedding plants soon. Felt amazingly energetic and sooo hope it will last. Nihahi  poor DD, but just your luck to meet infected person, good for you getting out of there. Hope you both ok now xx maybe you should carry anti bac spray and squirt anyone who looks dodgy. Liefie,you poor lamb, hope you brightening up, will send you some of my energy and good feeling. 10 people for food !! but as you say will keep you busy and then food fun and laughter will lift your spirits. Put on some happy music as you do the prep and get dancing around you beautiful kitchen. Lots of ((( HUGS ))). Traii, bet your house is manic !! Safe journey xx All your sisters out there, happy Sunday, minimal se's and love and joy.xx",

Lovely lady slathered cream on hands and up to elbows, gentle massage then towels off excess. Same with feet. In the meantime we laughed our socks off because as you know Edi cant be well behaved. Seems I can have this every day !! so that is the next 9 days of pampering sorted. Went to supermarket for some goodies as my dear friend who is three years out was coming for lunch. Gorgeous, and I mean gorgeous gas fitter arrived and spent all day fitting new fire, plus realigning fire surround. His sister has BC and therefore I got a kiss and cuddle before he left  going to friend her on f/b and she is going to visit me on her next visit to merseyside as she lives in London. DH hovered over gas man like a black cloud I so wanted to kick his legs from under him !!! gasman very patient and is meeting DH for a pint at the weekend. Friends visit was pure joy. We compared scars and talked about our journey. Really interesting comparing stories. Sun is shining but wind would freeze meatballs of a moose. Seems we are due a heatwave June will not dig out t.shirts just yet. Traii posted pics on f/b and looks as if great fun being had especially by DS he is a beautiful boy. Liefie, you do sound much chirppier, glad u like the words saw it on f/b and had to copy and paste. I am not too bad at spelling but hated math with a vengeance. Still do. Passport for DS a pain in the butt, you are a lovely Mom Edi would just leave him at home lol As for paperwork I hate it, when I had my shop I would do  the paperwork once a year mad scatter doing it for accountant, instead of doing it weekly and saving myself sleepless nights. Hope you keep feeling better and better. xx Caitlin, Rads are WONDERFUL, 9 more for me !!. You too with paperwork think you ladies are sooo organised, Keep well dear friend xx Jennie, 3 down 2 to go, well done soon be there. Hamster very apt, or groundhog day.xx Dakota, brave girl Friday will be thinking of you ALL day. At least you will get some rest and looking after plus new boobs xx Nihahi, so wish you didn't have all this other sxxt to put up with  Hope shoulder is settled. Next week is your turn, feet up and let them all get on with it !! play the ill card for all it is worth. twcbn will be no more !! you too will be in my thoughts ALL day Friday.xx All sisters health peace and love xx Laters Edi.",

How can a day of fun and joy be turned into a slice of Hell ? Here we have London Marathon on Sunday panic stations now ensuing, also Mrs Thatchers massive funeral tomorrow. We are all going to hell in a handcart as my Dear Mom used to say. Prayers going out for all involved and the people of this beautiful city. All same old same old with Edi, good sleep and no naps during day yesterday.As footloose and fancy free whizzed off to shops again for a good mooch. Bought lots of solar bits for my back garden/yard. Fell asleep after dinner and forgot to look and see if they had come on lol. Early rads today and then every day until the end, now then DH working again so fun fun fun day planned. Visited an old friend/neighbour   yesterday too, she is almost 20 years out from lung cancer. She was being treated for asthma for 12 months until her DH queried tests her GP sent her for further tests and it was so advanced it was too near vital organs to operate. They battered her with chemo for 12 months and she is fit as a fiddle. Felt really \"normal \" yesterday too, made liver and bacon in onion gravy with mash and savoury cabbage for dinner. I cleared my plate and enjoyed every mouthful, that too is a first. Liefie, DH's and joy when they go to work, you did answer your own question  always said I have four kids and know which one is the hardest work. Yours and the \"come and see flower made me smile.\" Mine does the littlest task and it is \"I have brushed the deck come and see\"  Think next time I clean the loo will drag him in for a view lol. Tiny babies and cuddles what joy, glad tiny one home. You really suit your hairstyle and me being a lazy lady always had mine short and spikey like an ancient hedgehog. Hoping for maybe some curls which my many friends who have had chemo seem to aquire.xx Dakota, how lovely that you had a day off, hope it was good. Keep well xx Traii, Thanks for heads up on Pokies, would never have guessed that one  did you win ? Baby and first period is sooo scarey it happened with my ED and I was convinced she was dying, thank goodness someone explained. I am dying this snow white/charcoal mix head asap. Seems we can't use chemical dye for 6 months as reacts with chemicals still in hair.Friend did it and went the colour of an orange !! Our health store does a vegetable based dye which is supposed to be ok.xx Nihahi, cuddles and big hugs flying to you xx Websister, lovely that you are galloping to the finish line. great news on levels.Don't think it will be long before I head out with no wigs or hats temperatures rising here so hoping it continues. Take care xx Caitlin, hope DH had a good visit with MIL and some hopeful news. Keep well xx DH had the nerve to get up same time as me !! getting daggers from him  so will log off for now, he has toothache and seems he has had it for two weeks, accounts for nasty temper. He is going to dentist this week if I have to drag him there. Love to ALL xx",

Sorry about fxxk it list yesterday but really yuk afternoon.So tired and boob throbbing. They gave me gel filled pads and these have worked. Had rads, went up for bloods as first part of last chemo today !! Flippin hand massager didnt show so had toast and coffee instead. Needed to kill almost an hour til reflex appointment, she lives right by hospital so not worth going home. Trotted out into sunshine and climbed into my little car, rolled up coat as pillow and had a lovely sleep. DH wakes me via mobile phone just in time for reflex. Lovely session, she is also a very dear friend and cuddled me while I sobbed my soul out. As she is also a survivor, understands me soooo well. Cam home and DH made me lunch, then splat Edi unconcious again. Woke in time to make dinner, made soda bread for first time, topped slices with Irish rarebit, same as welsh but with stout added. Puts it all on plate with fresh tomatoes gives to DH and he didn't like it !!! Something out of freezer or tin tonight lol After chemo at 10am today got 5 hrs until rad so DH is taking me for lunch ( or else !! ) making a day of it. He shocked my socks off yesterday, he has bought huge tins of gorgeous biscuits/cookies for the rad and chemo staff plus thank you cards from him to them for looking after me. I was going to do that anyway but he beat me to it. Movie, if you were a fly on my wall you would probably be painted over lol. DH is a busy little bee, but right now just wish he would go and play golf.He has given up on making his own water feature in the garden/yard found one on e.bay instead, less swearing and crashing about as all complete. wish you were nearer could send him to sort your yard. Thanks for cyber hug, needed that and one right back to you. xx Nihahi, you sound amazing glad rotten drains all gone, nothing like your own bed, No wonder you were in such pain with the rogue alien, so glad it has been sorted for you, hope you are able to sraighten up soon but, softly softly catchy monkey. Just enjoy being looked after. Defo edit photos no way you look that ancient lol. Annie Lennox look coming on so may hold off the dye.xx Traii, very last rad today, will miss the rad girls but not the whizzing up motorway everyday. Hope you are ok, any news re surgery ? xx Websister, thank you for your kind words. Hope you can fit Mom's bed in basement, I would love a basement better than climbing into loft to stash stuff. Your DH sounds lovely. xx Liefie, came up on skpe you were on line a few minutes ago, clicked on to call you amd you were gone, Good luck with planting, we too have four trays to go out, I have to be the one who chooses where each plant goes as DH can't ever decide.xx Dakota, hope you are ok xx All other sisters always in my thoughts xxxx",

Oils are wonderful and you will soon be able to afford the jet for wedding business lol. I had a sore and swollen hand after nurse missed vein my lovely Reiki/Aromotherapist made me a cream with lavender oil added and next day totally back to normal.

Like the sisters will all say you have joined a club NO ONE wants to be a member of. Even so logging on here is the best thing you can do. We know the icey fingers of fear that are now gripping your heart and soul, please as Jennie says keep away from Doctor Google. I did it and had myself dead and buried, 10 months later it has all been treated and my life is back to some normality. Remember one thing, we are ALL here to listen and hopefully make you smile now and then. It is a journey full of waiting ( the worst part ) for results etc, but once the path to follow is given to you, you will put one foot in front of the other and know that this band of Warrior sisters are all around you. You don't need to be brave on here,  everyone does it for the family and friends but we KNOW how it is, come on here and be angry, sad, or just rant, we understand. Do you have a breast cancer nurse yet ? Here in England we are given a nurse on diagnosis who we can ring and ask questions of anytime. Check out things like that and don't despair. Big (((HUG))) to you, keep that chin up and FIGHT the bc bxxxh. You WILL win. Edi (Scouser) xx",

Underwear all in large built in cupboard in corner of bedroom, he never thought to open the door. your DH  cant possibly be that hopeless.

Thinking of you and sending big (((HUG))) xx Sun shining AGAIN !! still need thermal vest though. DH jet washing front of house and driveway  bit of peace yay. Tons of laundry to do  Found all my oil painting stuff yesterday so getting back to painting this week, might start with pic of view of back garden/yard.

If I try to nap DH makes as much noise as is possible then moans if I fall asleep in the evening. Roasting hot here ! 90 deg tomorrow, GD's at birthday party tomorrow so that will be stressful.

Traii, you are amazing, those drains will soon be out and new girls taken for an airing, since rads I have one DD boob and the other one is about a C it has shrunk so much lop sided Lil that's me. Just enjoy the pampering you will miss it when you are back to normal. Alive, good advice from the girls, lots of fluid and rest.

Another step on the path. Hair will be back before you know it. Mine is really wavey and about two inches long. Wig gazes at me from its stand but I have it there for cooler days.

Glad youngsters got back safely. Benny, your pics are fabulous !! Love the pink mounting block, you clever girl. How did lesson on Diamond go ? Chicken will be fun and no one will notice just one, disguise it as a large pigeon. Movie, teeth problems are horrid hope you get sorted very soon. Nihahi, flood damage is dreadful !! Hope you find less damaged paths soon. Struggling with the new information re my BC and it has plunged me into a bit of a pit, wish I had trotted along not knowing. My nurse trying to get me more information sent out and says that they wouldn't have treated me if there wasn't a chance of recovery, she is wonderful and always there if I need her, must think I am a silly old woman  Went on forum for Triple Neg on here and to be honest  made me feel worse so back on here to cheer me up.

Now will have no excuse for forgetting from now on. Outing with shedman went txxs up I am afraid he was in hospital having tests as food lodging in pipe again  we were all worried that the tumour was causing it but no, his flippin stent has moved. Today being taken to Liverpool hospital for operation to try and retreive it. Saw him yesterday and he does look better, they have rehydrated him and can't believe the difference. Just praying op works. Lovely that you have found someone good to help re massage, had reflex and Reiki yesterday and do feel better for it.x Traii, is the other drain out yet chick ? How is DS x Websister, Bet being back to work knocks your socks off !! You are amazing. Hope you get appointment for massage soon. How is your little Princess and family x Mowenna, never had any se's from rads except being tired and dry skin. Please don't despair, you are nearly there, I cried at the end of it all as felt abandoned but it all subsides and life takes over as normality returns.Keep that chin up  x Movie, thinking of you and DD x Liefie, keep hearing Dolly Parton singing 9-5 when I think of you. Go girl !! you will be flying through the day before you know it. Prince William spent the night with his new family at the hospital. Champagne corks popping on the streets of London. World's press camped opposite for that first picture. x Marie, how you feeling ? x Dakota, you healing well ? Hope you are relaxing as much as you can x We have thunder and lightning here too !! Still humid though, garden will be grateful, grass yellow no matter what you do. Quick question, anyone had shooting pains in rad boob weeks after all finished. ?

Hadnt seen his family for many years as they had all moved away so didnt expect to be recognised but was hugged and kissed and recognised by them all. Service was really lovely, a celebration of a long and happy life.He was a cancer survivor of 25 years by the way. After we had a fabulous time remembering our childhood memories, laughed so much our sides ached, he was such a funny man with a dry sense of humour. Now back in touch with my lovely cousins via e.mail and face book . Then off to shedmans to carry on painting, ( DH not me ) his lovely wife cooked us a gorgeous pasta dish which we enjoyed al fresco, something which rarely happens in England lol. He ate all his meal plus ice cream  ! it was wonderful, at this rate he will soon have some weight back on. Nihahi, sure your help is appreciated but must feel like two steps forward and one step back with the weather. Hope conditions settle soon. x Liefie, hope you are having a lovely break and birthday, bet your bag is over flowing with tiny items too x Traii, are you enjoying the drain free experience ? is DS home again yet. x Dakota, how did the reveal go ? x Websister/Benny/Morwenna/Maria have a wonderful week end with lots of fun and no se's for those still having treatment.

Today the sun was cracking the flippin flags !! We did a long walk but actually too hot. Supposed to go back to white eagle for fresh caught fish and chips before setting off home. DH talks to man on our caravan site who convinces him to go elsewhere. It was HORRID !! I had soup YUK. DH also disliked his, he, he, served him right ! It was like a waiting room for hell honestly. Really stuffy and hot. If we had gone where we planned we could have sat out on the deck overlooking the beach He is sooo in the dog house. woof woof. Could any of you help me with a query, recently little fingers bit numb and tingling as the day goes on. Is this neuropathy ?? If so does it go eventually. Just seen on the news that a building I worked in as a young woman The Cunard Building is to be turned into check in for cruises from Liverpool. Hope you all going to have a good weekend. I am on a training day for my telephone BC buddy tomorrow, soooo excited. DH says anything and he will be sorry. Nice to go away but can't wait to get into my comfy bed tonight. X",

The great part is that we can give our opinions and advice and also chatter away like we are all having coffee together. BC isnt the only thing in our life even though at first it seems like it, all overwhelming and heavy. Then as we walk that path it lifts and as the se's ease there is light at the end. Last chemo ! what a milestone. I cried at mine  purely because I would miss all the wonderful people I had met there and their kindness and understanding. Rads are a walk in the park in comparison, going every week day the worst part but be kind to yourself. Play favourite music in the car on the way. Afterwards rest if you can and pamper yourself. lots of Aquacream or similar. Will be thinking of you today. Please call me Edi by the way Love that you are a doggie person, they are so wonderful and I swear they know what is going on in our bodies.X Adagio, I have my first annual check  up with surgeon on Monday and like you bit apprehensive. Will be thinking of you. x Maria, hope all going well re hubby's job ? plus the dentist appointment too. How lovely that you too are feeloing \" normal \" isn't it amazing ? Right through treatment we think we will feel yuk for ever, then it is as if someone waves a wand and things change My DH is freaked with the la di da bit too LOL. x Morwenna,Singing certainly made me feel liberated and made me breath better. Drumming circle sounds fantastic ! Sorry to hear about your Mum's heart problems. Back to work soon, I am jealous ! I miss the interaction with people. As DH has retired I daren't go back but if BC hadn't hit me I would have probably have continued waiting tables for ever. X Traii, forgot to put hope DH has negative results from mole. Poor love must be besides himself with worry. Glad my cyber baby heading into the \" normal \" zone too X Benny, glad you found a decent bra, will make a note of that for my BC telephone buddies as we are compiling a list of helpful things to get new ladies through everything. Got to riding school !! Going to book a lesson very soon. They were so lovely and on our local news last night they had a report about \" Galloping Grannies \" a lot of older ladies have started up and were raving about the health benefits on TV so here goes X Nihahi and Liefie, hope you have a glorious and wonderful day/night also anyone I haven't mentioned.

They are incredible, like the Linda Mc. My veins are knackered too  terrible trouble getting blood out last week. Veins like flippin concrete.X Morwenna, feel as sorry for yourself as you like we all understand X",

      "Content": "Dec 6, 2013 04:13AM - edited Dec 6, 2013 04:20AM by scouser47 Hi Deep sadness throughout the world today. R.I.P Mr Mandela. What an amazing man. The world has lost someone who taught us all so many lessons. Nihahi, your tree is magical  I love it, the ornaments are beautiful. I collect ornaments whilst on holiday and when I decorate my little memory tree in the back room each one makes me smile. Whilst in Bahrain many years ago DH myself, my cousins wife and her friend saw some lovely ornaments that were two for a Dinar or whatever the money was. I picked two and DH gave them to the stall holder. He looked so distressed and was pointing at us ladies and chattering away.My cousins wife told us it was because the man thought we were all DH's wives and should have bought three ornaments ( one each ) It seems that is the norm there  So if one gets a new car for instance they ALL get a new car.! She explained and the lovely man was then happy again.I will show GD your tree when she comes tomorrow she will love it. As Jackpot said can't believe our weather made news where you are ! Today it is 6 deg c so positively balmy compared to your part of the world. May have rain later but no wind thank goodness. That along with very high tides caused yesterday. Onesies ! that is a newish word here and they seem to be the favourite garment worn by young and old for lounging about in the house. Looked at one the other day then thought \" goodness Edi you would never get it off quick enough if the bathroom needed \"X Morwenna, glad your spirits have lifted. I was singing in the car yesterday too, told the lady who runs our choir about you and she was thrilled to hear about your gold medal win. We are small potatoes in comparison ,wish we would move like you do. Most are so ancient they would fall over . In my choir pic have a look at the lady in black on the front row and have a guess how old she is ? Good luck with your story.X Websister, thanks for your comments. Hope you got your story finished too and have a fab meeting. X Caitlin, Ferry cross the Mersey, WOW spent some happy times doing this. Like Jackpot not often enough despite being 10 mins away. Do you remember which part of Wirral you visited.? DH and I used to get on the Ferry in Liverpool where we were both born ,sail over to the Wirral and instead of getting off and paying we would hide from the crew until it went back to Liverpool. That was almost 50 years ago doubt you could get away with that now. We would do that a few times on a summer evening as we had no money or if we did we would get off and walk along the walk way in my picture. Hope those keys tun up in other house. I see them on a hook somewhere ??? X Adagio, 2 1/2 year olds love to decorate tree then when they arent around YOU do it properly ha ha. Such fun. X Jackpot, ((( HUGS ))) how many more chemo for you ? X Off to the shops for some draught excluder for old lady we help. She lives in an enormous house all on her own and the wind whistles in here and there so we are trying to get it better for the winter. X.ray on this darned hip too. Now walking with a limp, look like Long John flippin Silver. Laters Lovsya ALL X",

Cool and sunny here, Sunday usual boring day, Sainsbury's for groceries for healthy stuff. DH sticking to it ,so fingers crossed.I have one naughty thing a day, i.e one cookie but have given up coke ( drink honest ) sweetners except natural YUK.NO red meat and more veggies. Helping out at local charity shop in the morning ,so hope it livens me up GD is 7 tomorrow so all out for tea in New Brighton, her favourite place.She is out with her friend ( a boy ) and Mummy at local play place today.If we call him her boyfriend she goes off like a bottle of soda pop ha ha. Saw Jackpot last week she has had one week of rads.Only four to go Like Caitlin I am still in blind panic mode, every ache ,and there are many, I plan the funeral, then thanks to Jackpot have found a survivors thread which really helps. Shedman poorly again so we are going to try and see him later. Praying that weather improves for all of us and quick. Nihahi, so glad you have risen again, super that you get some dosh ( cash ) too. Bet they blamed the computer ? That is all they do here, soft sods couldn't organise a pxxs up in a brewery. Liefie, any luck with flippin skype yet,? sent you a video message a couple of days ago.

It was magical !! It is up a windy path that leads into a country garden, tables and chairs placed in little private sections. Pot of tea and home made scone and cake were out of this world. Just around the corner is the Mersey river, we sat on a bench and a tug boat went past he tooted and crew waved 😀 it was like being on holiday 😎.

Omega three fish oil seems to be the miracle cure plus hemp seed oil and selenium. Really glad charity shop work ended. More time and less hassle. Just working with people who need and appreciate help at the hospital. Have a public demo of scarf tying on Thursday at the hoital so will see if DH will sit for me while I practise my skills. 😄 We went to see\" Ultimate eagles\" last night, Eagles tribute band. They were excellent and to see loads of older people up dancing and smiling was a tonic. Sweet lady next to me was having a ball.Her hubby confided in mine that she was a 6 year BC survivor !! That made it all even better. Thinking of you all, love and hugs Edi X",

I was told I could have a little drink just not the WHOLE bottle of scotch , As if !! lol My darling boy told me once that he is saving to get out when the girls are older. One day he will have an inheritance from us and just hope it isnt too late for his sanity to be in tact. Thank you ,the girls are growing so fast and the only awful thing is that the eldest one who is ten, is like a clone of \"the bride from hell\" the younger one is a sweet loving soul just like my boy and to see them together is beautiful. DIL encourages the girls to criticise DS especially in front of me so I tell them how wonderful he is, but then look at his sad face and want to just gather him up and keep him safe. Hope he does what your brother did one day.I pray that I will live to see that day, what a party that will be YAY. Scottie, bet you are looking after your lads too well. They don't want to leave.Are you coming home this year, ? Eyes now like pee holes in  the snow but still can't sleep !!! How weird is that. Question, has anyone else had a feeling like there is a spot on the tip of their tongue ? There isn't anything there but feels like a zit about to erupt. Eating ok but everything still has the consistency of a flippin bath sponge. lol Gonna get me a mug of warm milk to bring on the ZZZZ's Love all you sisters XX",

How wonderful that you can liase with your DIL re your son's diet. my DS marieed the \"B\" the year of 9/11, as time went on his weight crept up. On one visit we were in the kitchen and I asked DIL if she could maybe encourage him to cut back on sweets,cookies etc ? She gave me the \"B\" glare and said \" IF YOU think I am putting my marriage at risk by telling my husband what he can and can't eat, you can think again \" My beautiful boy is now unrecognisable, he is morbidly obese. Has trouble walking, and when he sits in a chair, trouble getting out. Diabetes is genetic in my family and that was my one worry but now heart disease etc too. When they came the other day she too is now massive !! When they sit on the sofa the frame groans. When they stayed over once he sat on the edge of our old sofa bed and it snapped and bent. Thank goodness the GD's slim at moment. Hope your son listens to his caring wife and Mom, sure he will. I wait with dread for the phone call to tell me DS is either diabetic or in hospital .",

Had to laugh as she has feet that smell like pickled onions, no matter how often they are bathed. She giggled like mad, so did I. I am doing chemo and rads.

Glad your cousin is doing so well, as you say we are all different. Know what you mean about DH's and being outside. Wish mine had a greenhouse, he does love to potter in his shed and as he is madly redesigning our little palace the garden is next on the list. He has a little pond with a seven year old goldfish which looks like a koi carp ! When it goes to the big pond in the sky that is going to be made into a water feature. You MUST have that massage, my master does aromotherapy oil massages from head to foot. I haven't had one of these yet but bought one for a present for my Aunt and she said it was the best experience she had had in years. I too have 25 rads and quite looking forward to them as last step on this journey yay. Can't believe they charge for parking for Cancer patients. We have a blue card, wave it at man on gate and all free. Moviemaniac, Glad you still checking in  agree about nihahi wonderful description of bc diagnosis and will print it off, frame it and put it in my kitchen. When anyone pxxxxs me off will take them in there and point at it. Hope Bronchitus gets better quickly, it all adds insult to injury doesn't it. I too am not half as scared as I was when I came on here last August, was rigid with terror then and now totally laid back and positive thanks to the sisters. Join us in the meadow anytime. Namaste,  x Been awake since 4am so have done a facial and painted my nails. Chemo no 6 here I come. !! Will check u all later xxx",

No she said they just tell you to come back now and again for chat etc. Whoa, Edi thinks what if it hasn't worked ? Then calm down and think, they MUST know what they are doing they have been at it for years lol. They have just rolled out a fab new vehicle here. It is a fully fitted out chemo treatment room. They park it in a supermarket car park for the day and you can just chemo then retail if you feel up to it. No parking fees or looking for a space as huge retail park. while i was in the shower this morning ,the first lady to be treated there today was raving about it on the radio. They also can do your treatment at home. I really fancied that idea but DH wasn't happy about it. That is great if you don't drive and have to get transport to the hospital. Lovely today DH just dropped me off and went home to annoy the plumbers. I could talk about MY BC with MY DOC without interruptions. Sorry to sound ungrateful but a bit fed up with people hijacking my illness.lol. hope alien dormant xx",

Had to empty all of our bedroom into box room as back bedroom is plumbers work room. Finished by 8.30 am which was a good job as carpet fitter came early. Luckily I had cleaned floor with my steam mop. Carpet all fitted in ten minutes. Perfect. Room much warmer and quieter after laminate. Bathroom was going great but electrics a disaster. This house had an extension built before we moved in and they put an enormous steel girder in which means wiring can't go the way it should. Wrinkly butt will finish just the shower next week as he has too go to hospital for tube down the throat tomorrow. Poor man is worried sick. Bed coming tomorrow so sleeping in \" sun \" room ha ha tonight again as other beds are in a heap. Felt good until about 11 am then think steroids wore off, so weak and tearful and DH seems to expect me to carry on as if ok. Why do they do that ? If he feels out of sorts the world grinds to a halt. GD coming for tea after school. I need her to stop me murdering DH. When rooms sorted over the weekend, that will be it for a little while. App came for mapping and tat for Rads this morning. Having all that straight after second part of CMF next Tuesday. First day of spring 21st March here, still really chilly but sun is shining.That is my Mum's birthday so must go and tidy her resting place and have a good talk to her. Still oiling arm and it certainly helps. My girls got me using it after it sorted their stretch marks. It is sooo gentle and smells divine.Sure it will help you and the girls. Will come back later after GD fone and dinner eaten. xxxx",

Got up 6.16 and had a good read of these posts ( best part of my day ) alternate between laughter and tears what a tonic you are. !! Had a pleasant day yesterday, no workmen in the house helped. Gas man, after being cancelled rang DH and got all \" you must have this done or we won't cover the rest of your contract \" DH said fine, I will cancel the contract and find someone else if you don't come and clean the part of the boiler that is causing the problem. Gas man says NO phone goes down. Five minutes later Gas back on, we will be there tomorrow ( now today ) and do what you want !! DH not usually that assertive but his wallet was under attack and not for anything he wanted. Dreading it really as the man gives me the creeps, makes my hair, all half an inch stand on end. Wrinkly butt popping in to fit bath screen so sure he will help if gas gets bolshie lol. I then collected my GD from school and thus started the best part of the day. We came home for dinner and I was keeping her for a good few hours as Mum and Dad had an architect coming re house remodel. She wanted a bath but no hot water so Nana said would you like a shower with me ? YAY was the reply. In we hop together and we hose each other down scrub ourselves then hosing again. Nana then gets her \" hair \" washed thoroughly to many giggles. We agreed that we have the same bodies only Nana's much bigger and she doesn't have a blue boob. Wrapped in warm towels with mug of milky tea, Pjs on and she hoovers down a meal I couldnt manage. We then watched a DVD of her Grandad's 50th 16 years ago. The look on her face seeing her Mummy with a mop of hair like an exploded mattress was priceless.She was fascinated. We are at ED's for Mothers Day on Sunday so can't wait to show her too. The dvd's were transferred from old videos and it is lovely to see happy memories. Traii, Muc is horrible isn't it ? no wonder Benny was sooo fed up. Won't miss this se at all. C cup is a perfect size, so excited for you. Did sleep six hours again steroids seem to be gone within 24 hrs. Hope you got some rest with the starfish and DH hogging the bed. Your Dinner time if my calcs are right ? Have a lovely evening. x dakota, understand where you are coming from with the loss of your dreams, but you are such a strong beautiful woman your Prince will be out there when cockroach is crushed. Meanwhile you have to heal your spirit and get back to full health, x Nihahi, More snow, England would have ground to a halt by now lol. Thanks for the compliment, look at other old farts when out and about and must admit don't look quite as bad as some of them. Like Traii I really hate what Alien is doing to you. Countdown to destruction YAY X Movie< nihahi is correct, you too have been to hell and back. we all do this journey in different ways but Warrior Sisters All.x Liefie, Trip sounds wonderful, have the best time ever. Hope DH calms down, mine does that on holiday gets up for walks at dawn etc. In Spain many years ago he did that and a Dog came up and licked him, he dashed back convinced he had Rabies, that cured him x Large A small B ? as you say anything is better than two fried eggs lol. After I had my lumpectomy went for tea where I worked. Ordered egg and chips ( fries ) out the plate came with pile of fries and two eggs side by side, one smaller than the other. My boss did it to make me laugh, and it did x Carla, six cycles instead of four sounds good. Hope you are coping well x Caitlin, Round three wow bashing through this. Lovely DH and Mum there for you. Wig is gorgeous.You can be a fly on my wall anytime lol.x Luvmy, you ok ? Give the goats a curry that might move things on x Benny in our hearts and thoughts x Scottie, glad you ok, when you retiring ? You deserve some rest. Hope monitor happens soon for DS x Websister, fifty shades of pink much nicer, only ONE Joe, put in a complaint ! x Well have probably bored you all sxxxxxxs apologies all have fun packed day/night with NO se,s Love in buckets xxx    ",

Belly dancing tomorrow night if can stay awake that long. Bingo tonight.yippee. Grizzly bears !!! be careful and hang up thoses snowshoes you are too precious to be chomped by one of them. I am convinced that one may be my DH in disguise, he is on spring leave for 21 days heaven help me. Need to put foot down or I will need a lie down in a darkened room he has sooo much planned. Sleep well x Traii, Cyber Mummy sad that you are not feeling great. Hope those tummy noises don't result in Johny Cash. We have the funeral of that friend of my kids today   post mortem showed he had a massive heart attack. His lovely Mum is devestated and now almost destitute. He was Bi Polar and his benefits kept them going after their business failed and his Dad also died suddenly. Now all money stopped.There is always someone out there far worse than us isn't there ? You will bounce through your op I just know it   your DS is such a sweetie i am sure he will know you need to get better and maybe cant hurtle around after him. your lovely Mum Dad and DH will also be there for you. We are having GD for sleepover Saturday and she said to DH that she knows Nana not too good so will be extra good. When all this finished I too want a little break somewhere away maybe Scotland. Hope your little hol is wonderful.x Liefie, You sound like you are in paradise, keep on having a relaxing time and watching your Bunny doing his thing x Need MORE tea and maybe some cornflakes with hot milk for a change. Love to ALL see you later xxxxxxxxxxxxxx",

I am sodding worn out  DH was on a mission, we dashed from place to place for four hours. Holy sxxt I wanted to push him under a bus !! It's like he never listens to me when I start to flag a bit, just charges from place to place with me staggering along behind him. Came home and zonked out for half an hour on sofa, bliss. Phone went and his mate woke me up. Then turned up for a cuppa. Lucky he wasn't wearing it.lol. Put tea in oven, came in to tell him it was almost ready, he was snoring ! had the greatest of pleasure pinching him to wake up and eat. Payback time. Belly dancing didn't happen as ED has nasty cold just as well really. Maybe next week if both of us are well enough. Have a lovely day, hugs xxx",

Even tho under your tee shirt is now pain and more pain you find time to comfort us newbees and kick ass when needed. Don't EVER apologise for words used on here, one thin g about BC it makes me swear like a docker lol. I dropped something in the kitchen this morning and the word \" Shit \" followed, little voice from GD pipes up\" Papa Nana just said Shit,\" mortified  ( not )  When she was a tiddler in the baby seat in back of car DH had to slam on due to some gonk going wrong way, he beeped and tiny voice says \" What the fxxk was that ? \" we were helpless. Turns out her Mom had said just that earlier in the day and tiny had soaked it up like a sponge. If I do swear she reports me to other Nana my bc buddy but I have even got her swearing now. oops Ok maybe not ladylike, but even our Princess Ann tells reporters to Naff off. Hope you sleep better tonight, I am gonna have a nice mug of warm milk with spice on the top and hopefully warm bath, if not, back on here at some ungodly hour seeing what you all been up to. Lots of lovely bedding plants in the stores but due to no sign of Spring yet will not waste money to watch them turn to ice pops. Not as bad as you temp wise but still wintery, first day of spring 21st here, who are they kidding ? still in thermal everything from knickers outward. Big Hug to soon to be magnificent chested Nihahi xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",

Flippin steroids are giving it loads, need this energy later today NOT NOW. Mug of tea going down a treat, at least not ready to eat my way throught the cupboards yet, Lovely to get back a bit of appetite, watching fat content as enjoying being two sizes smaller, shame don't have lovely taut skin but asap will be hitting the fake tanning cream. My one bit of joy is making sure I look as good as possible each day. It really does lift your spirits. Have arm excercise class 10.30 followed by rad, one more tomorrow then off for four days over Easter weekend. Bingo pub is having an egg hunt indoors on Sunday, hope ED will let GD come out to play. DH is up early today as he has to source wood for shower tray base. NOT a happy bunny moaned all evening til I took myself off for HOT soak and thenannounced we were going to bed. Hopefully all will go well ,just glad I will be out until lunchtime as house will have plumber plus yummy gas man hopefully fitting new gas fire and realigning fire surround. Got GD from 1 pm so she can help us this afternoon with DIY warehouse, we can have tea and cake whilst Papa walks around in a state of bliss, gazing at nuts bolts and screws. Like Liefie's DH and plants. Making one of my creations today too an 18th birthday cake, she wants red and black, so here goes lol. Also diaper cake for my dear friend who has become Nana to twins, one of each so ideal family in one fell swoop. Her son is one of the team that fishes out people who fall in our Mersey River, cold and very dangerous. Lots of people decide to end their lives this way so therefore put his and colleagues lives at risk. Off to make second mug of tea and catch up with TV recordings. Love and hugs to all. Tea and cake was delicious Traii, thanks hope you less knackered and DS sugar free lol x Laters xx",

Two for Papa then had to test the rest i.e demolished the lot. She is usually a savoury girl, think because she made them she had to eat them. Making some choccy easter ones for my lovely rad girls to take tomorrow. Hope you have a peaceful evening and good sleep, has this improved for you ?? What is your weather like now, little flurry of snow this morning here. Please don't let it stick. Tiler just arrived for shower,DH got his wood, took him half an hour, asked him why he freaked out last night \" that's just me \" says he, \" pack it in says I \" don't need the drama. ED had crisis meeting with the builder last night and her fella wiped the floor with them, all sorts not sorted and work started. Says in contract they have to apply for planning permission even tho they don't need it. If they build out and something upsets council they will have to rip it down. Builder only just told them and work well under way. All the workies have just turned up. Standing around like spare parts as boss not arrived. Worse part is ED works with his wife !! She is dreading going into work. This is costing as much as her first house did so don't need any extra stress. Will have to stop DH giving the \" advice \" tonight beacause as you know DH's are experts on everything lol Sleep well chick xx",

Just going to go with the flow and rest when body says so. Still flippin cold here, They have just announced it will be coldest Easter in 50 years !! -10c in parts of England. Rads was wonderful yet again yesterday, DH took me as too tired to even drive my little car.You have to tell them if you feel yuck and they were so empathic I wanted to cry. Took Immodium before I left and Johny Cash was subdued. Hopefully off to my darling baby brothers house today, only 35 mins away and DH wants to stay at home and do MAN things i.e. keep an eye on gas man fitting some kind of thermostat which should save us money on gas bill.( happy DH ) ED is driving her Mum there, at last payback for all those years of taxi ing them about. lol. Made a diaper cake yesterday for my dear friend to give to her boy and girl twin grandbabas for easter, will try and post pic. Wrinkly butt having Easter break, so shower room has come to a halt, looking good tho. Glad I stamped foot about modernising it. When in the middle of Ring of fire yesterday couldnt believe that there was a plunber in both loos !! Edi in bit of panic to say the least, DH asked one of them if he could take a quick break, I was mortified as when that bxxxxxd hits can be in there for ages, You really do lose all dignity and inhibitions with BC. ED's remo going smoothly now thank goodnes future SIL had a meeting with them and went over every point  think they got a shock as he is one clever lad and he calmly told them that if anything goes wrong due to them not following things discussed to the letter he will SUE their butts off .ED said they went white lol. Yesterday all plans etc came through their letter box and things now galloping safely ahead. Dakota, chipped teeth oowww are they his grown up ones ? hope he is ok.Have a lovely Easter with your little chicks. Keep well x Nihahi, Poor Kristina, she must be sooo weak, glad something they can sort.Must be hard to motivate her right now but she will soon be safe with you and DH. When my son was born my iron went with him, a nurse used to arrive every morning with the biggest syringe you have ever seen and harpoon Edi's butt. Top of leg was black for years after. I was told to eat lots of tangerines and my husband used to post bottles of Guiness thru hospital window and I drank a bottle before breakfast every morning   YUK. Took a while but got there eventually with you caring for her sure she will be bouncing around very soon. I have one more cmf next Tuesday  then LAST CHEMO end of April. Hope twcbm is keeping chilled x Websister, hope you picking up energy wise and Mum too. Have voted for DIL what an angel!! no wonder u love her so. Hope herceptin not affecting you se wise ?x Liefie, I too love your plan as kids not there, Skype is magic isn't it. If you fancy a face to face natter one day will send you my link. Your food sounds sooo yum my tummy rumbling. Have a great time x Movie, big hug from me and Sergie, he is smiling today as meerkats like eggs choc or not lol x Traii, you keep relaxing and get those feet up. Edi doesn't get to do Easter eggs due to diabetes, small piece of DH's will have to do  or maybe BIG piece when no one looking. Envy you decent weather really cold even in the house today waiting for central heating to kick in x All you warriors not mentioned, you are in my heart and thoughts every minute of every day. Have a wonderful Easter and hopefully lots of chocolate xx",

Off to egg hunt at local pub at 3pm with DD's and GD's think I am more excited than them lol. After busy day yesterday slept really deeply again, DH had to roll me over on to side in the middle of the night as I was snoring soooo loud    as I said when he was moaning this morning, this is payback time for all the years of road drill lol. As he said I rarely snore but seems I was giving it 20 decibles ALL night. He is pissing about in the shower room  ( not literally ) last night he was tired and I said sit down and relax but noooo then he cut a very important piece of wood 5 inches too short ???? he had measured 3 times and still buggered it up. Dancing with temper in middle of the living room and I just said lets get some sleep otherwise I would have strangled him with the tape measure. This morning he has managed to join it together and fill the join so now happy easter bunny. Have a lovely joint of pork with garlic and rosemary for roast this evening. Have put on one pound so defo eating more, had dish of fries in pub with GD's yesterday and no pain or burning, such a relief. Little bit of sugar free choc may slide down later. Liefie, are u sure your DH isn't my DH's long lost brother ? Like you and dear nihahi I like clutter free  ( just dont look in my cupboards ) DH opens one letter and manages to hit every surface with mess. I just gather up and we have a smart faux leather box under side table and Edi rams them all in there. Not popular but who cares. He makes me laugh bacause when he takes off his shoes they are carefully placed under dining table, WHY ?? Mine are in the hall where I think is easier to find them when going out. Picked up three pairs of his yesterday and hurled them in the bottom of his wardrobe where of course he couldnt find them.  Tears and prayers for that young lady. What horrendous news. Not fair. Hope organ recital went well today, will pm skype link when I can find it lol x All sisters full of choccy, it IS good for you honestly, hope you are all having a good rest too. Laters xxxx",

Only slept until 3.30 night before  got up and pottered had little sleep 5-6 then tidied kitchen cupboard DH moaning about. He gets up and I get ready for early rads. He wanted to come along ( no way ) told him to stay at home as wrinkly butt was due sometime and gas fire is also a no no  gorgeous gas man did a wonderful job but the fire is sooo hard to turn up and down.Tiny silly push type buttons, even gas man couldnt figure it out. Edi has lovely rads, comes home and after listening to sould destroying moaning off DH went to bed. Slept for two glorious hours . Awoke to sound of voices downstairs, gas man had been and gone, sob sob along with manager of fire shop. He agreed fire not fit for use and is going to get us a new one. Wrinkly butt and mate unwrapping new shower front so Edi goes next door but one for tea and cake yum. Four hours later oops rolls home and DH has face like jar of worms again. Shower front lovely and only flooring to go down today. He just finds fault with everything !! Made dinner then went to Bingo. Won line and full house  £ 30.00. Lovely end to a lovely day. Movie, beautiful bellies !! was pxxxxxg myself laughing, you too Caitlin eye tests needed lol. You saying goodbye to your girls in the shower was so poignant, gosh we are all going through such heart breaking experiences, you Diep ladies even more so. Treadmill !! you are amazing. Keep well xx Liefie, When you get to this green and pleasant land we will find each other and have tea and cake. Hope dog taking you for a walk was ok. lol xx Nihahi, You take a deep breath and chill today, love the making pathways through DD stuff, thought it was going into storage place ? If like my girls rest is probably clothes, shoes and other assorted cxxp. You are the important one today. No water !!!! defo out and visit friends. Havent checked Yoga yet, chemo brain will do today or tomorrow  Pockets tomorrow will be overflowing with sisters xx Websister, hope fatigue easing some, I was told at least three months after rads before normality    does it all never end ?? You rest when you can I do now and sod the lot of them ! I am trying to, DH  ain't paralysed and can fend for himself. xx Dakota, Gasman a hunk and also has the sweetest nature, he has wife and two lovely lads so no good for you, will ask if he has a brother lol. Topless yay so tempted myself as hair about an inch and half long but much too cold here still. In your pockets tomorrow  (((HUG))) xx Caitlin, don't fret on the weakness thing we have to go with the flow, hope it improves soon. That tax is one nasty chemo but as long as it zaps the BC Bxxxh it will be worth it. Sometimes wonder why DH's get frustrated ? We are ILL for heavens sake it isn't a head cold or piles, we are fighting for our lives here and sometimes feel like screaming that at my DH. Hate to think how they would cope, Think the sick wife bit has worn off here.I blame their flippin Mothers for making them too dependant on us lol. Big (((HUG))) xx Traii, hope you back and settled, can't wait to hear how many penguins DH kidnapped lol xx All you sisters, love hugs and healing flying to you. Will check you later. NAMASTE.",

GD woke at 6.30 exactly same time as me, down we came and made two mugs of tea and then watched Disney until ED and DH got up about eight. They are going back to MIL soon but would be quite happy if they stayed forever. ED's remo going more smoothly now as her FIL an ex builder has been and told them in no uncertain terms what is right and what is wrong. Massive bi fold doors going in next weekend they will be the nearly the whole wall of back of house. They look out onto her 125 foot garden which will be lovely. We are going to DIY place this avo to look at water feature, if he starts on the boring stuff I will find a spade and bury him in the gardening part. Liefie, my 85 year old friend is actually wobbly on her legs due to arthritis but nothing stops that woman, she still runs her own counselling business and her brain is a sharp as an arrow. She has just finished writing a small book to explain to her children what happened to her in childhood.This will account for a lot of her issues  as they were growing up. Hope you are having a good Sunday xx Movie, hope family crisis is over and you are ok xx Nihahi, Hope fab new girl is behaving and you are being cosseted and fussed over. Miss you xx Dakota, Superwoman should be your name !! Take care and please don't overdo things xx Scottie, BC and alcohol wow love you love you. I have a small scotch every evening and thought oh sod it and now may be actually improving chances. Take care and cheers xx Traii, cyber baby you way too quiet, hope you are ok xx All you glorious girls happy Sunday,  xx",

DH working today, Tuesday and Wednesday yay !! chance to have a bit of fun . Roof being made from a dormer to normal roof over next three weeks also next door having his done too. Two pleasant Liverpool lads doing the work. They have already done two houses over the road and are very efficient. At least all work outside. Weather here improving  getting warmer and less wet. Big funeral on Wednesday for Maggie Thatcher, the iron lady. Edi will be glued to TV people spotting í.e. famous people. Rumours of nasty demo's too. Feel so sorry for her family. She wasn't everyones favourite Prime Minister but she did make Women realise that we can do anything. She died in the Ritz Hotel London surrounded by flunkies and no family sooo sad. Traii, hi chick  lovely idea keepsake box, it sounds beautiful. Just finished a diaper cake for baby boy and sooo enjoy making them, but your keepsake sounds really gorgeous and lots of thought gone into it. Gotta ask what are Pokies ? Hope your cold improves, GD was sneezing like a goodun when she was here, she does put tissue over nose and then washes her little mitts. Hope it worked for Nana's sake. Try those facepacks, good fun, thought of you when she is smearing my face with yummy choc. Gold Coast for Mum and Dad sounds wonderful. Happy housework day, then feet up. xx Liefie, being a Grandparent is most definitely better than being a parent lol. You can give them back at end of the day . How dare DH want the laptop !! Mine will be going behind cushion soon as DH will be up early to spy on workmen,xx Caitlin, lovely that you aren't suffering too many se's, I have found as getting to end of treatments they do seem to ease. DH fancies maybe a large Urn standing on bed of pebbles where water comes out of top and runs down outside back into tank hidden underneath but heaven knows what we will end up with. Hope you have lots of company whil DH is visitin MIL, hope she is ok.xx Dakota, You ok after being busy at weekend ? Are you working this week, please tell me you are resting while chicks at school. xx Bearcub big (((HUG))) how long is your hair now ? Mine seems to grow longer overnight.xx Hear movement upstairs, Sergie looking panicky, so netbook hibernating until later,",

It was my original title on here until one day couldn't log into thread. I literally went into melt 'down, I was like you not very far along my journey and these wonderful women were and still are my lifeline. I sobbed and kicked everything including DH, \" it's not that important \"says he imagine 65 year old out of her mind with worry and terror, not a pretty sight !!  Think he got message. Lovely neighbour who is computer savy comes to the rescue. Had to open new profile hence scouser ( because I was born in Liverpool, home of Beatles and a famous local stew called Scouse ) You are sounding better and better, promise it WILL all get easier, no matter what they do to you it is do able. Means to an end i.e. killing the BC bxxxh. Your dear DH can't have known what your dx would be, it could have been a benign lump, I have had them for years and years and the shock when it wasn't blew this old dears socks off. You have now started to help others on here to. Dear Dakota will be grateful for your input. Just continue doing what you can cope with, this journey will be over before you know it. If things become unbearable we sisters go to our meadow, get comfortable and imagine a beautiful meadow with a stream, you are bare foot and walk to the stream. Sit on the largeflat rocks at the edge and put your feet in the flowing water, let it take all your fears away. Then lie back on the rock and bask in the sun, smell the flowers and listen to the sounds of nature. Love and big (((hug))) Edi xxxx",

Other GD so quiet and well behaved can't believe born only three months later. DD then says she hates shopping with naughty one  know the feeling !!!! All done now ,have just eaten veg shepherds pie and mushy peas \"parp\" excuse me please. It never hit the sides on the way down ( Mom's saying ) ice cream and strawberries for afters too so wonderful to have appetite back, don't eat loads but enjoy what I have ,and burning pipes  calming every  day. Alive LOVE the meadow pic, didn't hear you creeping up with your camera ha ha. It is such a special place started many months ago, reving up to an instalment of our story.

Bingo tonight so hope to win but even so lots of fun and laughter. Ray our bingo caller serenades us with Fran Sinatra songs in the interval !! Yesterday lay on settee in back room and gazed at the beautiful cloud formations through the back patio doors.Nature can make such beauty and such destruction. Watched video of Oklahama and just can't imagine how awful it was for the wonderful brave residents. Dakota, not just you, this site is a pain as have to log in everytime I come on. Hope that Prince is about to appear very soon. xx Traii, glad cough/cold improving, always imagine it is hot hot hot where you are. Winter must be a shock to the system. Here always piggin winter at the moment. Sun shines you open door and Brrrr. Great Mum and Dad having DS there is NO WAY you could manage, he would defo be even more hyper if he knows you are no usual healthy Mum. He will adore time with your parents and they will love every minute too. Mrs Brown's Boys lol one of my favourites. Silly me didn't even realise it was a man for ages !! You are so right that even when kids grow up we worry just the same if not even more. Take care and get your strength up. xx Nihahi, Pics are gorgeous, can feel the grass of the meadow under my feet when looking at them. Don't be sorry about thinking of yourself, us Mom's don't do it enough. Hope your children get sorted out healthwise soon. Do hope Lovemy is nowhere near the destruction. xx Movie, you too, have some YOU time you will come back full of energy from Japan. Don't forget lots of pics. Hope DD sorted soon, sod's law when her life is looking good POW fate stomps in and messes it ALL up.xx Maria, your pockets will be a mess tomorrow, what with the cakes and coffees sloshing about but WE will be there. As Liefie said sore and itchy sure sign of hair loss. I swept my fringe to one side and it came off in my hand.Burst out laughing, it's going to happen and it DOES come back so go with the flow. Worst part is picking hair off clothes and bedding. If you can get it buzzed really short as much easier to cope with. Youtube has some great videos on scarf tying if you want to do that. Put on makeup and nice earrings if you wear them and flaunt the look.xx Liefie, hi Superwoman, Great boys got back safe and sound. Love the comment about paying for their own gas lol. Amazed you will be driving soon. Wow. Ed was so thrilled about her job, she went in yesterday and they announced it to rest of staff. One chap who had also applied has been causing murder being spiteful and nasty so her day spoilt. Hope I don't ever come across him, he will need a set of Mooseballs if Edi meets him. Dream was something else, sure as Alive says has hidden meaning but bit creepy just the same. When I am stressed I have the same dream every time where I need the loo NOW and always end up stark naked sitting on one in the middle of a shopping mall. ????? Analyse that one lol xx Alive, blessings and ((( hugs ))) xx Caitlin your Mom is a hoot, Johny freakin Cash has kept away today, phew.

Not that long ago you werent eating, had horrid se's and had been through chemo which made you soooo ill, the sisters are right you must give your body a chance to recover. We all want our old lives back but must be kind to ourselves and do a little then rest, I too am convinced it hasn't gone and will appear somewhere else very soon, again normal, my friend is 2 years out and every ache is cause for panic we now try and make light of how we feel as we are going to ruin what time we may have left by wallowing in doom and gloom. No one knows how much time we have left but I am sure YOU WILL  be here many years from now, housework for instance is something that gets done here when nothing better to do  friends come to see YOU not how your home looks. As for the lawn, surely there is someone ie. fit young man who will help a damsel in distress, we have volunteers at hospital who will do things like this, make enquiries. There are lots of things I can't swallow still too, fries,chips,brown bread, kill me ! burning pipes still flare up even now.I stick to bland foods but feel better for putting half a stone back on up to now. Lecture over, remember we ALL love you and need you, you got us all together on here so don't you dare give up on us now. Maria, can't post pics at the moment, don't know how to on this laptop Liefie, you need to take more care of yourself ! Poor you. Glad you are getting lots of help from your visitors. Traii hope you are home ? Nihahi, your weather is MAD, hot here again, DH and I had a BBQ yesterday, first one for well over a year. Sat in garden until mid evening. ED remo back on track, kitchen almost useable. She has started on her 150 foot long back yard. After builders it is a mess. She could have a herd of cows out there and you wouldn't notice them. Mowenna, hope your infection responding to treatment. Watching America's got talent. Young man dressed as a Goth came out and sang like a Soprano !!!! Excitment building here as the birth of Prince William and Kate's baby comes nearer.  Party time. yay Coffee time, wonderful Sunday everyone. xx",

DH gone off to work he must be pooped with all the driving but was pretty amazing. Newly weds off to Maldives today hope they stay safe. Seems it is the season there for storms !! Benny, DH fascinated that you likened him tp Ed Asner, googled pics and you are right ! You made his day, thanks. Would love to see pics of Trevor and Benny. Your home must be such fun, Sharon sounds a hoot too. Bet your hair is lovely ! at least it DID come back never thought mine would lol. Girls are right, you are superwoman, laundry just about manageable today and probably naps in between loads, or on them if gets too much. My feet did get sore at the wedding as did everyones, we all just kicked off the shoes and walked on the lovely cool stone floors. The shoes in the photo were a last minute purchase, I had given up on finding low heels in matching colour, browsing in local thrift store and there they were in my size ! So glad I found them, the original ones would have been like having foot in a vice lol. Morwenna, hope rads appointments improved for you. Dakota, how did your wedding go.? Traii, so glad DS better, my DS had ear problems as a little one and they are so painful. Hope that incision less sore. Liefie, you put me to shame too with the energy you have. Was DH making sausages or cooking them ? The bunny pie reminded me of a story from around here, there was a movie called Watership Down which you may have seen. In local butchers window was a row of bunny carcasses hanging up ( yuk ) Underneath was a sign reading \" you read the book, saw the Movie, now EAT the cast \" Some nasty butchers out there lol. Love your description of me at the wedding, wish it was true, tried my best to look cool and refined but so wanted my slippers and housecoat ha ha. Sorry you have an iffy tum too. It really makes life hell sometimes. Good luck with the baby blanket.Sure it will be beautiful. Like Traii would love to hear you play. Nihahi, Hope DH had a great birthday. Sounds like a great time was planned. Love poster of light too. Websister, thanks for your lovely comments on f/b pic. Hope you had a good weekend of peace and quiet. We need to recharge our batteries sometimes. Movie, Go girl !! So jealous of your Wilburs creek get together. Tim Tams too. Lots of pics required. BRAT diet is good, thanks. Hope your pooch recovers well, my little yorkie had BC Vet operated then said she wouldnt survive very long. She passed five years later from something else. Don't give up. Will send you and DD a cheer you up cake on next post. Carla, sent you a message on F/B. Bianca/Sharon welcome hope all goes well for you. Laters xxxx",

Websister, hope you are sleeping better. Those shoes were such a good find !How is GD ? Nihahi, Glacier trip sounds so wonderful, you and Movie will have a ball with your friend. Volunteering on hold right now as DH just loses it if I as much as mention it. Right now can't cope with any stress. Will explain why next week, lots going on. Baking lots of little cakes as DD and ED attending fundraising for heart foundation on Saturday. Their friend died on the Rugby pitch aged 16, 20 years ago and now they are all meeting up to raise funds in his memory. Shedman eating lots and has put on 10 lbs, things are improving for him thank goodness. His little GD being christened later this month so lovely family celebration coming up for him. Watching a TV programme this morning and half of the presenters have been off with tummy bug that is going around. So glad only me got it at the time of the wedding. Put wedding pics taken by my ED on my f/b timeline if anyone wants to flick through.Hard to believe the castle is a family home to couple with two children. !! They have to open to the public to pay the bills. Love to all not mentioned. Laters xxxx",

Visit here often it really will get you through and we will all celebrate with you at the end of your journey. Liefie, your DH is a brave man !!

DH gets up and asks \" what are WE doing today ? \" You do what you like, I have two cakes to finish says Edi. He actually left me in peace except to pass lovely comments at how amazing cake for my friend is. Shedman popped in with some cake from his GD's christening. They chatted then neighbour came and helped DH to fix new light in kitchen, I have been waiting weeks and it is like cooking in the black hole of Calcutta. Then he showered and got all dressed up to pick up GD from school. She helped him clean patio door glass and did a brilliant job. Her Daddy came to collect her,  thinks DH bike is fantastic and gave him lots of hints and tips re pump and tools for changing tyres etc. We were going dancing, but he has a nasty cold and a cold sore so now starting week after we come back from hols. I am pretty knackered actually so bit of a relief. One cake finished and one half done so will model figures for that tonight then out for a walk tomorrow.

You are all soooo funny with the banter. Nihahi, Good luck with the election, meeting with sisters sounds great, give Benny a hug and slap from me too. Thought about mechanic too but didn't want to put my foot in it.Also big hug for Morwenna.If any of you can, send us a photo of the meeting please.Liefie's Skype seemed to be playing up. We had sound but no picture, Movie tried on her tablet and all was well, saw their dear faces and had a lovely live chat. It is an amazing thing, easy to apply and free !! Adagio, found a new thread last night, \" you can survive TNS \" much happier content and long term survivor posted as well. Have fun with Liefie, she is a sweetheart.First Mamo was NO worse than normal one, try and relax, my lumpectomy was on top quarter of breast so was worried but no need.Hip Tons better thanks for asking. Dakota, life sounds good and busy for you. Tats will be the finishing touch. Any news on the insect.? Benny, sounding more like your old self  :-)  Hope the car pak at Timmies IS big enough. Traii, hope fires aren't anywhere near you, can't believe they have started again.Hope work fun. Momof2, Get those giant pockets ready. Sure you will be fine very soon and wedding will be gorgeous.

For heavens sake nobody knows how to cure many types of Cancer for sure, if they did, forums like these would not exist and we would all be well and healthy. I had a lumpectomy with no node involvment, 6x3 weekly Epirubicin followed by 6x3weekly CMF. Heart scan before all started but here we rarely have any other kind of scans first or even after unless symptoms arise. My Onco is supposed to be the best and has been going for many years.  He said\" we will give you this for the best chance and to mop up any stray cells out there.\" 25 Rads followed so it had better be gone !! Carla had a different diagnosis to start and unless it is just me ? seems to have been mis diagnosed from the start. She contacted me re the TN ,and seemed to be in shock but hopeful they would get her on the right track. SE's from chemo I had were no picnic but could have been much worse. Next day always ok, then for a few days running to loo then fine until next time. Just planned life around it. Girls on here helped sooo much. Neulasta shot each time too, no se's and kept bloods ok.DONT read too much about the TN a lot of it is ancient information anyway. Keep chomping the choc eclairs X Liefie is due to fly over here any minute will wave from deck Hope she has the BEST of times, she is adorable and deserves some fun, joy and laughter.

Wish I could summon up some energy. Helped out in charity shop yesterday for a few hours, it was really strange being \"useful \" again.Mad busy and bags of stuff came in by the minute. People are so kind, the shop funds a cancer charity for children.Going to do Thursday afternoons for a while and see how I go. DH will spend the time with my co workers husband who is an old friend so thats him sorted too. Gd's birthday party great fun yesterday she is growing into a young lady. Eyes starting to close thank goodness, X",

One poor man has been electrocuted by a power cable but no other deaths at the moment. DH now watching football  But at least he has stopped trotting around the house with his flaming torch !! He will be out at first light checking for damage. Jennifer, meant to say the placemats are a WONDERFUL idea. Saves all that sewing and the fact they were the same colour shows it was meant to be. Hope your storm doesn't affect you too much. Really weird the way we are all getting weather totally alien to our particular countries. According to our \"experts \" it is something to do with the Gulf Stream going haywire. Load of tosh !! We have messed up our planet and this is payback time. Liefie, did you like Gravity ? Not too fond of those 3d glasses myself all a bit too near ha ha. Dakota! hope the storm doesn't get to you. My DS went back home today we did have a lovely time. Worried sick about him though, he is so obese that he can hardly walk. the diabetes in our family will surely hit him if he doesn't lose some weight. Hate to nag him as he is such a sweetheart but tried to gently put the idea of maybe losing some weight soon as his sisters have done for health reasons.Years ago asked his wife to maybe encourage him to watch his weight and the nasty piece of work went for me hammer and tongs. she now too is massive and I really don't care what happens to her but he is another story?Know he is unhappy so think he comfort eats. Rant over, going to sleep now noise of flying objects has died down. Stay safe, we'll and happy ALL of you X   ",

I know you don't want any hassle at the moment but if you can stop this happening to another lady it will be worth it.If they know the day and time you were there a bit of empathy training would not go amiss for the assistant on duty. You won't go back, how many others ? If it was my business I would want to know feedback. You don't have to give your details but it is a bit like my Reiki Master told me once. if you have something that has upset you write it down then burn,bury, or put it in a box. Works for me, but otherwise go back on a different day and maybe find the nice assistant Websister has dealt with and deal with her.

( to sleep ha ha ) We could have had a natter !! Crossing everything that your bloods perfect. ! Will be with u tomorrow sitting on your shoulder willing everything to go well. Little bit of good news :-) Lisa of the baldy birds charity had results of latest CT scan yesterday and her tumours have shrunk by a third. She has six more of this lot, but has been told she should be good to take her DS and lovely partner on that dream holiday to Disney in February.Hope they can keep her around for many more years. X Lesleyann, your post was really lovely. So very true that we have to do this sxxt one day at a time. Some good some soooo bad but will one day be a distant memory. :-) x Dakota, are you ok ? Reiki does make a lot of sense and hope that helps you daughter and maybe our Benny too. R u chemo tomorrow, scared to go back a page and check because will lose all this I am sure lol. If so will travel astrally to your shoulder too and tell you naughty jokes to make you giggle.lol. Going to rummage around some junk shops for legs for a little basketware dolly crib we are doing up for GD. Modern legs will look awful, we need some older one's and would you believe on E.bay they cost a flippin fortune ! I will probably come back laden down with all sorts from the local charity shops. Sod this internet shopping, let me rummage YAY. Benny u any better ? x Carla, sorry your boy has gone, but so hope you keep getting well X Bevlee, where you been girl ? never mind lolling about in the sun here in the country of your birth eyebrows could freeze off ! I still have mine and eyelashes too :-) But not counting any chickens lol. x Laters girls. Edi XXXX",

We know you are trying so hard and we are all proud of you. Lesleyann post was inspiring to us all and I too will keep reading it when awful things kick in. Hope you managed the veggie stews.

She won't see my astral body he he.Be careful you don't hurt Websister if you put your big cold mitts in your pockets, think she may have to move to your other shoulder to keep her safe. Your Aunty sounds like a lovely lady. I go completely hyper with the steroids I have them by IV and would love them every day lol. I too do here and F/B till all hours much to DH's horror. Nail Varnish sounds lush colour, mine deep burgundy colour at the moment. Nice that no one realised about your wig. Took GD to light show by us day before yesterday like yours all proceeds go to good cause think DH and I enjoyed it as much as she did. We were dancing to the mad xmas music much to her amusement. Good Luck tomorrow Loopy Lou X Dakota, the same to you with knobs on. Hope all goes really smoothly. X DH gonna unplug this thing in a minute ! Nightie Nightie, Edi X",

As Traii has said you are a fighter, wipe up those tears and come out with the boxing gloves on for round two. I know you will be thinking \" it's all right for them to say do this and do that \" but you are the Captain of your ship and the Master of your fate.

Only thing I wouldn't use again was a block of baby soap on the top layer, too heavy and hard to attach. Double sided tape is great for attaching things. Look at a few videos as lots of ideas.

Websister, Couldn't take any more so rang Doc, as it is Saturday they put you through to the local hospital, out of hours. A gentle kind voice asked what he could do for me and I couldn't tell him for sobbing. Finally gave him all the gory details and he said come straight away and he would see me as an urgent case. ( you can wait hours and hours ) Fifteen minutes later I was in his office, seems I have a nasty infection in my mouth. He took bloods and prescribed strong antibiotics. Gave me a very soothing spray so I can eat and tablets for the burning pipes.If bloods come back with anything bad he will ring me tonight. If no better by tomorrow I am to go straight back and he will see me right away. Daughter came this afternoon GD ill in bed now with sore throat. Seems the bully also calls GD clever clogs on top of the fat and ugly. She is top of her class and no doubt he resents that, but she goes out of her way to help others.They will get it sorted soon I am sure. Hope you are having the best of times with your DH. Benny, Di still looks gorgeous. Sorry you suffering again, hope it eases soon. You really must look after yourself, lots of food and rest. You will be back to full health soon and can spend all the time in the world with her without getting worn out. Going to make dear DH something to eat as I have had him running around after me all day. Time to spoil him. Love to ALL sisters xxxx",

Didn't know that about Kate, will tell GD might give her a bit of hope  Meeting Kate is the best thing that could have ever happened to our handsome Prince. He is so like his Mum in looks and nature too. He needed a girl with no airs and graces and she is a breath  of fresh air. Baby on the way too yay. Di would have loved this all and in a way was also bullied by the worlds press. Just cleaned downstairs bathroom, so another tea break, but having a lovely day.   Will also tell her sisters are in her pockets, she was born prem in a bit of a rush and was breech. When they finally gave her poor Mum a section her legs were jammed bent upwards almost to her ears. They thought she might never straighten them and walk  properly , intense physio, also carried on at home every day by her Mum has made sure she could stand strong and tall. No evil little sxd is going to bend her spirit. Times like this would love Harry Potters cloak that makes you invisible, he would soon learn the error of his ways lol.   Agree on the Moose issue, would at least know if one of THEM was sneaking through the window.",

Last night DH said hair growing a bit, think he is right !! Benny, Nice to hear from you. Please tell me your diet consists of something more than Glucerna and potatoes ? You will never put any weight back on with this. Glucerna I know contains some protein 30 percent and some vitamins but is used here in weight loss for diabetics. Potatoes I know you can swallow mash but surely liquidised veggie stuff will build you up more. ? I am on Amoxicillin for a week for mouth, and it is clear today. Difflam spray which soothes the soreness. Doc also gave me Omeprazole tablets which can be taken twice a day to ease burning in tum. Saline sounds good for nose. Going to start saline rinse as soon as next cmf starts to hopefully stop mouth soreness next time. Glad weather improving, hope you can get out a little just don't knock yourself out.x Websister, Glad you had a lovely trip, you deserve it. Got two week break from that dance lol. Waiting on app for my tat they want to overlap last chemo in April with rads don't think I will be full of energy then somehow either. You just rest and get your strength back. Sorry to hear of the car incident, just what you need right now, Had same thing myself two years ago, stupid man wrote off my gorgeous little car and as he got out of his car he said \" Oh not again \" seems not the first time he had done it.

DH thinks my netbook is my life too, get up early to check here and f/b then when hear him walking about upstairs, switch  it off and stick it behind a cushion lol. We had pancake day yesterday, the run down to Ash Wed ( today ) and lent. Had FOUR pancakes with lemon and sweetner. DH was tickled as I don't eat half as much as I did but I really enjoyed them.

DH tried to get me to rest but nooo. I slept eventually for 4 hours and got up made 2 dozen chocolate fairy cakes to take to Bingo . Then put on the fringe on a band and created a turban out of some lovely soft material a friend gave me. Wound silk band around near the front then added a gold and crystal scarf clip at the front, three or four ladies at the Bingo wanted to know where I bought my hat ! Trotted up to the charity shop and wham, room spun ,cheeks went bright pink and I burst into tears. Next thing I knew was on a comfy chair with glass of water and being hugged by lots of sweet ladies. The boss then put me in her car and bought me home. Now feel like I have been run over.

You made me laugh ( thanks ) with the wig story, we do need to laugh about all this don't we. ? x Traii, hope your little tootsie's are less painful this morning ? How are your dry hands, did the cream and gloves do any good ? My skin appears to be drying out a bit :-( will have to get DH to rub me over with an oily rag lol x Bevlee, fancy you being a scouser. Have you ever been back here for a holiday ? My DH drives a bus around Newferry sometimes. We live in Upton wirral now but were both born and bred in Lpool. Lovely to have you in our Valley. Chemo not bad for most people as Benny say's .It's the means to an end.

The fact Heartland ran for 3 hours is wonderfull too. Thank you for sharing your experience in hospital with the sisters, you coped in the way best for you and came out the other side. Many years ago I was in for 17 days after the birth of my son. I can honestly say it was terrifying.I was hardly able to walk due to severe anaemia got halfway down a corridor trying to see my baby collapsed and was frogmarched back to my room  ( cell ) I too cried more than ever before or since. Hospitals still instill a stomach churning terror even now.Of course things have improved since then but SO understand how trapped you must have felt. Nanna nod was sooo good, DH then tucked me up in bed at 10.30 and I slept like a baby for the first time in weeks until 7am. Still feel a bit like I have had a truck reverse over me, muscles aching,  bit weak and breathless but hey ho, bit further along the path. Alicethecat, what a great post ! Sure it will help our Benny and any others of us who hit that wall on our journey. Positive stories like this are wonderful.  Thank you.x Liefie, What an exciting time you have coming up. Sure your cakes will arrive intact.We need to hear all about the wedding and sure your playing will make it extra special for them.Ba hroom design on hold, that SE stopped for now thank goodness ! No doubt will continue after next chemo. lol X I hope you all don't mind if  share my nice happenings with you  today. We had 6 yr old GD overnight while her Mum and Dad went to an Elbow concert. She went to bed at 7pm woke at 7am peeped around the bedroom door, tiptoed across the floor and gave me the most beautiful cuddle. DH said \" what is today \" \" My Nana's birthday\" she replies. Card flowers and chocolate birthday cake complete with candles then appeared. Being 65 suddenly ain't that bad. Having chinese takeaway toni ght with family :-)) Can't wait for my  70th next. Still only feel about 35 until I look in the mirror lol. Will log in this evening to see what you have all been up to. have a happy day. X",

I flew from here to Amsterdam 45 mins and almost had the vapours. lol. Hope your trip is as lovely as you are.x Benny, That wig is lush ! You may find when yours loosens some more you just want it gone, I did and had a buzz off with clippers at the salon. At least what then comes out is short bits, easier to brush off everything. Than when that looked tufty, had shaved  and on went the wig, voila ! look just like before and no one believes it is a wig either. Don't care anyway as it will grow back one day .Hope your Sunday is better day for you, would so love a gossip over soup at my table may meet you in a dream will try the Astral travel too. Are the guitars in the photo yours ? I am being nosey as my DH has played for about 50 years and when he is feeling a bit overwhelmed by all this BC cxxp he goes and strums away for hours.The five year old GD have small acoustic guitars too and have started writing their own songs.x Traii cyber baby girl, SE's seem to have subsided thank goodness. The cake went down a storm with my friend. Just come back from his party. I did Karaoke for the first time in my life ! 9 to 5, Dolly Parton, lol Dh looked as if he couldn't believe it was me. Then danced my feet off, bit pooped now but what fun. My little brother coming for Sunday roast tomorrow so looking forward to catching up.Hope your Sunday is good too. X Dakota, told you that you would get to soccer and hockey, bet you look stunning. I pinched my DH's electric razor and took of those pesky prickles tonight, my wig tons more comfy. Going to buzz over everyday to keep it that way.x Bevlee, Hey you ex scouser let us know how you are please. X Joanne,Websister and any other sisters reports on your progress needed,we care about you. My ED's friends did their head shave in huge mall in Liverpool city centre today. So far the have raised about £ 14,000.00 GBP in three weeks ! They all look beautiful too. Looks as if their friends dream of getting her family to Disney may come true. :-) Her story is on' baldy birds for lisa williams' on you tube. and the head shave video on there too. ' Baldy birds campaign 'It is awsome.If any of you watch it I am on the campaign one twice. In the supermarket 4th from left on first group, clutching a pink bucket. Then again 4th from left at end of tills. Old biddy with glasses and short reddish blonde hair ( wig no 1 ) lol.

You can feel the warmth and healing flowing through your body. Reflexology is gentle pressure from her fingers on the soles of your feet. ( No it really doesnt tickle ) then wonderful cream rubbed all over your poor skin. I have been to her for 15 years and it is a real treat. If your lymph scars are stiff and sore i have found Bio Oil sooo good. BC nurse said it is ok to use. You can get it in pharmacy or on the internet think E.bay or Amazon. Heals scars,helps stretch marks,and blemishes.Very smooth and gentle my scars really smooth and comfy. Traii, hope day at work not too yucky. Get sucking those lemon drops for the furry tongue.

My husband was struggling with my dx then I found an amazing book  \"Breast cancer husband \"by Marc Silver. Bought it from Amazon. He sat and quietly read the whole thing and changed completely.There is lots of good information in it for you too. Marc wrote it because his wife had BC and every book out there was written for women only. As Benny says so much has changed since your Mum and her Mum had this and if your Mum upsets you, speak up please. This is all about you and only you now. We have all had the horror stories from others but you must walk away. If things become too much come on here, we are from all over the world and someone will get back to you as soon as possible. I promise you one thing you will smile again we all do. Yes you will cry and be angry all of which is natural but once your treatment plan is in place and started your journey back to good health will start.

Little roses were scratch mitts rolled up. You can also do that with tiny socks. Liefie, I do think women should rule this world anyway. We would not send our boys and girls away to die in wars about oil etc. We would sit down with our knitting, coffe and cakes and work it all out. Good advice to Bevlee, if you visit Dr Google everything you have ever eaten,drunk,inhaled or sprayed causes cancer of some sort. I personally blame all the flippin hormones they put in meat but heyho too late now as you say. Jm, ((( Hug ))) to you thinking of you, hope all went well, Nihahi, Magnolia Buckskin !! not just you ha ha. Hope peas did the trick. I have a tiny bit of backache so have just bought a lavender wheat roll to micro for heating up. Pop behind me while sitting watching TV and it is magic. Seems I can also freeze it so that is handy. Benny, Thinking of you every day XXXXX Scottie< glad I can make you laugh, only reason DH married me. One night in bed years ago I had him roaring with laughter ( no sex involved by the way ) Door flies open and teenage daughter stands there hands on hips. \" Will you two be quite, I am trying to sleep \" We had to pull duvet over our heads and put hands over mouths. Traii, Love the bike one, can you tell me her page on F/B please so I can have a good nose ? Pics are great too. Men in tight shorts, fan me with a dead kipper, phew. Don't care what if anything they are kicking lol. In your pocket tomorrow, could you pop a portaloo in there please in case se's start. You might want to give me my own pocket ha ha. We are having fish for dinner too. With tiny spuds, garlic mushrooms, and peas. Baby showers new here too. People seem to take a present to them then just a card when little sprog arrives. Otherwise expensive do. Dakota, sure your work pic stunning. When my ED got married she looked so beautiful, I know she is anyway, but she had blue contact lenses in, silicone nails, and chicken fillets in her bra to make boobs look like they existed.We all do it BC or not. Bevlee, big hug girl, creased up with the moose info on a PANTY LINER.Whatever next. Hope your brother wins.  Second part of CMF was done and dusted in one hour today ! Feel great but always do on the day. Didn't have to see onco doc after all. We had packed sandwiches and a flask as even though they have a great cafe there you can guarantee the minute you settle down they call you. Hope everyones se's are minimal. Love you all more than chocolate  x",

Only problem is eating out, sure if you google there will be organic restaurants. Lots of students there and they all seem to prefer the healthier options. Just did a quick google and there are five in the middle of glasgow> Hope i have right city ? GD and her mum not long left, what a tonic.

Couldnt put anything near my mouth without bursting into tears, gorgeous Doc sorted me out and was kindness itself. So glad I rang for help . Your get together sounds just what you needed, GD is coming later with ED so I will be having a laugh too.

This is my second one on 26th. two more then yahoo. Early April finish I think . Then rads, hope all done by May barring any disasters. Hair still same DH reckons it looks like it is growing but I am not losing anymore, Sleep well cyber baby girl. Scottiee, Don't forget I don't work anymore. Would be if it wasn't for this. Sure if I was doing what you do DH would be lucky to get beans on toast lol Spoke before to my old boss, he has lost the pub due to trade being so bad. After 15 years he is gutted but had to get out before he went bankrupt. Businesses like his are closing in their hundreds every week. Cheaper to stay home and have a drink.",

Got a little story for you about those horrible insects. Our first house was a little terraced place in Liverpool. I had NEVER seen a cocky as they are known here. One evening DH DS and I came home late evening from my Mum's, opened front door and this thing jumped off the wall and ran down the bare boards of the hall, then vanished under the skirting board. Silly me tells lady next door whilst hanging out the laundry and she says, \" be careful they crawl into your ears lay eggs which then eat your brain \" My DS who was a baba at the time went to bed in a hat with flaps over the ears tied under the chin for months !! Now I know you are thinking, silly bxxxh but I had post natal dep and was already gaga without that info. Turned out the entire area was riddled with them. Some people called in the exterminators like us. The amount of older people who swore they didn't have them was no help as each house needed to be bombed under the floors. That was our incentive to buy our first house the other side of the river so they did us a favour. Stories about cockies are folklore in Liverpool. In the days of the beehive hairdo it was reported that a young woman who just combed over the top hair each day had one lay eggs which hatched in there and she ended up in hospital !! So maybe hat on DS not so nutty. Wrinkly butt just left for the day. Tiling half done and bath in place, yay we have a shower downstairs but have sooo missed long hot soak. Don't think we can use it just yet but one step nearer. GD ran upstairs yesterday to have a look see. Came down with eyes like saucers. Nana your bathroom has gone she says. Then she looks out of patio doors to where it is neatly stacked on the back deck. Nana THERE it is. lol. Bought her a minnie mouse shower cap with big bow on it yesterday for her first sleep over shower in a few weeks. DH BP perfectly normal by the way. No medication required and licence in tact. Seems he has white coat syndrome. They SHOULD wear colours defo. Traii, lovely that all you girls going thru this together in that you will all be able to compare and help each other. I want to see a fluffy penguin too please. How lovely for you parents to have that gift from you. Happy bin day lol I have slept most of afternoon since eye test, suddenly really weary, it is flippin freezing here again. DH at work so really peaceful. Hope everyone had good day, despite treatments LOVE you all getting off before this goes Poof. xx",

Glad Alien dormant and you got some air. Two loaves can smell them from here. I love to cut of the Crust end and smother with best butter. Seeing onco tomorrow, hope they will tell me that they ARE overlapping rads and chemo. Last time registrar said they would send for me soon for tattoo but nothing more has happened.Main onco really old school, abrupt and very clinical, glad DH will be just dropping me and coming back as I need to find out more.If I get the registrar THAT will be good as Mo as he is known is young and empathic. Hope you have alien free day today. Wrinkly butt due in two and a half hours, gulp. DH spent hours counting and measuring tiles last night, heaven help the tiler. Without being disloyal my darling DH does have terrible trust issues. When things like this being done in the house he like Traii's DH is paranoid. Sure it was caused by something in his childhood but he also keeps a lot close to his chest. Can cope normally but since BC finding that I do snap at him. Will try and be nice Edi today lol. will catch up with all you Darling ladies at tea time and sending you all joy and happiness with minimal SE's.",

She puts amazing aromatherapy cream on your feet and massages up to your knees after reflex. Then she does facial massage with rose oil scented cream, it is the best hour ever. All about ME and she is a wonderful spiritual lady too. Always get a big hug when leaving too. Giant pan of pea wack soup on stove, smells lovely!! will have with hot rolls when himself gets home. Then again tomorrow after Chemo. No way does Edi cook that day I am far too ill ha ha. If you can't use the \"C\" card now and again what is the point of all this. Had bloods done \"A\" ok for tomorrow yay. When I got home the plumbers were about to finish, went up after they had gone and WOW tiling just needs six more putting up tomorrow. Then sink.loo  etc being fitted. DH was totally wrong about the tiles by the way two more boxes needed so all the hysterics for nothing, and a whole weekend spoilt with him moaning. Lots of cutting involved and man in D>I>Y place didn't take this into consideration when working out how many boxes. Traii, Reiki Brill, Bingo Wed night told DH I am going and he can get his own dinner as he is on a shift that finishes while I am out having fun. \" Yes love \" he says. He knows he is in dog house. MEN !! Hope you got that early night and had a long and dreamless sleep. Dakota, Cockroach two faced B just like my Dad, all nicey nicey when he had been unfaithful to my Mum. He too would load the guilt onto her. Her only regret before she died that she hadn't had the courage to leave him.Her only ambition was to dance on his grave. Ironically she passed away first, I think from a broken heart but I am sure I saw her spirit dancing away on the lid of his coffin. Wish she had had your courage, who knows she might still have been here with me. Old but happy. x Foxey, you defo sound stronger as nihahi says, heart test was quick and no bother when I had it. When they tell you what chemo one of us will give you tips on how to make it easier. I have a cousin on really strong chemo and she has NEVER has any se's so everyone different. Getting nearer for you but just jump in with both feet and you will be out the other end before you know it. When you are feeling really low visit the meadow, takes you to a safe and beautiful place away from all the fear. x Nihahi, Sure Risotto will be gorgeous. Peas still make me smile when I open freezer drawer. Just told DH off yay. He rang to see how I was and how wrinkly butt had got on. Nosey old git. lol.Told him to back off think he got the message lol. Hope you find decent Reiki practisioner soon, they are worth theit weight in gold. Gonna visit the meadow as I get to bed, need a walk in the sun and to dip feet in the stream. Your bald eagle, oh wow how amazing. Sure you are right about him helping to subdue alien. x Liefie and Adagio hope you are both refreshed and raring to go. x Websister how was little ones Owl party ? bet you had a wonderful time. Photos if u can x Benny, are you under that pile of excercise mats ? Hope it is with a Cabana boy lol x",

Mapping and tats a doodle as everyone says it will be. Went thru scanner and she put my right arm in a cuff above my head. Feel like I am in \" fifty shades of grey \" says I. Hysterics had by us both lol. Took a leaf from your book, as I was having my treatment sweet lady with terrified expression sits in next chair. She sat quietly and when mine was done I asked if she was ok. Just nervous first one she says, but after listening to you and hearing your stories of how people fall over when they see your baldy head I am no longer afraid because you are looking and sounding so normal. Gave her some of my lemon sherbets and blew her a kiss on way out. Hope to bump into her next time. Two tats wanted butterflies but noooo. Weeps are a nuisance as they bugger up my mascara, keeps DH on his toes tho. Think split peas not that nice really, may stick to lentils. My DH snores on his back /side/ front any way up. Can you send DS to push him off the bed please ? Love the swings too might take GD after school Thursday love that feeling of being a kid again too.

GD came for sleepover last night, she is flat out and I so envy her. She helped me make dinner, then ate every bit plus extra fries off my plate as I make the best fries EVER lol. Then she had a bath in new bathroom    into pj's and 6.15 pm asks to go to bed and crashes out. ED said she had been up since dawn waiting to come here. By the time she gets up Nana will be like a Zombie. 2 mugs of tea and 2 visits from Johny cash later hope things improve ha ha. DH dragged me out on another getting things for house expedition  3 hours later was losing the will to live. Lounge fire defo knackered you would think that new fire would be simple ? Noooo he could find fault in anything. May have found one on the internet in the end, would have saved my poor weary legs. I was doing the walking along slowly bit, what's up he says I'm tired I reply, not again he says ,I give up ! Johny cash just visted again !TMF had immodium not putting up with that. Last few days had pains in end of fingers,worried sick    any advice anyone??. Bit better right this minute but rather concerned. Scottie !!!! Fab you are back we missed you. Girlie getaway sounds fantastic. I could kill for a turkey sandwich on wholemeal with mayo please when you have a minute.x Traii, Do give the won ton a go, hope you like itThat half price deal sounds really good Can't believe Easter soon glad you have better weather hope ours does still chilly here. Sergei is sooo cute GD was allowed to cuddle him yesterday, she is very gentle and made sure her hands were clean lol. Went into kitchen and she is perched on her little step and had washed all the dishes ! Made a great job of them as well. Remodelling of her house starts tomorrow and her Mum is now in melt down mode. They are moving into other Nana's for the duration so that will be better for them than eating brick dust for the next six weeks. How you feeling now ? are you getting some decent sleep.x Movie, cracking post from you, how amazing you sound now. Hope the boobs behaving and you haven't crashed to the floor from bed. Your wedding story had me howling had to put cushion over mouth in case I woke up DH and GD. You must have been wrinkled like a prune after 5 hrs in bath !and the aunty doing sales at reception priceless !! We had a free bar at our evening do, my kid brother was bar man. DH's relatives love a drink so each and every one had a collection of full glasses on their table. My Dad closes bar for half an hour to give bros a break and they all walked out to pub over the road !!!! Families honestly love making a show of you lol Nice to know your DH like mine and Websisters thinks you are a racehorse around the shops. Tempted to fall in heap, but that would probably give mine a heart attack. Sorry to hear your daughter so poorly both those conditions horrid. Love love the poem, happy ST. Patricks day to you and ALL sisters x Laters, Irish Potatoes top of the morning/evening to you. Edi Irish dancing to the loo lol",

Fab floosies is due to all the boob flashing  first rad today so my droopy dumplings will be out and about too. Looked in mirror last night and thought no gasps of admiration there then lol. Still got big blue patch from before op and big dent from lumpectomy, good job I ain't vain. Saying which I am a bit, had my nails Gelac treated yesterday  Diamond pink colour. It will stay on hopefully for three weeks, high gloss and they look like false nails but all mine.She came to the house, complete with amazing leather and chrome table, chair and all bits in a small cube shaped block. Took one hour and had a fab manicure first then lots of oils etc then colour. Being pampered is sooooooooooo  good. Saving up for next one as from today. Sorry about deleted posts, didn't think anyone would be looking lol. Our lovely neighbour who is IT savy was helping with pic posting but still a bit off. will try again later. It was pic of bathroom but bit dark so need to fiddle with it. Nihahi, Sergei sends hug back and a BIG SLOPPY KISS too. He is a bit of a one lol No sleep defo not a bit funny, hope meds sort you out, could do with happy meds too. seeing Doc in the morning eyes watering so bad looks like I am crying seems yet another SE !! You get your butt out of that pit or Edi will do the thumping. Your DH is like his wife, very wise. Sigourney Weaver only fought twcbm for 90 mins, you have fought a hell of a battle. Checking out yoga for bc ladies at hospital today, thanks. Scot/Welsh what a cracking heritage. Really weird that your grandpop a Darroch !! A really unusual name and my friends daughter is also a Darroch, Her husbands family own Fort Perch Rock, New Brighton, Merseyside. It is a very old defence fort on the banks of the Mersey River. Give it a google and they do a video of New Brighton from the air, I live ten minutes away. You and she may be distant relatives. Your sister at World Trade, how wonderful she survived on what was the worst day I can ever remember. Agree on searches don't care how long it takes as those sneaky bxxxxxxs hide explosives in places you wouldn't dream of. I had real meltdown too yesterday, DH put on his coat and walked out, first time in 44 years !! I crashed around kitchen yelling and throwing things then sat and pulled myself together like a pair of curtains lol. Bless him he forgave me, I would have slapped me soft if I had been him. Gonna post this bit before it cyber spaces and continue in a min xx",

Got new engineer yesterday, cancelled contract with Gas Board reckon money that costs us saved up will cover any future problems. Nice chap reckons he knows what is wrong and is getting parts for later this week Your DH peeling, ouch what is it about men and sunblock ? I have found the most amazing dry oild spray which my DH WILL use so easy to apply, no rubbing in and he smells yummy like a big coconut. He burns easily and this works so well. He was burnt so badly when we were young that his swim shorts welded into the swollen burnt skin, think that taught him not to do it again. You could spray duracell as he dashes past. Hope you not too depressed now back to normal life and not too wet x Websister, Hope you are having fun and lots of cuddles with teenies. Sods law with Mom, but as Traii says she is in good hands and ok, you need time for YOU too.

Got DH trained when he has had his shower I have a microfibre spone/pad, quick wipe and not a splash mark in sight. Know our bathroom is like a cupboard size wise, compared to all you ladies, but here they don't give up much space for loos. That is why we went for white seems bit  bigger. Shower is over the bath behind the door and that is a new thing. We have walk in one downstairs but saves the sight of DH clanking past on his way to clean up lol. 29 deg sounds lovely as still bxxxxy freezing here. Rads was really good, got into trouble with DH as I looked at the wrong time  on the sheet. We were almost and hour late !! They weren't bothered at all but top of his head almost came off  oops Only good part of chemo is the weight loss for me, hopefully will help my diabetes and make it easier to control. Appetite is returning thank goodness so will have to be careful. Went to my old pub for lunch. Had garlic mushrooms to start ,followed by liver and onions and creamy mash yum, ate most of it and as my old workmate had cooked it, it was delicious. My hair growing great too, GD is like DS she tells everyone and then whips off my wig to show them. Go for the nails, mine feel so pretty now, and even tho normal length have a lovely shine and no lumpy shedding bits. Felt you in my pants pockets wriggling and giggling, Rads was only one young chap  he was the student and was real cute.You would have liked him. The other 5 were all lovely funny ladies, they loved my turban and false fringe and have to take in details of where to get turban for one of the girls. How much longer for your op ? Is break with mum and dad soon ? Really weary and just crashed out for a few hrs. Been up since 5am so might have something to do with it lol. Hope your sleeping is improving and you rest well tonight. x Dakota, Hope cockroach behaved on the days he bothered to show. How's it going with the exterminator ? Hope you are keeping well x Catch up in the morning with all you hooligans lol xxxxx",

DH who's DIY brain never stops decides to put up white blind on landing window. 9 pm we start, him measuring and cutting, me tidying my bedroom drawers as can never find things I really want in the morning. He goes downstairs to cut little more off and suddenly I felt as weak as a kitten  lay on bed and as he comes upstairs I ran to new throne room and everything I had eaten that day came back to haunt me !! He is in bits on the landing thinking it was his fault poor love. After about fifteen mins felt soo much better. Had a shower into pj's and miracle of miracles slept for 7 hrs. yay second rad lunchtime today, then hopefully meeting my friend for coffee in cute village craft centre near hospital, then GD after school. Bliss. Nihahi. Sergei and I worried about you and sending extra big cuddles.Hope you got some zzzz's ? Eagle ahead of you, magical and really good omen. He is bringing you extra strength. Have a glorious day in the mountains with your friend, my best friend coming for a sleepover this week and can't wait. She knows me like no one else, we have been friends for over 60 years so she should do LOL. Glad you like throne room, hope you all don't think I am showing off, just so thrilled that everything around me is improving and it DOES make you feel better. Your poor DH, my DH like him, starts fidgiting when the girls get manhandled by another male.Lets face it if some gorgeous nurse started feeling up his wedding tackle we would be horrified. ( as if ) LOL.x   from Sergei too. Jackie, blessings to you. Read your post to DH, the part where you said you had been Interior Designer. He is sitting there with BIG beaming grin. It was a joint effort, but blind, chrome figure and NO clutter all ME.Thanks for the feed back. Shower room next yay. Hope your girls settling down, when is everything healed ?x Liefie, mainly tupperware gets chucked, I'm not as daft as I look LOL. DH's as you say suffer as much if not more in some ways than us. Mine will weep if it all gets too much but I think that is good and may stop him having a heart attack. His eyes filled with tears this morning at a pic in our local paper. A tiny deer who's Mum won't have anything to do with him, is being reared by his male keeper. In the pic he is on the keepers desk gazing at him and almost kissing him and the keeper obviously adores the tiny creature too. My blind is New York Skyline. Got it to just pull down at night but love it so much it stays there. In the day the sunlight comes thru the skyscraper windows and it is like being there again. Hope you are ok ? You two and your sleeping in, lots of us a jealous on here I am sure. 23 more zaps to go but means to an end and beats chemo into a cocked hat ! X All you sisters hope minimal se's, pain and discomfort today and every day. Namaste.",

Gave me something for the watery/dry eyes and sleeping pills YAY. Just going to take now and again to give me some rest. Finger pain now both thumbs ( weird ) he says not neuropathy just probably as skin is splitting on them to coat them in Germolene at bedtime and put on my glam  ( not ) white gloves.

Good luck with pre op tomorrow, thinking of you x Dakota, how are things ? Hope you are staying strong and wonderful x Liefie, family coming second week sounds sensible, you are bound to feel stronger and less sore then.

Rads at midday then may have small retail fix bits and bobs for hopefully finished shower room Have dreadfully dry skin on hands mainly finger tips  wear rubber gloves for washing up and handcream plus gloves every night. Last night forgot to take up handcream but had a pot of nappycream in meds cabinet, being too lazy to get handcream slapped on uber greasy sudocrem on went gloves and this morning much softer and less sore. Sometimes we find help in the strangest ways. Wrinkly butt due this morning so tummy in a knot re DH, he has suddenly taken to closing each and every door upstairs tight shut. Edi goes up with laundry etc and has to wrestle with really stiff door handles  almost drop the lot !! Ask why ? \" It looks tidier \" Edi roars first time in 42 freakin years you have ever done it !!!!! told to keep voice down in case next door  ( deaf old dear ) hears. GIVE UP LOL. ED in bits again, skyped me with view of her downstairs remo, not a wall left ! Arco props everywhere and thought it looked good. Turns out they have built small back extension wrong size and it now ruins the whole look and footage at the back. Her partner ( future SIL ) is like DH and she is now sorry they ever started. Builder should have liased with them but didnt. Hate to see your kids suffer. Might go and kick a builder or two. Nihahi, Poor love, hope pain easing ? You make sure you rest and nooo more hoovering. Make it DD's special job when she is settled in. You need to look after no 1 sod the rest of them. I am coming around to that mind set but it has taken almost a year to implement. Will look after wrinkly butt, DH will be here before his afternoon shift so will be hovering over him like the angel of death, Edi might do a kick to his butt to keep him away.xx Traii, Lovely that pain subsided, it must have untrapped itself  be careful when bending and try not to lift DS too much to keep it that way. DS AND DH shopping recipe for disaster. You must have the patience of a saint. Think DS would have been my main choice too. have a lovely visit to Aunty's. Weight gain won't make you any less beautiful and your onco is right. Helen I had lunch with yesterday used to throw up for 8 hours after every chemo and that was worse than a bit of extra padding.xx Movie, Goodness you did have a good sleep. You must have needed it. Then you hurl yourself into sooo much activity  impressive. This is a lifeboat we all need, \"C\" is a dirty word to some and on here we all understand and empathise. Hope DD gives those tootsies a rest lol xx Caitlin and Carla how are you today ? xx Websister, hope you are picking up energy wise ? Rads I have been told cause such fatigue for up to three months after they have finished !! Sod that for a game of soldiers, we have to kick this into touch.xx Liefie, bet you are sick of the sight of chick peas lol. Very little cooking for me yay. DH's shift doesnt finish until 9pm so egg on toast will do. Have a wonderful day xx Benny, Rads are great, lots of happy smiling faces in our waiting area. Sure you will breeze through these. BC bitch will be well destroyed xx All you other busy bee sisters, love and joy to you xx Laters x",

Came down to check on you all, and Liefie also flying with cyber hug. Don't let your weight get you down, I have been up to 3 sizes bigger than now and just buy bigger stuff Lol. Sorry it isnt funny but need you to smile.  DH and chocs ! he bought them what does he expect. Chocolate is such a comfort food and you need to be comforted. You are trying your best and sure things will get better. My DH would never consider camping then last year decided to get tent etc. Weather turned yuk so all in his flipping shed neatly stacked. If you feel like a skpe later PM me. DH at work this avo so that would be good if you feel up to it. xx Traii, your DS is a little tinker !! My DS once almost gave me a heart attack, I was looking through a rail of clothes and he was standing next to me, looked down and no more DS !! Ran around the store like a nut case, nothing, ran outside and loo and behold he was across a busy road and playing hopping on and off a shop step. How he got there without being splatted I will never know. Sorry you still not sleeping well, hopefully penguin island will help you break the cycle and rest. Have a wonderful time chick you soooo deserve it. luv u lots xx Nihahi, This time next week, wow. twcbm will be no more  you wont know yourself and the peas will be crying in the freezer. You make sure you look after no 1, DD and DH will be fine, just lie on your recliner like Marilyn in the pic only I think nice comfy pj's bit better than a bikini. lol. Baby bum cream is good think zinc is doing the trick. Only sore skin is on hands, soooo dry and end of fingers keep cracking quite deeply but small price to pay. Rest of body could do with a good ironing but that is just age not rads. Ed and home improvements, defo those programmes have a lot to answer for. She adores one call Grand Designs but of course you don't see all the stress and heartache. She went to house yesterday and they had left her front door unlocked for the second time !! Her partner has said he now wants nothing more to do with it and she can do all the troubleshooting. She is brilliant and knows how she wants it all but the builders seem to be on another page. Your outings sound like my kind of trip, lots of stops and chocolate. xx Movie, BIG HUG hope DD isn't knackering you too much. lots of love xx DH has a gob on again, free shower door was wrong size   wrinkly looked suicidal. DH orders new everything which wrinkly is paying for. Few hours later supplier rings and has found two more doors that might fit. Oh poop, daren't tell wrinkly these would have been free too. I told DH he shouldn't have been so quick off the mark so now he ain't talking to me, ( BLISS ) when he gets up will no doubt get told off for questioning his decision. HELP. GD coming for tea later with ED so we can bitch about our men. Hope GD not in ear shot she will tell them.ha ha. Need more tea, gonna try and nap on sofa. Laters gorgeous girls xx",

Energy level dipped a bit yesterday but could be because DH decided to paint THE SHED and despite expecting a day of peace and pottering for me I was in and out, up and down like a fiddlers elbow !! Don't mind supplying tea but every problem involved me having to find the solution Sorted out my bench in the garden which sits inside an arbour, one of my favourite places. Seat lifts up and all my garden tools and gd's bits and bobs for play in garden there. Then cut fuschia back down to ground, it is a whole bed full and was really exhausting. Have a rest DH says, off Edi goes like a rat down a drain and splatted on sofa.Put in roast when I woke up and that was my day. Today have rads at midday followed by visit to my surgeon. Follow up after op, swear I can find new lumps in boob. Probably nerves ( I hope ). Lefie, glad you picked up, your meal sounded sooo yum. Imagine us lot around your table  what a great event that would be. Will happily sort your garage, do love sorting and organising stuff. Your garage sounds like most peoples cars outside, junk inside. Hope you had a good BIG portion of that food and put feet up, sod the walk lol xx Nihahi, movie right you need to stay safe in house until Friday !! Fall sounds horrendous , hope not too stiff and aching today. Your comment about weather where you are struck a cord. My cousin in Dubai posted on f/b that it was pxxxxxg down there ! His lovely wife has just gone back for a well earned break from her chemo, bet she is not happy.She so wanted some sun.xx Caitlin, Hope se's have subsided, you are getting there,  we all are going through this with you and you are being positive and cheerful despite everything xx Scottie, busy lady, just pop on when you can. ((( HUG ))) xx Websister, Hope MUGA goes well. So much still happening in everyone's life as well as the bxxxh fingers in so many pies, no wonder we are all tired. Do the nap thing to if only to rest weary bones.Twelve days of rads to go for me and dreading the follow on fatigue but at least that part will be over. Hope Benny is getting through them ok. xx Movie, enjoy your posts too. You have become so much more positive and spelling is not as important as hearing from you. How is DD ? hope she has chilled out a bit. Your garage next after Liefie's xx Dakota, try and take it easy before surgery, sure with chicks it isnt that easy. xx Traii, Hope you are having fun xx Need another pint of tea !! All sisters have a good day xxxx",

Johny visited a few times but couple of immodium sorted him out. Popped up to school to give GD some anti biotics at lunch time. They won't do it. Got lovely hug and kiss, she took meds good as gold and Nana slipped some choc buttons into her pocket. ED just been to do the same and was told not to forget the choc buttons or else. Was bit weary last night abd DH watching Footie  ( yuk ) went into back room and curled up under blanket with cushion over ear to block sound of tv in other room. Was in the middle of a cracking sleep and was rudely awakened by DH who wanted the freakin photos of water feature sent and as he can't do it I get the job of asking savvy neighbour to do the job. He came as near to being murdered as he has ever been. He had a bit of a tummy bug so he couldn't leave the house. This morning lots of pleasant workmen arrived, fire been changed for easier to use model. Of course DH found a fault, it wasn't the front he had ordered  thought lovely gas man was going to bash him.It looks gorgeous and Edi likes it so TOUGH !! Got cake order off gas man too. yay. Dakota, how did app go ? According to my calculator won 55 USD.You are amazing and an example to all. Hope you and your girls getting along really well xx Nihahi, Fatigue yuk, hope you feel good soon.Shedman popped in yesterday.

DH had a right mood on because guess what ? not happy with the doors !! lock not right. Had been in mood all day Monday then on my special day was just the same. We get to hospital and I was stressed to bits, Booked in and waited a while, nurse calls me to comfy chair, prescription late so Edi just relaxes DH fidgetting so much I wanted to kick him, sent him for tea and toast from Cafe downstairs. Nurse then arrives and it was the chap who did my FIRST dose.Should have known it would be dodgy, that time ended up with cording to vein. In goes one needle, not to bad he then announces it needs to be removed  and another put in, thought he was coming out the back of my wrist !! He then injects steroids and I felt as if I was having a heart attack, that horrid feeling passed and in went first syringe felt it go up my arm like a rocket, burst into tears and DH looked horrified.Second syringe ok then all done  never had one single chemo before that was so horrid so really won't miss  it, have come to conclusion that men aren't as gentle as ladies lol.  Smile just for camera !! As we left I gave DH what for as my day was going down the pan. Not my fault he is neurotic about workmen. Went for lunch then came home, he chilled out in the garden and I did too. He had promised me a chinese meal out so put foot down and it was gorgeous.I ate more than I have in weeks and DH behaved. Today resting and then GD after school yay, DH working midday so bliss returns. Maria, lovely that you had fun downtown with your sister. Hope your arm improving xx Liefie can'tbelieve you get up at 3.30 and COOK amazing, I was up  that time today due to flipping steroids but cup of tea most I could manage. Bet your friend was thrilled with meal it sounded yummy. Don't you worry about weight, know it's easier said than done but you are gorgeous no matter what size. Spent Monday in Liverpool shopping with  BF and got wedding outfit !! Just the colour I wanted,  dress with little bolero. Need approval from ED and BD or it's going back lol.xx Nihahi, I can assure you I was a vestel virgin for quite some time !! Of course I saw the light and here I am. Will send proof in picture form when I can lol. Glad you got respite from pain eventually .

Great you are getting out and about, you are an inspiration. Know other ladies in same boat as me but hope all these niggles and worries go soon, need to keep busy. Looked on diep thread, some ladies on there seem to have unresolved issues which make them misconstrue things that are said.Bit like flippin face book, as someone said if it is spoken as against written comes over differently.I couldn't see anything that could have caused the problem and the majority of the ladies there seemed to agree. You keep up the good work there, no one else could be as empathic as you dear friend. Hope you get back to sleep. 8am here been up two hours and must get cakes iced soon so fun can begin.

She better get good compensation or there will be another Titanic disaster in the Mersey River. Shedman and family soooo happy, as are all his friends.

My DH found the Breast Cancer Husband by an author called something Silver a great help. I got it off Amazon and it is written by a lovely man who wanted to help his wife and find out things he didn't understand. There are lots of books aimed at ladies but he felt in a cloud like you two. Please keep reading and asking questions if you need too. The cloud will lift soon. Traii hope you get DS worn out, our GD is helping pick up all the branches DH has cut from front tree. Trying to wear her out for her Mum. ED took her to look at a wedding dress she had found and lo and behold she turned into the child from hell. When ED came out in her amazing dress GD was jumping on and off a beautiful pale sofa in the shop. She then proceeded to run around in circles then topped off the lot by wiping her face on the front of the dress !!!! Thank goodness no chocolate involved but ED came home and cried. GD has been told off in no uncertain terms and it is so unlike her. She better behave on the Wedding day lol. Websister, glad you liked the pics  back to normal now thank goodness.Have a wonderful time with the family. Liefie, is your DH of Irish descent ? It seems to be an Irish habit supplying enough food for an army. My darling SIL supplies food for the five thousand even when only a handful there. We all leave laden with food for the next few days lol. Dakota, Glad wedding went well and the insect behaving. My GD's cry buckets when they have to say goodbye to their cousins too. Great news about boobs. Sure these lovely hubbies on here won't mind. Benny, you look amazing on F/B looking back over last years posts, can't believe you are the same person. You have done so well. Are you eating all the things on your list for after burning pipes stopped ? I have found things starting to taste better lately, still can't eat lots, but enough to keep me going.

Now get those knitting needles out.  The young man's suicide attempt so tragic, here two 14 year old's have hung themselves in the past week egged on by a social networking site trolls. What is this world coming to ? English tea party wow what a lovely idea. Bet those scones were fantastic. Glad smelly doggie back home. Laughed at vision of you and DH being pulled by the cops. Nice they let you off.x Maria, How did slumber party go ? Still trying to find you on f/b  x Love to ALL sisters mentioned or not. X",

Reiki does help plus reflex and the spiritual healing, brings on a feeling of calm and peace. Only problem is effect doesnt last, maybe pills will. Will keep you posted.

Being a Nan is like being in a secret society, such fun. Glad sport outings easing for you. You need the rest. X Adagio, hope you all recovered from your trip, must learn more words by heart for next week, love that I am getting something right.X Liefie, Crossing everything that wedding day is blissful for ALL concerned. X Horrible reading how some of you have been treated by employers. It does happen here too. A friend of mine rang where she worked  to say she had been diagnosed with BC, all they asked was when she would be back on her till in the supermarket. She told them to shove their job where the sun don't shine. Know that isn't an option for most people but a bit of empathy would have helped her so much. Slept about four hours last night, think eating cheese late at night NOT a good idea. Love to ALL X .",

Micro story hilarious, you certainly rattled his cage, love it. Last year all DH's pots of paint in the shed froze solid and then was ruined  he was not a happy bunny. Now any spare kept indoors.

Your DH must love the cooking sounds delicious hope roasties go well. I live in Upton !! might even be next door to your friend , who knows.

Websister, have plenty of r and r, you deserve it. Nihahi, I am still cycling, 8 kms a day now with a higher resistance on the bike.acquired a yogapilates DVD too.Feeling less knackered and also did loads of yard work as sun was shining.Hope you are well ? Morwenna, sure your next procedure will be here and over before you know it.Can't believe how much choir lifts my spirits.Yours is doing so well, wow !! Start my training for Headstrong next week and really looking forward to it.Will only be doing once a fortnight helping out but will give me a reason to move forward. love to all x",

Your photo on f/b of you and Paisley is so beautiful.😃 Nihahi, funny to think you are following the golf which is  literally 10 minutes away from my home. Traffic around here pretty grim but only every four years. George Clooney is staying in next village and local ladies are planning how to meet him !! He is in a gated estate and lock picking lessons needed 😏. Our Bingo pub has huge A board outside with last refreshments and toilet stop before the motorway written on it, businesses are doing well 😀. This will amuse you girls it seems they are charging 12 dollars for one cooked sausage at the course refreshment stalls. 😢 now that is a bit much. Local cafes will be doing well but heaven help anyone who doesn't take in their own food/drink. Just like Wimbledon and the strawberries.Hailstones where you are sound horrendous !! Adagio, how are things going  You must be getting excited.😀💒. Choir singing at a wedding this afternoon, rain really bad today 😕 Sang at one yesterday and sun was cracking the flags !!It was such a lovely service until one of the little flower girls dropped a huge box of crayons just as the vicar asked if any one knew a reason not to go ahead. Thought the happy couple were about to faint !! There is a little area where kiddies can sit and draw and read and she knocked them off the table 😬 she did it again later in the middle of a reading by the grooms Mum, not funny.😠 Good luck with mo. Momof,sorry you have to leave your peaceful retreat.Think of you when working in our charity/thrift shop. I come home with all sorts and have to smuggle them in and hide them from DH 😁 had some super bargains. Caitlin, good luck with mo too. You must be worn out with all your travelling. Liefie, Have a glorious time with your beautiful family. 😀 Have to dash and get looking clean and tidy for the wedding, must root out my wellingtons too. Love to all 😍",

Jennie, same for you on the two years. My two years if week after next 😀 Also my second visit to the man who removed it for my check up. Hopefully this time just in and out and a cup of coffee as my reward for being g brave. Momof, need you here !! So much clutter and can't rev up to sort. That shoulder sounds awful. I had frozen one once and that was nasty enough. 9/11 There are no words, just know that here we grieve every year too. A few years before I was on the top of one of the towers on a visit to the big apple. I will never forget the wonderful people we met there, the elevator man who comforted my ED when she felt faint, the lady in the cafe who wished  us a nice day.😢 Nihahi, so glad Movie coming to your get together. Give her a hug from me please. My volunteer work in the charity shop has finished. The lady I worked with has been told that if she continues to do car boot sales she can't work there as well.The lady in question is selling a lot of her personal possessions as her DH is fighting cancer and they are struggling. She took a tiny ornament out of the trash and said she would take it with her, if she sold it she would donate some to the shop but they told her to go. She could have come back after hours and fished it out in the yard but she was up front. Honesty doesn't always pay. I am giving up now as she was lovely to work with and it won't be the same. They are already losing volunteers fast anyway. It has opened my eyes re charity/thrift shops. People drop in bags of lovely things, if the boss is having a busy day she just trashes them to save sorting through ????Will stick to hospital volunteering instead. Rant over, DH gone on his walk 😀😀😀😀 so I am off for some retail therapy. Love to all x ",

Know you want to be out and about but WHOA as you would say to Diamond. I should have been in Liverpool fund raising today with my girls, SEs ( dashing to loo and feeling like a zombie ) made me stop and think, I have done my bit for the last few weeks and now my body needs to be rested and pampered a bit. They will raise lots without me and don't want to have to pick me up off the floor in the middle of it all.lol Wish you were nearer I would make you some of my homemade veggie soup, and come and boss you about just be thankful you are the other side of the planet. X Alice, hope you are well. x Liefie, you are right in that the slightest thing knackers you, we all think it won't do it to us but our bodies are full of chemicals what on earth do we expect ?

You must be sooo excited about South Africa, how long are you in the air ? x Carlads, Sure you will be besides yourself with worry about Tuesday but you WILL be great. You are facing this all with great courage :-) We will all be walking into that theatre alongside your trolley carrying your armour ready to strap it back on for the next battle.

My DH says he fancies me more than ever with baldy head ! Considering we have been together almost 50 years find that most encouraging lol X Traii , Cyber Baby, How you doing ? The hail defo scarey !! Hope you didn't try that on your bare head. lol.Did you finish the cake ? Even tho felt like crap yesterday made cake for my friend with face of Animal from I think it is Sesame Street on it. Anyway he has orange hair and plays the Drums. It turned out pretty good even tho I do say it myself. That is his present for Birthday today. :-)). Hope SE's minimal, my next chemo now 18th Dec so  you will be behind u all :-((.

Flanalette sheets, haven't had them for years but need new bedding so think i will invest in them this time. Hope yours fluff up really well. The temperature where you are makes here look like Barbados ! We Brits are real whimps. Some of my family live in Toronto and when they tell us how geared up you all are for bad weather conditions we are green with envy. Keep on getting stronger. ( big hug ) X",

They lowered my dosage last time and I was much better. Honestly think it's a bit of trial and error. Never crossed my mind that less of it meant it wouldn't work. You are a real worry pot. Think positive thoughts at all times don't be a cup half empty girl, cup is half full !! Websister is truly our Wise Woman. Just enjoy the time before next chemo as she says spinach soup sounds gorgeous, lots of nourishment, lots of fresh if icy cold air and defo snuggles with Diamond. I believe animals have healing powers and she wants her Mom to get better real soon. Keep up the good work beautiful Benny we are your family wether you like it or not lol X Websister, you are a woman after my own heart. I am packing in as much fun and laughter as possible before 3rd chemo next Tuesday. Had great time at Bingo this afternoon. Early xmas dinner, yummy. few drinks. tons of laughter and I won £ 100.00 GBP with a full house plus bottle of wine for DH.! Going away for weekend of 60's music with dear friends so if I feel yuk after chemo will have lots to look back on. Hope your Mum still ok and you too. X Dakota, how are your little bundles of joy ? Bet they are besides themselves with excitement about Xmas. X Traii cyber baby girl, Edi on her way to kick ass. Can't believe that nurse didn't put your gloves in the freezer after all !!! Bxxxh. Glad the rest of it wasn't to bad. Still perishing here but not as bad as Canada. Brrrr. This CMF is tablets as well isn't it ? Onc dept said they will explain more about it nearer the time. I am doing very good impersonation of an ostrich, if I put head in sand it will all go away lol. Hope SE's minimal for you this time X Bearcub, Lesley,and all other Warrior sisters keep up the great advice it helps each and everyone of us. I have eyes like pee holes in snow, think I need to lay down my baldy head. Wooly hat going on for bed, that and the bedsocks along with thick fleecy pj's complete the look of a goddess. Hugs for all of you. Edi x",

First chemo is stepping into the unknown, after that it just becomes something you have to get through.Know you won't believe it but I now almost enjoy the experience, you may see the same faces having their treatment and the nurses go out of their way to put you at ease. The comfy chair is just that, a vehicle to hold you safe and comfortable while the treatment happens.x Traii, Will be with you tomorrow.

Nihahi is right you must be sensible, I have too learnt a lot from websisters list. Think my \" ring of fire \" may also be a bit similar to what you have ie. inflammation of tissues. It is burning from tummy right through to nether regions now and not running to loo. Going to get a few things from the list today and cut back on coffee etc. Did you try the baked egg custard ? It couldn't be softer or more slippery to swallow. I put touch of sweetner in as I can't have sugar. You are then getting milk and eggs at least.Just add 2 eggs to half a pint of warm milk,add sweetner and vanilla essence if you have it. pop into buttered dish. place dish in tray of water and bake for 1-1 1/2 hrs in oven on no 1. so easy and I am going to make one for my tea tonight as this burning is travelling up to middle of my chest right now. I also love a ripe banana mashed with a fork and mixed with evaporated milk. Used this on babies when they were starting to eat and they still adore it. Glad LGFB was good so looking forward to having one of these, Benny must have thought you were a walking picnic of cream when you got into bed lol. If you are googling, look up story of chief baker of the TITANIC.his story is quite amazing . Just concentrate on getting energy levels up, the rest will follow. Hope Radiologist went ok. x Carla, getting hair cut best thing you can do, if it gets very sparse I found getting it buzzed right off made me look and feel even more in control.Wig fits better and when it grows back will be nice and even. Don't fret too much about constipation, it might not happen. I only had it once and lots of fluids and fruit sorted it. I am also hitting the activia today.x Liefie, how lovely to have you back safe and sound. How did the wedding go and your playing ? x Bevlee, picture great you look super.

I find things do taste different and texture too seems weird. Gone right off bread as like chewing a bath sponge lol. Sure all this will pass and in the meanwhile I have gone down TWO sizes in slacks that is good, as needed to lose weight, hope it stays off. As you will have seen I love baking soda and find it really soothing  end of my tongue feels as if it has a spot about to erupt but sure this too will pass. You are doing great, I find now I crave food with strong flavours, going to have baked beans with cheese grated on the top and maybe bit of garlic. I was on epirubicin and that does dry everything out, think most chemo's do. Sometimes sit watching tv with tongue in glass of iced water, not a pretty sight lol. Also found gentle brushing of tongue with the tongue cleaner on the back of toothbrush helps. Headshaving party fab idea ! May as well raise funds out of what will also make you feel more comfy. Just be gentle with your hair in the meantime then it will last .x Luvmy, google rocks !! I gently cook a chopped onion in a little butter, when going clear add a couple fresh tomatoes ,quartered, cook for a few minutes. Then add sweetheart cabbage cut up quite small and freshly washed so drops of water still on it. Put lid on pan and cook on gentle heat until cabbage softens. Take off lid, add ground black pepper and stir all together. ( add cooked bacon if you want ) sooo tasty.All cooks without any extra liquid just the water off the cabbage.x Nihahi, Brits and snow !! don't go there, we have the worse systems in the world, a few years ago all the powers that be ran out of grit for the roads, now that was bad.Shops also sold out first day it fell. DH has lots of it in his shed which we bought when stocks came in after it all melted. My uncle lived in Toronto and on his visits here used to fascinate us with how it doesn't stop everything there. If it costs money here, they won't do it, simple.We may do good pomp and ceremony and olympics but looking after our roads in bad weather NO.x Gonna cook me up a mess of beans, love and hugs to you all xx",

DH and I did same as you for most of weekend, lovely, just a little shopping thrown in but at least not as chilly here. Chemo is a long journey but watching how younger women on here cope fills me with awe. We are warriors and will get there and laughter is the best medicine, that and all the advice and support from you and other sisters keeps us all going. Love you xx ",

Mainly veggie and I cook boiled rice chinese style as it is foolproof, even DH can do it lol. What did you have to eat, a banquet or do you have a favourite ? Now I am hungry again lol.

How's the hair ? I look like a porcupine with a crew cut, defo growing back. Nails are like concrete too, have never had strong nails but now could use them as little daggers lol x Dakota, hope you had a fab weekend but didn't overdo it x Barbara, glad you came back to us. Sisters have so much knowledge and experience, Google is a no no honestly. I did just that and was in bits then found this place and now relax and if in doubt ask the girls. You will be on here very soon chatting away comparing experiences and side effects and wondering why you were so afraid.Great strides have been made in BC treatment and my nurse said that if you have to have a cancer  BC is the one to have because of this. I started the book I recommended yesterday to you and it is fascinating. Will help you too. x Lesleyann,luvmy.liefie, carla, caitlin, jennie and  all sisters hope you are all moving forward. Off to prepare for the party, when all I want to really do is feet up and read lol xx",

You just be you, BC attacks your whole feminine being. I had a lumpectomy and even though I am 65 when I look in the mirror still get a shock at the dent in boob. Our beautiful sisters who have mastectomies are incredible and to be honest if they had said I needed that I would have asked for a double. You feel as if your body has betrayed you by allowing this thing to grow inside you but if you have had lumpectomy with clear margins that is so positive no matter what they say is next just say \" ok bring it on \" astound your love ones with how brave and positive you are and then when no one is around, cry, throw things, kick the cat ( joke ) and vent that way. If you feel yuk tell them !! Pull the BC card and use it to get rest and sympathy. Also and I know this is hard to do, get your DH and get away even if just one night, have a lovely meal, stay somewhere special and try and have fun. I did and it really helped me face the next part. My daughter booked us a break in a swanky hotel,  told them about me and we got the honeymoon suite !! Laughed until  we cried but it was lovely.x Websister, arm got me through today with no pain or tightness. Going to do moist heat again tonight before bed just to keep it like that. My DH sends his thanks to you as well. Hope Mum's move doesn't happen while you are having treatments. Snowflakes on eyelashes how lovely and snap with the prickly head.x Nihahi, hope you got that long walk and cleared the cobwebs. Here is so much warmer so may drive down to New Brighton and walk along the promenade tomorrow. You are so right about those Movies too. Doom and gloom. Love it if someone made a positive one where heroine kicks BC's butt and lives to be 100. But know that isn't box office.x Dakota, Glad you ok, slow down now and chill a bit x Benny, please please be ok ? x Just demolished huge roast dinner, felt really hungry the past few days will soon be filling out those slacks again lol.

So need a new one. Traii, baby girl so proud of you, sorry to hear this one was a pincushion job. My first one was fine except for you lot talking about rude things, in loud voices, in my pockets. I was trying not to giggle. I waited nearly four hours, they had me down to see Doc by mistake.By the time they realised I had been there that long DH was not a happy bunny. Told him next time just drop me off and pick me up, can't cope with the negativity. Wish Dad happy birthday from me. Hope you had a great public holiday could just imagine DS's face at all the fun on the beach. Start tablets this morning, will neck the water thanks. So far no se's but hoping it stays that way. As nurse gave me flush and anti sickness iv I had the most awful sensation that I had peed myself ! I hadn't thank goodness but she said that can happen and I must tell them to do it more slowly next time. She also said she hadn't had anyone thank her for their treatment  before, honestly manners cost nothing. Hope you have a lovely day, off to Bingo then GD for tea. Joy oh joy lol x Nihahi, Hot choccy yum, I have cocoa with no sugar, DH has the choc, so weary last night took them up to bed  put mine on his bedside table by mistake and low and behold he drank mine !!! I can't have his due to sugar, he was nearly wearing it but guess who would have to change the bed ? I too change dimensions on photos, hope Carla sorts hers soon. I nuked the peas the other day by the way. Keep up the walking etc, I am still reving up to it.x scottiee, Baking soda brilliant underarms, bless you. x Bearcub, hope that dripping nose getting better.Glad you like the wigs.I love pixie cut too, don't do messing about with hair, even when I have it lol x Bevlee, LOVE the video, hope everyone else watched it. I had just come home from chemo tired and hungry. Logged on, clicked on it and it really lifted my spirits. As it finished guess what ? The exact same song was playing on my kitchen radio ! What are the chances of that. Some people and their comments !! Heartless baaaaad. But you wonderful head shave ladies out weigh him by showing their love x Liefie, hope all going ok with you. Did the kids move go ok ? Swans are magical. Once saw the most beautiful wedding cake with two swans, necks entwined on the top tier. Asked why and was told that as they pair for life the most apt for that cake.x Websister, Thanks for pocket visit, know you tried to control them but hey ho. Looking at that deod too. You are so lovely trying to contact Benny. All I pray is that she is in Hospital and safe. Thank you for asking about my friend, she is out of hospital now and has a new chemo regime starting this afternoon. She had bladder cancer which has now spread to her lungs,bones and liver. Her last three chemo's ,she passed out so they are now trying something else.She is so brave and positive and always says \" what will be will be \" Please God that will be a cure. x Carla, hope you are ok ? se's not too bad. x Dakota you wear me out too. Had two GD's here the other day for a few hours and needed a lie down when they had gone ! Hope you are ok x Luvmy, Kale a new one on me too. Must look into it. Making slimmers world carrot and coriander soup today for DH. Always think the stuff in a can has funny after taste.x Hope I haven't missed out to many of you. Love to you all Edi X",
