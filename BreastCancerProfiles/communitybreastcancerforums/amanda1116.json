There is no true other way of diagnosing either benign or malignant disease other than pathology and pathology always requires biopsy.  That applies to virtually ANYTHING, not just breast cancer. The myth of spreading disease as a result of surgery or biopsy is a very old one and does not originate with breast cancer, it originated with neurosurgery in the 1940s and 50s.  There was an old saying that \"you're never the same when the air hits your brain\" They meant brain tumor resection which, at that time, was in its infancy (read John Gunther's DEATH BE NOT PROUD if you don't believe me). Patients were \"never the same\" back then because neurosurgery was so primative (in some cases still is). So don't worry about that as a reason for any sort of spreading disease -- at all!!! ",

The entire papilloma was taken out at the time of biopsy but the standard here (in NYC) is to excise the duct and examine the tissue surrounding it for cancer, atypical cells etc.  I'm thankful beyond world to say that the the papilloma and all of the tissue around it was completely benign as the radiologist(s) and BS thought it would be.  Amen to that. The \"worst\" part of it was the wire location at my radiologist's on the morning of the surgery. And it was truly not even that bad.  The area was in a difficult location to get to very near the nipple and wire location is done via mammogram.  They had to do it three times to locate it perfectly, which they did.  The needle and wire are tiny and really do not hurt at all.  My poor radiologist had to sit on the floor under the mammo machine to get it right.  They work with my BS all the time (same hospital NYU Medical Center) and he is very exacting and very demanding.  I get the feeling one centimeter off and this guy flips out.  He is actually a very nice and hilariously funny guy (a funny breast surgeon, just what we all need -- but we do) except he is serious as they come in the o.r.  One tip they will tell you at the wire location: DO NOT LOOK DOWN while they are doing it.  That is not so you won't flip out: that is because if you do, your breast will move in the mammo machine. The surgery for me was honestly not a big deal.  I had it under a local and it took all of 20 minutes.  I didn't even have or want sedation.  I was a wreck from the time I had the MRI to through the biopsy and before the surgery but when it came time to have it, I basically just wanted it over and done. I've known my surgeon for 20 years (since I had a fibro in my early twenties which he biopsied -- it was very large and they only took a slice to look at -- completely benign) and he was kind enough to throw his weight around over at pathology and get the report and slides within 24 hours after the surgery so I could be done with all of this. Other than the stress factor, there is no horrible part to any of this.  It is multi step to err on side of caution, but single papilloma is pretty simple. be aware though that the tiny incision around the nipple can ooze fluid for up to two weeks while it heals. This is often because of where it is located and the fact that the weight of the breast is behind it (and I am only a B cup).  Wear a bra as much as you can after the surgery. even sleep in one for a few days to reduce pressure on the area that was operated on.  They will tell you that.   I actually found that the only tricky part of it is taking a week of precautionary antibiotics afterwards.  I am allergic to pennicillin and I had to take Clindamycin. That is one big gun antibiotic.  I had luckily taken it a year ago when I had my first and much more awful than this root canal to get rid of the infection (which is actually very dangerous) before the root canal.  I had never even heard of Clindamycin before and looked it up (of course) online since I am the world's biggest cyberchondriac and what I read about potential side effects shocked me  out of my head.  I didn't get any of them so when I had to take it again this past week, I was fine with it. Do though take the antibiotics even if you are very antt-antibiotics (like me). Good luck with this: I hope it is really easy for you!  I know that due your other medical issues, you will need a different standard of care than I had but I am praying that the results are exactly the same: B9 as they are almost always with papilloma! ",

That's just the way it goes: humans are not as advanced as this particular technology yet. It is very sensitive and not very specific (unlike mammo and sono which are specific and not all that sensitive.  That said, it can find problems at their eariest and most curable and treatable stages.  Have you asked why MRI -- are you high risk?   I have had 3 MRIs (I am high-ish risk) and 3 biopsies and all were benign.  My radiologist told me that 85% of MRI findings are indeed benign.  Good luck with this and try to stay calm and believe me I know how hard that is -- very.   The MRI itself is not a huge deal at all.  It's a bit loud (they give you earplugs or music) but it's not painful (ie mammo) at all.  No squeezing.  Results are usually read very quickly.  Try to make sure you go to a DEDICATED MRI site.  That means if you need an MRI guided biopsy it can be done there.  I hope all turns out really really perfectly for you!!!  Ask me anything about breast MRI.  Due to my own insistence I know it all.  Amanda ",

That's the key issue evidently and certainly easier said than done.   I've only had one genuine panic attack (I panic like everyone else, but an attack is different) and that was when I was a sophomore in college.  It seemed to have arisen out of nowhere: I woke up one morning in my dorm terrified with all of the symptoms of a panic attack.  I believe I must have had a nightmare and while I didn't remember the dream, I assume it was very frightening. The attack subsided after a few minutes in it's own but that was so long ago and I still remember how horrible it was.   So I feel for you and anyone who has them: it's as though for the person having an attack time has stopped and there is no way out while it is happening.  The good news is that the do subside and with meds may even be avoided! I will tell you one thing that worked for my daughter and perhaps it will help you (maybe not).  My daughter is the least panic-y person I have ever met (she is in 11th grade) but she is also one of the top womens saber fencers in the country.  At big competitions, she would win bouts all the way to the last few at the top and start to panic.  She's win, but anxiety, anxiety and this is in no way an anxious kid or athlete.  At least until she reachd the upper echelons of American fencing she wasn't.  A friend of hers, who is an Olympic saber fencer suggested that she see a sports psychologist he had worked with and she did. The sports psychologist was totally nice, very professional and incredible well credentialed. Most of what he discussed with my daughter both she and I found a bit simplistic.  Nothing that she could not have learned on the internet without paying a small fortune.   The one thing he did for her that really did work, however, was something I personally found so outdated and during it's time in the 1970s and 80s trendy and meaningless: biofeedback.  But perhaps I was judgmental and wrong because that now outdated remedy worked for my daughter for whatever reason.  After X number of sessions, she was never anxious at a fencing competition again.  Maybe she would have gotten over it on her own, but this speed it up.  I'm certainly not here to recommend it to others suffering anxiety, but it did work for her -- and I was shocked that it did since everything else the sports psychologist suggested basically made her laugh more than fixed the problem.  It really did work.",

The mammo by the way has never seen a single abnormality (knock wood) and I have been having them since the age of 26 (20 years) I hate all of it and was and am a basket case for weeks before each mammo or MRI.  I seriously once was so thrilled that my mammo was A-OK that I pranced out of my doctor's office through what I thought was an open door which was a thick glass closed door, crashed into it head first, and got a concussion.   That is how out of it I am before during and after mammo (or MRI) day, week and month.  Scary That said we are so lucky to have technology like digital mammography and MRI.  Quite simply, they save lives.  Maybe yours or mine oneday.  If you can afford it and can bear the stress, I say go for it.  I am seriously the most freaked out breast care patient I have ever me and even I just grit my teeth and go through this crap.  My radiologist (who is wonderful) told me I have young daughter, if I am not doing this for me, do it for her and just suck it up.  Never a truer word was spoken.  By the way, you posted this yesterday, November 16th, which is my daughter's birthday :) :)",

Many radiologists ask for additional films when films are not clear or areas of the breast within that film are not as defined as they would like.  Tissue can overlap other tissue obscuring the film. It's happened to me many many times (I go to a radiology practice and the MD is right there looking at the digital pix a second later).  Once I could have sworn my breast wasn't compressed tightly enough in the machine and sure enough it wasn't: redo.  Once they took six pictures of one breast and I freaked out of course.  My radiologist came in afterwards and said no no you're fine: the picture just wasn't clear enough until the tech \"spread\" your breast in the machine.  Hope this is of some help!  ",

There are many completely b9 conditions that should be removed completely so they do not recur and patients do not find themselves having more biopsies for same issue later.  The only person who can do this is a breast surgeon, so don't let his or her job title freak you out at all even after a b9 biosy.  Not all b9 conditions become a surgical recommendation, but many -- maybe most I can't say -- do.  And there are few radiologists who will not refer to a breast surgeon for most issues: it's their jobs on the line if they don't.  That is their responsibility and I think we have to respect that.  That is the drawback to medicine today and it's a legal issue.  I hope all goes really for you and that you remember that most breast masses and nodules are benign: about 80% on mammo and ultra and as many as 90% on MRI (which will pick of everything and cannot really differentiate as to what is what as all enhances with contrast thus the false positive rate is very high: remember though that false positive is false positive for breast cancer, not for benign conditions)   Hope this helps.

I would use the word \"aggrieved\" -- doctors and almost anyone else knows that when you use this it is often a precursor to legal action. If you do not receive an adequate response in writing or by phone, feel free call either your local AMA division or the local radiology board and forward your letter.  You should DEFINITELY seek a second opinion if you feel the first opinion was superficial or may have overlooked any aspect of your initial complaint. Reading of uncaring medical professionals just horrifies me.  Any subspecialty of medicine is meant to be more than a job, it's meant to be a vocation.  Bad doctors are not only the ones who make horrible mistakes, they are those that do not care. Hippocrates said it best: \"first do no harm\" Harm in this case is a patient who feels their needs were not met!  Good luck and good thoughts to you ",

Even a soccer ball or gym class can indeed cause an injury!  Seriously, if you don't feel you want to discuss this with your mother or others in the family right now, do see your school nurse.  Perhaps she can help you to address this with either your mom or your pediatrician.   Good luck.  You're a smart, brave girl to visit this site with your questions and lots of girls your age wouldn't even think to do so so I hope you are proud of yourself. And Carly don't keep Googling your symptoms without some real medical advice.  Anyone here will tell you that is a very bad mistake...",

Did it, and surprisingly, so little pain or discomfort afterwards.  Biopsy results: another very tiny fibroad, no problem,case closed.  My breast isn't even bruised Right side yesterday: nodule much tinier near nipple.  Biopsy easy but OMG what huge bruising and it hurts a lot.  Biopsy just back:  tiny papilloma.  Not cancer but it must be taken out by my breast surgeon.  Small problem: radiologist feels she may have removed the whole thing (it was that small) when she did the biopsy.  Meeting with breast surgeon on Tuesday morning.  Oddly I have known him and his family for 26 years ever since at like 20 I had and had removed, a fibroadenoma.  Actually more like a biopsy: it was huge and he didn't want to take the whole thing for fear of making me completely lopsided.  It turned out both medically and aesthetically fine. Been seeing him regularly ever since. I hear papilloma and of course went nuts but the trusty radiologists + internet have quickly assuaged my fears. This too shall be resolved (very soon if I know my breast surgeon) -- the medical part.  But I need help, no joke.  All of what drives me is related to my mother's death from breast cancer AND the fact that if I see one more pink display in the media I will flip out.  I am DELIGHTED that women and medicine have made such progress with breast cancer -- 1000000000%  What I am not delighted about is how damaging the chatter has really been to someone like me.  It has taken me all these years and this board really to understand that I have post traumatic stress and it's not going away until I choose to do something about it and I'm on it now.  I will not spend another ten days like the last ten days, it is so damaging to every aspect of my existence.  I am yes also seriously going to be thinking about prophy bi lat mastectomy and immediate recon and discussing that with breast surgeon (and plastic surgeon who he works with who is fabulous and one of the biggest jerks I have ever met: one of those Dr. Park Avenue Board Certified guys that I know too well: I used to own a huge medical pr firm and half the clients were clones of this dud. Ah yes, get the guy on Good Morning America to discuss his famous short scar facelife and he's God.  Yuck.  If I go this route I suppose I have to grit teeth and bear it.  This guy really likes me for some reason.  I think it is my bone structure I dodged the bullet in bc three times in two years and you know what: I may have done enough bullet dodging to last lifetime on this subject.  Now I have to recover from all of this and do some work on my head. The most amazing thing about my recent journey was something my best friend from high school said to me.  Her best friend from college had breast cancer at 43 and honestly believes it was stress induced and that stress will always contribute to any disease.  Perhaps she is correct, I cannot say.  What I can say is that my belief is that the stress I feel from the entire subject of breast cancer is going to make me sick.  A kind of weird concept: stress causes illness and so does the stress of fear of illness.   Anyhoo, thank you all for being there for me and not saying \"You'll be fine\" like the other 200 people I know and am related to did.  I will be fine but only when I commit to getting rid of this wolf constantly beating down my door!!

I live in New York and go to a practice that is FANTASTIC except they take NO INSURANCE at all.  They read everything right away with you there except the MRI which takes an hour or so and they call you so fast. You need to find a practice like that if the wait time makes you crazy (it would make me insane, I am not joking) And you have to be okay with paying for it and then submitting.  You will probably not get back your entire fees because as we all know in healthcare destroyed America \"customary and reasonable\" for an insurer seems to have little bearing on what is charged.  I actually believe it or not went two (TWO -- miracle of miracles) without getting called back.  That was after yearly MRIs that always requires (B9 thank goodness) biopsies and an open surgery for a papilloma that wasn't there because it was taken out completely along with the surrounding tissue at the biopsy the week before...it's never ending.  Thing is you're here and it sounds like you are doing well and that is what is important.
