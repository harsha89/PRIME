As I understand it, the prognosis is as good as it can be (tumor is just over 1 cm, ER/PR positive, HER-2 negative, and no apparent lymph node involvement). I've been alternating between sheer terror and moments of relative calm. Mostly the terror thing. I can usually remain optimistic but am really struggling with this. I've been more or less unable to find the bright side, even though people keep telling me all the news so far is good. Working on it, but it is hard. Thank God I had a Xanax prescription, at least I've been able to get some sleep! Anyway, I'm wondering if there are \"rules\" for forming a treatment team. I have talked with two surgeons, who both told me lumpectomy with radiation would be an option. Surgeon A was okay, but I really liked Surgeon B. After talking with her, I felt calmer and more myself than I had since I was diagnosed...which is worth a lot. I would like to go with her for the surgery. What I'm wondering about is, does that mean I have to use the radiologists and medical oncologists who are associated with her, or could I use the ones at the Surgeon A's practice? The other people at Surgeon A's come very highly recommended to me\u2014I know a number of people who were treated there, but none who were treated at Surgeon B's\u2014and after all, I'm going to be seeing the radiologist and oncologist a lot more than the surgeon. (Surgeon A is highly recommended as well, but I would be much more comfortable with Surgeon B working on me.) Plus, I know the oncologists at Surgeon A's specialize in breast cancer, which is also worth a lot to me. A friend recommended that I talk to a couple of medical oncologists after the complete pathology report comes back, which would seem to imply that I can go with whoever I want, but I didn't think to ask her. My husband seems to think I have to stick with all one practice. So what's the deal? Log in to post a reply",
