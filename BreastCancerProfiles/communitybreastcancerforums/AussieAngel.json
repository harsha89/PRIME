It has been there for the past two months but it didnt just appear out of nowhere. It was almost like it was just getting closer to the surface, it was a gradual thing where the color got darker, not just appearing one day as a bruise would. It has grawn a bit, but not alot. It isnt sore to touch, but it was worrying my a little. They always feel kind of lumpy, but i believe that is just because im young, but im not sure. I had told myself it was nothing and tried to put it to the back of my mind, but last night at my 18th birthday party my grandmother mentioned that my dads sister has breast cancer.  Am i silly for worrying?
