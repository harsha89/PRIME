I had a DMX with reconstruction a little more than 2 weeks ago; recovery is going fairly well,except for a horrible feeling of binding or restriction in my chest-which I assume is the tissue expanders. Does this feeling get better, or is this the new norm? Is this normal? It's so annoying-it feels like I have the most hideously uncomfortable bra on!! Thx",
