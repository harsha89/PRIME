It took about a month for me to completely dry up. Then yesterday, I sqeeuzed what looked like breast milk form my right breast and it only came out of one duct, so I'am panicking! Then I got clear fliud to come out of my left breast and it to only came out of one duct. I'am so scared. I'am going to see the doctor next wednesday. Anyone have a similar experience ? So far today I have not been able to get anything to come out of either of them. I'am just so scared because I'am only 23. Help! Log in to post a reply",
