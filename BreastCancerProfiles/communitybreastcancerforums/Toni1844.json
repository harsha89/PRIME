I had a difficult time because I woke up during the procedure and they had to rush to numb me up. I think I would have been better off doing it with the local to begin with. He got so nervous that he didn't stitch it right and I almost lost it. The good side of it is..I had no veins left and no chemo options that didn't require a port left.  I don't have the power port, but I do have it accessed and they hand inject my CT scans and MRIs.  They refuse to do pet scans through it because the stuff wouldn't flush good enough through it? Wishing  you well with yours...I am glad I have it...request emla cream to put on it before they access it and you will never feel a needle stick again.  =0) ",

For some reason my onc decided to go back to abraxane/avastin instead.  I did this combo from Jul. 07- Nov. 07 with great results.  I am not sure if I was progressing on it at the end because I had to get off due to high BP/bleeding issues.  My tumor markers were starting to rise a little but my dosages had been lowered the last month. My question is...my onc says it's ok to reuse a drug that worked well as long as there wasn't significant progression on it and that it has been at least 12 months since its use.,,,has anyone else been told that?  Have drugs been successfully reused for any of you? I have 6 tumors in the liver by last scan and extensive bone mets.  I have a lingering cough from walking pneumonia that I had over a month ago. I don't get scans again until August.  I'm getting kind of scared that if this doesn't work, I will be too far gone. Hope to hear from some of you soon. Thanks and Be Well.

I was told I have more than 20 tumors in my liver after having bone mets only for the last 4 years.  I went at first thinking I had only 1 tumor and was going to get it radiated using Novalis, only to be told I have so many and not a candidate for that anymore. Now I am told that they want to use tomotherapy radiation and give my lower lobe a low dose to slow down the tumors there while giving the larger tumors higher, targeted rads to kill them? At the same time they said they would radiate my L1-S1 for pain as well. It sounds like an awful lot of radiation and my med onc is not happy with me for considering it, but I am about out of chemos to try and I have young kids.  I don't know what to do either. Have you ever had rads to the liver before or know anyone who has? Really looking for some advice here. Thanks. Toni",

I am supposed to start treatment Feb. 3rd and told that I can go right back to chemo as soon as they are done? I had the rads to the mid-spine for pain and ended up w/ pneumonitis too. The side effects scare me. They told me I now have nodes in my neck lighting up too but don't seem concerned about those? Is your rads for pain or to decrease your tumor burden? I currently take navelbine and the stomach issues are bad. Can't wait to be even more nautious from them messing with my liver. Toni",
