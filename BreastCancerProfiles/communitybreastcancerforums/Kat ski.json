I have been taking biotin since then but no results.  This is the second time around for me.  I wear a baseball hat when I go out.  I am so frustrated about this hair growth.  My hair use to grow so much that I would have it trimmed every 8 weeks.  I have no bangs to speak of and I am so impatient.  The last time with this timeline I had hair growth of 4 inched with bangs.  ugh ugh  Any suggestions?",
