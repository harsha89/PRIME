      "Content": "Feb 14, 2015 07:40PM - edited Feb 14, 2015 08:00PM by LaurenElizabeth From the age of 17, I had 8 incisional biopsies and several core needle biopsies. I had one Breast MRI, which was torture due to my anxiety and bad back/knee/shoulder. In Oct 2013, I bit the bullet and took the BRCA test after my uncle passed from Prostate cancer. My mother, grandmother, great aunt and 2nd cousins had breast cancer. All but my mother died from BC. My mother died of Ovarian Cancer. I was diagnosed as BRCA 2 in November of 2013. After knee replacement in November 2013 and 6 week recovery, I began searching out a gynecologist oncologist to do the removal of my tube and ovaries (I had a LSH to remove my uterus in 2006). I had the oomphrectomy and salpingectomy in May 2014 followed by a prophylactic mastectomy with sentinel node testing in June 2014. I wanted to reconstruct using the Diep procedure but my BMI made it too risky. So I had to go with implants. I just had final fat grafting, nipple and touch-ups done yesterday. Due to the new knowledge of my BRCA 2 status, my original breast surgeon wanted another MRI. Unfortunately, some meds hurt my kidney function and the radiologist said MRI was out. So we did an ultrasound and it showed so much junk, it was impossible to read. So we took the 5 most worrisome areas and had core needle biospies. I was shot eight times, which is crazy, but I didn't want to come back (a 112 mile drive). I was bruised for a month. This is NOT usual. In the end, I decided to get it all out. I'm on the back side of it now and I'm relieved I didn't wait until I had cancer. The return rate for BRCA 2 cancer is very high. As I said, I had 8 incisional biopsies, all benign. We tried hard to avoid the last three. Prior to my BRCA diagnosis, we were watching two lumps that looked benign. I always saw top tier breast specialists after the third or fourth time. I had one removed that was large and embedded in my chest wall. I could feel a slight indentation but it really didn't show. All but one was reached using a cut around the areola. This lead to my not keeping my nipple during reconstruction as the blood supply was compromised in that area. The important thing is the surgeon get good margins. That's why I did my homework and went to the best breast surgeons in my plan, even if I had to travel. They are usually done outpatient and I have been known to go to the movies and dinner that night. I hit my $3000 out of pocket in 2014. It came to $3500 as office visit co-pays aren't included under my plan. All my surgeries have been covered, except for co-pays and deductibles. I'm glad I finally took the BRCA test as it was time. I picked a year where my out of pocket costs were already paid due to the knee replacement. So it cost nothing out of pocket. It is a relief to know what I was fairly sure was the case. I do not regret being proactive, although it has been a trial. Hope someone can benefit from my journey.",
