Has anyone had the same GI symptoms that I've had with the AC treatment?  I haven't had either diarrhea or constipation, but I have had pain across my midsection just below my navel.  This lasts for several days, starting a few days after treatment.  It's almost like a crampy pain, and immodium seems to help somewhat.  Any thoughts/suggestions? Over the last 3 treatment cycles, I've found that it's best to sleep when I can over the first week.  I feel much better the second week. Only one more AC treatment to go, then 4 T (every 2 weeks), weekly Herceptin, AI, more surgery, and radiation.  The main course of treatment won't be complete until November.  It seems endless, but day-by-day will get me there.  This will be the year of the lost summer, I guess. Great news that lots of you are starting to get to the end of your treatment!!",

My husband is under extreme emotional stress from trying to help his daughter deal with this.  We onlly told her this week, and she is scheduled for a visit with us this weekend.  She lives in a great group home otherwise.  Since she has a really hard time dealing with illness in others, we aren't sure whether the visit will go smoothly.  We've explained that the hair loss (expected in about 2 weeks) is a sign that the medicine is working and making me better.  But I know that it will be a hard time over the next 6 months for both her and my husband.   He's showing signs of stress where it alwas shows up, with various stomach ailments as well as acute hypochondria, She's showing signs of avoidance of me.  It has to get better. I wish that you and your family, especially your autistic son, find the strength and equanimity to deal with your treatment positively.  If you have any special tricks or suggestions, please let me know.

Started losing my hair yesterday (Day 15) and it's coming out even more today.  Already have a wig, a side/back partial wig, and a few hats and scarves, to prepare for the inevitable.  They may actually look better than my regular hair, which is straight and fine.  Had a friend cut my hair shorter, but probably not short enough.  She was scared of what it would look like if I didn't lose my hair (fat chance).   marcy4--The AC went OK for me.  I hope that it goes smoothly for you too. caltex_catlady--I can relate to your vein stick problem.  My veins aren't great either.  I went for 2 consults--the first group insisted on a port, while the 2nd group actually cringed when I mentioned that the first group wanted a port up front.  For other reasons, I went with the 2nd group.  At my first chemo tx, I needed 2 sticks to get a good vein (especially important with Adriamycin, which can actually cause bad burns if it escapes from the vein).  This time, I hydrated for a day prior, and with a heat pack prestick, the nurse got it on the first try.  I need another 10 sticks before the end of the initial treatment, and then about another 10 sticks for the full year of Herceptin, so I hope that my veins hold out. susiesue--Have you looked into The Wellness Community, which has several branches in NJ, for a support group?  They just merged with Gilda's Club, which has other branches in the area.  I just started the process of becoming a member of Gilda's Club, and the process is more arduous than I had expected--an orientation meeting, a one-on-one with a social worker, and a final telephone call with another social worker before the process is completed.  My husband and I had the 2nd step on Wednesday, and still haven't heard back with the final telephone call. emme--Hope your 2nd treatment, scheduled for today, was better than your last treatment.  Let me know how you're feeling.  Also, how long did it take for all your hair to fall out the last time around?  My hair has just started falling out yesterday, and I'm curious as to whether I should expect the process takes one week, two weeks, or longer. Happy weekend to all.  We'll all get through this.  2 down, 6 to go (plus another bunch of Herceptin) for me.  Hope to be done with the major treatments before the end of the summer.",
