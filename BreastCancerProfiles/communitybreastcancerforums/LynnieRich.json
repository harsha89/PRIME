It is NOT a normal thing. They were initially worried about multiple sclerosis as this sign can be from that. In my case it was not (phew!). I have a shifting C2/C3 vertebrae when I flex which causes the sensation. I've been wearing a collar to correct it. So if you find yourself having this, I recommend getting it checked out",

I did neoadjuvant chemo with 4 dose sense AC and 4 dose dense Taxol. I finished that November 9. During Taxol treatment I had pain which didn't persist and the tingling/slight numbness in my fingers and toes which didn't affect my functioning. It is still there but has been getting progressively better with time. However, the past two weeks or so I was having these shock like sensations in my legs (not painful, but weird) . I kind of just ignored it then tonight I was head banging (haha!) with my 3 year old son and noticed when I flexed my head forward it sent the \"shock\" down my back... into my feet, with strongest sensation in my feet. I can reproduce the feeling if I flex my head forward. I loooked it up and it's called LHermitte's. But it only seems to be a side effect of cisplatin, which I didn't receive or neck radiation. Has anyone else had this happen during or after chemo? I'm a little freaked out. Thanks!!

I did call my oncologist and the nurse said that it is not a symptom of chemotherapy that they ever really hear of. She is running it by the NP cause my MO is out this week. So we will see what they say. She seemed really stumped though. I gotta have the weird shit. Hah",

There is a Cancer Center near the hospital where I work and the radiologists that I work with say it is very good. It is also very close to my home and my work. But the doctors at MGH are insistent I go to a different (but much further) hospital because they know the people there and it is the best they know. I just feel like radiation is radiation... but they've made me nervous. Any thoughts on this? Is radiation form one facility to the next very different? Should I sacrifice convenience to go to the \"better hospital\"? Especially given that the doctors I work with seem to say the Cancer center near me is very good? (To add: my cancer was on the left side and so they want to make sure they do the \"breath hold\" technique. I haven't met with the rad onc at the closer hospital but plan to ask i they do that when I do- if they say they can't/don't I will go to the further hospital).
