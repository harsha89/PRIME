So, you're still in the same boat. And, if you wait to see something in your bloodstream, then cancer cells would have been floating about in your body, already spreading. You want to find it while it's still early and not reached that point where it launches out into the blood or lymphnodes. You're being pro-active by demanding a biopsy, so you're ahead of the game compared to alot of us. Best of luck, prayers for this to be one of those strange but non-cancerous events!!!!",
