The worst part is I don't have a support system to help me through this or if the results are bad. I am also afraid I waited too long to go and it has grown. I missed my last 2 mammos and procrastinated. I wish I could go back in time and have a do-over. I had no idea I would be dealing with this as I have no family history - was not on my radar. I hope I can get through tomorrow without passing out",

The left breast which I thought had a large mass and I was having discharge from the nipple has 6 cysts in it. The right breast, which I thought was my good breast, has 5 more cysts in it and 2 nodules. The doctor said it could be a fibroadenoma but would need to be biopsied. But he told me there was one nodule but my doctor read the report and it says 2 nodules. Not sure what happened why there is a discrepancy between the report and what he told me. I have to go in for a core biopsy next week on the largest nodule. My doctor does not understand why they don't want to biopsy both nodules. I do not have a copy of the report - when I do I will come back with the specifics. Since there is 2 nodules, is that more likely an adenoma. i think I read somewhere that multiples are not inclined to be BC. I do want to thank everyone who replied and helped me though this. Friends that I have talked to just don't understand and thought I was panicking unnecessarily. I am alone and this was very overwhelming for me.",

My appointment is on Thursday but I am going to call tomorrow morning and see if they have an openings/cancellations to let me know. I am single at this point in time but I have two good friends that are listening to me go through this and have been supportive, I just cant believe how quickly this lump appeared. I just thought it was a cyst as I had before and I became complacent in this assumption. I had no idea it would get worse and possibly something more. I regret not being more pro-active . I wish I had a second chance",

I am afraid of the outcome and if I am going to have a panic attack, pass out or throw up. I have no one to rely on and have been alone the whole week with no one to talk to. Can anyone give me some idea how to cope with this and if it is bad, how to handle it? I am afraid I will not even get threw the door and will run away",
