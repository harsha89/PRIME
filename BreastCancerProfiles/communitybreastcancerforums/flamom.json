      "Content": "flamom wrote: Hello all, I was diagnosed last week with a radial sclerosing lesion and a minute intraductal papilloma in my right breast. A quick background goes like this. On January 13th, I had a diagnostic mammogram. I was called back on January 15th for a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound because the radiologist had found an area of asymmetry in my right breast. Had the DM and ultrasound on January 28th. I was called back the 29th and told that there were two areas of clustered microcalcifications. The radiologist was very comfortable that the first area (at 9 o'clock) was benign but she wanted me to go in for a recheck in 6 months. The second area (at 10 o'clock) was more suspicious and they wanted a biopsy. I had my biopsy on February 2nd. While they were prepping me, I asked if we could biopsy both areas rather than wait with the uncertainty hanging over my head for six months. They agreed and so they biopsied both. I got the results back on Wednesday. The pathology report indicated no evidence of atypia or malignancy but the biopsy picked up a \"benign radial sclerosing lesion\" and \"minute intraductal papilloma,\" so they recommended I see a breast specialist. Thirty seconds of relief at no evidence of malignancy but back to stressing again very soon. The breast specialist had a cancellation so I was able to get in to see her on Friday. She tells me that both of these conditions \"hide\" malignant cells about 10-20% of the time and she recommends an outpatient procedure to remove them. I'm scheduled to go in on February 23rd. I swear I feel like I've learned a new language over the last month - breastology! I'm back to stressing at the possibility this could be cancer. Any thoughts or experiences would be greatly appreciated. Log in to post a reply",

Surgery started about 9:30 and I was released to go home about 12:30. I had very little pain even on the day of surgery - on a scale of 1 to 10, maybe a 2 or a 3.

Surgeon said I could shower the next day. I took it easy the day of the surgery and the next day. The worst part for me was I had really bad nausea from the anesthesia after the surgery. Follow up with the surgeon is on Wednesday. Got the pathology results this morning. Benign! No evidence of malignancy or atypia. Finally can exhale! Shayvoe good luck with your procedure. I'll be hoping and praying for good results for you.",

Got called back for diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound and then for a biopsy because they were concerned about some suspicious indeterminate microcalcifications. The biopsy report showed \"no evidence of malignancy or atypia\" but my gyno called and told me they were recommending a consultation with a breast specialist because I have a sclerosing lesion and a minute intraductal papilloma (among other benign stuff going on). I met with the breast specialist last week and she told me that both the sclerosing lesion and the intraductal papilloma are benign conditions but they strongly recommend having them excised because in a small number of cases (she said between 10 and 20% of the time) they \"hide\" some malignant cells. The biopsy only examined a sample of the tissue so to be 100% sure it's all benign, they need to remove it and examine the whole thing in pathology. She told me the odds were small but better to be safe. I go in on Monday to have a radioactive marker put in for the surgery and then have my excision scheduled for the following Tuesday. She said the results should be in about 5 days after that. Trying to stay calm but the waiting is hard. I've looked at some of the prior postings by ladies who had these things removed and analyzed and it does seem that most of the time the results are benign. Keeping my fingers crossed. Good luck to you both!",

The breast specialist didn't seem concerned. I think dense breasts just means it may be harder to see things with a mammogram so a lot of times women will also be told to get an ultrasound. ",

My biopsy for microcalcifications came back benign but showed a small radial scar as well. They referred me to a breast specialist who recommended an excisional biopsy. When I asked why it needed to be removed if it was benign, she said that in about 10-20% of cases, the radial scar hides malignant cells. Since the biopsy only looked at a piece of it, they needed to remove the radial scar to make sure there wasn't any malignancy. The procedure itself was minor - started at 9:45 am, took about an hour, and I was home by noon. I had very little pain before or after the procedure (felt more discomfort during and after the biopsy). The incision was maybe an inch long. Got the results back a few days later and everything was benign. I feel the same way you do about surgery, but I do feel better knowing it's been checked out. Good luck!",
