I understand all three see things that the other might miss.... but, what is the gold standard? I've had MRIs for other things in the past and there are so many false positive things that light up, that mean nothing. I'm almost reluctant to go through that again.... Why aren't mammos and ultras enough? Or are they??? Log in to post a reply",

Same thing....I have \"mildly atypical lobular and terminal duct hyperplasia\", so while my biopsy was benign, it showed changes. With the family history and my cyst history.... they screen me every 6 mos. for mammo and ultrasound. Lots of fun. I live in fear. But, I guess they can watch me closer....",

      "Content": "breastquest wrote: Not sure, I'm posting in the right area, but because I have a family member who had breast cancer (she's fine, btw), my doctor screens me every 6 mos. with mammo and ultrasounds. Now, because of a benign biopsy but with hyperplasia--he wants me to have a screening MRI next appt. But, he wants me to take 20 days of tamoxifen before, to blunt the MRI from lighting up all over the place. My question is about the 3 weeks of tamoxifen. I've read how it is a dangerous drug, and can cause stroke, joint pain, and other menopausal symptoms.... Right now, I'm in a miserable perimenopause with palpitations, dryness, headaches, hair thinning you name it, and I'm worried that the 20 days of tamoxifen will make everything worse, and the effects of the drug could linger. When my estrogen dips, it's hell on earth. I have an extreme sensitivity to the changing hormones. Let me know if you had to take this for the MRI, or took a short course of this and what happened?
