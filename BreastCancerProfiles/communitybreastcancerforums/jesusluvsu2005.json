    "Content": "jesusluvsu2005 wrote: Hi! I'm new here. My name is Amanda and I am 32. I found a lump in my left breast maybe three weeks ago. No family history of breast cancer. I do have colon cancer in my family. Had an ultrasound and mamogram yesterday. They said it has both bad and good characteristics. I know when they turned out the thing that shows color (i guess a blood flow thing, it was red and blue I think from what I could see), it did show a line of those colors. Does anyone know if that means anything in particular? I feel like this is going to be a good outcome but of course I can't help but be worried some. I know basically I won't know until the biopsy is done but I guess I am just trying to find out as much as I can. They did say possible early malignancy on the report according to the nurse. Any info would be greatly appreciated! Thanks! God bless, Amanda Log in to post a reply",
