      "Content": "Jan 25, 2012 11:42AM - edited Jan 25, 2012 11:46AM by bgirl Little Melons, I live in Ontario too. Government will pay for test for Node Negative Estrogen Poitive early stage cancer.  No proven studies for node positive early bc.  Adjuvant online - which our cancer centres all use had suggested that I had a 49% chance of recurrence based on my age at dx (46) tumour size, grade.  Tamox would take to 35%. +Chemo to 13%.  So it looked like chemo would be worth it because I was young.  My MO said would do test to be comfortable with decision and because I was eligible for OHIP to pay - had to fill out a request form ($4500 test in Canada as send tissue to California) plus authorization for test.  I think in the long run OHIP is hoping that they can weed out those that don't need to do chemo so they can save money!  Our tax dollars at work. We also spent a long time discussing data & studies this test is based on - so I was comfortable with that as well. Onco DX score came back 18 - CI of Recurrence in 10 years of 11% with 5 years of tamoxifen.  I was highly ER+ so tamox should be highly effective.  Only 2% benefit to doing chemo.  Not worth the risk of short and long term SE of chemo. So doing my rads (16+boosts instead of 25+boosts as indicated by McMaster study of same long term benefits)  same dose overall, just over a shorter time.  My RO was part of this study - must have gone to school there.  And working through my 5 years of Tamox as I must comply to get benefit of not doing chemo. From my personal experience it was worth having all the info I could to make the best decision for me. My understanding was that mets automatically make you stage IV, so no chemo not even a discussion (was checked-I was clean).  Also, as they are just doing study on validity of Onco DX results for node positive that it would not overrule adjuvant in deciding chemo. Only posting all this info so that people can see it is a very complicated process to make the right treatment decisions for you.  Keep asking until you get all the answers you need to make you comfortable.  Doctors should tell you about all tests, even if they know that they are not relavent based on you dx.  At least you will understand their decision making.",

Bonnie, While I made the decision against chemo with score 18, I did not have lymph/vascular involvement or nodes that were positive.  As study still open on that I would probably have been more tempted to go with chemo because of age.  You have got a tough decision girl - I think you just have to keep asking and researching (proper medical studies - not by genomic) until you feel okay with your decision.  Then don't look back - even if new info comes out later.  Yes the exercise helps, especially with sleep and stress.  Do 30 min on treadmill most days, not running yet as doing rads and told not to push too hard.",

There are a lot of factors, I think.  My MO said if i was 22 he would still have tried to talk me out of chemo.  At 25-26 he would have gone ahead even if cutoff 31.  Mostly because of my age  If I was in my 60s or 70s he wouldn`t.  Also the big trial on this test comes out in a couple of years, in it they used the cut off of 26 (lower threshold to make sure trial participants were not at undue risk).",

You are not naive about cancer and some times that makes it harder.  Knowledge is power, but it can be scary.  Stage is a combo of node status, size, and grade, so you won't really know all until after surgery.  There is a good explanation on this site.  Hoping meeting with surgeon goes well.  You continue to be in my thoughts.  Would like to write more, but I have an MRI in an hour ... so off we go again.",

Knew I would have a drain this time, but found my reaction to the surgery and pain meds harder this time. Maybe because I am 6 1/2 years older or the larger node dissection!?? It just shows that each surgery is very individual. Kind of like having babies each experience can be different for the same person. So, for those of you still waiting just try and let it unfold and take it one day at a time. Your recovery will be at your pace. Be kind to yourselves ... in the big picture it is just a short time. Remember that the pathology is just information .. all test results are just information ... they do not change what is .... if you can hang on to that lesson it can help with the scanxiety along the cancer journey. I already know there is lymph node involvement (found that first 2.8cm), but with the tumour small 8mm x 5mm hoping that the node involvement does not extend too far. Had testing a know that there is no evidence of METs from either time. I'm just a BC survivor with BC!!!",

I agree, it is the every day thing.  Annoying for so many reasons.  Disruption to routine, I could have spent my parking fees on something nicer like new shoes, and the daily reminder that yes I have cancer. Putting on cream couple times a day as suggested.  Not steroid or anything - just water based, lanolin free, perfume free moisturizer as suggested. (using Glaxal Base because costco had huge tub cheap)  Told easier to prevent some SEs rather than treat after they occur. Told 25% chance of local recurrence if I didn't have rads.  Only 5-8% chance with rads after lumpectomy.  At my age risk of not doing was not okay.  Want the best chance I have of collecting a pension and I don't want to do this again any time soon.",

People think since I didn't have chemo that it is not that bad and I will be better as soon as rads are done, which makes them feel better.  In reality had onco test that said I would only benefit 2% from chemo, so actually slightly higher chance of recurrence than if I had done chemo.  Not to mention MRI repeat on opposite breast in couple of months to look at something suspicious that showed up while doing pre-op MRI.  Thought of starting over makes me crazy and very annoyed at people who think the cancer will be over soon.  Once there, always there.  Like grief you figure out how to go on with your life, but you don't get over it. For now trying to concentrate on where I am an not what others think.  Off to rads and weekly apt with RO today. As for thinking symptoms are in your head - I think you feel what you feel. Other people just have to accept that. Kaara - Hating cancer and how it changes our lives isn't defined by age.  Yes some of us now have a goal of reaching your age, but if it comes back in 25 years I would still be mad too!  It is crappy all round - rant all you want.  Doing rads & hormone therapy and yes I am tired! I am in my 40's but felt 70 some days - planning on bouncing back and hope you will too.",
