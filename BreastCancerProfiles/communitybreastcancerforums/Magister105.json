I would definitely get the ones that zip or velcro in the front, a stepping into them and pulling them up can be a bit painful and awkward. Mine had the velcro around the middle and the drain pockets just attached to them. I had four drains and this worked pretty well. I was glad to get out of them at the end of the two weeks, though, and went to sports bras with lots of support that zipped in the front. These were pretty comfortable (and helpful to me -- I kept 2 of my drains for 6 weeks). I hope this helps!",

Long story short, yesterday I was diagnosed with breast cancer that had metastasized to my lungs, with two separate tumors. One is 6 centimeters; I don't remember the size of the other. The pneumonia is wrapped around one of them. I go for a PET Scan on Wednesday and a needle biopsy next Monday. I know this is not good, obviously, and I know this is Stage IV. I'm pretty scared.

I was very optimistic from what my onc had told me to expect. I was expecting my 9:15 appt to be over by 12:30 latest. It did not go well, and I have to confess my positive spirit took a nose dive. Everything went well until the Taxotere started. Within 15 minutes I was having super hot flashes, my face, neck and arms were red, and I was seriously nauseated. They stopped the Tax immediately and switched to saline, took temp, gave an anti-nausea pill, etc. This helped and I settled down just thinking I had had a mini-reaction. They re-started the Taxotere very slowly, and within 20 minutes I was sweating and my lungs felts as if they were thickening or something. I couldn't draw a full breath. My torso broke out into an itchy, red rash -- and I didn't care how it looked -- I just kept scratching!  They became very concerned and stopped the Tax again. This time they gave me another steroid IV, another benadryl, and saline. They restarted the Tax and we took it very slowly. I felt like such a wuss. We made it through the remaining Tax, but breathing was still short and I felt so sick. We didn't leave until 4:15. I don't feel great now, but not as bad as while that was being pumped into me. Is this just how it is? If it is, I can accept that and prepare myself for it. I just didn't expect it. I've gone back to work this week and am planning to move to full-time soon. Any advice would be appreciated. Also, my onc (who has been wonderful) forgot to give me a scrip for the pre-treatment steroid, so I hadn't taken anything. But they gave me an IV of that before I started. He was so apologetic.",

About 1 week before my surgery, I sent out an e-mail to all of my teachers and staff and told them how much I loved working with them, and that I would be out for a few weeks because I did have a cancer diagnosis that I was going to deal with.

You all are such fun, and give a newbie a sense that coming through this might not be so bad after all. I am a teacher and am going back to school tomorrow. I found out on Thursday that I will be starting chemo this Wednesday. I will lose my hair, and that came as a blow. I've always liked my hair as the best physical part of me! Since I'm with high school kids all day (they are the absolute BEST!), I decided I would avoid two adjustments - me with my normal hair, and me with a wig in 2-3 weeks. So I went wig shopping with my wonderful sister yesterday. I was NOT looking forward to this, and did not even know if I could do a wig. The first shop we went to was a disaster. The shop owner was not welcoming, and her wig selection was from the 50's. I left so depressed. But when we got to the second one -- OMG! The owner was wonderful. She has had breast cancer herself, and could not have been more thoughtful, considerate, and compassionate. She spent so much time with us and was honest and encouraging. My sister is shaving her head in support of me, so we got a wig for her, too! Anyway, this lovely person took a terrible thing and changed it into something that ended up being fun and not awful. I am so grateful for people like this. If anyone in the Nashville area needs a wig, PM me and I'll be glad to share her name. When I got home, my sister shaved off all of my curls. I am typing with a soft cap on my head now, no breasts, and compression gloves. For the first time, I FEEL like a cancer patient. I'm working on shaking that feeling and getting \"up\" for my kids tomorrow. Say a prayer that all goes well, if you don't mind. Thanks for listening. Sorry I went on for so long! Sara",

I would hate to lose that by restricting stage access. Your courage, even when you don't feel courageous, provides strength for all of us. If I am reading these posts correctly, people just want sensitivity and respect towards what their stage involves. For someone just diagnosed with progression to brain mets, a nipple-sparing mastectomy for someone at a lower stage might not seem as big an issue right then. It doesn't mean it's not as important; it's just not life-threatening for that person. I shouldn't even be making a comparison, but you get my drift, I think.

Six weeks is a LOOOOONNNNGGGG time to go without a shower! Neither doc will let me. I'm using bath wipes scrupulously every day. I can only shower if I wrap my chest area in \"Press 'N Seal\", and as you might imagine, that doesn't work so well. I am going to focus on how much better this will be when they are gone. Thanks again!",
