LVEF of 60% stable from pre-AC score\". What does the wall motion abnormality mean in plain words? What should be my next step? The onco indicated her believe that the report had a typo but I'm not convinced. Any ideas? Lumpectomy 8/2009. Chemo Start 9/2009. 4 DD ACB -> 4 DD Abraxane (Taxol Reaction) + Zometa Dx 7/2009, IDC, 3cm, Stage IIB, Grade 3, 1/9 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
