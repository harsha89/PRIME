I just had a lumpectomy on Dec.1st results came back and it did not spread to my nodes and Dr. said he got all the cancer out during the surgery.   Very Good news....Right? I am just confused, I guess it takes me a minute to understand. If the cancer is gone why would I have to do chemo, radiation or the Tomocin pill? Right now I am waiting on something called genology reports that I guess will tell what the likely hood of a reaccurance is....Right? Then I guess that will determine if I will have to do chemo or not but will have to do radiation regardless of the results and perhaps the tomoxin pill for 5 years. To those of you that have taken or do take this pill, what exactly is it and how does it make you feel? I am just 30 years old and not ready to go through menopause, will this effect me being so young? One more thing....During my surgery they went in through my armpit to take the nodes out so now I have a numb feeling in my pit and through my arm muscle my Dr. said this is common and could last anywheres from 8 to 12 months. But I have 2 friends that are nurses that said they have never heard of this. So has anyone else experienced this? And where you able to shave your pit?....gross right...but seriously. Thank You Merry Christmas,Hillary Log in to post a reply",
