My ankles started hurting and kept getting worse.   I started wearing my orthodics, but that didn't seem to help.  I went to a podiatrist and found out I had tendonitis in both ankles, but not the achilles. Mine is across the top of my inside ankle bones.  My physical therapist is the one who told me that chemo affects the connective tissues and can cause tendonitis.  I had steroid injections and wore an air cast for six weeks on the worst ankle. Then moved into braces on both ankles that I can wear in my shoes.  When I wear the braces, I have virtually no pain. As soon as I'm on my feet for even a couple hours without the braces my ankles hurt.  Sorry to hear that others are suffering too, but that's why I googled it, to see if anyone else had this problem.",
