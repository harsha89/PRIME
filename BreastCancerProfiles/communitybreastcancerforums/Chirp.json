You haven't said why your wife does not want a mammogram. Is she afraid of radiation or afriad it will hurt?  I would personally have the mammogram, preferably digital,  and see if the lump can be verified as a simple cyst, or if more evaluation is recommended. If more evlauation is recommended, see a breast surgeon, rather than a general surgeon. If the lump can be felt, it should be ery easy to do a needle biopsy so then you know for sure what is the issue.  If it turns out to be benign, and that is very likely the case, she will at least have a good baseline mammogram on file for future reference. ",
