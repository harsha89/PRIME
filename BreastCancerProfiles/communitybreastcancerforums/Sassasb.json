Having an mri and chest xray tomorrow as part of pre-lumpectomy testing, but other than checking the right breast, I am not sure what mri is looking for. Hopefully, nothing has spread to lymph nodes. I also need to have a hysterectomy due to huge fibroids. Maybe the two surgeries can be combined? I'm glad to have found this site because I am clueless about bc and am feeling very overwhelmed right now. ",
