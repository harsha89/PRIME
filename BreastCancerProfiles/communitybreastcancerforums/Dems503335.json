I went to my doc yesterday who said that she could feel a thickening and has referred me to a breastclinic. Here in the UK we have to wait up to two weeks to see a consultant and then wait again for an app if you need mammograms etc. Today it is hurting so much, burning and itching and I don't know what to do. Any help would've appreciated.",
