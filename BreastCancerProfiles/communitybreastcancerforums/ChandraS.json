    "Content": "ChandraS wrote: My wife had radical mastectomy in Dec 2012 with 10 lymp nodes removed.  Her chemo (4 AC and 4 T) started late January and the last one (Taxcall) is due this week.  After the surgery she did exercises till mid Jan and got full arm motion back and resumed them again in April. Since mid April she has started feeling extreme tightness in the surgical chest area and under the arm pit.  It is as though somebody has tightened her up and there is a stone tied up in that area. The feeling is constant - does not come and go.  This is also resulting in extreme discomfort and pain.  She is doing all the recommended exercises and has the range of motion for the arm. Have taken the following steps: - First the oncologist recommended a PT - went for two sessions, no improvement. - Saw the surgeon, who examined her and said there does not seem to be any surgical issue and recommended Pain Management - Saw Pain Management doctor, who said it could be the case of nerve damages and have put on her Neurontin and Desipramine.  They also did CTScan, MRI and X-Ray which has not shown anything.  They said PT may not help that much. - Percocet relieves the pain temporarily.  Tylenol is not that effective. - This has been ongoing for more than a month  - We are seeing the Pain Management folks who are focused on Nerve Issues only Questions: She is thinking this is a result of not continuing with the exercises and the chest area has jammed up.  Can this be true given that she has a full range of arm motion and tests dont show much.  The PT does say that there are many scar tissues that are tightened up  She is getting a feeling that this situation is permanent and that PT at this time may not help.  Is that true?    Can there be nerve issues as well as other issues? Any recommendations for a good PT in San Francisco / San Jose Bay area who can adminster a good program Log in to post a reply",
