Yesterday I went shopping for a couple of hours with my daughter.  Each of the times, what I did was short and I slept when I got home.  As a matter of fact, I'm been sleeping 12-15 hours (not solid, but not getting up either) every night.  From the time of my dx to surgery was almost 2 months and I didn't sleep much at all during that time, so I figure I'm catching up.  My pain hasn't been bad - more of a discomfort - with bruising and tenderness.  I am having numbness on my side and bottom of my arm.  This is more of an irritation to me than pain, as are the drains.  I have taken pain meds only when I went somewhere and at night so I could get comfortable to sleep.  Then I took 1/2 endocet.  I have a very low tolerance for the codine. My husband is retired, so he was here almost all of the time, but I think I would have been fine alone.  I might have even been better since he wouldn't have been hovering.  He's been so concerned and wonderful taking care of me.

My father is 91 years old and should definately not be driving.  My mother agrees, and says she won't ride with him if he does.  We convince him to voluntarily give it up.  Dad, I love driving you around.  You always treat me to lunch.  As soon as he says yes, mother states that it won't hurt to drive to the hardware store.  And he says he's losing it. If I may continue complaining about family for a bit more.  My sd lives in CA.  Since January, she said she was coming to visit.  After my dx, we asked that she not come when I had surgery, or for the following week.  She said ok, but if there was anything she could do, to let her know and if I needed her to come and entertain her dad (he is so protective), to let her know. We asked if she would come and go on a jeep trip we had signed up for before dx.  The weather we turning cold and I was going to start chemo the next and didn't want anything to get in the way and I was still sore from the surgery.  We would pay for ticket over.  She couldn't. She thought she was going to Catalina to visit a friend.  Understand, that she goes to Catalina at least 2-3 times a month.  But she still wanted to visit. We asked that she not come when I had a tx and for the following week, since I generally felt crappy then.  I sent her all of the dates.  She called this week and wants to come the 24-27.  My next tx is the 25th.  DH said he would tell her no.  I told him not to. She's not using me as her excuse, but they were on there own.  A friend volunteered to gowith me to chemo.  So, the princess will be her at 9:20,whoops, wait, make that 10:45 ( apparently she can't read the itinerary).  We got that information after I changed her dad's appointment with the neurologist and we won't be able to get in for another month.  By the way, she's not a child, she's 31. On the other hand, my ds dumped his slut puppy of a girlfriend.  So in any one has a dd available, he's a good catch - has a good job with a great future, definately isn't afraid of work,  owns his how house and is 26.  The sweetie even came by to today, looked at me and told me I was growing hair, it almost touched my ears, and it wasn't gray. Sorry for the complaining, but I really try not to say negative things around her about the princess.",

The Other Half - guys are always welcome, no matter what the situation. My guy has been totally supportive, although we have disagreed on some things.  My bs recommended lumpectomy, which I originally agreed with.  This came however, the day of diagnosis.  I then waited 3 weeks before my surgery, and didn't see him until Thursday afternoon before Monday surgery.  In that time, I thought, probably too much, and decided on a simple mastectomy. DH was against it because of recovery time.  I honestly believed he was concerned about my well being.  When I told my bs that I had changed my mind and wanted the mast.  he was ok with it, but said if I wanted immediate recon.  I would have to wait at least 3 weeks to get everything set up with a ps.  SO I went back to our original plan.  Fast forward to today. I had blood work after my first infusion and my count was low.  As I was waiting for my neulasta shot, he told me how much he hate the place.  When I asked for an explanation, he said he didn't like the way I had been suffering.  I thought I was doing fine.  I reminded him that this was making me better.  He knew it, but... This from a man who pulls at my hair everytime he passes because the birds need it for nests more than I do. I ordered wigs from PaulaYoung.com and am very pleased with them.  I ordered 2 for less than I could buy 1 locally.  Two different looks - one a little longer than my usual short cut, and the other almost identical.  If you don't like these, you can return them, so long as the tags are in tack.  I also purchased last summer a coolmax ball cap from llbean.  I wear ball caps all summer, since we boat and are outside most of the time.  This was the best investment I've made as far as caps are concerned.  It's very cool.  This year, I bought a neutral color to use anytime. To all who are getting ready to start treatments.  Good luck.  You will beat this demon",

The rest of the time I go without anything.  Most of my head is covered with a thin layer of hair, long enough to grab and pull.  My natural color had been gray, but about half of it is coming in black - or at least very dark.  Maybe I can save some money and not have to color.  I saw that someone else had mentioned a tattoo.  I have decided to have the dancing breast cancer lady (I\"m not sure what it is called, but it's a temp on bcmall.com) along with the words survivor done on my left wrist.  After deciding that, my dd told me that a friend of hers had the ribbon with Gram under it on her wrist in memory of her grandmother who had recently died. There are times that I still seem teary.  This weekend has been one of them.  I was checking out my dd's my space page and she had the ribbon in sparkles and the saying Someone I love is a Survivor.  Everytime I look at her page, I tear up.  She hasn't talked much about what was going on, and I had no idea how it had touched her. All of you were a great help to me when we had to put our dashound to sleep and we have had to have another done this weekend.  I guess we weren't paying close enough attention to what was going on with him.  He developed diabetes and by the time we saw a problem, his kidneys and heart and begun to fail and he had gone blind. The blindness is what lead up to know that something was up.  He had also lost 6 pounds - he only weighed 24.  I feel so guilty about not seeing what was happening and although he never gave any indication, I fear that he was suffering.  I realize that this has been about me, and I don't mean for it to be, but I needed to talk to someone about all of this, and all of you have always been here for me.  There is no way I can thank you enough.  I don't check in as often as I did before, but you are always in my thoughts and in my heart.

That however is not my gripe.  (I know I'm scattered, sorry)  I might have even said this before.  My step daughter is coming for a visit on Tuesday.  She has been saying she wants to come and visit since January.  We just asked that she not come right after surgery and the weeks I have tx - even gave her all the dates.  My last tx is Wed.  and I have dr. appointments every day next week except Fri.  I refuse to tell her no.  I won't be her excuse for not visiting her dad.  We have never gotten along the best as she feels like I took her dad away from her.  By the way, when he moved here, she was 26, married and lived 2 1/2 hours away from him.  It's not like she couldn't plan around the tx.  She is married, does not work, does not go to school, does not have children.  So, I'll put on my \"I'm so glad your here face\", but I have warned dh that it's his responsiblity to entertain and feed her, and if I'm feel crappy, keep her away from me.  Crappy = leave me alone to everyone, so don't try to pretend you came to help out.",

I'm not sure what you mean when you ask how does one what one wrote.  AFter you submit, what you just wrote will be at the bottom.  The tread that was last commented on will appear first on the page - once I submit this, starting chemo My 2008 will be first, until someone else submits.  The title of the thread is the first column, the person who started it is the second column, and the last person to respond is the last column.  The third and fourth are telling how many people have read it and how many have responded. Things will even out as you go through this.  Ask for and accept help from all who offer it.  There are going to be good days and bad days.  I'm not even trying to work through this.  I am lucky enough to  have the time to take and since I teach, don't want to deal the the germs.  Middle schoolers don't use the best hygiene sometimes.  I'm not sure about the hair with AC.  I am on Taxotere and Cytoxin, my hair didn't chair texture, but it begin falling out on day 14.

I had AND at the same time as my lumpectomy and went home that afternoon.  It was more of an annoyance than anything else.  I had the drain in for 1 week.  I didn't need any pain meds, but did use them as a precaution when I had the bone scan done 4 days later, and when I went to my mom's for her birthday the day after surgery.  As others have said, there is numbness and sometimes a prickly feeling, like your arm/back/side has been asleep and is coming out of it.  I found that if I rubbed the area gently, it went away, at least for a little bit.  I felt like my armpit was stuck together.  I used cornstarch and it felt better.  It also felt like things were swollen, but they weren't I wore a sports bra until the steristrips came off, then it rubbed the area and I bought some soft bras to use.  I was told not to raise my arm above my head for 2 days and then to use it as much as felt comfortable.  When I had the drains out 1 week that, they told me to use it as much as possible.  I found that  stretching in the shower with warm water running over my shoulder helped a lot. I started PT this past week (wish it had been sooner, but we had a trip planned), and she actually gave me the same stretching exercise and reccommended that it be done in the shower. I slept in the recliner the first night, but found I was more comfortable sleeping in my bed, using lots of pillows for support.  I still have a bit of difficulty reaching behind me - some brain put the toilet paper roll there, but other than that I've pretty much been able to move my arm anyway I chose for the past 2 weeks. Again, the only difficulty I feel is just being annoyed at the prickly feeling and numbness. I was able to put on pull over shirts after the first week, but I used my dh's and they were really big. Also, sorry for the ramble, but I know that you'll make out fine.  Let us know how things go.  Everyone is here for you.",

Sue - yesterday, all I felt like doing was crying.  never did, but then I think I'm cried out for a while.  It was day 4 for me.  I'm so sorry about the period.  I haven't had one in 9 years and it's been one of the best parts of those 9 years.  That's enough to make you feel yucky if nothing else was there.

Stopped a lot of worrying about my daughter.  Her doctor told her if she EVER felt anything to come in immediately, she didn't need to make an appointment. I did something that I've always wanted to do, but didn't know what I wanted.  I got a tattoo.  It's on my left inside wrist of a lady dancing, the pink ribbon her body and the word survivor next to it.  My dh didn't understand why I wanted to mutilate my body.  I told him cancer did that.  My mother wanted to know wouldn't that remind my what I went through - as if I could ever forget it.  I am glad that everyone seems to be doing well and I hope for all that it continues.  Lee .",

I'll let you know if the call was to Nairobi when the bill comes in.  I certainly hope not! Lauren, I'm seconding or thirding the helmit thing. Put it on (and then you won't have to worry about the wig blowing off) It's absolutely beautiful here today.  Already 80.  Put on a tank top and shorts.  I'm a bit lopsided, but anyone who has a problem with it (and I\"m sure I'll hear about it from my mom), can get over it.  This is me. Have a fantastic day, and may the sun shine on all of you.",

I haven't lost any hair at all, but the hair on my legs have stopped growing (not that I'm complaining).  Realized that I hadn't shaved in a few days and went to, but there was very little there. I hope everyone has a great night.",

Kayla -  I met with the rad onoc last week and had simulation/markings done on Monday.  Our plan is to start on July 7, providing my blood counts are up.  That will be day 13.  He said we could do it anytime between 2-3 weeks after the last  tx.  I asked to start as soon as possible since I want to start school in August without having to deal with any type of treatment.  This will have be ending  Wednesday before we start on Monday.  Since me luck for good counts!  bcs75 - If you are having massage, look for someone that is medically trained and ask specifically if they have worked with chemo patients or people with lymph nodes removed.  Many states don't require this certification/training and will license people with as little as 6 weeks of training.  These people can cause you damage and pain that you don't want.  Susan - I hope you are much better now. To everyone else I hope you no few se's if you having tx this week and that everyone else is feeling well. Lee",
