In any case, I was one of the many unlucky enough to suffer severe side effects from the shot - within 24 hours of getting the shot, it literally felt like someone had taken an aluminum bat and wacked every single bone in my body. The pain was so bad, I literally could barely stand putting clothes on or taking them off because my skin was so sensitive due to the swelling of all my large bones, and the pain would last for several days after each shot. Not at all pleasant as so many of you well know, I'm sure. My question, though, is did any of you end up with back problems after having taken Neulasta? I had zero history of back problems before chemo, but about 2 months after I finished the last cycle, I suddenly started developing herniated discs, spinal stenosis, degenerative disc disease - you name it, it seems like I have it. The back problems weren't transient, either, they got continually worse until, just a few months ago, I had to have major spinal surgery and I've been dealing with chronic pain and disability. I'm wondering if there's any correlation between the bone pain Neulasta causes in some people and sudden back problems. Like, does the Neulasta cause weakening or damage to the bones in some people and thus make them prone to developing long term spinal problems. I've tried searching online for medical studies or patient histories of similar trends but have had no luck. I'm really interested in hearing if anyone has experienced anything similar. Especially since I may be facing either mets to my ovaries or development of a new primary ca there, and if so, will probably have to go through yet more chemo. So, anyone notice or hear of anything similar happening? Thanks in advance for any replies, they'll be very much appreciated.
