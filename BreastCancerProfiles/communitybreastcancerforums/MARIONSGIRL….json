I have finished chemo and radiation and have been on Aromasin for a year and for the last few months I have had hand, wrist and knee pain. My MO at Dana Farber in Weymouth said it was okay to try it. It is given at the Cancer Center at South Shore Hospital. I have also gone to chiropractors and sometimes it works and other times it doesn't. Insurance paid for the chiropractor, not sure about acupunture.",

About a dozen recliners, no tv, no restrictions on cell phones and no privacy. The nurses sat across from patients behind glass and were available if necessary. There were snacks available and magazines. Some patients had food with them which was annoying since some of it was quite fragrant and I was nauseous a lot and didn't care for the food smells. Also no privacy when nurse was discussing things with patient. This is at Dana Farber Community Cancer Care. At their hospital location at South Shore Hospital, it is a large room but each person has a cubicle with a curtain and is assigned a specific nurse. It seems very private. Where I was any nurse could help you. At my first treatment , my oncologist took my sister and me to the Infusion Room and picked a seat and said have a seat and then he was gone. Glad chemo is over!

I was shocked that it was fast and painless. Don't need my reading glasses anymore! When I got home from the first eye, I was stunned at how dirty my bathroom looked! I couldn't see all the cobwebs etc before surgery. Good luck!",

It started to come out in large clumps about a week after my first chemo. I was taking a shower and washing my hair when it happened. I was told to expect it but thought it wasn't going to happen to me. I ended up getting it all cut off since there was hair everywhere, on the sheets and clothes. My sister got a buzz cut to support me! It was winter so I wore a lot of hats. My hair did grow back and it was not as thick and was curly. I had never had curly hair. It was still gray but didn't look healthy. I let it grow for quite a while and then got a short haircut which was more attractive. The curls went away. I have been on hormone therapy since March 2016, first Aromasin and now Tamoxifen. Tamoxifen has made my hair much thinner and not growing very fast - especially since I wish it would grow!",
