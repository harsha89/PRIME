I go back tomorrow (2 weeks post) but I don't think he will remove them because I'm still draining more than he wants. He will not pull them til I'm down to 30ml and I'm at 50-60ml a day. How long have ppl had the drains in? I also wondered about the reconstruction. I'm small, 34B before surgery, small ribcage and not a lot of body fat. I have divits in my chest, above were my breast were (just below my clavicles), he said he can fill them later, its early. Just wanted to hear from small women or any women who have had dents and wanted to know how they turned out. Log in to post a reply",

Its uncomfortable and annoying. But everything else looks ok. Looks like my nipples are hanging in there. He wants me to start wrapping myself with Ace bandages and hopefully that will help reduce the drainage. One thing I didn't count on was the emotions. I think its because of the pain, drains, unable to do much, etc. I'm becoming depressed. I try to stay up beat but its hard. At least no chemo. They also want me to have the BRCA gene test since I was first diagnosed at 45 yrs. So I go for that in a week.",

As for infection, the sites look great, I keep them clean, and I have to stay on antibiotics until they come out. I do move around a lot. I asked him about that and he didn't say that wasÂ a concern because he's seen women who did nothing all day and still drain. Unfortunately I'm doing what I have to. I wish I could lay around more and will try, but my life is not allowing it. I'm not lifting heavy items but am moving around. Though I heed the advise on here and will try to do less. Does anyone else have pain on their center breast bone (mediastinum) ? Mine is quite uncomfortable, esp if anything lays on it or touches it.",
