I work in the hospital and just wanted to know and find out more about what people are experiencing having BC. It's something common -  that ladies are having breast cancer, from statistics we all know that. Today at work i met a woman that related me her story about bc and she is considering her self a cancer survivor, even though she has one more surgery. YOU GOTTA be positive, you gotta keep ur head up and believe that everything will be ok. You said \"lets go \" then you just have to believe, and every morning when you are waking up you have to tell yourself to believe that after the worst good things are on their way. You are going through a lot, we all know that, but we are here to support you and want you to know that people are fighting it and are getting better. The biopsy usually determines whether or not a worrisome lump is cancer and, if it is cancer, what type it is. the diagnosis of a benign or harmless lump is reassuring so you have to be prepared for the worst and Don't be afraid,just be ready. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger!!!. I just wanted to point out that the majority of people that believed in surviving- survived! at this moment your life is changing, like others have big chenges in their lives- but is not ending!  Im sure there is a lot of good stuff to think about... so stay strong and let us know how are you doing... best wishes",
