I did notice a strange lump on my left breast but I never would have thought that all of my breast tissue would feel abnormal. I'm still going to be incredibly worried until I get the results of the ultrasound. She seems to be a character in general and I did not feel comfortable with her. Not to mention back in July I had a doctor examine my breasts and he said all was well. We'll see what happens. I guess it's better to brace yourself for the worst so you won't be shocked.",

She was less vague this time and told me she wasn't too worried but wanted to get images of them anyway. I definitely feel the lump on my left breast and now it's kind of painful, even though that may be because I'm constantly checking myself.",
