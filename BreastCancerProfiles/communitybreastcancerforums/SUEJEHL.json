Had an oopherectomy after diagnosis. Had an ovarian remnant left over from surgery but lupron put me into menopause.  Now on Letrozole, Zometa and Lupron. Hope you are doing well.  It is a crazy ride but there are tons of options out there combined with nutrition and exercise.  Met a women last year who was diagnosed with bone mets 30 years ago!  ",
