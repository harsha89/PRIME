    "Content": "Apr 15, 2012 03:14AM - edited Apr 15, 2012 03:15AM by LSCriscione My wife was diagnosed with stage II breast cancer on March 1st due to tumor size (4.5 cm).  On March 13th she had a double mastectomy and cancer was found in 2 of 27 lymph nodes.  She started a 16 week chemotherapy cycle on April 9th.  We were told by her oncologist that the pathology report indicated the cancer (if there is any remaining following the surgery) she has should be very responsive to chemotherapy drugs. I read the NYT article mentioned above and am thankful for the post.  No one needs to convince me that radiation lowers the likelihood of recurrence of breast cancer.  However, there needs to be a balance between fighting cancer and addressing overall long term health.  For instance, what is the increase leukemia risk due to radiation?  Is a lowering risk of fairly treatable breast cancer a proper trade for a rising risk of not-so-easily treatable leukemia?  The \"standard\" for my wife's condition is to receive radiation treatment.  Outside of the NYT article, does anyone know of a study that looks at the side-effects of radiation instead of the benefits.  Ultimately the decision is my wife's but I want to make sure that our discussion with the radiation oncologist is as productive as possible and does not merely center around \"that's what the standard says to do\".  She's only 44 which gives her plenty of time to die early from a recurrence of breast cancer (which would be minimized by receiving radiation) but also plenty of time to die early from leukemia, heart/lung burns, or other side effects (which would be increased by receiving radiation).",
