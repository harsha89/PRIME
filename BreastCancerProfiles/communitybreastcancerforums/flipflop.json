      "Content": "Feb 29, 2016 06:34PM - edited Feb 29, 2016 06:35PM by flipflop I would start with asking for an ultrasound and if possible time reserved for biopsy if they do find something (save you a trip back - not sure it's an option everywhere but mine was scheduled that way so I was able to have them done all at once) They also did a mammogram right after but only because they found something suspicious. It was kind of moot since the US showed more than the mammogram and they knew pretty much right away mine was cancer. An MRI followed the same week. But again they knew cancer. So I would definitely ask for an ultrasound first and if possible biopsy (ifsomething is found) at the same time. Good luck ",

You'll get to a point where you wipe off those tears, stand up, and say \"FU cancer. You're going down.\" And you will likely cry more. And then wipe those away, too. It gets easier but I agree with the poster who said it takes time to adjust to your new normal. That's a perfect way to say it. Because it's very true. I have two small kids so I get that too but they push me to keep fighting. I played this song when I would get down and it helped pick me back up: ",
