I really need to get my backside to see my doctor as for a long time now I have had discomfort in my right.b and there seems to be a kind of grissly area (not a lump) and a very itchy nipple all in the same breast, and to be honest I am worried sick, not too sure if its the 'C' word i'm so worried about or fear of the unknown or the fact I might waste my doctors time. Either way I'm finding it really tough to get my bum into gear and go see him. When I do, maybe tomorrow (eeek) if all is fine I know I will feel as ease but on the other i am just like you and hate to be a burden, but us lovely ladies really shouldnt beat ourselfves up. I have just joined this forum and everyone seems so supportive and up for a natter! x",
