I was diagnosed in June 2009 and had 4 months of chemotherapy followed by one month of radiation. All my hair came out after chemo and is slowing growing back although not very fast. I just need some advice on what shampoo to use as it is all new growth and are there any supplements that will speed up the growth. I try and go out now without my wig but there are days when my confidence dips so on goes the wig! Debs Log in to post a reply",
