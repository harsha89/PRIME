Hang in there ladies and thanks for all your tips.  They are helping me so much! Victoria",

When I was feeling anemic (fatigued and short of breath) my nurse suggested slow-release iron pills.  They are called Slow-Fe and I took one every day with 1 colace stool softener.  What a difference!  I felt so much better and now my blood tests determined my red blood cell count is back to pre-chemo \"normal\" levels.  Now I don't need to take them anymore.  Hope this tip helps any of you feel better. Love to all... Victoria",

Had BMX with proph. on right side on the 13th.  Woke up in lots of pain.  Just didn't have the right medicine.  Morphine didn't do anything for me but make me sick.  Sounds like percoset works well, I got sent home with RX of hydrocodone, called \"norco\".  Spent 2nd night in hospital only because morphine was making me so sick.  Took a few days for my bladder to \"wake up\".  Glad to be home and be done with catheters.  Have 4 drains and put them in fanny pack during the day.  Have had small bits of leakage from drainage sites.  Just have to be careful about pullingon them.  Saw PS today and will get drains out next week since there is barely anything coming out.  Healing well and getting better every day.  Thinking of all of you!",
