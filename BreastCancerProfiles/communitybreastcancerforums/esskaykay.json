      "Content": "esskaykay wrote: Hello everyone, I'm unmarried and will turn 35 next month. Since 2-3 weeks I have this pink, shiny, scaly rash with two small bumps under the skin on the upper side of my left breast, near the areola. I did not pay much attention to it but now the area is itchy and I have small hives all over both my breasts, underarms and even some on abdomen. I also feel some small and itchy, watery bumps on my lower scalp area. At times I get random 1-2 hives on my face and hands which later disappear. There is some breast and back pain on the left side, which comes and goes. Earlier this week, I went to my GYN who did a physical examination and gave me Telfast for a week and Hydrozole to apply on the area. I have been using it for 2 days but I don't see any major difference. I also got my ultrasound done of both breasts and the conclusion was: \"Both breasts demonstrate scattered fibrocystic change with prominent ducts in retroareolar regions. No solid mass seen. No architectural distortion. No macrocalcification visualized. Right axilla is unremarkable. Left axilla has few small normal looking lymph nodes largest is 5.8 x 3.9mm with a cortical thickness of 1.0mm.\" After the ultrasound I went directly to a breast specialist and surgeon and she has asked me to get another ultrasound and mammogram done along with some blood tests. She also did a physical examination and wants to check one particular nodule in my left breast but doesn't seem too concerned about the rash and has said it looks like a fungal infection for which she has given me Limisil for 3 weeks. Cancer is prevalent in both my maternal and paternal side (mom, aunts, uncles, cousins, cousin's children), with breast cancer being the dominant one.My mother was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010 which later metastasized to her liver and lymph nodes. She had her mastectomy in 2010 and a liver surgery in 2017, She has been on Herceptin throughout these years and currently undergoing chemo (Taxol) again. I also have dogs and cats and look after outdoor stray cats too. Around 2 months back I was also bitten by a dog tick on my foot and it took a long time for it to heal. Besides this I also have hormonal imbalances and have irregular periods and suffer from stress and anxiety as well. Reading about the IBC symptoms has got me really concerned and stressed. I have been using Telfast and Hydrozole since 2 days but I don't see any noticeable change to the rash or the hives. My family thinks I'm being paranoid and should give the medicines more time to work but I'm also concerned with how fast IBC spreads, which may be happening with the rash not going away and the new itchy hives. I will really appreciate your advise on what I should do? I'm sorry for the long post and I wish you all good luck and I hope we are able to get rid of cancer once and for all.

I'm seeing the breast doctor tomorrow for the U/S and Mammogram reports. Like previously mentioned, my left breast is denser specially in the UOQ, making it assymeritical?! Will I have to undergo any other test like a 3D Mammogram, MRI or biopsy, given the history in my family? Should I ask for one",

Both the breast show dense parenchyma with the left breast (it has the rash) with relatively increased density in the outer breast quardarent. The retro glandular areas are unremarkable. No solid and radio dense or radio lucent lesion is seen. The nipple areola complex is normal. No skin thickening or nipple retraction is seen. No axillary lymphadenopathy appreciated.  I\u2019m seeing the Dr. again on Monday. The rash, (which at times is light and at other times pink) is in the left breast which is and increased density in the outer breast quardarent. I read that this could also be a sign of IBC? Should I insist for a biopsy. Will appreciate some guidance. ",

They are also on my scalp and very itchy & meds don\u2019t seem to be working.",
