On 1/30 she isÂ having her left breast and lymp nodes removed. In November she noticed a lump and had a mammogram/ultrasound and the lump measured 2cm, then in December she got a second opinion and the lump grew to over 4 1/2 cm. I believe 1 to 2 lymph nodes tested positive for cancer. She will recieve chemo in 4wks and will have chemo treatments for 3months. I myself was diagnosed with cancer in 2007 (leiomyosarcoma) and knowing what I know about chemo treatment I am guiding her through this dark moment of her life. My question is what is the recovery time for a masectomy? What are the chances of reccurence and survival? What can she expect in the couple of days after her surgery? Is it difficult to care for the drainage tubes? Thank you soo much for your input and knowledge. Love, Maria/Indiana",
