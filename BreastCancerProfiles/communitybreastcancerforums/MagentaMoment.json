    "Content": "MagentaMoment wrote: My sister had a mammo a few weeks ago. 3 lumps found in her left breast. Biopsy results - 2 benign, 1 malignant. Lumpectomy scheduled for today to remove the 1 malignant tumor however MRI scheduled for yesterday prior to the surgery seems to reveal masses in both breast that were not there at time of mammogram??? Which seems bizarre. So now further testing needed. Surgeon indicates the masses do not have the same apperance as the malignant tumor.. offering consolation. Additonally suggestion that possibly masses are hormonal due to timing of MRI and menstrual cycle (not to mention pre-menopausal patient). This is sooo confusing.. we are concerned but remain encouraged. Anyone heard of something like this before.......?? Ugh. Log in to post a reply",
