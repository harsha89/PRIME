Brings me hope whenever I get an update on my email :-) Keep posting ladies on your stories of triumph! I am working with a Naturopathic oncologist and he has put me on low dose naltrexone. When I was doing research on it I came across this article. I found it very interesting and it also brought together the link btw cancer and stress as i was diagnosed after a long period of prolonged stress. Hopefully you can open this link. I wish we could attach pdf files to these posts. If it can't be opened then message me and we can exchange emails or something.",

Wish he would have cause it didn't do anything for my axilla cancer and the cancer spread through my lymphvascular axilla area including another tumour outside of lymphnodes. My allred score is 8/8 for both ER & PO - why he thought chemo would have been helpful is beyond me. We have no access to PET/CT scans here in British Columbia for regular diagnostic procedures like breast cancer.... This is why I love this thread so much. I need hope that women like me can live WELL and longer than a decade....",

My son left the nest a while ago. I agree too that to make peace with the decisions that were made with the info we had. I think if i were to do it again i woukd have have the surgery first then the chemo - just so that the main tumours were out and not shedding for 6 months of chemo. All the best, Roaming",

I had extensive cancer in the axilla and the cancer in my breast was also mixed type with mammillary lymph node cancer too. The was macro mets in the axilla and lymph vascular invasion as well. I was so shocked b/c no one ever told me that chemo generally doesn't work on highly positive hormone cancer (i am an 8/8 on the allred scale for ER & PR). I was pissed that i went through all that shit with chemo for what looked like a worse diagnosis! If i had to do this again (just might happen) i wouldn't do chemo. There is new research coming out that is showing that chemo can push cancers cells further into the body where it is more favorable to grow. It also creates inflammation in the immune system which again creates micro environments favorable to metastasis. I gave my MO shit! He was pretty shocked and basically through the cancer agency under the bus say \"well this is what we always do\". Every doctor keeps telling me that i have the most treatable cancer! I guess i won the \"Booby\" prize (sorry for the bad pun). I don't feel like i have the most treatable cancer. I just feel like i have a longer, excruciating death sentence.",
