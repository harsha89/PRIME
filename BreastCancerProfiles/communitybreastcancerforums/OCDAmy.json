I am 9 weeks PFC and my hair is coming back. I probably have about 2 inches on top but the back is growing much slower. I had my hair buzzed when it started shedding but I was never bald so that is why it is coming in more quickly. Like many of you, the eyebrows and lashes mostly left me after chemo was over. The eyebrows are filling back in but like my hair they are very gray. My eyelashes are also coming in but really short right now. I did what many of you did, I used EES twice per day and once chemo was over, I started using Lashboost by Rodan and Fields on myeyebrows and lashes and started taking Biotin. About a month before chemo I started using Monat hair products and have continued throughout treatment. Who knows if any of that helped but I thought I would share. I can't wait until I can stop wearing the hats and wig. I wondered how long it was before all of you colored your hair? I may try to embrace the gray but I doubt I will like it. And, I would love to know any styling tips. I have several cowlicks and my hair is just a mess right now, sticking up in weird places. I still have a receding hair line but I can see it is starting to fill in. I could probably do a Mohawk right now but at 53, I can't rock that look.",

My scalp is really itchy. Is there anything I can use on my scalp to help with this? Also should I wear something under the wig so this doesn't happen. I tried a headband thing from head covers but it just kept slipping. Thank you",

It allows people with cancer to receive higher, more effective doses of radiation while limiting damage to the healthy tissues and organs around it. This increases your chance for a cure and lessens the likelihood of side effects. IMRT allows the radiation dose to conform more precisely to the three-dimensional shape of the tumor by changing \u2014 modulating \u2014 the radiation beam into multiple smaller beams. This enables a higher dose of radiation to be delivered to the tumor while sparing healthy tissue around it. To deliver these smaller beams, the machine forms the radiation into varying shapes throughout the course of treatment. Recently, considerable efforts have been made to minimize cardiac toxicity of left-sided breast irradiation by new treatment methods such as deep-inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) and new radiation techniques, particularly intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT).",

How many appointments did you have before radiation started?",

I am a worrier so I am really looking forward to meeting with my RO to get all of my questions answered. I will likely be more in the December group as well as I don't think I will be starting until late November.",

It is interesting to read through your comments and see how treatments and recommendations are different. My nurse went over skin care today. I was given a prescription for Topicort to use at night before bed. I am to put that on followed by a thin layer of Vanicream which they gave me today. In the morning, I am to wash the creams off and then apply cornstarch to the affected areas with a powder puff. I can apply the cornstarch as much as I need it. I don't think I have seen anyone else say they are using cornstarch? I will be getting 28 treatments. They made an upper body mold today and I will use that each time. I will also be using a bolus. I got the impression that a bolus is only used for those who have had mastectomy, is that correct? They told me the bolus will not damage my skin. They also said something about the bolus helping to also protect the heart, I need to ask more about that. I was relieved that I do not need to hold my breath, they said the equipment they use compensates for breathing. I also got the tattoos, they use tattoos that are light pink and hardly visable. They find them using some sort of thing like a black light. I am glad to get moving on this third chapter of what seems like a never-ending story. I suppose I will join the December rads group if one is started since many of you will be done soon.",
