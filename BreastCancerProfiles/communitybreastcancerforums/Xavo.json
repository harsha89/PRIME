I do not have any personal experience of Ascites and indwelling drainage, but I want you to know that we hear you and think of you. I think Stephanie's post should be very helpful. Hang in there. What is your treatment right now? Stopping the cancer's activities is the key to reducing the belly fluids, while draining providing relief. Do not put more pressures on yourself, such as Christmas preparation. Do you have anyone around who could help you planning and preparing for Christmas? Or, if you are well enough, do you think you can just take your son for a fun Christmas dinner at a home or a restaurant? Children can take a Mom sick Christmas for one year. They can be resilient. In any case, you should take good care of yourself. Be restful, relaxed, and calm. Hugs.",

Is it because it occurs to 1 of 25 patients who show CA27.29 or CA 15-3 (about 30% MBC patients do not show), as ShetlandPoby's onc said? Really? ShetlandPony and Kandy, also Jenifer, so much I hope you achieve another normalization of TW at no time. This morning I found another place saying the same: \"Normalization of tumor marker values may indicate cure despite radiographic evidence of persistent disease. In this circumstance, the residual tumor is frequently nonviable.\"( http://www.aboutcancer.com/tumor_markers2.htm). This time I noticed that it is only a possibility, which is still a good news. Heidi, Lauriesh, Lynnwood, Goodie, I think you are the lucky 4%. I have had normal CA 27.29 for only 4 months after having been on Afinitor/Aromasin combo for 7 months. CT Scans showed shrinkage or disappearance of the lesions. No PET scan so far. I have my treatment at Dana Farber. The oncs there seemed do not use PET scan for us MBC patients. No way in my case to think about anything better than getting improved and being stable. I can only wish it last at this point.   ",

To further qualify, remission might be a more prudent word instead of cure in the case of MBC? I think if this point has any truth, it is not without meaning or significance in terms of treatment options. For those luckier ones who have had sustained normal tumor marker values, the continue treatment might well be very light to avoid unnecessary drug side effects. In Lynnwood's case, the 40s might well be her individual upper normal. Of course the question then is how long a sustained normal period is long enough. For instance, Kandy's normal tumor marker time was very long, 2 and a half year. Sign. However, I naturally like this insight.   ",

      "Content": "Dec 16, 2015 12:28PM - edited Dec 16, 2015 08:07PM by Xavo I had had the strongest chemo possible 13 years ago for my BC - A/C (I forgot if I also had T, I need to go back to my file 13 years ago. Dana Farber second opinion onc said I had had the best chemo. So I assume I probably did have T), dose dens, 8 round, full dose that knocked my toes numb for ever. The onc who did the chemo for me 13 years ago told me then that the best rate of successful chemo is 30%. I am not sure if there is any difference between BC patients and MBC patients in terms of the success rate in results of the chemo. In any case, obviously full dose chemo is not effective enough to qualify for being a cure. The whole practice of treating BC, let alone MBC, is still quite much of a nature of crap shoot. All the oncs can do is to enlarge the chance. So the protocol for BC treatment is surgery, full dose chemo, and full dose radiation. The current normal protocol for MBC treatments is based on years of data collection (the fact is the onc cold and still can do whatever s/he thinks to fit, there is only loose guideline from the onc association there to offer suggestions), so it is reasonable but also problematic, given the cruel fact that there is no cure yet. For us, the crucial problem is our oncs' mind is set on the statics, which could miss our chance to achieve a better results. I mean, the current protocol to treat MBC can result in no more than 5% cure or really long term survival. I am wondering sometimes if the statistics based standard MBC treatment protocols actually cost some or many MBC women better results with insufficient treatments. I mean, if each MBC patient could be really treated individually according to the specific conditions (some aggressively, some not), the chance of better results might be bigger. All we MBC patients should be aware of the less scientific nature of our current treatment protocol and be really proactive. In my own case, I am bothered by knowing too little to say anything. I am still studying. My so far bone only mets is quite extensive and partially diffuse. I am not yet knowledgeable enough to suggest any nova treatment. I am trying to understand fully my onc's decisions on my treatment which is both simple and minimal, just daily Letrozole and monthly Zometa plus blood draw and scans every 6 months (I did ask my onc if I can use radiation to kill the cancer one place after another. My onc said the amount of radiation doses I need to treat all my mets sites is more than my body can take). The results after 10 months are probably just average, stable. I of course wish it could be better. Or, I should not. I just do not know! I will have to keep studying.",

As osteoblastic lesions (bumpy bone surface caused by the bone making more of itself under the cancer attacks), in comparison with its opposite, osteolytic lesions (holes in the bones caused by the bone retreating from the cancer's attacks, osteoblastic lesions suggest slower growth of the cancer. That is, when the bones have the time to resist against the cancer's attacks, it produce more of themselves. When the cancer's attacks are more speedy, the bones will have to retreat by removing themselves from the cancer. So, in either case, screlotic lesions are more favorable. In your case, if your scan reading used the term \"screlotic changes\", it is more likely a suggestion of healing. Hope it helps.",

My own experience of having cancer returning is just a little longer than yours with mets to the bones (same areas except for the skull). Just in case, have you done a new biopsy on your mets? I think it is very important and necessary for every TN subtype case to do biopsy on mets, because the subtype of BC could change. Mine has changed from TN to ER+/PR+. HER2 remained the same negative. Hope you have very successful treatment!",
