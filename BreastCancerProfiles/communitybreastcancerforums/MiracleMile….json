NED since about September of 2008. About 18 months ago i went to every 4 weeks infusions instead of every 3 weeks. In part that was because i was getting Xgeva shots every 4 weeks and I did not like going in twice a month. My oncologist was chary about the change in light of no studies or protocols on 4 weeks versus 3 weeks. But I have remained stable so no current objection. He prescribes the same dosage as before. I sense that the herceptin remains at therapeutic levels because my herceptin drippy nose etc. continues unabated in the week before infusion. So Muggleborn, talk to your oncologist about returning to herceptin every 4 weeks or once a month at least to start. I'm with Cafelovr. Insist on sticking with what works; HERCEPTIN. I would never risk going off herceptin. I credit Herceptin with my being here at all. In my opinion too risky to stay off herceptin. Best regards.  ",

I agree with other posters about getting representation if improved medical documentation does not fix things at reconsideration.  Another problem may have been happy talk when you filled out the daily activity report.  We are so used to downplaying the way the cancer and treatment interferes with our functioning that that may have done you in. When you request the reconsideration, go to the SSA office in person and ask for a copy of the medical file.  That will include both the medical evidence the disability determination service had when it made the decision as well as internal processing and thinking of the evaluators.  Be adamant about getting a copy!  You may find that important informtion did not make it into your file - gaps that you can fix.  I also recommend that you get the telephone number of the disability determination unit making the reconsideration determination so that you can make personal contact.  On the reconsideration form where it asks about additional evidence, write this:  yes - when I and my treatment team have reviewed the file to see what is missing. Finally, in many circuits, if your treating physician says you meet the listing of impairments and documents why, then the burden shifts to SSA to show why you are not medically eligible.  Go here to get to SSA's program rules including regulations:   http://www.ssa.gov/regulations/ Then go to regulations and click on \"404.\"  The listing of ipairments including for cancer - #13 malignant neoplastic - are in the appendix following 404.1599.  You look like you meet the criteria for 13.10 but read the preface to the individual listings. Good luck.  If you get the documentation to the disability determination service - usually a unit within the state government that contracts with SSA and operates under SSA's  jurisdiction, I think you will have a good shot at turning this around at reconsideration.   About paying your premiums, ask the social workers where you get your herceptin infusions for some short-term help in defraying the cost of the premiums while you get over this hump. ",

If you are part of an IPA, it is often the medical director of the IPA making the decision, rather than someone with relevant clinical expertise. In California if you appeal the initial adverse decision, the state health plan laws require that the person making the appeal decision have clinical experience and expertise.

I was diagnosed stage IV the beginning of December 2007 and, thanks to Herceptin, have been NED now for 7 years.

Marvass, you may want to consider your wife taking what I take in the hopes of reducing my risk of brain mets: On an empty stomach, 1500 mg green tea extract with quercetin. The empty stomach and quercetin enhance absorption.

You can qualify for an extension of COBRA benefits by getting a disability determination from SSA even if you would not qualify for SSI because of income or resources or Social Security Disability Insurance Benefits because not enough of a work history.  Or if you simply elect not to apply for benefits. Federal law provides that a person who qualifies for 18 months of COBRA benefits - i.e., private health care benefits you pay for following termination of employment - may have those benefits extended an additional 11 months to 29 months total if there is a disability determination by the Social Security Administration that the person met the Social Security disability standard in the first 60 days of the initial COBRA coverage and currently meets that standard.  29 U.S.C. §§ 1161 et seq., 26 U.S.C. § 4980B.  The Social Security Administration, through its Federal Disability Determination Service, makes the COBRA-only determination of disability for adults and children who do not meet the SSI income and/or resource eligibility standards or who do not qualify for SSDI benefits on grounds other than disability such as not enough of a work history or who simply elect not to apply for benefits.   There used to be a section in the public POMS (Program Operations Manual System, SSA's internal guidelines) on the Social Security website that explained the COBRA-only disability determination process.  Unfortunately that POMS section is no longer a part of the public POMS but may be a part of the POMS available electronically to the local Social Security office.  The local office collects the medical reports and information you have and gets you to sign medical releases just as it would for any disability determination case.  In addition, the local office gets information about the deadline for getting the determination (i.e., before the 18-month regular COBRA period expires) and when the initial 60-day period starts and ends because there needs to be a determination that COBRA insured person met the Social Security disability standard within that time period in addition to currently meeting the standard.  The local Social Security Office forwards the package to:           Federal Disability Determination Service                    Office of Disability, Social Security Administration                    6-G-21 Dickinson Tower                    P.O. Box 17357                    Baltimore MD 21241 I recommend that you provide the local office with a copy of this reply to explain what you are asking for.  If there is nothing in the POMS available to the field office or there is any question about the procedure to be followed including what \"special handling\" flags should be used, the local office will check with its regional office or with the federal DDS directly.  Ask for a contact name and telephone number or fax number so that you can send in additional information and reports directly to the federal DDS. If you run into any problems getting your request for a COBRA-only disability determination, contact your local congressional office.  Ask to speak with the person who handles constituent problems with Social Security.  This reply may also explain the help you need and the urgency. ",

Another reason for not stopping the herceptin is our stage IV special risk for brain mets since herceptin does not pass through the blood brain barrier.  (I'm taking a bunch of supplements I hope will protect the brain.)  I think the herceptin keeps whatever cancer cells are floating through our systems down to a minimum  thereby reducing our risk for brain mets. You are in my thoughts.",
