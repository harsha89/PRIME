I've felt fine so far and went to my cousin's for dinner. I walked there to get some exercise (also a fast walking New Yorker) and I was a little slower than usually. Kind of a bummer and knocked me out a bit. But so worth seeing my family and let them see I'm in one piece after round 1. I'm home now resting up, hoping the nuelasta pains go easy on me, going into day 4 tomorrow. Praying and taking all the preventive advice I can dig up! Fingers crossed! Latinmixy - thanks for sharing you're story. I tend to air on the side of 'wait it out and it will be fine' so I think I needed to hear this. I'm praying for you and hope all goes well on Tuesday! Aterry - I had my 1st infusion on Tuesday at MSK. I got there at 12pm and didn't get out until almost 8pm. I thought is was just typical, but you've given me hope it was due to the holiday weekend now that you have shed some light on it. Otherwise I may switch to the westchester office which is closer to me, but I love my nurse in the city. Gina - my sisters and I are a prayer triangle, we'll be praying for you often along with everyone here in the group. When I was scheduled for my first infusion my sister sent this to our giant family who are a good bunch of prayer warriors!   Nfullblume - I'm so happy to here you're getting sometime off! I miss my work so much but the past two months has been so wild I don't think I could have kept up. Let alone take on a promotion! To the rest of the gang - I hope everyone found some silver linings today! Prays for everyone!  Cheers! Eileen",

I'll keep the ibuprofen handy and stick with the Claritin. Pamela - I'm sorry to hear about your loss of taste. Hopefully it will be temporary!

You are all great and I have learned so much to prepare for chemo (AHHHH) next week from reading your posts. I'm heading supply shopping now. Looking forward to traveling this journey with all of you strong amazing November Ladies! I'm not able to work (because of the travel requirements of my job) so I'm spending a lot of time praying. I'm going to start a list of all the November Ladies and keep each of you in my prayers.  To all the gals posting pics in their fabulous wigs - You all really do look gorgeous and very natural! My 3 year old niece lives with me and to help her understand we let her pick out a wig. Let's just say she loves pink and blue. I'll post a pick when it arrives and will search some brown hair to match my God given hair in the meantime.",

I'm on day 9 after round 1 of AC and doing well. I got my time of the month yesterday along with insane lower back pain. Took some ibuprofen and faired well. Thought is was from my period, but I see Annie had the same pain on day 8. So who really knows!! Nfullblume - would you mind sharing what you are juicing. you really do look fab! I'm doing carrots, celery, beers with fresh ginger and turmeric once a day. But I feel like I should up my game? Would be curious to know what others are doing? Leslie - I'm so sorry to hear you are feeling bummed. I fell into it a couple days ago too. I was just a bit emotional and anxious. It really sucked but thank God it passed. Talking it out with my sisters really helped figure out where it was coming from. I'm scared of this whole crazy process and I miss my normal life. Now I'm coping and trying to balance treatment and my real life. I'm thinking about you and hoping it isn't temporary! BG - I'm going out wig shopping in a few. I feel so vane, but this is freaking me out too! I haven't cut yet, but my second treatment is on the 6th so I probably need to face the music on this one. üòù I just keep saying to myself \"no hair, don't care\", but I do care. I feel your pain girl! Side note - to all the gals chatting about electrolytes - My MO was concerned I'm over doing it on water and eliminating good potassium and electrolytes too. She sent me to the nutritionist who said keep up the water, and replenish your potassium and electrolytes with half a banana and nuts / nut butter once a day. Praying for all of you strong warriors! This to shall pass!",

Dinarose - I get chemo on Tuesday am 100% normal on Wednesday & Thursday. And by Friday I'm paranoid emotional basket case. A little tired but I think that is stressed induced. And then I wake up on Sunday like nothing ever happened. My poor family! Lol. I might cave and take the anti anxiety next time. Nfullblume - I haven't had any nausea. üôåüèªMy MO hits me with the following during chemo: emend, aloxi and dexamethosone. Then for the the next two mornings I have to take 3 dexamethones. And can take zofran as needed, up to 3 a day. I did take the zofran as prescribed on round 1 on day 2-4. But for round 2 I cut it back to 2 a day for days 2 & 3. I may try to lose it all together on the next go around. Although I'm a bit scared to mess with it. But I hate meds. I don't even take antibiotics in real life. BG - I'm chemo before surgery too. Although I'm praying my cancer disappears before I get there. BUT in the event my big old tumor does need to go, I'm meeting with the plastic surgeon this week for a consult and photo shoot. So weird. I really don't know what to expect and feel a little overwhelmed. I'll let you know how it goes. As for my hair, I finally braved up and had my cousin shave it off. Not nearly as traumatic as I thought it would be. I got a few looks in my wig but I just pretended I didn't notice. ",
