It's day 16 for me.  I was told by day 17 it would be gone.  Well the doc was right.  The rest is being shaved later today.  I just put a scarf on to cover it up. I don't want to scare the kids yet as I had a good cry on Dh's shoulders.  I love my man.  It just makes it more real when you lose your hair.  It's tough. But well.. I will be going out today with the scarf and put my big girl panties on and go live my life.. because I AM HERE TO LIVE IT! Cancer won't beat the shit out of me!  Anyway.. with the Neulasta shot.  Has anyone's doctor put them  on Naproxen?  I know I took that the first shot and I felt NO PAIN what so ever.  So I started to take it again this shot.  I took the shot yesterday and I have no pain yet.   Will take it the rest of the week to be sure.   This second chemo went better than the first.  Not feeling as tired, and I of course don't have the migraine that I had during the first dose which is helping me cope.   Gotta run.. I am wishing everyone a happy sunday! <3",

They are staying away from when left side where I had the nodes removed and basically channeling the excess fluid to the groin area, where I have lymph nodes that 'work'. You can google for more information, but I would start at the lymphedema society website first for more up to date information.",

I have done chemo #1.  I have a carinbride page that I update if anyone wants to follow :) www.caringbridge.org/visit/mda... you just have to sign up with an email/password so we know your valid ;)  As of now.. I'm just gonna copy and paste what I wrote: So yesterday afternoon we finish with my oncology appt around noon, and go to my friendly neighborhood Safeway as that's where I fill all my prescriptions. I walk in with about 3 pages, or what it feels like is a zillion drugs to open my own pharmacy. I ask her that I need to know what the drugs are going to cost. She looks at the sheets and starts to panic. She only has about 15 minutes to order the drugs for todays dispensing. And yes. I need them tomorrow. So off she went with her speedy fingers put to work. Yay she's Awesome. She gets the orders in and I find out that Ryan's benefits are wickedly fantastic. Let's just say I got 1175 airmiles on those alone. Hmm honey, where we going after all this is done??  Fast forward to 8 pm when picking up the arsenal of drugs. Go home, make myself a spreadsheet to tell me what time, drug and when. Fast forward to 730 this morning. We drop off Alicia at her friend Maxine, thanks guys. Then go to TBCC or Tom Baker Cancer Center. Ended up arriving half hour early. We decided that some food was in order, and with eggs Benny on the menu.. mmmm. So we checked in about 850 am. Didn't get called in until after 945. Here is where that deep down braveness had to surface, as well as my meditation skills and, of course my hubby Ryan. I think the worst was what not to expect. The chemo nurses were wonderful. They explained every step of the way. I think the worst was getting the bandages off the port, as it was still tender.  So now it's time for the \"Red Devil\" How can something that needs to have the nurse cover up, double glove up and wear glasses be good for me?? Oh wait.. it is isn't good for me.. but GREAT and kills the CANCER! So.. that went in well. No issues. Flush next, then the next part of my treatment. This one was an hour long. Good think I had some wonderful friends who were able to talk to me while I was in treatment. I was by a lovely window over looking the valley. (pictures to follow) So all went well (except for that migraine). I have wonderful friends and family taking care of me. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I did sleep most of the day and will just take it one day at a time and one foot in front of the other, to take up one morning to be FREE! I WILL BEAT CANCER!  I am sorry i am unable to respond to each of you seperately.  Just know that YOU ARE ALL in my daily thoughts and prayers!   love n light 'gnight!",

HUGE migraine hit with the upset tummy part.  Tried to ice my neck but that did no good.  So I just took 2 gravol and went to bed.  I feel not too bad today, but am tired.  I think it's getting on nap time for me.  So far so good.  Crossing fingers it says this way.   Nocompromise.. I love love love those buffs.  Have fun wearing them!! And I love the new motto to go with them!  Villia... I had severe ache from my first chemo too. I used L'Oreal Paris go360 clean Deep facial cleanser and it came with a little rubby face scrubby.  I was clear in 2 days!! I am one not to use creams on acne if possible because I am a believer that creams on our ouchies sometimes drive them deeper and tend not to heal.  Now my face is clear and looking good.  For my head I used a product from passion parties.  I LOVE it and the scent.  Its one I can handle.  Its call salt glow body scrub. I use it all over to get rid of excess dead skin and when I used it on my head it was like a head massage.  Oh it felt soo nice!!   Another one I use is from the Body shop. It's called Cranerry joy body polish, with real cranberry extract.  It's got seeds and stuff in it as a gritt, that ohhh I love the feel of it.  And again, it gets rid of dead skin too with a special scalp massage.   Hope everyone has a good weekend and SE... semi SE free weekend!

And hungry.. I'm hungry at night all the time! WOW!  I just have to get better hydrated during the day.    Good luck with everyone who's having infusions this week.   Love n Light to all.. g'night",

Did anyone else find this?? I also found that my hair/head was hurting today and yesterday too. Is more coming out? Either give me hair.. or make me a solar panel. I mean don't get me wrong.. I love dressing up in my scarfs.  It's fun and I have people complimenting me on how great I look.  I even had to go buy earings to jazz me up to make me feel better too.  I haven't worn earings since highschool, but I must admit... I look good.. hence I feel good! I should start taking more pics when I fell great!  *sigh* Doc appt tomorrow, round 3 AC Friday.. YAY over half way done the \"devil\"   hannarigs.. that's so funny about puppy.  I'm sure my one cat looked at me and ran the first time she saw me.  I had to go sooth her and assure her it was me! LOL Now she comes around all the time.   ~~healing vibes~~ to all going through their next treatment this week.  ",

LOL I cook my bacon until really crunchy.  This way all the fat is basically cooked out.  Yummmmy bacon.. heck no that won't go! LOL  neither will sasages.  I will eat what I can eat because some day's, it's all that will get into me.  As each chemo infusion passes, it just gets harder and harder.   I am still working, but I am making the decision (with the help of a wise friend) to cut my hours back to half.  It's gonna be hard, because I'm so always on the go and never sit still.  But I do need to rest.. as you all should.  Rest, rest, rest... even if its not sleep, but resting.  I have a nice new jelly top on my mattress to make it like new and I oh so love it.  It might make it easier on me ;)  LOL   As for hair.. once mine started to fall out, I only shaved it to a #3.  It's been falling out a little here and there with each session.  I am glad I didn't shave it down bald, as I have heard that you can get some ingrown hairs that way.  I have a hard enough time when I know my hair is still faling out.  But I use a body scrub on my head.  Not only does it feel nice and cleans the pores, it gives it a nice scalp massage too.   Now off to ice my MX/swelling sites.  OY I hate day's 4-6 after chemo.  And off to get some more sleep.  Keep on winning firecrackers!! As a wise friend said to me.. this is only temporary.. IF you don't slow down now.  Because if you don't slow down now.. you may never regain your strength back again.  ((hugs)) all",
