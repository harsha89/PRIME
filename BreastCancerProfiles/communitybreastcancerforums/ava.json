      "Content": "ava wrote: Hello, recently I had a needle biopsy, then a surgery biopsy. The results were good, but after a month and half I have a swollen, hard, red and hot breast. My surgeon, said first that I have fluid, and he collected sample for test, the tests said that there is no bacteria and I have no infection. Anyway, I have taken antibiotics for 20 days. In conclusion, I don't know what is the cause and the remedy of this because my surgeon said that he doesn't know the cause, but  he saw some cases similar and that after many weeks the symptoms disappeared. Does anybody know anything about it, I will appreciate any help. Log in to post a reply",
