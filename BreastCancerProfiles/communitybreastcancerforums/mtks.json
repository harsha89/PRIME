      "Content": "May 2, 2011 06:51AM - edited May 2, 2011 06:55AM by mtks Hi Erin! I don't want to scare you but everybody has their story..and reading their experiences is what educates us and we have to keep in mind that even though most of us here have bc, there are diff. cancers. I think there are 4 diff. breast cancers.? My cancer is Invasive Lobular Carcinoma. It was pain that brought me to this disease. I had fibrcystic breast so I had lumpy breast. Due to the random pain in one specific area( at 10 o'clock) I wanted to rule it out and have the small, hard pea size lump removed. The surgeon said he could aspirate the area but I knew something wasn't right- It was the tissue that came out with the benign lump that was ILC. Again, I am not trying to scare you but I also know that we are all given the gift \"our gut feeling\",intuition- for me it's the spirit within us that guides us. Use it-it's a gift! Give yourself the peace of mind. I would really like to know what the diagnosis is because I too have started with pain(feels like a bad bruise) in my arm pit,and down and a area between my breast and collar bone. My onco dr. said if a lump forms, let him know. Well, ILC was never a lump, it was dense tissue. It grows and divides differently. Needless to say I am changing Onco. dr. It is probably nothing but it does not do you any good to worry- so get it checked. My prayer are with you! Hang in there, I am sure you are fine.",

That area also has pain on it's own. I am 7 weeks out post-exchange. Maybe I am just healing? Do you mind me asking where your area that felt \"bruised\" was? My gut tells me I need an ultrasound. My onco Dr(at my 6mo. ck up) was very laxed. He said if a lump developes, call him, otherwise I'll see you in 3 mo...........My cancer was ILC. Normally not found with a lump. Just curious when reading your experience.  ",

You may want to google it and see if that is something that may or may not be for you.?
