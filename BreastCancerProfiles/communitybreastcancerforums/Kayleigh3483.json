Had unimx w/immed pedicle TRAM recon & SNB 7/09 -- two nodes removed (micromets in 1st).  Skin necrosis developed on recon about 1wk postop.  Was a long haul to heal the wound...took till Dec and the use of hyperbaric treatments, wound VAC, etc.  At one point, I think in Sept or Oct, I started to feel a little achy in my affected arm.  Immediately got great advice here (thanks esp to Binny) and saw both a LE PT and DR -- got measured, learned some exercises and was assured that chances are what I was experiencing was just muscle fatigue, no evidence of arm swelling whatsoever.  My affected breast and around the side of it was ever so slightly larger, but was reassured that this was probably still related to the wound healing.  I know for sure my breasts were very symmetrical before mx, but as to the area on the side...heck, it's possible I was always a little fatter there, I do have a slight touch of scoliosis so I'm not exactly even when it comes to posture.  Anyway, sure enough, the achiness in the arm went away in a week or so. Started chemo FINALLY in Dec, 4 rounds AC, then on to 12 weekly Taxoteres, of which I've done 7 so far.  The AC was brutal for me so I was pretty much only aware of two states of being, nauseous or not nauseous.  About 4 weeks ago with 3 Taxotere treatments under my belt, I started to have a series of sensations, including painful burning, achiness, & shooting pains, all along various places in my arm & hand -- the pains are variable, they wax & wane indeterminately.  The recon breast and around the side is still larger but not any more so, however I started to feel like there was a slight sense of fullness on the side, tho when I looked there was no physical evidence of being any more puffy than I ever was. Went immediately to the same PTs.  I had gained about 20 lbs from chemo (nice, huh?) but have lost about 5 so far -- anyway, my arms measure bigger but the affected arm isn't significantly more so than the unaffected arm and the Ldex thingy shows totally normal range.  But everyone is sort of saying now that my side and breast being swollen, along with my arm symptoms, means I have latent lymphedema.  I say sort of because it's as if no one wants to say definitively.  They keep saying stuff like, \"based on what you are telling us,\" or \"according to your symptoms\"...etc. I've had 7 PT sessions, 2x/wk for 4 weeks w/one more to go.  They did MLD, I've now started doing self-massage and some Lebed exercises at home.  I've tried a couple compression sleeves and finally was fitted for a custom one that I haven't got yet.  I've tried some camisoles and none seem to fit right.  Just went for a bra fitting and I totally HATE the Anita thing, not sure it's right either. I also have two additional probs that seem to be complicating things...a muscle in my shoulder/back on that same side, the levator muscle, is causing me a great deal of pain.  The PT's have worked on this too, but say it's not related.  Additionally I found two lumps in the recon breast, had u/s and am being told they are fluid filled cysts and they will check them again in six months.  The lumps' arrival coincided with the onset of my LE symptoms, but everyone says they are unrelated.  Yet I'm also told cysts in a recon breast is very rare. Aside from this being one long ranty complaint, my main question is:  In the case of someone who is catching this early, will MLD always work, or is this the beginning of a losing battle?  I've gotten no relief at all...my arm symptoms still plague me; my shoulder is still killing me too.  Yet tomorrow is my last session and I'm being told to try wearing the sleeve for a few weeks (once I get it), meantime keep doing the self-MLD & exercises and then contact the PT for a follow-up to see how I am then.  It's not that I think they're doing anything wrong or not trying to help me, but I am afraid of this getting worse.  I am more than afraid, I am heartbroken.  And so freakin' confused.  Does MLD always work in early stage LE???  Is it ever just hopelessly inevitable that the swelling/symptoms will get worse no matter how much someone tries to control it?

I have pulmonary nodules that need to be biopsied via guided needle.  I also have two fluid filled cysts in my ped TRAM recon breast, most likely fat necrosis, but doc wants them needle aspirated/biopsied too. Yes, that's right, two, two biopsies just a few months after chemo.  Last I came here I was still not sure if I had LE.  Had symptoms but no swelling for sure (only what was there at time of mx by breast & side, thought maybe was just asymetrical)...but now recently have noticed some slight swelling in lower arm on affected side.  Haven't seen therapist yet, but am pretty darn sure this is it -- the big LE for real.  Therapist can't see me for weeks, meantime been doing MLD 2X/day, and Lebed.  Have custom sleeve, OTC gauntlet professionally fitted from before swelling, but never got a chance to have therapist check them for fit.  Don't wear them for too long, just when doing exercise or housework.  Hate them and also don't feel 100% confident in their fit, am afraid of making things worse (or using that as an excuse?)  Tried a professionally fitted compression bra and threw it in the back of my closet -- damn thing is like a sleeveless straight-jacket! But what do I do regarding the biopsies?  Lung biopsy is on the affected side too (just my luck)...It's bad enough to have to worry about lung metastasis and/or local recurence both at the same time, but now LE too?  I know no bp, IV, etc on that side, of course, but do I wear the sleeve/gauntlet for the procedures?  The bra?  Do MLD before...after...anything else???

I do my MLD every day, sometimes twice a day, and it doesn't provide any relief or difference of any kind.  I keep reading about people feeling so much better afterwards...but even when the PT was doing it I felt no difference.  Not once. I'm getting a custom sleeve on Wednesday (finally) but since I've no real swelling in my arm, just weird feelings, I'm not even sure that's the right call.  The only swelling is the same damn swelling that's probably been there since the mx...pretty much on my side.  But it feels different.  I have a sensation there...like it feels \"poofy\", for lack of a better word.  Yet every time I look in the mirror it is exactly the same, not more swollen at all.  I am becomming obsesed with this....it feels huge so I go look and it's no different.  I do the MLD and nothing.  I am going crazy.  Someone wrote recently here that the only good thing about having LE was that they didn't have to worry about getting it anymore.  I so understood that.  Has anyone else had an experience like this?  It just seems so cut and dry for everyone else...I'm afraid not to keep treating it in case that's what this is but there's also a part of me that wants to just say forget it. I know I'm whining but this is really getting to me.  I'm mourning and grieving and fearful and confused...and I'm not even sure what for anymore.

(and there's never been any pitting) I sought help from qualified therapist at cancer ctr and saw a doc that specialized in lymphedema.No one could say for sure if that's what I had...but all suggested I act upon it as if it was (consider myself stage 0).So, went to therapy, did my mld and got a custom sleeve. After almost a year there was no change either way.The slight swelling (if that's what it was) stayed exactly the same and my occasional burning/achiness didn't worsen or lessen.Over time I stopped mld and wearing the sleeve.I stayed cautious with that arm and never do anything risky.I tell new medical people that I have mild lymphedema just to be safe. For all these years the arm has remained the same. But after cancer treatment my general health suffered...gained weight, stopped exercising, etc. Now I'm trying to regain my health. I changed my diet and found a certified personal trainer that specializes in plus size women and is very gentle/conscientious.She is insisting that I get a sleeve to work out, even tho at this point I'm not even using any weights, just going thru the motions and taking it VERY slow. I'm nervous about wearing a sleeve.A doctor I saw years ago suggested as long as my symptoms remained stable I not wear one what with my lymphedema being questionable (or at least VERY mild) -- a sleeve could do more harm than good -- like if I don't actually have lymphedema wearing a sleeve could cause trouble.Of course I should always be vigilant and careful, which I am. I was hoping to get feedback from those on this board.Way back when this first started I got a lot of good suggestions and info here. Any experiences or thoughts?

I know that my nipple/areola was clean (had nipple sparing mastectomy) and that the margins for the rest of the breast were clear as well. Clearly I have to get another appt with either him or someone else to explain this to me, but that's not going to happen for several days...can anyone here even remotely shed any light on some of this?
