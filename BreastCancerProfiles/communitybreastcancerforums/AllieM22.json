This smaller (4mm) tumor also didn't show up on any tests (yikes). The oncologist is telling me I won't need chemo due to the fact that the tumor is grade 1, and highly hormone receptor positive (70%/10-%) and Her2 negative. So I'll just do radiation and tamoxifen. I am getting the Oncotype DX test just to be sure though. Anyone have a similar situation? (IDC, 1.8mm, stage 1, grade1, ER/PR+, HER2 -)",

I did get some fatigue oddly enough a few weeks ago--it was like I was taking an antihistamine, you know where you feel sluggish and just want to go put your head down? I met with a nutritionist (separate from this issue) and she suggested that I get my folate, iron and B-12 levels tested, along with the vitamin D test she suggests for all cancer patients. So I will do that later this week. I did start taking an extra B complex vitamin along with a regular multiple. Seems to have helped a bit. She said not to take more iron or folates before the test but that a B complex was fine to add.",

If the dr didn't mention a wire locator you may not need it and if you do, it's really not a big deal. They will numb you up. As you probably know, they do the SNB while you are under so you won't know any of that is going on. The dye insert beforehand does hurt (sorry) but it's really quick.  I figured that it was worth it so they can do the SNB vs just taking out all the lymph nodes like in the 'old days'. :) It will be over before you know it! Good luck!",

My husband changed his diet when I did after reading that book and he has seen improvement in his cholesterol, weight and other blood #s already.

Am not taking off the ones on the breast yet--plus I have to go in to get clean margins next Wed so no need to take them off any sooner. The pain in my nipple is better and when I went in last week to meet with the radiologist, she felt around there and didn't feel anything so that made me feel better.

I didn't need pain meds either after surgery although it's still sore a bit walking sometimes or if the seat belt hits the area. Wish I had had something before the SNB injections (ouch!) or the wire insertion although the wire wasn't bad (had the numbing shots) but I had it sitting up while in the mammogram \"squeeze\" so made me a bit woozy although that was probably lack of food and water the night before...

My lumpectomy was actually two spots--one at 9:00 (1.5cm) and the other small one the surgeon found when he was in there and removed. That one is at like 8:00 I think and closer to the skin. The first week out of surgery it really didn't hurt that much at all but this last week (2 weeks out of surgery) the nipple has been off and on really sensitive and sore. My scar is horizontally out from the nipple but up to it. I would be interested if anyone has had this experience--I hope it is healing under there. I need to go in for re-excision surgery next week to get better margins on the small 'surprise' one (4mm) so I guess they would see if anything was awry in there at that time...let me know what you hear on Fri....",

I did have general anesthesia but I don't think a heavy dose of it. Only had lidocaine for the wire locator which was ok except they had to do it with mammogram which was a little involved. I did however stay over at the hospital for one night--just to be precautious. Their suggestion so I took them up on it being really worn out I think from not eating and drinking at like 6:00 the night before. Just some slight discomfort--I didn't take any of the meds as didn't need them, although I think having someone to help is a really good idea (esp with kids) since you aren't supposed to reach with that arm too much at first and no lifting of anything. My husband stayed home from work for a few days and it was nice to have him cook and go to the store. I was just a little more tired than usual so napped and lounged around, but it probably depends on each person and what they did. They took out 2 lumps for me and did the SNB (with the nuclear injection). You should rest though and let your body recover from the surgery. I have read input from other women who went right back to work and regretted it. Good luck!",
