He was very blunt about what they do and showed me a video. I fear foreign things, especially under the chest muscle. Others have had great results. I had a unilateral mastectomy due to a spot (about 4mm) of invasive on a different quadrent than my DCIS. The  MRI showed the invasive, not the mammogram. Before my decision, I read this blog and many others daily. I went to a friends house and she showed me her recon. on both breasts and told me she would never do that again. She was in pain for months. The Mastectomy was not that painful. Honestly, the appendectomy I had weeks before was much, much worse.  Find the best BC doc you can. I also have a friend who is watching her DCIS. She sees a BC specialist and they are working together. Her DCIS is 1. The mastectomy will answer all your fears about more cancer being in there. Unfortunately, it's the only way to really know.",

I encourage you to message the scar and the entire area. Move the skin around with your hand so it does not adhere to the muscle. My physical therapist taught me this procedure and I do it everyday. Those nerve endings will be sensitive for a very long time, like a year or more. The more you message and manipulate the area, the better. Scar tissue is a huge problem and you'll sleep better and be more comfortable in your clothes and if you choose to wear a FB. Also, stretch often. You don't have to stretch for a long time, just stretch as much as you can tolerate. My surgeon had me doing stretching the day after my surgery. Frozen shoulder is no fun, although I did not get one but have heard about it.  I personally feel recon makes all this harder and I'm glad I did not get recon.

I guess the motion I was doing, like hitting a baseball over and over was not exactly good. Maybe if I build up to it I can handle it. What is weird is it does not hurt at all while doing the motion, it's always the next day...just like lifting weights. I would be in agony 1 or 2 days later, then get right back into it the next day. I had a trainer, but it's hard to get someone who understands cancer to work with you on a consistent basis. I'm going to check out LIvestrong at the Y. That sounds safe.

I am very fortunate I only had UMX and no chemo or rads. I thought it is unusual you had a positive node with DCIS. I thought DCIS was contained \"insitu\" and did not advance to the nodes. Regardless, fitness is so important and I keep wanting to do more and fall back. MT1, your way of progressing sounds good and I may follow that lead. I'm going to the cancer center today, someone mentioned there is a work out facility in the basement. I may check it out. I need a schedule to follow, that is specific, like you said MT1. ",

I mean after 4 CT scans, that's 2400 times the radiation one gets in a chest exray, I hope to never have another CT scan. I have heard way too many horror stories of radiation effects, ribs breaking later in life and they won't heal, heart and lung problems, burned skin that won't heal. It's just my opinion and the UCLA study on radiation gave me more reason to say no to radiation.",

The pain is typically along the band where the incision is and sometimes the muscle leading to my underarm. When I look at it in the mirror, I expect to see a huge bruise or something....but all looks normal. Then I stretch and message the area. I even put ice packs on it one time. Not sure if that was a good idea. Thanks for your input, the best way to learn is to share!",

I usually run and walk, alternate every 5 minutes for 80 minutes. This never causes a problem. The repetitive swing motion of the chuck it, my lab can chase for hours, feels fine during activity. It's the next day, like you said Outfield. That's why I'm afraid to go back to weight lifting. I tried sit ups, only a few, I used to do 100 bicycle or more depending on the day, laying on my back. My back and torso were in great shape. Now I'm afraid again because I\"m not sure how the muscles will react all interconnected. Is it muscle, bloodflow, tendons...what causes LE to flair? My PT showed me a diagram of the entire body and lymph nodes, they are literally everywhere. I still have not had swelling but I sure don't want to start either.",

What is missing other than fatty breast tissue? I did not take pain killers at all. The day after surgery my BS had me doing exersizes to avoid frozed shoulder.
