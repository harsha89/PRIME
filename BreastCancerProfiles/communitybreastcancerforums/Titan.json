About freaking out..I was freaking out last week but this week I'm fine...is that how it is going to be...up and down..freaking out...then not.... I found this \"bump/lump/ on my forearm..freaked out about it..showed it to a nurse..then another nurse..then the rads doctor..they all said it was probably a cyst or a big bite...a year or so ago I wouldn't have thought anything about it...now I freak..",

Eating like a freaking hog....have gained almost 15 pounds in 8 months...not sure I like it..used to enjoy being thin but maybe this is a healthy thing...my stomach has been a little queasy..NO I'M NOT PREGNANT...I think it may be all the freaking vitamins I'm taking...if it doesn't turn around soon though I will probably call the doctor about it... Shout out to everyone!  Hope you are all having fun! ",

The Olympics are just awesome...did you hear that the Russians are ticked that they only have a couple of medals?  Talk about stress....We all know here..that this is just a game..and while there are alot of things more important (us for instance)..they sure are enjoyable to watch...I have only skied a few times and it wasn't pretty...I admire all of those athletes.",

I wear glasses too so you really can't tell but it was nice to dig the old mascara out from wherever it went a couple of months ago! Lena..about downstairs...well...it does go...and it may come back...I think mine may be..a little..that is so weird..I'm really a prude and not having hair downstais just knocks me back a bit....like you said it really is no big deal because no one except the significant other may see it..but..just one more thing to deal with....I've never gone with the playboy bunny look!   But it is good to hear from you.  Hey I would really like to see a picture of your mouldie head..I'm curious what it really looks like..and I'm sure the rest of us would like to comment on it...you know we will be honest. I like being 50....I can bitch as much as I want and get away with it because I'm old!  Someone told me that I would get my AARP card today...NOT...I did get a huge b-day card from a friend with a the cartoon characters CAT/DOG in it..something about partying till the milk comes out of my nose..whatever. Have a great week everyone...still trying to figure out where the DH and I are going to go after rads...I don't want to go somplace isolated where there is just the two of us but I'm not ready for a bingo joint either..oh well..we will find something.",

All in all though everything went pretty well...if you want to see pics (they say proof on them). you can follow this link:   www.snapped4u.com/galleries     then click on Williams/Welsh wedding (there are 3 different selections..2 wedding and 1 reception)  The password is wedding... Judy..glad to hear that you are adjusting to your new home.   You are good to your friends..I'm not sure how good I would be about telling my \"story\" over and over again. Lena...I wish for you the best quality of life possible...I agree with you there...and wow..getting rid of that fluid had to make you feel tons better.... Betsy..my duck...I hate to hear of your news..I have tears in my \"freaking\" eyes (there you go)...I think that you will be fine..I just hate the thought of you having to go through this again..you have been through enough..dang it..but at least your Ducks are doing well..my Bucks seems to be sinking deeper and deeper into the pit...I feel bad for these kids.  Amy...how about that running!  I'm glad you are doing that.....I've picked up running to and just love it..I'm slow but improving my time little by little...at the last race I beat a friend of mine for the very first time....it was sweet,.... Geri...how's it going lady?  I miss our cyber martinis.

Josybee  About taxol after AC   it was just different than AC  some things were different than AC...it is still chemo after all....don't think it is going to be easy or you will set yourself up for disappointment...some things were better some things not as good.  I had the Neualsta shot 8 times and I think I had more side effects from that than anything...but maybe it was a combination of the two...either way you are half way done and that is AWESOME!  AC was fairly easy for me...Taxol was about the same...only different..really makes no sense..Taxol takes sooooo very long to adminster...but it wasn't as scary as the adrimycim \"push\".  It just this clear stuff that takes forever...They give you tons on benadryl, zantac and of  course, more steroids...they also watch you very closely for a reaction to the Taxol.  If you are going to have a reaction it usually occurs within the first 10 min.  Once you get through that the next 3 (or however many you will have). they don't keep quite the surveilance on you as the first one.  They also take your blood pressure every 15 min. the first time because taxol can cause a drop in blood pressure...again, after the the first time...they may not check you as much...as once nurse told me...\"as long as you are breathing you are ok\"...This is not to say they weren't watching...they just knew I was no longer a newbie and would be screaming my head off of something was weird! Dawn...my hair is growing some and it is coming in dark...which is good..one thing weird is that the nail on my little toe just fell off a couple of days ago.....very weird...! Lena...good to hear from you....I enjoy reading your posts....your are an awesome writer...whenever I see that you have posted I sit back in my chair and take it all in...glad you are feeling somewhat better!  It will happen soon! Betsy..glad rads are going OK for you,..I'm so anxious to get them started....just in case there are some microcalcifications in the right one too!",

And you are not freaking ugly..no matter     that you think you are!    p.s...I always hated those slobbering type kisses too! Tell me..did your mothers lick their fingers and then clean off your face?  I remember my mom did that..yuck!  My kids would never let me do that so I was \"broken\" early!",

What does everyone have going on for them this week?  This is my week \"off\"...so trying to get caught up with things before the \"last\" treatment and neulasta shot...Supposedly I am to set up an appt. with the radiologist to get the radiation started.. They said 2-3 weeks after chemo.  I would like to start earlier but I have learned that probably won't happen!  How many of you are taking radiation and when do you start and how long?  I know literally nothing about it...back in March my surgeon said that my radiation would be just in one small area..where the tumor was very close to the outside of my skin.  I like the sound of that but I'm preparing for FULL BODY radiation...because things seems to change!  (I'm just kidding about the full body...at least I hope so!).",

Thanks for your concern...I want to stop stressing out but I just can't! I was able to retrieve my report..It iwas Bi-Rad O because it was incomplete. I did see that it everything was normal..they did state that there are 4 round dense microcalcifications. They were there the year before but they can see them better now..I guess. They are gonig to do a sopt magnification on the calcifications...so that is that.....I hope I'm freaking out about nothing and can laugh at myself later this week. I had a typo also..I go Thursday morning at 9:15 am not Friday. and I did call them to ask them to call me if there are any cancellations...so every morning I put deodorant under my right arm and not the left...don't stand to the left of me! I just find it hard to believe there would be cancer there after 16 weeks of chemo...I am just now 2 weeks PFC (tomorrow).",

At Christmas time I was depressed over the fact that things were different this year..my daughter married and not home with us..my son home for 3 weeks.(but that wasn't long enough)...it was different and I have to get used to it but like you said it could be alot worse...I have to be grateful that I'm still here to be with them..  I just miss the years when they were little....the time went by too fast.   I miss my \"innocence\" that I had before breast cancer...that life was good and that this crap would never happen to me",

I rack my brain trying to think if I felt different from last August until Jan.....my periods were sporadic...I remember being tired..I lost 5 pounds even though I was eating..but I thought I was going through menopause...did anyone else have any symptoms before you found the freaking LUMP????  I compare myself physically and mentally now to that time. and I feel so much better now..physically..and mentally. I feel that now..if I do start feeling \"different\"..I'm runinng to the doctor as fast as I can... Helen..are you going to have reconstruction done?  I didn't have a mast. but I don't know if I would have recon done..I just don't like SURGERY!

Dose dense chemo 4 x ac, 4 x taxol..I'm tn...so they hit me with the elephant...had my heart checked out b-4 chemo...I was basically healthy besides the cancer. I worked throughout my chemo..went to work before..went back to work after the chemo...The AC wasn't that bad...food tasted funny...the nuelasta shot..I did hate that..I have to be honest..I felt like I had the flu for 24 hours...but it did go away...basically..I lived my life as normal... He*LL no it wasn't easy...chemo drugs are POWERFUL......having these drugs injected into your veins...you can't expect to feel normal..these drugs are killing the cancer! Never ever felt nausous.....took the Emend as I was told... two and 1/2 years out from chemo...I feel totally like I felt before... The meds today are so much different today than many years ago...My onc was totally concerned that I would breeze through this..and basically I did. It just ticks me off that people are so freaked out about having chemo that they won't even try it. Yes..we have a choice..we can quit it if we want too.... I just disagree with women trying to persuade other women to go natural or to have chemo.....we have to make our own decisions..we have to listen to our doctors...if you have an onc that won't listen to your concerns..go to someone else... Ok..maybe years down the road I may end up with a cancer that resulted from chemo..but you know what..I honestly feel that if I didn't have chemo at diagnosis...I would be dead by now...",
