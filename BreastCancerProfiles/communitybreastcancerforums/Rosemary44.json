You need to ask about mammosite radiation.  The surgeon does the implant for that if you want it instead of normal radiation.   Of course we're getting ahead of ourselves here, but it's best to ask any questions you can think of, and do take notes.  My surgeon taped my entire interview with him which was good to go back and listen to.  He even gave me his home number if I couldn't reach him at the office.  Nice guy.",
