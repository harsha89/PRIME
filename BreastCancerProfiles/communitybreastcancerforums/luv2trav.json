Went to gyn on 1/6 and sent for a dx mammo and sonno.  Radiologist told me it was highly suspect (BIRADS 4) and wanted me to see a BS as soon as possible.  I went to the doc yesterday and he feels that it is most likely a malignancy. Due to the weather I have to wait to tomorrow to get the biopsy done, he also said I would have to do a MRI. I am trying to find out information on stuff related to work-like whether or not I will be able to work during all this, FMLA and such.  Appreciate any help any one can give me Today is a gift...thats why they call it the present Dx 1/2011, IDC, 4cm, Stage IIA, Grade 3, 0/10 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

Plus it is good to keep busy. Hugs",
