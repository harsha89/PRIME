I've noticed for several months my left breast appeared larger than the right and had more pronounced stretch marks but I thought it could be related to my HRT (had full hysterectomy two years ago). In the past couple of weeks though, I've had a burning sensation in that side that comes and goes and some unexplained bruising. I did go to the dr. about the bruising and she said to follow up with my mammogram which did come back fine as well as the bloodwork she ran. The bruises cleared up but now I have a small pink rash with little bumps on the side of the breast and now another bruise in the same spot but on the rightbreast. I am going to a breast surgeon Monday. I feel like I'm going to go crazy checking myself all the time for any new or changing symptoms. Thinking of everyone going through this!
