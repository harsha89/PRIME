Although most research concludes that fertility drugs do not increase one's chances of getting BC, I think the verdict is still out on this. I remember reading something somewhere that said there needs to be more studies done that follow women who have had IVF treatments for a longer period of time. My hubby and I are trying to get pregnant and if we can't conceive naturally, we will definitely do fertility treatments. This is a topic of interest to me and I'll be curious to see what others have to say. Good luck to you w/ the diagnostic mammogram. It's always so scary when you have to go back for a 2nd or 3rd look, but atleast they're on top of it! Blessings :)",
