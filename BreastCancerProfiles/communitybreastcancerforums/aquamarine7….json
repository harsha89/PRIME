I didn't get any insurance statements until just after my 4th & final Neulasta shot, only to find out my share was $1300+ a pop. And, then, on my next visit they called me into the business office to inform me that a grant could have paid for it, but that it was NOT RETROACTIVE. The grant was not tied to income and would have paid over $5000. I had no way to know that I should ask.",
