But, my previous MO said only bone scans if something shows up in the blood work and/or I am having pain.... And, he said routine scans can increase the risk of leukemia. Yikes! So....I don't know if I want to have a bone scan or not (when the time comes - which won't be until July of next year) It's a long way off but I am already obsessing about it because my dx was so horrible....and sometimes I feel like I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop...
