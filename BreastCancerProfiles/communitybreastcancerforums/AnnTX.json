      "Content": "AnnTX wrote: I just finished week 4 of Taxol and my most alarming side effect is how quickly I get mentally overwhelmed. For example, if I'm engaged in one task and someone starts talking to me, I feel mentally overwhelmed and stressed. I can't handle a task and conversation at the same time. It's much much harder to multi-task. I have tried to work a few hours a few days a week and find that within a few hours, work activities that would have been minimal before chemo exhaust me in 3 hours. Did anyone else feel like this? If you did, how do you handle the people around you? It's very hard to make others not going through this understand how something that you know should be easy and quick to do is suddenly very hard. At this point, I just don't want to feel alone in this. Thanks, everyone. Log in to post a reply",
