I have one.  It is acceptable for ALL types of scans...PETs/CTs/MRIs, etc.  I have the BARD.  I'm a pharmacist within a major hospital chain, and the excuses/explanations, etc I get from different techs/RNs/LPNs are amazing. Policy dictates what they will or will not inject, but the port can and does accept ALL types of dye/scans/anesthesia, etc.  There should NEVER be a reason not to use that port.  I have stopped everything in an MRI for them to find someone to access it.  Generally, they don't have an RN around to access it, so I'm told the dye can't go in, we have to stick you, infection risk, etc.  Truth is, the port was made especially for chemo, dye, radioactive materials, etc.   The PET scan tech told me the same thing \"it goes in too fast\".  I told her that she is not sticking me, so find someone to access the PORT with the radioactive glucose.  They called an RN from the outpatient infusion center, who came over, accessed the PORT, and then did an impromptu inservice to 5 techs on how to access.  Guess what.  Once it was accessed, the tech used it for the PET, and things were fine.  It isn't that the glucose goes \"in too fast\"....if that were the case, why do we wait an hour after they inject for the glucose to be taken up into the cells??  No, the truth is, there are very few RNs who are actually trained to access a PORT, and hospitals will use every excuse they can to stick you if they don't have someone there.  Our outpatient lab actually only has an LPN.  So....NO ONE with a PORT gets accessed for blood draws.  Does that make sense??  So, when I go, and she says she has to stick me.  I tell her she has to find someone to access my port.  I sit a bit, and invariably, an RN from interventional radiology or the infusion center comes down to access it, I have my blood drawn, and I'm deaccessed.   I have horrible veins, scleroderma as well..which makes my skin hard.  If they even try to stick me, it takes at least 8 attempts, 4 different techs/LPNs, and at least an hour.  Much easier to stand my ground and make them access it.  I just hate the fact that I know to stand my ground, I work there, it will get accessed for any and all test/blood draws....but that there are so many older folks with ports that allow themselves to still be stuck.  It's why we have the port. I'm making it my cause at my hospital to really get things changed with this.  It isn't the port.  It's that there are not enough resources to access it.   oh well, my 2 cents, and my soapbox at the moment.  :) Amy ",

Difference for me is, I'm a pharmacist specializing in pediatric and adult oncology. I do this for a living, and I'm still where I don't want to be. I know the research. My name is in research protocols. I scoffed at one point at parents who would withdraw their child from a 95% curative treatment plan for leukemia to go \"natural\". I cried at every death I read in the obituary. I got mad as hell at the lawsuits filed by our hospital to force treatment, or to seek to remove a child from custody of loving, scared parents. And now I find myself at that point. Metastatic cancer that showed up after I was \"cured\" and all would be fine. Just a walk in the park. 46. Single mom of three fantastic kids that have no idea how to deal with this right now either. Time. What I would do to buy time. And maybe I have time. Maybe I don't. Right now it is new. Raw. \"not the news we were expecting\" I am trying to be graceful, appreciative of the good days, strong, hopeful, optimistic, kind, brave, and as normal as I can be. I am trying to stay me. Do I believe in my chemotherapy? Well, TAC didn't touch the original tumor. Tamoxifen worked for a year, til recurrence found at reconstruction flipped from ER+ to TNBC. I'm 0-2. Now doing xeloda and ixabepilone for lung mets, and we'll rescan after Friday to see where I am. We've had to stop xeloda the last two cycles due to stage 4 hand-foot syndrome. Reduced the ixabepilone as well due to the bone/muscle pain. I have scleroderma, and it seems I don't have the normal side effect profile as most either. I am looking at phase 1-2 trials, and will bring it up next week if my disease is not stable. I am bringing this all up to tell you I'm firmly ensconced in traditional methods. But, if and when that truly fails me....I honestly don't know how I would respond. I think it would depend on when that actually happens. Though my thoughts right now are centered around making sure my kids will be taken care of when I'm gone, I'm pretty sure I'm going to fight like hell so that will not be needed for awhile. Alternative therapies are being researched. Music therapy, acupuncture, diet, supplements, herbs. Granted, those are not too far off the beaten path, but there is a role for complementary alternative therapies [CAM], and research is starting to bear those out. And maybe most of those therapies are being researched to help us corral our fear. Give us a sense of more control. Give us peace. Peace for our decisions, so that we may live our lives with grace. Amy (not sure how to put all that stuff in my footer yet)",
