      "Content": "Feb 3, 2018 01:41PM - edited Feb 3, 2018 01:42PM by Lunaru Hi Erica, I have visited your website before and it is also a wonderful site! Very inspiring stories\u2014thank you for providing such a great resource! Your query as to the weight of the Tatastogo prompted me to do a comparison. Yes, they are heavier than the silicone forms, but because they breathe (even with the nylon outer pouch) I guess they feel lighter in that way. Also wearing a normal bra felt better for once! While it was a supporting bra, it did not have underwires (which I never wore much even before BC-wires were uncomfortable). I purchased a large Tata and I think it too big. Because I have so much extra beads, I might order just a medium empty pouch to try. My large pouch has more capacity than i use. Re: comparison: I took pictures which I couldn't load \u2014sorry! (Photo of Still You, foam/silicone weight, size D, 8oz. & Activeflow, beads, size 8, 7.5 oz. & Tata, Large, beads, size C-D, 10.5 oz.) (Photo of Tata measurement, approximately 6 inches around) (Photo of Tata with velcro opening, some beads in a baggie and some individual beads scattered) I used a kitchen scale to weigh these. The sandwich bag of beads weighs about 7 oz., so 3-4 oz. less than Tata. I included a view of the opening so you can add with a funnel or pour out/remove beads as needed. Over past few years, my remaining breast is a bit smaller (and saggier) so I removed some beads. If pouch were more compact, maybe one could use fewer beads. Still very comfortable to wear. I use the Activewear/activeFlo for swimming and exercise; in sports bra it fills the space, breathes a little, but will travel if not restrained. Forget doing downward dog in regular sports bra. I'm sure any breast form will travel without mastectomy sports bra. BTW, I have never tried adhesive forms, but my skin is so sensitive to adhesive tapes, I think I would have allergic reaction. If you know of a good mastectomy sports bra, I would love to know! Hope you find this helpful :) Thank you!",

I\u2019m sorry you are experiencing so many difficulties. I wish there were more asymmetrical dress options! Like a blouse that has a ruffle down the flat side, or something. I\u2019ve thought about wearing decorative scarf wrapped around, draped over flat side to mask the asymmetry. I keep searching for creative solutions as well. Interesting about your bra migrating, if I understand you right. Mine does too! It maybe travels most an inch toward the breast side, but most of the time it\u2019s not really noticeable...just if I wear a teeshirt. Actually before BC, my breasts were not exactly the same size anyway, so one side was slightly smaller. I doubt anyone noticed. Have you tried the mastectomy bras with lace across the V? They do a nice job masking the cleavage area. I fill the lacey cups with same color inserts on both sides so it looks same. My skin color and breast form color are different colors. They do migrate a little though. But they are comfortable Hope you can find some alternatives. ",

It is sheer luck that I have avoided many complications because my treatment was minimal due to early detection. My heart goes out to all who have not only had to fight this evil disease, but must endure painful consequences of treatment. Kudos and peace to them. You are in the SF Bay Area; have you ever been to The Next Step boutique? The women there are so wonderful and supportive. Marita, Tammy, and Julie are very knowledgeable and helpful. After my mastectomy, they really helped me. My surgeon recommended them. They have bras, lingerie, swimwear, plus wigs, hats for women undergoing chemo. They had several breast prostheses in silicone, foam...swim/sport types. They take most insurance too, when you get the bra prescription from your doctor. Their info: Next Step: 15400 National Ave, suite 120, Los Gatos 408-358-8433 I can wash all the foobs, by hand, and I only had one silicone one start to leak, oddly. I was in Vegas, so guess what happens in Vegas will stay in Vegas. :) I did donate a couple I no longer used...need to do that again. All have held up well. I wear most the three mentioned in last post, plus knitted knocker, depending on what I\u2019m wearing and activity I will be doing. Bras: I wear quite often because they\u2019re very comfy, but not sexy: Amoena Mona. They will wear out, stretch out, eventually. I have three, worn out four previously. Also have Amoena Isabel, that has lacey bit around the cleavage area, so I can wear lower cut blouses. Just purchased a Bali 3463/8540 non-mastectomy bra and tatas held well in that as well as Amoena Isabel. I have cute mastectomy leopard-print bra, probably Amoena...bought at Next Step. Occasionally wear a Playtex 18-hour 4608. While I don\u2019t own Coobie bra, I do have Genie bras and they do have small opening to insert a foob. Sadly some went in the dryer and shrank, thus aggravates lymphedema when bra is tight. Should donate those. Don\u2019t wear them often. The one I like the most has lacey front. Sport bras are non-mastectomy: Champion maxsupport 1602. I might attempt to sew a pocket. I tried on some tops tonight and I do have some where it\u2019s not noticeable that I\u2019m half flat, due to the pattern and loose fit. Others that are snug and the top accentuates my asymmetrical front...I think I\u2019d wear a foob with those. I experimented while wearing a genie bra. Anything with a cup would look lumpy, yes? I admire your confidence to go outside half flat! I bet if I did it more, it would get easier? However, if I lost the 20-30 pounds I need to lose, I think it would be enough to minimize difference of my half-flatness. I think there are breast reduction exercises out there-has anyone tried them? Uniboob normal...will I ever fully embrace it? Accept it, for sure. I liked my husband\u2019s observation, something like people go thru life and sometimes one needs an amputation and you just try to accept, adapt, and move on. We have a friend with amputated leg and you\u2019d never know it. He hikes and bikes and embraces life. He lost his wife to breast cancer...she was an amazing woman. :( We lost our breasts, but we can move on...I think it\u2019s difficult in such a breast-centric culture. And yet, so many women get this disease; I think the tattoos project for mastectomy patients was terrific at raising awareness and helping to empower women. Where once there was a breast, now there is art! A badge of strength! Still, I worry about tattoos and lymphedema...does it exacerbate the condition? Maybe apply temporary tattoos? I go thru periods of wanting to be symmetrical or finding better solutions with foobs, bras, etc. but then those times pass and honestly, most days I barely give it a thought. When I see my surgeon and she tells me of new recon developments, I listen but then decide that, no, I don\u2019t want more surgery. If I did opt for more surgery, I\u2019d want breast reduction on remaining breast. Yet, if I were diagnosed younger, like in my 20s, would I have considered reconstruction? Possibly. In my 40s, though, no. I really didn\u2019t see a need. I was ok with adapting to the change and, foremost, getting cancer-free. For everyone, it\u2019s truly a personal decision and a life experience that we mull over. Maybe it\u2019s really how to adapt this condition to our lives, rather than adapting our lives to this situation. Hope you find this helpful, Sara- Thank you! : ",

It\u2019s a nice way to remember inspiring words, and seems therapeutic, as it is an emotional roller-coaster when you have cancer. By the way, have you ever heard of Matuschka? She was a model who had a mastectomy and became an artist/activist. Just looked her up (yay google and Wikipedia) and 22 years after her mastectomy I just learnedshe tried a controversial reconstruction, which had 6 surgeries! It\u2019s odd she did this, as she used to be so open about it all. I am sorry you lost a friend to pancreatic cancer...that one is especially bad, since survivor rates are so minimal. Sadly, I have lost more than one friend to breast cancer. At least, I believe breast cancer treatments are better now than 10 or 20 or even 50 years ago, so hopefully more women and men can survive. Thank you again for your kind words. I hope you find the Next Step helpful. I still wish I could go out half flat more. On weekends I have tried it a little, but at my job, not so sure. Of course, why should I worry? I am in my cube all day! Seriously, I still wish there were some clothes that were strategically designed to obscure our half flatness. I have come across some online, but they are either expensive or out of business. I think there is a local community college with a fashion design class. They sometimes have open house. I should share my woes next time! You are right about every day we wake up, we should be thankful we are still here. Cheers to that! :)",

Yet, probably the issues I grapple with most are those related to clothing and support-wear. Sharing emotions: after surgery I had to get used to the modified me (I refused recon because it seemed so invasive and I really didn't want extensive surgery etc. Besides, what if I got cancer in the other breast? I'd do recon again?! No thank you!) My husband supported my decision and he's remained very devoted. Today, I wear a foob, but I'm thinking about going half flat full-time. Physically, scar tissue healed well but I have had some mild lymphedema in armpit area. A physical therapist showed me how massage helps and it has. Swelling is not often, so hopefully it will remain that way. Ok, biggest frustration has been with prosthetics and bras, not to mention swimwear. I have experimented with many great ideas (must check out Coobie!) thanks to valuable advice on this forum. I started with the silicone prosthesis and they were too heavy and hot. Over time they stretched out the mastectomy bras too. I transitioned to lighter weighted foam breast forms and they're okay but in hot weather still too warm. Knitted knockers are super comfy and cleverly designed but can be warm in summertime. I tried crocheting one but stitches were too lumpy :) For daily wear, really been liking my Tatastogo -a nylon bag filled with lightweight beads which you can adjust size as needed. It breathes in warm weather yet isn't too heavy. And supposedly you can wear in regular bra without it traveling. This week I experimented and it seemed to stay put. Let's talk swim forms. My first was silicone with convex shape. Big mistake. Exiting the pool, the weight of it paired with wet suit resulted in one \u201cbreast\" sagging down near my bellybutton. Tried small weighted foam form, yet too small; bead-filled triangular exercise form, which isn't bad, and the modified bathing scrunchy, which works well, but could use maybe a small weight. Still, every dressing situation requires a decision on best foob to use. My left breast isn't as large as it used to be (if only it could be smaller still!) and I think with a good sports bra I could just go out uni-boob style, to exercise or just do daily activities. Still I try to wrap my mind around why I feel uncomfortable going outside or to my job half flat? Afraid someone will ask me about having breast cancer? Wondering if younger kids in my extended family will ask questions...will I feel awkward? I'm fine with friends and older family members, though. Actually I did go out half flat a couple times recently, chatted with neighbors and honestly I don't think they even noticed. If I was full flat, that would be awesome but I don't want breast reduction surgery. No surgery, unless necessary. Many women have done clever things with clothes, and others do artistic tattoos which are very beautiful! I'd love a tattoo but worry about exacerbating the lymphedema. Sorry for the long post, it's a lot of history, but maybe it will answer some of your questions. I have no regrets of not doing reconstruction. For me, this was best decision. Wishing you all good health and peace in New Year",

The people I work with were pretty supportive and told me to take as much time as needed. I couldn\u2019t wait to return and it was nice because work took your mind off the cancer bit. No 4 year olds to argue with LOL! Still, now, I would rather be retired and camping : I\u2019m very happy to hear that your gene tests were negative\u2014hooray! You must\u2019ve been so relieved! I just read an article here about how I should get a DEXA bone scan every 2 years. I guess I have had bone scans, but not sure it was a DEXA? Have to check into that. It\u2019s recommended for premenopausal women who had tamoxifen-induced menopause. Diagnosed in my early 40s, jettisoned into menopause; 5 years after tamoxifen completed, had like 5 minutes of premenopausal life, then fell into menopause again! For 12 years, struggled with the hot flashes...yeah, welcome to our world, eh?...but finally this year, I felt coldness once more. I can wear hats and turtleneck sweaters again! Matuschka was so inspiring...seems a shame she felt like she had to do reconstruction. She really tried to raise awareness for women struggling with the scars of breast cancer, our asymmetry...turning it around to say she\u2019s still feels beautiful in spite of all she\u2019s suffered. So, when you go half flat, what kind of support do you find most comfortable? Sports bra or camisole? I like the Tatas...they do stay put in the usual bra! Knitted knocker is very comfy! But, it will move around if not restrained in pocket bra, unless you attach it to bra cup somehow. It may rise up a little higher than other breast due to its lightness, but that doesn\u2019t bother me much...doubt anyone notices. I don\u2019t wear dresses much anymore, but like to have one or two to slip on during warm days. Of course right now I hear wind gusts and maybe hail, earlier, so wouldn\u2019t want to wear one now! Truth be told, love my jeans the best. It\u2019s nice at my job, we can wear almost whatever we wish. I worked for a corporate office one time and retail...both had strict dress codes! Actually, I wonder how an organization would treat a BC survivor with a uniboob...if they decided to go half-flat? I hope they don\u2019t give survivors a hassle! Sorry this message missed your trip to Berkeley. I do recall a fabulous vegan Ethiopian restaurant near the university...can\u2019t remember name, but food was delicious! Stay strong and enjoy life!

I know what you mean, there was a reassuring, stay on track to healing, when you see them regularly. They are your team. Still, if something comes up that you\u2019re not comfortable about with respect to your health, you can contact them and see them sooner, I believe. Good news \u2014you are recovering so well that you are liberated from the doctors office a bit! :-) You said breast cancer runs in your family. Have you had the BRCA genetic test? You may wish to do that. I would recommend it...did it even though I was only one in my family, that I know of anyway. You may recall Angelina Jolie having her double mastectomy for preventative action, similar situation. My OBGYN said that if I was positive they would not only do a mastectomy on the other side, but remove the ovaries as well because of concern of ovarian cancer. I was negative on the test. If you haven\u2019t already, you may wish to look at some posts here about BRCA gene tests and see what others have done. Maybe there are new treatments I just ordered this month a small white Tata from Tatas to Go. Its a different fabric, but still soft, sturdy and breathable mesh. I will remove some of the beads because its a little full, but easy to do. They do stay put pretty well, maybe because they flex and mold to the concave chest wall when pressed inside a bra. I got a new regular, unpocketed bra this month and gave it a whirl. The Tata stayed put so happy about that. If my other breast was smaller and didn\u2019t create quite the hump on my chest, I\u2019d feel better about going out half flat. However, wearing sports bra does help compress it a bit and I noticed that loose solid color shirts may be better at not drawing attention to it. Do you find it that way as well? That was really nice that the kids were so welcoming when you returned and didn\u2019t notice the difference! :-) I am a cataloguer in a library, so mainly just deal with people that I work directly with. Now that I think about it, I went half flat to work after my surgery a couple times and no one said a word about my asymmetrical appearance! Did your colleague make you feel uncomfortable? I hope not! I did surf some sites earlier this month and found clothing places that are unfortunately not in the states. One place that had some nice dresses was JamuAustralia dot com. Expensive but pretty! I don\u2019t wear dresses much but it would be nice to have one. :-) They have pocketed dresses so you don\u2019t need to wear a bra with the dress! We went camping last weekend and I see more of that in my future, wearing more casual clothes. I did skip wearing the prosthesis most of the trip and it was fine. No one noticed, that I could tell. Something about being in nature...so much more to appreciate with tall trees and wildlife. Good for the soul. I hope you are feeling well and strong...keep positive and thank you for sharing your experiences. It does help me to adjust my own mindset living half flat. Hugs to you, Lunaru  ",
