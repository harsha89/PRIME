I was on a trial so had 8 cycles every 2 weeks instead of 3, which meant that I really didn't have a good week.  The best advice I can give you is to listen to your body. Have something to look forward to. When you're tired....rest etc. As for the loss of taste, I found tomato based food tasted best, but you could be different. I had the Neulasta shots too, but the Cancer hospital where I was treated recommended Manuka honey. A spoonful a day, and I absolutely swear by that. I still take it now.

Two cyber friends and one real friend refused chemo and they are all gone now. The real friend was simply too scared and expected to have a few years left, but she was gone in 18 months.

One thing I was told was that grade 3 cancers (faster growing) respond to chemo better as the cells are dividing more rapidly. It maybe that you won't need chemo, just hormone treatment (I've been on femara for 3 years without any problems). It's early days for you yet (a scary place) and you will feel much better and more positive once you have a treatment plan in place.

I was scared stiff at the prospect of chemo and remember sitting in the chair on the first morning thinking 'get me out of here!'. But the chemo was nowhere near as bad as I was expecting. It's not pleasant, and not something you would choose but if you batten down the hatches you are soon out the other side, forgetting what it was like (a bit like labour). You will feel rough sometimes, you will look in the mirror and wonder who it is staring back at you, but you will get through it. Your hair will grow back as normal (although it can take a while) and you will have a new look at life. You will make the most of everything and appreciate everything. Life will be good.

My friend was dx 4 years ago with triple negative, and although chemo had little effect on the cancer, she is fine. I had the same operation as you and it was OK (just remember to do the exercises). It's a really scary time for you right now but we have the best cancer centre in the country locally, and once you have all the facts & your treatment plan, you'll feel as though you're 'fighting back'.

He said 'lumpectomy' 'cos if it came back it would (likely) do so in the same breast, which is a lot easier to treat after a lumpectomy. I had the lumpectomy. The lump was a lot bigger than they they had estimated and my breast is 'mangled' but I'm still glad that I went for that option. Once dressed no-one could tell. It was a good choice.

I could have felt differently if I'd been younger, more self conscious in low cut dresses etc. but at my age (56 at dx) they like it or lump it! So yes, it can change. I know the majority are pleased with a WLE and can see very little change.  I have to say that, I'm still so pleased that I didn't have a mastectomy.",

I'm in the UK so it maybe slightly different but I am being treated by one of the two major cancer centres in the UK. I should add that I have absolute faith in both my BS and Onc who are wonderful. I had level i and ii clearance as they felt it important to 'get all the cancer' out. 24 nodes were removed and 3 were affected. My Bs told me the same as Beeb75 has said, that it is the ratio that is important. 3 out of 24 giving a better prognosis than 3 out of 10. Full movement was regained very quickly although the area was numb for over a year. I have no problems whatsoever now. Many of my friends and colleagues had full clearance (some many years ago) and I don't know of anyone with any problems. These matters should be discussed fully with your doctors. Whilst lymphedema is a risk to all us all I don't think that scaremongering is good for anyone, especially those seeking  some re-assurance. Mal",

Likewise, it doesn't make any difference putting off the surgery to 'think about it'. When I was first dx my instinct was to have a mastectomy, but when I asked my surgeon what he would do if it was his wife, he said 'a wle and then if (and that's a big if) it comes back, it will come back as another lump, instead of the chest wall'.

So I had a few days off after each chemo session, and as time went on and I felt the fatigue more I went home at lunchtime every day. I found that I was fine in the morning but by lunchtime...... I hit a brickwall and simply had to go home. I needed the workplace as a place to seem normal & didn't want to stay at home feeling sorry for myself. It was good for me.
