They aspirate (pull out the fluid) and look at it to see if it contains any abnormal cells. All of my cysts were fine, but I did have various types of abnormal cells in the tissue surrounding the cyst which was surgically removed. (It was a large, recurring cyst, which explains the surgery). I've been told that as many as 80% of these cysts are benign, so let's hope that will be the case for your wife! Mine were benign @ the time, but I've developed BC since, and I do suspect that the cysts were caused by clusters of abnormal cells blocking my ducts.   But, quit with the worrying already- it will make you crazy-don't worry until there's something definite to worry about!  My doc said the cysts are NOT indicative of cancer, and are NOT the same as tumors. So, relax, get your Christmas shopping finished, and wait for the good news! ",
