On where you're located, the sort of insurance you have, and your preferences.  I would ask my BS for recommendations - it can be helpful if they coordinate your care, but what's most important is that you have confidence in the MO and can establish a good rapport with him/her, and that the administrative/nursing staff are both competent and considerate.  Mine referred me to an oncologist, and I met with him 2 weeks after my surgery (but I had a lumpectomy), started chemo about two weeks after that.   Some things to consider - Does your insurance restrict your choice in any way - do you have to find an \"in network MO\" How far will you travel - are there MO practices close by? Do you want to go to a large system, like an academic medical center, or large hospital, or see someone in an office. The advantage of a large system is that you're likely to get the most recent, up todate care, but it can feel impersonal. Not always though. Sometimes office practices are better for the individual.  Word of mouth is good, too - ask your BS, maybe your gyn, primary care doc for suggestions.  All the best.",

And so what I'm thinking about is if I have PTEN, how to balance risk of another breast cancer versus mets, and since I see my oncologist, and gyn -surgeon every 3 months, is surveillance or bmx the wiser course. It is an intensely personal decision. For me, i worry more about mets, even with PTEN. So I'm thinking and listening. Since PTEN carries an increased risk of thyroid and uterine cancers too, i would have increased surveillance of the thyroid and probably have my uterus removed. Thinking a lot......",

More than 6 months and you're probably better with a port.  THe PICC is in my upper arm, it's attached with a butterfly bandage (maybe) , and that bandage is covered with a waterproof bandage that I can change myself after a couple of showers. There there's the port part, and that's folded up and taped to the waterproof bandage. The PICC was installed in a 20 minute procedure, after the surgeon takes an initial look at your arm and figures out a couple possible spots. Mine is a couple of inches right above my elbow, and the insertion point is about the midpoint of my elbow bend (facing forward).   There are PICC sleeves that you can get for activities like swimming and so forth - i think if you google them, you can find them. It's sort of like a balloon that your stick over your arm. I find wearing an elbow length or longer sleeve works well, but if you're worried about activities, then just wrapping the whole thing with a bandage will give you enough cushion.  It's about a 20 cm catheter - diameter 1.5 mm inserted in a 4 mm diameter vein. When my chemo is done, they'll just take it out (well, I assume the surgeon will do this under some sort of limited local anesthetic). I'm in Switzerland and I go to a designated breast cancer center in Bern.  No nodes, no mets, clear margins, but 3 cm IDC tumor, grade 3 so they recommended chemo. I had 4 sessions of epirubicin and cytoxan (I think, not sure about the \"c\") 3 weeks apart and now 12 weekly taxol. I needed one shot of neulasta after the 4th  EC (and that was abotu 2 weeks after, so it was a lower dose than usual. Still it sucked. Bone pain, ugh). THe taxol is a lot easier to tolerate - i have emend prior, then navoban (another anti nausea), dexamethasone, and two antihistamines prior to the taxol. Then I taper the steriods and take emend for two days after. My head feels pretty clear and so far so good with the neuropathy.  Also, the steroid taper is a lot less. THey manage Se's really well here.  I am really happy with the PICC line though. I suppose if you do a lot of rough and tumble stuff, it could get tangled - on the other hand, if you wrap it with a good bandage, that might work just as well. ",

Then the taxol, and the nurse would always be especially near for the first 20 minutes of the infusion incase I had a reaction. Never did. I slept through my infusion, too.... antihistamines.  My doctor also prescribed prilosec (omiprazole) because it gave me awful reflux. In fact, I was on 40 mg/day the whole time I was on chemo, and it really helped. Usually didn't take it on my off chemo weeks, but I needed it almost the whole time I was on taxol. My counts never dropped, my hair started to grow back and I once had to drive the afternoon after my morning treatment. It was ok, and not far. So different from AC, where I was lost in space for 4 or 5 days.  I did have a fungal infection in my mouth twice, so make sure you have access to antifungals.  It might have been leftover from the AC, who knows?  I didn't have any problem with my nails - they actually were stronger than they'd ever been (maybe it was lack of activity).  My onc gave me vitamin B6 while I was on taxol, had very minimal neuropathy.  Of course I kept the lovely steroid bloat, and was flushed the whole time.  It can be hard on you, so if it is, don't feel bad in addition to feeling like crap. I was really nervous about it when I started because I'd heard of allergic reactions. But, they were very careful.  I hope you'll do well too. {{{{}}}}",

Blood work was normal the whole time while on taxol My hair started to grow back, but eyelashes and brows fell out. I had a very red face, red blotchy skin. Lots of reflux, especially day of and day after. I had tingling in my fingers, felt like my hands were falling asleep. Also my feet, especially left foot, in the ball of my foot. It was never awful but annoying. Driving was weird with tingly hands. Started to get better 3-4 months after treatment, and it's pretty much gone. I was tired, but way less tired and fuzzy headed than on AC. Steroids were easier to handle too, I was able to drive the day after...once I drove a few hours after (steroids made me very fuzzy- headed). I took 1200 mg vitamin b6 daily (I think) Make sure you have a good anti reflux drug - I had 40 mg prilosec daily, Zantac works for some. Get an anti nausea drug with infusion - like emend. You should also have an antihistamine with infusion. Usually they give it before the taxol, wait 20 mins or so and then the taxol. If you're anxious during treatment get something to help calm you...Ativan, Xanax. Taxol was much easier to tolerate than AC for me. Good luck! Hope it goes well.",

If your docs in MA refer you to someone, that's great. But if not...  I used to work for UNC as an administrator, but I've been gone for 4 years now. I'm not going to tell you it's better than Duke though because people receive good care in either place. Very often it's a mix of your interaction with the docs, nurses and office staff.  The cancer centers at both Duke and UNC are quite good.  UNC has just opened a new cancer hospital. Either one would be a good choice -  try to be a \"faculty practice\" patient, which means you see the same oncologist.You may be seen by residents too, and that's part of the educational process. Duke does end up in the top 10 ratings from US News. Having dealt with the mechanics of those ratings (and it's not sour grapes because UNC is lower in the rankings) there are some technical issues about how those ratings are done. If you're going to consider Duke, I'd also consider UNC.  Some people do better in an academic setting, and the truth is that academics often have the most recent, up to date equipment and care. Sometimes the hustle and bustle of academic hospitals is tiring, too many people in one space. However, there are good oncologists in the larger cities in NC - North Carolina, like many places in the US often has a deficit of specialties outside the cities. My choice in Switzerland was to go to a designated \"breast cancer center\" in a community hospital (private hospital) rather than an academic hospital. I made that choice based on the recommendation of several doctors, and it's been a good choice. Systems are a little different here, but I really like going to a private oncologist and getting my chemo in the office. I'm not sure what your treatment entails, but a 2 hour drive in good conditions is a big hassle.We made the drive from Chapel Hill to Charlotte a few times and I always found it to be a pain in the backside. Good luck with your move though. And your choices. e. ",

The tumor was in the upper outer quadrant, so it was easy to remove and still retain the shape of my breast. Because of the Tumor grade, I am receiving chemo and will get rads, of course.

I did 4 tx  3 weeks apart with epirubicin and Cytoxan (or something that started with a C), but the epirubicin is like adriamycin, so I essentially had AC. Then, at the begining of May, I did 12 weeks taxol, each week. My hair fell out about 2 weeks after the first tx, just in time for my birthday. I had it cut off very short, and the rest came out over the next week. I used packing tape to pull it out. It was sort of fun. I had a wig, but I wore it maybe 10-15 times, I liked soft hats better. Hair started back 2-3 weeks after last epirubicn, so during taxol. A lot of it, and it's curly. (It was straight before).  As someone else said, loosing your nose hairs is weird - my nose ran all the time.  I was tired, and the combination of AC and steroids makes your head very fuzzy. My oncologist did a really good job with support meds - I had emend right before chemo and for two days after, and then some navoban (which you don't have in the US), steroids with the AC. They told me to start the laxative the morning of chemo, and my oncologist also prescribed prilosec, 40 mg, which made a huge difference. I also had ativan, though I like xanax better.  The steroids made my moods go up and down, and I ate a lot. No nausea for me. As soon as chemo was over, I started to loose weight though, and I've lost all my chemo weight.   For taxol, I had no problems with my nails. In fact, my nails were stronger than they've been in a while. I had emend before, steroids and two antihistamines via infusion before the taxol. And other than some reflux, I was fine. My onc gave me vitamin b6, and I had a little neuropathy in one foot and some fingers but it's gone.  I didn't have a port, I had a PICC line, which is a central line in the upper arm, held in by tape. It was good for exactly 6 months and it was so much easier for the chemo.   Everyone is different. I didn't have to work, just rested a lot. I also found with steroids that my worst day was generally two days after the chemo when I felt really wiggy and out of it.  CHemo gave me a round, flushed face. It only faded about 2 months after chemo finished. And almost a year later, I'm still a little tired. I tried to walk as much as I could, but I have an arthritic knee, so that sucked.  I found that looking forward to my treatment really helped me a lot. ",
