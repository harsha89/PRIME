I am a nurse and have to step around Doctors all the time.  They range anywhere from the niciest caring people, to the meanest and rudest.  (this goes for nurses, techs, secretaries etc.) I feel, especially with breast cancer, you should at least be able to like any and all people dealing with you.  Our self esteem takes such a punch and then having to put up with rude and nasty people who are supposed to be taking care of you is another insult.  We should never feel we have to bow down to any person taking care of us.  I quit my onc for just that reason.  I found a new one who makes me feel very comfortable, even when giving bad news. The days of treating Drs as if they are Gods is gone.  The new, younger doctors actually deal with this better than those who have been in the field a very long time.  There is also a Hiearchy in the phys. world.  General/Family, Internal Med, General Surgeons, Ortho surg, Heart surg,Neuro surg, brain surg.  They tend to have much bigger attitudes about themselves in that order.  This is not to say they all have crappy bedside manner, but alot do. Surgeons are notoriously cold. I agree with those who said keep your appointments, you will just have to set them up again.  I differ with the opinion to stay with any Dr. you can not handle.  You have time, check around with others who have had surgery, see who they reccomend.  You have the right to feel as good as you can about everything you will be choosing from now on. My best to you and everyone else, Di",

My belief is the docotors don't know everything.  If enough people do not say the same thing to their doctors, how are they going to know?  We all say the same big things, diarrhea, constipation, hair loss, but never the smaller things.  Fortunately I have an oncologist who believes me, such as when I had one treatment of Navelbine.  The neck, jaw, face pain was so bad I almost went to ER.  The on call doctor never heard of it, nor did my Onc, but she researched it and yes, it is a rare side effect. My belief in this whole mess is, if something is way out of the ordinary for you, and you just started a new med, it probably has something to do with the med.  It doesn't matter if it is one of the usual side effects, everyone is different.  I for one am happy to see someone else ask about the jaw clenching.  I bought a $35.00 night gaurd at pharmacy yesterday.  I slept somewhat better and did not have to take Advil this morning. My best to all and Happy New Year, Di PS: I read this site and use it for reference for my visits.  I will tell my Onc, \"well maybe you have not heard of this because you have a smaller group to hear from, but please, go to www.breastcancer.org and see what many women are saying.\"  There are way to many of us saying the same thing one this site, to many many doctors who might be hearing it for the first time.  If your doctor is good enough to look here, they may not poo poo you as much. ",

I talked to my Onc last week, and she is writing an RX for the ring, even though I am \"mildly\" er+. She said it has been ok'd for breast cancer pt's at this time. I debated, but it has gotten to the point the drying is causing pain and chaffing all the time. It makes me angry that , that what makes us women, can kill us, is taken away, and makes you miserable. Looking for some relief! My best to all, Di",

The Abraxane was supposed to shrink those, then I was going to have them either ablated or cryo, but now they say they can not do it.  Changing to Doxil on Tues.

I believe I will try the Xeloda first, just not up for the IV stuff yet. I will also have to stay on Herceptin and Arimidex.  Going to discuss the Arimidex today though. Hoping for good results.
