But I am so glad you reminded me because I have been hearing that the old version of the panel of tests was significantly lacking and now there are a lot more they look for. I meant to ask my doctor about that next time I went in so I am definitely going to ask her Monday on how to get that going.  Thank you so much for reminding me",

The MRI wasn\u2019t as bad as I thought it was going to be, I just hate sitting still that long!! Haha Basically they reconfirmed all the previous biopsies in the right breast from the clips they left in there. Then they found a benign looking intramammary lymph node and told me not to worry about it. I\u2019m not completely sure what that means. And then nothing else new was seen luckily. Then my left breast which has basically given me no problems yet, other than a cyst that was drained, they found a small oval mass. Gave it Bi-Rads score 3 (which is a relief because I usually end up as a 4) and told me to get another ultrasound in 6 months.... so I am very relieved there was nothing scary. But I\u2019m also kind of bummed that this 6month cycle road of new findings is still going round and round. I am starting to think it\u2019s going to be the price I have to pay to stay on top of my health and give me the best shot of finding something very early if I do get it Although I did get my results I haven\u2019t had my follow up appointment with the breast surgeon yet, that will be on Monday. So we will see what she says for the larger growths!",
