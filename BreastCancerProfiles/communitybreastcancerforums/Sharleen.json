I have moles, popped corpuscles, blotchy skin, etc., yet those two black dots really bother me. I think it is a constant reminder of the radiation treatment. I had a lumpetctomy with one lymph node removed, so really only two relatively small scars. The scars don't bother me, but those two black tattoos do. I am going to ask how much it would cost to have them removed the next time I go to the Dermatologist. I suspect I can't afford to have them removed, but I will ask anyway. As soon as they tattooed me I was asking if I could have them removed after the radiation treatments. They looked at me like I was crazy but said the tatts were of no use after the ratiation therapy was completed. I totally understand how you feel. It makes no sense to me, either, but I feel the way I feel and that is that!!! Â Sharleen",
