I opt to have a DEIP FLAP procedure because this did not involve the stomach muscles.  My recovery when well.  This procedure is longer in performing and required a few days stay in the hospital.  Do not give up on deciding, for in the long run, you need to do what you can to feel good about yourself no matter how many options are presented.  I had three opinions before I decided. Your decision is final and no turning back so make sure this is what you want. Find a surgeon and ask lot's of questions, no questions are incorrect questions, this is your one body lets finishing taking care of it the best we can.  We deserve every option out there. Good Luck ",
