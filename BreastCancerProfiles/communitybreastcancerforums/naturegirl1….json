I think I has a sense of calmness about this last test since my last two screenings were essentially clear. I remember the day I found it. I had been out on the lake with my husband. When I came home and changed my hand just kind of went to the lump. I'd had regular breast exams. It seems like it came on suddenly. It's on the left outer side of my breast and kind of floats around. It is really more noticeable to me when I get close to my period, feels slightly painful and swollen. The three weeks after that I can't really feel pain or anything from it although it's still there. I've been worried ever since really I found it. I'm 46 and have older kids and at a point in my life of looking forward to focusing on myself as I have spent years raising kids, foster kids, my husband kids, and I work in social work and have 25 clients daily I am responsible for. I'm trying to figure out how I am going to put on a brave face though this. my husbands mom passed away from breast cancer when he was 19. My clients are pretty perceptive and can tell when something is wrong. I hope I can be brave. I'm trying to keep in mind that I still have decent odds of a benign result. I did question the radiologist and reminded him that the last test he was hesitant about following it diagnostically based on his earlier evaluation. He stated \"well I'm glad you pushed for a follow-up\". I guess that didn't make me feel to confident about him. I looked at my films. The are of concern essentially looked the same 6 months ago, just a lot lighter and maybe a bit smaller but it was there. The surgeon said it looks oddly cystish. I have cysts on my wrist and hands. I can only hope it's benign. I'm al;so thinking he reviews these well before his surgeries and that I can place some confidence in the fact that he thinks it doesn't really look like cancer to him. I'm trying. I've had fibromyalgia since I was 32, then a car accident where I injured my neck. I try to take good care of myself and really just wish for a break from medical stuff. I'm praying for that. I have literally looked at hundreds of ultrasound images comparing mine to them, trying not to obsess, can you relate? I live in a rural area, we do have a breast clinic but I am thinking of traveling a bit for a better facility with more specialists. I live in Michigan so any recommendations would be helpful. I have read than John Hopkins Breast Center will give you an initial insight on the pathology and have the results to you in 24 hours. I am also considering a facility that's willing to do an MRI or 3D mammogram between now and Christmas, just to get more information. Thanks so much for all who replied. It really helps to chat with women who are experiencing this. I felt pretty alone. Marie, I'm glad your results were benign, Star, I will be praying for good results for you. SLV58, keepthefaith & Susan, I am praying for good health for you and I appreciate the replies.  ",

My husband is taking me to a bigger, more specialized clinic tomorrow. I can agree with everyone that the waiting is horrible. Going through a range of emotions that are really intense. Either way I feel like this has been a wake up call for me. I'm doing some writing tonight of a list of things that I want to do, things I have put off, people who I want to see and haven't made time for. I think in the future regardless of how this goes for me I'm going to do things differently. Really makes me realize how precious our bodies are and what a gift life is. I picked up my films yesterday to take with me and have driven myself crazy looking at them, then looking at literally hundreds of Dr. Googles images. Probably a bad idea. My pictures look scary to me but there's no way to know what this is until the biopsy. In the meantime I guess there are no clear answers so I am trying to focus on all the other things it could be, they did give me a list of all the benign conditions at the clinic. It is mobile and does seem to shrink down a bit after my period. I am scared though because it is pretty big, 3cm at least. It started after I started taking a pre-menopausal supplement regularly. My hormones were low, entering menopause. I started the supplement called profema and then my hormones were tested again and the estrogen was up and it was back to normal. I even felt better, then the lump. Its been a bit over a year. I sure hope i didn't wait too long but just went by what the doctor said. If anyone needs prayers tonight I am here for you, tell me and they will be on the way. If you want to pray for me as well I will appreciate it. I really am scared. Sending hugs to all of you and thanking you for being here for me and for eachother. <3",

I called my dr and she called in some Xanax. My bp is up so trying to breath. I had another appointment with the surgeon, while he is pretty concerned, he also says thinks my mass looks multi-cystic to him, wider than tall, ect, but who knows, nobody at this point. I'm trying so hard not to awful-ize this but I just don't know anyone with breast cancer, never thought I'd even have to think about it. I'm scared it's a death sentence. You are all so brave. I always thought I was until now. I'm not sure I can handle this. I live in a pretty isolated area, work too much and feel pretty alone, not much family support. Thank God I have my hubby. So much I still want to do in life, I hope I have the time and I hope the warrior woman in me wakes up here at some point. I've already had a lot of trauma in my life and was ready to enjoy middle age. Still hope for benign or some other odd thing, I'm trying to tell myself that but in the waiting there is a huge sense of doom. I'm sure many of you can relate. Love to all of you who responded and I'm praying for your wellness and happiness. Much love in return. <3",

When I found mine a year ago it was the size of an almond, now tripled. I did all I thought I was suppose to do and ultrasounds showed \"normal breast tissue\" even though you could feel the lump so they sent me away. In retrospect I would have had it removed or insisted on a biopsy, I just didn't have enough knowledge. That info is really the best I've heard in days so seriously, thank you!! Even a bit of hope now is a huge gift for me, even though I know I have to keep it in perspective. I love you ladies and I just smiled for the first time in three days! The day before Christmas eve I met with a radiologist. He told me to try to relax and enjoy Christmas, try not to put the cart ahead of the horse, but to be prepared that in could be the C word. How does one do all of that??  Impossible! Thanks lilly, moonflower & momand2kids & Marie. I was hoping my internet would shut down so I would be unable to continue to look at every ultrasound photo I could find online and compare it to my own trying to identify it!! I'm a researcher and obviously not much self control right now. My surgeon told me he had been looking at these things for 17 years and still couldn't tell... so I shouldn't try to become an expert in a couple weeks, lol! I have to write a grant and be done by tomorrow, hopefully I can focus on that and get it done. Thanks again for helping me feel not so alone in all this. The support here is unbelievable. Really the hardest thing I've been through yet in life...thanks for being here for me.   ",

Head starts spinning about every ache and pain, and I read too many hard and very sad stories. I also probably should have had the biopsy done sooner.  I wanted to make it through the holidays in one piece. I have a bunch of disabled people at work who were counting on me for a big celebration. I guess I didn't put myself first. The waiting built up anxiety, day by day, especially now after the festivities and distractions are over.  By the way, I copied and pasted this quote from you from another thread into a note I could read regularly. I want you to know it has helped in moments of panic, here it is below:  Don't sweat it until you need to. Worrying never changed the outcome of anything, it just steals the joy from today. Lots of women come on these boards who literally make themselves sick for a month or more over something that turns out to be nothing. Try not to do that to yourself. I'm doing this to myself, just like you said, but with help from all of you it's bearable and I'm so glad I came across what you wrote. Thanks for the wisdom Melissa. <3 ",

Maybe it will help us to remember that a 4b is an intermediate suspicion. They're not sure. If they were more certain it was cancer it would be rated higher (4c, or 5). There are alot of strange things that it could be and from my research statistically its in the neighborhood of 70 - 80% chance that it is a benign finding based on your rating and the interpretation of the radiologist. I'm trying to listen to my own words here as well and it's really hard. I was blind-sided as well by my own experience. Keeping you in my thoughts. Glad you were able to have your test moved up.
