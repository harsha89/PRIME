I still need to consult with a medical oncologist, so I don't have a set date yet. I am so glad I found this community. It has been a whirlwind since my mammo on Feb 26th. I had a lumpectomy on March 19th. Clear margins, Clean nodes, type 3, stage 1b, ER+, PR-, HER2- but with my family history we are going the chemo route. (wow I just typed all that like I know what I am talking about LOL). Mom passed away in 1972 with breast cancer. I was 6 yrs old. I am happy we have better technology now. I will be keeping my eye on this community and jumping in at times. Just wanted to say hello and introduce myself. Keep Strong, Shine Bright! Carol",
