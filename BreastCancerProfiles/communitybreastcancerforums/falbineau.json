I've had a biopsy on three masses in both breasts. The surgeon said they are the type that never turn into cancer. The reason I went in the first place was the discharge. Last week, I felt something wet on my gown. My right breast was bleeding. It scared me so much. The breast had been red and swollen. Since last week, it has happened a couple of times. The breast is very tender and there is a burning sensation throughout the breast.. Can anyone help me? My doctor is closed due to water damage from a storm and I have to have a refural to see the surgeon. Please, should I be as concerned as I am? Thank you Log in to post a reply",
