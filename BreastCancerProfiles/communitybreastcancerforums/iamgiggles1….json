I am getting worried about getting my kids back and forth to school and getting to my job. Can anyone help me out and tell me your experience with chemo please. I think the more I am ready for the better, so I can make plans for it. I will be on Taxotere, Carboplatin and Herceptin. Please give me some heads up on side effects that you had. Thank you again for all the wonderful advice and love!!",

I have surgery tomorrow to put my port in for chemo. I went and got a wig today because loosing my hair  was the most stressing to my kids. If I can relieve some of their fears I will do anything. They keep it funny thats for sure. Thank you all for your prayers and concern for me. I am so very grateful for each and everyone of you! I will let you know this weekend what happened. Much Love to you all!!!! Kelly",

They have ordered a petscan for next week. They said they could not stage the cancer untill they get the breast thru mastectomy. All I know is the tumor grade is a 3. My surgeon is presenting my case in front of the board at the hospital Friday. They think it is some part IBC and know it is IDC. Does any of this sound familiar with anybody out there?",
