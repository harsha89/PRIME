I was dealing with the Uterine cancer right when it was time for my annual mammogram (August '10) so did not have one at the time.   Last week I was seeing my regular \"GP\" doctor for a routine visit regarding high blood pressure, which he monitors on a regular basis,  and asked him to give me a prescription for my annual mammo which he did.  (because I had forgot to ask my gyno-oncolgist surgeon about it when I was in for my last post-op PAP back in November, brain turns to mush when feet are in stirrups!) Was shocked when I got a call back saying mammo had come back abnormal.  I had to wait one week to see the GP, which I did yesterday.  I was a mess, crying, scared...it was awful.  (I know I was flashing back to all of the fear and uncertainty I went through for months last year during all the waiting waiting waiting going through the process of having the uterine cancer diagnosed and treated)   ANYWAY....The GP told me that my mammogram showed assymetrical density in the right breast, and also a little spot!  That's what he called it, a \"spot\" and said it was about one-sixth of a millimeter in size.  (can a regular mammogram see anything that small?)  Anyway, nothing can be felt by either myself or the GP checking for lumps..... Alll of my mammos are always done at the same facility and I am going there next week for a breast compression and also an ultrasound. My question to the board is, does this seem like the proper next step?  I guess I wonder because this is all coming from my \"GP\" doctor, not my gynocologist.  I haven't seen HER since I was diagnosed with uterine cancer.  As soon as that started I was referred to a gyno-oncologist surgeon.  He is the person I go to every three months for post op checks and PAP smears... I am wondering if, after the compression and ultrasound, should I make an appt with my regular gynocologist, and have her get the results from the mammo, breast compression, and ultrasound?    The GP doctor (I have known him for years and do trust him)  said that I likely may have to have a biopsy to know what is really going on, he can't tell me for sure right now what is wrong, based just on the original mammogram results.  Someone told me that a GYN doctor would be doing the same thing as my GP...ordering a breast compression, and ultrasound, and then going from there...I just want opinions regarding this, want to make sure the proper steps are being taken.  This would be scary to me in any event, but in view of the other cancer I had I am especially freaked out....MY GP even prescribed a mild tranquilizer for me to take, and I have NEVER had to do that before!   (have to admit it is helping me get through all the waiting) Thanks for any advice, I just want to make sure I am going through the proper steps here.
