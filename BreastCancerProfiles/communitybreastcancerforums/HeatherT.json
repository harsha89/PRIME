Dr told me he could feel the lump but because nothing showed up on either tool, he felt it was just my breast tissue. So on one hand I feel ok, on the other hand I am worried that because my first diagnosis was ALS, and from what I have read, lobular does not always show up on mammo or ultrasound. The dr has agreed to see me in 4 months because he knows I am worried, well OK I burst into tears. I am very discouraged because I have never had anything show up on mammo or ultrasound, even the ALS. Any thoughts or suggestions. P.S. The surgeon was very good about telling me that I did the right thing by coming in.",

I told myself before the appt that I was going to go in and if it didn't show up on anything to push for a MRI, did I do that? no, I chickened out. I had asked for one at a previous appt but the radiologist said my breasts were easy to read on the mammo. Well why didn't they see the area of als, I have had 2 biopsies, one was fatty tissue and the other was ALS and neither showed up on mammo or ultrasound. I am very frustrated and go between feeling like a hypochondriac to feeling like I don't want to be one of those people that just believes the dr's and then find out too late.",

Had a follow-up mammo in November 2007 and I am scheduled for another mammo May 2008.  In January I found another lump in the general area where the excisional biopsy was, I keep hoping it will go away, but it hasn't so my question is, Should I call the Breast Care Center or is it ok to wait for May for my scheduled mammo?  The surgeon said that when he went in he looked around and everything else looked fine. Thanks in advance for your advice. Heather Log in to post a reply",
