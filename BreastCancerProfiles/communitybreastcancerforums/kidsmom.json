Can some of you share your stories after lumpectomies? thank you Kidsmom Log in to post a reply",

I worry about mets also because I originally felt a palpable lump in September 06.  The mammogram did not pick it up, but they did an ultrasound because they could feel it.  The ultrasound tech went and had the radiologist come look at me and he told me the lump was milk left over from me stopping breastfeeding my son 4 months earlier.  He said, nothing to worry about.  I was so realived knowing my mom had already had breast cancer.  He was WRONG!  By May of 07 I had a large painful lump under my left armpit which was more cancer from my original \"milk lump\"  which was of course also cancer.  So I definately am scared about what cancer may have escaped to the rest of my body during those 8 months.  I get my first CT scan post surgery this month.  There was a very small nodule on my lung in the original CT scan but the dr said it was too small to know if it was cancer and its common for people to have small non cancerous abnormalities.  I hope this DR is right. I am praying for all of you! Kidsmom",

I hope your pain lessens and your treatment goes well too, Kidsmom",
