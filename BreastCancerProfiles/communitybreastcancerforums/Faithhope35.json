I'm in Canada where it's not covered. I'm 44yrs old & post menopausal from having my ovaries removed in sept as a preventative measure. I'm 1 yr out from treatment for stage 3 bc & am terrified of recurrence & want to do all I can. Any thoughts?

This is unsettling & im trying to find some peace with it. However, I went on cancer math & plunked in my numbers 5cm, 4 nodes & it said a 42% chance of recurrence. I'm just sick about it!
