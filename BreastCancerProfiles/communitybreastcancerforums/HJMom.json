I was recommended to use Miaderm 3x/day for the duration of the treatments to prevent skin irritation and assit in healing. It does have a floral smell which I dont enjoy but my usually sensitive skin is not reacting negatively in any way to the perfume in it. No fatigue - just a slight skin sensitivity like being in the sun too long on a spring day when you weren't expecting the sun to be strong yet. All very bearable so far!Â ",
