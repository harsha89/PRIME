      "Content": "Dec 21, 2011 07:19AM - edited Dec 21, 2011 07:20AM by Robarue Hello everyone, I had my lumpectomy Dec. 2 and I saw my onco Friday Dec 16 and I start my treatments Jan. 13, 2012.  I will be doing T/C 4X then radiation and hormone blockers for 10 years.  I'm 46 years old and no children and going through peri-menopause.  Now with chemo I'm told it will put me into menopause.  I can deal with sleeping in the tub on ice (lol) but what is scaring me is not knowing how the chemo is going to affect me.  I have IBS with constipation and constipation is last thing I need and I already have a touchy gut with the IBS.  It terrifies me to think I'm going to let someone make me sick so I can get better but I'm going to do it no matter what because I want the 90% chance the cancer won't come back.  If I did radiation and blockers only I'm at 80% and doing nothing more than the lumpectomy leaves me at 65% so it was a no brainer and I know what I need to do, I'm just so very scared not knowing what it will do to me.  Can any of you going through this now or are already done lend me some support on this.  I appreciate it much.",
