      "Content": "mmaring6131 wrote: Six weeks ago I was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma and the tumor was in my right breast and a little over a centimeter.  Subsequent tests followed, including an MRI that has now turned up another small tumor in the left breast.  It's slightly smaller than the one in the right and the original mammogram and ultrasound didn't pick it up at all.  I've still not had surgery and am waiting for the pathology report. I asked the doctor at the imaging clinic how common it is to have tumors in both breasts at the same time and he said it ins't very common. I don't know if this means the cancer has spread or if these are independent tumors.  Has anyone else had this diagnosis?  What sort of treatment plan was recommended? Dx 3/12/2010, IDC, 1cm, Stage I, Grade 2, 0/7 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I don't know the pathology results from the sentinel node biopsies yet but hope to find out on Monday and then I might have a better idea of future treatment.  I'm assuming Tamoxifen but I'd be happy if I didn't have to undergo radiation or other chemo.  There is so much testing and waiting and testing and waiting...",
