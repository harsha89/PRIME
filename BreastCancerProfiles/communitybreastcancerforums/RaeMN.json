I didn't like my first oncologist (saw her on Dec. 3, 2005) so I got in to see another one at a different clinic (Dec. 27, 2005). I too was afraid to go that long, but I was told that your confidence in your oncologist means all the world of difference. And it was right. I started chemo on January 5, 2006 and will never regret my decision to find an oncologist that I connected with.",
