To my amazement, the ultrasound tech pointed out a lump to me and now I'm waiting to have my consultation with a specialist this week to follow with biopsy a week after that. I have 2 small solid lumps , upper outer right breast, about 10 o'clock. I wasn't feeling to worried about the whole thing until I realized that I often have armpit pain on that side. In fact, I woke up this morning with a swollen upper arm on the right.Â  This has happened occasionally and I have written it off as a too tight bra (my right breast is bigger than the left), MSG, or something harmless. Now I am starting to put two and two together and am worried. Has anyone had arm swelling as a symptom?? Thanks for any help. I just turned 39 and was having the time of my life.
