Oh thank you Lord and thank you ladies so much for listening to me, calming my fears and being so kind!! You have all been wonderful! The results showed no sign of malignancy and only fibrocystic changes due to hormonal fluctuations most likely. Will do another mammogram in 6 months to watch the area. Thank you again so much. You are all wonderful. I will continue to check in and hoping to hearing good results for everyone else as well.",

Can someone else make the appt. for me?\" She says, \"We'll see what tomorrow brings.\" WTF? Really Erma? You can't multi task and make an appt? Oy vei!

      "Content": "Mar 8, 2011 07:11PM - edited Mar 8, 2011 08:09PM by OJulie67 I went and saw my doctor today and he said that the new report reads \"undeterminate microcalicfication cluster.\" BI-RAD 4. Biopsy recommended. I do not know the size of the area. He was reading off a faxed over handwritten report from the radiologist...it had not even been dictaphoned yet. I am sooo incredibly scared. My BP was incredibly high and I already take medication for \"genetic high BP\" So he gave me atavan...but I don't take pills like that and don't plan on taking it now. Maybe yoga or something might be better for me. You guys, I am soooo scared. I have two beautiful little girls ages 12 and 7 and a very loving husband who is as devastated as I am and we don't even know anything yet, really! What am I gonna do? I am now waiting on a referral...Gotta love HMO's. They put in an \"urgent request\" for it to speed it along and said I should probably hear from the place in a couple days but that they only do biopsies on Wednesday, so I will probably have to wait another week. I cannot imagine feeling like this for another week. I have already lost 5 lbs in a week and I don't have much meat on me now. My labs they did all came back perfectly normal and \"excellent\" in his words and he said if this does turn out to be anything I am in perfect condition to fight it. :( I should also add that I have implants (saline under the muscle) so I am concerned about how a needle biopsy is done with implants. It is my understanding this is the way they want to go. I have an HMO, so I don't even know what kind of person i am going to \"get\" to do this.",

It has been a circus of losing films between offices, confusion, and just plain- people not doing their job. I am sitting here today hoping that I get the call that everything is set, the radiologist has \"approved\" my films that were delivered by courier this morning. That way they can schedule the biopsy for tomorrow. Otherwise I have to wait until April 13th when they have their next available appt. opening. This has certainly been the biggest nightmare of my life and its crazy to me that other people seem to be in control of my life at this time. I truly don't know how I can continue waiting day after day like this.",

I saw the films and they were so tiny. maybe just about 5 calcs no bigger than the tip of a pin/needle. They were all together in one little area.She said the Calcs all came out with the sterotactic biopsy, along with some tissue samples. They took more mammogram pictures after and they were gone and the little \"chip\" they placed was there instead. This is all so surreal. I'm still super scared, but trying to be hopeful. They told me the 80% benign statistics and gave me a hug and sent me on my way. I sure hope I fall on those side of the odds. How long did it take for you guys to get results? They told me possibly Monday I might know something. I was hoping it might be earlier. The thought of having this twisted stomach another weekend is killing me.",

I want my girls to not suspect anything is going on, so they are the only things that are keeping me somewhat put together. I just can't believe I have to wait to even MAKE an appt. We had such good insurance 3 years ago and I could go anywhere and see any doctor. Than my husband, who is a sheriffs deputy, changed depts. and we had to go with an HMO because our local dept. Didn't offer as good insurance as the state agency he was working for before. So I wait...and then I wait some more. Someone could get VERY sick just waiting. I know you guys all understand and have been here...I just have never had any health issues before...other than my BP and I just don't even know how to handle this level of stress.
