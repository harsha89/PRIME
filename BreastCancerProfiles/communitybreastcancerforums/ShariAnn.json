HELP!!  Silly question...I have surgery August 22nd for a bilat mast and was wondering if the hospital will allow me to wear my turbine (hat) under the surgical cap?  I'm a very self-consious person and nobody...even my husband has NOT seen me without hair.  Also, what about fake eyelashes?  You would think at a time like this you shouldn't care...but I do!  Thanks for your input and/or thoughts.  Log in to post a reply",
