My mom's oncologist told us when it was time for her to look into hospice care.  I would suggest that s/he would be the place to start.  Hospice is very helpful about what changes you will start to observe in your mom.  My mom has liver metastasis but it has also spread to her lungs, pancreas, adrenal gland, and stomach.  The doctor said she probably has about 2 months left.   I would agree with the above posts about talking with your mom's oncologist (are you her medical power of attorney?) as well as finding out if her chemo is considered pallitive.  Perhaps her oncologist did not mention hospice since you need to be finished with curative treatment for hospice to sign on.  Sorry if I have been gloomy or too blunt.  Feel free to message me with any other questions. Take care, Erin",
