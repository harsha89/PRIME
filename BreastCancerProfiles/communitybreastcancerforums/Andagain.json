You are right to be worried. 20 years ago when MRIs weren't even available I had dimpling with negative mammograms and ultrasound. In the end to get an answer I had an excision biopsy of the area and was found to have DCIS. I'm still here to tell the tale. The most important thing is to get a definite diagnosis on why the dimpling is occurring and it looks as if your team is onto it. We'll all keep our fingers crossed for you during this difficult time. Please let us know how you are getting on.",

Latest one 10/10/2010 no real loss of sensation.Â  I've found regular sessions of deep chest breathing while lying on my back helps loosen the tight band feeling and gentle rubbing of the area (hurts more at first) quietens down pain and sensitivity around the scar. It's almost as if you have to tell your brain where the skin surface is.",
