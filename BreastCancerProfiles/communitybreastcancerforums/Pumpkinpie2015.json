Last week my left breast started to hurt and I noticed a small area around my nipple was red, hot to touch so I decided to do a self exam. My left breast feels much more 'lumpy' compared to my nice soft right breast. I have breast fed before so now my boobs are not pert at all and upon lifting them, I could see a strange crease from my nipple to right under to my armpit, my right breast does not have this happen. I took myself off to the gp who examined me and said she could feel two lumps and would like to refer me to breast clinic. The appointment has come through very quickly and is next Friday. I suppose what my concern is is this strange crease. Did anyone who has been diagnosed or better still not diagnosed have a crease like it? Could I possibly email someone the pic to put my mind at ease? Thank you for the taking the time to read, I'm pretty much in the state of mind of thinking about it non stop x Log in to post a reply",
