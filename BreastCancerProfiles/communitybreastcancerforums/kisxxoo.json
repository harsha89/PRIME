Tylenol is like putting a bandaid on a bullet wound and the vicodin is no longer working. I had a terrible allergic reaction to the nuelasta shot, hives EVERYWHERE!!! Spent the entire weekend sleeping because i had to take benadryl constantly just to keep it under control (Steroids didnt really help until today). I have been able to work which helps keep me sane, there is only so much day time tv you can watch lol.  My first round was pretty rough, but still do able, my second round was by far the worst but i think that was from hip pain from the nuelasta shot, and hives a week later. This third round has been pretty easy and i seem to be bouncing back much quicker. Time has definetly flown by! i look back thinking how axious i was for my first treatment and how long it would be until my last and now its right around the corner! I will have a bmx in March and hoping for to have reconstruction right away.",
