I'm a week from completing my chemo treatments and need to decide on radiation. I have the same knee jerk reaction to undergoing radiation. I've been a smoker forever and really don't want to trade breast cancer for lung cancer. So far I feel I have been agressive in my treatment. I was diagnosed at age 45 with Stage II 5cm Invasive Lobular Carcinoma with 3 lymph glands out of 6 involved. I was ER/PR+ HER2-. I had a bi-lateral mastectomy, even though the cancer was only one one side, just to make sure the sneaky stuff wouldn't come back. I opted for the chemo, even though I had clear margins after the surgery. My tumor markers during treatment have been consistently down around 17/18. I've read other studies that say radiation to the chest wall in smokers (or ex-smokers) can raise the risk of developing lung cancer http://jco.ascopubs.org/cgi/reprint/18/6/1220.pdf. What I can't seem to find is how much does having radiation reduce the risk of recurrance. Does anyone have any information on that? I mean does having the radiation treatment reduce recurrance by 10%, 30%, 90%?? It's hard to completely weigh the risk without having both sides of the story. I did meet with the Radiation Oncologist right after surgery and was upfront with her about my smoking and she strongly recommended radiation. ??? Not sure why she thinks it's a good idea given my history, but I didn't ask that question during the appt. I talked to my Chemo doc about my concerns and he agreed that it is a valid concern but said that I should meet with the radiation oncologist one more time to make my final decision on treatment. I need to make that appt soon but want to go to the appt with all the info in hand. Any additional information any one has would be greatly appreciated.",
