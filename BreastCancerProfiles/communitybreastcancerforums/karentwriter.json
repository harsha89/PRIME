And they might just wait til my appointment tomorrow to discuss the results. I'm in the middle of a panic attack thinking they are making me wait til I\"m there because it's bad news. Like really bad. Is it normal for them to do more stains without it being a bad result? I don't deal well with this kind of thing. I feel like i\"m going to puke right now. They had told my family that no news was good news, but that was not the case on the initial diagnosis. They waited another day or two to call me and it was bad news...obviously.
