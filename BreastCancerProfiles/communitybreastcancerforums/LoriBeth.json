My BS told me that even if my mass was B9, it would still have to come out...so wouldn't it make more sense to just do a lumpectomy and biopsy that rather than making me go through different biopsies??  This is sooooooooooooooo frustrating and scary!!!!!!!",

Any comments will be very welcome!!!",

The radiologist himself came in and did another ultrasound, and told me he found a couple areas of concern.  He spoke with my GP, and I have been referred to a surgeon for a wide excision biopsy.  I am scared to death! I haven't been able to eat much, and sleep is darn near impossible!!  My meeting with the surgeon is on 2/9/12, and then I assume the surgery will be scheduled soon?  I am feeling so many emotions~I am 42 years old, and feel angry, petrified, and in a state of shock that this could even be happening.  I have read some of the posts on here, and I am hoping that some of you that have been through this can give me some advice on how to get through the waiting and the stress. Thanks and God Bless~ Lori Beth Log in to post a reply",

Finding out you may have breast cancer HAS to be one of the worst things a woman can go through.  And, I agree with you both that the waiting is the worst!!  My mind has been running non-stop about this, and it's hard to make myself focus on something else. I have cleaned, then cleaned, and cleaned some more...lol.  Nights are the worst though~even with the tv on, my mind just goes right back to this.  I wish you both the best of luck~and hope you will keep in touch...we are all in this together!",
