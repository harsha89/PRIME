I have had a hard lump the size of a clenched fist after my lumpectomy 6 years ago. Massage was impossible, it was so tightly wrapped. Lately, I just happened upon taking serapeptase, 120,000 units, 3 times a day, (you can order it over the counter online at Amazon and other places) and it is actually going away. I can literally feel it dissolving. It feels like very faint \"buzzing\". No, I am not kidding. Check into it.",
