We leave on vacation on Saturday and the nurse pushed her to have the US before we left. So my question to you is should I be more concerned at the urgency of this US and the quickness of the call back? This was her first Digital Mammogram and she has had fat deposits on the breast in the past...... I am sooooo sorry that I am rambling....... Just upset and scared for my mom, Log in to post a reply",
