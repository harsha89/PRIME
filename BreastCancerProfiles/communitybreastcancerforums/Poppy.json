To add to this story, this woman's husband had cancer last year and has just had a scare... I don't know much, but there's a possiblility of a new primary or mets... and he's been in the hospital. I think, after taking today to mull this over (and get some great advice) I'm going to bring something to eat to her tomorrow. I can use her husband's situation as the \"excuse\" and just see what happens. If she brings the BC up, great. If she doesn't, then I'm with y'all that maybe it's the daughter's fears more than the mom's. Thank you all - I knew I'd get great advice here! And on a side note, what happened to all of my posts? I haven't posted much recently, but I KNOW I've posted more than 377 times! I think I did that in my chemo months alone! lol xo Erica",

If JE wants to put his personal life out there as the family man during the \"good times,\" then he's fair game when something bad is exposed. I won't even go into the hypocracy of the \"family values\" JE touted, there are 6-8 million dollars of campaign funds in question at this point (not to mention the $15,000/month that was paid to his baby mama.) That affects everyone who donated money to his campaign. He also had one of his staffers (who is married) take the heat for this baby. While the guy was stupid to get involved, what do you do when your boss is running for president and you really truly believe in the guy? The holder of the position of President of the United States SHOULD be held to a higher standard. It's doesn't mean he's not human, but his core values and actions should be honorable. JE is a slimy trial lawyer who has made multi-millions by exploiting women and children in class action lawsuits. Now he's cheated on his wife after so publically presenting himself as a wholesome family man. He's a LIAR and a scumbag. If Elizabeth Edwards lurks or posts at BCO I'd like to say that I am truly sorry you have to endure the stress of this horrible situation and there are thousands, if not millions, of women out there who are supportive of and thinking of you.

My neighbor's daughter, who is visiting from out of state, stopped my husband in the street last night and told him her mom has just been dx with BC. The daughter knew I'd had it and though no one in the neighborhood knows about her mom's dx, my hubby got the impression the daughter was hoping the news would get back to me so I would talk to her mom. My question is this - do I go over there today or call and say that the daughter told us? I would never tell anyone else in the neighborhood w/o her permission, but there is another BC survivor here too. Or, do I not say anything b/c she doesn't want the neighbors to know? I wouldn't want this woman to be upset with her daughter but at the same time, I think she HAS to need someone to talk to. Her treatment (rads only b/c she doesn't want to lose her hair... oh how we've all been there, but can I keep my opinion on that one zipped??) will be about an hour away and she might need someone to take her. I feel like I could be a good patient advocate for her - or someone she could cry or scream to... ask questions of... but I am conflicted b/c of how this information came to me.  Any advice??

Some stuff was in the attic (college photos, a favorite shirt), some in his office (the bobblehead Snoopy from the 70's) and some was stuff I saw every day. When I was a kid, he smoked a pipe. He had tons of pipes. I have them - but the thing I keep out is the leather tobacco container. Even after all of these years, if I open it, I smell the tobacco he smoked when I was a kid. I have a lot of his things and a lot is in storage, but over the years I have sussed out the precious items that keep his memory alive and those things are a part of my home. His old polo shirt that he did yard work in is one of my favorite \"junky shirts\" to wear. I can't offer advice on what to do, only that you might have no idea what is meaningful to your family. I have an old jelly glass with Bugs Bunny on it and my husband has claimed it as his own. He says he can see me running around with it as a kid. I know when I'm gone, that glass will always remind him of me but that's only b/c he told me! Otherwise, it might've gone in the Goodwill pile long ago. At 5 and 10, your boys are old enough to tell you what reminds them of you. You could ask them what items, scents, vacations, etc... they think of when they think of you.  If a certain trip or occasion jumps out as special to one of them, you could maybe frame a picture from that time for that child. I don't know the answer, but I just didn't want you to overlook the seemingly unimportant things that might just be the most valuable. Hugs Erica",

I was watching 60 Minutes tonight while waiting for Big Brother to come on (CBS was running late) and thankfully so. There was the most interesting story! This might be on CBS.com but I didn't check. This is a gross summary of the story but I swear I was almost in tears watching it. There's this man who is fighting terminal cancer (lymphoma I think) and he built radios as a kid. He knew that radio waves heat metal but are safe to people. So one night - in a chemo induced state - he started banging around in the kitchen with the pots and pans. His poor wife thought he'd lost it but he ended up building something that they say is working! Basically they inject gold particles into a tumor and the metal binds to the tumor but not normal cells. Then they shoot radio waves at the tumor and it kills it but doesn't do anything to the healthy cells. I guess the radio waves heat the metal (which cooks the cancer cells but no others). Can you imagine being able to treat cancer as easily as that?!!! It was so amazing. They said it'll probably be 4 years before they have the means to treat metastatic cancer but HELLO, that is so simple and 4 years is not that long. For metastatic cancer they showed a computer model of injecting a bazillion teeny tiny gold particles into the bloodstream. The gold finds the tumor cells and binds only to them. Then - radio waves cook the cells. Right now MD Anderson and one other research hospital are working with this machine and I hope they can get the injection stuff worked out quickly...they say it will treat (or cure supposedly) all kinds of cancer. AMAZING. Hopefully this poor man will live long enough to see his machine in action! Hugs Erica Log in to post a reply",

I'm coming up next w/e...I have to do some shopping but I could settle on Starbucks or lunch if you don't have time/inclination. I have a Christmas thingie on Sunday but if you're free the 13th, PM me with your cell # and I'll give you a call.  I accidently destroyed my last phone and lost your digits! Holidays are stressful - and this year I think more so than in a long while. You've got THE best attitude I think of anyone I've met on my BC journey so I am keeping the faith that this outburst is about a lot of stuff... not really you. Love you K-Dog! :D Erica",

What you're feeling is completely normal and I encourage you to come to this site and ask every question and post every fear! Check the chemo threads and see if there's one for the month you will start chemo. If there isn't, start one! There will be women who will be going through the same stuff at the same time and it's a wonderful support (and maybe you'll make some lifelong friends). The BC diagnosis is so overwhelming... just remember that the surgeries and treatments are there to save your life. When I was going through A/C-T chemo I thought it would never end. Now, over 3 years since I finished treatment, it's a distant memory. I also encourage you not to search the internet for answers. The internet is great, but it's a scary and sometimes misinformed place. BCO is a safe place to ask the questions. If you want more information about a drug or information that someone here gives you, then go to the internet. Hang in there... what surgery will you be having? There are a lot of things you can do to make post-surgery more comfortable and the ladies here know them all! xoxo",

I was watching 60 Minutes tonight while waiting for Big Brother to come on (CBS was running late) and thankfully so. There was the most interesting story! This might be on CBS.com but I didn't check. This is a gross summary of the story but I swear I was almost in tears watching it. There's this man who is fighting terminal cancer (lymphoma I think) and he built radios as a kid. He knew that radio waves heat metal but are safe to people. So one night - in a chemo induced state - he started banging around in the kitchen with the pots and pans. His poor wife thought he'd lost it but he ended up building something that they say is working! Basically they inject gold particles into a tumor and the metal binds to the tumor but not normal cells. Then they shoot radio waves at the tumor and it kills it but doesn't do anything to the healthy cells. I guess the radio waves heat the metal (which cooks the cancer cells but no others). Can you imagine being able to treat cancer as easily as that?!!! It was so amazing. They said it'll probably be 4 years before they have the means to treat metastatic cancer but HELLO, that is so simple and 4 years is not that long. For metastatic cancer they showed a computer model of injecting a bazillion teeny tiny gold particles into the bloodstream. The gold finds the tumor cells and binds only to them. Then - radio waves cook the cells. Right now MD Anderson and one other research hospital are working with this machine and I hope they can get the injection stuff worked out quickly...they say it will treat (or cure supposedly) all kinds of cancer. AMAZING. Hopefully this poor man will live long enough to see his machine in action! Hugs Erica Log in to post a reply",
