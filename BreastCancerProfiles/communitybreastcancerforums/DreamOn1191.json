She is going to undergo a double mastectomy and reconstruction in the next two weeks. Today she had her chest, abdomen, and I believe the third one is pelvis, CT scanned which was ordered by her oncologist. The scan happened at 3pm today and she was already called tonight saying she has an appointment two days from now at 9:45 am with her oncologist. She's scared.. I understand that she doesn't know exactly what the appointment pertains to but she feels it's so soon to already have the results of her CT scan. Is it normal to have an appointment that soon to already discuss the CT scan results? Is it bad that the oncologist wants to see her already? What is your experience with receiving your CT scan? Thank you all and God bless. Fight! Log in to post a reply",
