Unlike some of the women here, I am on leave from work.  I couldn't imagine standing up for more than an hour or two, and I really have \"chemo brain,\" but stickee notes do well, and I'd like to believe that this is my repreave from superwoman multitasker time!  I wish you well with your treatment.  Share your thoughts with your medical team and enjoy that first wedding anniversary.  My husband and I celebrated our 28th on the telephone as I was on my was home from the MRI that day!  Just an aside:  I have also insisted that my potassium and magnesium levels by watched more closely. I also have diabetese and high blood pressure, so some of the componds my healthstyle plan.  I have broke the bank and order a food blender/with the motor of a lawn mower, so I plan to rethink all my eating patterns and needs.  I am not a vegie fan, but i can do vegie soups and mushy vegie things.  I'd been told to stay away from coffee and all soy products and introduced raw nuts and took out much meat.  I hear about awesome diet programs with much success, but my first line of therapyare the big guns (chemo, etc.) and have added the complimentary pieces as I find them...or they find my.  Brandon Bays writes a remarkable book, THe Journey and there is a form of healing called \"Theta Therapy.\"  that has suppored some people's needs. And if you hear of options I'd appreciate hearing about it.  I absolutely know that the power of hope is indeed the more critical piece of all of this and there and books to read and women here to talk to.  Let's keep in touch sunny....from one woman recovering from mets to another....yes, I head people say they can't cure mets, yet, but, hmmmm, maybe the patient can somehow contribute too!!! Best to you and HAPPY 1St...and MANY MANY MORE, Deb",

(I live in Canada so the rules of the game are a bit different.) I opted to have her present to her peers and went with that second opinion because it built on her recommendation.  But what reallly led me was my gut!  I know that sounds less than scientific, but everything I have read since says \"if you don't FEEL good with the first or second opinion, get a third\" and \"oncologists are making educated decisions, but few two will present the same options even to two patients who look exactly the same.\"  Wow...doesn't that make it even more confusing? I have been told NOT to compare my treatment plan with someone with a similiar health profile.  The bottom line for me is: if it ain't working, can we change it?

I have directed myself to not think about cancer or read or write about it on certain days, sometimes for shorter periods....I sometimes have to PLAN to not include cancer and deliberate living as part of the day.  I am also looking at whether or not to use anti depressants.  My doc wants me to try Effexor, but I am worried it will have me in an emotional limbo-land or a fog.  Do you know if that is a realistic concern?  I'd be interested in hearing your experience. Ladies: I REALLY appreciate you taking the time to share your experiences.  I honestly benefit from a gentle or even a swift \"get on with living and $crew cancer!\" comment....it DOES help!  I share the belief that health and survival is very much based on our mental ability to go on, though that does NOT equate to anyone \"failing\" when cancer gets the best of them.  And up until Christmas and starting Tamoxifen, I was able to achnowledge the \"glass half full\"....even through out chemo...so I guess I am wondering what triggered the most recent \"bottom outs.\"  I DID find another thread with similar concerns...so I need to keep talking to others and benefiting from their experiences.  And I know its a downer subject, but thanks again for your help....all of you!  Blessing and hugs, Debra M.",
