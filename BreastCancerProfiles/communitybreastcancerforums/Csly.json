Said yes I feel it and can see it right here and then the report says noting about anything just that findings do not show signs of any reason for the palpable mass I described :( and even though the lady asked if I had ever been told that I have fiberocystic breasts there I see no mention of that or the density. Both of my scanshave identical reports. Are there benign reasons that could explain a small lump that stay said for three years a day has some indentation when flexing pectoral muscles I just hate to have things done or have a doctor feel like I am Wasting his time",

And then just talked about how frustrating it is to be told we feel it but see nothing.",
