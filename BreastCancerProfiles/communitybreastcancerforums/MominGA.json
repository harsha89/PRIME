The biopsy from the surgery was clear and no further ADH found. However, I'm coming up on my 6 months in just about 4 weeks and worry too. I am amazed at how many women there are with the same dx. I am 51 and no family history and in very good health but it seems that it doesnt matter much anymore, this can be anyone. I do believe in positive thoughts and prayer. I'm sorry that anyone has to worry and have this on their mind for the rest of their lives but it is nice to know we have others who can support and understand so we're not alone. Has anyone had a diagnosis of 5 or more years that can tell us how it has gone for you and hopefully have a good success story without reoccurrence? Prayers for good health for us all. Thanks so much for sharing on here, it does bring a little comfort.",
