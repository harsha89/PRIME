      "Content": "Apr 28, 2009 09:27PM - edited Apr 29, 2009 06:59AM by tweekerbeeker well, there really is a point to being tested. First of all, a family history of ovarian cancer is VERY suspicious for BRCA+. As d5Holmes pointed out, that is a very sneaky disease(and quite awful too-you wouldn't wish it on your worst enemy). There are no really reliable tests for it, and it usually is not found until very late. No, there is no guarentee that if you are BRCA+ you will get it, but if you have your ovaries removed your chances will be greatly reduced. And as far as the ppc you mentioned (the \"other\" form of OC), that is even more rare. Removing your ovaries by 40 not only reduces your risk of OC, but also greatly reduces your risk of BC. I assume that you know that triple neg. tends to be very agresssive and fast growing-that is probably the reason your doctor is suggesting the test. Your chances of having it reoccur or having a new primary in the other breast are higher if you are BRCA+. That said, genetic testing is a very difficult and personal decision. I urge you to consider it, and please be sure you see a Certified Genetic Counselor. This is a specially trained person medically and also trained to help people deal w/ this kind of news. As suggested earlier, you can go to www.facingourrisk.org and get help finding a CGC. As for the mastectomies-they are difficult emotionally-no doubt about it. But you can have reconstruction, which can be quite natural looking and feeling. I had bilateral mastectomies in Feb. and no regrets. I had a hard time making the decision, and hired a psychologist, but I am soooo relieved now to know how much I have reduced my risk. If you go to the top of your screen, you can get a members list. Type in CarynRose, who is also triple negative-and read her posts. Then you will understand why testing is so important. Please go to your library and take out \"Pretty is What ChangeS\" -the true  story of a young girl who finds out she is BRCA+. I make all these suggestions b/c it is so important.  Only you can decide-but please get the facts b4 you decide. Good luck. Feel free to send me a pm.",

He had 2 daughters-1 died in her forties-no one seemed sure why. His other daughter-my grandmother -was in her 70's with no cancer. Out of nowhere, my mother was diagnosed stage 4 BC. She had no risk factors that we knew of (this was in 1979)  and we were so confused. She was postmenopausal and had had a hyterectomy. She died in 1981, age 59. Shortly thereafter, her sister was dxed w/ ovca. Still no connection (no gene testing yet available). No other family history. My ob/gyn tells me not to worry-different unrelated cancers. Grandma dies of pneumonia at 93. fast forward to 2000. My younger sister is diagnosed w/ melanoma. Another \"unrelated\" cancer.My new pcp tells me about brca and suggests that family history may indicate it. If it were not for my aunt w/ ovca,they would have thought my mother's was sporadic. I decline the test, but am watched carefully. I did not consider this a strong history. According to Myriad's online calculator, I had a 5% chance of being positive, they do not recommend testing unless you are 10% at risk. 2008-I need a biopsy!!! (post-menopausal, mind you). I rethink the testing thing for my daughter's sake,sure that I will be negative, but wanting the assurance in a test result. Mind you, all these people are dead now-including 2 of my mother's brothers who also died of stomach cancer(unrelated, right?). No one has been tested, still they now recommend it for me. Lo and behold, I am brca2+. That was a shock and sent me reeling for months. It is NOT just a piece of information-it is life-changing. I could easily have been an uninformed neg.-good thing I took the test! You could be uninformative neg-what would you do, considering your history? You could be positive-what would you do? This is heavy information. I really don't understand why they counseled your mom against it either. Were you two seen by a Certified Genetics Counselor? Not nurse oncologist, surgeon or oncologist-REAL, GENUINE, Board-certifed CGC? Well, I hope you are able to decide what to do, and if you get tested, what to do with the results. Good luck!",

HellofromCT, you did not mention your age, which could indicate a need for further testing, but your family history might indicate the need. I strongly think the best thing for you would be to see a Certified Genetics Counselor before you make a decision. They are the experts in such matters-not even oncs. can keep up w/ this rapidly-changing field. If you need help finding one, you can PM me. I did have a pbm in Feb. b/c I am brca2+. I found out in May 08, and could not live with any other option. It took quite a while to accept the decision, which I do not think you can rush. I am very pleased with my decision, though I was terrified about it before-hand. I woke up in recovery so relieved that it was not nearly as bad as I had imagined, and so glad not to have to think about it anymore!! If you are in DC, there are great surgeons in Baltimore who do DIEP. I know many who have had this recon and are very pleased and had minimal pain. I recommend that all of you who posted so far read The Breast Reconstruction Handbook by Kathy Steligo. Knowledge will help dispel fear. Also check your local library for a copy of Pretty Is What Changes by Jessica Queller. Taraleec, I had the recon you are talking about-the latissimus dorsi flap. I am VERY happy with the results. If you do this, be sure that you investigate it thoroughly and that your surgeon does MANY of these on a regular basis. You should also consider genetic testing(or at least genetic counseling) b/c of your young age. PBM is a big decision-consider a therapist who deals with medical decision-making. I am so glad I did this. Also, you might want to check out www.facingourrisk.org , a site devoted to hereditary cancer. Best of luck to you all.",

I ask b/c a genetics counselor is really the expert in this field. She could discuss the significance of family history with you, and help you better understand your risk. Has anyone in your family who has had cancer been tested? If not, then your result may not be that informative. You may still have a higher than average risk because of family history. If they have tested positive, then you are a true negative and at average risk. Please see a CGC if you have not already, and bring a family history along with your test results. Good Luck, and keep us posted.",

Regarding genetic counseling, it may still be good for you, even if you have decided. The main benefit would be to your children. My docs had assured me that I would probably not be positive either-but oncologists are not the specialists. I am 53 nad found out last year. My mom had BC when she was 57, died at 59. Doctors said probably not brca because she was post-menopausal. They were so wrong! (and shocked, I might add. Insurance should cover a pbm for high-risk, even if not brca+. Good luck to you!!",

The main thing is that you alone must decide how much risk you can tolerate. You doctors should let you know that surveillance does not =prevention, and that if they do find cancer again, there are no guarentees that they will find it at an early stage or that they will be able to treat it effectively. I am doing well after my surgeries, but I did enlist the help of my CGC and a psychologist at the cancer institute before my mastectomties. My PS was great, and I look and feel like they are MY breasts. If you have not done so already, read The Breast Reconstruction Handbook by Kathy Steligo. Also, check out www.facingourrisk.org.  ",

This is now. There are hard decisions to make, but now we have choices. Like you, the thought of losing my ovaries(I will opt for complete hysterectomy) is not nearly so bad as the thought of losing my breasts. HOWEVER-the literature by Myriad labs says the risk is more like 85% for breast cancer-WAY too high for me. And if there is not a mastectomy, the chance of a 2nd cancer in the same breast in less than 5 years is quite high, and generally a person would develop cancer in the contralateral breast. That's a lot of risk. Surveillance could be an option, but you never know at what stage they will find it, or where. will let you know my couse of action soon.Wish the best for you!! ",
