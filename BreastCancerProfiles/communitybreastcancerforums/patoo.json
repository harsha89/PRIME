Interesting that you reached 50 because comments elsewhere (other, older, threads) had some reporting no success in raising their D with the weekly Vit D2 shots. Because of that many of us passed up doing the weekly 50K of Vit D2 in favor of OTC Vit D3 supplements. Like Spookiesmon, for at least a year I have been taking 5000 daily of liquid Vit D3. Having blood work next week and hopefully I'm above the 38 last tested. Since I'm now in Florida I may cut back but will still stay at least at 2500 daily. Again, answers to how much is good or too much or even necessary at all, is all over the place, good, bad, indifferent.",
