Nothing in the brain, either. But clearly, something new will come on the heels of the end of this therapy. I just hope the next one beats this into submission. When I figure out where my adult child will land in the future, I will likely find a qualified hospital there, and just move. One a good note: the radiologist thought I'd had a tumor excised because it disappeared. So, there's that -- and no brain mets, either.",

      "Content": "Ojttocs wrote: Since my Stage IV dx two weeks ago, I formulated a mental plan to be reevaluated by the \"best cancer hospital\" in the nation, MD Anderson. Maybe I'd transition my care down there, as my daughter lives in TX and I no longer need to live any one location. It seemed like a strong plan. As of Sept 1, they no longer see patients for second opinions, only clinical trials. I admit I hung up on the caller. I'm so furious; I'm not even sure at what, except that I can't get a break. The doctors missed my cancer, staring them RIGHT IN THE FACE, for months. This includes my beloved oncologist. They won't do surgery now, because I'm Stage IV, even though it is confined to the breast and my skin around it. Now my chance to be treated at the \"best cancer hospital\" in the nation, maybe the world, has evaporated. I'm soo angry. I'll give you all a little background, since I'm new here. I was dx'd with stage I wayyy back in 1996. I had a lumpectomy, 23 lymph nodes removed (clear) and radiation combined with CMF therapy. That was all for decades. In 2012, I was dx'd with thyroid cancer. Had it removed. I was stage III there, but only because I was one year older than a certain protocol provided. I had a couple of compartment lymph nodes, two in they thyroid, all gone. I've been stable but highly suppressed since. In 2014, my routine mammo showed something, and off I went. Now I just can't beat it and it gets worse and worse. I had the left mastectomy, and didn't remove the right. I had horrible chemo that nearly killed me due to an allergic reaction. The left side didn't want to heal, and there was this...spot. I dx'd as stage 1, recurrent and went NED. I took tamoxifen for a while, till my heart started palpitating. I had my genes tested (BRCA2) and removed my right breast and my ovaries. The spot developed other bumps and spots. All of these were monitored by my docs. Now, dx'd two weeks ago: a tumor in both sides, a little over a cm each, and my skin...all cancerous. I'm now stage IV metastatic. They won't do surgery. They want me on Herceptin, Perjeta and my personal fav, Taxol. Well, ladies, what am I in for? Think I can still work like my doctor says I can? Where can I catch a break? Seriously??

      "Content": "Oct 12, 2016 09:26PM - edited Oct 12, 2016 09:28PM by Ojttocs I really appreciate everyone's input. I'm sort of overwhelmed;still sorting things out. I didn't realize the chemo was forever, for instance. Well, not forever, but no longer just hit and run. I feel (for maybe the first time in decades) completely uninformed and out of control. I know, I need to fix that myself. No one advocates as well as I do. The surgeon's office confirmed what y'all said just today...over two weeks later. I will be evaluated for surgery later. I find the thought that lymph systems that remain behind serve as a conduit, so the horse really is out of the barn, makes a lot of sense. That's why the mastectomy didn't stop it. That the Taxol won't be as hard (I nearly died from Taxotere) also helps. And your negative experience with MD Anderson...very comforting, although I'm sorry it was so awful. But I'm not ready for this. (I also know: who is?) My affected area is still relatively limited. I feel like I could still beat this for a while longer. I liked that illusion. I feel like it is slipping. I have no idea what to expect, and suddenly I've gone from focus of care to almost persona non grata medically. Last round, I got all sorts of attention and training and lord knows what...this time almost crickets until I complain. Tonight I found myself confessing my status to a total stranger who had a pink ribbon shirt on. I asked about it, she told me she lost her mom and is watching a friend with Stage IV struggle...and the faucet began to flow. I was hoping for inspiration, and I ended up...dear heavens! Well, I met a new friend. I do want to transition care down from Michigan to Austin, TX. Any thoughts? Has anyone done something like this? Thanks, dear sisters.",
