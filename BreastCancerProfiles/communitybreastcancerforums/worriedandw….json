What I meant was that since reading the posts about Paget's here, it has become clear to me that it can mimic other conditions and doctors cannot identify it by sight, only by biopsy. I read quite a few stories where doctors were sure it wasn't Paget's and it ended up being so (I know probably because it is rare). I will look at that thread for waiting anxiety, thanks for sending it!",

I know with Paget's that means little, so I'm quite anxious for the punch biopsy scheduled in two days. Then it's a week or more wait. I can't handle this waiting! I just want to hibernate until I know the results. One thing that is curious, I no longer have any itching. The areola is just slightly redder than the other, although I'm not remembering what it used to look like quite honestly. I've spent so much time analyzing my breasts over the past few weeks.",
