      "Content": "Nedlewrkr76 wrote: Hello everyone, I just had my first mammogram last week (15th) and the next day the center called me back to tell me I needed a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound. I was not able to get much information from the woman on the phone because I was traveling at the time. Basically she just said that they found something abnormal and that they wanted to check it out. She then asked me if I was driving, and when I told her I was in the car but my daughter was driving, the call disconnected. I'm sure that was just because of the cell service, but it did freak me out a bit. I called my doctor to get her to call in a referral that afternoon. It took them until today to get back to me and get a diagnostic mammogram scheduled (no ultrasound like I was told from the screening center). So that appointment is on the 31st. In the meantime, the radiologist put the result up. To be completely honest I am confused about the wording that was used. \"an area of possible nodularity likely in the upper outer quadrant located 13 cm from the nipple\". I am trying not to worry because I know the odds are that there is nothing wrong. I actually feel silly even posting this when so many others have more serious concerns. BTW, I am 40yrs old and a mother of 2 teen girls. The report said that my breasts have scattered fibroglandular tissue. I was also told that since my boobs were so large that they would have to do extra images. (i think they did 8 total) Thank you all for listening to my ramblings. Log in to post a reply",

Sometimes my mind runs to the worst case scenario. It definitely helps to get it off my chest, so to speak. I am trying to not think too much until I have the next test done. And hopefully i will get the \"nothing to worry about\". :)",
