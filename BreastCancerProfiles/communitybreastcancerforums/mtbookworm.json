The worst part of the whole ordeal was the four attempts it took to get my IV in and having to wait in pre-op for five hours. By then I was ready to be done with the surgery! When I came to after surgery my family couldn't believe how well I looked. It really helps that my left are is feeling much strong so I can baby the right side but still be able to do things. Am a bit bumbed that I can't shower because of the big bandage over the dissection site but my mom has been here taking care of me so either her or my husband can wash my hair in the sink. Now just have to wait for the pathology reports and I meet with the oncologist next Friday to see what the next step is.",

One last hurdle to get over. There was a small abnormality on my chest x-ray that I had the day before my BMX. Dr doesn't think it will be anything but ordered a CT scan just in case. They actually had an opening immediately and I had it done (quite painful placing my arms over my head for the scan). Later on I got to thinking, I had a surgical marker placed when I had my biopsy done. Could this have shown up on the x-ray? I will feel kind of stupid but relieved if that is what it turns out to be. Wish I didn't have to wait the whole weekend to find out.",

I think its just the aftermath of having to \"have it all together\" to get through the surgery. I start my Tomoxifen tomorrow which scares me but the thought of not taking it scares me more. I started physical therapy this week and that is a tremendous help. The therapist works on massaging and moving my arms to regain range of motion but also massages the area around the tissue expanders to help strech the skin and relieve some of the discomfort from them. She also work to move the lymphatic fluid away from where I had lymph nodes removed to drain it another way. If you have the opportunity to do physical therapy I say go for it, just make sure they are experienced with your situation.",

It's just a bit uncomfortable afterwards while the skin stretches, kind of like having braces tightened. I'm seeing a physical therapist two days a week and she really helps with massage to stretch the skin around the tissue expanders. I was an A cup and hoping for a C cup. I've had four fills so far and have at least three more to go. Can't wait for the exchange!",

The sentinal node biopsy looked clear but I got my pathology report back yesterday and it showed a tiny area less than 1mm of cancer in one of the nodes so I am back into surgery today to remove the rest of the nodes. I am scared to dealth to go back into surgery, I was just feeling good after the first surgery so the thought of more is scary. One positive note is I slept like a log last night so feel better rested physically and emotionally ready than I did last night. I'm also now dreading the week it will take to get back the pathology report. Anyway thanks for letting me ramble.",

On April 22nd I met with surgeon and found out that one of the two nodes removed was involved. I went back into surgery on the 23rd for a AND. At first I was so scared and weepy about having surgery again but it ended up not being that big of a deal. Much less pain than the first surgery. For me my left side had started to heal so at least I had one \"good\" arm. I got the first two drains out Monday so now just have the one from the second surgery. Little nervous about what will come back in the second pathology report but otherwise I'm doing good. It was a little weird after having the nodes removed you have kind of an indent where the nodes and fat was removed, glad my husband saw it and warned me before I saw it. Hang in there and know that the AND is doable. Heather P.S. One nice thing was when my friends and church found out I had a second surgery they will be bringing meals for another whole week!",

      "Content": "Apr 28, 2010 05:21PM - edited Apr 28, 2010 05:22PM by mtbookworm Does anyone know where to find a web site with good excercises. I wasn't given any when I left the hospital. Not sure what I should be doing at this point. My first surgery was April 14th and then had nodes removed from one side on the 22nd. One thing I had to say about the camisoles is they are excellent for while you have the drains in. I couldn't stand to go without anything and thought it felt good having the camisole hold \"everything\" in. Also they have pouches to keep the drains in. I meet with my surgeon tomorrow and hopefully will get my last drain out. A little nervous to see what they found in my lymph nodes, originally had Sentinal Node Biopsy and they found a less than half a mm spot in one node. I then meet with Oncologist on Friday. I think waiting for all the test to get back is the hardest thing. Also I had a chest x-ray and liver panel the day before my first surgery and then the morning of the surgery they left a message on my phone that there was a tiny area of abnomality on my chest x-ray and slightly elevated \"something\" on the liver panel, but they would follow up on it at my post surgery appointment.  Ok this scares me to dealth. Don't know why they had to tell me that the morning of my surgery. I'm trying to just face one thing at a time.",
