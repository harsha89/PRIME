In 2001 I had a lumpectomy on my rt breast.  I have been cancer free since then. Now I have cancer in my left. Many people I talked with felt I should take care of the cancer breast with immed. reconstruction.  I will get a breast reduction and breast lift on the right one...either immed. or at a later date.  Hopefully I can do everything at once.  Good luck to you with whatever you decide.",
