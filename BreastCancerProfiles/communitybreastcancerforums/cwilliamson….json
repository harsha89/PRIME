My Onc. and beautician say no manicure or pedicure until treatments are done.  They never said how long after - just after.   Would really like to have a pedicure! Daughter is moving from Iowa to South Carolina and will be getting here this morning to stay for a few days before heading on to SC.  Haven't seen them since Christmas.  Just hope the SE from treatment don't ruin the visit.   Hope you all had a good weekend!",

Saw the surgeon yesterday.  My cancer has to shrink before they can do surgery.  I see him again on August 24 after 4 rounds of A/C.  He will do an MRI to find out how much of the cancer is left.  I have pretty much decided to go ahead with a mastectomy on the right breast but am debating about the left.  Unless cancer shows up on the MRI in the left breast, it is clean.  Must decide if I want to have a mastectomy on both sides.  Have any of you had to face that decision?  Don't know the statistics on cancer occuring in the other breast once you have had one removed. As for ports, mine was put in when they did the biopsy.  It was a pain (literally) for a while but it sure makes the treatments a snap.  Did not feel a thing so I feel a little different about it now.  I am a hard stick so this makes it much more comfortable.   Been a rough couple of days as far as meltdowns go.  Not sure why it has hit me at this particular time but this shall pass, I am sure.   Hope everyone has a wonder holiday weekend.  We can do this!",

A week ago tomorrow since I had BM.  Things are going OK.  Just hate these darned drains.  Not much pain just uncomfortable from the drains.  DID I MENTION I HATE THESE DRAINS.  Start Taxol on Oct. 7.  Actually, ready to get started so it can be done.  DO NOT have to do radiation.  AC pretty much eradicated the cancer from what the surgeon says. For those that have surgery to come, it was much easier than I anticipated.  Good luck! My DD flies in this afternoon from North Carolina to stay for 2 weeks.  She was to get here yesterday but flights were canceled due to weather in Atlanta.  Hope she makes it today.  She is an awesome cook!!!  Taught her everything she knows except that I have forgotten how to use those skills.  Actually, don't know if I forgot or just don't care to use them!! Everyone take care!  I so enjoy reading your posts!!  You are a great bunch of folks!",

My blood was good again so no Nuelasta.  He said I must have some great bone marrow!   My prayers are with all of you struggling with this \"monster\"  We can get thru this! Still have fuzz, eyebrows and eyelashes.  What is with that?  Not complaining mind you but I thought all this stuff was going to go away.",

Some of you are really having awful SE.  I am so sorry.  I had my last AC last Wednesday and then went to see kids and grandkids in MO.  Think that was the best medicine I could have.  I miss them all so much.  Still questioning why we were brought to Arkansas just to get sick.  Oh well, maybe someday it will become apparent.   I feel like I am in a holding pattern right now.  I see my surgeon on Monday and have an MRI so I will probably have one mastectomy and possibly both.  They had to shrink my cancer before they could remove it.  After, there are 12 Taxol treatments so I probably won't finish until just before Christmas.  Many of you will be past this by then.  I really envy you, just want to get going and get this over.  I am anxious to see how all of you 12 Taxol girls do! Candy. . . when did they do the DIEP procedure on you? Seems there are decisions to make now.  Kind of overwhelming! Hang in there, girls and Tom!",

Concerned the Onc. will make me do another treatment since my last one was Sept. 12 and surgery isn't til the 16th.  Afraid it will be another AC.  That would about do it for me.  Has anyone ever heard of them doing 5 tx of AC?  The surgeon told me he wouldn't know about rads until after he got in there.  Still scheduled for 12 taxol after surgery.  He said there may be even more, depending on what he finds.   This is never going to be over.  Thought by Christmas I would be thru this but it doesn't look that way.  I feel as many of you have expressed - sick of it all and just want to be \"normal\" again.  ",

I am 62 and have diabetes, heart disease and other really fun stuff but I keep on keeping up.  Don't let things slow me down too much.  My blood has been really good.  Maybe that is why he gave me the choice.  I see the surgeon on the 24th so maybe I will talk to him.  He specializes in surgical oncology of the breast.  Wish this surgery was behind me.  Sound kind of grumpy today, don't I.  Missing my family in Missouri.",

Polly...glad you are doing well so far.  I know you don't want to get too confident just in case.  With this chemo stuff, you don't know what tomorrow is going to bring.  Hopefully, a big fat \"nothin\". Tom...my heart goes out to you both for your wife and your son.  We have 6 children and 12 grandchildren so I know how tough it is.  Can't tell you how many times my heart has been broken.  Will keep your family in my prayers.  Sometimes that is all we can do for our kids until they are ready to grow up.  Sometimes I think I want to give up being a Mom and try something that is more fun and doesn't hurt so much. Hang in there everyone and have a wonderful holiday weekend.  ",

Actually, don't think there a normal, as we knew it, after cancer.  We just have to find a \"new\" normal and that is not so easy.  We must think of ourselves and what we have been thru.  Most of us have not been in a habit of doing that but I certainly don't consider that being selfish - just smart!  There are just so many things in life we cannot change.  Finding happiness thru it all is difficult but you both deserve that.  Hang in there guys!! ",
