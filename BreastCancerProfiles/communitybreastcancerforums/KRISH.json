My mother has been diagnosed with IDC on April 4 , 2014. Even though i am a medico ( interventional cardiologist ) , i was very depressed and shattered by the news when it was conveyed to me on phone that mum has been diagnosed by FNAC and mammogram. I immediately  left my hospital and i cried in car on my way back home. I met oncosurgeon and planned for modified radical mastectomy with axillary lymphnode dissection. Now , the mastectomy is over and we are awaiting the results of ER/PR /HER 2 neu /Ki 67 analysis in biopsy specimen . Luckily the nodes are negative ( 0/15 ) and she will be starting chemo in May 2014. Being diagnosed with cancer shatters a person and relatives. However , soon we realise that there are so many who are battling the disease and have been cured. I did a lot of internet search on breast cancer than what i studied in my medical school , found this wonderful site and strong people like you .... it really helped me in overcoming my depression , fears , anger. You are absolutely right that we should spread awareness about the disease through social media like FB. Good luck to you.! ",
