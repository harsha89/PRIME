    "Content": "mavelard wrote: I am a 57 year old woman, mother died of breast cancer. Pain and swelling in my left breast, had diagnostic mammogram. Below are the findings: \"Tissue Density: Scattered Fibroglandular MAMMOGRAM In the left breast there is a low density focal asymmetry, measuri 5 to 6 mm. On tomosynthesis it appears to be at about 12o'clock in mid depth, having circumscribed mildly lobulated margins. ULTRASOUND: Targeted to the left breast at 12 o'clock axis, 1 to 2 cm from nipple, no focal lesion was identified. No cyst or solid mass or architectural distortion. ASSESSMENT: BI-RADS Category 3:Probably benign. FOLLOW-UP: Follow-up imaging evaluation in 6 months.\" I am very worried and concerned. They want to to wait 6 months for a repeat tomosynthesis mammogram. Do you think I should insist on a needle biopsy? I am on disability due to Chron's disease, and medicare does not cover second opinion. However, if needed I will seek out someone else to see, just not sure if it should be another radiologist to read the results, or a breast specialist. Log in to post a reply",
