I'm just finishing up treatment and signed on for the first time in a few months, and just reading your post made me feel not so crazy. I never understood how scary it can be AFTER it's all said and done. The negative thoughts creeping in, and feeling guilty for having them, or like they might manifest in some way. But, this is such a good place to voice our fears, and I think just putting them out there sort of helps let them go, if that makes sense. So, thanks for being open about the stuff you're going through, and I thank God for your healing :) Lots of love to you. Amy Adele",
