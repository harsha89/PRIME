It only lasted a couple days but I still went after the pain subsided because I tend to worry. She's didnt find any lumps and since the pain had gone away, I contributed it to being right around the time I was on my period. The other day when I was in the shower, I noticed a burning/weird sensation on the nipple of the same breast. I just took a shower and noticed my skin is peeling around my nipple but no other changes. Of course I googled and found pagets and am completely freaked out and panicked. I'm going to call my ob tomorrow to try to get an appointment. I'm scared: Log in to post a reply",
