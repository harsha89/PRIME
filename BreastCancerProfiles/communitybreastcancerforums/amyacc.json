I have been rooting for you and I am so happy to find you were b9  I literally cried for you.  Had my core biopsy today.  I was told at mammo  I had a 1 cm \"suspicious\" solid nodule.  I had to wait 10 ten days for the biopsy today.  My BS told me \"I am not perfect but I think it is benign\" and \"Don't lose sleep over this\"  I am holding onto this info to keep my sanity.  (He told me at my consultation he would be removing the entire mass.)  My BS told me he would call Wednesday with the results.  After reading this thread I am thinking I may take the day off of work.  I am a high school teacher and I am not sure I could finish the day if the results are bad.  However I am happy I will get a phone  call- don't think I could take the ride to the office. etc. Mom died 3 years ago this week from BC. (She did not test positive for BRCA) Maternal aunt four years ago. I only had this baseline mammo becuase I am 35, got married 3 weeks ago and we were planning to start a family.  I wanted to make sure i was cancer free first.  Now I can't help but think that if I have to go through chemo I will be hit with early menopause.    I feel like this phone call is not just about whether I have cancer and have to fight for my life but and more about whether I have to fight for my life and  lose my chances to have children with my husband.  Our honeymoon begins on March 31st and I am hoping for answers before it begins.   Thank you to everyone on this board who have shared their experiences.  Amy ",
