Watching the character's reaction was like hurtling me back to that point 20 years ago.  Of EVERYTHING I've been through, I think the point of first diagnosis was the absolute worst.  I could see myself in her face, her body language, her reaction - I think they captured it perfectly.

Fast forward these 19 years.  Last month, I was diagnosed with a DCIS and an 8 mm IDC in the SAME BREAST.  As we know, we can't re-radiate the same breast, so a mast. in the left breast is called for.  Since I am still only 53 and it appears that I have a tendency towards bc (even though I am BRCA negative), I have chosen to have a bilateral mastectomy.  I decided 1)  two breast cancers in one lifetime is enough   2) I will have a better chance at a matching set if we do both at the same time.  I've elected TEs with implants.  While I would have enjoyed the tummy tuck, I am looking for a shorter rather than a longer recovery time and avoiding messing with the rest of my body.  I am a large busted girl (but otherwise small) so I am looking forward to going smaller. Like all of us (it seems), I am scared to look at myself after surgery (which is on Friday). I'm not sure I'll ever feel totally comfortable that the bc won't come back (apparently it was highly unusual for me to develop a new primary after 19 years), but at least I won't be worrying about the right side in addition to the left. So we all have our reasons for choosing our own paths.  The most important is that YOU do the choosing.  It is a very empowering feeling. Joan",

Have any of you started to grow back your hair mid-treatment?  The last time I had chemo, I believe that my hair started to grow back somewhere around my last treatment.  This time I lost most, but not all of my hair and the hair that is remaining looks like it needs a haircut!  Since that hair is growing, I wonder whether the remaining hair will start to grow in sooner as well.  I am halfway through 6 sessions of T/C.",

I could have gone without my wig before then, but I'm very sensitive and didn't want to walk around with TOO short a haircut.  This time, though, I think I will ditch the wig earlier.  I just don't like the feel of the wig on my head, I care less about what people think (not that they're thinking anything bad) than I did when I was younger and it will probably be easier to go short than shoulder length.  I try not to think about my hair - just get through the day to day.

My hair is growing in - I am 10+ weeks PFC- and I am willing to bet that I will be going \"topless\" when my hair is at a much shorter stage than it was when I had cancer 19 years ago.  I guess that's the difference - at least for me  - between having cancer when you're 34 and having it when you're 54 - increased confidence.  :) Joan",

I thought I was out of the woods when I was diagnosed last month with both a DCIS and an IDC, on the same side as the bc 19 years ago.  Given that I had already undergone rads on that side I had no choice but a mastectomy.  The breast MRI showed NO cancer on the right, but I decided to have the right one removed prophylactically.  I am still only 53 years old and I feel that two breast cancers in one lifetime is enough.  I don't want to go through this again. That said, this was the right decision for ME.  I wish you the best in making the decision that is best for you. Joan",

What can you do in the meantime?  Join a support group.  I have attended and RUN support groups where the women absolutely glow - because they are in an environment where others truly understand.  The bonds they forge are unbreakable.  Find an activity that you enjoy - go to the theatre, start a jewelry making class, take up yoga.  Listen to music that makes your heart sing.  Get outside and talk a walk.  Relaxation exercises - mediation. And yes - meds.  I don't think an onc should be prescribing medication - it is a psychiatrist who specializes in this and should be helping you out. And now the kicker - after 19 years I was diagnosed with a new primary breast cancer (a very small one) for which I am in treatment.  And because I learned how to \"live\" after my first diagnosis, the second one has been easiER - not easy, but easier.  (I am reluctant to tell women that I've been rediagnosed, but it is a rare occurence and I like to think I've taken the bullet for all of you). What is that expression?  Depression is not a sign of weakness - it's a sign that you've been strong for too long.  Give yourself a break, sistah - and remember we are here for you!",

I was sleepy the first week, but am getting out now - to the mall, to lunch with friends, and am starting class tomorrow (I am in grad school).  There are a lot of great tips on this board.  Wear easy to pull up pants (sweats) home from the hospital, a front buttoning shirt (it will be hard to lift your arms over your head), USE your pain meds - they are your friends!  Let everyone \"do\" for you.  If you don't have people clamoring to cook meals for you, cook and freeze in advance.  The two most useful things my family/friends/community have done for me were to deliver meals and to gift me with money to have my house cleaned.  I don't particularly like to talk on the phone, so I kept everyone updated on FB.  Caringbridge.org is also a great site to keep everyone updated.   Just rest, rest, rest.  And take it day by day.  I don't know if you will need further treatment, but if you do, don't stress over rads or chemo now.  Just concentrate on your surgery - one step at a time. I know it may sound strange to some of the ladies on this board, but I didn't stress too much over losing my breasts - I looked at it as an opportunity.  I have always been much too big breasted for my 5' 2\" height.  Now, when I look at myself  post mastectomy (which wasn't THAT difficult, by the way), I have the beginnings of cute little perky breasts.  I am dreaming of all the strapless dresses and summer shirts I'll be able to wear in a few months. Most importantly, I am keeping you in my thoughts and prayers.  Feel free to emai me privately if you'd like.  Joan",

Best of luck with your surgery!",
