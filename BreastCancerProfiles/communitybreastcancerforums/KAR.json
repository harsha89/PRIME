Unfortunately they just don't know until they do the biopsy and a pathologist reviews the tissue.  I personally had a steriotactic core biopsy that confirmed mine but I didn't have a lump that you could feel either.  I have heard of some ladies on this board who have had excisional biopsy/lumpectomy so I don't think its abnormal.   I bet since your Mother had it at such a young age they are taking it seriously, which in my opinion they should (I'm no Doctor though)  Wishing your lump is a B9 fibroadenoma.  Lot of luck  ",

Good luck",
