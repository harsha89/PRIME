I cannot explain the pain. Prior to starting my chemo, I started juicing, The juices that I help build my immune system since the chemo is tearing it down. I also have tissue expanders. I had read that 100c hurts so I asked y doctor to only fill with 60 cc.  I get my fill every 2 weeks. So far I have had 2. I get my 3rd one on Friday.  You may want to take a pain pill prior to getting the fill.   ",
