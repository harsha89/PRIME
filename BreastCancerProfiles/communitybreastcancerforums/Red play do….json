I was sent for a Breast MRI after a tumor was found in my right breast.My lymph nodes \"lit up\" as the doctor said. He also said it wasn't unusual, that many factors could make them light up besides just cancer. My oncologist ordered a lymph node biopsy because they lit up on the MRI and they were larger than normal. I had the biopsy and they came back normal showing no cancer cells. So even when it looks bad, it sometimes isn't.",
