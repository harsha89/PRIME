(1st time was in 2002).  Since we with TNBC can't take any of the hormonal drugs, chemo is very important for us.  I was given a regimen of 4 AC and 4 Taxol, dose dense.  This was preceded by a bi-lateral mastectomy in March.  I was told I'd be out for 6 weeks following that, but I went back to work half days after 4 weeks.  I went back full-time after 6 weeks, and this schedule was very workable for me.  I started chemo 6 weeks after my mastectomies. I work for a small financial services company (staff of 10) and everyone was very supportive.  We have to dress professionally but it was summer so I could dress slightly less formally than during the winter months.  I had to wear a wig too (hats or scarves would not have been acceptable).  I'd get your wig before your 2nd chemo treatment as that's when the hair starts to fall out.  I had my head shaved right at the point it started to fall out.  It's now 6 months after my mastectomies and 6 weeks after the end of chemo and I'm still wearing my wig and will be for several more months.  So get something you like and is comfortable as you'll be wearing for awhile. I had my chemo treatments on Thurs. and so took off Thurs. and Fridays after the first couple of treatments (early on I took only the Thurs. off).  I worked throughout my chemo but left at 3 p.m. each day without taking a lunch hour, giving my a 6-hour workday.  This worked well for me.  And even though I had a terrible time with SE's (constant nausea despite all the new meds, several hospitalizations because of zero white blood count, skin rashes, allergies to Taxol, neuropathy, terrible fatigue, etc.), I continued to work throughout.  It kept my sane and gave me something to think about besides the stupid cancer.  It also helped me to feel a bit more like myself.  I might not have been at my peak work-wise, but I could certainly do my job.  But clearly It would not have been possible to work if I had to travel for my job or be an air traffic controller or something like that.  I really depends on the nature of your job. The fatigue was probably the worst of it and I had friends do some of my grocery shopping for me.  I also asked a couple of my friends who like to cook make me a bunch of meals I could freeze and reheat.  Living in New York City, I also took car service and taxis to and from work every day as the subways were too much for me physically.  It was a splurge financially but well worth it.  Besides I wasn't spending money on anything else (except for medical care of course).  I used whatever energy I had doing my cancer treatments and going to work....there really wasn't any energy left for anything else.  It was possible because of my situation too -- I'm single.  With personal support and a supportive workplace, I think working throughout chemo is definitely doable....and even preferable.  But that's just my opinion.  You'll do whatever you decide is best for you.  Best of luck to you!  Ellen",
