I had my first mamogram a little over a week ago - I was called back for a compression mamogram due to a grouping of calcifications. Today my doctor called and told me I need a biopsy. I will have the biostatic? biopsy in May. So I expect for this area to be benign and I appreciate the radiologist and doctor being careful. I know that 80% of calcifications are benign and that they are common. But even though I know all this, I think I am feeling something else - although I am not sure what - just know I feel anxious. This is a strange thing to share and ask about but I would appreciate hearing anyone elses experiences. I have noticed for many months - maybe even a year - that my left breast would have the typical pms symtoms of being sore and full before my period. However my right one - the one the biopsy will be on - no longer would get sore or full at all. It has been like it was not \"working\" anymore  - if that makes sense. I thought it was strange for it to be that way month after month - only sore on one side but I did not think it meant anything. Has anyone else had this experience? Now that I am supposed to have a biopsy, I cant help but wonder if it is connected. Thank you   Log in to post a reply",

I feel silly for letting any of this get to me but if I am honest it has. I actually called and asked the the surgeon's nurse who I see tommorow if they could see me sooner than my appt date which was a week and a half away. They changed it to Thursday and then called me back an hour later with a cancellation so they can see me in the morning. I was very grateful. Hopefully, I will have the biopsy done at the same time. She said they usually try to do that but they need to see what kind i need. The radiologist suggested stereotactic. According to the radiology report I have numerous clustered plemorphic calcifications in the inner lower region of my right breast. I am a birad 4. Are any other type of other biopsies done for calcifications?  I know the stats and I know that it will likely be benign - that is what I am expecting. Maybe it is becuase my daughter was just diagnosed with epilepsy and is having numerous doctor's appts, including upcoming surgery. And then add on a whole lot of other things going on in my life and well, this is just about  put me other the top. Maybe I just needed to say this all somewhere. I also needed to know, fo those of you who have had a stereotactic, if I have the procedure in the morning will I be able to go somewhere that afternoon without being too uncomfortable? I appreciate your help - thank you. Log in to post a reply",
