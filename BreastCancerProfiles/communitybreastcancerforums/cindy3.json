But Medicare does not pay for any alternative treatments, which are extremely expensive. What a crazy system we have. And life is so trying. It's good to read other inspiring stories to keep one's hopes up. Cindy",

First of all, I decided to go to a spiritual center. The one here is  vibrant with singing, motivational speaking, and a mind/body spiritual connection that filled my soul. I went in with a headache and frown, and came out with no headache and a smile. I felt I was home and did not feel alone. What a great piece of the puzzle to find again! It was the best gift I could give to myself. I am getting a few house and animal sitting jobs. I'm putting it out there, as word of mouth is works best for this. I'm still going from house to house, and am on the bus. However, since March I have been able to use my friend's car one day a week to go to Boulder to see my Chinese doctor who gives me acupuncture and herbs. I have been doing these herbs for seventeen years, two times a day, three days a week. I came to Denver because she said she could help me avoid  surgery for the diverticulitis.....and she has! It has taken almost six months, once a week visits, but my pain and infection is gone! My blood counts are back to normal and the oncologist has taken me off of the Zometa, and am only on the Femara at this point. She has been my saviour, the one for me. I met her in 1996, when a friend said her white blood counts did not drop during chemo while she was doing these herbs. I said sign me up! And I have been doing them ever since. I attribute my wellness to her, although the oncologist wants to take all the credit. My insurance does not cover any of these treatments. This is my biggest expense. How do you choose between housing and health? It is where all of my SSDI goes. However I did find a local organization: www.emeraldheart.org The Emerald Heart Cancer Foundation  provides resources to women with cancer who use integrative/holistic treatments. Dr. Bernie Siegel is a medical adviser. Cindy Dx 4/9/1995, DCIS, Stage IV, 3/3 nodes, ER+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
