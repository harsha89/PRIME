The bone pain was excruciating from head to knees. Hurt to touch any part of my body so laying down was a problem. Tylenol did not make a dent in the pain. Lasted for about 48 hours and now I'm just tired with chemo muscle fatigue. Not sure what the next shot will bring on and whether this is cumulative too. Anyone else experience this?",

There are clinical studies and trials with specific requirements for eligibility ( lumpectomy, clear margins, negative nodes etc). I will find out if I qualify. Is anyone considering this?",

Had out of state boss, bosses boss, and senior executive visit my regional site last week. All men who are supportive, but don't want to know too much.

It gets tender when I over exert. The issue with the bruising is a side effect of chemo and blood count which requires contacting your Onc. Don't ignore it! Luvbugs - Your love bugs are adorable! Wish I could expand the pic! Love Italian food too! Milky Way/ sick of pink - my 3rd treatment has been the worst so far with body aches and fatigue. I am 2 weeks in and the symptoms have not improved. No steady recovery until the next shot - scheduled for 1/4. This round has not given me any nausea at all. The pre-chemo cocktail seems to be enough to keep it at bay. Eating like a horse and adding poundage! The nulasta shot on the other hand kicked my butt and left me in great pain for 48 hours. That shot seems to have a cumulative effect on the body too. Went from no issues with shot 1, to neck and shoulder pain shot 2, to full body pain shot 3. Figure I'll be hospitalized with shot 4. Hope all you ladies have a fantastic Christmas!! Virtual hugs to all!",

It's brutal to climb steps. The longer I sit or remain inactive, the worse it is. I have this into the next treatment, so it doesn't subside in week 2 or 3, like other SEs. I read its a SE of Taxotere that doesn't get much press. Always something. I also woke up this morning with pain in middle finger joint. Is this the beginning of neuropathy?

There are many different methods and approaches to improving health and diet which are all designed to reduce risk of recurrence. I have just finished my 4th and final round of T&C, which I consider to be chemo Lite. I think it's the least toxic and shortage duration of the cocktails. Each round of chemo increases the liklihood of serious side effects which impact quality of life. i firmly believe that surgery removed my cancer and the chemo was just added insurance. I agreed to the chemo only because i was diagnosed as TN. I believe I've been blessed with minimal side effects because I was healthy going into this phase, had a strong support system, and a positive attitude. My only side effect is fatigue which my Onc said will subside in a couple months. The advantage i had was a lumpectomy, cold caps to keep my hair, and no port installed. As a result, i am treated normally by all. I was able to work full time throughout this phase and even go on a business trip. I do not take any vitamins/supplements/prescribed drugs or support any special diets or exercise programs. I intend to move onto rads and not look back. I have a great family, career, and many dreams to fulfill. I view this as a blip on the radar and intend to be happy and healthy in the new year. I hope all you gals find peace and happiness.
