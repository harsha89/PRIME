My focus is getting rid of cancer. I did not want the extra recovery time, or risk of infection or other health problems. I wear the prosthesis for work or exercise, I do find that it helps me feel more balanced (UMX) but with a BMX I might not use them at all. It's nice to have choices, it's an accessory. Good luck and take care!",
