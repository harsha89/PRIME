They did a core needle biopsy and results came back as suggestive of a mammory hematoma with patchy activiry in cd 10, cd 45 and vimentim. Breast surgeon had pathologist look at it again as I told her I was concerned and worried. She said he checked it all again and nothing atypical or concerning showed up. But after further reviee he favored taking it out. She said its.safe to wait till after the holidays but im a hot mess right now. What does cd 10, 45 mean? Her and the pathologist dont seem concerned and my husband said becauee i keep pushing thats why they favored taking it out. Log in to post a reply",
