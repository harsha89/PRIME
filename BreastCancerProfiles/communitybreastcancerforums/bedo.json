Nature really made me feel better and I didn't think about cancer for hours.  I will be thinking of you today and please let us now your results. PS, when you just need a distraction the game section is fun.  I farm at farmville has gone to seed. PS, I was convinced it had spread to my leg..  Was shin splints.",

I could. for my daughter I was told there would be a 7%-10% chance of  DISTANT mets in 10 years. with hormone suppression. I asked what if that happens? He said, we'll deal with it and you'll get more years.  You have to take into account your menopausal status.  Ask him for hard facts, yours may not be the same as mine re receptors, age, but the numbers helped me understand.  Also, some people are more comfortable with 7% others want it lower (I don't know if this would be lower if I had had a mastectomy) Grade 1 is Whoopee!  What a wimp of a cancer!  Not to down play it. Go with your gut if you will always be second guessing yourself go more agressive.  Discuss it with your family and you don't have to make a decision tomorrow.  There may be options for having family members drive you?  I was \"fortunate\" enough to be laid off with my whole department the week before the news so I had all the time in the world to think about it until my insurance runs out then I will do something.  So there are many 'good things'  support of farmily, trust in your surgeon, grade1 options, size 2 (cm) mine was actually 1.6 after surgery.  The surgeon made an incision very side of my breast about an inch and one around the nipple that will fade so that it won't show.  She said I could still wear low cut tops.  (As if I care, no one but senile old men what to look at these babies)  So good luck there. and keep us posted.  There are protocols out there for different types of breast cancer regarding size etc,  you could look up Mayo's or ACC or yours.  Someone help me out here!  I can't find it.  ! You could check with dlb823 she is very knowlegable  as are a lot of people. She also explained why they only took 2 nodes instead of a whole bunch, it's the new thinking. I'm sure she wouldn't mind if you pm'd her. So yippee, less chance of lymphadema",

I have been vegetarian since age 16, a loooong time ago.  I am to eat 70-80- gms of protein a day during radiation?! The thought of eating well, animals makes  me sick. Sorry guys, the rest of the family eats meat and I totally understand.  I have lost 12 pounds in about 2 months and the thought of anything but hard boiled eggs, ice cream and ginger ale makes me sick. Maybe from the AI?  Who knows, maybe stress.  How can I get that much protien? I can't cak down the \"Boost\" that my daugher bought me even holding my nose. Peanut butter is Ok, I guess. Any other protein drinks that are not icky?  Thanks for your advice!",

You could ask for a paracervical block (numbing the cervix with lidocaine) but it is very unlikely that you would need it.and that would only be if there were difficulty. Very unlikely. Chances are, you'll be fine.  As far as having it out after chemotherapy, your provider might want to wait until your counts come up so that \"disturbing things\" doesn't cause an infection.  Mine fell out and I didn't know it!  Im not sure why he would check your hormones if you are post-menopausal.  Good luck fredntan!

Most important was fatigue from radiation and healing.  Also important was the  fact that I couldn't concentrate and felt my IQ had dropped 20 points.  Also, I was very emotional.  Going back into my profession would have hurt my reputation and possibly hurt others.  I am looking for a job now (I was diagnosed 2 weeks before our office closed 5 1/2 monhts ago) but still slept 12 hours last night. My mind is clear again but I anticipate mainly sleeping on my off hours and would prefer a 32 hour a week job. RI has 24 week short term disability. There were other issues going on with me, but there are 6 states that have it for people who live and work in them, if anyone needs to look into it.   So hang in there ladies,  things will get better. It's good to get out.  Treat yourself.  Summer will return. ",

It was BC. This may be a little dumb, but I was thinking, oh, it's just like that fibroadenoma you had taken out when you were 20.  I had a mini anxiety attack, which I never have. But maybe it is similair in prognosis since everything looks good?  I don't even know what I'm asking.  Has anyone else felt like this?

I'm sure that your friend meant well, but I would probably have had a snarky remark like \" it IS really hard to understand statistics and breast cancer is so complex and individualized that that I think I will rely on my MO's opinion about this.but thank you for your concern and your friendship.\".",

So the equation would be (risk of recurrence X 0.34) +(risk of recurrence).  There are 2 types of recurrence, distant and local but most docs seems to focus mainly on the distant.,  Also, the study for original cancers seems to show increasing alcohol effects the risk of Est + BC.more than other types. .That's my best answer, so I guess the best is less is better, but it's a personal choice. SpecialK Did they mention at the conference whether this included both kinds of recurrence? Thanks!",
