For the 6 months prior to diagnosis, I actually felt more tired and sleeping more than I usually do, which is different from my old self. i just finished chemo 4 weeks ago and I can say that I feel better now that I did just prior to diagnosis. That's not say that I'm not out of shape after chemo, but my energy level is coming back. In fact, every week out of chemo I feel stronger and stronger. Leslie",
