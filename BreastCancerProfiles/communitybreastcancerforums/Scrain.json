I did wish this past year away and I have 3 teenagers and hate to see the time fly by but was so ready to just get it behind me. It went by really fast too. I had the red chemotherapy first. It was the worst part. I ended with taxol. I never got sick one time. The meds they have now are amazing. I was tired but never to sick. I remember the time when you don't know anything is the worst. It so much better when they get a plan for you and a goal. Best wishes to both of you. I gained some weight with chemotherapy and trying hard to loose more. I am watching what I'm eating. No alcohol, very little meat.. Fish. I drink green tea, broccoli and soy milk which all have antioxidants and are supposed to be helpful. Also exercising almost daily. I agree it's very important to be healthy. It's a change and a new lifestyle for sure. I just wanted to visit with others that are dealing with the same type of situation and I appreciate it. We have the advantage of being able to take tamoxifen. go away cancer!!! We are stronger than you!!",
