Its always your choice a very difficult one.  I have to say I dont regret it ! My surgery was Jan 31st expanders were placed at the same time as the mastectomy, it takes time I'm adjusting but healing though I developed a blood clot inmy leg which has slowed me down.  Good luck with your decision I'll keep you in my thoughts and prayers. (I have a 16 yo and 14yo that too helped me with my decision) Laurie",
