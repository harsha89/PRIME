I wasn't aware that hre2+ has an increased risk of brain mets. The one person I know well with advanced breast cancer, her brain was her first metastisis and she is triple negative. She (and a very stupid doctor who did not take BC into account when treating a headache that wouldn't go away and lasted for months) waited quite a long time to get treatment even with some pretty severe symptoms. She has a significant amount of lasting brain damage from the whole expereince. As for the women who chose not to know, I can understand where they are coming from and sympathize with them, I was almost one of them.

A quick review: I found my lump on Valentine's day, diagnosed back in February, had a major lumpectomy with 1st level node dissection. This led to lymphedema. Had a routine basline scan prior to starting chemo that showed suspicious places in liver that turned out to be mets. Initial diagnosis of stage 4 at 26 years old. One was treated with radiofrequency ablation, the other was inoperable due to being located near a major vein.  I had 4 treatemtents of TCH, the last was about 2 weeks ago. The results from my mugga scan were that the Herceptin is affecting my heart and I need another scan in a few weeks to see how quickly I bounce back before they decide if I can have herceptin again. I also had a brain MRI a few days ago due to some dizzy spells I've been having lately, getting results on Monday. Hoping that it's just due to changing psych meds in preperation for starting tamoxifen. I'm really scared about the CT scan I'm going to have this week. I'm ready to start living my life again, and I feel like everything has been on hold while I've been waiting for chemo to be over. I've already discussed it with my Onc, no matter what the results, she wants me to try Tamoxifen next. I'm really looking forward to that. I've been on lupron already, so even if the menopausal symptoms get worse, I'm not anticipating it to be bad at all compared to chemo. I'm even more scared of the *next* 3 month scan. If the cancer has grown or spread at that point will I have to go back on chemo? Shortly after I was diagnosed, long before we knew I was stage 4, my boyfriend of 6 & 1/2 years (FINALLY)  proposed. I told him we would schedule it for when my hair grows back. Well now that chemo is over, I'm ready to start planning. My social worker told me I could have a pixie cut as soon as October. So I don't want to wait anymore. I want to live. And I want to get married. But what if I start planning and then I find out I need chemo again? I don't want to be a bald bride. (And I will NOT wear a wig on my wedding day. I have a very nice wig that I wear to work. Wigs have their place, but not for me, on my wedding day.) I've been thinking about next May. I want enough time to plan, but now I'm thinking again. I don't know what to do. I'm just taking one day at a time, but how do I plan a wedding taking one day at a time?

Thank you also for the tip about the social worker/nurse practitioner. I have been working extensively with both at my cancer center. I don't know how I would get through this without them. They have been wonderful! I was very worried about my fertility at first, now I'm not so sure. I guess I still want to protect it, just in case I do decide to have children. I've always been so adamant about wanting kids. But the thought of leaving them without a mother is unbearable. But it is still not something I am ready to close the door on completely. The thought of being at stage IV makes me feel much less secure in my mortality. When I thought I was stage II, I could concentrate on moving past all of this as quickly as possible. Now that I might be stage IV, looking at cancer as a chronic condition is new to me. I'm so used to thinking of cancer as something that you either cure or it kills you. I'm glad that there is another option now, but it is difficult to wrap my head around.  I've decided not to go through with the second needle biopsy tomorrow morning. Now that I know it is possible to do the procedure entirely laproscopically, I want to be knocked out!!! The recovery time won't be that much worse and I'm pretty much guaranteed a definitive answer. I don't see a reason NOT to go straight to the laproscopic surgery. The only reason I didn't make this decision on friday was that I wasn't thinking clearly enough.",

Apparantly how a liver biopsy goes is entirely dependent on where in the liver they need to biopsy. The suspicious places on my scan happened to be in the most difficult to reach spot on the whole liver. Joy. They barely sedated me at all because I had to breathe deeper than I thought possible and hold my breath for as long as possible. (They could only reach the spot when my lungs were fully expanded with air, pushing my liver out from under my ribcage.) The doc & techs & nurses all said I was the best at holding my breath that they had ever seen & that is the only reason they were able to successfully reach it at all. It was also much more painful than the breast biopsy. They told me there is a inner skin over the liver which cannot be numbed, so even though the local has thoroughly numbed the surface of your skin, the needle is still painful. Imagine having to hold perfectly still and hold your breath while being kicked in the stomach. And if you don't do it right they have to try again! In some ways the waiting is easier than with the breast biopsy. I already know I have cancer. I already had a total emotional breakdown, sobbing & shaking for 2 hrs in the oncologist's office. I have much more support in place (breastcancer.org for one!) I'm mostly numb right now.",

My oncologist also set me up with a liver surgeon who I'm having a consultation with tomorrow afternoon. I also meet my radiologic oncologist tomorrow, so a pretty busy day.  I did not like my oncologist's attitude when I told her that I was seeing a gastrointerologist. She said something like \"I don't know why you are bothering with that, they won't be able to do anything for you anyway, but if it makes you feel better, go right ahead, I have no objection\" She also had a less than stellar attitude when I asked her about getting a second opinion (\"it's really only necessary if you doubt your team\")  The oncologist is also not great at getting me test results back in a prompt manner. It doesn't help that my entire household has exploded with health problems recently. Besides what is going on with me, my boyfriend has a very bad case of poision ivy, some possible chemical burns in a tender area due to his attempts to treat this (makes for a VERY cranky boyfriend!)

Anyway, I'll post again when I know more, possibly tomorrow night if I'm up to it. For now it's a nice soak in the bath & then SLEEP! *big hugs* to everyone who has posted here! It's a very good feeling to know you care!",

If they still don't know then they have to do a surgical biopsy. I'm left wondering how important is it to know for sure? We seem to be going to a lot of trouble to figure this out. We already know I have cancer, what else can we do about it? Will it change anything? These are questions for my Onc the next time I see her & before I schedule any other procedures.  Oy Vey.",

Hopefully the answer will be in by tomorrow though, so that is very exciting. Even better is the second opinion liver surgeon who can diagnose me without surgery!!! He has a very strong background in liver tumors of all kinds and he is pretty confidant that it is *not* metastatic breast cancer. I have heard simmilar before. (About the initial breast lump). But I trust his experience and I don't think he is just saying it to make me feel better. He says that if it is the type of non cancerous tumor that he thinks it is, then a simple MRI will be diagnostic to prove it with 99% certainty. YAY! No more painful procedures!  I was just starting to gear up and get started fighting this thing. I was even seriously considering cold cap treatment to try to keep my hair. I guess I was just looking for ways to make this whole thing a little more bearable. And then out of left field I get hit with this sucker punch. Suddenly I'm more concerned about whether I'm going to live or die than I am about my hair. I guess it put things in perspective for me. Hopefully I can come out of this liver scare (and I hope it is just a scare) with a lesson. I was feeling pretty sorry for myself about having node positive stage two cancer, until I *truly* understood how much worse it could be. While I'm still not sure if I believe that there is a higher power that can or would be sending me this message, I can still take it as a lesson anyway. Hopefully I will have the MRI results by tomorrow. After seeing the second opinion surgeon, I am really truly hopeful that these liver masses will turn out to be benign. I will post again when I know for sure.   A big thank you to all you wonderful ladies that have given me so much support over the past couple of weeks. It feels like more, it feels like forever.",

I had the whole variety of breast scans. Ultrasound & Mammo. Then biopsy. Then Breast MRI & genetic marker test. Then the surgery. Then decided on which chemo I needed & was planning the port insertion surgery when I had the Mugga scan and the CT. Postponing chemo because of an infection due to some infection from my surgery. (see \"my drain is a pain\" for more about that!) Darlinedenise: I do have an anti-anxiety perscription. I didn't have it at the dr's office so they had to find one for me. They said they were going to do one through IV if they couldnt find a pill! Thanks for sharing your story with me. Are the tumor markers part of your bloodwork? As far as I know, all my bloodwork had come back clean. Everyone, thank you for responding. I'm more scared than I have ever been about anything ever. And I feel like I can't talk to anyone about it because I don't want my close friends and family to be scared too. My mom knows I'm hiding something from her and I feel bad about that. I know she'll understand. My boyfriend does know, he was there with me at the dr office.  I will update here when I have the news, sometime later this week. I'm supposed to know by friday at the latest. I have no idea how I will deal until then.",

It looks like it probably IS metastatic breast cancer. 2nd opinion liver surgeon was ready to leave it at that, but my oncologist demands tissue proof before we call it for sure. Second needle biopsy on Monday. 2nd opinion liver surgeon will also get the actual images on Monday. If the second needle biopsy is also inconclusive, then I will have 2nd liver surgeon do laproscopic surgery. First liver surgeon would have done \"hand assisted laproscopic surgery\" more invasive, more scarring and more recovery time. I am so sick of this roller coaster. ",

Deciding not to have that next needle biopsy was a HUGE step in asserting my rights as a patient and making a powerful treatment decision for myself. I feel just one tiny bit less like I am on a runaway rollercoaster. I guess I haven't made such an important decision for myself since picking which breast surgery I would have. Having these spots in my liver has taken so much time. I can see the light at the end of the tunnel now. I just can't tell if it is sunshine or an oncoming train. But either way I can see the end of this uncertainty. I will know on Thursday. Either way, my wait will be over. Anyway, I need to get some rest, I'm going to work tomorrow!",

Sea bands work from pressure points on the wrist. I have horrible motion sickness, and discovered these were helpful for that. (I was quite skeptical at first but tried them when I was desperate and was shocked by how well they worked.) Now I'm using them for chemo. No chemicals, no side effects. Anyone at risk from or experienceing lymphedema (like me) should be careful about using them on the affected wrist. When I was using them for motion sickness, I found that they only worked when they were on both wrists correctly (the little white bead needs to be in a very specific spot, but the included directions make that relatively easy). Now I find they work if I put it on just my non-lymphedema arm. I have some swelling in my surgical wrist so I don't know if that is putting pressure on the same spot in a different way. My guess is that someone with no swelling but a risk for future swelling needs to use them on both wrists. As always, ask your doc. But if someone is looking for a natural remedy for nausea, which can be layered over all your other nausea meds this is a very good thing to try. I hope it helps some of you as much as it helped me!  I find it works within 5 min, but when you take it off, it stops working within 5 min as well.
