Once my body heats up, the stinging starts and I have to stop, which means I can't exercise for very long. My favorite form of exercising is tap dancing or line dancing. I tried line dancing a few months ago, the room was very air conditioned and I was under the vent, but I had to quit, it was too painful. I'm beginning to think my only hope is that this is temporary. hugs",

It's a great chance to meet each other in person and spend a whole week together! I am also looking for someone to share a room with (so this is why I'm posting here. lol), and promise I am a very nice person. hugs, Juli",
