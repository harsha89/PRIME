Had several scopes done and in Jan of 2012 went to a DR in Aurora Co Medical center.While there an endoscopic ultrasound was done. An 18x17mm mass was found near the pota heptus that was necrotic and was likely mets of BC to liver. In the normal shuffle of papers and drs visits because of progressing pain the fact of having a mass in my liver was// has been ignored... That is until now 4weeks ago developed a pulling type pain in my  right groin area. That got worse so  2 weeks ago was sent for a CT of the pelvis.. Well it now shows I have a 1.6cm lymph node in my groin area that continues to be painful not so much from the node it self but pressing on nerves in that area....I called my ONC and would like to press for a bioposy of the node ... or something. If you were in my shoes what would you do...any ideas?? Dx 6/24/2008, DCIS, 2cm, 2/13 nodes, ER+/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",
