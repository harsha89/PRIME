This, I was not prepared for.  I trust my sisters here to not discriminate between a higher-staged cancer with all the awful things about that, and my own concerns with a lower-staged BC. That's what's great about this place.  I still have to always worry about BC in any future screenings, which is hard enough (scares me to death), but right now, this is the thing.  My skin held up well, but after the peeling, I have almost no aurela on the treated side.  The fact that the one side is smaller would not be so noticeable, except for the fact that I have one normal aurela, and on the other side just a bright-pink nipple, and NO aurela around.  This is (not what I expected) the thing that is making the treated breast look so different.  I know you can't really know how you'll look till later, but I'm pretty much thinking that the no aurela pigment isn't going to come back. I will do the minor teatment of a tiny aurela tattoo if I have to, but, really, so weird (and if HMO does not pay for that as reconstruction, cannot afford it).  I put a pinky-brown lipstick to show an aurela on the treated side, and it made the whole thing look normal; could not really notice that it was smaller.  Just want to look/feel as normal as I can, as I just want to, and also, very much, do not want to be reminded.  Thank you. xx",
