I would check VERY carefully if you had one affected node - I'm no expert, but if it's started to travel around I would want to do everything possible to stop it in its tracks. This is the conventional wisdom these days... it might change when treatments change. I do know that one doctor, somewhere, decided to do a study with excision only for  DCIS; the study had to be halted because so many participants were showing recurrence of the disease. Just my opinion, but I am almost looking forward to radiation (mind you I haven't had my lumpectomy yet). I may not be able to take tamoxifen because of some other health issues, so I certainly am going to do whatever I can to make sure this does not come back.  Check the DCIS forum for more info and opinions on radiation. And you can also do what I do when I have a medical issue: get as many second opinions as I want, and take a consensus. So far I've had four doctors tell me lumpectomy + radiation, so I figure that's probably what I'm going to do.  Best wishes! ",

The one thing I can say is, no one can make this decision for anyone else. Everyone is different. Probably the only thing we all have in common is that it's a tough decision, deciding what will be right for us. And the other thing that is universally helpful is an understanding and supportive DH (or whatever partner). Sounds like you have that in spades, and I am very happy for you.  I went back and forth on fat grafting and DIEP, finally went with DIEP, not entirely convinced it was the bestest thing ever. You will be \"missing out\" on hours and hours of anethesia time and exhausting recovery! I wish you best best wishes in making your decision. I have a good feeling you'll make the right one for you.",

We're all going through enough here without thinking that we somehow caused it by reacting poorly to rough situations. Seriously, I've lived through enough stress to kill someone by now -- starting with an infertility battle, a premature baby who was hospitalized for a year, who now has autism, and on and on and on... I think my diagnosis would be so much more severe if stress were a real factor, but it's stage 0 DCIS. What I try to do is reduce stress (because it makes life easier and better) and eat well and get enough sleep. The study above sounds kind of flawed to me. I mean, who HASN'T experienced stressful events if you go back a few years? The death of a parent... the loss of a job... moving... life IS stress! Yet not everyone gets cancer. That said, I do believe that autoimmune diseases are linked to stress. Study after study has in fact shown a higher incidence of these among parents of disabled children. Just sayin'. I have not heard of higher incidences of cancer among parents of disabled kids.   OK, off my soapbox.  ",

One of the surgeons I spoke to was very reassuring, say they are much better at avoiding heart & lung these days but it's still very good to hear from people who have gone through radiation (and who smoked). Congratulations on quitting! (Have to admit, I've been having 1-2 a week, because it's a stressful time  but I really do think/know I can quit for good before I begin the treatment.)",

She was hugely overweight all her life. She had a heart attack (and heart problems previously). She never had diabetes. She did not have any cancer. Really... part of it is is heredity. Part of it might be environmental? But part of it is just seeing things we never saw before. I love bloody marys! I think I'll have one this weekend and raise my glass to you.  Best wishes! ",

My experience was that a radiologist said he THOUGHT it might be a very early cancer (he didn't say DCIS but I googled and found out). Then I had the biopsy and when the pathology report came it that's what it was. So he was very suspicious about what he saw. But sometimes it turns out to be nothing, which I'm certainly hoping is the case with you.  Best wishes! ",
