My Onc put it a great way - he is in the job of living.  There is an \"end\" for all of us - that is a given and this doesnt make it anymore defined.  It is just another challenge that faces you every day.  So maybe put a regime of tests in place to assist in detecting - and each year that you clear that - celebreate your life! Cheers Debs PS - I am starting chemo on Mon 11th, scared yet OK with the fact that this is what kills it!",

My 9 year old was complaining of a sore `boob` a few months ago.  I have been consumed with my new dx - now that I am reading this I am going to check her out tomorrow and maybe get her to see a doc if it is still `sore` for her.  I read in some book that some girls do experience lumps as their boobs grow.  I am rather large chested and developed very early - so I guessed this might be the case for my girls - but now this has me very stressed.  They are asleep right now - but will ask her first thing as to how she feels in the morning. You have made me more aware for my children - so bless you for coming here.  D",

SHould I just stop taking the pill anyway - I wont be \"doing it\" for quite some time seeing lumpectomy was just 2 weeks ago - the girl is very sore and bruised.",

I have had a lumpectomy, waiting to me an onc to discuss options.  Only 41 and am considering taking both if it means reducing the risk fo rme!  Good luck and hope it stays as non-invasive.  Keeping smiling, Deb",
