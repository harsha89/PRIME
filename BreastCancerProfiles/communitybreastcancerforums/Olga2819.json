All was arranged by a very very empathic and profesional company named Mediconsult OG (www.mediconsult.co.at). They arranged all treatments, escorted me from arrival in Innsbruck and at all pre operation examinations (MRI of the brest, a new biopsy an so on) and where with me while all talkes to the doctores before and after the surgery, translatins everything for me to russian! and since they are doctors, I believe that the translation was even more profesional than if it was done only by a \"normal\" translator.  Now i am after the operation and want to thank you for this internett site. If someone wants to be treated in Austria, I definitly recomand the university clinic of Insbruck and this great help from the company Mediconsult OG Thank you, thank you, thank you Olga",
