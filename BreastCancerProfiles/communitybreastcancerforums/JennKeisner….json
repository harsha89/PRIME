You can always have the mastectomy if you choose (I had it after my chemo was over because I had found out during my chemo that I tested positive for BRCA 1. Dont' be embarrassed to ask any questions to your doctors. If they make you feel like you are bothering them, find another doctor. You want someone who you feel comfortable with. My oncologist even gave me his email address and cell phone number if I need him. It is a long road but looking back, it went really fast. I found my lump 9/30/05 and I can't believe that it is almost 2 years ago. That time really flew. My hair is better then it was before and life is great! It will be fore you to. Just stay positive and never second guess yourself. Follow your gut. Good luck.",

I had a lumpectomy on 10/27/05. 2 wks later I found that the sentinal node had minimal clusters of cancer so they had to go back in to remove them all on 11/27/05. I didn't want to be going through chemo during the holidays so I held off. I was supposed to start on 1/5/06, however, I wound up switching oncologists in the interum and my new one was on vacation that week. I had scheduled things (daughter's bday party etc) for my off weeks and needed to stay on that cycle so I didn't actually start chemo until 1/20/06. I am sure it will be fine. I don't think my onc would have allowed me to wait that long if they thought it would have been a problem.",
