(DX 4/29/11, 3 u/s, 2 biopsies, 1 MRI, bone scan, CT scan, 2 panic attacks w/ 1 trip to ER, 1 EKG, 4 separate major blood draws, BMX w/ TE's 6/14/11 in less than 2 months!!!) up next is chemo and possibly RADS after. My daughter is going to 8 in three weeks from tomorrow and my step son is going to be 19 in early august. The 19 yo knows the \"whole\" story on what's wrong with me but my daughter has not been told the big C word yet. She's done great with all my test stuff and that I had this major surgery but I'm terrified at telling her I'm going to be bald and why. We originally thought I had stage 0 DCIS when this all started so chemo didn't seem in the cards....so why scare her? Well....chemo is in view now.... I asked her about a month ago if she knew the word cancer and what it meant and she told me \"Yes mommy, I do....it means when someone gets really sick and than they die\". OUCH!!!!!!! I wanted to curl up in a ball and cry.....how do I not scare her??? Any advice on how to tell her without scaring the crap out of her, a way to make it positive somehow so she knows her mommy isn't going ANYWHERE and that it's going to be ok......
