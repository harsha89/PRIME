Paulding mom - The first time I had cancer, (DCIS) I learned very little from my surgeon.  I searched the internet and learned a lot.  I went for a second opinion to a local dr. who actually sat me down and explained things - what was happening - etc. using pictures and flip charts.  She was wonderful!  Basically the same thing has happened this time.  The local dr. is now going to be my medical oncologist.  I did not use her before because I only had radiation and her center was not offering that treatment.  I think the internet is great and this site is great - at least it gives you a point of reference to help in developing questions.  I did not even know what to ask before.  I guess I'm also a little bolder this time and am asking more questions than before.  Best wishes to everyone this week!",

I don't know anything about expanders.  Again, I had a lumpectomy for the second time - I have had in both breasts now.  At the time of my surgery the dr. also implanted the port above my left breast.  Am getting along fine and was glad that her normal procedure is  place the port in at the same time that she does the other surgery.  Speaking about eating before surgery- I think sometimes the medical profession assumes that we know too much.  And, we're such emotional wrecks at the time of our visits that it's hard to really comprehend anything.  My boyfriend went with me and he heard things that either I did not hear - or simply did not want to hear.  LIke you I have good times and bad times.  I have finally gotten to the point that I can talk about it without crying.  I too, am really scared about the chem.  I just want to get started so that I know how it's going to affect me.  The unknown factor is the scariest part.  We can read all these posts about everyone else's experiences, but everyone is different and will react different.  When I had my first radiation treatment, the technician said \"You ARE going to be fatigued - no doubt about it.  Well fortunately for me that did not happen.  I had a very stressful position, at that time as assistant supt. of schools and was working 50+ hours most weeks the entire time I was taking radiation.  So, I learned to listen and prepare for the worst, but certainly hope for the best.  To me, it's kind of like getting a prescription filled and you get that print-out of everything that could possibly go wrong - well if you really thought that all that stuff would happen we'd never want to take any type of medicine. I think my control and my strength comes from trying to protect everyone else.  My parents are 82 years old and I'm trying real hard to put up a good front for them.  I think we all have to handle this in our own way and if you need to cry - don't try to stop it - by all means cry and DO NOT make yourself believe that crying makes you weaker.  That's what I plan to do .  Best wishes - let me hear from you!",

I'm on prochlorperazine (10mg) for nausea.  They also gave me something in my IV.  I was not given Emend.  Nurse advised me to begin the meds night of infusion and then every 6 hours.  I felt fine on Friday (infusion on Thursday) and then on Saturday felt completely washed out.  As you said, food did not look good and was nauseous even with meds.  Did anyone else feel nauseous while on their meds?  Never threw up and felt better lying down - slept most of Saturday and Sunday.  Was able to return to work on Monday, but could not wait for the day to end.  Felt almost good as new on Tuesday.  My next treatment is July 23. Susie - I have a man friend, and we've been together almost 5 years, but I don't know that I can let him see me without a wig.  He's never even seen me with wet hair - much less no hair.  He is balding and would probably be OK with it - just not sure that I'll ever be OK.  I love your hair! Had labs done last Thursday and everything looks good.  Hope that continues because I don't want the Neulasta shot.  Dr. said that she would only give it if absolutely necessary. Gjlanders - I'm so envious of your Paris trip and hope that you feel great.  This is a place that man friend and I have talked about going.  We went to London for Christmas in 2007. Mamaq - My blood count was 2.4 and I understand that number is low.  However, the nurse said that they use an equation of several numbers and items in the blood.  That total is OK as long as it's at least 1,000 and mine was 1800+.  Maybe your center does the same thing as mine.  I was told that mine should be coming up this week.  Carolyn & Polly - Was your second AC a lot worse than the first?  Are you going every 3 weeks x 4 and then 12 weeks of taxol? Like several of you, food tastes different or no taste at all.  I'm experimenting with some different colas.  I drank a Diet Sun Drop that tasted really good this weekend.  I could actually taste the lemon-line flavor. Do any of you have strange sensations to cold drinks?  It feels like I can feel the liquid going all the way down my throat.  And my toothpaste seems to make my mouth tingle also. Carolyn - I had a couple days over the weekend where my eyes watered - seems to be better now. I went to the LGFB class this afternoon.  Mine was all about make-up - no wigs were shared.  And, I was the only person who showed up for the class.  In some respects that was good, cause I got individualized treatment.  The bag of make-up is very nice.  I plan to visit a cancer center in a nearby town tomorrow or Wednesday and see what they have in their \"wig room\".",

Rinna - We have a similar diagnosis.   Dx 5/20/08, surgery 6/1/09, IDC, 2.4 CM, Stage IIa, Grade 3, ER-/PR-, HER2-.  I saw oncologist yesterday and I will starting A/C July 2 every 3 weeks x 4 - followed by taxol weekly for 12 weeks - followed by 6 weeks of radiation. Is anyone involved in any clinical trials?  My dr. thinks it's in my best interest to participate in a trial for bevacizumab (Avastin).  Regarding the free scarves.  I went on-line several days ago and emailed the person, who I believe was the CEO.  To date, no response, so I think I'll give them a call.  Did you pick out the one you wanted prior to calling?  Can you pick from any or are there just a few to pick from? Next week will be busy as dr. is lining me up for all sorts of scans, etc.  I think bone, MUGA and something else.   I understand from a friend that the cancer center here is excellent.  She said that when they get you started, you are covered with a warm blanket.  Each chair has its own TV and they are constantly asking if you want something to eat.  If you're there over lunch, they bring you something to eat from the hospital cafeteria. Sounds like lots of pampering for the patients - just what we need! Best wishes to each of you for a wonderful , nausea free, fatigue free weekend! Pam",

TomniDi - if Diane does not like the prick - maybe she can ask for a prescription for this.  I'm telling you it was wonderful!   Girls - I got my wig today.  The stylist at the salon was wonderful!  If you get a wig from ACS, don't be disappointed when you first get it -  take it to your stylist and let her work with it. I really was not super happy when we finally got a color that matched by hair - but the stylist cut it the way I wear my hair and I must say that I am pleasantly surprised.  My hair is fine - have never had a \"crowning glory\" but it's mine and I would love to keep it. Also, something else I learned today.  I wear my hair parted on the side and since it fine, the part, or my scalp is very distinct.  You can purchase wigs with an insert on the top that looks like your scalp!  I really think my \"new hair\" looks fairly natural - hope others think so as well.  I think I'll put it on one night this weekend and see what my man friend says.  I also purchased the shampoo, hair spray and a brush for maintenance.  have a great weekend -",

I also know how you feel about working.  Part of me would just like to hiberate in my house until all of this is over.  But I work with a great group of folks -  there are about 70 of us all together, but only about 9 in my administrative office.  And, we work with children and adults with developmental disabilities so they are so tuned in to HIPPA laws, and working with people who are going through difficult times - and who look different. They have to this point been extremely concerned and helpful.  My boss, has said \"do whatever you need to do - but the first thing you do is to take care of yourself.\"  I am very lucky to have such a supportive group to work with. As for me with the hair - my hair has fine texture - never had gorgeous hair - but it's mine and I'd love to keep it.  When I went wig shopping at the salon, everything at first looked fake.  The main thing, I think was that I've always parted my hair and the wigs did not really have a part in them.  When I mentioned that, she said look at this one.  The wig actually has a piece sewn into the top which made a very natural looking part.  It was expensive, but I had a $200 voucher from a foundation here to help pay for it.  I'm trying it on each night to try to get used to looking at myself in it.  The hairdresser put it on me and styled it similar to my current hairstyle - just not as short as what I'm doing now.   Take care and try to stay focused on the future and the end of treatment!  Remember to take care of yourself first - listen to your body. ",

Polly - just curious - is everyone a candidate for DIEP or are there certain issues that would prevent you from having it.  I suppose is someone were real thin and had no belly fat it would present a problem - but I do not have to worry about that!   By the way, I love my port.  Have small veins and the port has been wonderful!!  Fortunately, mine was put in at the time of my surgery.  Mine is a \"power port\" and can also be used for other things - like MUGA scan!!  Advice on port - the seatbelt on my car hits my port and is uncomfortable so I bought (from WalMart) one of those cushioned things that fits around the seatbelt.  I really don't know what they are called, but you probably know what I mean.  They are in the car accessories department and it just velcros around your seatbelt - really helps! I feel good so far after 4th AC today.  Dr. used some different meds this morning.  They think I have anticipatory nausea.  I began feeling bad during first 20 minutes of A infusion on TX3.  I still feel this comes from a nurse telling me after TX2 that I would not want to come back after TX 3!!  So, I get in there today and sat down in the chair and immediately felt it coming on.  They tell me they see it all the time - one patient they had started throwing up the minute he enter the center door.  New Meds seems to work well so far.  I have something to take tomorrow and Sat. a.m. in addition to Emend pill.  The whole thing kind of made me feel weak - I felt that I had handled the entire ordeal very well emotionally.  They said that I could not look at it that way - to just sit back and let them handle it for me - and they did.  Congratulations to everyone, including ME, who had last AC this week!   Dear man friend is taking me to the Grove Park Inn in the North Carolina mountains for a beach music festival so I'm praying for few SE this weekend.  He planned this early on as a celebration of finishing up the Bad Stuff!  Have a great weekend everyone!  Love, hugs and prayers to all!!!!!

Has anyone heard of Magic Mouthwash.  It's a prescription - was told to use this if I get mouth sores.  You swish it around and then swallow it 30 minutes before meals and at bedtime.  Nurse said that the sores can also go down your throat - reason for swallowing.  Other ideas on my little fact sheet for mouth sores: What to eat and drink. Use a straw to drink liquid and take small bites and chew food completely Soften food with milk, broth, gravy, juice, yogurt, butter, jelly or other liquid if needed.  Use a blender to mash or blend fruits and vegies. If cold feels good, suck on ice chips.  Personally, the ice cream sounds better to me. Drink 8-10 large glasses of caffeine-free liquid each day.  Keep a water bottle with you always Try to eat at times of day when mouth pain is less intense. Swish and gargle with warm water to moisten mouth before eating. For thick saliva, try sipping 100% papaya juice which contains natural substances that can thin saliva Try high-calorie liquids and semi-soft foods,such as fruit smoothies or shakes, warm soup, pasta, etc. avoid spicy, salty or citrus foods that can irritate avoid tobacco and alcoholic beverages How to treat: start using the magic mouthwash rinse with warm saline solution mouth rinses keep mouth and lips moist by using lip balm brush teeth with a soft toothbrush or toothette after each meal. Betina - good luck tomorrow - does this mean that after tomorrow you are 1/2 through? I was a little down today after my visit.  Dr. said that I could probably continue to work on the 4 treatment - every 3 weeks schedule; however nurse said today that I would  see a huge difference with fatigue with the 3 and 4th treatment.  I'm going to remember that everyone is different and try to keep a positive attitude.  If I have to take a leave of absence - that's what I'll do to fight this thing!!!  Take care everyone!",

For me, and probably for most of us it's fear of the unknown.  Hopefully, after the weekend I'll feel better at least in terms of knowing what to expect every three weeks.  by the way, I'll be on A/C every 3 weeks for 4 infusions, followed by 12 Taxol treatments, followed by radiation.  I'm also on the Avastin clinical trial.  I've already been given a prescription for a mouthwash and some type of anti-nausea med.  Have not picked up from store yet, so I don't know what the nausea med is.  The mouthwash is called \"magic mouthwash\".  What meds are you on?  I've had my wig for about 2 weeks now - am trying it on every night and playing around with it to try to get used to wearing it.  I also have a scarf and will probably get a few more.  My hair is fine and my fear is that it will take a while to grow back in.",

Polly - Radiation was not bad at all for me.  Technician told me at the first visit that I would be fatigued, but that did not happen.  I was working a very stressful job with school district 50+ hours per week.  I left at 4:00 for a treatment and returned back to work most of the time.  My skin tolerated the treatment very well.  It's a little darker where they radiated.  The last 8 treatments, for me, were called boost treatments and they move the machine much closer to the skin and place it right above the incision.  Where my incision is remains numb and will probably always be that way.  It's a piece of cake compared to chemo! Renee - Video was wonderful! Susie & Rinna - Sorry to hear about things getting harder for you.  I wonder if that's what is in store for me since I'm on the same treatment as you.  Someone at work told me that they heard breast cancer treatment was the hardest any patient has to go through. Like most of you, I'm loosing a lot of hair.  I wash it every day - dry it - and then get the vacuum cleaner out.  Started wearing my \"other hair\" to work on Monday. Today, I'm home from work.  White blood count is low and I've kind of put myself into seclusion.  Well, I really wanted to go to work but dear man friend thought otherwise and since he's taking care of things, I decided to listen to him. Rinna & Greytmon - I'm not a coffee drinker but love tea - especially McDonald's tea.  But it's not good anymore, so I've been experimenting with some other drinks - Diet Rite Cola and Diet SunDrop are two that seem to taste good to me.  Tea seems to be getting better but there's another treatment around the corner. cs34 - What is Acidophilus (probiotic) - were did you get it? U32374 - It the Activia drink like Activia yogurt?  Best wishes today on your treatment. I too had a pity party this week.  My former next-door neighbor lost her daughter to Cervical cancer on Wednesday.  I lost a friend to BC this week.  One of my best friends is tending to her husband, who was recently diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor.  My hair began falling out on Tuesday and my white blood count was way.....down yesterday.  So, I've placed myself in isolation and am home today.  Fortunately, my boss is allowing me to do some work from home on days when I don't need to be around people.   You all know that some days/weeks it takes more energy to keep a positive attitude.  This was one of mine.",

Thanks Diane - I will certainly try to find one. Polly - Interested to hear you say that you're having rads after double MX.  I've only had lumpectomies but am thinking about going for the total MX.  When I mentioned this to my surgeon last month - she said well that's a decision you need to make prior to radiation - because you won't need the radiation if you do the MX.  So, mentioned it also to my medical oncologist and she agreed.  What's the difference between DIEP and tranflap and why did you choose DIEP?",

Susie - Congrats on completing the AC? I know that emotionally you must feel great - but did the 4th red devil affect you worse. I keep hearing cumulative SE and I know that even after my 2nd treatment, that it seemed to take a extra day to get past the fatigue. Just saw your last post.  I was only radiation for DCIS in 2006. My man friend wanted me to attend a conference with him in Toronto and I was a little over half through my treatment. Dr. said that I could go if I promised to have a treatment that morning before I left which was a Fri. We returned on Wednesday and I got a treatment that day and thanks to a wonderful technician who came in the following Saturday and gave me a treatment. The way it was explained to me it had something to do with how far along with the treatments I was at the time of the trip. I had 36 treatments. And, don't know about you, but my last 8 treatments in 06 were called boost treatments. The treatment was a little stronger and they put the machine within inches of my incision; Although I really could not tell physically that the dosage was stronger. Tom n Di - Congrats to you also on graduating from AC - hope Di feels better soon! Let us know how the Taxol goes. Everyone have a great weekend! I'm feeling pretty good after 2nd treatment on the 23rd. BP has been elevated and food does not taste as good, but that will hopefully get better. Pam",

I will add you and your family to my prayer list.  I was feeling so upbeat from everyone at dr. office because they all said Taxol is a piece of cake after AC - but now not feeling so good about it.  I know that everyone is different so I'll have to just wait and see.  Lcmag - I learned early on to type my responses in MS Word and then paste into the website - after loosing a long post late one night.  I'm on the Avastin trial and was never told SE would be worse either!!!!  I guess if they told us that - that no one would ever go on the trials - but it's not fair to keep it from us.  Did your dr. recommend the B6 and Zinc or how did you know to take it? Polly - good luck tomorrow - I'll be anxious to hear how you do with Taxol. Pam",

Now, this might not be the case this time - because I did have one dr. say that sometimes after chemo the fatigue is a little worse.  However, that certainly may not be the rads - but simply chemo left in the body.  Anyway, again, please be assured that it's not bad.  It's very annoying to have to go EVERY DAY! As for me - had #6 of  Taxol today! If you pray, please add my best friend's husband.  He has an inoperable Stage IV brain tumor and is not doing well. Pam",

      "Content": "Jun 9, 2009 07:24PM - edited Jun 9, 2009 07:28PM by pdaw junebug - How are you feeling?  How brave you are to go ahead with shaving your head.  I had that discussion with my man friend last night and he said you really ought to cut your hair real short and go ahead and begin wearing the wig.  I really don't have a wig yet, but have picked out several from the internet that I like.  The salon that I am being referred to has a great website. I had not thought about the wig being itchy - the only thing I've heard others say is that they can be hot.   I know how you feel about talking about it.  Nothing you are feeling is strange - we all have to deal with it in our own way. I just got off the phone with a friend and I realized that I could talk to her without breaking down.  I return to surgeon tomorrow for follow up from last week's surgery and pathology report.  Hopefully, I'll have good clean margins and not have to return to surgery.  She also placed a port in last week and I'm ready for her to remove this bandage so I can see what the skin looks like.  Jewlls - hang in there and know that all of us will be thinking about and praying for your recovery.  I have learned so much from others here on these discussion boards.  As you read through these posts, you will probably think of some questions to ask your Onc.  I know that I'll have some as soon as I find out what chemo treatment I will actually be on.  I really did not know there were different kinds until I started reading this discussion board.  Like you, I'm happy that the tumor has been removed.  Now, I'm anxious about what the path report says about the lymph nodes.  Happy birthday yesterday! Steinunn - it appears from other posts that poor sleep is a major SE with AC.  Good luck with your decision on the wig.  I hope to look within the next week for one.  I don't think I can wait until it starts to fall out.  A friend from church told me that she was out of town when she noticed her hair falling out.  She said that she put the car window down, stuck her head out and ran her fingers through her hair and it just came out in bunches.  Her husband said \"what are you doing\"  Her response:  I'm giving the birds my hair to build a nest with.  She was very brave - did not like her wig because it was hot.  She wore baseball hats most of the time.  She actually had a pink baseball cap from Baldhead Island that her daughter-in-law gave her as a gift.  I'm happy for you that your treatment went well.  Let's hope that your feelings with the wig will go as well.  Don't wait too long.  I've heard too many people say that they began loosing their hair around day 14-15.  If you'd like the website of the salon that I'm using let me know.  They have a great selection. zuzee - So we can drink wine on chemo - that's great news!!  I agree with you and will probably at least cut my hair very, very short prior to it falling out.  That's one thing that I can control.  Regarding the radiation - I had DCIS in 2006 and the 1st thing the technician said to me was count on being fatigued.  Well, that did not happen to me - I worked every day  - and some weeks 50+ hours per week because we had something very serious happening at work.  My advice - at least to myself is - listen to everything and wait to see what happens with your body.  Everyone is different - as so very evidenced by these posts.  Keep that positive attitude - I believe that's a big part of our battle! Betinna - so happy to hear that 1st treatment went well for you.  That gives the rest of us great hope for our first treatment! rinna - I guess I just assumed no alcohol - good to hear that zuzee could still have a little glass of wine. Pap - Like you, I'm very concerned about loosing eyelashes, 'cause I've always had nice, long lashes.  But you know what, I think I can get those at WalMart!  Like you, I'll try real hard to think of the chem and radiation as a \"friend\".  I think it's a great way to approach it - once you get over the initial diagnosis shock. Greytmom - I have not startment my treatments yet - but feel like I've had chemo brain every since the diagnosis!  Everyone have a great night and for those of you having treatments tomorrow - best wishes to you!",

I too have handed all of this over to a higher being - it's way too big for me to handle by myself. I receive some good pre-information from my cancer center.  They gave me a whole bag of stuff including information sheets on different things that could happen - constipation, diarrhea, low blood count, etc.  On each sheet it tells you how you will feel if this is happening - what to eat - what to take and when to call them back.  Also received a cookbook - \"Eating well with Cancer\".  It's really good and has recipes and shopping lists for all the Side Effects.  If anyone is interested, I'll post more info regarding the book. One thing I've learned is to always take something to do - even for regular check-ups.  My dr. office seems to pride themselves on keeping appointments timely, but occasionally something goes wrong.  I'm planning to keep a small paperback in my purse all the time.  Joni - are you sure that what you see is swelling.  I had my put in June 1 during my lumpectomy surgery and I have a bump where it's located. Gillyone - I had a CT, bone scan and MUGA also.  I have no lymph node involvement - but was told that it was possible that one microscopic cancer cell could have still slipped through the nodes.  I started my treatment July 2 - A/C every 3 wks. x 4 and then Taxol, weekly x 12, followed by radiation.  I began listening to the june threat.  This is the place to learn a lot from each other.  Keep the faith! Good luck to all having their first treatment this week! Pam",

I agee with all of you in support of a port.  Mine is called a \"power port\" and apparently is relative new at least to my local hospital.  I had my surgery at the medical school 30 miles away, but am having my treatment locally.  The cancer center here and the hospital wanted copies of my port instruction booklet.  My oncologist said that it's wonderful because it can be used for other tests and to draw blood if absolutely necessary.  I'm a little sad tonight - a good friend and Rotary brother, lost his wife this afternoon to BC.  She fought a courageous battle for more than 15 years.  If you pray tonight, please add the family of Benita to your prayers.",

I think the food idea is nice for your family -did not go back to see if you have children at home.  My dear man friend is very particular about his food - used to be a total vegetarian.  Does not eat beef or pork.  So we eat a lot of poultry, seafood and pasta.  I have learned to cook for him - just a matter of using the proper sugar, flour etc.  Don't know how much cooking I could have done on day 3 and 4.  I took the compazine for nausea and pretty much slept those 2 days away.  I had cooked up soup, meatloaf, pasta salad and some other items for us to eat and we made out fine.  I returned to work on Monday - though was glad to see the clock strike 4:00. O2bhealthy - I purchased the Biotene and then my oncologist gave me a prescription for something called \"magic mouthwash\".  You swish it around 30 minutes prior to eating and then are supposed to swallow it.  - have not been able to swallow it yet - it's not that the taste is awful but it's like swallowing your mouthwash and you know you're not supposed to do that - guess it a mind game.  I think what I had was an inflamed tastebud - better now since using the mouthwash 4x a day.  I was having trouble with my Crest Prohealth toothpaste tingling a bit much so I purchased the Biotene toothpaste and it's great! Lorrijo 1993 - My dr. recommended Sennacot-S for constipation and it works well - has a stool softener which also helps.  They told me to take something if I had problems after 3 days.  This time, I'll probably take something sooner, cause I know what's going to happen.  I'm normally pretty regular, so I know when my body is doing something crazy.  The C went away after about a week. Elizabeth - what a beautiful story you have to share.  Wanda - I agree the lidocaine is wonderful!!!! Gil - My dressing was a type of water-proof bandage that stayed on over a week until I went back for my checkup and then dr. removed it.  I was told it was OK to take a shower after 48 hours - just don't let water pound on the bandages. Loving life today - I love OJ but went cold turkey after the first treatment and started drinking Cranberry/Apple or Cranberry/Grape juice.  It's good for you cause it does not have the acid that OJ has. Linda Sue - Did they give you something for nausea in your IV prior to infusion?  I got that, and also began taking meds that evening.  Felt nothing until Saturday (infusion on Thursday)  Sorry for the long post - trying to catch on my reading",

Kathy16 - I noticed my hair shedding a bit on day 13.  This is day 19 and I'm still shedding.  I wash it every day .  I see a lot  in the drain and then have to get the vacuum cleaner out after I dry it.  My hair is very fine, and I still have hair all over my head - just getting very thin.  I started wearing my wig to work on Monday, day 12, because I thought it would start to fall out that week anyway.  Since your hair is very thick you may be OK until your stylist returns. Mnikityger - welcome to a great group - just ask anything.... Shae - I think we are all terrified of that first infusion.  However, once it was over, I slept better that night than any night since my diagnosis. Pauldingmon - I agree with the ginger ale.  I also purchased some ginger snap cookies that I plan to try this time. Lovinglifetoday - I hope you had a good day and SE are minimal.  Something that has been good to me is the Crystal Light mix.  I buy the individual packets - however, can't use an entire packet in my water - that makes it too strong.  I enjoy the orange.

Wanda - good luck on 2nd AC Hoping for a cure -  my wrap was beautiful - but the note, signed by everyone in Laurie's office made me cry also!  Pam",

Joni1 - Hang in there.  My worst days are day 3 and 4.  My treatment is on Thursday, so that gives me the weekend to get over it.  The first time I took compazine for the nausea and it pretty much knocked me off my feet.  This past Thursday, dr. gave me emend and it worked really well until last night, when I began to feel queasy so I took another compazine last night and this morning.  I did manage to make it to church but it was a struggle to stay awake.  My WBC went down and I really was surprised because I did not feel any different.  I thought that you were supposed to feel washed out.  Anyway, it was up enough that I did not miss my treatment last week.  Best wishes to you.  Eat as much protein as you can - eggs, cheese are all supposed to be good for WBC.  Like you, my dr. will only give neulasta if I need it. My sense of taste seemed to come back about 7-10 days prior to the next treatment. Shae - I use the lidocaine numbing crème and it's wonderful - I have never felt even the slightest prick.  LindaSue - my blood is checked weekly - I had my 2nd AC last Thursday.  It went pretty much like the first except dr. added emmed in the IV.  It worked really well until last night, when I felt a little queasy.  Hope things go well for you on Wednesday.",

Kathy - like you my employer has been most gracious in asking if I need time off and is going to let me use the intermittent FMLA as needed.  I am on Adramyacin and have gotten along fine - you are absolutely correct - everyone is so different.  That's what makes that first treatment so scary! Lori - can't wait to visit K-mart.  Have not found any really cute hats anywhere else.  niknak0320 -   Personally, I've had the constipation, the instructions from my dr. if it should occur are:  What not to drink: milk, coffee or alcohol What not to eat: fried, fatty, greasy, spicy foods, raw fruits and vegies, beans, popcorn, nuts high fiber or bran cereals What to drink: 8-10 large glasses of non-caffeinated fluid a day (sounds weird, but guess that's to keep you from getting dehydrated) drink a little at a time, as often as you can What to eat: eat several small meals follow BRAT diet - bananas, rice, applesauce, toast Instructions from my dr on how to treat: 2 caplets (4mg) of Imodium A-D at the first sign of diarrhea, and then take 1 caplet (2 mg) after each subsequent stool. If this does not control, then increase Imodium A-D to 1 caplet (2mg) every 2 hours Continue taking the Imodium until you have no diarhea for 12 hours Then instructions say, if after following the above and still have 4 or more BM then call the nurse. Also call nurse, if you have bloody stools, nausea and/or vomiting with the diarrhea, or fever. Hope this helps. Pam",

I had bilateral M on Feb. 18 with immediate Latismus Dorsi reconstruction.  I was taken back around 7:30 am and my family was notified that I was coming out of recover about 8:00 pm.  What a journey this has been, but I'm finally feeling better.  I'm actually doing a little cooking and cleaning now.  But, I'm not through - when this heals, then I go in for the nipple reconstruction.  I'm also still going to cancer center, because I signed up for a new study - I'm taking Zometa, which hopefully will prevent the ugly beast from my bones.  Good to hear that you all are doing well.  I speak to Quarter occassionally - keep her in your prayers.  She is staying near the hospital where she is taking her radiation. It's the same hospital where I had my surgery and I had hoped to get to meet her while I was there.  But, I was so in and out of it that I would not have enjoyed the visit. take care - Pam",

And again at the end.  At least, this was my experience.  I have a friend who does not use the creme and says she feel nothing because they pull the skin tight and then use the needle.  You are on the same med as me.  I got along fine day 1 and 2 and then started to feel fatigued on 3 & 4. I slept a lot and ate very little but don't know how much of that was from the nauseous meds I was taking.  I want to try to continue working, so I scheduled my treatment on Thursday.  By Monday, I went back to work, but was ready for \"quittin' time\".  By Tuesday and Wednesday - good as new!  Good luck! Prv - my treatment plan is the same as yours.  Read above for how I got along with first treatment.  I've had a few other things to happen since that first weekend.  My mouth and throat are more sensitive to cold and heat.  I have what appears to be an inflamed taste bud on the end of my tongue.  However, I had this once before years ago, so it may have nothing at all to do with treatment.  I've also had a couple of small places on my lip. - just little red spots  I've never had a fever blister and anyway it does not look like one.  I'll ask about these little annoyances when I go for bloodwork tomorrow.  I agreed to the clinical trial, because my doctor thought that I should.  She is not only my dr. but also my friend and I'll do whatever she tells me to do.  And, she is known to be one of the top 5 oncologists in the United States.  I also had some constipation for a couple of days but used the suggested over the counter Sennacot-S and it worked fine.  Hope that makes you feel better about the trial.  The side effects from this don't really worry me any more than those of the other drugs.  And, there's a chance you won't be on it anyway.  The first time is the worst cause the A takes 30 minutes - the C takes 30 minutes and the clinical trial of Avastin takes 90 minutes.  Next week my Avastin will be 60 minutes and the next time and all future times will be 30 minutes.",

LindaSue - you and your family are in my prayers.  Dr. added the Emmend in IV form to my 2nd treatment and it really helped.  She gave me that + an Emmend pill for the next 2 nights after treatment #3. Gillyone - I try to remember take a Sennacot each night or in the morning for about a week after treatment - helps a lot.  Was also told today that I could add some Mirilax if I needed it.  Nurse said that it has no taste so you can mix it with anything.  Take care everyone!

My PS wanted me to wait a year so I just had my nipples done March 4.  Anyway, he took some fat from my stomach and did lipo to my breasts to take care of some rippling that was occurring with the implants.  He said that this had nothing to do with his part of the surgery but had something to do with the way the mastectomy was done.  I was wondering if what I had done is what you are calling fat grafting.  It felt really nice at first, but I've realized since the swelling has gone down that I still feel some rippling.  My PS was very pleased with how everything looked - but I still had some swelling at that point.  I see him again in a couple of weeks Is the rippling something that I'm going to have to accept or will.  Why did you have to have additional grafts?",
