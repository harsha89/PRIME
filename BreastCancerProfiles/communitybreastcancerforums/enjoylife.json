I guess what I am trying to say is that I have thought since my diagnosis how many mean and minipative   people there are out there and why does this have to be such a hard road for a young lady and productive person like the lady you all knew Kim.

      "Content": "Aug 13, 2009 02:07PM enjoylife wrote: For decades, many doctors warned that lifting weights or even heavy groceries could cause painful arm swelling. New research shows that weight training actually helps prevent this problem. \"How many generations of women have been told to avoid lifting heavy objects?\" Dr. Eric Winer, breast cancer chief at the Dana-Farber Cancer Center in Boston, lamented after seeing the surprising results of the new study. \"Women who were doing the lifting actually had fewer arm problems because they had better muscle tone.\" The study was led by Kathryn Schmitz, an exercise scientist at the University of Pennsylvania, and funded by the federal government. Results are in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. More than 2.4 million Americans are breast cancer survivors, and the study could mean a big difference in their quality of life. Cancer treatment-related arm swelling now appears to be one of many ailments made better by exercise - not worse, Schmitz said. Well-meaning (but wrong) advice \"Fifty years ago we told people who had a heart attack not to exercise anymore,\" and people with sore backs to heal with bed rest, Schmitz said. \"It was well-meaning advice but it was polar opposite of the truth.\" Women who have had radiation to the armpit, or lymph nodes removed to check for cancer, can suffer lymphedema - a buildup of fluids that causes painful and unsightly swelling of the arms or hands. To avoid it, doctors have advised women to avoid using the affected arm to lift toddlers, carry a heavy purse or scrub floors. Even activities like golf and tennis raised concern. Women think, \"Oh, my God, I need to baby the arm,\" Schmitz said. Lifting weights - which boosts mood, muscle mass, bone strength and weight control - was thought to be a bad idea for women prone to lymphedema. Schmitz challenged that notion with a small study several years ago, finding that weight training did not make lymphedema worse. Her new study is the first one large and long enough to give clear proof that this is so, and even suggests that weight lifting can help. It involved 141 breast cancer survivors who had suffered lymphedema. Half were told not to change their exercise habits. The rest were given 90-minute weightlifting classes twice a week for 13 weeks at community gyms, mostly YMCAs. They wore a custom-fitted compression garment on the affected arm and gradually worked up to more challenging weights and repetitions. For the next 39 weeks, they continued these exercises on their own. The women's arms were measured monthly. After one year, fewer weightlifters had suffered lymphedema flare-ups - 14 percent versus 29 percent of the others. Weightlifters reported fewer symptoms and greater strength. Rates of change in arm size due to swelling were similar in both groups. \"I found it was really very effective. It not only gave me strength and mobility but it improved my balance and coordination,\" said one participant, Clare Faber, 66, of suburban Philadelphia. \"It really does offer women hope.\" Another participant, Gay McArthur, 56, of Smithfield, N.J., has continued weightlifting on her own since the study ended. \"When I first got diagnosed with lymphedema, they said I couldn't lift more than five pounds,\" she said. But weight training caused no problems and has made her feel better, she said. It also should save money, though the study did not measure this, Wendy Demark-Wahnefried, of the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, wrote in an editorial in the medical journal. In the study, the group of weightlifters made only 77 visits to doctors or physical therapists for lymphedema flare-ups versus 195 visits for the others, she noted. Another part of the study is evaluating whether weight training can prevent a first case of lymphedema in breast cancer survivors; results are expected soon, Schmitz said. Breast cancer survivors should not rush into weight training - that could trigger problems. Schmitz suggests:",

She also showed me how to wrap my arm half way I couldn't stand the confinement of the whole arm wrapped and I am getting a machine delivered this week that does a massage I never swelled until almost done with the chemo and I swelled from radiation they actually took out 29 lymph nodes only 4 were infected but she said I wanted her to clean house but I never dreamed it would cause this much trouble. I plan to go back a few time to PT after my surgery in June my Plastic surgery and I plan to get another sleeve the lady who ordered one for me one was too big one was too small so I am trying someone else. I think if I keep the exercise up too it will help and I watch all salts I never salt anything our food has enough in it as is. If you have any other suggestions I will listen. My arm does feel heavy at times I live in a small town without allot of help with this problem. I plan to go to the relay for life and discuss with the ladies this problem and its just as important to talk about this problem as any other part of the process, its like its a hidden problem in a closet ....Little town in MO..My brotherlaw teased me when I went back to boston to see my plastic surgeon he said please dont wave your arm around I am getting cold so we have to have some humor in it.

I am hoping it helps when the herceptin is done but they took out 29 lymph nodes my friend had 19 out and never swelled but she didnt have chemo like I did and rad so that is still coming out and causing problmes. I also take up to 5 potuism pills and 6 water pills a day to help with the fluid. I am trying and getting a new sleeve tomorrow the last lady didnt get the correct size and now I can tell if it is going to work or not if I cant find one here I will drive to St Louis to get fitted its very hard when you live in a town like this I had my surgery in Boston where I grew up and I am going to talk with the Cancer Society relay for life because not enough people talk about Lyphedemia at all and I do try to watch my salt I never salt anything but salt is in everything so its a job as you know by the way I only had 4 lymph nodes infected but my surgeon said  Itold her to clean house that is why 29 came out, I do use the pump in the evening no it doesnt drain just masages but I have to massage befroe I use it. I would love to tell someone not to get disgusted just work with it and it can be overwelming but we are strong that is why they made the women gender ... Do you know of any DVD's that might help me to watch it also please let me know its very hot in MO and that is when my arm will swell this summer.

I am 18 months out of chemo and I wont wear a wig dont want to smother the folicles so I use a hat just my believes and my nails are starting to come around..

Sugar77 I sure hope none of you are picked to be affected by this and none of us were warned and YES I did ask if my hair would come back and was told yes and probaly more its a sad thing some of these ladies have battled the cancer and hair loss for 5 years and no one is imuned to it. I think all women should have a heart for these ladies and should make sure you tell your friends who have to take this drug that it has happened and can because no one else is telling them anything. I dont mean to come off harsh but it hurts me so much be have the problem it took 2 summers away from me the first was the chemo and then I thought I would be on my way back last summer and it didnt happen for me and I still have to wear a hat or get wierd looks and all I do is look at peoples hair and I have to work being single and a mother of 3 sons and they all have more hair then I do. I acutally had a derm. tell me I was left like this because my dad was bald hello i had so much hair before Taxotore they had to thin it to cut it. Please let anyone know to ask about the drug before they take it its the only way we can spread the word to help all the future women who can avoid this heartbreak. Maura",

Does anyone know how to handle this hair ok I think my hair has filled in since I finished chemo a year and 7 months ago I still have to wear a hat but i think my scalp is filling in sure isn't much in the crown area but how do you make it look thicker is there a trick I have never in my life had FLAT THIN hair and its straight so its not good at all and I don't think my hair dresser can do much more so far he hasn't we just clean it up another words shape it HELP its HELL my boob was nothing next to this its taken what self esteem I had away for sure....I also talked with a lady who had Taxotere who has 3 heads full of hair and she took and takes GNC norishment for hair yep I am going to try it too... I have tried Biotin, prenatal, Rogaine, vitiams B and D water pills that begin with a S they actually help allot and if you have lymphedema it helps with that too so it is doing 2 things at once.. just trying to help ..

If anyone has any thing to tell me about RAD I am all eyes and ears I will have Herceptin until next May but not the side effects of chemo but I have learned allot from the site on how to deal with the side effects and I am posting it on my ONG bulletin board for hints for other people. Not sure if anyone had a problem with drinking and eating a few days after but Cloraspective spray helped me numb my tong and mouth and it helped me eat and orange juice was the only thing that had a good taste if that helps anyone. I am going through the crying part now too I guess the chemo is over and I got the cry baby blues from it just knowing I did it with a few friends and my family at a distance they live away ecept my boys so I am having a pity party and when the flood gates shut I will stop my balling but right now its what I need I read somewhere else that this is norm what ever norm is ha thank you ladies again for being there and I will continue to be here and listen to all of you and pray for all of us ..

I didn't stay with that doctor in fact I completely left my 17 and 23 year old alone and went to my sisters for over a month and did my surgery and reconstruction started now half way done with chemo. Like these ladies have said it does get better once you have a game plan and make up your mind its not going to get you but you will get it and you look and sound like a lady who can do this and more. If I can leave these boys and let me tell you when got back my house smelt like a football locker room and get on with it anyone can I don't think any of us are ready for it at all but there is a very good book No place like Hope and its helped me sleep allot at night plus a sleeping agent which I believe in I cannot work full time and loose all the sleep I was loosing and I have to work as a single mom of a high school boy. Good luck and you picked a very good place to come to its helped me allot and make sure you pick a doctor you feel good about too. Maura",

I find if I elavate my arm at night it helps I am also meeing with a lady on campus who will show me how to set my arm up since I am infront of the computer all day and it makes it sore. Does anyone have any suggestions the rads has made the swelling a little larger still not bad since the weather has cooled off. Thank you for listening to me..",

I am a single and would like to have breast back but its just the same small size I was I actually had my hairdresser say that is a good cheap way to get a boob job, I told her why dont you get bc so you can have a boob job dumb wasnt she when I get hair back she wont be cutting it at all..Please let me know your comments on this its just a thought for now..
