That is the current Phase III trial.  There is a lot of other information available also.  There is not the same amount of research on ABPI vs. WBI-- that's the reason for the Phase III trial.  There was no mold of the breast. I haven't heard of that.  Can you tell me about it?  It's not in the B39 trial guidelines.  I did have images taken which were used by physicists to determine the radiation fields.  Regarding your last question, typically, as far as I am aware, nothing is done to protect the rest of your body.  The 3D external beam is very specific.  The areas possibly at risk are your lungs, heart, esophagus, thyroid, and probably some other areas that I don't remember.  It's not possible to avoid radiation to some of those areas, but it is much better than it was, say, in the 80s, and I don't know of any studies which suggest that ABPI is worse the WBI in that regard.  Some centers use a breathing device to lessen radiation to the lungs in ALL patients who are radiated; the one where I was treated didn't do that.  Hope this answers your questions.  Are you thinking of doing this?  You didn't say in your post.
