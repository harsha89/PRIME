Did not show fibroadenoma. Dr suggested removing for better biopsy results. my second opinion said lets wait and see. Lump has not grown or been reduced. Now i have a new lump, same area on my left breast. FNA said benign, but no news as to what the tumor is....now i went for an ultrasound, and it grew a bit, so they are doing a CORE on this new lump to see what it is. I am worried that they are not gettting a real answer as to what these are...if not fibroadenoma, then what?? I am 28 years old, no history of BC. I did get my period when i was 10, and was on hormone therapy for early puberty from age 7-10. Does anyone have a similiar story? Thank you so much!! Log in to post a reply",

Core biopsy to follow...now removal of the lump. the lump is attatched to a CYST, and is a peanut shaped 1.5cm solid mass. Report came back of the cyst and solid mass.....mentions Apocrine Metaphasia, but says benign, but may be discordant...I am confused about these terms, does anyone have a similiar path report?? thank you so much!! xoxoxoxox Log in to post a reply",
