      "Content": "maryds wrote: My mom has a deep fear for chemo and refuses chemo. She feels that chemo means death. She is almost 70 years old, and she has at least stage 3 breast cancer (we are waiting for scan results to confirm the stage). She is strongly ER positive, HER2 negative, which means hormone therapy therapy would work for her... but the doctor still recommends chemo... he said \"it'll increase her chances\" Can somebody who knows more about chemo share the experience of chemo treatment? Is it as bad as people say??? ~~~ I just talked to her about it this morning and shared what I read in this forum. She had a mental breakdown... Sigh. I guess it takes time. ~~~ Thank you ladies for all your replies. I've been talking to my mom, and she has made it very clear that she does not want chemo. She thought it through, and she said she has no regrets on the matter. She knows what she wants. It's her body, and her decision; and we've decided to back her on whatever she chooses.
