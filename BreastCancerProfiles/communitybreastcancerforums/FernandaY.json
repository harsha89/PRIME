In May I noticed a hard blood's spot on my right nipple so I tried to take it off but some kind of sticky thing came off and after that my nipple was blending for some days and then it became clearer I went to see a doctor and she sent me to a breast clinic in a big hospital here (Things here takes lots of time) almost 6 weeks later I had a appointment, the doctor said I have nothing to worry about but she asked for US, more 6 weeks waiting and I had my US, only thing the girl in the us said \"looks perfect\" (I don't feel that's good) and then I'm waiting again for an appointment to see the doctor with the us (that actually I didn't receive). It's been almost 6 months since that started, and it's persistent it only changes colour but it's always there. (No lumps, no familiar history) I'm very bad at waiting, and my discharge always changes, most of the time it's clear (on the tissue that is in my bra all the time it's a light yellow), but sometimes it's bloody, the stick thing came out once more 2 months ago, It was like a line coming out. I'm freaking out, if she said 'You have nothing to worry about' again after 5 months I'd be very disappointed. At this point I've read EVERYTHING about papilloma and bloody nipple discharge, and really don't know what wait for... If you have something to say that can help me, I'll be happy! Thank you!
