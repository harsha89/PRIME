I wanted to add a thank you to BethNY for her reply above.  It is great when someone shares their experience and knowledge and really helps when you get advice from someone going thru the same thing.  Thank you.

      "Content": "dk721 wrote: I was diagnosed on July 21st with IDC in a background of DCIS (this was from a biopsy I had because on my 1st baseline mammo there were calcifications).  The doctor who did the biopsy was a breast surgeon (not a breast cancer specialist) and told me this was not good and I needed a lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy.  I set it up with him then went home and thought about it.  After being very upset for days I decided to go to Sloan Kettering. I had a consult with a doctor there who was wonderful.  He immediately told me that the invasive part was very small, only 3mm and was mostly DCIS.  The margins weren't clean from my first biopsy so he did a re-excision and the sentinel node biopsy.  He assured me that he felt they would not find anything in the lymph nodes.  He explained things very well and made me feel so much better!  I also brought the slides with me from the first biopsy for them to review at Sloan Kettering.  I had the re-excision and SNB at Sloan on August 14th and went today for a follow up.  They told me that there was no more cancer in the re-excision so it was all removed with the first biopsy.  Also there was a very small amount (5 cells) in 1 of the 3 lymph nodes he removed.  He said they believe it is only escaped to the lymph nodes during the first biopsy and did not spread there.  After reviewing the slides from my first biopsy they said there was no \"invasive\" cancer only DCIS.  (This is why they believe the cancer did not spread to the lymph nodes).  The 3mm of \"invasive\" cancer which was found on the first pathology report was reported as \"attenuated myoepithelial cell layer\" on Sloan Ketterings report. (whatever that means!)  The doctor explained that there was a small area near the duct that was surrounded by membranes and not considered \"invasive\".  He also feels that because lumpectomy is always followed by radiation I do need radiation treatment but nothing further.  Now the first breast surgeon I went to told me it was \"invasive\" and if he would have done the sentinel node biopsy and found those 5 cells he would have definitelty took more (or all) of the lymph nodes.  I also would have had much more treatment that I am having now!  I am sure I would have had radiation and Tamoxefin (maybe chemo if it was in the lymph nodes??) Of course I am concerned about the 2 different diagnoses but am happy that the better one came from Sloan Kettering!  I do have a consult with a radiation oncologist on Friday, Sept 5th and I will see if he agrees with the treatment plan.  I will always be nervous that there is something more but am now at much more ease with this news. Sorry for being so long but wanted to let everyone know how 2 different doctors (and hospitals) find 2 different things from the same tissue!
