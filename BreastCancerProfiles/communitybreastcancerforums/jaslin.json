Everything went well except for the last 10 min. the nurse turned up the drip so I could get done faster and boy did it give me a whoppin headache. Even my sinuses filled up and left me with a funny taste. I'll make sure that doesn't happen again. Felt pretty good all weekend. Went to work on Monday and started to feel weird. It was like I was drugged (Ha) and very disoriented. I had a hard time concentrating and eveything irritated me. I've read about the fatiguge, nausea and heartburn, but those are manageable for me. Anyone else feel like this? In the afternoon I started to get clammy and broke out in a sweat. No temp thank goodness but I felt like crap. My job is very hands on and physical, I do activities with the elderly. One of the other girls in our office is dealing with throat cancer and doing chemo and rads now too. I feel like I need to give 100%, I just can't face going in there and asking to do paperwork. We're already short staffed with the other girl being sick. I had to call off today though-still feel clammy and sore, I didn't want to end up passing out at work. I'm sorry to ramble on, but I just feel so guilty. I know I shouldn't but I don't know how to help it. Any advice would help right now. Thanks!",

My appetite has increased awful and I've gained about 7 lbs after only 2 rounds. Even with my sour stomach I am constantly munching. I hate it and definately don't need the extra weight. It's frustrating!",

I got terribly constipated and am now making sure to eat lots of fiber. If the remaining 3 treatments affect me like the 1st I'm gonna get thru this! My head tingles now too, but I do not have any hair coming out yet. I did get the wigs I ordered, but they just don't look right or feel right either for that matter. I hope that they fit better without a head full of hair. I still can't face cutting or shaving my head yet. I am also worried about them falling off or getting blown off in the winter winds. Jane, do the gel headbands hold the wigs in place? I am getting very nervous anticipating the fallout. I just know that no matter how much I think I am prepared for it, I am going to be utterly devastated. MJ-where from Ohio are you? I'm in Navarre,near Canton.",
