When I was 17 I had 2 removed (one from each breast) because the pain was so bad I would wake up in tears and couldn't raise my arms above my head. I was hoping that getting rid of the two largest ones would stop my pain but it didnt. However, even after getting them removed I'm still in a lot of pain. I dont know what to do anymore becasue all of the doctors I see just tell me it's something I have to live with but that is not an option for me becasue it hurts me to run and I am on scholarship to run track in college. If this pain does not subside then I will have no other option than to quit and transfer schools, becasue I cannot afford this one without my scholarship. Does anyone know of a Doctor that will actually listen to me and do something to help me, please, I'm desperate.",
