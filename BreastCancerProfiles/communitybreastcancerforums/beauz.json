A few times, i was afraid of being thrown off the wagon due to side effects. But it was nothing compare to what you have experienced. Seems to me you had heart conditions caused by chemo. AC is known bad for heart. I hope your medical team can find a solution for your problems. With your condition, you may face some unique challenges from chemo, which may not be familiar to the marjority of chemo wagon riders. But we are here for you and each other. I know this site has been my life line. You have been through a lot! I would love to hear from you more. Thinking of you.",

My dosage was cut down by 15% after taxol #4 also because of the low count of neutrophils. My oncologist told me that I have completed 75% of my total scheduled chemo, it would not make much difference with further treatments. Also I may have a risk of permanent damage to my bone marrow if I continue with chemo. I am comfortable with the decision. There are a few women on current weekly taxol group forum who have to stop early because of various SEs. It may help if you read those posts at about 3 or 4 pages back from the last. Best wishes.",

My AC #1 and #2 treatment were relatively uneventful, just my usual side effects including one week constipation, bad taste in mouth for two days. For my AC #3, I developed temperature, low blood pressure, ponding heart and short of breath from day 3. So I went to ER on day 4, they couldn't find any infection. They gave me saline drip. Stayed in hospital over night. Felt better the next day. Then i had sore throat for a few days and fever on day 8 morning. Back to ER again. My oncologist requested nasal swab test for flu, which confirmed that I had influenza A. I was prescribed flu tablets. Stayed in hospital overnight. Got better the next day. Sore throat and fever were all gone. After AC #4 , I had trouble swallowing down food and water, like they stay in my oesophagus for a long time. I had to eat soft food and sip water. For weekly taxol, the side effects are so far manageable (fatigue, bad taste in mouth, mild numbness in feet). But the weekly infusions have been tortures. I had allergic reactions on taxol #1, so each time they start chemo at half rate for 30 minutes, then normal rate. I always feel so sick towards the end of infusion (bad smell in nose, awful taste in mouth, burning throat). Immediately after #1 and #4 infusion,I vomited. I had to skip two infusions in a row after #4 because of low blood counts. For taxol #5, my oncologist reduced the chemo dosage by 15%.",

My gut feeling is that my tumor located on the edge of the breast close to underarm and seemed to have well defined boundary. It's not how wide area the surgeon can take out, but how deep he can. I don't know if mastectomy can go deeper towards the chest. With these reasons, I agreed with lumpectomy. The surgeon already took out part of chest wall muscle. Even after the surgery, he still said he doesn't think mastectomy would help much. It's the chest wall part that I think may not have clear margins.

He said I can have mastectomy but I would still need radiation therapy in my case. I agreed with lumpectomy because 1. my lump was on the edge of the breast close to underarm, 2.my tumor has been attached to the chestwall wall. After chemo, the tumor was still not free moving from the chest. I don't know if mastectomy will help with the chestwall issue. I don't know how much chestwall muscle being taken, but my surgeon said he took as much as he can safely do so. Taking more than that, he is afraid that my breast would drop down. My post surgery pathology report is a mess. I don't have clear margins, especially on chestwall! The tumor was the same size , same stage and the same grade as before. But I am recovering well from the surgery. I had a drain for a week and 3/15 nodes positive. I have occasional sharp shooting pain on the surgery site. I have regained a good range of arm movement. My right breast has been a smaller breast, got even smaller after the surgery. I lost about a third of my right breast. With bra on, I can't tell much difference. However, with the loss of muscle and lymph nodes under arm, I do feel a lump towards the back of my armpit. When I walk and swing my arm, I feel skin rubbing against each other at the back of my armpit. If I wear bra with a bit of padding on the side, I feel normal there. Even with the messy pathology result, my surgeon still says he doesn't think more surgery will help in my case. I would ask my surgeon which surgery will give me a better chance of clear margins. Good luck. ",

I had total 33 rads including 8 boosters on tumor bed, radiation to chest wall and collarbone area. I was worried about my esophagus and lung exposure to radiation as my tumor was attached to chest wall. I mentioned my worries to RO at the initial consultation and she didn't respond much or I don't remember her response. I went through the treatment alright apart from an oozing nipple for ten days and catching a cold during the treatment. But I did develop a dry mouth a few days after finishing the treatment. My RO said my salivary gland was not in the radiation field but could be in the scattering field. I am still having dry mouth 4 months after rads, slowly improving. I had indigestion and swallow problems during my AC chemo. I had to eat semi solid or soft food, (like noodles, soup ) for a while and lost weight as results. I have since bounced back. Have you seen your RO about your troubles? Hope you get better.",

On my excised tissue, \" The deep muscle is extensively involved by directly invasive carcinoma and lymphovascular invasion.\" So no clear margins here. 3/15 nodes positive. The cancer mass is still 54mm. So the original mass was either much bigger or chemo has not worked much at all. My surgeon doesn't think mastectomy would make much difference.

Congratulations on your bi\u2026iig milestone! The reason I asked you about any pain at the surgical site is because I had that as well. Soon after the surgery I had a sort of pain which I could tell that it was from the surgery. After about 4 weeks the sharp shooting pain started which was similar to what I had just before my diagnosis. This got me confused because I don't have clear margins and the pain shot towards the nipple and the remaining breast. Of course doctors told me it was nerve pain. Hm\u2026 ironically, the sharp shooting pain eased after I started Xeloda. It becomes pins and needles kind of pain which is similar to i experienced during AC+T chemo. I hope this is a sign that Xeloda is working. As long as the pain is not persistent and worsening, I should not worry too much. 7 weeks after surgery, my surgeon said the scar healed nicely. I had a good range of arm movement accept hanging up washing. The day after seeing the surgeon , I went for a routine appointment with a physio therapist specializing in post BC surgery care. She told me I had chording problem and showed how to massage the area. A few days later, I could hang up washing like I used to. I am super pleased. Msrobin- very nice to hear from you finally!

They will not give me longer infusion time. I just want to get out of the torture chair as early as possible. The good news is that my neutrophils count has crawled back to 2.0 after taxol #5.

It's disappointing that your post-surgery pathology report does not favor lumpectomy. I would pay close attention to how clean the margin is. Could it be possible that the residual cancer scattered out the excised tissue? I would then make a decision from there. It really make me wonder if I made the right choice of surgery. My lump is still palpable, still seems to be attached to the chest wall. I couldn't finish the full course of chemo ( 11/16)\u2026\u2026 oh well. I hope your team can help you make the right choice.

You came back just when I missed checking chemo forum. Sorry to hear of your scary moment but relieved that it is benign! I had a tiny lump on the back of my lower neck that flared up for three days after being poked by my GP. She assured me it was a pimple. I felt so jumpy during those three days. Lol! Since the ultrasound and mammo missed to spot your BC, are you thinking of having MRI? My ultrasound and mammogram were inconclusive on my big visible lump. I was only told recently that I have dense breast tissue. My surgeon agreed to request MRI for me when the time comes. Somehow after my radiation treatment, my right breast felt denser than my left. Do you feel the difference? My right arm or shoulder felt tighter as well and letrozole seems to make it even worse. How are you doing with letrozole? Oh, I had bone density scan in July and I have osteopenia. Is your MO monitoring your bone health?",

I mostly read long term members' posts hoping to learn from their experience and stage III members' posts. I find that a lot of members having zometa or prolia treatment at the same time of their hormonal treatment. Because of my osteopenia and bone weakening letrozole, I am concerned of my bone health on top of BC crap. My MO only suggested vitamin D and weight bearing exercises. I think I need more than these. My MO said he can't prescribe me zometa or prolia for my bone health because it's not standard. I then raised my concerns with my GP. She said she can only prescribe me prolia and I have to pay full price of $300 for each treatment. I may take this option. I am also thinking entering some trial. My MO is looking into it. I live in a regional city and may have to go to major city for trials. Will see. I am still on my first box of letrozole. Things seem to be as usual except around day 20 when I started experience random abdominal cramps. On day 26 my cramps became constant all day. Day 27 I rang my nurse navigator about the cramps and told her I would not take letrozole on that day. She agreed, said she would get back to me but didn't. By the end of the day, my cramps abated. Day 28 (yesterday) I felt better, took letrozole and went to my GP appointment which was booked a while ago for unrelated issues. She managed to speak to my nurse and MO's registrar on the phone about cramps. They assured her that it's safe for me to keep taking letrozole and they don't think my cramps have anything to do with the medication. Then my GP took my urine sample, did strip test and said it looks like UTI. She sent it away for further lab tests. She prescribed antibiotics which I haven't started. She also told me to take Ural (main ingredient sodium bicarbonate). I took one and felt better. My GP charged me more than double of what I normally pay for her consultation, at a discount rate I was told. Can't complain!  ",

The cancer mass is still 54mm. So the original mass was either much bigger or chemo has not worked much at all. My surgeon doesn't think mastectomy would make much difference. He suggested more chemo in addition to radiation and hormone treatment. I will see my MO on Monday about further treatments options. One more weird thing, the excised tumor is \"invasive carcinoma of mixed type. Mixed of no special type(60%) and micropapillary type(40%), associated with high grad duct carcinoma in-situ of solid and cribriform type.\" I guess this will not change my treatment options much.",

My understanding from reading your post is that your IDCs were scattered in an area of dimension 5-7 cm, not a single mass of 5-7cm. The main feature of your lump is DCIS with IDCs scattered around in an area of dimension 5-7cm. Because IDCs spread apart, it's difficult to estimate the percentage. But I would think the majority of your lump is DCIS.Hope this will help. Best wishes for your up coming treatments.",

But I don't think my neuropathy was that bad with feeling of a thick pad under my foot. I think the real reason for stopping was my low neutrophils. It dropped too low after #4 and took three weeks to back up. MO then reduced my dose by 15%. But it dropped below chemo cutoff level again after #7 and stayed there for two more weekly blood tests. MO called it quits. He refused to prescribe me white blood cell boosters to keep me going. I was willing to move on from chemo as it had dragged on for too long. My surgeon said taxol should have done its job by then anyway. I remember at least two other members from my chemo time who didn't complete full course of taxol. But we are around 60 years young and ER+/PR+ only. If you read weekly taxol thread you may find more cases of stopping early or on reduced dose. I wish I could complete the full course of taxol.

My MO reduced the dosage of taxol after taxol #4 because of low neutrophils for two weeks in a row. But when I had another two low counts of neutrophils for two consecutive weeks, my MO called it quits. I then had surgery and didn't have a very good pathology report. Now I am on oral chemo Xeloda. I know from weekly taxol topic that a few women didn't finish the full course. Their MO told them it would not affect much their chance of recurrence. Seems you have a very good response to chemo. Best wishes to you.",

I listened to my oncologist of doing chemo without a port first. I had 4 ACs on my left arm by IV. I noticed my vein hurted at the inner part of elbow of the IV arm through out ACs, even though the actual position of the needles were away from there. During my taxol treatments, I rotated the IVs between my two arms until nurses had troubles getting the needle in at taxol #5 and #6. I then asked my oncologist for a port. But it was too late for that because of 3 weeks waiting time. I ended up having a picc line put in my left arm. When the picc line was taken out, I noticed the same vein at the inner part of left elbow pops out when I straighten the arm. It feels like a piece of string of 3cm long with a lot of tension in it. It hurts. It also hurts when I swing the arm as usual while walking. Somehow, my vein seems to be shortened. I will show it to my oncologist on my next appointment. I regretted being such a good gal not wanting to stir up! I think ACs have damaged my vein. So please ask for a port to put in ASAP. All the best.",

My oncologist doesn't like chemo IV done near joints, such as back of hand, because leaked chemo can damage joints which are harder to heal. Nurses seem to like putting IV on back of hand. I just tell them it hurts more there, so they have to try it on my arm. I am sorry this happened to you. Hope it hasn't done any damage to your joints.",

I know one other stage III member had lumpectomy after chemo treatment. I am at peace with my choice. My surgeon kept telling me that breast cancer , in particular, is very sneaky and very difficult to tell the prognosis. But if you go to stage III forum on this site, you will find a lot of long term stage IIIc survivors. Best wishes.",
