I have pretty much lost my mind because of my not knowing what is going on. I haven't slept 5 days straight because of shoulder blade / breast pain so that lack of sleep makes this all worse perhaps. I will try to stop stressing the worst on here and will come back after I see a specialist. Thank you and best wishes to everyone who has shared their info with me here.",

Is it possible for the FNA to diagnose fibrocystic breasts? They stabbed me pretty hard twice with the needle but I'm worried she missed an area somehow. I've never heard of pain like this from any of my friends my age so I feel skeptical. I have a follow up with her in 6 weeks. Hope everyone is well and thank you for your advice during this time.",
