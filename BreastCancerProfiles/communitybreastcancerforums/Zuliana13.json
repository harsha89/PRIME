I have the clear tape changed at least every other day because I use so much lotion and oils that it simply does not stay on or gets very gooey and the radiation tech has to change it. She doesn\u2019t seem too concerned so neither am I. As long as the marks are there, changing the tape daily is no big deal. Moisturizing for me is more important than worrying about that. Not feeling the fatigue yet. I\u2019m as active as I\u2019ve always been and other than the annoying sunburn feeling on my skin, so far not too bad. ",

I\u2019ve been treating it like a burn - went to a dermatologist - and he recommended crisco since it\u2019s non-medicated, non-allergenic, and Oil emulsion patches. It has made all the difference. Of course, each person is different but I\u2019m fed up with radiation docs and nurses saying it will go away and not giving any importance to the day-to-day as you\u2019re living it. They don\u2019t think it through , just mechanically throw names at the patient, as the \u201conly\u201d accepted treatment. I\u2019ve realized that they\u2019re not interested in our comfort but in the ease with which they can do their jobs. So, I stopped worrying about them and started taking care of me. Treatments have continued normally and the world didn\u2019t end! Ha! My skin feels much better and I can finally feel in control. I hope this helps. ",
