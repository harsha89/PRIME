The floppy ends and knives don't really mix.   Floppy finger ends also get in the way with kneading and forming dough.  I used to be able to whip up a batch of scones in no time.  Now it seems to take me forever. Fran, you are a role model for making the best of a lousy situation!  I'm going to keep you in mind when I have one of my \"woe is me\" days.    I'm so sorry that the stupid Disability regulations required you to do that surgery which left you with an even bigger problem!  It sounds so Big Brothery.  Glad to hear you have such a supportive husband.  My husband has been great helping me, too. I don't know what I'd do without him.  Stay well! {{{Hugs}}} Alyjens",

You should definately call them.  Your garment should be covered if ordered when insurance was effective.  I was concerned with my out of pocket costs and the American Cancer Society sent me a letter of organizations that help with LE supplies and copays.  I don't know how much they would help but it's worth a try.  Maybe the ACS could give you some assistence with the insurance issue, too?  If you send me a private message, I'll email the list to you.  Also, most people don't know that if they receive services at a non-profit hospital, they may qualify for reduced out of pocket expense.  My hospital in PA, has a sliding scale depending on income and I was surprised how high the threshold was to qualify for the first discount level. I only found out about it a couple months ago and I used to work there until the bc!   It's worth looking into.  It really helped me handle the therapy costs. Good luck to you Thurs and prayers that you get your garments soon. Alyjens ",

Hope this helps some of you! Alyjens",

(bless him-he never complains. He really empathizes with what I've lost to limitations) I miss my crafts:  knitting, crocheting, beading.  I have LE in my dominant arm along with some mild neuropathy in my thumb and first 2 fingers.  Even reading is hard since holding a book for a length of time gets my arm aching along with the fingers.  And forget about a heavy hardback book!  Velcro has become my enemy.  It's everywhere and wrecks my expensive compression garments! I can't work full time anymore since I can't tolerate hours of the writing and computer keying my job requires, as well as filing and pulling heavy charts. (medical office).  I used to also have a part time job, too.  So the 45-50 hrs a week have shrunk to 20 along with my paycheck.  The out of pocket expenses for PT and garments compounds this. Jinky, driving bothers me, too, and I find that my ability to steer is \"weaker\". Jane,  I want to go to bed without being all wrapped up, too.  I've given up feeling \"sexy\" going to bed and my solution is to just stay up half the night. Kira, I totally agree with this being an \"orphan disease\" and the medical professionals don't have a good understanding of it and minimize it's effects on us.  I also agree that the LE doesn't let you put the bc behind you.  I could deal pretty well with the bc, treat it and get on with life.  The LE not so much.  You summed it up so well with your statement that \"My body swelled and my life shrunk\".  I am in mourning for my life before LE. Hugs to all of you! Alyjens",
