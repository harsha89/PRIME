You shouldn't feel worse before your next tx.  The fatigue does build up over the course of treatment, but I was able to work through mine, with days off for treatment and usually one other day (or working from home) for each tx. I have a desk job, though; I don't think I could have worked so much if it had been more physical. I had mouth problems that didn't kick in until the second treatment, and I think food tasted worse and worse as I went along, but generally my reactions were pretty even. Some people do have a fairly easy time of it, and I hope you're one of them.  But definitely drink, drink, drink, and keep up with the anti-nausea meds. Good luck! Max ",

What I did balk on was rads to the supraclavicular area (above the breast, collarbone, that area).  The rad onc said because I was high grade and triple negative, that was the \"standard\" treatment.  But I couldn't find any studies to support it, and she couldn't cite any.  So I went through 19 treatments, waking up and going to sleep fretting about possible damage to the thyroid and throat -- and finally told the rad onc, no more to that area.   I finished the 25 regular rads and 8 boosts.   Once the regular treatment ended, even before boosts were over, the rest of my skin had started to heal.  The boost area got worse before it got better, but it's been fine for about a week now.  I ended rads 8/27. ETA: Tender, I wish any of my docs had explained things as clearly as you do.  I've seen other posts from you and always learn something new.  I  had a BS who called me an \"information hound\".  I fired him and found one more willing to talk and explain.  The rad onc I never got through to.  Guess I ended up short in the supraclav area. ",

My LE therapist did some massage across my chest to encourage the flow that way, but what seemed to work best was massaging across my back.  It's different from regular massage because the lymph system is closer to the skin than the muscles are. You start at the opposite side of the back and do gentle pushes (think of trying to move your skin on the top of your muscles), working your way across to the affected side, but still pushing the other way.  As I understand it, what you're doing is clearing the other side so you can push the fluid from the affected area.   My husband has gotten very good at it!  Also, I can get a chair massage once a week at work, and the MT will do it for me as well.",

Mapping and the accuracy of the radiation have gotten better over time, so I think they mean they would expect fewer cardiac problems in women treated more recently. I wish they'd shown when the women with the heart disease were treated.",

I use one strip along my lumpectomy scar, and it helps keep it softer, and also a wider band on the lower side of that breast, kind of tucking up under the nipple.  That one gives me support and also lessens the hardening of the nipple area. I tried it across my chest above the breasts, but it didn't seem to make much difference and interfered with my MLD, so I stopped that one.  This week I've experimented with 2 strips down the inside of my affected forearm, and they seem to be helping with a sore spot there. I keep the tape on for about 4 days, then take a day off to give my skin a rest.  My LT says it doesn't work the same way for everyone, but it's certainly worth a try. Hope this helps. ",

My concern was lymphedema, because I'd had some swelling in my arm after the node surgery.  So I saw a lymphedema therapist for treatment and also got a compression sleeve to wear on the flight. I didn't have any problems.  If I'd traveled 2 weeks after radiation, my only concern would have been fatigue, because I was pretty low-energy for about 6 weeks after treatment.  Two weeks should also be enough time for your skin to heal if it needs to. I hope rads go smoothly for you and you have a wonderful vacation. ",
