I've tried very hard not to voice my fears to my husband, as not to worry him more when the likelyhood that both areas are benign is so high! But the thoughts certainly are swirling in my head and having a place to let them out alleviates some of my worry. I feel blessed to have found this community ❤️ Your advice makes sense. I had called my doctor as well as the women's center at the hospital to get my birad score after learning about those here. All I was told is it was a 4, primpting a biopsy. I asked if it was an a,b,c and was informed they don't classify? And that a 5 would mean I was diagnosed with BC. Now, that is contrary to everything I've read about birads. From what I've read, 5 would be \"highly suspicious\" meaning the likelyhood is 95% with biopsy needed to make final diagnoses. And a 6 would be already diagnosed. Anyhoo, I will call the office on Monday and request the actual report as you have advised. Just want to say for those other women who maybe reading this, the core biopsy was not too bad. I had read conflicting feedback on that lol and had made myself batty expecting a painful experience. I'm sure it differs a bit from one individual to another, but please rest easy in anticipation for that. I let the nurse know immediately that I require some extra \"juice\" when I have dental work done and the radiologist was as generous as possisble with the local anestesia! Little pressure and a very slight burning sensation when the actual punches happened, but not bad at all. Lastly, sending love and light to anyone who is in a space of worry and concern about what the future holds for them. Know that prayers are being sent up today for all those diagnosed or in the waiting period oxo Big Hugs from this lady in MA",

Does any of this sound like it should be watched or followed up more closely?

Decided to join today to pose a question. Here goes.. I had my core biopsy this morning. When I walked in the room my US was up on the screen and immediately had a sinking feeling at what a say. A dark, taller than wide (very tall actually and rather slim if you will) with a very irregular shape. This is I figured was the lump I had found that prompted me to see doc in the first place. Now to take you back a bit, doc sent me for mammo and was informaed right after radiologist wanted an US while I was there. Urging US tech asked me if I was aware of a different lump, which I was not. Couple days later. Doc called - I needed a biopsy for suspicious findings. Fast forward this morning when as I mentioned, walked in the room for biopsy and saw that image on the screen, which from all the reading I've been doing looked very suspicious of what could possibly be cancer. However, as I watched the US guided biopsy happen, I realized they were biopsying the lump that I didn't know was there and hadn't biopied (from what I could tell because the other \"oddly shaped, tall one\" didn't appear on screen) that larger, scarier one I had first presented with. my question (finally getting to that lol) is, is that normal?? Could it be that the radiologist could be so certain that that one was cancer that he bypassed the biopsy on it assuming it needed to be removed anyway? Just terribly confused and as you all know, scared overall. Any thoughts or shared experiences would be such a blessing in this anxiety filled time Log in to post a reply",
