Hi Girlstrong! Are you doing Hair, Skin and Nails?  About the extensions...I have thought about doing them too, I don't have any info, beyond that you should have 4\" of hair before you start.  I have been looking at the clip on ones in the beauty stores; if I buy a set you can bet I will be playing with them as soon as they stay in my hair.  The professionally installed ones seem so expense and time consuming that I'm not sure.  Please post what you find out.  Oh, and with Latisse, my MO won't write me a script because there's supposedly a lymphoma risk with it...I'm NOT trying to scare you, just a heads-up....of course, I'm on chemo so maybe when I'm done, if I need it, I will ask again. Donnabelle, LizA and Jumpy...keep on hanging in there, taking vitamins, scalp massaging, etc.  Your hair will come back! And, just repeating the invitation...Friend me on Facebook where I post my weekly hair progress.  PM me here and I'll add you to my list.   Yours, Michelle",

Rhody,  you're almost done with AC?  awesome!  I had low blood cell counts too..took Neopogen throughout Taxol.  So glad to be done! After the fill in my TE, one \"girl\" is higher/bigger than the other...I have named them: Ginger and Mary-Anne.  Guess which one is which? Happy Sunday everyone!",

I have my last chemo on Thurs, and on Sat night my dear friend is hosting us up in Napa overnight to celebrate!  I know there's still rads to go, but it was chemo that I dreaded the most...and now it's almost over.   Headeast, I will be thinking of you Fri when I wake up to a week (and hopefully, a lifetime) of no more chemo.  Best wishes on exchange!

Now, onto BC...yeah, that!...#10 Taxol today and rads consult in half an hour.  Moving right along.  Oh, and if any of you want to join me on FB, PM me and I'll add you to my list...I have weekly 'fuzz updates' there...chemo hair porn.  Irresistable, I know. ;)   Keep on keeping on, all my love, Michelle (Warrior70)",
