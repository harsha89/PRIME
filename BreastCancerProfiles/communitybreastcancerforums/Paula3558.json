The worst side effects that are bothering me now are insomnia. I tried benadryl which made my muscles jump all night (never had that effect from benadryl before) and tried over the counter sleep aid, that didn't help either. I am averaging 3 hrs sleep a night. Any suggestions. The nausea comes and goes even after taking zofran or compazine. The thought of curtain foods brings repulsive feeling and nausea.

The doctors and nurses told me that I was an inspiration to them, they actually added the use of claritan and extra strength tylenol to there protocol to help with the side effect of Neulasta bone pain based on my recommendation. The nurses have started recommending that patients go to breastcancer.org for support based on my praises, and I told them that the suggestions of claritain and many other great suggestions of how to better control SE's, hair loss, depression, relationships,etc...... the invaluable list goes on and on. Ladies we have actually become responsible for changing protocol at a Baltimore Cancer Center to others with the side effect of bone pain. Our discussion board does make a difference. I recommend taking the claritin and extra strength tylenol the morning of chemo, the day after (approx. 1 hr. before the Neulasta shot) and continue for five days. I still have mild bone pain usually three days after chemo, but only for 24 hrs. which is much better than before I tried the claritin. --- I just gave myself my LAST Neulasta shot!!! YEA!!!

Dealing with the SE of chemo and the emotional highs and lows have been hell, but without the understanding and support from everyone on this site it would be a lot more difficult. It hurts when family or close friends who we thought we could count on let us down.  Well meaning people (like my mom) want to make excuses for those type of people and say \"they just don't know what to say or how to act\" I feel this way, there two types of people in world, there are those that are cold, selfish and self centered and those that are warm, compassionate and sincere. I feel very sorry for people that are selfish and self centered because they don't have a clue of what really matters. That's one thing that this experience of dealing with cancer has given me and that's knowing what really matters. I appreciate life so much more and notice things that I was always too busy to pay attention to before.   Helen- congrats on your last chemo treatment.

Here's what has happening in our lives- Finished chemo 7/16, so happy to get it over with DH and I planned to spend the wkend of the 25th (9 days after chemo) at the shore to celebrate. I was even going to work on my chartwheels while we were there. The night before we were to leave my husband c/o numbness and tingling in his feet. I'm a nurse so I didn't want to fool around, especially with all the stress that he has been going through with my illness. By the time we got to the ER and he was seen by the physician the numbness had spread to above his knees. He was admitted with a diagnosis of Guillian Barre Syndrome. It's unknown what causes this syndrome, but usually occurs after being ill with a viral or bacterial infection. The doctors all wanted to know if he has sick recently. He has been pushing himself, and just overwhelmed and exhausted since my diagnosis. Guess we really didn't know how drained we both were until this happened. He was admitted and started treatment right away. This syndrome usually progresses rapidly and causes paralysis starting at the feet and works its way up to the head. It's concidered a medical emergency because it can also impair breathing which requires mechanical ventiation. When we got the dignosis I was a wreck, hysterical. Could not stop crying. All I could think was, Why?! What the hell have we done to deserve this. First cancer and now this. By the time the doctors had started the treatment the tingling and numbness had progress up to his hips. He was still able to walk. The medical team was preparing us for the worst. Then something wonderful happened, the numbness and tingling started to recede. He spent Five days in the hosp. getting IVGA. After six days the numbness in his legs was gone. The doctors are amazed. They believe that it was caught in the very early stages and treatment was started right away. I'm calling him my miracle man. We still have to keep an eye on any reoccurance of numbess ot tingling, and go right back to the ER if it returns within the next two weeks. So far so good. He is home, and I thank God for this miracle. So when we both get back to \"normal\" (whats normal?) we are both going to do chartwheels!!! - Paula   ",

My onc. was very blunt about my situation. Since I had invasive breast ca.(ER+/PR+) with lymphnode involvement it is crucial that I receive Al therapy. Without antihormone therapy my chance of survival is greatly decreased, and risk of reoccurance is increased by about 30%. Not what I wanted to hear. She said the SE of these drugs according to her other patients are flu like aches for approx. 24hrs after the Zometa infusion, which is every 4 wks. Zometa is used to decrease bone loss from the Al drug (Femera) and in a European study found that Zometa prevented bone mets. I have to have dental work completed before the study begins. Scheduled to have a crown placed on one of my molars (that I put off until after completing chemo) tomorrow. I signed up for the study and will try it, can always drop out if SE's are too bad. If SE's anything like chemo I will take my chances on Gods will. After the appt. with the oncologist I met my girlfriend for lunch. After lunch my friend had the great idea to get some wine coolers and find a nice spot along the river to sit and talk. We talked about everything, including the possiblity of two middle aged women being arrested for drinking alcohol in a public place (lol). Oh, well life is an adventure. I'm sure if we had been arrested our husbands would have bailed us out!!  ",

I had problems with fibercystic breasts and was always being called back after mammograms for every 3 month or 6 month follow up. So when cancer was discovered in my right breast I decided to have a bilateral masectomy with immediate TRAM flap recontruction. Yes, I got a boob job and a tummy tuck!! I did alot of research on the internet about the procedure, and looked at before and after pictures. The pictures I saw were not pretty. So I didn't expect to look like a playboy bunny! I just wanted to use my own tissue, for me it helped me feel more normal having breasts made from my own muscle. The plastic surgeon was excelllent. My results are alot better than what I saw on the internet. If you decide that's what you want I can give you her name since we're both in Balto. My surgery was 2/23/09. I'm very happy with my decision and the results.    Thanks for the \"mow the lawn\" youtube. I enjoyed it. We all need to laugh. Paula  ",

My oncologist thinks that it may have been caused by the taxotere. Not sure if she is going to lower the dose or cut it out of my cocktail of TAC all together. My 3rd chemo treatment out of 6 was 5/14, and was hoping it would be alot smoother than the 2nd since I got shingles after the 2nd dose. After the 3rd dose I felt extremely tired and experienced minimal bone pain, since prior treatments included SE of severe bone pain. Thought I was out of the woods and sailed through 3rd without too many SE until a week and two days after my treatment when I felt constipated and gassy (is that a word? lol). I didn't think much of it and just took senna and colase for the constipation. The next day I felt as if I was being stabbed in the left lower abdomin and went to the ER. IV Cipro and Flagyl for 5 days. Still on Cipro and Flagyl by mouth at home. Next chemo due 6/4. I hope this doesn't postpone my treatment, won't know until Thursday when I see the oncologist again. The SE have been hell, but having this site has made all the difference. When I feel like I'm going through this and no one close to me understands how hard it is, I read what everyone else is going through and the suggestions from everyone really help to feel that I'm not going through this alone. To my Maryland friends: Have you heard of the Hopewell House? It's a cancer support center off of Falls Rd. My chemo nurse gave me inform. and I went to an introduction session before I ended up in the hospital and was planning on going to a yoga and meditation class there. They also have breast cancer support groups. All the groups and activities are free of charge. www.hopewellcancersupport.org  ",

I recently found out that a nursing tech. that works at my hospital lost her home and most of her belongings to a fire. She has three children and they are now living with different relatives until they can relocate. It was an electrical fire, the insurance is supposed to pay for relocation expenses, but so far has not. To say the least she is not in the Christmas spirit and is living from one day to the next to get by. My small act of kindness was to find her while she was working and give her a Christmas card with $50 in it. I wrote a note of encouragement and friendship. Before she even opened the card she was crying and thanking me. She had me in tears. I know it wasn't alot of money but the small acts of kindness go along way. We may have started a new \"Pay it Forward\" movement in Lena's honor. Merry Christmas everyone!!!     ",

I'm a  nurse and approx. five yrs ago,  worked in an infusion center with oncology patients and felt that because I had the experience I wouldn't have a problem getting through this experience. Boy was I wrong. I knew what most of the side effect were going to be, but the bone pain after the Nulasta shot and insomnia took me by surprise and had me worried. I felt much better by Thur. ( a full week after tx) and was able to thick about solid food without gaging. Went to my daughter's on Friday (4/10) for dinner and actualy enjoyed the meal. It was a great wkend amost felt back to normal. I too had hair down to shoulders and cut it very short in preparation for having my head shaved. I got it shaved yesterday. My daughter and mom went with me. I became very emotional and cried. Wore my wig out in public today. I was very self concious, but no one seemed to even notice. I am getting more comfortable. I know it's only hair and it will grow back. What's important is that we remain strong support one another and get through this cancer free!!!  ",

I've been separated from my husband for a year and we are going ahead with the divorce. I initiated the divorce- the last straw was on my one year cancer dx. anniversary. I showed him the date on the calender and made the statement, that it was my one year anniversary, his reply was - That he didn't\" give a \"f**k\" get over it and move on!!\". I felt like I had been slapped in the face and kicked in the stomache at that moment. On the outside we were the perfect couple - people couldn't believe that we were separating. His explaination was that I couldn't handle the stress of the cancer treatments and went over the edge. Of course my closest friends and family know differently and have encouraged me to end the marrige for my own health and sanity. - It's been very difficult. Joining a yoga class at the Cancer center has helped give me peace. I am now \"single\" and do not feel confident in myself to \"date\" feels very strange. I don't mention that I am a breast cancer survivor, I think for fear of feeling like damaged goods. That's the best way to describe the way my \"ex\" made me feel. Don't get me wrong I am Proud to be a survivor, and I don't hesitate sharing my experience with other women that know someone or themselves have been affected by breastcancer.

Told my oncologist on top of everything else I felt like I'm going crazy, on an emotional roller coster. When I was diagnosed I started Zoloft (anti-depressant) 50mg, my oncologist increased it to 100mg til I get through this crap. I still feel like my DH was insensitive. Also started on Valtrex 1 gm three times a day for the shingles. --- I keep telling myself we will get through this.

Lena- You are not alone as you can see from the other postings, and I can also agree. It does us no good to focus on the negative, we need hope and that is what this site gives me. A place that I can vent or just know that everyone here understands what we're going through. There have been times that I have lost it (threw something at the wall, broke it and also put a hole in the wall) Did I feel better? Yea, I did for a moment then realized that now I had to fix the wall. It's funny because I'm in a place now that I am so angry or more hurt because some of the people that I thought that I could count on have really disappointed me. And there are others that have been wonderful. The one person that upsets me is my step-daughter. I thought that we had a close relationship. Two days before my 10hr. surgery, my step-daughter, her husband and my 13 yr old step granddaughter took my husband and I out to dinner. I felt invisable as I sat at the table while the conversation went from sports to current events and everything execpt me. Sounds self centered? That's what I thought after thinking about how I felt at the time. I was nervous and terrified of the up coming surgery as well as the new dx. of cancer and all my fears that I didn't know how to deal with. And everyone acted like nothing was wrong  and everything was fine. I wanted to cry or scream. Instead I just smiled and went along with the meaningless conversation. My step grand-daugther asked me to come with her to the gift shop in the restaurant. I thought that she had seen something that she wanted. Instead she was smiling and so proud of herself that she had found a rack of pins, bracletts whatever you can think of they had it devoted just for breast cancer awareness. I lost it!!! I started sobbing and I couldn't stop. I scared Erin, she thought that she had did something to upset me. I was so upset with my re-action because it upset and scared my grand-daughter. Then I got angry, but didn't say anything. How stupid of my step daughter to let a 13 yr old be set up like that. But then again no one really understands how we feel inside. Just recently, the same step- daughter, knowing that myself, her dad, and her sister and also my daughter were walking in Relay for Life to honor my fight with cancer, did not donate a cent towards the cause. She has never given any words of encouragement, she just avoids the whole issue. She did tell me she got me a t-shirt that says \"fight like a girl\". I want to tell her to stick the t-shirt. But then again like  putting a whole in the wall. Lashing out may feel good for the moment, but would only make things ulgy, and in the end would be more of a hassle trying to fix the relationship afterwards. So I won't say anything. I just feel sorry for her because she doesn't understand and is clueless. And feeling angry doesn't do me any good, uses up too much energy that I need now to get through this. Now that I have rambled on and on, I guess I just want to say that even though I go through times that I want to scream or am feeling very down, I need to hang on to hope and remain positive.  I also am bald, have lost most of my eye lashes and have had reconstruction surgery, but have no nipples and have a scar from hip to hip (from the tram flap procedure). I don't want my husband to even look at my body right now. He tells me I'm beautiful to him. I feel like he's just saying that, because there is no way that feel anywhere close to beautiful or even like a woman. Hopefully after the treatments are over and our energy returns so will our self esteem and sex drive.           ",

I believe this treatment knocked me on my butt because I didn't hydrate enough before the chemo treatment. I usually drink de-caffinated liquids two to three days before treatment and have felt pretty good the day of chemo. Usually the side effects of feeling out of it and achy didn't start until the second day after my TAC treatment. This time I went to the zoo with my grandkids the day before treatment. I felt great the weather was beautiful and warm. Didn't really think about it, but was drinking iced green tea (caffinated). I think that is what made all the difference in how I felt. Lesson learned don't over do it the day before treatment and hydrate. I had a great time with my grandkids and enjoyed every minute of our day together. I have one more chemo treatment to go. Last dose of TAC is July 16th. Thank God. My Oncologist wants me to start a cancer study for three years with iv Zometa (once a month) to decrease the risk of reoccurence and bone loss. Anyone else familiar with this study. I need to do research on the side effects of this to see if it's worth it. I'm so tired of feeling like crap.   ",

The SE from the last treatment knocked me on my butt for about seven days. Hopefully it won't be as bad this time around. Had my head shaved last monday, haven't noticed any bald spots yet. I have noticed that the hair on my legs is not growing back as fast. Wouldn't it be nice if the hair on our legs and under our arms never comes back! Good luck everyone having their 2nd treatment, let's hope it gets easier.       ",

I'm also taking chocolate, since I'm a chocolate addict and will eat half a box of chocolate if given the chance NO will power when comes to chocolate. My thought was if I eat chocolate I won't want it ever again after chemo! (lol)",

Bilat. masectomy with TRAM flap reconstruction. Had tons of support from friends and family. Don't get me wrong I still have support, but not like it was when the diagnosis was new. Sailed through the surgical recovery. And now I'm afraid to go back to work, in case I can't handle the side effects. I'm afraid that once I'm off of disablity then I will have to work, and I'm afraid of not being able to manage and the risk of infection. So the financial aspect is weighing on my mind as well. My husband says don't worry about it. I have been the primary income. I'm an RN and the risk of infection scares the hell out of me. Any words of advise? ",

Alaina, my husband already read the Breast Cancer book for Husbands. He did apologise yesterday for being insensitive. Said he didn't want to argue. He's glad I took it out on the clown instead of him. DH gave me a hug and said that one day we will laugh about the poor clown.   ",

I would like to stay together as we continue on with the next step of our journeys. We have supported one another through chemo and I feel that we have formed a bond that hopefully we can continue. Thank you for all the support. There were a few times that I wanted to quit chemo, and I hung in there because I felt we were in this battle together. When I felt that friends and family didn't understand, I knew I could come to this discussion board to find \"friends\" that were going through the same thing that would share an understanding that others who are not going through this journey couldn't. Thank you again. Hopefully I will get through this last treatment with minimal side effects. I have noticed very fine fuzz on my head. Yea!!!!      ",
