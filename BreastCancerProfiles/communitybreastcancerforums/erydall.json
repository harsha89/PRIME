    "Content": "Aug 25, 2013 10:53PM - edited Aug 25, 2013 10:54PM by erydall I had a lumpectomy seven days ago and after just few days I asked my doctor if I could play tennis!!!  He said no, so I asked, \"Ping-pong?\" and he said no so I tried for \"Darts?\"  Negative.  It was numb and didn't feel that painful.  However, today it is very sore and I am sad about it feeling worse instead of better.  I am getting lots of sleep and rest and just doing a few errands each day--not even close to my normal work load.  One of my biggest concerns is the numbness in my hands and arms from the sentinal node surgery.  I am a muralist and I worry about not getting feeling back.  It is very awkward to type.  Any insights?",
