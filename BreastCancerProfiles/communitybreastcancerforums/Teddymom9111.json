Last week I had my MRI and they found a 3.2 cm non mass enhancement and another one1.2cm nearby. Dr thinks this is fibrocystic tissue but still wants a biopsy. How could something stable grow all of a sudden? Is 3.2 big? Can DCIS be that large andstill contained in the duct? She said DCIS was the next highest likelihood. I have had pain at the sites for the last 2 months and very very worried. Anyone had a non mass enhancement turn out to be fibrocystic tissue? How do I get through this waiting Log in to post a reply",
