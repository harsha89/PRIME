All results from US were within normal parameters. Contacted our local Cansa branch who referred me to a breast clinic and I contacted them.  They were wonderful and one of the Oncologists phoned me back and advised I find a surgeon and go for a second opinion.  Well the surgeon I went to was very good, he wasnt too worried about the dimple/indent but then he checked my breasts and found a lump near to the dimple/indent and also a thickening in my other breast.  Neither were picked up by the US.  The surgeon then recommended an MRI as he said \"I dont want to ask you to come back in 6  months incase there is cancer because then we would have lost 6 months of treatment\".  Such a nice caring attitude.  I have a follow up appt on Thursday at 11h45.  From reading up on the internet that a dimple/indent and a lump combined are not good news however, if it is cancer I will fight it head on - it is not curable but at least it is treatable!

I noticed a dimpling on my breast have had mammo done [normal] ultrasound done [normal] so went off to my gynae - she told me everything was normal.... but still the gut feel is that there is something not right.  Made an appt with a surgeon for a 2nd opinion, he did a manual checkup and found a huge area of thickening on one breast and a lump on the other.   I am booked in for an mri tomorrow - he just said that he is not going to send me away for 6 months only to find that we could have treated the problem now. You will probably have to shop around to find a sympathetic surgeon but honestly there is so much hype about breast cancer being on the increase - you would expect your dr to listen to you.  As no one knows their bodies better than you do.  Holding thumbs for you.
