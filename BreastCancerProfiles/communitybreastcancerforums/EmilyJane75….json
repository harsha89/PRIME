I've had 8/28 radiation treatments so far and my skin still looks normal (as expected for early on). I have definitely been feeling fatigued though - having cheerios for dinner and going to bed early kind of tired. Little nervous to see how the side effects - particularly the fatigue progresses. ",

I'm lucky it's not too bad and they prescribed me an antiviral medication that can help keep it from getting too bad. Wanted to describe how it came on just incase you ladies start to feel it you won't get as worried as I did - my skin felt painful a few days before the rash appeared. There was no bruise or visible sign of irritation -- until the rash appeared a few days later. The rash at this point looks somewhat like poison ivy. Other than the shingles, I am on my 4th/6 week of radiation and doing pretty well so far. Take care ladies!",

So, my last day of radiation is tomorrow - yeah! However today my RO called me and said 'oops they should have scheduled you for 7 boosts instead of 5'. So, I went in for an additional treatment today and will go twice again tomorrow. Finishing with a bang I'd say. I'm a little over 2 months out of chemo and I finally stopped wearing a scarf around last weekend. Just got sick of wearing them and figured the scarf was as equally shocking as my super short hair. I find it interesting how people receive me differently with this look though - some people smile when I smile but some people are like 'what the...?' I'm not sure that post-chemo is the first thing coming to mind for them.",
