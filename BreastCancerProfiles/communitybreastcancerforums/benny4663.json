Mine are 7 and 9 and as I am still in diagnostic phase I haven't felt the need to tell them. They know I have had 2 surgeries and prior to that I had a sore lump in my breast. When my 7 year old asked me why I was going in again (I have a 3rd surgery scheduled) I said exactly what BEVIN has said ... something like I had something that was making me feel bad in my breast and they are getting it all out so it won't hurt anymore. Until I am at the stage where I am going to radiation or mastectomy I have chosen not to use the word cancer around them. They are too young to grasp that concept.  I know what you are going through, I just want a final diagosis so I know what my options are and I can feel secure that it is not anywhere else. This is the worst part ... all the testing. So far it's been 4 months since the initial finding on my mammogram. I had to wait so long to even see the surgeon to do the first biopsy as they didn't feel it was anything to be concerned about (I had a large fibroadenoma which was growing and that's all they thought they were dealing with before they discovered DCIS adjacent to it). Hugs and good thoughts to you.",

Right now we are looking at DCIS in right breast, so far about 2 cm but I do not have clear margins so there could be more. At this point there is no \"definitive sign of invasion\" but they are also recommending doing the sentinal lymph biopsy just to be sure.  I am fine with the surgery but terrified of the MRI as I am claustrophobic and there is no way I can lie in an enclosed \"tomb.\" What is the procedure exactly? Is it completely enclosed? How long does it take? Can I be sedated? Someone told me there is a 'panic button' is this true? I am in Canada (Vancouver, BC) so I don't know if the technology here is different than in the States or other parts of the worls. Any information, advice would be appreciated.

I think I can handle it if I'm looking down at the floor (like the massage table reference but I will definitley need some relaxants). Unfortunately I have already had 2 lumpectamys, original one was just to remove simple fibroadenoma and then DCIS was discovered adjacent to it. Went in to get more tissue and again no clear margins so here we go again. I understand the MRI will be hard to read as my surgery won't have completely healed when we do it but at least I'll know if there's any in the other breast. I also will be doing the sentinal lymph node biopsy which I assume will be done after MRI. So many unknowns and my surgeon keeps going on holidays. Hopefully she`s used her vacation time for the year! LOU10 - was yours done at the Cancer Agency in Vancouver?",

I would assume this would be first choice as my surgeon is across the street so would make sense. Both my biopsies were done there. I agree about the body before head thing and being able to see would make a big difference.",
