Well they just do not know how hard it is, you want to get on with it but you get tired by mid day, since I have neuropathy in my feet,as you know,hurt,  you can only walk so fast and so far. I do not sleep well because my boob still hurts, only good thing is I dont have bad hair days yet. Please  do not get me wrong I am very blessed with the result of chemo,surgery and radiation. I just want it the way it was but I think I have to find a new normal. God Bless( I also go to MDA they are great there)",
