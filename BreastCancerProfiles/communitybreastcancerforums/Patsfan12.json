I finished up my first go around with chemo a few weeks ago (THP) and still have 4 cycles of AC waiting for me after surgery, but for the moment, I'm just hoping I won't be too much of a baby with the pain!! Also, any advice you guys could offer about the procedure where they inject the dye would be great, that piece makes me kind of nervous too. Thanks in advance for any feedback you can offer!!",
