      "Content": "Troglodyfae wrote: Hi  Sorry if this is in the wrong section but I was fairly uncertain where I should post this question.  I had a routine mammogram at the beginning of November of last year, and was called back very quickly for a needle biopsy because they had found an area of some concern on my right breast, albeit not a large area.  Ten days after having the needle biopsy I was called back again for a vacuum biopsy.  They were going to take 12 samples but ended up taking 18, so my breast was black with bruising.  Thankfully my test result showed that they had removed everything of concern. so that is brilliant news, I have a titanium marker in my breast now to show where they have been. I am however concerned that my breast is still quite bruised and I have noticable tissue loss and a very large hard, painful lump where the biopsy was performed.  Is this normal?  I would have thought that it would have healed by now, but I am a little reticent to go to my family doctor as I do not want to make a fuss over something that is normal.  Having not been through this proceedure before it is difficult to know what is and what is not normal. I wondered if any of you ladies who might have been through this could give me some answers. Thanks in advance Log in to post a reply",
