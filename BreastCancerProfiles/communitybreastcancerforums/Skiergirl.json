Before my surgery I purchased two lovely new pillows and a \"wedge\" cushion so I could be propped up nicely. My husband (who is very handy) also put a switch on the cord of my bedside lamp, and looped it over my bed post so I could reach it.  This was really helpful!   I wished I had a back scratcher!  Chapstick was also a must-have, along with a notepad to write down my meds and when I took them. I also had a water cup with a twist-off top and straw - never worried about spilling! These things may seem insignificant, but helped me and maybe could help others Stay strong and know that you can do this.  I needed lots of help with this.   I told everyone how afraid I was.  Some think that if you don't say anything that everything is ok. Ask for help and lean on those who love you.",
