    "Content": "G696 wrote: I had a stereotactic core biopsy, left breast and report came back as DCIS, Intermediate and High grades, Solid and Comedo Types, with Microcalifications. DCIS is present in two tissue fragments, each measuring up to 5mm. in greatest dimension. The specimen consists of multiple cores of fibrofatty tissue measuring 3 mm, in dia, and up to 1.5 cm in length. TE-2. Radiologist said I need surgery and 6 weeks radiation. Would like any advice from forum members of who to see? Surgeon, Radiation Oncologist or other? What does TE-2 in report mean? Seven years ago I had low grade LCIS in the other breast and had a surgical excision. I am located in Bergen County NJ near NYC. I am 58 years old and in very good health. Log in to post a reply",
