    "Content": "Nina211 wrote: I'm probably over-reacting but... two years ago I had a mammogram that required I return for spot compression--they had a dense area on the left breast that was hard for them to read. Everything came back normal then. I forgot to get a mammogram (I know, bad) again until 2 years later. I returned to the same place, and got the call again to come back for another spot compression in the same left breast--only this time, there were two areas of density. No ultrasound, it's classified as additional imaging, not diagnostic or anything like that. I am freaking out because I waited two years, it's in the same area (couldn't they rule it out based on previous films?) and I'm now peri-menopausal and my breasts are just weird overall. They get sore and I'm now worried that perhaps my left breast is actually *more* sore than the other, etc., etc. Because it's not a diagnostic mammogram request, I can't get in for the follow-up spot compression for 6 weeks! Eeek! Should I be worried that the same area showed up again? Or should I figure that if it looked at all suspicious they would have requested a diagnostic mammogram, rather than \"just\" spot compression re-imaging? Is it normal to continue to have spot compressions in the same area? Oh, my mom is a bc survivor (20+ years!), and my sister says she's been called back more than once on a mammogram as well.
