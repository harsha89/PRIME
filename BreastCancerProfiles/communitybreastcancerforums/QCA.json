I'll continue to post here and let you all know how the healing process goes, and help anywhere I can.  I'm anxious to see how long it takes for everything to look normal again, if it ever does. I know the redness will get better, but hope the strange coloring of the nipple will improve--right now it's sort of a bluish tan--dye+radiation effects.  And there's also a very pronounced circle where the boosts went.  We shall see what happens.  Right now I'm just glad I don't have to be somewhere at 9:00 AM every day!

Everyone has said no chemo, except the medical oncologist.  I'll get this info in my profile soon, but the tumor was ILC 2.5 cm, clear nodes (0/3), ER+, PR+, and HER2/neu \"not amplified\" (not sure what the last means.  Anyone know?)   I'm awaiting the results of the oncotype test now so that will influence my decision, but I'm praying for a low score to make the decision easier.   The main reason I don't want chemotherapy is my sister. She had BC a couple of years ago, had mastectomy with no problems, and then had one chemo treatment (TAC) and a week later was in the hospital near death.  She remained hospitalized for about 5 months, during which time various complications led to her leg being amputated. (Long story, but I think more related to some issues with her treatment with lack on oxygen in her legs that caused this).  Truly, my sister has a long history of drug allergies and that may also have contributed, but the result was the loss of her leg, and half of the other foot as well.  So, chemo terrifies me with good reason.   She's doing quite well now and adjusting to her prostheses. Of course, I've told all my doctors about my sister and they all say they've never heard of such a thing.  Well, I hadn't either; nobody has, but that's what happened and that's why I'm so scared.  The onc says she had a very aggressive treatment and I would be on TC, not TAC, but I just don't know.  It's all I think about now. My husband and children (DD age 28 and DS age 24) have been wonderful and I could not ask for more support.  My friends also have rallied and I cannot believe the number of women at church who've shared their own BC stories with me, some I knew about and some I did not. The radiologist who did my original biopsy suggested this site to me and I've been lurking here since I was diagnosed, reading almost everything here.  I already feel like I know many of you and I thank you all so very much for being here to share and to help.  I'm so sorry we all have to be here, though.

In fact, she had taken special training in the procedure.  About 2 hours before my scheduled surgery I was told that more \"pictures\" were needed and I was wheeled to radiology and into the mammography center.  At that point I wasn't alarmed because what I'd been told sounded reasonable, and they positioned me as if for more images.  I was approached from behind by a radiologist (not the one who had done my original biopsy) and was told he was going to insert a wire to mark the tumor for the surgeon.  I protested as much as I could (having already had a xanax) but the wire was inserted, backed up, and reinserted (this because I moved!).  I told them that my surgeon had said I would be under anesthesia for this procedure and they said \"oh no, you can't be under anesthesia for this\", and one of the techs sat in front of me and let me hold her hands.  I was absolutely in tears and sobbing as he injected the dye into my nipple 4 separate times.  Afterwards I was wheeled into a dressing room and left alone until someone came to wheel me back to the room. My surgeon had been told of this mistake and was absolutely livid when I got back. I told her that I'd tried to tell them but they wouldn't listen to me.  I was literally held captive by the breast, immobilized in the mammogram machine, it wasn't like I could get up and walk away!   After the surgery was over and I got dressed, the imaging director of the hospital and a patient advocate arrived in my room bearing a plant and profuse apologies, and a couple of days later I received a letter of apology from the imaging director, assuring me that this would never happen again.   That's all well and good and I'm glad that other women may not have to go through what I did, but as my surgeon said, the problem was that they didn't listen to the patient, and in this case, the patient was right. Even with having to go back for a re-excision  due to one unclear margin, I will always maintain that this was the worst thing I experienced.  Get that numbing patch, and better yet, be under anesthesia for this procedure!",

Sheila, for inviting me to join this group even though I'm stage 2.  Actually by breast surgeon said she'd probably classify me as stage 1b, so I think I fit.  I have ILC and had a lumpectomy 8-18 with re-excision 9-1.  The tumor nodule was 1 cm but with the \"tendrils\" maximum length was 2.5 cm.  Prior to the actual surgery I'd been told it was .6 cm, so go figure.  Anyhow, I'm 60 years old and retired early 2 years ago to do all I could for my father, who was nearly blind from macular degeneration and insisted on living at home.  My husband and I finally persuaded him to go into assisted living in January of 2009, where he soon fell and broke his hip, never to walk again. He passed away in January of this year, but I still look after my aunt who's in assisted living and is 98 years old.  Yes, 98! We have 2 adult children and are grandparents of a 16 month old boy, who we keep full time on weekdays while his parents work.  So, we've been and continue to be busy.  I honestly don't know how I found time to work now, and in view of the bc diagnosis, I'm glad to be busy! Like Jodimaca, I'm wrestling with the chemo decision.  I was stunned when my oncologist, who I've seen twice, suggested it.  I posted on the chemotherapy forum asking if it could be postponed and got several replies.  Now I'm waiting for the oncotype test results, which were supposed to be in Friday and weren't, so now the onc is to call me Monday.  I just don't know. I will willingly have radiation and take whatever is prescribed for 5 years, etc, but due to complications with my sister (who also had bc) I'm really frightened of chemo. Hopefully I'll know Monday, at least enough to make a decision. I've read this entire section and know I'm joining a wonderful group of women!  And, YAY for grannydukes!",
