My surgeon has mentioned a method of surgery using a harmonica scalpel as I am terrified of having a drain which could get infected and I belive this procedure can avoid a drain.  Has anyone had a procedure using this on node removal. I'm being treated for a breast cancer but there is no detectable cancer in the breast after all my scans and tests - only an uptake of disease in small nodes under right arm (according to my PET scan). Am still being diagnosed as cancer of unknown primary but both surgeon and ONC think it points to the breast even though it may be very microscopic. Log in to post a reply",

I have exactly the same diagnosis as you but my enlarged node ONLY showed up on a routine mamo as it was so deep so thank goodness I had that checked.Had all my nodes out (36) under arm and 6 had cancerous cells but after every scan imaginable there was no evidence of cancer other than in the nodes. I*;ve had 11 cycles of chemo, with scalp cooling, which worked (thankfully) and 25 days radiation to right breast which is still 2 cup sizes bigger now!! Got multiple pulmonary emboli due to chemo (Blood clots on lungs) which wasn't great so now Im on Warfarin......Now, im on Herceptin for a year. As far as Im; concerned, my nodes did exactly what they should be doing. i.e. the floating cells from my breast regressed to the nodes and got stuck there. They have now all been removed, my body has had a chemo wash out and cancer is destroyed........",

The node has cancerous cells but they dont know from where. All scans were clear apart from some disease in small nodes under right arm. I'm having more nodes removed shortly. I am also HER2+ which points to breast cancer so will discuss treatment options with ONC after surgery.They know it's definintely not lymphoma.I don't feel ill at all (apart from the stress and worry of cancer) and don't understand what is happening. I am hoping the cancer is so small, it is picked up early OR that my lymph system did it's job and got rid of it but then the cells stuck in the node.I'ts all very odd but at the same time I am so relieved that the scans didn't pick up cancer elsewhere so I do know what you are going through.I don't know how many cases of occult cancer there are yearly but I think it's quite rare.I am just wondering whether it has anything to do with my blood group as I'm rhesus negative and will do some research between this blood group and HER2/occult cancer.",

I had a fine needle biopsy, which showed cancerous cells, then ultrasound, MRI of breasts, CT scan AND CT-PET scan and on all tests, my breast and my other organs came back clear so diagnosis is cancer of unknown origin which is even harder to deal with as they can't kill it if they don't know where it's coming from.There are cancerous cells in the node which has now been surgically removed and I have so say that the op itself was not too bad - had no pain relief after op and scar not very big.On the PET scan, it did some some uptake in the right arm nodes so now the surgeon wants to take out nodes from the right and send over for testing. This is a bigger op and i am scared I can't use my arm to its full extend.  I play tennis (or did) and am always luggin heavy shopping around.THey also said that I was HER-2+, so both ONC and Specialist believe it points to a breast cancer that cannot be found (i.e it could be very microscopic). Not really sure what HER2 is but it doesn't sound good. I want to have my HER2 assessment redone as a second opionion and have to decide whether to have all the nodes removed or wait and see what happens.  Be interesting to hear if there is anyone else like me out there. i.e. cancer in node (s) but not in breast (and it's not lymphona, sarcoma or melanoma).",
