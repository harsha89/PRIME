Will be happy when Saturday comes and I take my last Levaquin.   Now to get ready for the hair loss.  Have wigs, scarves and hats!  Hopefully when I have to have my head shaved, my wonderful friends will go with me and we can have a party, just like our wig party and my first TX!   sally ",

Said it really looked real, some even said maybe the wig thing is the way to go!  I do think it takes time to get use wearing one.  To me I have the haircut I have always wanted.  My friend who just finished treatment and has hair came without  her wig today and her new hair is darling!! all in all still feeling fine today, am trying not to take the nausea pills, but let the ones in the infusion do their job. Do try to eat small meals or snacks over the day. Was happy with theI  Fritos and OJ!!   hadn't gained any weight, had even lost a pound.  Probably would have lost more except for those  So far really no headache!  Water tastes okay, need to have some more!  Only took Milk of Magnesium yesterday  and all seemed fine today, so that is what I will try this time. No cramping like when I took the Senekot. For the ones who take Claritin did  you take one before your shot,  Last time it didn't bother me, but we will see this time.  sally ",

My worst side effect is taste and it bothers me a lot. I know in a week it will be gone, I want my OJ to taste good again! The nuestra shot doesn't seem to bother me that much... motrin helps.  My WBC have been 7.9 each time.  I joked with her yesterday when I got the shot.. for the cost, it shouldn't give us pain!!  Guess I will thank my mom for making me drink all that milk when I was younger.   The doctor also told me  I could eat fresh fruit.  That made me happy as it has been hard to pass up those fresh strawberrries and grapes in the grocery store.. Looking forward to them tasting good next week!!!  Today has been rough, I let time go by while getting taxes ready for the accountant, that I should have taken a nausea pill earlier but hopefully it will kick in soon.  Made some home made macaroni and cheese in crock pot.  It was nice and bland, but then it was probably my taste buds Have been knitting some hats, hopefully will get another one done this weekend.  Signed up for the Look Good, feel Better program in April. Also need to call about Radiation, as they called the other day about when I would be starting. Guess around the first of April,  since my last chemo will be March 11th I did ask him why 4 instead of the six and he said it hasn't been proved that 6 is really better than four and with my report 4 would be fine. I didn't argue.    Enjoy your weekend sally ",

Guess that is why I see the doctor each visit.   So far not really any reactions from my shot, I had my 2nd treatment on Wed and feel I am turning the corner and feeling better.   Today I started my antibiotics for 7 days?  I take 500 MG of levaquin for 7 days.

The doctor was surprised that it did as he said most times it lasts the whole time.  IT was then that my tongue lost that white coating. I had been using something from my dentist ,but switched to Biotine and maybe that helped.  Also got the Biotine toothpaste.  Getting taste buds back was a thrill, maybe too good, as I ate two bags of Fritos, which I am sure raised my BP some,  The one thing that I was thrilled about was being able to drink OJ again.   Yesterday was second treatment of T/C.  Had a nice visit with the dr. Said he was glad I was doing the chemo since I am Triple NEg, even with my small tumor, no node involvement and clear margins he felt it was a very wise move. I said the decision was easy, and besides I plan on bugging him and my surgeon for a very long time! He just smiled and agreed. Infusion went well, the nurse found the vein without any problem, so I want him next time too.  The only glitch was my liever enzymes were a little elevated, but the doctor felt it was from the chemo so all was well  So far no headache like last time, but I really felt it was sinus pressure.  Nausea has been very slight.  Today is the shot, asked him about taking Claraitn said he had done research on it and really couldn't say if it worked or not, but said try it. The last time, I really didn't have any pain from the shot, but will give it a try.  Wore my wig, or now known as the perfect hair! I have never had perfect hair, so it seems strange walking around with \"perfect hair\", although it does blow in the wind. It it the perfect bob that I always wanted.  I too took control and shaved my head the day before the second tx. It was falling out in clumps and knew it was time.  The  lady who did it was so sweet.  IT was her first time to do a BC patient.  She said it was her gift to me. She liked my wig and we decided the color was perfect so when my new perfect hair comes in, that will be color.  Wishing each of you a great day!  hugs sally",
