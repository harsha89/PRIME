      "Content": "May 21, 2010 08:07AM hymil wrote: Hi KT and welcome. From what you have said, her tumour is too big to remove at the moment even with a mastectomy, and the idea of the hormones before surgery is to get that smaller. A smaller lump will be easier to take out, and has a better chance to get clear margins, since it's the risk of secondaries you really need to be thinking about. Also potential surgical problems like blood loss should be less, and if they are also dissecting the armpit for lymph-nodes that is much easier with a smaller lump. They might not need to do this, depending on the staging investigations, which would be great. I had the same thing, hormones before surgery, because my lump was large too, 6cm. The surgeon wanted to try for just a lumpectomy, but it didn't shrink enough, (still 6cm after 4 months tamoxifen) so I ended up with mastectomy anyway. Under a microscope afterwards they said you could tell the drug was working by how the cells looked, so I know the risk of spread has been reduced, and it also had given me time to get used to the idea and investigate the options. Actually it was more that the surgeons were trying to do breast-conserving because i'm under 50, i was like just Get-it-off-of-me-NOW !! They might be wanting extra time to get your grandma ready for surgery in other ways eg improve cardiac or lung-function, maybe build her up a bit. She will probably get the hormones after surgery as well, this seems to be fairly standard for Eostrogen-responding tumours. Especially as for her, the option for radiation has been used up already. Hope it all goes well for her, good luck!",

What that does is tells the oncologists the best way to treat. So for ER+ tumours they use treatments that reduce the circulatiung oestrogen or block it from catching onto those receptors: Tamoxifen, aromatase are common ways to do this or removal of ovaries. Staging is made up of a combination of tumour size, whether it has spread to nodes, local structures like muscles or further afield like your liver/lungs/brain, but tells you little about the agressiveness of the tumour. Stage 0 is DCIS or LCIS in-situ pre-cancer, very early stage with high success rates, stage IV or 4 is advanced and bad. Grade on the other hand tells you how aggressive the tumour is, are the cells very wierd or only just a little bit odd: nearly normal cells make a grade 1 tumour, not very aggressive wherease grade 3 is faster growing, more out of control and the cells look very different than normal. Grade 1 is good. You might also hear about an \"Oncotype DX\" score, that is a test done on biopsy, and is similar to the grade and helps the oncologist decide whether chemo will help for your particular cancer., you can get high medium or low scores (low is good) Hope that helps you. It sounds like they are doing thorough investigations and getting things moving, so I hope you will find out more soon. It's easy to focus on getting the primary tumour out, but that might not be the whole story so time spent doing the extra checks is not time wasted. I spent four months before surgery being treated systemically whole body with tamoxifen (Im ER+) so if any cells had gotten away in my bloodstream whatever, they were also being mopped up, it drove me nuts waiting at the time, but in hindsight it was a good call.",

I totally agree, get them checked out and get some counselling too - a girl your age should be able to proud of them and enjoy them. While you were there for your mum, in a stressful age-stage for anyone, and I'm so sure she has really appreciated it, who has been there for you? You are not a coward that's for sure, but you have been through a lot and maybe a bit burnt-out by it all? Its ok to ask for help when you need it, in fact it's really the bravest thing to do. Good luck! Just noticed your gyn who referred you is male and i'm thinking this is probably really not helping the psychological aspects, having an older guy touching you - can you get a lady doctor? Yes your mum was young to be diagnosed, but unless she had the BRCA 1 or 2 genetic type that doesn't mean you are at raised risk of getting cancer. If she did, she is probably even more worried about you than you are yourself, so you can put that at ease by just asking her, Mum that cancer you had, was it the genetic one? Only about 5% of breast cancers are. She might well appreciate the chance to talk it through with you now that you're a bit older. The other reason your gyn might be referring you, he might not be thinking of cancer at all, is that some gyn treatments can make your normal breasts feel lumpier and maybe he wants to get a baseline how they were to start with.",

      "Content": "Jun 7, 2011 11:13AM - edited Jun 7, 2011 02:02PM by hymil Gillovski Im a little confused whether you are actually worried about a lump at the moment or just concerned about the standards of care in the UK compared to that in Jordan and anywhere else you have been treated. I'm sorry your friends outcomes. Standard of care in the UK is mammography screening every three years from 50 (now falling to 47) to 70, existing breast care patients are usually recalled annually for five years follow up but this may vary in your area. Over 70 can opt in but will not be called. For a first breast-lump-related visit to GP, the guideline is that if the GP can feel your lump and you are over forty, you will get an urgent referral to be seen at the specialist centre within a fortnight, at which you should get triple assessment: mammogram + fine-needle aspiration + ultrasound and you should go home that day with a definitive diagnosis although for a few of us the FNA may be inadequate you may need a small biopsy or there may be difficult to interpret histology etc and you might have to wait a week for final outcome. Which is the pits. Once you are \"in the system\" as a known patient, there is then a quick re-entry process eg If i went to my GP tomorrow with another lump, I would be seen again very quickly and I imagine this would also apply to you once your BC history is known. If you let them know sooner rather than wait till you have a problem, they could probably try and get hold of your previous notes/xrays if possible. The screening system is not without its glitches: i recieved a routine invitation to the mobile mass-screening while awaiting my appointment for one year follow from the oncology centre, it seems the national system has no mechanism to link with the specialists, eg it doesn't automatically exclude the breastless!!  I think if i had had a bilateral instead of uni and wasn't concerned about monitoring the other side, I would have gone along just to see their faces.. I think it's the same sort of programme that invites 103 year olds to register for pre-school... then having had a CT scan telling me my pelvis was normal they got upset because i haven't had cervical screening for a while...  You do need to find your way out of the one-size-fits-all approach to get what you need.",

The key is in your word YET, this is NOT the finished product that you will need to learn to live with, it's just an interim stage pre-recon. I'm reminded of when my baby (long since!!) probably then about 3months old and in a fairly good routine, woke up late at night after a long long car journey, to see her first ever hotel room. Eyes open very very wide, find bottle, eyes tightly shut, bottle empty, bubble up, slept through till midday! The unfamiliar room hadn't gone away when she finally surfaced, and she was both soaked and starving when she did allow reality to peep through the curtains, but it all looked better after a good nights sleep (and believe me, so did the travelworn parents!) So what you described, to me is almost like if you had woken up during surgery, (heaven forbid!) think NO! shut eyes firmly, get back under a while longer till it's sorted! Right now your chest is very much a work in progress, not a photo-opportunity and you found a way to cope that works for you. Just, I suggest you do a quick look, long enough to check for obvious problems developing, infection etc.  The unbalanced look is unnerving, and usually we have more time to get used to seeing a pair of saggy boobs. In fact i am totally in denial that my one remaining boob sags at all..... just need to be careful when i do up my belt.....",

Calamtykel, There's no such thing as a faith failure in my book; it's a bit similar to the health perspective really, based on facts not on how you feel. You know God is there and hasn't forgotten about you. There's a time to ride on what you know to be true, even when it's hard to feel about, it's a tough time, but that's something only you can do. While your friends do the praying, if you feel you've lost the knack,, you just get dressed, get out there, hug the kids and keep putting one foot in front of the other.

The other aspect is that your team won't meet these tumours very often: my oncologist in a big city sees maybe five new cases a year, and most of those are fifteen years older than me, so it helps to give them time to do their homework. You are quite right to challenge and try to personalise your care away from a standard one-size-fits-all package if it doesn't feel right for you: You will probably still have this body long after they have reitred! I challenged my onc's suggestions, and we negotiated I would come back in a fortnight after he had a chance to contact a few colleagues to ask what they would do, and was better able to listen to the advice as a result. Doesn't mean I took it all! The third thing is I have been told about mucinous tumours that the regrowth pattern is most likely in the same breast and next most likely in the other breast, so chest wall rads which i did and good surveilllance (mammos ect) which i will now be getting, is good cover for this risk, and personally i chose not to subject my whole body to extra hazards. It's cowering under an assault of exercise and better diet instead! I don't think a doctor can really make a decision like that for you.

Maybe if you can show her that your main support is elsewhere ie you have joined a support network but you do really need the time off, she may realise you are not asking her to be someone she isn't, and feel less threatened. its not like you want her to hug you every morning, just to let you come in late twice a week (replace with your own needs) within whatever your rights are. In the UK a cancer diagnosis automatically brings you some protection under disability legislation, I don't know what the position is where you are. And as Lhya said, the girls here are really great, we do good compassionate, we understand.",

Overweight is defined as \"10kg heavier than me\" I learnt that at work from a doctor, true story, On a study day about manual handling, no less, so it must be true. Too many overweight people around these days he said. Bet he wished he had gone into bariatric surgery, not teaching  By the same token, middle aged is \"10 years older than me\" and I am now 50. (Beat you Iago, by two weeks! Errrr, eeeek, how did that happen??) He, the wise doctor lecturing, was considerably older than me BTW, and a good deal fatter. So having left my childhood somewhere in the dark ages, or maybe in the loft, I had better get on with some adultery before i pass directly into premature senility. See, I still think of myself being about 23. Granted i got a bit less stamina these days and my skin needs ironing.............and chocolate costs a shocking lot more.....  A friend at work told me long ago, \"I'm not 63, really I'm nineteen; If I had known i was going to live this long, i would have looked after myself a bit more\"   a great motto however long ago your parents started claiming tax relief on you. It's essential to plan your baking strategy in advance. No good having the oven warmed, the eggs whipped, the pan greased lined and floured all ready to go and all the flour sugar etc all measured out, and only then you discover it's ten at night and you've ran out of chocolate - are you really going to get dressed again, fooby wig sleeve eyelashes and whatever other paraphernalia BC has added to your busy life, just to drive to the late-night store so you can finish making those brownies? A hypothetical question requiring no answer. but to those who responded YES of course we are, welcome to my world: I have no sense either! I do have emergency chocolate though, and no day-hike is complete until we have eaten it. Youth IMHO, when it doesn't relate to a lad that DD brings home for [my] supper, is a state of mind, not an unverifiable chronological mistake made before electronic records began. They did have vinyl for records in the era of my purported arrival, EP but not LP ( i was born forceps AKA special-delivery, and in black and white): My parents' generation were born in wax on cylinders, handpainted by candlelight and lucky to be alive with all that cholera diphtheria whooping cough measles and miscellaneous other annoying nasty diseases, and general grinding poverty, and my grandparents' records are on comb-and-paper, if they got born at all. There's no official evidence they all did. So this middle-aged lark, is it a debatable fact about the body you live in, or a state of mind? And inside your mind, reality can be what you want it to be??",

You really have been through it, soldiering on at work despite everything, but eventually you just get burnt out on it all. There's a good page on it here (and the links): http://www.macmillan.org.uk/Cancerinformation/Livingwithandaftercancer/Symptomssideeffects/Fatigue/Fatiguecancer.aspx   Grief, thats a process of loss and subsequent adjusting, we are facing with the loss of reliability of our bodies and being thrust into a world where we are the mercy of others, might not be able to keep on earning wages and we don't know what's round the corner. Physically you and i may have had an easier ride than many other BC sufferers but the mental challenge is still there, and with the fatigue as well. It's fine to be kind to yourself, lots of us are here with BC today because we were not kind enough to ourselves in the past and were too busy putting everyone else first. If you can't be kind to a friend when she has BC, when can you be, and now that friend is you. Does it help to know there's a medical reason to be depressed, you are not cracking up, you have had a life threatening illness and a very scarey time. But you are still here, and you will get through this.",

And we get cross at the surgeons for doing their best. Worldwide however, the commonest cause of LE is not nice clean surgery by highly trained professionals, but a parasitic worm that gets in through walking in dirty water, (because you have flooded \"streets\", no wellies and no sewers) it burrows in and finds your lymph system, settles down and makes a good living off your body fluids, it grows and grows and grows until the lymphatics get blocked, then you get LE usually in both legs, because there's a massive worm inside of you EWWWW,  GROSS, I would rather have had cancer and its treatments ANY day than that.

The large footprint and pressure at the edges takes some getting used to after.. the others... Originally I did perfectly well with the fibrefill take-home from the hospital inside a sports bra, then after an accident at the bathroom sink which precipitated a social crisis [\"Argh, i need to go out NOW but it's soaking wet!\"], i had to make a substitute in a hurry which worked pretty well, and worked better when weighted with a silicone cleavage-enhancer bra insert, and i then attacked a large sponge to create a makeshift swimboob. The needlewoman in me made several cotton covers from scraps of old tee-shirts fabric. Then saw the thread on beanyboobs which fascinated me and I made one of those too, so got quite a variety now as the mood takes me. But the first sponge perished with the chlorine and collapsed in a powdery heap, the second let me down in an embarrassing cloud of bubbles, and as we now have snow on the ground I'm not running outdoors, and I want to get back in the pool, hence the \"proper\" form. It's transparent so if i have to fly - heaven forbid, with all the current security stuff - at least you can see there's nothing there, it's just clear jelly. Whereas the whole reason my BC nurse didn't give me a regular prosthesis eight months ago after i healed and finished rads, is that she was showing me disgusting dark-peach coloured wrinkly things that just sat there flobbering on the desk and reminded me like lumps of raw liver eeuwwch!! Now if she'd have offered me one of these clear silicone softies instead.... Ah well, Foobs for Dummies - LOL, lovemygarden!",

Sanbar, i suppose with the mole you have to question whether it really needs to come off, is it malignant or just plain ugly, does it catch on your sleeve edge and keep getting infected, etc, and then balance the risk of removing it from the risk of leaving it in place. Also there's more than one way to remove moles and skin lesions depending on their shape and depth, could they maybe tie it off at the base, or freeze it off like they do with verrucas? Or laser? although the results might not be so pretty as cutting out an ellipse. Would look for a second opinion on the options.",

I'm exactly a year out from diagnosis and finished all active treatment 4th May this year: so I'm now [ NED / in remission / cautiously optimistic ] , and trying to move on with my life. On my way back from seeing the onco last friday, I found a great book (it would be more accurate to say the book found me) by a young guy who had survived bowel cancer against the expectations of his medical tream, he wrote it at pretty much the same stage I'm now at, and he also raises these questions. Latest update I can find is that he was still alive and very well last autumn at nine years out. For him it's a matter of faith that God has cured him. \"It's finished, don't look back.\" I love his approach, I admire his faith and the way he has noved on. I'm very glad for him and his wife that he stays well, and is released from the constant fear of looking over his shoulder waiting in case it comes back, but it does raise so many questions. I'm really strugggling with this. Great if I'm cured, but then so why am I bothering with all the hassle of losing my [sadly under-appreciated] loveable-cuddliness, severely rationing my chocolate like there's a war on, and spending so much time at the gym that \"Jim\" shoudl really be my better half, why am i bothering to fight oestrogen? I say it's to do with changing the chemical makeup so that any stray cells will meet a hostile environment and not grow easily, but actually... Frankly it's illogical, it's because i chose not to do tamoxifen and will really have egg on my face if the thing does recur. Doing something, anything, creates an illusion of control, when in reality the long drives i do each two or three weeks are a much more present and acute threat to my wellbeing. I can't imagine that i will still be gym-hogging in ten years time! I have the same issue with aged relatives who would just worry if they knew I have had cancer: being practical so long as I outlive them it doesn't matter if im cured, what matters is not letting them down by expecting to be allowed skip out of visiting duties!",

Leah: If there are objections ask what they would do if they had a patient with only one arm having surgery in that arm!  Very good point     well they would just have to use a leg wouldn't they, unless you're talking highly invasive central lines etc, so if they have no leg cuffs available they better go get one! Have they no paediatric cuffs either, because there are some ladies especially very elderly or oriental ladies with childsize arms: what do they use in the bariatric surgery section? They should have a full range of sizes. You will find the fat men's arm cuff goes round most normal size thighs. and Stavmom, it's not the surgeon you need to convince its the anaesthetic team. They are the ones normally more holistic, concerned about the whole patient coming out not just with a fixed elbow but generally actually alive and healthy. See if you can talk with them direct?",

Officially, staging happens at the time of surgery apparently. ??  So even if you had mets and the treatment makes them recede and disappear by the time of surgery, you are then classed without them in the same staging-group as people who never had them, HOW WIERD!!  But also because mucinous tumours are \"large for dates\" to use a baby analogy, LOL, size really isn't everything.  They initially told me the nodes were okay; then at surgery I had a very close chest wall margin (basically zero but not, they said, actually infiltrated ....  yet -??) and also one of the nodes was not as nice as it could have been; although they were calling it clear, there were signs that it had been bad earlier before the neo-adj  So it seems I could have been considered  anywhere 2a-2b-3... can you get locally advanced early stage?? no wonder I'm confused!  I think the TNM classification also helps, as \"TNM-300\" which is how I'm labelling myself (as mental shorthand for the various combined possibilities of  T2-3,N0-+,M0) is a fairly unusual combination,.but it's the M0 that makes the biggest difference.

The two nicest things the doctors said about me this year are, \"She has made a splendid recovery from surgery\" and \"She has no risk factors for BC\". Well, that's not strictly true as I'm female, and at diagnosis last year I had a BMI 29 was a bit of a couch potato, and I had failed to breastfeed beyond eight days due to my own medical postnatal problems. But it did feel such a relief being told this BC is not a direct consequence of something I had done. Medigal, That's not a dig at you or HRT and I do wish I could be able to take it but now I wont be able to, as I'm ER+ too, so if I live long enough from the BC I will probably follow mum into osteoporosis instead. It's a reflection that Dad got lung Ca only four years ago but he had smoked fifty years, and he had to deal with regrets and recriminations as well as all the medical stuff .LIke my family doctor said, We all have 20/20 hindsight and at the time they didnt know all the risks..... Now as for stress however, those doctors had no idea the stress i have dealt with over fifteen, twenty years or so. I didnt ask for erratic hormones, i didnt set out to get divorced or raise a child on my own or take on the wrath of my [previous!] church as a result, i didnt plan to have sole responsibility for mum when Dad passed away or do all the choosing a nursing home stuff without help from sis, and If I had known i would have to do it on my own I could have been living a whole lot closer and saved a wellfull of petrol not zooming across the country every other week. My occupation is well known for stress too although I managed to avoid too much responsibility, but only by staying at a lower paid grade which obviously has stressful financial implications, particularly when Ex decided to quit paying child-maintenance while baby was well too young to earn her own way. No, I don't think the doctors even asked about stress, or maybe they didnt care. It's not something they can change, and anyway it's history, they have to deal with the person in front of them as they find her. But in the absence of any other factors.... i think it was definitely my trigger. They have shown that stress lowers your immune system, and that normally we all have loads of little tiny cancer-seeds but that the healthy immune system normally blots up most ot them. So what to do with it? I already do what I can to limit stress, i've done the chill-out and the time management and the assertiveness and the SWOT (strengths weakness opprotunities challenges) analyses and the Myers-Briggs and pretty much anything else apart from hypnosis or acupuncture. Quitting work is not an option. Marrying a millionaire... well, with half a cleavage that's looking increasingly unlikely...  At the moment I'm becoming an exercsie-endorphin junkie just trying to feel I got some control over my body, my life. Hmmm  I almost convinced myself, but not quite. Fun and laughter I'm working on (see my millionaire comment above!) and i'm also perfecting the art of making lemonade. There are a few practical things i can do like asking for help with my computer/connexion problems, and spending time with friends instead of spending the evening just me and the vacuum cleaner, especially relaxed low-stress friends,  and also Im trying to steer a course of least regrets and then not beat myself up for bad choices made on limited information. Being positive is hard but, like love, it's a decision not a feeling, so here goes: girls, your pictures look lovely, Chrissy I'm sending you a bucket-load of cyber-lemons and we can sell the produce!",
