So, instead of 4 Decatron, 2 morning and 2 at night the day after chemo, I took 1 1/2  in the morning, one at night....leaving one for the next morning and, finally, 1/2 for that night.  He didn't want me to have any additional pills but instead allowed me to extend them and it did help.  Found the fatigue started coming a day earlier but it didn't hit me like a ton of bricks like before.  I still was emotional on day four but not as bad as previous treatments.  All in all, the tapering worked in my opinion.  My regimen is Taxotere and Cytoxan (with 4 Decatron day before, day of and day after). ",

I had very minor side effects.  I was tired and a little achey around days 3-5 but rebounded after each treatment.  I managed to exercise throughout chemo, which I think really helped a lot. The radiation knocked me out in terms of fatigue and worse than chemo in my opinion.  I never had any nausea with the chemo.  And, while it's no picnic...it was certainly doable in my case and I'm very glad that I opted in and took the treatment.  I'm now at 25 weeks past my last treatment and my hair is growing in thick and curly. I trimmed/shaped coloured it and ditched the wig at extactly 12 after (May 7th) and have had it trimmed twice since May.  Just had my roots done yesterday.  Not everybody has a lot of side effects and not everyone has all of the ones they say \"could\" happen. Hang in there and be sure to put ice bags on your finger and toe nails during the full Taxotere infusion. It will help a lot.  Also, chomp on ice chips through the infusion as that will help minimize mouth sores and the yucky taste in the mouth. Sherri ",

Instead he suggested I go back to using Biolage moisturizing shampoo and conditioning balm, which I used to use before chemo.  I must admit, it does feel much nicer since I've stopped using the Nioxin as it was much dryer then. He says Nioxin has alcohol in it among other things that I don't need. He wanted me using Biolage because one of the ingredients is sage and that is good for my hair growth.  MarieK - your hair is coming in very nicely. I hope you get the cut you want before you head East for your trip! Juanelle - I like the wave that's coming in on your hair and the color is fantastic. I can see why you're getting compliments!  Sherri ",

Now it's growing in and am so enjoying the short 'do.  I'd like it a little longer on top but I stopped wearing my wig three weeks ago at 12 weeks after chemo finished. I thought I might have been lucky and had mine not fall out but like most everyone else, mine came out, too.  I never lost it all but I certainly couldn't go without a wig or head covering.  I also think the hairs that do hang on end up coming out when the hair starts growing again.  Kind of a shedding sort of thing.  My eye lashes and brows thinned and then fell out at 8 weeks after chemo but grew in right away. Good luck! Sherri ",

This is kind of like the perms I used to get in the 1980's. So far, this is bouncy and soft. Not sure how long the curls will last, though.  My SIL had chemo two years ago and she said her's was similar and now it's straight. I'm not going to grow it long again. Right now my plan is to keep it short but just grow my bangs and the top a bit more. Sherri ",

If you are ever interested, there is a salon at Credit Valley Hospital called Capila by Truly You. They also have a salon in Streetsville (a part of Mississauga).  Anyway, they specialize in all kinds of hair loss, including chemotherapy related any many other conditions.  Heather is the manager at Credit Valley location and Amalia is the owner, who I think primarily works out of the Streetsville location.  They are absolutely wonderful, very kind and discreet. They carry great products and are extremely knowledgeable about different conditions. I've dealt with them for my wig, buzz cut, scalp treatment and also took my 10-year-old daughter to them when she was experiencing dandruff.  They put her on a special program and everything is fine now. Once I have some hair, I will be going to them for a while as they know all about colour after chemo, etc. Please let me know if you have any questions. ((hugs)) www.trulyyou.ca/  Sherri ",

They can also be parted any which way and the part line looks very real and natural.  The less expensive (under $100)....don't have the same technology.  They can be more uncomfortable and can feel itchy, especially around he band. That said, I think the Raquel Welch wigs I've bought on eBay are very nice, lightweight and comfortable (with the liner on), look good and I \"enjoy\" wearing them more than my wigs that cost $$$$.

The other is a human/synthetic blend in a similar style.  To be honest, I don't wear them much at all.  The human hair one is heavy and needs a lot of work to style and I feel kind of guilty because my mom bought it for me and I can count how many times I've worn it.  On a lark, I bought a short Raquel Welch wig on eBay and I love it and wear it most days.  Sherri ",

To my surprise he said, \"yes, we have had lots of clients over the years.\" I had initially thought I'd go to the wig shop at the hospital for the next year as they are a full service salon, too, but I'm tired of going to hospitals and want some normalcy in my life. Therefore, I'm going in on Friday morning so he can take a look \"under the wig\" and to get a protein scalp treatment.  He said to stop with the Nioxin right away because all I need to use is a gentle shampoo with sage in it.  He's really an expert on hair so I trust what he's saying and am going to give it a try. I normally go to one of his stylists but for this situation I'm going directly to him. Mine is getting thick and I can see a wave coming but I need to get the chemo tips snipped off so the length is more consistent. I'll report back after Friday with what I learn! Sherri ",

Your hair looks terrific in each and every one.  Every length looks like it's a deliberate cut as opposed to post-chemo hair growing in. I hope I didn't jump the gun and colour min too early but it was an impulse thing when I was in for a protein treatment. I'm so glad I did, though, as it feels so much better. As it's a demi, I suspect it'll fade faster than a permanent. Good thing is, I won't be washing as often as when I used to get my long hair coloured so maybe it will last okay. Sherri ",

Mine's been growing and I've had regular cuts every 6 weeks to trim off the chemo ends.  I'm now thinking of going a lot shorter in the coming months. Not sure exactly what I want to do but I'm not planning to grow it long. I always had long hair and I can say I like it better short.  Never imagined I'd prefer it short but I really do. ",

So, on May 7th 2010 I went out without a wig, scarf or hat and nobody looked at me strangely so I never went back to the wig after that.  It's hard to believe it's been a whole year.  I tried to post of farily recent picture but couldn't figure out how to do it.  Maybe you can see my current hair in my little avatar photo.  ",

Losing my long hair was difficult but I now have short curly hair and I really like it and plan to keep it short.  I have absolutely no regrets whatsoever.  Please hang in there....it does get better.

The very next day, the report came in as a copy to my GP and she phoned me right away telling me the good news that all was clear. Had she not taken the time to do this, I would have had to wait two more weeks to get the results from the surgeon.  My GP is wonderful. She's called me at home after my lumpectemy and a night the day the initial path report showed invasive cancer....all when she's been simply copied on the reports. ",
