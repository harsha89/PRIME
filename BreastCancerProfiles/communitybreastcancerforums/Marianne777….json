I'm sitting here, and amazed at myself, really, I'm relaxing here on the sofa, looking once again, at this site. I alway's feel forarmed is forwarned! The 17 th of Jan. i felt my breast very sore, but paid no attention to it , next day, it was still sore, come the Monday morning, i rang for appointment with my local doctor, there was a cancellation, I could pinpoint the lump,and she could feel it, she said not to worry, it might just be a cyst, she sent a referal to the hospital anyway. On the Wednsday, I received, a phone call, from the hospital, with an appointment for that Friday(23 rd).Everything flying along, Saw the doctor, he was sending me for a mammogram, so off I went up to the Radiology Dept, had mammograms,she then asked me to have more intense ones, back in I go, I could see the lumps myself on the screen, two I didn't know about, so she said she would like to do an ultrasound next, so in we go next door, to have them, ok, she said, I would like to preform a biopsy,I was taken aback!I said Now,she said while we have you on the table! So I had 3 biopsies done one, a needle,the cyst, the fluid was clear ,then she done 2 surgical ones, she gave me a letter for the doctor downstairs,he just said, they would know the results, next week,so tomorrow(Friday) is d day. Wasn't that quick? I think it has helped, that I wasn't waiting long,It's called Triple Assessment,all done in the one day!I'm imagining, a senario, where theres Benign, to the left, and malignant, to the right,and I am walking down, the Yellow Brick Road, not thinking of eather side, its keeping me calm! Thanks for reading,!",
