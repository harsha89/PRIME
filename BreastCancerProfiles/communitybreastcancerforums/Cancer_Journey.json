    "Content": "Cancer_Journey wrote: I am 39 and was diagnosed with breast cancer in my left breast just before Christmas. I have the BRCA1 gene, so I am high risk. Things are moving along very quickly. I thought I was in the clear after seeing my surgeon, Dr. JC Gauthier, yesterday and getting a date for mastectomy of Feb. 9th. Today the hospital called me to set up a bone scan. My surgeon said nothing about this yesterday so I'm quite rattled by it. Is it standard procedure to have a bone scan before surgery or does it mean they've found something? Log in to post a reply",
