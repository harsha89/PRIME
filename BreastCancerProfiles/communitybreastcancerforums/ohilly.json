I also take Femara, which can also contribute to hair loss and thinning. For a long time, I had a lot of anger about this. I felt it would have been easier for me to accept if the doctors had forewarned me, but I also always got 'it grows back' from them. Yes, it does grow back (at least in most cases) but not like before. It took me a long time to accept my 'new' hair, but now I can say that I truly have. Don't waste your time on a bunch of medical or cosmetic treatments for thinning hair that don't work - i went to a salon and they did a lot to cover it up. People even tell me I look better than before.  If I had to do it over again, I would not let my fear of hair loss determine my treatment. But I just wish I had been prepared.  Hope this helps,  Ohilly",
