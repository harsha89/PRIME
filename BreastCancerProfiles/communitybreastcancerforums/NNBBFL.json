I think it is because I don't want a cancer diagnosis to be what defines me. If it were a business secret it would be disclosed on a \"need to know basis\" and that is how I look at it. The few I have told I was very comfortable telling and have been very responsive. I just can't imagine what it must be like to have people react negatively.

I believe your positive attitudes makes a difference. I also agree that our odds do keep increasing as new treatments are being added to the many that already exist. It is so different than a generation ago. I just got my 2nd PET Scan results and am soooo elated. I can't wait til tomorrow's visit with my oncologist to go over it with her. There is \"significant improvement as compared to prior examination with significant decrease in the bony metastasis, resolution of most of the pulmonary metastasis, and decreased uptake in the breast mass and no new lesions are noted.\" The results also stated a significant reduction in the tumor size but did not state a new measurement. I am a bit confused by this as earlier tests measured it, or maybe it was the CAT Scan not the PET Scan. For the cost of these tests I think that they should correlate exactly. Do any of you also get the reports sent directly to you? I like to have mine so that I can prepare my questions in advance for my oncologist. I find that if I have them written down I can go down the list quickly and not forget to ask anything. This is now the 7th month for the Arimidex and I hope this run lasts longer. I also continue to eat according to the Budwig Diet. Not sure which it is or if it is both but something is definately working for me so wanted to pass it on. One of the few friends I have told said she can't believe anything is wrong with me because I look so healthy.",

Sorry that you are having some issues with the Herceptin but don't really know what you mean by the big D. My mets are in my spine and as I noted above the lung nodes are just about gone but I will ask about the drug you mention for the prevention of brain mets (Temodar) at my oncologist visit on Thursday. Thanks for your input and I second your wish for blessings and positive energy for all of us Stage IV sisters!",

I was dx at Stage IV and have bone (rib and spine) and lung mets. It is good to see that many of you have been around for years. I like others have googled and read the stats so I just asked my Onc to verify if those numbers (about 33 months) were the \"average\" and she did confirm but also stated that so much depended on the individual case and that as new therapies evolved it could be many years longer. Being dx at Stage IV, I have never had surgery and am on Arimidex as my first treatment. I was wondering how many others dx at Stage IV also never have had any surgery either? I am post-menopausal age. I did not have insurance til April so it was then that I started the Arimidex treatment but before that I started on and have stayed on the Budwig Diet (no sugar, no white flour, no meat,no supplements and no fats except flax oil and cottage cheese. So that means I eat mostly fruits and vegetables and some whole grains and occasionally fish. I lost 30-35 lbs from Jan-March and feel really great. After starting the Arimidex I get the night sweats again (more like floods) but I can deal with that. I just had my second PET Scan (first one was in March as a baseline) and am waiting to find out the results. My last blood tumor level counts were in the normal range so I am hoping to see that the tumor has shrunk considerably. Although Arimidex has been used for years after surgery or chemo, I think it is relatively new as being used as a first line treatment in post-menopausal women so have not seen a lot of data out there in regard to how long it seems to work. I have read though that efficacy is dependent on the percent of ER and PR positivity. Please comment if you are on Arimidex as a first line treatment or know of someone. ",

Your signature does not state what stage you are (though most on this thread are stage IV) or if you have any mets but it does show you both ER and PR positive. I guess doctors in different areas may follow different protocols. Did you go to an oncologist or surgeon first? I know that I was unable to even see an oncologist until I had insurance.",

The way I see it anything that makes you feel good is worth the effort. I actually feel like the credit for my doing so well is as much the diet as the Arimidex but how is something like that ever proved and does it really matter. NNBBFL are my initials and where I live...Boynton Beach, FL.  Btw my son lives in Bedford, TX. That is a tough decision about the surgery, you were smart to get a second opinion especially with this disease as it seems that \"conventional wisdom\" is continually shifting. 208sandy, Sorry for your dx but glad you found this thread. Somehow it is easier to say things here than telling those who may not understand. Hope you continue to find the Arimidex more tolerable this time.

Cancer cells have a way sometimes of overcoming obstacles (ie mutating so that a treatment which at one time held it at bay, no longer works because the cancer has built up a resistance to that particular drug). Complicate that further by some reasearch which shows that what works for the primary tumor may not work the same at remote sites (mets). It is all trial and error but it buys us the important thing---time. Precious time that may at some point find a true cause and therefore an effect for cure. Til then we have trial and error of the various treatments.",

That said, I think that is partly because I completely changed the way I eat since my dx. I no longer eat meat, sugar or white flour. I get natural sunlight daily and exercise. In the first 4 months I lost about 35-40 lbs and another 5-10 lbs over the past year. My concern also is what happens when I stop feeling so good. I have only a few friends who I talk to more than I see and my only family is in another state. I have a seasonal friend who I hang out with the most when she is here (7 out of 12 months).
