When I was diagnosed after a biopsy in February 2009, I was scheduled for a bone scan, an MRI and PET scan, to see if I had any mets or other tumors within my body.  The PET scan is a fasting scan where you fast prior to the test, they inject you with a sugar mix (apparently cancer likes and feeds off sugar) and then you are motionless for about an hour while it processes, then they do the CT scan.  It will have the sugar congregating where there is cancer or a tumor.  The MRI is done also with a contrast injection, and for this they usually do just the breasts (I had a breast MRI where I lay facedown with my breasts suspended through the table, very weird), but it gives a 3-D image of the breast to see if there are any other tumors or areas of concern in the breasts.  Thermography is typically not used, at least in my area (south florida) for diagnosis.  The bone scan was one more test just to make sure my bones had no tumors or areas of concern. Good luck, and keep us posted as to how you are progressing and what your next steps are.",

They were very secure without any chance of them falling out - these are fairly deep pouches.   She knew how many drains she might be getting - Her doctor told her to prepare for up to 4 drains, which was why we were looking for something that could hold 4 (2 pouches will hold 4 drains).  We looked at the camisole for her and she liked the idea of the belt better because she could adjust it either over or under her clothes and either on her waist or a bit lower on her hip (I called her sheriff drain when she wore it hip length).  If you are getting 1-2 drains, then probably just the one belt with one pouch would work just fine for you.   I spent a week with my friend after her surgery to help her with the kids so her husband could return to work earlier and I was amazed at how great this thing worked for her.  ",

Dawn, I am doing just fine - working out like crazy and starting to lose some weight - I was able to get into a favorite pair of jeans that I haven't been able to in at least 1 1/2 years.  Hair is coming in, more slowly than I want (who doesn't want it to all just reappear??) but it will be doable for the ball next week - I'm getting a special post-chemo new hair coloring by Joseph Mullen while I'm in NYC next week -he insists on doing it before the ball, which is really cool.  He's working on a whole treatment / coloring instructions for stylists when working with their post-chemo ladies because color doesn't take to the clear / gray hair very well and comes out muddy.  Very busy at work, which is great - I function best on all cylinders and like to have crazy deadlines.  Next follow up is with my new med onc who I had an initial appt with last month.  Love her!  specializes in breast cancer - don't know why I didn't listen to my brother and see her first.  Oh well - at least I have her now!  Started super low doses of tamox, so far, doing okay without any major and very little minor se's, so we might have actually found something that works!! Dawn . . . where are your photos???????  How is your hair coming?

Helen, I was so sick during chemo too - just not the right kind of treatment for me.  I feel so bad that I can't do anything to help you - it hurts to read that you are not dealing with this well.  Have you thought about talking to a breast cancer counselor - do you have anything like that in Canada at the centre where you get treatment?  Or maybe a grief counselor?  I think they could help you with the adjustment of the bm and the entire repeat round of cancer.  We are here for you, sweetie.  ((((((Big Hugs))))) to you!!!",

Amy, to post photos (it's a little complicated but once you figure it out it's not too terrible), you need to have your photos on something like photobucket or flickr, any online photo album.   Copy the URL for the photo you want to post, and then while typing your message, click on the little tree icon next to the smiley face.  A pop up box will show you where to paste the URL for the photo and once you click okay, it will embed itself into the message. Judy - know how you feel about stepping back into the doc's office.  First time I went to the building where I had gotten chemo, which is also the same place my volunteer group, Pink Tie Friends, holds their meetings in the breast cancer library, I almost vomited.  Going back to the breast surgeon had me shaking, even though it was for a follow up post rads.  Our minds protect us from the worst, but it's still traumatic to step foot into those places that either gave us bad news or where we had to deal with difficult things.  Good luck, sweetie!",

Alaina - I love your writings!  You are so funny - Abercrombie and Fitch!!  I love how you name everything!!  Keep the faith - you are going to feel better once you come out of the fog and the SE's - it does get better - we were pretty much all feeling better by the end of the first week, and I know personally, I felt great last week and this week.  A lot of us are getting treatments this week, some today, tomorrow and for me, Thursday, so I'll be where you are by Saturday and Sunday.  What a way to spend a weekend!!  With my luck, it will be gorgeous out and I won't want to or be able to go or do anything!! Nadine, you know I'm with you!  My doctor said not to gain too much weight (and I said, huh?  I could hardly eat once the steroids wore off, but while I'm on them, get out of my way!!), and then I was finally able to eat normally - and my brother, a nurse, says to make sure I get enough calories, and well, I'm happy with the fluctuating weight levels because they seem to go up and down within a few pounds of each other, depending on where I am in the tx cycle.  I am not looking forward to this weekend either, but I'm hoping its no worse (how could it be?  oops, don't want to jinx myself!) than the first weekend, and that by Tuesday or Wed., I'm feeling better. While the stubbies are driving me crazy on my head, I can't shave it all off because of the strawberry marks, so I might reshave it with the guard to see what else can come off.  I am loving wearing different wigs (subtly different - two long, like my hair used to be, and two short) and being able to take my \"hair\" off when I get home from work and just put a bandana on and go.  If you had asked me a month ago how I would feel wearing wigs and having no or very little hair, I would have said, are you insane?  It is also giving me a chance to see where I'd like my hair to grow back to when I'm done - and while I like the length of these wigs, I think I'll keep it a little shorter, closer to the shoulder length, because it's easier and still flattering.  These chats with everyone are so helpful and fun - everyone in their own way is going through our own versions of hell in order to survive and become the regular, everday super-women we were and still are!!!  Have a wonderful day.",

Helen - you poor thing - I have heard shingles can be painful - you definitely have had your share of crappy things - and this coming before the wedding when you have things to get done - geez!  I hope your medication helps clear it up quickly so you can get fitted for the dress.  Yes, children are brutally honest.  My daughter's friend's little kids saw me in my wigs and scarves and the other day one of them asked me, \"is that another wig or did you finally grow hair?\"  I explained that yes, my hair had grown in, and she said (she's 6), \"Oh, because it still doesn't look like your old hair, so I thought you might still like the wig.\"  Sigh. Judy, Geri, Titan, all of my sisters - I hope you have a peace-filled week.  Judy, good luck starting therapy - it is a positive step towards feeling better.  Take care, ladies.",

Hope you do okay with the steriods.  Are your symptoms similar to this?",

I do also agree with Lesley - it was good to feel well enough to go back to work and be busy, helps you take your mind off things, but also be aware you might not feel 100% the week immediately following your treatment, that usually is the second week.  If you are able to do more telecommuting, do so, if for nothing else than you can rest in between calls or projects - your body will demand it! Make sure you get lots and lots of fluids during treatment - water and gatoraide, a little white grape or apple juice were all I could do, but everyone is different.  Protein and complex carbs also are very good - whatever you have an appetite for. Good luck!  You have joined a wonderful sounding board.",

Judy, my onc also told me that fatigue can creep up on us more easily than others, because of the rigors our bodies have gone through.  I hope it resolves somewhat for you.  good seeing you all, Alaina, Titan, Helen, Amy, Geri.  Can you believe we are coming up on our 2 year anniversaries?  I try not to visit any dark places, it is hard, isn't it, the minute we have something weird happen.  Checkups with the onc continue to be good.  I am trying to eat well (read:  right), and splurge at least once a week.  My onc would prefer me to lose about 10-15 pounds, and I am trying, but not killing myself.  I know weighing less is better, but I try not to stress over it.  Working out a few times a week, I have discovered Zumba and really like it - I like to dance anyway.  Drinking a nice glass of wine every night, just because.  I figure it's almost the same as resveratrol, and now that I'm making less, I am not buying so many expensive supplements, but trying to get the same benefits in food (or drink.). Hope you all are doing well, and I'll check back in with you all now that you have gotten back into your chairs.  Hugs. Michele",

Happy summer to everyone - hope you are all doing well.  Had my mammo/ultrasound and all is clear, and a follow up with bs gave me an all clear for the next 6 months.  Follow up with onc next month and seem to be doing okay with the tamox, but I know she is going to want to put me on an AI soon and I will not do it.  either I will stay on tamox or go without, but I tried every AI and for me, they were terrible.  The pain and fatigue were just like with the Neulasta (I saw a few comments a few pages back about that) and I felt like I was a cranky 80 year old instead of a cranky 48 year old.  :) I also get some post-traumatic flashbacks, especially from chemo time, if I smell a certain smell, or eat something I could only eat during chemo.  and, I gave away all of the tops I wore post surgery, too traumatic to have them.  And of course, i still have minor freak outs about weird pains, symptoms, etc. Been busy traveling for work - any of you on FB see my frequent conference updates. Just came back from Naples, FL - 5 day conference that actually allowed for half day sessions, so we could lounge by the pool.  I brought my husband and we made a little vacay out of it - it was heaven, relaxing by the pool, actually sitting motionless or floating when it got too hot (90+ in Naples this time of year).  Before that was Boston, which would have been nice, except I was recovering from that flu/upper respiratory/eye infection/incredible body aches thing going around and it was cold and rainy during my trip.  anyone who has rain, please send it down to my area of South Florida - we are in an \"exceptional\" drought and praying for rain before our beautiful lawn/trees/flowers go away. Wishing everyone a great weekend - we're not doing much, still kind of in that vacation state of mind. Michele",

Titan - blonde, wow.  You'll have to update your photo!  I've been fooling around with light brown, high lights, both coppery and blonde, and am back to very dark brown.  Finally growing in enough to look like a moderately short hairstyle instead of the military looking one, and the curls aren't too bad since I had it trimmed and shaped a few weeks ago. Geri, Judy and Helen - hope you are all doing okay and feeling stronger every day. I was just thinking the other day, it's been almost 1 year since the hair fell out and my last tx was 4/23 - and everything we were going through this time last year - how terrible we felt, all of the strange se's we were going through and how we helped each other through the worst times of our lives.  I've been feeling okay with the exception of lingering mild le, that causes me breast tenderness and nipple pain, and I try to manage with occasionally wearing my le sleeve and doing the manual self drainage I learned in physical therapy.  If that's the worst, I guess I can deal with it though it would be nice not to have any more se's of any thing.  Hmmmm . . . the new normal, I guess.  My next medical step is a mammogram, but until the le is at a pain-free level (when will that ever be??), they don't want to do one and I heartily agree!  Been busy with work, and out in the yard, and moving my mom 10 minutes away instead of 3 hours away.  Life does go on, my friends!!

I'm doing okay - though after reading about Geri's heart issues, I must confess that I have been having a definite increase in the irregular heartbeat that has always been a part of my adult life.  I take atenolol when the pounding or fluttering gets too much, and for the past 6 months or so, it's been every day.  If I don't take it, I am not in pain, but that fluttery, can't sometimes catch my breath feeling is too much.  I have mentioned it to both my primary care and my oncologist, who checked me out and said everything is fine.  Sometmes it happens to post-menopausal women.  It's hard to believe that it's only a \"normal\" part of aging and that maybe, even though I only had 2 chemo sessions, there wasn't a little bit of damage done (because I had such terrible, horrible se's) on top of taking tamoxifen.  But, I have been reassured that there is no problem.  I am going for a cholesteral blood test next week, because my numbers are high (partly due to heredity - I am of Sicilian descent, and we have horrible cholesterol - my mother, sister (who is in great shape) and brother (a body builder) all have it too.)  May need to go on medicine, it will depend on what they see as far as the breakdown.  Otherwise, feeling pretty good.  Working out again, thanks to a donated treadmill, and it makes it easier to get the walk/run in without leaving the house (or the A/C!). I see many sisters on facebook, that's where I primarily hang out, both socially and for work - I am still working for the medical device company and we have fb presences with both products that we sell, as well as twitter.  I am still traveling a lot going to plastic surgery conferences, which is nice, because I do like to travel, so it gets me across the country frequently.  I think I have been blessed finding this job, because I really enjoy it, and the people I work with (small company) and the products we are making really, truly help people in different ways.  The product I was responsible for launching in July directly helps mastectomy patients and anyone who gets drains and tubes, and that really makes me feel good, knowing that other women can be made more comfortable. Ladies, I am so happy to see all you moving through your lives, which can be challenging at times, with health and personal issues, and stresses of the world, the day, everything.  Know that I pop on and off and have been following you and am with you. Hugs to you all. Michele ",

Oh, and Lena, melantonin doesn't do jack for me either.  I have all kinds of natural sleep aids, and none of them allow me to sleep through the night.  only 1/2 ambien.  Been this way since dx, haven't been able to sleep at all, just a few hours each night, but with my little friend, I am at least sleeping.  I've always been a light sleeper, but the dx, surgery, chemo, etc. really did a number on my head and it just wasn't happening.  So, 1/2 ambien every night.  Hope everyone is doing okay, surviving the long, long winter (we've had a weird winter here in FLA, but  nothing at all compared to the snow bonanza that the midwest and north has been). Talk to you later, and definitely after I get my results.  Here we go again. ",

I cried harder while getting my hair cut off, and my husband cried with me, knowing that it was as if a part of me was already gone.  The surgery was easy.  This was devasting.  Starting chemo the next week, I was determined to get through it with as much mental and physical strength as I could - I would and could do it!  The side effects hit me very hard and shook my confidence to the core.  I wasn't sure I wanted to continue with the chemo, but decided that the first one was the worst, and I would keep going.  When I attended the Look Good...Feel Better workshop, I went with excitement about something just for us women to help build our self esteem.  Boy, did I need it!  With the short ugly hair and the looming knowledge that I would soon be bald, I wanted to learn as much as I could about keeping up my appearance and spirits.  Although the youngest in the class at 46, I felt a kindred spirit in the women who were there with me.  The bag of makeup and products were amazing - the level of quality in what we were playing with and trying on was not what I was expecting and it was so much fun to learn the tips and tricks that would help us.  I returned home feeling like I could stay beautiful, and that I was not alone!  I could do this!  Fifteen days after chemo, we shaved my head.  It was not as traumatic as cutting it, because I knew I was beating the cancer.  I began wearing wigs I had purchased to work and out for errands - and it was a fun game at work of \"which look would I have today?\" because I had gotten wigs in varying shades of the beautiful brown my hair had been, and lengths from the below shoulders I started with to fun shags, a bob and a short style I knew I'd be wearing when my hair returned.  My eyelashes and eyebrows were still there, so I felt and looked normal.  I have gone through the hell of chemo, gotten through the weeks of radiation and am growing my hair, eyebrows and eyelashes slowly in.  As I look at myself and the transformations my physical body has made, and the scars across my chest - these are my battle scars.  They are proof I have been to war with breast cancer and armed with the tools and information that I have received from Look Good...Feel Better, the help from the American Cancer Society, my family and friends, and my own inner strength - I have found that it is my courage and strong will to live that has proven to light the fire in my core - and that radiates to my smile and my determination.  I am a survivor, I am a beautiful woman and I will be here on this earth a long time.",

OMG, can we say drag queen?  Okay, well, I did!  She asked if she could do a smokey eye on me and I said sure, and it was beyond smokey - really horribly dark and not at all flattering.  Combined with weirdly light brown eyebrows, I Love Lucy lips and two dark slashes on my cheeks and I did not want to go to the ball.  I was being filmed at that point and had to fake being pleased and excited about my look.  I ran to my room to try and remove as much as I could in the 5 mins I had to put on my ballgown, and at least got the eyebrows and lips redone.  No fun, but the ball was so beautiful and raised a ton of money to support the LGFB program.  Rest of the weekend was terrific - saw my sister and we had a blast. Now going to concentrate on getting rest and excercising again.  Oh, and my eyelashes are falling back out - at least they waited until after the ball to do that.  Brows are getting thin again - I don't know if they will fall out.  Bummed about the lashes - I did not ever want to have to do this again.  Chemo . . the gift that keeps on giving.",

I too am having more hot flashes again - especially at night.  They went away for a while after I started tamox and have come back.  Maybe it's cyclic? Thanks about the hair - after everything I went through this summer, I am especially grateful it is now growing with a vengeance and yay, my bangs are back!!!",

Alaina, nice to see you again too!  I had my 6 mo. onc follow up last week and everything is A-Ok.  Bloodwork was perfect and they are impressed at my energy levels (I guess we're not supposed to be like energizer bunnies and keep going and going, but I am).  I'm on the 6 month follow up schedule and as I come up on my 4 yr dx anniversary in February, and move into the 5th year, I am not sure how they begin to space out the visits afterward - maybe 1x a year or it probably depends on how long they keep you on tamox.  All I know is that I am finally starting to feel \"normal\", whatever that was, meaning, for the first time in 4 years, I am feeling more like I did pre-BC.  My hair is as long as it was in November 2008, that I feel good (for the moment) and am trying to keep moving forward.  I am too saddened by the passing of three women who I had \"chatted\" with and were bc sisters and friends - I am not sure if one of them was on BCO, but we lost Sue Barnes Augustine, and Reneepals, and Lynn Brinks Connell.  It is still startling at the number of sisters who are suffering and struggling so, and saddens and frightens me. I am getting ready for the holiday - we're having about 8 people over and I'm cooking a 21lb turkey (I have the three wise-men bottomless pits: my 19 yr old nephew, my husband and my firefighter brother) because I like to actually have leftovers!  Pie baking will start tomorrow and I do enjoy cooking the huge meal - its my favorite meal of the year, and I don't have to do any cleanup, which is a bonus.  Also getting ready for my 50th birthday - it's coming up next month on the 24th and as I am the chief party planner/organizer in the family, it is a challenge for my daughter & sisters to plan a \"surprise\" party for me on the 15th.  Only reason I know about it?  My sister called and asked me to pick her up at the airport and she is staying with me.  I think the guests are going to be more surprised than me, because I had to give my daughter the list of people to invite and how to reach them.  My daughter told me, \"I don't know how you do this so easily, this is so hard!\"  It will be a fun party and I will relax and enjoy it - which will be hard to do, but I know I can!  Give me a glass of vino and I'll be set. Wishing each of you a wonderful week - stay safe, warm and well fed!!  Hugs to you all.",

Florbo, I was surprised to read about your status change from - to +, that is weird.  Did your oncologist offer any insight about that?  I did not realize that one's HER status or ER/PR status could change, but I guess it can and it is something to keep in the back of the mind.  Best of luck with your new round of treatments, I hope you aren't suffering too many side effects and hugs to you.  I agree, nothing is too TMI and I have fielded some weird questions from newbies coming on board too.  Actually, I still suffer with chronic constipation - think its from the tamoxifen.  Oh well.   I am doing well, just dealing with some headache issues that had me concerned, but it's my stupid neck needing adjustment (it goes \"out\" every few years) and a few trips to the chiro will remedy that.  Have an onc appt. in May as well as the fun but necessary mammogram.  Busy as crap at work, traveling a lot at this time of year, I've been to Las Vegas, Miami, LA and San Diego since January and will be headed to NYC in 3 weeks.  Then it should slow down, travel wise for me, but not work wise - which is good.  Busy is good for me. First day of spring sprung and I know a few of you had anything but spring weather yesterday.  We are having our last \"cold\" front (oooh, weather in the 40s tonight) and then for south Florida, it is going to just start heating up and bringing on the humidity.  Fun!  Geri, wish you were closer during your visit - it would be really nice to meet you all - we've been through the wringer and back and some are still wringing.  Here to help as best I can, if you need me. I am sending each of you a virtual ((((hug)))) and wish you all well this week. Michele",

Geri, try adding to the Zantac with some Mylanta, Pepto or Tums.  The entire tx weekend from hell, and for several days afterward, I was on a steady stream of Prilosec (which I take anyway, daily), Pepto and Tums, and GasX, of course.  It did help, as did not laying down very quickly after eating anything.  I've had acid reflux for a long time, so it made sense not to do it again. Nadine, I've been craving smoothies too - especiallly on tx weekend #1 - I didn't really want anything more than chicken, or a smoothie or shake, that kind of stuff.  I was going to buy a blender (I killed ours last summer with the last of the frozen margaritas - melted the blender but saved the drinks!), but my mom is getting it for me - I told her to make it an early Christmas present, because I wanted to start making smoothies again.  I might pick up some of the protein powders to supplement with as well.  We have a really good smoothie place here in Florida, and we usually do those for lunch on the weekends and split a wrap. I'll keep you all posted after my onc visit tomorrow to talk about the shortness of breath - which is better today, just if I start laughing or exert myself too much, I notice it.

Going for my first post-mammo tomorrow morning, and an ultrasound, because the onc's office said might as well get it all done at once.  Kind of nervous, I think more from the pain standpoint - any of you have your mammos when you were still a little LE swollen?  I will mention it to the radiologist so maybe they'll go gentle on that boob. Wow, we've all come across the 1 year mark for starting chemo / losing hair / etc.  I was remembering back a year ago - and I think I was in the middle of that horrible head rash thing.  It's always something, isn't it?  Amy - I agree - the longer out we are from it all - surgery, chemo, rads - the less we think about it, but certain things bring it all right back, like visiting the onc, bs or other docs who treated me during it all.  But yes, sometimes you just think, Good Lord, did I really go through ALL of that?  Judy - me too - if I smell a certain smell or see or taste something that I came across during chemo it brings back those memories too - I can't go near ginger ale or smell a certain Glade Plug-In that I had in the house during that time, makes me nauseous.  It's the same association with certain things when I was pregnant with my daughter, over 26 years ago!  If I smell this one perfume, I literally gag.  I was morning sick in a department store (I know!) in the perfume department and that smell associates with it.  Funny how the mind does that. Check in with you ladies later.  Have a wonderful evening.",

Geri, I would love to help you plan your Hereceptini party!!  I love to organize events! Got the official mammo results - said there were no huge changes from last year, nothing to be alarmed about.  That's good, and the onc's office was pleased, so I guess that is good.  They haven't mentioned to me about going on any more AIs, so maybe I'm done.  I should have a 3 month follow up coming soon, at least I need to get one more in before the insurance goes away in September, unless I am on a new plan by then.  Waiting for the paperwork to come in for COBRA and I guess I'll see what the premiums are on that.  I hear it's expensive. Helen, how are you?  Amy, whew, I'm relieved it's just a cyst.  I had many of those over the years when I had my ovaries - too much estrogen bubbling over!  Your super curly hair looked like mine before I had it trimmed a few weeks ago.  I'm going to get mine relaxed a little next week - with the incredible heat and humidity that arrived here in south Florida a few weeks ago, even though I painstakingly blowdry and flatiron my hair into a cute little short hairstyle, spending just FIVE minutes outside turns it into a curly mess.  I tried to work the curly hair last weekend, just to see and it looked JUST like Rizzo from Grease.  Just not me - I think it makes me look too old.  If I wanted to 'fro it up, it would be a super fro.  We could all go as '70s girls with our \"natural\" hair, tie dye and peace signs.  Lena, hope you're doing okay on Aromasin.  Femara was terrible for me too and isn't it amazing at how quickly you feel better (normal) when you stop taking it??  Titan, I agree - the \"cancer\" subject can make some family members very uptight - my sister still won't really talk about mine, my treatment or anything.  Just glazes right over it, like if she doesn't think about it, it never happened. I don't have any photos yet, but I was chosen as one of the calendar girls for the group I volunteer with, Pink Tie Friends (www.pinktiefriends.org) for their 2011 calendar.  We did my shoot at the beach, at my old bosses (not the one who laid me off, this was a previous employer) beach house - I wore my typical outfit - t-shirt and jeans, bare feet (or flipflops) and we took a few different shots.  I'm nervous - I don't photograph well, I get too stiff and weird in the pictures, I like being BEHIND the camera.  When I have a chance to get some of the shots, I'll post them. Have a great weekend, ladies.  Everyone relax, enjoy and smile.  :)",

I changed my avatar, so you'll see it 2 days post relaxer, actually, I got a mini-keratin treatment, it was around $65 and they put a pre-treat softener on it, and then the keratin, used the flat iron to make it ridiculously straight that i had to keep for 2 days (and it's like 95 degrees and I am sweating like a proverbial pig, but couldn't do anything about it - you can't touch it, move it or anything), but then put a nice color on it to tone down the brightening (it lightens up your color, as most chemical treatments will) and styled it myself and I really am happy.  It took all of the bulk and frizz out and left me with beautifully silky, easier to style hair.  You can see it here and it was worth the money.  Will stay like this for roughly 30 days or longer, as I don't shampoo every day, try for every other day or preferably if I can stand it, every third day. Lena, I forgot about the clot issue.  Sorry.  What did the estrogen depletion do to your dopamine levels?  What is dopamine, anyway?  I'm at the lowest estrogen (read: none) levels, and don't really know what a domamine deficiency does. Went on a second interview with a job I would really like, but they are looking for someone who really is into excel, and while I can handle most typical tasks, I cried Uncle when it came to what percent this, and line graph that, etc.  So . . . have a couple of leads for next week and we'll see what that amounts to. I hope everyone has a great weekend.  Just enjoyed a nice glass of very cold chardonnay with some aged parmesean cheese slices, cherry tomatoes and kalamata olives - a snack we had every night in Italy.  Yum!",

Have my onc visit tomorrow - should be uneventful, hopefully, but I have a feeling they'll schedule me for scans and mammogram, especially in light of the recent lump scare.  I'm not worried about it (much), except that I have new insurance and it isn't nearly as comprehensive as my old policy, so more is paid out of my pocket.  Amy, I am glad you finally went to a new onc - doesn't it make a difference when your doctor isn't a jerk?  I wish I had my current onc from the beginning, but glad I have her now. Betsy, sending you hugs about your mom. Ladies, have a good evening - hope everyone is finally getting some springtime warming up or melting.  We're near sweltering here in Florida, but that goes with the territory of having the air conditioning on since February.  Talk to you soon.

Eyebrows grew back initially really thick back in June, but they are now the thinner line they were prior to starting chemo.  Lashes are on their 3rd or 4th fall out - the bottom ones fell out a couple of weeks ago and have grown back, the top row was very scraggly with a few long ones that looked really stupid with mascara on them, and the new ones growing in too short for anything, so I had some individual lashes put on today at the salon.  Must say, it certainly looks better than the weird long/short combo.  They'll last a few weeks, which will help as my lashes come back in.  I hope they are finished with this major fall out!  It's something you really don't prepare for, especially after they fall out once and come back, and then fall out again and again. ",

Wishing everyone who celebrates a very happy Passover (I know it started earlier in the week - hope you had a fantastic Seder) and wishing those who observe a very Happy Easter.  Been super busy at work, so hoping today is fairly quiet (think it will be) and then \"hopping\" off to start a weekend with some nice weather.  Hugs to you all.",

I started the week with my mammogram appointment - which had my nerves singing and humming this morning - always a stressful time, isn't it?  I think all went well, because they didn't ask for additional views, which has been the case for the last couple of times - I had been going every 6 months, and I am hoping that if all is clear, I will be back on the yearly visit schedule.  I see the med onc next week for my 6 month follow up and have much to discuss with her.   I took a self-imposed tamox holiday about 2 weeks ago, and while the insomnia is still happening (PTSD?, who knows?), I do have to say that my low back/hips, shoulders/neck, headache and wrist are definitely NOT hurting like they were, nor am I having knee pain.  Maybe all I needed was a month off - I will talk with her and see what we need to do.  I am not going on an AI - I had such severe and dramatic reactions to those (all of them - we tried everything prior to the tamox), that if she wants me to continue the tamox, maybe all I need is a little break now and then.  I also made myself get up early this morning (5:45 is a horrible hour) to get on the treadmill for 20 minutes of a combined walk/run.  I am dedicated to doing this on a 3x week basis, and trying to incorporate weights again into some sort of workout rythymn, if for nothing else, than to try and budge this stubborn weight.  Of course, I haven't been the most vigilant with my diet - I do eat very healthy, but my DH is a dessert hound, and it's really hard when he is always bringing me a black & white cookie, or brownies or ice cream.  I usually resist most nights, and grab the blackberries instead, but its hard! Hope all of you have a good week - and a big hug to each and everyone of you.  :) Michele",

I'll let you all know how that goes. Glad to hear everyone's visits are going well, treatments are being tolerated and everyone is doing okay.  Helen, I am so happy you had a great time at the wedding - you deserve that so much! Hugs to all, and talk to you soon.",

I am growing my hair out, though I doubt I will get to the length I was at dx, midway down my back.  Looking at old photos, it really wasn't the most flattering, so I am thinking more of a shaggy bob, chin length or a little longer.  My stylist said it could take another 6 months or so before I see any great length - the top and sides are growing out and the curls aren't so bad (but I also blow dry and flat iron) and have had several trims, the last one being about 4 weeks ago, to get the fuzzies off.  The bottom part, where it was very kinky curly, has relaxed some too.  It's getting better - looks more like a short hairstyle rather than a supershort style, so that's some consolation.  It is very dry, don't know if that's just my new texture or what, but if I put a moisturizing mask on weekly, and have a conditioning treatment with color (I just put a very dark brown on, was doing more light brown with highlights and had gotten very faded from sun) and it is very shiny now.  Bangs are getting long - I can trim them up and they reach my glasses.  Still not long enough for much else, but I have been experimenting with headbands and such, and it's nice to have some options.  A year ago, I was shaving it off because it was hurting and falling out at work.  Time is a great healer.",

Take care, everyone. ",

Joseph, my sister is a hairsytlist who I am just starting to speak to again - for those of you on the boards with me a long time, you know what I went through with her - found out she had withdrawn from me because she couldn't deal with my cancer so soon after our dad's sudden passing and she was terrified she'd lose me.  We're making up a lot of lost time now!!  Anyhoo, she recommended for my hair Schwartzkopf.  \"O\" series with 20 volume, depending on the color.  4-0, 30 grams, unless you have a 4-5 or a 5-5, which will give me a rich brown.  10 grams of that.  Don't go equal parts, because some of the gray or clear colored hair can turn up \"hot\".  40 minutes at 20 volume.  If you use 4-0-0, it will make it too matte.  Oh, and I'm getting my weird, wispy hairs trimmed today by her - I saw her last night, we've been talking and she's got a lot of catching up to do, a lot of grief to let go of and a lot of family to bring back into her life - but she is going to trim me up so I don't look like Kramer from Seinfeld or some kind of bushwoman when I get to NY next week.  First haircut since March!!!!!!!",

I cried harder while getting my hair cut off, and my husband cried with me, knowing that it was as if a part of me was already gone.  The surgery was easy.  This was devasting.  Starting chemo the next week, I was determined to get through it with as much mental and physical strength as I could - I would and could do it!  The side effects hit me very hard and shook my confidence to the core.  I wasn't sure I wanted to continue with the chemo, but decided that the first one was the worst, and I would keep going.  When I attended the Look Good...Feel Better workshop, I went with excitement about something just for us women to help build our self esteem.  Boy, did I need it!  With the short ugly hair and the looming knowledge that I would soon be bald, I wanted to learn as much as I could about keeping up my appearance and spirits.  Although the youngest in the class at 46, I felt a kindred spirit in the women who were there with me.  The bag of makeup and products were amazing - the level of quality in what we were playing with and trying on was not what I was expecting and it was so much fun to learn the tips and tricks that would help us.  I returned home feeling like I could stay beautiful, and that I was not alone!  I could do this!  Fifteen days after chemo, we shaved my head.  It was not as traumatic as cutting it, because I knew I was beating the cancer.  I began wearing wigs I had purchased to work and out for errands - and it was a fun game at work of \"which look would I have today?\" because I had gotten wigs in varying shades of the beautiful brown my hair had been, and lengths from the below shoulders I started with to fun shags, a bob and a short style I knew I'd be wearing when my hair returned.  My eyelashes and eyebrows were still there, so I felt and looked normal.  I have gone through the hell of chemo, gotten through the weeks of radiation and am growing my hair, eyebrows and eyelashes slowly in.  As I look at myself and the transformations my physical body has made, and the scars across my chest - these are my battle scars.  They are proof I have been to war with breast cancer and armed with the tools and information that I have received from Look Good...Feel Better, the help from the American Cancer Society, my family and friends, and my own inner strength - I have found that it is my courage and strong will to live that has proven to light the fire in my core - and that radiates to my smile and my determination.  I am a survivor, I am a beautiful woman and I will be here on this earth a long time.",

Judy - I agree with you.  while the super short hair is trendy and all, I do associate it with being \"sick\" and do not want this reminder all of my life.  I think I will keep it shorter than I had, maybe more piecy and layered, but not this short.  I will keep you posted - I am continuing to lose lashes - and my watering eyes are not happy.  Brows seem to be holding their own.  I had mine waxed and shaped as soon as they grew back in - mostly clear, and I have to say, they are still not dark now - not as dark as they were - they are kind of brown but very light, like ghost brows.  I see stubbs where the lashes are coming back, but when trying to apply mascara yesterday I realized only the outer lashes are remaining on top.  None on bottom.  Super sucks!",

Jo, you can get wig shampoo at Sally's or online - Lisa1964 may have some other advice as to how to wash them - I wash mine every other week, very gently dunking them in the wig shampoo, spray on a little wig detangler and let them air dry on my porch, then brush them out and shake them into shape.  They are very easy to take care of.",

Florbo, yes - it is from the chemo that you get the white hairs first - apparently from what we're finding out as our hair is coming back is that the follicles seemed to be programmed to restart, but the pigment doesn't seem to get that message until a while later, so what you see is a lot of grayish or clear hair.  I am still getting some of that, but most is coming in with my natural dark brown color, especially the thick hair at the top and the fringe that will be my bangs and side hairs.  That's why I couldn't stand it anymore and had to use color at 12 weeks pfc - I could feel the hairs, but couldn't see them, so I used Clairol Natural Instincts in a dark brown that is the same as my natural color and it was as if they grew overnight, I could see them all!  If for nothing else, it definitely boosts the self esteem and resassures us that yes, it will grow back, just on it's own timetable.  I've been having my DH give me scalp massages, similar to when you go to the salon for a wash and cut and they massage your scalp.  Haven't needed a salon in 6 months, so missing that - and boy, did it feel good!  Plus, I swear I could feel the blood rushing into those follicles. ",

Sharon, yes, it is definitely a relief to have the hair after the struggles I went through this summer!  Yes, getting the first trim was rough (I don't wanna cut any hair off!) but it really helped shape it up and now hopefully it will just keep growing and I will learn to deal with the waves, curls or whatever sprouts out of my head, as long as it keeps on sprouting!!",

Betsy, I did wigs, but briefly.  I couldn't deal with how hot they made my head (it was May/June/July here in Florida, where it's not only incredibly hot but incredibly humid and I was struggling with sweating, etc. would literally rip it off my head as soon as I got in the car).  I switched over to bandanas as soon as I could and then bareheaded.  Again, blame the heat - it was just too darn hot, even for hats. Had my 6 mo checkup with the breast surgeon - everything is good.  I guess he'll continue with the 6 mos schedule until I hit 5 years.  Can you believe we are coming up on our 4 years or some have already hit that?  Incredible.  Really is a blessing. Working hard - still traveling a lot - headed to Vegas next week for a conference.  Family is good and I've been feeling great except for the twinges and tweaks, of course.  Turned 50 in December and I swear my knees decided okay, it's time to start hurting.  Trying not to let it slow me down and continue my exercise program and hubby and I are both making an effort to eat much better (he's the dessert king).   Hugs to everyone.   Michele",

On the hair front, it is getting longer, I'm happy to report.  It's kind of a weird cupie doll look now, the top back portion wants to only stand straight up when I flatiron it - and eventually it goes back down.  Hair is starting to grow over my ears.  Not much length in the back, but it is getting a little longer.  Still very curly at the bottom.  Last night I was goofing around and took a couple of pony tail holders and made three little pigtails, one on either side of my head and one on top, kind of like Gene Simmons from Kiss.  We had a good laugh over it.  I can flatiron most of it to get the kinks out of it, and then use all kinds of product to make it piecey. Sanaisa, yes, it does get better.  When I was able to color or attempt to color the hairs coming in on my head, at about 6 weeks, it made me feel so much better, because I could see more of them since they came in clear or gray.  The brows . . . yes, the brows are hard, because they really define your face.  I use a brow powder/wax combo that comes with an angled brush, to help fill in - my brows filled in once really well and have gotten thin again, so I use pencil and the powder.  When your brows start to come back, get a brow gel, Anastasia makes a great one, that is like mascara for your brows.  You can put it on the clear brow hairs and see what you have.  I also used it on some of the spots on my head that were stubborn to color.",

I understand about the heat and humidity, it is pushing over 90 most days here in Florida, with humidity to match.  Ugh.  I was content with road riding during my treatment and it took me several years to build up the stamina again to be able to get back on the trails - you are doing so well with your treatments, you will get there.  I am so happy your scans are clear!!!  As I push closer towards the 5 year mark, and am off meds, it is almost like I am on a very tall mountain trail, with a deep dark ravine on one side (bc) and a difficult but doable trail on the other (life after bc) and while I occasionally look down in the ravine, I push on further and further up the trail, towards the top and new horizons.  That is how I am looking at the 5 year milestone.  I am working out almost daily, have changed my diet now that I am off tamoxifen, and am seeing results.  I actually have a much flatter tummy and my face and neck have thinned out and I feel great.  It's hard work trying to get the to the top, but I will do it! Helen, glad you are healing, albeit slowly and with some issues - gentle hugs to you. Judy, glad your sister is coping during her treatment - I know it is unnerving to have her going through it, and it is so close to home for you.  Prayers to you and her. September 11 - I am a bit somber today remembering that terrible day - and those who died - I knew a few fire fighters who were in the towers who didn't make it - and being originally from NY and my grandfather building those towers, it is a devastating blow, even 12 years later.  I still look over when flying into NY and the skyline just isn't right.   Hugs to all of you.

Mine is getting to a shaggy dog stage - the sideburns are getting curly and unruly, and I am finding the only way to wear this hair now is to flat iron what I can grab, and then use molding paste to make it all as spikey as possible and smooth down what I can (nothing, and I mean nothing, flattens out those back of the neck curls!!) and just go with it.  Sort of looking like the finger in the light socket, but it works.  I am getting so many people telling me to leave it short, but hell no, I am growing this stuff back in after the agony of losing it!  They don't understand that part!!!",

Anyway, on the hair front, it's definitely starting to get longer, and slowly fill in.  It could be a cute, very chic super super short hair style, if my scalp weren't showing so much.  Still need a bit more to fill in, and then the wigs are gone, but will still need coverage from the sun.  The front area around my hairline is really moving along, but the left side, where the folliculitis was so bad seems to be taking it's time.  Kind of lopsided with filling in.  When I put the nioxin on, I can almost get the ostritch hairs to lay down.  Some of them are long enough to start laying down.  10 weeks pfc on Thursday.  I'm taking biotin daily, and have started on my antioxidants now that I am done with rads - C, E, Zinc, etc.  plus added fish oil caps and vitamin D.  Definitely feeling good, anyway - energy level is coming up now that I'm done with rads.",

Yes, I am wigless and hatless - I started going wigless towards the middle of June at work, didn't really wear them out - you live in Florida, so you know how hot it gets - and was wearing bandanas and scarves until about 3 or so weeks ago.  Now, I make sure it's covered if I am going to be out in the sun for a long time, because you can still see scalp on the very top (my boss is fixated on that spot, it's so funny, he keeps glancing at it as we talk - he gets very squeamish about anything medical, and especially anything girly-medical, so it's actually pretty funny).  Another funny thing is our CEO came to our office this week, and he hasn't seen me in a few months, and must have forgotten I had chemo.  He walks up to me, gives me a hug and we are chatting and then he says, \"wow, you are sure wearing your hair short these days.\"  I replied, \"uh, yeah, because it's growing in.\"  He and I got a good laugh when he realized he'd forgotten and said, that was good, because otherwise he was going to recommend I fire my stylist!

They said that about halfway into my treatments, probably next week some time, they will measure me for a different type of treatment, this is the boost some of you have talked about - my last 7 treatments will have this apparatus on the machine that will target the scar tissue only, like a surface treatment, just to make sure.  anyone else having or have this? Treatment 5 was easy.  Came home, took my antibiotics, got the stuff on my scalp and then gave myself a good aloe vera dose.  Hope everyone has a good night.",

Unfortunately, since our heads are at the top of the body, I think those signals are a little slower (sigh) - but really I think what it is is the fact that our heads have sooooo many follicles and we are so impatient to look like ourselves again, that we are making ourselves crazy because all of the follicles didn't turn on at the same time.  I am getting much thicker - exactly 4 months PFC, except for that darn thin spot at the top of my head - it's covered a little better with thin hair, but it's like the last to come in. Helen, I'm so sorry you aren't seeing more results.  Have you seen your dermatologist?  They may have some suggestions for you, since it's been a while and you aren't getting anywhere.  Are you using Nixoin follicle booster?  I did that on my brows too - and they grew back fairly quickly, though from plucking the same hairs year after year, they didn't thicken up in the area I wanted them too.  but, they are back. Dawn, doing okay!  Just came back from a weekend trip up to my mom's to help with some things she needed done around the house.  DH pulled his back out lifting boxes, but he is out there grunting and groaning cleaning the car. ",

I've been doing manual lymphatic drainage on myself - I have a lot of congestion in the breast still, and a very tender nipple area with discharge.  I see my surgeon in August and will ask him about it then.  The MLD helps, as does wearing my sleeve occasionally.  Otherwise, feeling pretty good.  I've been in a slump where I haven't been working out the last month (gee, wonder why) but got out at 6:15 this morning for a walk/jog (okay, more walk than jog) and it felt sooooo good, I need to pick up and start again.  If for nothing else, then to just bolster my self esteem and well being.  Trying really hard not to start in with junk food and eat all day.  Eating as healthy as I can, lots of fruit and veg, limiting bread, etc.  Its so easy to fall back into the bad zone.  Have any of you tried the Jello dark chocolate mousse??  60 calories and it is incredible!!!!  1 large glass of vino each night, right now it is too hot for red, unless it is the light beujolais I had last night, otherwise, chardonnay, pinot grigio, etc. are my summer staples. Lena, Betsy has a good point.  I also cannot at all tolerate the hormone stuff, but I did really well on tamox (except for developing an allergy to it) - it is a natural vag lubricant too, so the benefits there were pretty darn good, but there was NO bone pain, NO fatigue, nothing like Femara or Aromasin.  There is also another alternative to tamox, can't remember the name of it, but it begins with an \"f\" - I tried that too but had the hive issue.  Try that, if your onc is game, because the se's are minimal.

My onc agreed with me 100% that stopping treatment is the right choice for me, given the way my body is reacting to everything with secondary side effects occuring every time, and getting more serious.  He was such a sweetheart and even gave me a hug.  His main concern is finding out as quickly as we can about the clog vs. clot and getting that resolve - he is on call this weekend, which is wonderful, especiallly if I end up in the hospital. So, even though I will no longer be getting treatments, I am still dealing with side effects that are hopefully not serious.  I'll keep you posted as soon as I am able to!",

Judy, amy is right - we cannot be sleep deprived - it really messes up physical issues with us as well as mental and we have been through so much and have so many things on our minds - that is why I had no trouble asking for assistance.  I am going to look into the therapy you mentioned though, maybe it will help, because I really don't like having to take it every night, and trust me, I have tried, numerous times not to, or try OTC, which just make my drowsy but no sleep.  Now that I'm no longer bruised, I am going to start back up with the working out.  Seems like I get a good groove going and then something happens and I don't or can't work out for months.  Nice hearing from you all - everyone please take care and talk to you soon.",

Doing a little better with the hives - found a topical treatment, a steroid cream that my dh happened to have left over that seems to be helping some - and the derm gave me samples of yesterday.  He said it can take weeks for the ingredient, whatever that was, in the filler of the tamox pills, to leave my system.  I see the onc this week to see what they and I want to do about preventative meds.  My mother is moving down by us this week, we helped pack up her house and the pod she rented this weekend.  She lives about 3 hours north of us, and since my dad passed away almost three years ago, she's been trying to sell the house and move back to our area, where three of her four kids live.  She'll be staying with us for a few days before she closes on the new house she bought, which will be 10 minutes away vs. the three hour trek.  I used to like the trek up to her house, only because the service plazas had Starbucks in them.  But since their contract was up and they put Dunkin Donuts there, I couldn't care less about the trip!  Yes, I am a Starbucks fanatic.  Busy weekend, moving her in, then flying to Vegas on Sunday for a 3 day work convention / classes, then back here, then my dear friends from England come in the following Saturday and we leave for the Keys for a week.  I am so looking forward to that!  We've been saving and planning for this trip and have prepaid all of the hotels / b&b's, so we can just relax and have fun.  Fun is important, especially to us. Found out yesterday that my husband's boss' wife was just dx with breast cancer.  She is seeing my surgeon and will have a double mast. soon.  I haven't spoken with her yet, but will soon.  I swear this crap just doesn't stop! Helen, hope you are doing okay - chin up, sister.  I know it's been a tough road for you and know what we are all here for you.  Ladies, hope you are all doing well, enjoying the little bit of spring weather we've been getting.  Hugs to you all.",

I hope you all are doing well and fingers crossed for Helen, Florbo, Amy and anyone who is undergoing surgeries or treatments, and a big hug to all of you.   Michele",

Day before that was my mammo and I just go the results back - all okay.  Yay - no extra views, no come back in 6 months to check anything.  That's good!  This afternoon is the onc and she and I will discuss tamox.  I have been off it now for a couple of weeks and I feel so much better - the bone aches and pains that were getting worse and worse are gone, the jaw and headache pain, gone, and even the chronic constipation is letting up.  Insomnia is still there, maybe it will get better, maybe it won't.  It's amazing at how much better I feel.  Before I stopped it, I was honestly wondering if this might be the start of bone mets.  I don't feel that way now. Even though I have been in menopause for a long time (surgical, since 1997), every time I start or switch onto an AI or tamox, I get hot flashes for a while.  I was getting them somewhat regularly on tamox, depending on how warm it is outside.  Not seeming to have them now as much now that I have stopped them.  On tamox, since we were talking about \"that area\", I wasn't too dry.  I'll have to see now how dry it is.  We use lots of lube, but since I've been in meno for a long time, it feels dry and arid and it is sometimes painful and burning, no matter what we use.  You become creative at what else you can do, at least we have had to be. Have a great week and i'll report from the onc.  Hugs to you all - I loved reading about your mother's day celebrations and hope everyone had a beautiful day.",

I had my onc follow up yesterday and I am definitely off of tamoxifen for good and not going on any other treatment.  With the side effects building and building this winter and spring, capping off with vision issues, and after seeing my optomotrist in June who said I was definitely starting to develop permanent and dangerous eye issues that luckily were lessening after stopping it in April, we have mutually agreed I am done.  That being said, blood work was all perfect and now we are working on the weight gain (20 lbs) that has happened in the years I've been on tamox.  My onc would never admit it while I was taking it, that tamox causes weight gain, specifically in the midsection, but now that I am done, she has admitted that yes, it does cause weight gain (gasp!).  Am now working on this - cutting out white stuff - flour, sugar, etc. and working out with a more dedicated schedule (working around a broken toe - obtained the FIRST HOUR of our vacation in the Keys at the end of June - I walked into a raised threshold of the sliding glass door on the way out with the margaritas to watch sunset - and no, I did not spill a drop!  Toe is slowly healing) and resolved to make progress on this front.

Have a good day, ladies.  And yes, that's great advice about prepping what you will eat during your days 1-4, possibly 5 on from treatment.  You will more than likely lose your taste for anything but bland bland bland.  I am just now (9 days from treatment) wanting to even look at things I ate prior to treatment, and can taste them.  But, at first, even the thought of certain foods was enough to put me off!!  Now, I want my fruits and vegetables again, spicier foods (though, gotta watch the heartburn) and other stuff that last weekend, oh, no way could I have even imagined!",

Nadine - I am laughing at the hair shooting out of your head.  I agree!!  Especially in the shower, you rub your hands over your hair, well, stubble, and whee, out it comes!!  I have some patchy balder spots than others, kind of leopard like. Glad you had a good day and I understand about the anxiety, I should be taking mine tomorrow morning too.  Good luck today - hope you have an uneventful treatment and the side effects are kind to you in the next couple of days.  My best friend is picking me up in the morning and we're going to breakfast (as a thank you for taking me) before treatment, and she'll drop me off and my husband will pick me up.  I plan on bringing a book, some snacks, water and will ask them for ice for my fingertips. Aoandrews43 - I am having the same glasses vs. wig sides dilemma!  I wear computer glasses most of the day at work, and some of the wigs make it hard to fit them around or under or over the sides.  I spent most of yesterday adjusting both glasses and wig, every time I had to take off the glasses to get up and do something, of course, it was with the prettiest wig I have, that was the most difficult.  I was actually contemplating cutting a narrow slit on each side to slide the glasses in, but didn't know if it would work or not.  anyone else have this problem?",

Do you know if you are having an MRI where you lay on your stomach and the breast hangs down?  Or did they tell you?  Basically, what will happen is you will probably recieve an IV with some contrast dye (does not hurt, feels warm and wierd as it makes its way through your system).  You lay down either face down or face up, depending on which type of machine it is.  Then the table moves into the MRI machine.  It doesn't take very long, maybe 10-15 minutes, again, depending on the type of machine.  Your husband cannot go into the MRI room with you, nobody is in the room while the machine is running.  Usually the radiology techs are not permitted to give you any indication one way or the other - they must leave that to the radiologist, who will relay results to your doctor - so I would advise to prepare for more waiting, but hopefully your doctor will get back to you quickly - stay on that!
