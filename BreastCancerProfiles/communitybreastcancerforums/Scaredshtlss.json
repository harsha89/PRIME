    "Content": "Scaredshtlss wrote: I am a 28 year old woman. A week and a half ago I found a lump in my breast. There were two of them next to each other. They were under the surface of my skin in the upper outer quadrant of my right breast.... One mass was the size of a quarter, the other about a dime. I freaked out and stupidly squeezed one of the lumps to see if it was a cyst ( I often get them but they are usually just under the surface of my skin and can be lanced... ). When I squeezed one, I felt it ''crack'' and it sort of dissipated. I did the same to the other one and the same thing happened. Over the next few days that spot was very squishy... If i pressed or squeezed that spot I felt something sloshing around... Like a liquid... That went away and now the area is so swollen I can't tell what's what. The lump seems to have come back but like I said, the area is so swollen. I can't tell if the lump has grown from me pinching it or if it grew because it's cancerous. I'm also unable to tell if it's swollen breast tissue or a lump anymore... It feels rubbery. firm.. But it feels like it's a part of my breast.... I have tons and tons of lumps on my breast but none of them have gotten this big... It does move but only slightly. It's not like it's floating around or anything. I have an ultrasound scheduled for next week. There was a similar lump in my left breast. Same spot. But it's gone nowa and wasn't exactly the same as the lump in my right breast... I have no history of cancer in my family... I suffer from very high health anxiety ( hence the pinching.. To reassure myself. ) Log in to post a reply",
