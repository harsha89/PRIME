I think I will keep it shortish, although not this short. Thanks, onvacation. carolinames, Thank you! You are about 6 weeks PFC, Are you getting close to going topless? Ossa, I bet it was such a relief to get the work thing outta the way. I have yet to go to my regular grocer, but my excuse is that I go to rads daily now and stop by a store in that part of town instead. It has a better selection there to boot.  I have excuses aplenty.  Your drive home sounds lovely, and not a hair out of place. Ha! I surely understand that.",
