I was told to continue using the lotion they gave me or whatever I wanted as long as I used something. Oh, I also had a rather large keratosis (sp) mole like thing on my upper mound that has now fallen off since rads. One good thing, I guess. I did have a bolus every other time. Mine was like a wet wash cloth but I have seen other pictures where women have something that resembles a plastic cast. The bolus is to trick the radiation filed to get closer to the skin. I also had to hold my breath because my Cancer was on the left side. I wore goggles that showed the computer screen used by the techs and I would hold my breath within a certain zone during radiation. It was easier than I expected it to be.

The nurse said the next round shouldn't take so long since they go slower and go over more information the first time. What I learned: decadron does act as a stimulant and I was up all night last night.  I hope I can sleep tonight since I took my full doses at home and more was added to my IV along with an antinauseau med that starts with a C but I didn't catch the name. Benadryl in pill form. Taxotere first which they stopped for a moment because I was having a weird vision issue in my left eye but it went away.   No Nuelesta unless the blood count drop warrants it next week or if I begin traveling in an airplane for work. I asked about sushi and the nurse said to avoid it days 6-11 when counts are lowest but it should be ok if I go to a good restaurant the other days. No gas station sushi, lol!  She said that most of the bacterial infections come from our own bacteria, not transmitted from others which was consistent with what the onco said yesterday.  He told me to go out and live life.  No airplanes until after round two and we agree on the destination since I do some international travel.  Let's see how I feel. I was hungry when I got home and had a bite to eat...piece of toast and some left over roast beef.  In hindsight the beef might be too hard on my system today to process.  I am getting small stomach ache and my DH is headed to pick up my script for anti nausea that the nurse said to take preventatively the next two days. Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate!  I was floating by the time I arrived for my appointment and luckily was stationed right next to the rest room! The nurse also said that because of the steroid today and tomorrow the fatigue might not set in for a few days.  She also said the hair will start to go after week two on TC.  Hugs to all,  Ann",

If any of you beautiful ladies have access to a Look Good, Feel Better class in your area I nightly recommend taking it.  I had mine yesterday and left with over 300$ in free makeup and a really cute, brand new wig from their wig bank.  They said Pantene purchased the wigs for them. So, now I have two wig options to chose from.  They also showed me options on scarf tying which was helpful Here's the most creative tip they gave me.  Take a large soft T shirt, cut it off under the arms. Discard the arm half. Fold down one edge and put it over your head.  Take the ends in the back and twirl them outwardly until the band around your head is tight.  Take each of the twirled ponytails and bring them around to form a band on your head. Tuck in the edges.  Super cute and very comfortable. Great for this summer on the beach--cool and chic! Wishing us all a tolerable SE week!",

I have an 18 year old daughter graduating high school next week.  She came to visit me during my first infusion and asked a lot of questions to the onco nurse who patiently answered them all.  I think it helped.  Her close friends are used to seeing me bald at home now.  When a new friend comes over I ask in advance if I have to put my hair on or not.  Every single time her answer has been, \"it's just a bald head, mom!\"  She doesn't care.  I did put my hair on for the prom date. Lol. It was the least I could do. I think she is less scared because we talk about it all the time...it is hard to hide it when we are living together as a family and she is a young adult.  If I don't feel well, I tell her.  She rubbed my head when it was itchy and sore.  I wish she didn't have to see her mom so vulnerable...I was always the independent role model, but, this is our life..... And then, I told her this afternoon she was uber cranky and she told me I wasn't allowing her to do anything she wanted for her graduation party... Lol! This IS life!",

Congrats, Timbuktu! Long Island, I need that shirt! Mompv, I was given the choice of TCx4 or CMF over 6-8 months.  I went with TC and landed in the hospital because of the Taxotere.  Was switched to AC for 3 rounds and will have low dose taxol for 12 weeks.  So I will be 6+ months on chemo anyway.  There are no perfect answers.  Just don't look back once you make a decision.  Will be thinking of you. A few days or maybe a week ago several were discussing chemo pause or the lack thereof.  I have experienced 3 periods and spotting on off weeks since starting chemo.  Interesting that so many of us are experiencing heavier and more frequent periods.  My mo thinks my body may be going through its final adjustment before pausing.  I am 51.  I figured I would be paused for good by now! It irritates me every time I am asked to take a pregnancy test and have to pay for it.  Really?  I am 51!  Weird question, everything I read indicated that my skin would get dry and I should moisturize my skin extra well during chemo.  However, my skin has gotten much smoother.  Like baby soft skin.  Not dry at all. Maybe it's the hair loss?  My skin also feels slightly numb when I touch it.  Face, arms, everywhere. Not a bad feeling , just strange. Wishing everyone a SE free weekend!",

I get an extra week off from chemo this week that my mo allowed so I can feel good on Friday for graduation.  It will be last round of AC the off to taxol.  Good luck to those that are in the chair this week. Oh, I have tried both Pepcid and Prilosec when I was on the one round of Taxotere.  Prilosec worked much better for me.   Welcome to our board VeraAnn although sorry you are here.  Your diagnosis is still very fresh and I am sure you are still a bit stunned trying to figure it all out.  You will find these boards of wealth of information.   Most of us will also tell you that the waiting for a plan is the hardest part.  And, if you need chemo, you can see from this thread that you can manage through it.  It helps to have others like these great women to talk to and keep your sense of humor when you can! Happy Monday!",

Lots of hugging going on.  Two days later and  I am still emotional,  and super tired, much more so than previous weeks.  I think I had been pushing through the emotional and physical toll that chemo has on my body and it all surfaced. Good tips on losing weight, cold.  I finally got back on the scale yesterday after 2 weeks of living in denial even though my chemo belly was growing at a very fast rate.  Gained over 5 lbs in past two weeks and it is all in my chemopause/menopause belly.  It hasn't helped that I haven't exercised much other than a couple of walks the past few weeks. Have been too busy working and getting my daughter off to college so DH and I could become empty nesters.  I am so ready to get over the fatigue and get my body strong again! And the lashes? I quit wearing mascara a few weeks ago when my daughter told me I looked scary with it on. I guess my attempt at trying to strategically place them to hide the gaps wasn't helping nor the fact that there were only a few in the center of my upper lids any way.  My brows are completely penciled in and connected by fine white hairs.  Boy I thought this was it....no idea that they could fall out weeks PFC! I am curious when those of you several weeks PFC felt more like your normal self? Specifically, I have an opportunity to travel to Latin America end of September for work.  A part of me wants to go and yet another part of me worries it is too soon and will take too much out of me.  I asked my onco nurse on Tuesday and she thought my WBC should be back to normal levels soon and I would be ok to go from that perspective.  I am so torn.  If I go I need to be assured I have to stamina for full days of work followed by business dinners. When I get tired chemo brain hits at the moment.  Is 3 weeks PFC enough time to be through that? Thanks much,Ann",

Oncotype 16 with one positive node.  Of course, I was placed in the control arm which is chemo and then hormone therapy.  Not looking forward to chemo but feel good about helping the sisters behind us be armed with better therapies in the future.  I also take some comfort in knowing that I will see doctors and have tests more often in the days and years following chemo. I start tomorrow with 4 rounds of cytoxan and Taxotere.  Chrissy, it sounds like we may be on the same regimen. Hoping I feel good enough to watch my daughter play soccer/futbol as she begins her senior year varsity season on Wednesday.  It is Michigan and we are expected two inches of snow so I might get lucky with a cancellation....I am trying to find a sliver lining for getting snow in mid April.lol! Coldincanada, thanks for your detailed posts.  They help a lot and I wish you a much better week ahead than what you have been experiencing. Hugs to all of you as we start this journey.  I keep reminding myself after tomorrow only three more time! Will try to provide an update tomorrow.  Hugs, Ann",

I have lost about 5 lbs since round 1.  I contribute it mostly to not being able to eat for 3 days in the hospital. I suspect by round 2 on Tuesday I will be up the 5.  I seem to be on the macaroni and cheese diet this week! Wore my wig to work today. Everyone was very nice.  But, Holy Hannah, I wanted to rip it off my head by 2pm.  Instead, I went to the bathroom stall and sat on the toilet and took it off and rubbed my head for 5 minutes.  I put it back on in the stall, waited until no one else was around and did the fine tuning in front of the mirror.  It is going to take some adjusting.  Bald is beautiful!",

I was hoping my steroid high would push me into some constructive work around the house tonight, but, it didn't.  Instead, I pondered my hair situation and finally figured out how I will know if I will lose more eyebrow and eye lashes.  My brows continue to thin and lighten. The hair follicles that lighten in color are the first to drop. Touched several of them tonight and they fell out.  Several more are turning.  Curious to see what the morning brings....wait, it is morning, thank you steroids, and yes, I have to try and work tomorrow!  Oh, and the magnifying mirror I used to contemplate my brow issue, has also highlighted the fact that I am growing peach fuzz on my chin at a copious rate this past week.  That is hair I could do without.  So far, the arm pits are staying smooth.  Ok, enough on my hair, lol!",

Sounds like many of us have had a time of it with our first chemo:( I am happy to report that I came home today.  The silver lining of it all is that I have learned a lot about WBC levels, hemoglobin levels and ANC (Absolute Neutrophil counts) and what to expect on certain days of chemo.  In the end I was diagnosed with neutropenia and colitis. Day one is considered chemo day.  I was hospitalized on day 6 which was Sunday.  Generally, our WBC and neutrophils will be lowest day 6-11.  Mine continued to fall to zero through day 8 and began to recover day 9 and home day 10.  I did have three neupogen injections.  Hated the back and hip ache but Tylenol helped. My MO said he will probably change me from Taxotere and cytoxan. To an AC combination.  Not sure how I feel about that since the SEs read similar except for the added heart concerns.  I am assuming 3 rounds since I was doing 4 with TC but I need to confirm that when I see him. Lemonade, I was also told to take the anti nausea to stay ahead of it and it worked pretty well for me.  I took them for three days.  I still had a yucky tummy after that but I attribute it to my new found colitis. I do not have a port either.  After all the blood draws the last 4 days I am almost wishing I did.  I am pretty bruised up now. Holly, you have beautiful eyes that shine with your new bald look.  You look amazing! Ann",

The itching and straw scalp is normal.  I broke down on day 14 and did the shave.  It helped a lot.  The front half of my head is now almost smooth but have some patches hanging in through the back but still shedding.   Went to a memorial service yesterday for a young teacher who ran the math department at the high school who became a BC angel on Friday.  Very sad but a wonderful tribute to the many people this woman touched.  One poignant story was told from a bald male teacher where she asked how he kept his head so smooth and shiny.  His response- Dr Oz was featuring St Ives head cream as the best product.  He has been using it since.  I was two tired last night to check it out but wanted to share it with you. Round 2 was Tuesday.  Trying to stay ahead of the nauseau.  Doing ok so far.  More foggy than after round 1. Tired but not sleeping well.  Trying to remember how many days before my taste buds totally left after round 1 so I can eat something tasty before they go, if I can get myself to feel like eating.  Hoping for a full day of work today Have a wonderful day, ladies.

More nauseous tonight and a bit of a headache and more fatigue so early than last time.  Already have taken emend, decadron, now zofran and will include Tigan in the morning.  No Nuelesta shot tomorrow since bloodwork was very good and I got him to agree to extend my next round by a week so I can feel good for my daughter's high school graduation day.

On your aches and swollen glands I think the aches are normal with no fever.  However, with your swollen glands and unease I would recommend calling the doc office.  That's what they are there for and will provide you peace of mind or a recommendation on how to handle. Timbuktu, I wholehearedly understand your husband's reactions.  I am facing similar.  I think the chemo phase is harder for them because there is no hiding from it.  It is very visible 24/7 and there is very little they can do to help us.  They are scared and my husband finally admitted recently how anxious he had become trying to get through this.  This disease impacts our entire family.  One day at a time.  Ps. I also found my first outings with the wig more difficult than wearing a scarf. I got wonderful compliments on my new hairstyle, however, I felt like such an imposter.  I need to stop qualifying with every person I see that mentions they like my hair that I am wearing a wig. The world does not need to know, but, I can't help myself! Clarrn, probably a good thing you can't remember the name of the person you saw at the store.  What kind of person asks that kind of question???  You look beautiful bald.  Your eyes pop!",

There has to be something out there that is easier on your system.  You shouldn't have to suffer so much.  Or maybe ask if you can go to low dose taxol weekly for a period of time to get your taxane allotment.  My MO moved me off of Taxotere to taxol because of the SE's.  Just a thought. Timbuktu, must be the weather.  I, too, am down.  Highly anxious is more like it as I have an appointment with the chair this afternoon.  No clue why it is hitting me so hard except on weekly it is tough to get mentally prepared like I did going every 2-3 weeks.  Wishing everyone a mentally good week.",

Please check with your MO on whether you must stay on Taxotere or if you can move to weekly taxol.  Believe me, there is a huge difference in SEs.  I couldn't handle Taxotere and was in the hospital for 4 days on IV with neupogen shots daily, terrible D and much of what you describe.  Moved to AC for 3 rounds which sounds horrible but much Better than. Nasty T.  Weekly taxol is a breeze in comparison, at least so far.  Don't suffer! We luv you!",

Well,I got the best birthday surprise today from my MO appointment before my taxol #7.  He said I'd didn't have to do the last cycle of 3 taxol.  So, I have two more weeks and I am DONE!  The first round of Taxotere makes up for the one cycle of taxol.  I had my required 4 rounds of cytoxan and the extra bonus of 3 adriamycin. Doc doesn't think their is any added benefit to continue past 9.  I am thrilled! I will start tami in September and stay on it until it is confirmed I am past menopause and move to an AI. So close! Even the dark place dpi am sure to be headed for tomorrow is not so dark! Wishing everyone the best!",
