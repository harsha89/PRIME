I had a ultrasound and after 25 min and 3 people trying to find the spots on the Mammo they did. He said it was irregular and I have to have a biopsy. The other one is round and he is notconcerned. I am so scared. He rated me a 4b on the biraid scale. My anxiety is bad I can't stop crying. I don't know any family history. They can't get me in for biopsy for a week. I am trying to stay focused but can't. Everyone keeps reminding me they are mostly benign but the irregular shape has me so freaked out. I feel awful many ofyou are diagnosed and I probably sound silly but my anxiety is awful Log in to post a reply",

I came here looking for support and information and found it when I needed it.My journey ended this afternoon with a call from my radiologist telling me my biopsy was benign. I am cancer free. I wanted to post this because I looked for these posts and found comfort with the posts that showed a higher biraid that still came back benign. This community is amazing and I was blessed to find y'all. I want to check in on this community and remain part. Y'all seen dear to my heart. Thank you Log in to post a reply",
