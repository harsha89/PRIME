I decided to pass on ACT (recommended by oncologist #1) as it seemed too agressive and I didn't like the office very much. The second oncologist recommended TC, 4 infusions, each 3 weeks apart. I had my first treatment July 16th, just over a week ago. Ditto to all the comments above, especially ones about constipation and water. Unfortunately I came down with a cold about 3 days after chemo. It seems to have compounded all the side effects (at least any flu like ones). I'm starting to feel better today at 10 days post. Did anyone else find the steroids a problem? I was buzzing on them, unable to sit still. Then felt a huge crash a day after they stopped.",

My first oncologist wanted to put me through 6 months of ACT, I understood that the Adriamycin can have long term effects on the heart (some of them showing up as far out as 10 years!) I consulted with a second oncologist who recommended the TC only, especially with an intermediate oncotype like mine. Thanks for the advice Sweeny; I will check out the Taxotere website.  I am now on day 2 post chemo #2, still feeling pretty good. The Dr. decided to phase out the steroids slowly to prevent the crash I had last time and hopefully control the rash/hives. So I am taking 16 mg the day before, IV steroids day of, 16 mg day after, then 8, then 4. I'll let you know if that helps with side effects. I know a bit more of what to expect now, started with treatments for constipation the day of chemo and am giving myself more time to rest. More water, avoid sugar, and alcohol (had a hair cutting ceremony 2 days after the first chemo and drank 2 classes of champagne....MISTAKE!). Now alcohol tastes like battery acid. My hair started coming out in clumps last Sat, so I had it shaved on Wednesday. I notice that I am loosing all peach fuzz on my face. Friends are commenting that my skin looks great. Small comfort.

I have not yet had the Nulasta shots and am hoping to avoid them. It is not standard practice at my oncologist's office when on TC therapy. They do a blood count the day before each treatment and make the decision at that time. You may want to put your post on the other forum (anyone on just T&C) as there are more folks who regularly check it. Some others on that thread recommend taking Aleve as it helps a lot. You may want to try it.  Wishing you a speedy recovery. Liz",

The day of chemo they gave me IV steroids and anti-nausea before TC. I have drugs for nausea, constipation, anxiety, and sleep...I'm a walking pharmacy at this point! Your irritation could very well be from the steroids, I felt that as well and understand it is a common side effect. Sleeplessness is also common. It takes a day or so to come down from the steroids...keep drinking water. My next infusion is this coming Thursday, # 2. Keep us posted as to how you are doing. From other posters I understand that days 3 to 5 post chemo can be the most difficult. I am now on week number 3 and feeling good, even gone back to my usual walking and gym program. Then, yesterday my hair started falling out. Although not unexpected, it was a surprise because I was feeling so good. Hang in there. All of us who go through this are heros. Being a hero is like taking an adventure, never comfortable at the time.",
