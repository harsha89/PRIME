We were very honest and straightforward about what had happened and what was going to happen. I told them that we would always be honest. They did not have to worry that things were worse than what we were telling them or that we were hiding information.   I also decided to let their teachers and guidance counselors know as well. I wanted to make sure they were supported at school, and I wanted to know if they were struggling.    My girls intially cried when we told them, but I was very matter-of-fact. I told them what stage my cancer was, what my next step(s) would be, and that they could be as much or little of a part of it as they chose.  We tried very hard to not make breast cancer the language of our lives. We took care of what needed to be done, but we kept everything as normal as possible.  ",

My oncologist treated me as a triple negative for chemo (4 rounds A/C, 4 rounds T), but put me on Aromasin for five years. I guess I'm in the middle, so she played both sides of the fence. She said that the Aromasin may not work for a large percentage of women like me, but the percentage was not zero that it might work. If I tolerated the side effects (which I can), it wouldn't hurt anything other than my pocketbook to try them.  From the onset, I said I would do ANYTHING to improve my odds of survival. I guess she heard me. :)",

I had mastectomy and hysterectomy and 8 rounds of AC/T. My left abdomen is enlarged. It is visibly noticeable. I have been watching it for a couple of months (I know, I know) but did not see my oncologist because I have absolutely no pain. The oncologist saw the enlargement, felt it and then said we needed to CAT scan it. He walked out of the office and push a rush on a CAT scan. They are working me in tomorrow. I am trying to tamp down the anxiety. Anyone ever heard of this? Thank you for sharing any insight you may have.",

If it is any consolation, I think of bc less often today than I did two years ago when I was diagnosed. Not a day goes by that it is not on my mind, but it isn't every minute or five minutes like it used to be. It's cliche, but it just takes time. My anxiety was the highest between diagnosis and treatment, and then again right after treatment finished. I sometimes felt \"stuck\". I couldn't make my mind move past bc. I obsessed over statistics, life expectancy calculators, and other things I read on the internet. It just made me bonkers. I had to make myself stay off the internet when the anxiety was high. I did not talk to others about my bc often. They didn't get it. They could nod their heads and empathize, but I knew deep down that unless you have had bc, you didn't get it. My daughters were teens, so we kept everything at home very, very normal. We didn't talk about bc much. I kept working, they kept their grades up and played sports, and we just muddled through. I did not seek outside help, but maybe it would have been beneficial. I didn't think I could connect with anyone who has not been on this journey.  I finally found someone via a friend who had bc. She was my safe person to spill out my anxiety and fear. She was a few years out from treatment, so she offered hope and perspective. She made the difference for me.  ",

I am 22 months from diagnosis, and I've been through so many \"ectomies\" ... lumpectomy, hysterectomy, mastectomy ... along with stage 1 DIEP reconstruction. It all feels like a whirlwind, and I wish I had this post in the early days when I was terrified, fearful and/or angry. One other piece of advice that I wish someone told me was to use the internet judiciously. I was BRCA1+ and er-/pr+. I spent many nights on the internet, and the statistics scared me silly. I was reading old research, looking at random sites, etc. It accomplished nothing other than to convince me that I was not going to survive. There is a light at the end of the tunnel. My worst time was right after my last chemo treatment when my medical oncologist said that she would see me in six months. I felt so alone, so adrift. It took a while before I really believed that I was through the worst and that I would survive. I'm a worrier...I just didn't know it before I was diagnosed. Keep on pushing through wherever you are in the journey. You can do whatever is put in front of you...one step, one moment, one day at a time... ",
