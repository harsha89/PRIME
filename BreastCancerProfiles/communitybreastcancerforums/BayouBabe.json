Patients who plan to undergo a prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy to avoid ovarian cancer should discuss the potential advantages and disadvantages of having a hysterectomy during the same procedure, according to data presented here at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 45th Annual Meeting on Women's Cancer. Researchers followed 525 women for an average of 6 years. All had a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation and had undergone risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO). During follow-up, 4 uterine cancers were diagnosed \u2014 all in women with a BRCA1 mutation. None of the women with a BRCA2 mutation developed uterine cancer. There were also no cases of low-risk disease (although 1.95 cases would be expected; P = .14). All 4 uterine cancers were high risk (1 serous, 1 high-grade serous with undifferentiated components, 1 carcinosarcoma, 1 leiomyosarcoma). \"Up to this time, we have thought it reasonable, but not required, to remove the uterus,\" said senior author Noah D. Kauff, MD, director of ovarian cancer screening and prevention for the gynecology service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. \"But it appears that women with BRCA1 mutations may have an increased incidence of high-risk uterine cancer after risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy that approaches 2.1% over 10 years,\" or an increase that is approximately 26-fold higher than in the general population. In this group, 2.2 uterine cancers would be expected, but instead there were 4.0, which is a doubling of the risk. \"This was slightly higher when compared with the general population, but it was not statistically significant,\" Dr. Kauff reported. Dr. Kauff emphasized that it is too early to suggest any changes to current practice. \"Given the study limitations, these data should be considered preliminary,\" he said. \"They require confirmation before any changes in clinical recommendations can be made.\" RRSO is associated with a decrease in risk for ovarian cancer of about 80% to 90% in women harboring BRCA mutations, and a decrease in risk for breast cancer of 40% to 70%. The effect of concomitant hysterectomy has not been established. Hysterectomy has its advantages and disadvantages, Dr. Kauff explained. \"It ensures complete removal of the fallopian tubes and can simplify hormone replacement therapy. It also eliminates a baseline risk of uterine cancer.\" On the downside, there is a higher risk for complications, higher cost, and longer surgical time. There have been no reported cases of cancer in the cornual portion of the fallopian tube after RRSO, he noted. High-Risk Disease With BRCA1 Mutations Dr. Kauff and his colleagues prospectively analyzed the risk for uterine cancer after RRSO. Of the 525 women evaluated, 296 (56%) had a BRCA1 mutation, 226 (43%) had a BRCA2 mutation, and 3 (0.6%) had both mutations. All had undergone RRSO but had an intact uterus. The women were followed with an annual questionnaire and medical record review. The researchers used age- and race-specific SEER data to determine the expected cancer incidence, and adjusted it for the prevalence of hysterectomy. Uterine cancer was categorized as low risk (endometrioid, mucinous, adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified) or high risk (serous, clear cell, sarcoma). The expected number of high-risk cases was 0.28. \"Instead, it was 4, and that was highly statistically significant,\" Dr. Kauff said. They occurred 1.4 to 12.9 years after surgery. One of the women had no history of breast cancer; the number expected would be 0.06 (P = .06). Three of the women had a history of breast cancer; the number expected would be 0.22 (P = .001). The researchers also looked at previous tamoxifen use, which is associated with an increased risk for endometrial cancer and endometrial changes. Two of the women with uterine cancer had previously used tamoxifen (expected, 0.092; P = .004), and 2 had not (expected, 0.184; P = .015). \"Women exposed to tamoxifen had a 22% increased risk,\" said Dr. Kauff. Table. Characteristics of the 4 Women With Uterine Cancer Routine Hysterectomy Not Recommended Yet This is \"definitely something that should be discussed with patients considering RRSO,\" said Stacey N. Akers, MD, from the Department of Gynecologic Oncology at Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, New York. However, \"we need further studies to determine risks so that we can counsel patients appropriately.\" The women in this study who developed endometrial cancer had type 2 endometrial cancers, which are more aggressive than type 1 endometrial cancers, she pointed out. \"Women with known BRCA1/2 mutations who opt for uterine preservation need to be aware of this,\" she told Medscape Medical News. They should \"be sure report any signs of bleeding to their care team.\" This \"is a good study,\" noted Steven Narod, MD, director of the familial breast cancer research unit at Women's College Research Institute in Toronto. \"The 4 cancers seen are interesting, but it is a small sample and is insufficient to guide practice,\" he said. However, several previous studies have suggested that tamoxifen causes these serous endometrial cancers. In fact, in a study 10 times larger than this one, Dr. Narod and his colleagues followed 4456 women with a BRCA1 or a BRCA2 mutation (Gynecol Oncol. 2013;130:127-131). They found that the risk for endometrial cancer was similar in women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation and in those in the general population. There was a significant increase in women who had breast cancer, but this was restricted to those who had used tamoxifen. Dr. Narod agrees that a hysterectomy should not routinely be recommended as a part of prophylactic surgery for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers. \"However, women should be made aware that they face a non-negligible risk of cervical and endometrial cancer, and that this can be eliminated through hysterectomy,\" he said.

I had my drains for just over a month - was putting out way too much drainage. So that could be part of what you are feeling. I also felt like my tissue expanders were in my arm pits and they did and still do drive me crazy. Remember that they are under your pec muscles and are stretching in ways they were never meant to be stretched. Once they relax a bit, you will get a bit of relief. Try and stay on top of the pain with your meds. This will help. I don't tolerate Vicodin well. Instead after the first few days I took ibuprofen and Tylenol. You can space the two meds apart, thus you are getting meds every few hours in alteration. Take it easy as well. Now is the time just to chill - take a nap, watch movies, read if you can concentrate (I couldn't). It will get easier. Give your body some time to adjust, as well as your heart and spirit!",

I stayed as well hydrated as I could; my rads center even had a fridge with drinks, as well as tea and coffee. I would drink tea or juice before I would let myself leave the rads center. I went bra less during rads to avoid irritation to my skin - I bought men's white tshirts, larger than normal so they were loose and wore those. I then waited almost 6 months after rads and had my exchange surgery AND fat grafting at the same time. My new breasts with implants look wonderful - including the rads side. You CAN do this!

I did not find out my results from the biopsies until approximately 48 hours later. Don't expect it that same day unless they have told you differently. Most doctors, in my experience, will not tell you anything about how it looks or feels. The most you will feel during the biopsy is the numbing shot. You may feel some pressure as they take the sample. You will be a bit sore afterwards, but nothing a small ice pack and some Tylenol won't help. I drove myself home from my second one. Your anticipation will be the worst of it. Be good to yourself in the upcoming days to distract yourself. Hoping for the best possible outcome for you!",

I am guessing this is what your friends and family are doing as well. It is not that they are dismissing your feelings, but, rather, protecting themselves a bit.

We would and still do have regular family sit downs where we update them and answer any questions, as well as remind them that we can discuss it at anytime. Most times they were satisfied with very simplistic discussions. I was/am amazed at their resiliency, ability to provide each other and me with comfort, and how they have stepped up to help out at home. My daughter asked to see the counselor at school, and saw her regularly last school year - it gave her a place to voice her fears/concerns without worrying about what I would think. Find someone like this for your son - family friend, relative, teacher, etc. It will help. Hopefully next week you will get the all clear and will no longer need to worry. If you need to, feel free to private message me - I would be happy to share some things I did or went through with my kids. It is definitely hard going through this with little ones at home!",

Remember you have to care for yourself first, as hard as this may be. Now is not the time to be too proud to ask for help (I am fiercely independent, and had an awful time with this. I know and get it). Have you thought about Meals on Wheels? Even a few meals a week is a great energy saver for you. What about hospice for your mom? As hard as this is, they have tremendous resources available. Friends, church members, neighbors? So many are eager to help if they just know what they can do. See if there is a social worker available where your mom gets care - they are wonderful at steering you in the right direction for help and services. The more help you get for her care, the more you can focus on YOU! The wait for tests is the hardest. In a perfect world we would all get in the next day - imagine the stress it would save. Be good to yourself now and find and do things to help you relax as best you can and make the time pass. Hugs to you and your mom!",

I have since had a BMX (cancer was only on the left). I also had my ovaries removed. My children will be tested when they are older. I have one cousin who tested after my diagnosis and was negative. I just sent the info to two other cousins today. The decision is now in their hands.",

During radiation I was having a touch of swelling. Got measured at a lymphedema clinic (had baseline prior to surgery). It showed 3 % swelling. They taught me MLD. They also measured me for a sleeve and glove. Sleeve fits fine. Glove - had two different ones, neither worked. Got sent for a custom one. Just received my 2nd custom and it is still giving me problems. Thus, 4 gloves, and still not one that fits. Out of frustration I ordered a gauntlet from Lymphadivas - they had a grab bag sale and thought I had nothing to lose. Got the gauntlet today and love it. But now I am wondering if there is a reason I need the glove instead of the gauntlet? Don't want to cause myself more issues. I had asked at my last appointment at LE clinic, why I needed one over the other, and the therapist just looked at me like I sprouted wings. (Not fond of this clinic, but it is all that is accessible to me). Ugh. Is a gauntlet ok? Also - I do not need it every day - have been fine so far just wearing sleeve/glove when my arm feels full/aches, or when exercising. Please help. LE is starting to cause me to lose my mind!

Even if you decide not to test, be sure to keep all regular doctor visits, keep an eye on your birads score, do monthly breast exams, and trust your gut if you think something is out of the ordinary. You know your body best. Even with BRCA testing, I am sure there are numerous \"cancer\" genes that have yet to be discovered.
