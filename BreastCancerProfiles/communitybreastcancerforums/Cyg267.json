I'm having neoadjuvant chemo : 4 rounds of AC every 2 weeks and then 12 weeks of taxol every week. I had my first infusion on Friday (no port) and while it was nerve-wracking before it started, suppose it wasn't too bad. Now I'm waiting for the neulasta shot to go off \"sometime in 27 hours\". I had goals of taking walks outside if I could, but it's been so humid in PA! Running around after my 4 and 6 year old girls have helped me to stop waiting around for side effects to kick in, but it's hard to stop thinking about it when people constantly ask me how ask I feel. One difference in what I've seen so far is my MO did not recommend taking ibuprofen or acetaminophen for joint pain because it might mask fevers. She prescribed tramadol. Also I have teeth prone to cavities. When my dentist found out about the chemo, he immediately insisted on prescribing prevadent and brushing after every meal. He says he sees a lot of patients with cavities after chemo because of the dry mouth. Hope these tips help someone as much as allyour previous posts have helped me! I'm also curious on how my signature comes out after my post - it was hard for me to edit in that tiny box!",
