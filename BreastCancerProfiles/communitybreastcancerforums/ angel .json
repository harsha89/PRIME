The doctor at the screening center said that it was nothing and very common in women my age and that it could be left alone. I haven't gone to see my doctor following the results though and I am afraid she might suggest removing it. My mother had a fibroadenoma in her 30's and removed it with surgery. She suggests I leave it alone and monitor it regularly as the surgery itself causes pain and leaves a big scar. I am still weighing my options and would absolutely have it removed if the doctor informed me of any danger of having fibroadenomas. My aunt who was recenly diagnosed with BC at 49, also had a fibroadenoma when she was my age. However, other than her case,  there is no other family history of any cancers in my family, but this also has me worried. My question is are fibroadenomas a precursor to BC? Does having an aunt with BC put me at higher risk? Have any of you had fibroadenomas in the past and how have you managed them? I know I have a lot of questions but I admit my diagnosis as well as my aunt's diagnosis has gotten me worried. Any advice would be extremely appreciated! Log in to post a reply",

Crunchy, bet you'd hate being me walking around with only one nipple, and a fake one at that!  Sometimes I do wish I'd have just not bothered and could feel the liberty of being breastless. ",

Does having breast cysts put you at higher risk for developing cancer in the future? The reason I ask is cause my aunt who had cysts in the past was just diagnosed with Breast Cancer at 49. We have no previous family history of cancer. I was wondering if the cysts are an indication of genetic breast cancer? Should I be worried? Any advice is appreciated! Log in to post a reply",

Every thing on that list except apples and grits make me feel sick so the list is in a folder. I know we all have different things going on so different regiments call for more extreme measures I am sure to avoid complications.  There is a real sad face nurse who advocates for the BC patients where I am at who comes in to help break down what the doctors say. When I asked my MO what could I eat he said I am not restricting you right now, then I said can I still teach pole fitness he said if you feel up to it you can do what your body tells you. After he left the sad face nurse came back in and said, \"you may want to take a break from the pole for awhile, it's probably not good for you to be flipping around\".  I had to laugh.

It seems we have run the gambit on emotions and physical issues since before Thanksgiving, but that is to be expected. I am glad I got to enjoy all the food I wanted this time, I think it was more of I savored every bite this time instead of just stuffing myself. I only ate what I wanted, which was mostly starches. Today is my birthday and I am one day post #3 infusion which is usually and okay day it just with the anti nausea medicine I am so slow an sleepy. If I sit still I am out, and having to sit up 2 hours after I take it makes it hard to nap like I want but if I lay down I find I start coughing and wake myself up as if something is stuck in my throat. I also noticed yesterday during the infusion I was starting to cough a lot, not sure if it was the port or not but I finally got it under control and it went a bit faster, although I have decided I like early morning. Too many sour puss faces late afternoon. I had a 76 year old man come up to me when he was done and say \"you are the happiest face I see in here smiling, nodding at people and listening to your music while filling out Christmas cards, what a treat\". I have folks sending me gift certificates for the spa and fixing me meals and dropping them off. I don't even know if I can use the gift certificate now with the treatments and just between us, not everyone is a good cook but I don't know how to tell folks not to do. I know they just want o feel helpful anyway they can and I just try to remember that just because I am fine without all the fuss and hoop la, they may not be and that's why they keep doing. I have my consultation with the plastic surgeon tomorrow morning so one more doc to add the list of many that I now see. When the nurse was taking my blood yesterday she was saying it's rare to run across someone as healthy as me no health issues, no medications, etc. and I broke out laughing. I told her I use to be as healthy as a bowl of grits, now I tote around a black book with all my meds, doctor information, appointments and business cards for all the people I see to mention some of the diagrams the doctors have written out that is the size of a phone book (for those of you who remember a phone book). I feel anything but healthy knowing they are pumping poison into my body on a regular basis and my body knows and doesn't like it, and knowing that eventually we are cutting it out. The MO came in and checked me out and could no longer feel the lump an asked me had I felt it in two weeks, another bout of laughter from me as I pointed out to him I never felt it the first time, my husband did. So I guess the chemo is working to shrink it and may even make it non existent. I shall keep you all posted, one more round of this on December 12th, then on to the next 8 weeks of the journey. I think I may have been a bit ambitious wanting to participate in the Pole Competition in June, but we all have to look ahead at something. Better days are coming. My work partner sent me \"Dear God, They say It's Caner a companion guide for women on the breast cancer journey\" by Janet Thompson has anyone else read it?",

I noticed my eyebrows are very thin and appear to be getting thinner and considering I had to get them done before to keep from looking like a bush woman its kind of funny. As for the soy products, I had a nutritionist before this and when I told her about the bc and asked about food restrictions she did say to stay away from soy. Chinese is my favorite and I love sushi, but I have made small adjustments to have things prepared without but its more of a pain going out so I have fired up the wok and bamboo steamer at the house to take the edge off. Leto, I have found that a cup of coffee every morning, along with a bran cereal with extra fruit in it seems to keep me from having the stomach issues, but if I miss it like over the weekend it comes back with a vengeance. I am not a big coffee drinker but now that have found something that works with movement I will keep at it. How are folks doing with hot flashes, I am a minute away from stripping naked about every 30 minutes it use to be more at night, now its on and off all day.",

Everything taste funny, people keep dropping by the house bringing food that I can't really taste unless its over seasoned. I know they are doing what they can so I don't want to say stop, and at least my husband gets to try new things. Since I am still mobile and able to cook I find it a bit strange to have people sending food or bringing food. Maybe after surgery it would make more sense.

I got the news the end of September and that day I felt like I was gut punched when I walked out of the surgeons office after the bombarded my husband and I with so much information I couldn't see straight. I walked into the bathroom came back out and met him in the hallway and fell apart for all of 5 minutes, we just cried and held each other, after that I went to O'Charleys and had 4 straight whiskey shots and went and told my family. It took a few weeks but the calm set in, my husband and I have been growing our faith for some time now and once I realized that this is a test to strengthen it all the worry went away along with the anxiety. I spend more time trying to calm the worry of my mother and younger sisters who want me to just sit and do nothing. I have always been a planner and this was not in my plan so it has been an adjustment and those days when my energy level is not turbo like it usually is it frustrates me and the emotions are all over the board. I have always been curvy with great hair, now the things that I thought were me are being adjusted, the hair is gone, the boobs are soon to be gone and replaced it's not anything that I thought, but I guess it is to be what it is suppose to be. We just keep living, my husband and I are both in law enforcement so there are rotating shifts and call outs and trying to work some to conserve some of your sick days for when you really need them is a task but he has been at all my appointments even when he is coming off night shift. The last time he was asleep in the uncomfortable chair while I was crocheting getting my cocktail, he just wants to be there and even though I tell him I am fine to drive myself which I am and have done he insists. I know it makes him feel good and he says if he could take it away he would, but I know even if I could give it to him I would not. My chemo bag has my favorite blanket made for me by a friend, one of my pillows, crosswords, and my crochet I also have my tunes and where I go has tvs so I watch that to. I even took a little nap the first time with my ear buds in. I like to have shoes in which I can slide in and out of so I can get comfy when I let the chair back. It is a journey but so many have made it and been able to testify to it and we will too. When you feel overwhelm remember we are all here for one another.",

Work is a ghost town and all is quiet in the city, if it was not for the fact that I am sucking up all my sick time and vacation time with treatments I would have taken it off too. I did make it to the studio last night for a workout. I was a little tired when I got there but once I started moving I felt so much better, I soaked in Epson salt and jumped up my regular time this morning for prayer and reading but I do feel a bit tired and my eyes feel dry but look watery.  I think I will try the tear stuff to see if it makes a difference. Normally I stay around the house for Thanksgiving if my husband is on  shift and just have Chinese food and watch movies but my mom seemed adament that I drive the 20 minutes to her house this year for what our family considers to be a gathering. We are such a hodge podge, family members just comes and go throughout the day fixing a plate from the buffet she sets out so it's not like we all sit down together and eat. I figured since she seems to be worried that I am not eating, I should make an appearance so she and my sisters can see that I am doing fine and looking well. I got on the scale this morning and have gained 5 pounds in two weeks, I see why the greasy food keeps me from being nauseated, it doesn't go anywhere its just sitting around making me fat. :-) But I will happily take that over being nauseated and sick so I am thankful for that and thankful for having stumbled upon this discussion board. When I was given the news and went online looking at everything I could find I was so lost. I would come to the site everyday reading what people were saying and doing afraid to join in because it would make it too real. I thought if I kept it to myself it would be so much easier, I am so glad I finally said something. Its so much easier talking with people who have an understanding of what is going on. \"..all things work together for good to those who love God..\"Romans 8:28",

Bills are always going to be there so if you get a moment and can take a little time to enjoy a little vacation, go for it.

So far I have seen a beautiful sunrise, hit a deer on the way to work, went for a walk on my fitness break and was extremely winded and have a pile of work on my desk. It's a good day!",

It put me in peek rush hour traffic, and my husbands car did not have as much gas as I thought but I made it to the location with a few minutes to spare. I go in and find out the class was cancelled because the facilitator had the flu and they had been trying to call people all day to reschedule, of course I did not get a call. As I left the gas light came on in the car, it was just too funny. I may try to go again but that was such a let down after I had been looking forward to it, I don't know if I want to wait an entire month again to see what happens, not to mention I need some eyebrow help now. So youtube here I come. I did notice during my infusion session Friday they had the email address for the person setting up the classes so I may send her an email to see if February is full yet.",

I have been having flashes even worse and Friday will make two weeks since the last treatment and I am still only sleeping 3 1/2 hours. I find that one Tylenol pm and a light toddie with a squirt of adult beverage gives me a full 5 hours. I tried not doing it that way last night just the toddie no pill, I was up in 2 hours and tossed and turned all night which made for a trying day since I had a 3 1/2 hour drive back from the conference. I have a little peach fuzz on the back of my head, the wild thing is that at night when I have those flashes my head becomes super hot, the pillow even gets hot. I feel like Drew Barrymore in Firestarter. I was having a meeting with my partner when I got back to work today and I swear in the span of 20 mins I took off and put on my sweater 5 times just because I would go hot, cold, hot, cold, hot, cold. Last week I went in my office dead bolted the door and laid on the sofa in my underwear until I stopped sweating. I feel like I am about to jump out my own skin. I know it will pass as will the sore fingers but when you are going through it you just want to scream. Now I am reading about the scans, and us triple negatives are more prone to getting them? I wonder if that is if you are getting radiation. Since the 5 lymph nodes they took were clear although clearly in distress and I am having a double mastectomy the MO said no radiation needed especially with the tumor completely going away feeling the chemo would take care of the rest. I will be doing some additional research, as always reading the posts are always informative.",

They are right everyone reacts differently to treatment. I have been working still and am a crime scene investigator, I actually had to do the police fitness test the day after they told me I had cancer, and I had to shoot for certification a week after they took 5 lymph nodes out of my left armpit. It has been a bit uncomfortable at times and when I get too hot I tend to feel nauseous but for the most part other than being constipated and a bit dizzy I have been getting through. The ever constant headaches after the infusion were a bit much, I found that I was trying to tough it out but when they have such great medicines there is no need to be in pain when you don't have to be. I have tons of information on natural herbal remedies that a friends mother who went through this years ago used and sent to me and I have a great oncologist. I am willing to try the herbs in conjunction at this point but not as the treatment. I think it is good to have as much information as possible to decide what is best for you. The type of cancer I have responds best to chemo, that is why I went with it. Advances in medicine have made things better and more effective but then again I am looking at treatments until March. For the amount a treatments you are looking at there may be a better option, keep focusing on what you need to do for you and what gives you peace of mind.  ",

When I asked could I shave my arms and legs, he said yes however you will lose the hair there so you don't need to. I wanted to know when would I lose my head hair. He was not evasive he said Day 16 is when hair starts to fall out, since I wear wigs sometimes to switch it up I have plenty. I have just never worn one with no hair.

The bills are mounting, let them mount they can't get blood out of a turnip, the #1 thing is that you get better, you have people that are depending on you to get better to be there to talk to, to console to laugh. There are services out there that can help with cost, I know its hard for you without a family support system nearby but enlist your local Christian charity groups. My doctors office had payment plans for financial issues and as they told me, it will get paid one way or the other. There is always more than one way to skin a cat, it may take a bit of time and a lot of emails and phone calls but it's easier when you are at home. When you feel like crap it is easy to say I am tired and I want to be done, but this is not your fight. God fights for us all, he wants us all to be drawn closer to him and although we may never understand why this befell upon us there is a reason for it. There is someone watching and listening and taking what we say as the law because it's all they have to hold on to because they are going through the same things except they are signed on like I was and afraid to engage. We are helping and supporting more than just the one's who post a reply. There are days when I am exhausted, depressed and it hurts to touch me but I refuse to let the enemy make me think I am ready to give up. I dreamed the other night that I was Wonder Woman, the strangest dream in a while but I took that to mean I am stronger than I think and got up with a bit of renewed energy...for all of 4 hours before I needed a nap. There was a moment that I thought it would be easier to walk out in the surf and let the water engulf me when I first found out that I had this thing growing in me. I stood on that beach for a long time, my husband had gone to the store and I had no one keeping a watch over me it just seemed so easy but as I watched the water and it continued to mesmerize and relax me as it always does I had this total since of calm and peace and I heard in my head \"calm your mind and turn your worries over to me, I am here and have been here all along\" that was my turning point with worrying about the things with this. I still get anxious moments here and there when I get denial of claims from my insurance or when I see another letter coming in, but I can't worry with that and won't as I remind myself it's going to work itself out with our without me. As my husband says there is nothing else until I am better he could give a hoot about what is stacking up. I will continue to pray that you see a movement soon that restores your sense of balance physically, mentally and emotionally. \"Come to me all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give your rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart and you will find rest for your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light\" Matthew 11:28-30 \"Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be frightened, and do not be dismayed for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.\" Joshua 1:9  ",

I am anxious to get started with treatment on Friday so I can get through this cycle, reading about some of the SE's folks have had make me a bit apprehensive, but  I will remain positive that this too shall pass. Looking forward to a New Year and a new me at some point during this new year. Congratulations to all those who have completed their treatments, gives me hope.",

I have number 6 treatment tomorrow so from what I see from the taxol, the SE's last all week and then I get another treatment. Becca it is good to see the humor in this, I know I do. Some of these posts have kept me sane these pass few months since getting on this merry-go-round that I didn't know I was going to ride. Sjacobs146, I hear you about the taste, the last treatments took them away but remember this too shall pass. Now I have super smell and can taste again, but last night at the Italian restaurant someone fish dish from another part of the restaurant sent me gagging to the restroom. Tomorrow will be interesting since I was told to tell the nurse that the bandage they put over my port makes me nauseous because it smells very antiseptic. I was told by the other nurse last week they can cover it with tape and gauze and not use it if it bothers me. I hate to be a bother when I go in, I just sit and go with the flow but since I would hate to lose my breakfast I think I better say something. On a lighter note I finally got into one of those Look Good Feel Better sessions that are always full around here. I actually called the 1-800 number the first of December because the one's here were booked for the past 2 months and they said that someone from the center would call me in January to ensure I got into a class. So January 20th I am there at 6pm, such good timing since I have bags under my eyes, my skin is super dry, and my eyebrows are fading into my face. Putting on powder, swiping on mascara, and lip balm is all I know how to do, drawing in eyebrows is way too advanced for me. They even help with wig styling so I am a bit excited. My wigs are super easy with a bit of frutese in a spray bottle with water I spray and style but then again I style it the same way so some variety would be nice. I have five different versions of the one I wear in case I want to change it up a little on the weekend, my husband says walking in the closet and seeing all the mannequin heads fully made up with wigs on them does take some getting use to. lol  ",

It seems to have been one of those weeks, then we had ice on Wednesday that caused all kinds of chaos. I taught a lap dance class Tuesday night at 8:30pm an although I made it through the class I had a hot flash that drenched me down to the skin, when I got home my legs and arms were so fatigued I could barely lift them. I woke up with the worse headache, called out sick and slept in all day got up at 5pm yesterday had my husband take me out for Thai came back home and went back to sleep until this morning at 5:45 when I got up to pray and read....and I still feel tired. I have never slept that long. I know they said I would be tired, but I just assume just tired not exhausted. I guess it is time to cut back a bit, but I am already only teaching about every other week and just feel like with the steroids I am becoming so heavy. The doctors office called Tuesday to say they have scheduled surgery for March 19th pending no issues with the remainder of my chemo. I think I should feel relieved but I just feel like it's another thing that I will have to recover from. Anyway tomorrow is treatment #7 more than half way done, I should be feeling excited. I will let you know when I get the excitement. lol Have a good weekend ladies, we deserve it.",

Mine did not fall off however they all turned black, and are still black hence why I keep them painted right now. They are super sensitive and hurt, I can' t button clothes or hook jewelry. A friend advised hers fell off and they changed her meds. It can't hurt to ask the oncologist,they have made such strides with the meds now. If nothing else you can opt for the Michael Jackson look and tape up all the tips, just put a bandaid on before to pad the fingers. I think he said it was an Asian good luck thing, but mayhaps he was having a health issue too.",
