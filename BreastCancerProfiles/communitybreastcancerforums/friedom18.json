I decided onthe scourched earth approach to dcis. I felt that I am not guarenteed to be on the right side of any statistic, and I did not want to spend years on a drug that would make my unrelenting menopausal symptoms that much worse. I received wonderful support from most of my family, though my sibling was not able to put my feelings before hers. Recovery has been pretty difficult. I have failed at pain management- morphine and dilaudid did not touch the pain but made me nauseated. Phentynol pump was ok with the anti-nausea med. Tylenol makes me feel the most functional. I have yet to really sleep, so that is something to look forward to. Tomorrow I go to the breast surgeon for my first post op visit, and to get pathology report. Everyone insists the sentnal node is almost always negative. I hope they are right. Friday to the plastic surgeon for his exam. Would love to hear your experiences. Thanks.",
