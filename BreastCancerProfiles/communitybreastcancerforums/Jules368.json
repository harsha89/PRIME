Eyelashes continue to fall out too, so there are only about 3 on each side....grrrr. I've read other posts of people that were on dose dense that didn't start to show signs of anything growing until about 8 weeks...how frustrating",

I've seen so many pictures of ladies that have the top of their head growing much slower than the sides and back. Don't worry, it will all come back. Mine is is just barely sprouting on the top where the bangs should be...which is about two weeks slower than the rest of my head. As far as eyebrows and lashes, well the 2 or 3 that were still hanging on fell out two weeks ago which was 5 weeks post chemo, and everything is already filling in nicely. I think the top lashes will definitely take the longest...but I bet they will be to full-length within a month. Since your hair already started growing, you are doing great. I was shiny bald until exactly 5.5 weeks post chemo and it's amazing how quickly it starts to fill in once it decided to grow! I've been taking 10,000mg of Biotin each day too. Take care",

Thank you for the tip about the eyebrows..I will be stopping at the MAC counter to check it out this week. That's funny about the zombie -- I told my husband the other day that I look like an alien. My bottom lashes are already starting to come in though.....yay! Hair or no hair, I would do it all again to be sure I had done what was needed to get rid of any nasty little cells floating around! Have a great day, girls ",
