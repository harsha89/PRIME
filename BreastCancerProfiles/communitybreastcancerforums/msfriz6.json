I also feel blessed God chose this path for me.  So much growth can be obtained through suffering.  I and those connected to me, have the potential to learn numerous lessons.  I hope and pray we are opened to hear, see and understand that which we are to learn. Miss_Lolli ~ Thanks for the comment.  I can see what a supportive group this is.  It's awesome!  Yep, I kind of felt like a fish out of water, with no one to relate to that is going through similiar situations.  Until now, that is.  What kind of puppy to you have?  We have a Border Collie as she helps us work cattle.  It's amazing how much natural instinct they have.  Hope you can get out to the park again, soon! Kara ~ Thanks for the link.  I highly doubt I would've found it on my own.  I haven't really looked around much, yet.  The link is full of useful information!  Enjoy Ratatouille, what a fun movie. My kids and I loved it!  Congrads on #3!!  Stay strong. TexanKaren ~ Thanks for the welcome!  45 min. is still a lot longer than most people, I imagine.  I love living in a rural community (pop. 200) as it's a great place to raise kids, but it does have it's downfalls as everything is so far away.  OMG, 30 chairs???  My center has 10.  I can't even imagine!  I will keep you in my prayers for safe traveling! carpediempenny ~ Ahhh, a fellow TAC-er!!  I go for my 2nd tx on the 20th.  Wow, still working through all this?  You have GUTS!  Do you think your 2nd round was like the first??  I can't help but wonder how it will go... better... worse??  Any words of advice?? mrs7148 ~  I think our schedules are within a couple days of each other.  My #2 is on Nov., 20 and I should finish on Feb., 12!!  Are you on TAC, as well?  Amazing you metioned the Ozarks.  We took our family vacation there this past summer, renting a 65' houseboat.  We had a blast!  Nice area, but I understand your reservations about getting good medical care.  Congradulations to your dh's remission!!  I'd say, you guys have had more than your share of 'speed bumps'!  My hats off to you!  You mentioned your wbc being 13.8 - mine went from 1.9 (6 days post 1st tx) to 27.5 (10 days post).  I knew the Neulasta was supposed to boost the wbc production, but I had no idea it would blast it off the chart!  Hope your platelets rise soon! Day 14 (post #1) - I feel well, but tired.  I really shouldn't complain because I think I am getting off easy as far as SE.  But, it is hard to lie low when I am used to being on the go.  Still very much enjoy playing the violin (began 1 yr ago) and have pulled out a bunch of Christmas music in preparation for playing in the choir at Church.  I play each weekend, but Christmas is such a special time!  Hopefully, this year my kids will join me.  One child plays the alto sax - another the trombone & guitar - another the clarinet, flute, & violin - another the banjo - another the violin - and the last a chello that is tuned like a bass violin.  I LOVE hearing music in the house.  It warms my soul! Have a good week, ladies!! ",

That being said, my husband of 18 years did attemp to talk me into getting the 'Dolly Parton' look.  I told him, surgery wouldn't end there bc I would need 'butt augmentation, otherwise I would be falling on my nose.  Yea, I am sure from his point of view, it'd be nice.  But in my mind, my breasts or lack-there-of, never defined me as me.  So, no thank you. Karen1956 ~ Your post caught my eye as I see you are from Denver.  That's where I go for tx (live 3.5 hours away, though).  Do you by any chance go to the Cancer Care Center at Porter Hosp?  I am heading back for #2 on the 20th.  Oh, and I saw a great PS that I'd highly recommend.  Could maybe get you in before Jan., if you are interested?? Peace and strength to all ~ ",
