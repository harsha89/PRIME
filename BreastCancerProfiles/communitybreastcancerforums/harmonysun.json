I was thinking that if I had didn't have positive nodes that I probably wouldn't need chemo. But now I see that could be different. I am ER+, 45 and grade 2. So.......          Are you doing tamoxifen or something too? where are you in your treatment? I love the name otter-why did you choose that?

Did you have chemo? I thought that is generally with pos nodes or large tumors?   thanks, brenda",

The more I thought about it, I realized I never want to go through this again if at all possible, so I called him and said I wanted to do a bilateral mast. He was great and I guess puts it to the insurance as reduction of risk. I did not do recon, and I am so happy with all the decisions I made. It is a very personal decision for everyone to make. I did prepare myself mentally beforehand, it is still a little sad to face any kind of loss of our body, but life goes on and that is all i wanted. To be healthy and go on taking care of my children (I am 45 and they are 4 and 6). If I would have had the lump I would have had to have rad for 8 weeks and also been on tamox. for 5 yrs. I am 100% satisfied with my decision. take care, brenda",

I am really torn about this. good luck with everything!",

They removed 15 nodes from the cancer side and 2 from the other, all neg, thankfully. The oncologist said the cancer was so small I would not need any further treatment.        Well now there is a half orange size mass under my armpit, I had felt something hard there 10 days after surgery and it is now 8 weeks and it seems to be pretty firm and much larger. Is it a seroma, does a seroma feel softer? could it be scar tissue or something else? it feels like a firm area, not fluid like. any shared exprience would be very much appreciated. thank you!

I am doing great 2 months after the surgery and I am very happy with my decision. Especially that I avoided rads and tamoxifen which i would have had to have if i had a lumpectomy. Then the constance surveillance, biopsys, etc, and I just never wanted to go through this again, I had to do what I could. I had great breasts and am just so grateful I breastfed my kids with them. I don't know if I will ever to recon, don't want to go through more surgery if it is not for my life. Each person and situation is different, but I am happy with my decision to do a bilat. take care, brenda",
