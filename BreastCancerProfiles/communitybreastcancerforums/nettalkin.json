My question is has anyone ever heard of this and what you may know, for some reason either all the doctors I have seen this past 2 weeks live in a box or just don't want to say. I am having surgery the 20th to have this removed which the surgeon asked me if I wanted to have it done OMG someone please help me. Log in to post a reply",
