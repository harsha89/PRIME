I did purchase 1 of the bandeau bras Erica suggested but my inserts are to heavy so gonna have to look into purchasing the light weight ones for future occasions (NEVER agreeing to be a bridesmaid again tho). Thanks Erica for the link. mthomp2020 - I'm 1 of 6 bridesmaids and don't want to be singled out, but you do have some great ideas + Thanks for supporting me. The bride and the rest of the bridesmaid were there for me when I was going thru it all, but now that it's been 2 yrs they seem to think I'm over it or should be over it by now. Well as only the ones that have experienced it know, it's not a forgetable experience. Think maybe I need to visit this site waay more often. Love the feeling knowing I'm not alone. Thanks again for all your suggestions.",

Thought it was gonna work but I'm too scared that it's gonna slip down. Has anyone tried the TLC reusable self adhesive silicone support strips? My other idea was to go buy a corset and sew in my forms with elastic bands.  Log in to post a reply",

I tried on some strapless swimming suits that had inserts for pads the other day (not for ladies with mastectomies) and that wasn't working cause the pocket isn't big enough for my inserts. Did not look pretty. The dress also goes down to mid back so I don't think the ABC strapless bra would work. A friend and I are gonna get together tomorrow and try to figure out something. I might end up with duct tape around my chest to keep them where they are supposed to be. Told the bride I did not want to be a bridesmaid and now I'm wishing I would of stuck with it. Didn't want to hurt her feelings but still upset that they picked out strapless dress when they know my situation. Maybe I'm just feeling sorry for myself. Thanks for listening.. :) I'll try to get around to posting pics when I get it figured out.",
