It is no longer felt by touch, but I assume perhaps it will still show on ultrasound. I haven't had any follow-up scans yet. Does anyone have any similar experiences? I don't know what to think.",

I have a scarf that I wore to the grocery store yesterday just to help myself get more comfortable with my new look. I am going out to eat with the in-laws on Wednesday so that will be another scarf opportunity. I agree with what you said about pity. Most people know that I am going through treatments but I don't want to be seen as \"the cancer patient\" all the time either. Julia",

It really is a lot more comfortable and I think it has helped me feel more in control. I guess if I am going to be bald at Christmas, it should be on my own terms! On a related note, I did wear my wig for the first time out and about in public today. I don't know why, but I felt like I was doing something really secretive.

The Ugly - Apparently Taxol hates me. Six minutes into the transfusion my blood pressure fell to 80/50 and I passed out. I woke up with oxygen in my nose and the medical team standing over me. It looked a lot scarier than it turned out to actually be. They upped my steriods and Benadryl, observed me for around 30 minutes, and then continued the infusion. Everything went smoothly after that. I don't know if this will change my treatment plan or not. Sorry for the venting post.

It was tender enough that I used scissors to open ketchup packets at lunch. I know that some people lose their nails while on Taxol, but would one dose cause side effects already? Am I just crazy? ha ha I hate to complain because I have been doing great through chemo so far. Thanks in advance.",

I have been lucky not to have too many side effects, but I am constantly worried that I am going to knock it off or damage it in some way while I am wearing it.",
