I went in because I have a lump that has caused puckering on the lower inside side of my breast. I went for an u/s today and they weren't able to see the lump but both the tech and radiologist could feel it with their fingers and when they rolled over it. The radiologist seemed very annoyed and said its probably just normal breast tissue. Are there normal conditions that cause a new lump to form? With puckering? Log in to post a reply",
