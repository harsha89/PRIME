EACH & EVERYONE of you looks AMAZING!! just a few random comments about various posts i've read... 1 - do not fear if the top is not filling in - in my experience it fills in very slow. mine looks less full when it's wet & i'm 16wks PFC 2 - nails - i lost 4 fingernails after they lifted & one toenail. i thought it would take 6 months or more to look normal but it only took 3 months. i take Biotin, BioSil & drinks tons of water so that may have helped 3 - hair dye... i dyed my hair ASAP. my ONC said it was safe and i was tired of looking like an old man. i say go for it if your ONC is OK (most are) 4 - i ran (on the treadmill) for the first time Sunday since last October. it was FANTASTIC!! i was really nervous because i still have expanders in but to my delight it didn't hurt a bit. i felt MUCH better after too :) happy day to all!!!   ",
