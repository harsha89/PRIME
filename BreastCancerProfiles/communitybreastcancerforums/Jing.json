I had a BMX on May 24th and I also have hypersensitive skin.  It does slowly go away but in the meantime, the best solution for me is to wear some kind of compression garment over my chest so that any fabric can't rub the skin.  Initially I used a sports bra but now I found out that a rashguard shirt works even better since I don't need a bra (no reconstruction) and it doesn't rub my drain hole scars!  With the rashguard on, I can wear a lightweight outer shirt for going to the store, etc...  I imagine that one of the compressive Armour Heatguard shirts would also work. Hope you feel better soon. ",

There are lots of reasons for not wanting to do any reconstruction.  First, I already have neuropathy and my doctors can't agree as to what is causing it.  (I had the neuropathy before surgery and I have not had any chemo or rads.)  Second, my boobs were painful due to excessive swelling during each period.  Then to make things worse, I have periods every 25 days so most of the month, my breasts hurt - yes, I tried Midol, etc...  Finally, I have the most uneven chest I've ever seen on a female.  If I had done reconstruction, I don't see how I would not end up really lopsided - even if I wore foobs, it would be hard to make things look right. Speaking of foobs, I do not even want to wear any foobs and I agree with Lena, no bras for the rest of my life!  My new normal is to finally be comfortable and not in pain. The only problem I have is that my chest skin is very sensitive and I can't stand wearing a lot of shirts due to irritating seams or what seems like rough fabric.  (Neuropathy can make you hypersensitive in weird ways.)  So, I've been wearing a rashguard or Under Armour compression tee.  If I need to cover up (i.e. not look like I'm running a triathalon), I just put on any lightweight shirt over it.   Life is good!",

Kmpod:  I'd push for the surgeon to make your scar as flat and smooth as possible.  If you are left with the skin flaps, most ladies find them irritating especially if you will still need to wear a bra due to being only a unilateral mastectomy.  As for dog ears, that can occur at the end of the mastectomy scar nearest the armpits.  Basically it occurs because the chest curves the most there so if the surgeon is not careful, he or she may not be able to get the skin to lay flat there and you end up with a sort of pucker.  Whether or not residual fat contributes to this problem, I think it all depends on where the fat is and where the surgeon wants to end the incision.  You need to discuss this with your surgeon.  Good luck with your surgery!",

So here's a funny solution.  Hubby and I were at Kroger's the other day and of course I had to go to the bathroom.  So we go towards the restrooms and there is \"Men's\" on the left, \"Women's\" on the right, and in the middle, \"UNISEX\"!  \"They built a bathroom just for you,\" says hubby!  I'm so glad he's taking my BMX so well.  BTW, thanks Barbe1958 and Firebird.  Your previous postings here have helped me a lot.  The hypersensitivity of my chest skin is betting a bit better each day...  At this rate, I'll be able to wear standard button-down-the-front shirts by Christmas! ",

Anyway, my DH also loves my new slimmer profile as he calls it.  I actually look better now after the surgery than before - sad but true.  Give yourself time.  I've been out in public a lot and no one seems to notice at all, really.  Carry yourself proudly because you just survived a BMX and that is no small thing!",
