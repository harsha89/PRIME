I know I gained a lot of strength and wisdom from everyone on these boards when I was navigating my way through the breast cancer journey when I was first diagnosed. Life was moving beyond breast cancer (well I thought it was..) I'd nearly hit 3 years post diagnosis last week (same week I was rediagnosed). I found out last week I have 3 spots on my lungs, and one on a lymph node behind my sternum.I had some scans, as we wanted to try and start a family and my oncologist was encouraging and supportive of this, it was not what we were hoping for (an understatement!). My breast suregon said the \"spots\" are small, just able to be picked up on PET scan. I will be seeing my Oncologist Thurs to discuss treatment options. I was triple negative first time. This is a grey area given I am feeling really well and had it not been for some elected scans due to wanting to start a family, we don't know how long it would have been before symptoms presented. For now, just trying to focus on the moment. Somewhere, somehow I will find some strength to face this challenge... Has anyone had a similiar experience, where something has been picked up small on a scan?? It is hard for me to believe that the cancer is back as I have been feeling the best I have felt in years both physically and mentally, I think in my self I had got to a place of acceptance with it all, that the cancer might come back but I was going to do my darndest to keep living my life and achieving my dreams whatever the outcome (I am hoping perhaps this acceptance will help me to face this next hurdle and it is good that I was feeling strong in myself )... I know there will be tough days ahead.. and perhaps it will hit me further down the track? I welcome hearing from all of you. Also what should I be asking my Oncologist? Any suggested sites re information. It sounds like surgery isn't an option given more than one spot and on both lungs. Rads no, so chemo the option... although he is talking about removing a spot to check the receptors again.. This sucks, especially at the age of 35.... it has robbed me and my husband of our dreams, the doors have closed on having children and this will take me some time to get my head around as I had been living in hope, guess my hope will have to be channelled in a different direction now. Thanks for listening. Joanne Log in to post a reply",

Firstly, yes they are confirming it is mets, due to showing on CT and the exact spots on PET \"lighting up\" or taking up glucose. I think they are really only thinking biopsy and possible surgery to remove affected lymph node behind sternum to look at HER2 and hormone status in case that has changed. Will double check with Onc on Thursday. What else should I be asking for? Cal gal, I appreciate your openness in sharing. I have been advised given now advanced bc, pregnancy is not an option, door closed. I went through freezing embryos, seeing fertility specialist, taking lupron whilst on chemo back in 05 when I was first diagnosed. We did all we could, and after all that I got my period back and last blood tests showed normal hormone levels. DAMN! Thank you for taking the time to respond :-) I will keep you updated Joanne",

I trust my Oncologist and he has a good reputation, he did say he is conservative when it comes to chemo, and his reasons sounded reasonable to me, he is discussing my case at a meeting Friday, so even though I haven't got a second opinion, I feel he is consultative and doing all he can to get others opinions... I will certainly keep the option of getting another opinion up my sleeve, guess it is one step at a time, first we need to know if the pathology has changed or not. Anyone else out there diagnosed with small spots on lungs \"early\"? no symptoms? I would be interested to know what steps you decided to take, especially if triple neg.  Thanks for your time and encouragement Hanging in there!",

(given more than one, and my history),  re treatment he said that it might be a matter of waiting and watching, as to begin treatment now when they are so small may not have a lot of benefit and just cause me to feel sick... when I feel well and don't have any symptoms... and to do a scan in 6-8 weeks to see if any changes... hard to accept that unlike last time there will be a little bit of time, just working out best way to approach it and have a plan... what have others done that have been diagnosed when no symptoms for lung mets? He said that he wants to keep the chemo options open and to begin too early may mean we run out of options quicker etc... Welcome your feedback.. HAPPY EASTER!",

I am grappling with some of the same issues as you re children, hope and goals, how can I bring children into my life...... Some days I know I have to keep planning, hoping and other days I just feel bowled over by the grief of  not having children and seeing friends getting pregnant, planning for things with their children.... it makes me feel isolated that I won't probably get to have the parenting experience.. Still  I have much to be grateful for in my life, but that doesn't ease all of the grief!:-) I am not sure re adoption... here in Australia things are a little tighter... to adopt, you would have to be cancer free for many years, if ever accepted....",
