I don't know whether its a lump or what. I think they look like spots on the ultrasound. I don't know. They don't tell you anything. scarlett- I hope yours comes out B9 too!! Let me know how it goes. I'll post on here tomorrow. I'm having mine in the afternoon. I don't even want to teach in the morning because I'm so upset about this. I figure its better than sitting around worrying like I'm doing now. Plus I'm reading all over the internet and freaking myself out. I know what you mean by looking at there expression. When I had my ultrasound last week. I felt like yelling out to the ultrasound tech what are you looking at!! She was spending 10 minutes in one area on my one boob. I had a feeling she was looking at something. I didn't say anything to her bc I figured she can't say anything. I hate getting these tests they cause me such anxiety!",

I just had implants put in this past nov. while I should have had another ultrasound then! I had an ultrasound in May 2013 and they told me to come back in 6 months and I never did bc I got the implants. My last mammo and ultrasound was on jan 2012. I'm having issues with the implants and need them replaced in May. Although who knows if that's going to happen now. I had a routine mammo and ultrasound last week they called me to come back in for more mammo views and ultrasound. I see a breast surgeon because I had a lipoma in my left armpit. He called me today and told me that I have nothing to worry about and just go there and get the other views done. Well I got them done and now they want to biopsy 2 different spots in the left breast. Well If I have nothing to worry about then why are they now doing a biopsy??? I'm just upset. Didn't that the ultrasound in May pick it up or did they miss it?? I went to a different place too. I'm so mad. Can things grow that fast?? I can't believe it. The radiologist today didn't say exactly what she saw but she said one spot looks a little funny, whatever that means. Not funny to me. I'm scared. I called my breast surgeon afterwards and he wasn't in and the nurse said he'll call me tommorow and not to worry. Tomorrow is my biopsy. Log in to post a reply",
