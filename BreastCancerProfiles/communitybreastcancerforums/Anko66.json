Other things to consider:  your bed - is it comfortable?  you deserve to be sleeping in the most comfortable bed ever, so I would suggest a new mattress if you can afford it, and spend as much as you can. Next:  exercise, again I don't know if I'm being unrealistic, but if there's any way you can get a little exercise this might help tire you out physically and aid sleep.  Apologies if this is just not an option but I thought it might be worth mentioning. Finally, you could try working with a hypnotherapist.  I used one for some issues I was having with food several years ago and it worked instantly.  The effects wore off after a few months but it was instant relief from an issue I thought was out of my control. However, if you're trying all these things and not getting any relief then this really is a serious issue that your palliative team should be working hard to resolve for you. Please continue posting, and don't worry about venting ever.  We are all thinking about you and hoping that you can get some relief soon.",

It feels a lot like morning sickness to me where you need to eat to keep the nausea at bay.

I was having pain in my liver and numbness in my arms due to progression (I haven't had surgery and I have three masses in my left breast, as well as numerous liver mets). We could tell that FEC was working after 5-6 weeks. All pain and numbness was gone and tumour markers decreasing. Oncologist is so confident that we're not going to scans again until progression is suspected again. In the two days following infusion I feel like I've been hit by a truck and sometimes I am just surviving from hour to hour I feel that bloody awful, like my worst hangover ever. I've learned to manage this by clearing my schedule totally, ie. no work, no social commitments, no childcare. I just focus on myself, try to drink as many fluids as I can, eat whatever I can face, and sleep as much as possible. Sigh, treatment number four tomorrow... but I shouldn't complain....a couple of months ago I was feeling desperate because of progression....ultimately I am extremely thankful that FEC is working, but it's new kind of challenge.",

I then moved to France, mainly to get the best treatment (incidence of breast cancer in Japan is still relatively low compared to Europe) and be eligible for clinical trials and the like.  To be honest it's been a bit of a disaster so far.  I have already had to change hospitals once.  I don't expect special treatment because I have cancer, but I suppose I do expect to be prioritised since I am stage iv and my time is limited.  I hate having to hang around for hours to see consultants, referral appointments not be arranged, waiting weeks for scan results (it took them three weeks to give me CT scan results despite the results showing progression), sometimes I wasn't even able to get hold of anybody on the phone.  So I changed hospital.  Things are better in the new hospital but still not perfect.  I can tell that my oncologist has too many patients.  I need to remind him who I am and where I am with treatment, scans, etc.  I know that I don't make things easy for them since I travel a lot and have the odd treatment in other countries so I just try to keep on top of things myself in making sure I have regular scans, ECGs, etc. I know that having changed oncologist four times means that I've probably missed the boat on some treatments and surgeries.  I mean, right now I'm five months into my second run of Taxol.  Biopsies confirmed that I was triple negative in February and yet my oncologist kept me on Herceptin until I changed hospitals in April.  That really had my new oncologist scratching his head.  However, it is only now (June) that I am being offered Avastin + Taxol.  I should have been on the Avastin from February.  The toxicity from the TAxol is really accumulating now, but I've got to tough it out for another three months in order to get the Avastin.  I just hope I can do this. I've been offered no support whatsover in France.  I suppose it's up to me to pick up the leaflets or the phone but being in a foreign country it's not that easy because you have no frame of reference at all.  Like you Nicky, it's not even easy to talk to other patients as we are all screened off during treatment.  And at times they way that they do things here drives me mad (nurses don't even discuss side-effects - they just refer you to your onocologist) but I'm slowly learning how things work.   Overall I still think I'm in the right place but at times I get so frustrated i just cry.",

Nevertheless, it was the manner in which he did it:  judgemental, direct, rude.  I left the bar in floods of tears and I'm embarassed about that too. I'm not giving up though ladies.  We did find a lovely apartment yesterday, and I am waiting to hear if the landlord will accept us as tenants or choose the two students who also want the flat. I will update more soon.",

I was supposed to only be back in the UK just for Christmas (Dec 2011) but following my diagnosis I decided to stay with my parents iin the UK for treatment.   This decision was also made in light of a missed diagnosis in Japan last summer (mammogram and ultrasound came back clear) so I had somewhat developed a distrust of the medical system over there, and I'm definitely not giving up my UK oncologist!  My side effects from taxol have been minimal so I started to put the wheels in motion to transfer treatment about a month ago.   All consultants, doctors and nurses on both sides have been fantastic about making this happen for me.

They also sent me for more scans yesterday which I think is a good thing in that they are taking responsibility. Not sure I want to change treatment regime so soon since the taxol and herceptin combo is working... Also no cold caps are used in the hospital so I imagine I am days away from my hair falling out, sigh.

Just last week I did a self-exam and realized that one of the tumours in my breast had grown back, and a CT scan confirmed this also with progression in the liver again. Mastectomy is not an option I suppose for me right now but I had ruled it out anyway. I couldn't find any real evidence that it would extend my life span. I might still change my mind if I can get stable and it looks like I'll be around for a while though. I think there's a mental health aspect to this as well. It is horrible to feel that the cancer is growing again (but is a useful marker). Anne",

For me also I imagine there will be psychological benefits too since I can feel the two tumours in my breast.  It's not a good feeling. My surgeon recommended a unilateral mastectomy because the chances of any new incidence of cancer/or it spreading to the other breast are minimal.  Having said that, I had an ultrasound and mammogram, and was then sent for a breast MRI this week because they are suspicious of something in the other breast now.

Anyhow, given my new triple negative status my new super oncologist will take me off herceptin and put me on avastin.  I have searched around for info but can only find not so positive reports about it.  In fact, if I were in the UK I wouldn't get it because it's not been approved for metastatic breast cancer as other drugs can do what it can do for a lot less money. I'd be greatful to hear anybody's experience's good or bad. Thanks, Anne xx Dx 12/16/2011, IDC, 2cm, Stage IV, Grade 3, mets, PR+, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Anko66 wrote: I've got tears in my eyes as I write this.  I'm wondering what is the best way to deal with young children and a stage IV diagnosis.  My daughter was three when I was diagnosed, and because I was having weekly treatments, the nurses recommended that I bring her into the infusion room just for a quick visit so that she could see where I was going every week.  That worked okay.  She's now four and occasionally she says to me \"mummy's sick\".  Sometimes she asks me \"are you gonna die?\".  I don't think she has any real concept of what this means, but she must have been listening to me talking to somebody, and I realise I should be more careful. I also can't stop thinking about how much she should see when things get really bad towards the end.  At some point, I know I won't be able to look after her anymore and she'll probably have to go back to Japan to be with her Dad.  Ugh, I'm not even sure where I'm going with this post.  All I know is this:  I can cope with just about everything to do with this stage iv diagnosis but as soon as I think of my daughter I'm a complete mess.
