    "Content": "preciousgrama wrote: I was newly diagnosed with liver mets after a year and a half in remission. I am trying to find my way through all the trial options and medication choices. Also where do I get a second opinion which seems to be recommended. I had a double mastetomy for lobular cancer in April of 2011 although only one side was cancerous - the other precancerous. I have had chemo and radiation and I really don\"t know what to go with next. Any input would be much appreciated! Log in to post a reply",
