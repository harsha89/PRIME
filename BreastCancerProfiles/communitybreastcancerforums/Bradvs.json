    "Content": "Bradvs wrote: My wife has metastatic breast cancer in her lungs. She is undergoing treatments for this. (herceptin) the reason I'm on this is to see if anyone may be able to help me out. Last night we found a large lump on the side of her head. She's felt sick lately and nauseous. It doesn't hurt and she has no idea where it came from. I have called her oncologist but haven't heard back from him yet and I am concerned. I told her not to worry about it, if it was a tumor it would be inside her skull and not bulging out the side. I said this to calm her down but I don't know. Do any of your think it could be that? Is there something common it could be? I have no idea what to think about it. She is only 35 and been thru 8 months of chemo, 6 weeks of radiation, 4 months for bio-molecular medicine - 3 months of herceptin - and 4 surgeries. Any ideas what it could be?
