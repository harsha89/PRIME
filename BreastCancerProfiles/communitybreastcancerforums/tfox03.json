I'm thankful they called, even though they didn't have the results yet. It makes me feel like I'm not forgotten :) I'm worried because of the dark color of the discharge.  I've been reading some of the topics today, and notice some reference a \"clear\" discharge. Mine is really dark, brownish red and was very noticible and very frequent. Even so much as staining the sheets. My family history isn't the best, so I'm a little concerned, to say the least. My aunt had both breasts removed, and another died from ovarian cancer. I guess my family \"gene pool\" isn't the greatest.... I'm trying to stay positive...... I just wish they would call with the results......",

My mammogram didn't show any lumps, but I had a dark bloody discharge. I wasn't worried in the beginning, even though the thoughts of \"bloody discharge\" doesn't put a smile on anyone's face.... Is anyone else familiar with this symptom, course of treatment? As you can see, I am very naive and would appreciate anyone's input on this subject. Log in to post a reply",
