Biopsy performed 6 weeks ago. Dx nothing. Having slides re-read due to mistakes throughout the radiology reports, path reports, etc. Am now noticing that when I lift my right arm there is a long indention near the bottom outside of the breast. On the left side near the incision there is a white area that runs overtop of the cut looking almost like an x. This is indented also. Has anyone else experienced this type of thing after having lumpectomies? Log in to post a reply",

Set up for MRI/Mammogram every six months by my oncologist. Last year another site was found (papaloma) with surgery in August. MRI done in Dec and report shows additional nodules adjacent to site of last surgery and list them as benign. So every year I am having one or two procedures which does make it quite a roller coaster. I was not raised by my bio parents but have learned that my moms sister died with bc and all brothers died with cancer. No idea what my mom died from. My dad died from leukemia with cancer in his family history. Medicare will not cover BRAC testing and I am left with the \"waiting game\". Any suggestions from those that have gone through numerous diagnosis of ADH and surgeries?",
