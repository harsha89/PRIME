As Rainnyc notes, chemo is often a taxane. I was given the chemo drugs Taxotere and Carboplatin in addition to both Herceptin and Perjeta. Now that I've had surgery, I'll be moving to Herceptin only to finish out a year's treatment. Not everyone is put on the same regimen, so yours could be different, but that was my experience. As Rainnyc says, your MO should tell you what you'll be receiving and what to expect so you can prepare. Losing one's hair often happens very quickly and suddenly with these drugs. My MO warned me of that, but it still came as a shock. For me, it happened about 10 days after my first infusion. I was caught a little bit off guard, with everything moving so fast. Just adding to the sentiment that I'm sorry you're having to go through this. But as a fellow HER2+ fighter, I can tell you that the antibody drugs in conjunction with the chemo tend to be extremely effective. I wish you all the best with your treatment.",

My 7-year-old son asked me last night at dinner how long it will be before I have \"lady hair\" again--meaning, in his definition, hair down to my shoulders like it was before cancer. I broke the news, \"Oh, probably more than a year,\" and he was a little bummed out. When my hair started to fall out and I shaved it off, it was really hard for him. But I told him I might do something interesting with color while it's super short, and that made him smile. catlady, tjh, anotherNYCGirl: I agree that cancer absolutely sucks for taking so much from us. I've been struggling with this question of what my new normal will be. After fighting through chemo, I just recently had my mastectomy, and I still have reconstruction to go--probably sometime this summer. Which in my case will be reconstruction of the removed breast and reduction of my healthy breast to match. So much change in a year, so much turmoil and trauma and fear. I don't know how I feel about myself/my body anymore. Before breast cancer, I had this image of myself as this very healthy, almost indestructible person. I'd never had a serious illness or injury in my life. Genetically, I come from a long line of pretty healthy, long-lived folks. I had healthy habits, and had been focused on getting some of my less-healthy habits back on track (e.g. had started running again, cleaning up my diet, etc.). Being diagnosed with cancer just wasn't something I ever imagined could happen to me. Now that I've come through the worst of it, I feel so unclear about who I am now. Everyone in my world keeps telling me how strong and brave I am, and I *kind of* feel strong and brave--but honestly, just as much, I feel fragile and afraid. Anyway, wishing everyone a very good Tuesday. As hard as some of these days inevitably are, I wish for everyone a trajectory that is moving steadily upward. ",

I think in general, comments on one's appearance--unless they're directly asked for, or are a straight compliment--should be a great big no-no. This made me think of this weird thing that happened to me. A few weeks ago, I was at an event for my son's baseball team where basically the whole league was there. I was wearing a little beanie cap and a woman who was a complete stranger walked up, put her hand on my arm, and said, \"I just want you to know how brave you are! I'm in the struggle, too,\" and then walked away. I kind of stammered a thank you, but I felt really taken aback and embarrassed. Honestly, when I'm out at an event for my kid, having a stranger get up in my face and remind me that I have cancer and that I look different is kind of jarring. I wanted to ask what struggle she thinks I'm in. I mean, I could have no hair for reasons other than cancer. On the other hand, I'm lucky in that almost everyone I've encountered since this started has been really considerate and kind. I've seen some of the comments people have gotten and I can't believe the level of insensitivity people can have. I hope it's a good weekend for everyone, with loads of follicular progress! :)",

Still, my final chemo infusion was the last week of January, and I shaved the chemo regrowth off just a few weeks ago, so the amount of growth I'm seeing--at least on some parts of my noggin--have me feeling hopeful. Still a long way from feeling comfortable going hatless, but moving steadily in that direction. Which is good, 'cause the weather's getting warmer here and I'm getting tired of having a sweaty head!

But I was just reading twiggyOR's post about letting things grow and just buzzing off the ends--which gets rids of the chemo regrowth stuff without resorting to shaving down to bare skin. That seems like a great way to go. twiggyOR, I've read in earlier posts on this board that hair grows in pretty unevenly, so hopefully the neck hairline area will catch up eventually! I have the same issue but with the very crown of my head, and my forehead hairline. The stubble on the rest of my head is longer and thicker, and there's barely anything right above my forehead. But from what I've read, that area can be slower to fill in.",

This whole process of losing and regrowing my own hair has made me so much more attentive to how many women around me in my day to day life are rocking super short hair and looking amazing. I reached peak IDGAF this week, I guess, because on Monday and Tuesday I went to the office without my customary beanie. Honestly, I didn't feel totally ready in a sense, because my hair growth is still sparser than I'm comfortable with--particularly in the top/front hairline. But I'd been going without head coverings at home and when shopping for about a week, and it's just felt so good (especially with the warmer weather). I figured that I get looks from people when I show up to work in my little beanie...what's the difference if I get looks for showing up with my barely-there fuzz? ;-) Here's how it looks, roughly 14 weeks PFC (but I did shave off the chemo stuff around 6 weeks PFC). I can't really tell what's going on, straight or curly-wise. The hair on the sides seems fairly straight but the hair on the top is growing every which way. Eyebrows have filled in slightly in spots, but I still have to pencil them in daily. Eyelashes are little stubs, mostly.  ",

I complained that I looked like a dude with a receding hairline. ;-) But that started to really change for me in the past couple of weeks. My last chemo was 1/25, but I did shave the white fuzz in early March. Now, about 9-10 weeks after shaving, I'm finally comfortable going hatless! My hair is of course super short but looks almost intentional. There are still areas filling in around the temples, but they *are* filling in. So don't despair--with that much regrowth by 8.5 weeks, I think you're going to see a big difference soon. Also, losing your brows and lashes after chemo ends seems to be super common. I too kept my brows & lashes all the way through chemo and then lost them shortly after chemo ended. They're growing back in, though! Still a little stubby, but definitely making a comeback. It's very normal for the enormity of this stuff to really hit after chemo, surgeries, etc., are done. I think when we're going through those treatments, we put most of our energy into just surviving them. After that part is over, we're trying to pick up the pieces and understand what our \"new normal\" will be. I'm still working my way through all that and have a feeling it's gonna be a long process.
