I had unilateral MX with sentinel node biopsy. 7/14 pos nodes, ER/PR+, HER2NEU- I remember those feelings. I had 6 sessions of chemo afterthe MX and then 25 rounds of daily rads. I'm now on Tamoxifen. So far so good. I wish you luck. If anyone wants to reach me I can be reached by Private Message. Best always, Bob Edited by Mods to remove member's private email address.",
