    "Content": "wind2B wrote: I was diagnosed about a month ago  with Invasive Lobular Carcinoma and have had a mastectomy.   I'm ER+, PR-, HER2+.  The 3 cm tumor had a histologic grade of 3.  The sentinel node and 3mm margins were clear.  It is now being suggested (recommended) that I have chemotherapy.  I can find very little literature on the short and long term effects of chemotherapy on Type I diabetes care.  I'm 64,have had diabetes for 43 years, am on an Omnipod insulin pump, and am very active.  I'd like to hear from women who are Type I and have experience with the short and long terms effect on their diabetic issues.  I'd be delighted to also hear from medical people who have insight into these issue and any references from research literature that applies in this case.
