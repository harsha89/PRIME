I went down to 41kg in June 2017 and I found a lump in my left breast which has grown into the size of a tennis ball(october 2017). I am eating around 4/5 huge meals a day and i have not been able to put weight on for about a year now. I use to work out so much and I would never be able to go under 50kg. Around June this year I found a lump in my left breast that started off as a small little lump. It grew and grew and it's about the size of a tennis ball now. Extremely painful, I can't sleep on my front, I can't wear a bra, I cannot even run. I was literally flat chested before any of this started I have gone from a 30a to a 34B in the space of 6 months. I went to the doctors the doctor who checked found the lump and also found 3 lympnodes about 7cm down from my armpit. He referred me to the breast cancer clinical and they refused every test. The first time I went there the doctor had a feel for around 2 minutes and told me it's fine and nothing to worry about. She said she couldn't find any lympnodes. 3 weeks later this lump really started to grow slowly and I went back to my doctor he said he could feel the lump and the lymphnodes and referred me again. They did a ultra sound after hours of me begging them(due to my age) they kept telling me nothing like this happens in young women and it's nothing to worry about \"it's probably my hormones and periods\". They did an ultra sound and they told me it was tissue. The ultra sounded lasted 20 seconds the doctor actually left the room for 40 mins and I could hear him laughing in the next room. I asked him about the lympnodes as they had been there for a while but he said it's \"probably down to my periods\". I went back to my doctors and he could find the lympnodes again and referred me again as this lump was growing. The doctor (same person) again refused all tests whilst me and my mum sat there and cried as one breast was growing much larger than the other and I had pain she didn't even check me! Or check the lympnodes and kept putting it down to my age. This whole experience really put me off doctors and it's been the most horrific experience. I went back to my doctor and he said he can't do anything else as I'll be moving away for Uni ( this was September 2017) and I would have to register with a gp in another town. 6 months on my breast is huge. It hurts. I can't sleep on my front. I can't run. Or even walk fast. I have since then grew another lump in my left breast which is also growing and has the same pain as the other one. My breasts are different sizes and it won\u2019t stop growing, I have genuinely had enough! I have an appointment booked with a new gp on Friday. Could anyone please give me some ideas on if they have ever experienced anything like this? What I can do to make the doctors take me more seriously? and not put everything down to periods as this has been here for 6 months and I can even feel the 3 lympnodes 7cm down from my armpit, the 2 lumps have not disappeared and I don't understand how it can be down to periods. Whilst they refuse me every time. Ive also still not been able to gain weight and they did normal regular blood tests and nothing came back. I\u2019m very unsure on what to do.

The ultra sound was done in june 2017 when the lump was a size of a grape, they have refused all tests since then, October 2017 the lump is the size of a tennis ball, very thick and I can feel it move very easily, in my right breast the lump hasn\u2019t been checked out yet but I would say the sizes of 4/5 grapes. I will call them now and get a report. The issue is they didn\u2019t find any lympnodes, and myself and my doctor can feel 3 that have been there for months. Everytime I go there\u2019s it the same women and she has done absolutely nothing to help me. The second time I got referred and the third time did she didn\u2019t even check for the lympnodes even though that was the reason I was referred for them to be checked out. And on the 3rd occasion she didn\u2019t even have a feel of the breasts, and just told me I have to have a routine checkup every 4 months Many thanks.",
