That will save time and possibly money.  It will give them a preview of your breasts and enable them to begin to a review right away. Hang tough.",

I suggest getting a written copy of the biopsy report and ask questions about characteristics of your cancer cells.  As you gather more information it is easier to focus on your own situation and how your cancer might be approached with various treatments beyond surgery, radiation and the like.  This is scary stuff but you are a strong woman and you will get through this.  Stay connected to us here.  We offer our support and strength to you.     ",

Then make a list of questions and bring someone with you to the appointments.  Ask for a printed copy of the test results that have been done, the biopsy results, any labs, various scans etc.  Then ask the doctor(s) to interpret these for you.    In my case, not knowing what is going on just fuels the anxiety.  There is so much information available about diseases/conditions that it is hard to rein in your fears until there are some definites.  Then you can focus, fight, plan. You will get through this because you are a tough gal. And you have a lot of support here.  Take care...let us know how this unfolds. ",
