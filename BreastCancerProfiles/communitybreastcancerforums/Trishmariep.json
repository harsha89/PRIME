Mine was on 3/6 and I still have decent bruising, which I expected. I also have a pretty big, very tender lump under the bruised area. Hurts to touch, hurts when I move my arm certain ways. Is this normal?",

The radiologist found a cluster of pleomorphic calcifications in my left breast. Now I'm scheduled for a biopsy on March 6th. My results say Bi-Rads - Suspicious. I was also told I have heterogeneously dense breasts. I'm pretty freaked out...I thought I was just going for a baseline to compare future mammos to and now this. They say they will be doing a stereotactic biopsy, and they were very vague about what they thought. Log in to post a reply",
