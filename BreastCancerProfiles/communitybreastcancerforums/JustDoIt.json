History: Jan. 2010, positive mammogram BIRADS 4b right breast-grouped microcalcifications.  Biopsy under general anesthesia was recommended because I have severe back problems and they thought I couldn't hold the position. Got a 2nd opinion from an independent diagnostic radiologist specializing in breast cancer, who said \"nothing is wrong with you, your fine!\" Then I heard her tell her assistant, through the thin walls, \"that's the 9th one so far this week from Mt. Sinai, unbelievable...\".  Life went on and began to have pain in right breast. Went back to 2nd opinion doctor who seemed irritated and gave me an ultrasound that didn't last 30 seconds, again \"you're fine. You've got a herniated disc in your neck radiating down to your ribcage, that's why the right breast pain.\" And yes, I had been at Publix prior to the breast pain beginning and a bag boy rammed me with 10 grocery carts he had lined up, running full speed into my back and MRI did show \"right sided radiculopathy\".   Wanting to clear this up once and for all, had 11 diagnostic mammograms at another Breast Cancer Center--didn't tell me much except calcifications were anterior and medial (on the surface and in the center?) and scheduled me tomorrow for core needle biopsy (not aspiration), mammogram-guided, with titanium marker inserted and I'm SCARED, SO SCARED, and am wondering if the calcifications were not related to caked talcum powder I had during the mammogram in the location of the calcifications (assuming \"anterior\" means \"surface\").  The tech just said don't worry about it, but researching this indicates it can mimic calcifications and produce false positives, especially near the surface.  Has anyone had any similar experience?  My 20 year old son is in tears all day about this - he has severe OCD and this fear, of losing me, is breaking the camel's back.  I'd like to reassure him somehow.  Also, I fear yet additional radiation exposure as I've already had many CT Scans, Bone Density tests, x-rays, MRI's (\"magnetic radiation\") plus the recent 11 view mammogram series, and 3 before that as the Mt. Sinai tech had to repeat her screening and diagnostic mammograms twice-anyone worried about this?  I understand the biopsy includes more of the same, before and after marker is inserted.  So sorry, lot to ask, but they scheduled biopsy tomorrow and I'm almost about to call it off.  If anyone can advise on their experience relating to the talcum powder false positive, or spine/neck injury causing chest/breast pain and advise if I should take more hits of radiation just to get this settled by biopsy, once and for all, it would be MUCH appreciated.  What a blessing your forum is, could read it all day -- thank you and sorry for lengthy treatise.

And what's the best thing to remember to do afterwards to make sure all goes well, i.e. minimal bleeding and preventing the marker from moving.  I was told no NSAIDS or aspirin, lots of ice, minimal upper body movement - what did you find most helpful? Also, I really don't want that marker, but doctors probably won't do it without. My large intestines perforated after a colonoscopy and high Prednisone therapy, from which I became very bloated and obviously, put further pressure on my intestines.  I'm little, 5'1\", very small breasts and can't stop thinking about chest wall perforation-before or after the insertion. There just isn't much between my nipple and my chest wall.  Are markers ALWAYS indicated in a biopsy and if possible, how do women succeed in refusing it? Again, I was told doctor won't do it. But another nurse said one woman was allowed no marker, but had to sign paper stating she'd agree to another core biopsy if results were positive.  Any ideas?  Am I making too much of this?",
