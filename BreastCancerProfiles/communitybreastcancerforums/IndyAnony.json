Doc had already ordered biopsy but my letter they gave me immediately said negative, even though i have an enlarged lymph node of unknown cause. Really curious how they came to that conclusion.  I even signed up for the online med chart, but there is no info on.  Not a happy camper.",

My lumps were not seen on the mammogram and as far as the ultrasound the breast lump I was told looks like probably normal tissue or a cyst. I was told the lump under the arm is likely an enlarged lymph node, although I don't know why I would have one, no illness/injury.  This all sounds rather inconclusive to me, yet the letter (not an official report) reads negative but also says not to rule out further exam/consultation with the refering doctor.  No one has mentioned a BIRADS score at all.  I would appreciate any info on BIRADS.  What BIRADS score do they assign when they can't see something, or what they see is unclear? Why would they coin it as negative if they didn't see it on the mammogram? Also. the mammogram was supposed to be diagnostic, yet they only took one view.  Shouldn't they have taken more views, especially when they did not see the lumps on the first view?  Both lumps are palpable.  Heading to the doc's in an hour and a half.  I  would appreciate any quick responses.

I am a former drinker/smoker, overweight, and have Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome. All of this combined means my body makes a crazy amount of estrogen vs. little to no progesterone.  I have (from what I can tell) an almond shaped lump that is a bit larger than an actual almond in my left breast.  It is next to my nipple on the inner side of my breast. It is painless, close to the surface, and feels attached on one side but kind of mobile on the other.  It has been there for quite some time- and yes, I know I should not have waited!  Within the last two weeks, a lump has appeared under my left arm. It is pea sized or a bit larger and somewhat painful if I prod it. I can't really tell if it is getting bigger but it definately isn't going away. It is on the same side as the breast lump. I have been feeling very fatigued, but I also undertook a very busy new schedule as of August. I have no insurance, and the doc I was sent to immediately ordered a diagnostic mammogram, diagnostic ultrasound, and biopsy. She spent 10-15 minutes discussing my case with another doc in which time I heard \"needs referal to breast surgeon immediately\" \"not good\".  When I opened the door they got all hush-hush on me.  The charity that is helping me pay for testing will not pay for the biopsy until the other results are back.  What do you all think about all of this? Honesty please. No sugarcoating. I have been a wreck all week.  Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "IndyAnony wrote: I saw my breast lump during my ultrasound.  I would describe the shape as that of an eggplant or squash- kind of a oval but then narrowing and curving at the end. The inside looks black-from what I have read that means fluid-filled.  The borders are well defined except for the end where the lump curls up, that border is very fuzzy looking. The bottom border was thicker and whiter than the other border.  Does this sound like a simple cyst? I thought simple cysts were oval/round and symmetrical? Can a cyst be attached?  I know no one here is a doctor, I am just wondering what you have seen on your scans, and what this sounds like to you.  Still haven't heard back from the doc who reffered me for the testing.  The other lump, under my arm, is becoming very painful.

I just want to know.  I wouldn't be freaking out so much if it weren't for the spot under my arm. I have never felt anything like it before and it in combination with the breast lump is really weighing on my mind.  Thanks for the prayers... prayer is kinda of an iffy thing for me but apparently a friend of the family has the entire archdiocese of Baltimore praying for me tonight... perhaps I should take it up after all! How long did it take you to get results when you went through this before?  Patience is not a virtue I posess. I really hope the radiologist talks to me before I go.",
