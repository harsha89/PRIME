I don't think I sweat very much, which is what general forums suggested for this phenomenon. Is it possible the Adriamycin \"red devil\" is sloughed off through the skin? I know this is nothing to freak out over, but I can't figure it out! It reminds me of how white cotton underwear looks after wearing new black jeans. There must be some transfer of color, however, I'm not sleeping in new black jeans! My light beige fitted sheet almost has a taupe color to it now - only where I sleep. Has anyone else noticed anything similar to this? Log in to post a reply",
