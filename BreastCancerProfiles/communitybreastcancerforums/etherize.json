It sucks to get a cancer diagnosis when you don't have a family history and you've done everything \"right.\"  But unfortunately bc doesn't discriminate.  There's no use wondering how/why you got it (although we all do at some point). I don't know how you feel about meds, but a lot of us have gotten through the initial days of terror with the help of Ativan (lorazepam).  It can really help you get the rest you need, and help keep your mind from completely going off the rails.

So how can I know what I want (lumpectomy or MX)? That's what I meant by an \"impossible decision.\" Before I got bc, I thought a lumpectomy was one operation. Now I'm learning it's rarely one operation -- it's one to get the tumor out, another one or two to clean up margins, a MX, etc. etc.! Like you said, I don't like the idea of lopping off a breast in pieces, just because I don't like the idea of so many operations. Having said that, I agree that few surgeons are scheduling surgeries just for the money. I didn't mean to imply Kaiser docs are that way; I just don't know their system well yet. From my research, it seems most surgeons recommend lumpectomies when there is a choice, just to be on the conservative side. But they'll go along with the patient if she wants an MX or even BMX. It IS cool that I get to meet with 3 docs up front. Apparently not all Kaiser locations offer this \"breast cancer clinic.\" When the nurse said some patients don't opt to do it, my question was \"WHY?!\" :-)",

The good news is they *think* the main tumor's an early stage (mammo showed 1.8cm and u/s showed 2.9cm).  I forgot to ask about the grade. As for worrying about recurrences in that breast or the other \u2026 I don't think that'll be a huge issue for me.  There are so many cancers and other dire things that people with AIDS are at high risk for, you just have to learn to deal with that uncertainty.  ",

He is a senior MO to my regular MO and apparently he's advised her a fair amount on my case already.  (I'm going to see if I can switch to him!)  He said doing the Oncotype is fine with them if I want it, but it's not as good as MammaPrint, which it's too late for anyway.  But the most important thing is that the Oncotype would be most helpful to me if I were 100% sure that I'd do chemo if it came back with a high score.  And I'm not sure that a high or low score on that would really be THE deciding factor for me.  It's just another variable among many in what essentially has to boil down to a gut feeling.  bdavis, I already knew the chemo regimens that were on the table: T/C and CMF.  (The others have heart SEs that would be too dangerous.)  Many people do chemo and HIV meds, but my situation is more problematic.   I am on the one HIV med that has major interactions with chemo drugs (Cytoxan to some extent and Taxotere to a much greater extent).  A lot of HIV+ cancer patients can switch HIV meds during chemo, but the virus I have is resistant to almost all HIV meds.  So I'm stuck with the one that has big chemo-drug interactions.  Even going with a lower dose of chemo, there would be lots of risk with my HIV med and T/C, the most effective (but shorter) regimen of the two.  I could stay on HIV meds while doing CMF, but that's a 5-6 month stretch that's overall less effective (even if less toxic). Oh by the way, I only have 1 positive node, not two. :)  Thank heavens for small favors! This MO said the ECE is another factor but it's lower on the scale in a way.  The main issues are the size of the original tumor and the one positive node.  Even the one positive node, he said, isn't \"that bad\" in itself, but when you take it with the grade ... so in order of importance, it's size, node, grade, ECE, etc.    toomuch, thanks for the explanation about LVI and ECE.  Just looked on my path report and I apparently have both.  Wish I'd asked him about that, but ... I can always do that later.  He did say I was at \"intermediate risk\" of recurrence.   I like the way he described chemo:  it's like insurance.  Everybody pays for it, most people don't need it, but for those who do, it's a lifesaver.

I am still having such a hard time trying to decide about whether to do chemo or not.  I just don't know if I'll be strong enough for it.  I met with the HIV pharmacist, who insists I can (and should) stop all HIV meds if I do chemo -- although no other patients at Kaiser Santa Rosa have done that (they've all been able to switch HIV meds but I can't due to virus resistance.) So my choice is:  contain HIV or try to stop cancer.  Waaah.....! Today I meet with another MO in the same dept (can't afford to go outside of Kaiser).  I also asked my MO for the Oncotype test (she offered) but after reading DeannaM's post above, I'm worried because I also had extracapsular invasion on my one positive node.  My MO didn't specifically say that meant it would be more likely to recur, although she did say it was bad. Every hour I change my mind on which way to go!  Right now I'm leaning toward chemo. Oh, does anybody here know if Kaiser will pay for Neulasta shots instead of Neupogen?  I really, really would much prefer one shot to many. ",

I do have a breast care coordinator and all she said was that if the scans show cancer elsewhere, I'd be a Stage IV (which I already knew).   ",

Anyway, I didn't even know I had HIV until 1995 when I got very sick.   Now, after 15 years of living with AIDS (and 29 years of living with HIV), I've finally got my immune system in fairly good shape.  I take several medications and deal with a number of side effects of the disease and the drugs, but I'm not on death's doorstep anymore.   My husband (who remains HIV-negative, after 24 years of marriage) and I switched to a new insurance company in July and I figured it was time to stop putting off the mammogram.  Sure enough, I was called back for another mammo and an ultrasound.  The sonographer pointed out a lump that's easily to feel and seems big to me (it's also a little tender).  I never felt it because I rarely do BSEs! When they finished the ultrasound, the radiologist came in and said I needed a biopsy.  I asked if I could put it off (knowing she'd probably say no), and asked, \"Is it serious?  Is it cancer?\"  and she said, \"It's serious.\"     I studied the sonogram images carefully, and when I got home I looked up online sonogram pictures of malignant masses.  I think my image looks like those. :(   Not only am I terrifed of yet another life-threatening disease, but I'm kicking myself for not taking better care of myself, for not getting mammos earlier, etc., etc.  I should have known better.

I had my lumpectomy and SNB 8 days ago, and the skin on my side, under my arm and my armpit is so painfully sensitive.  I ran out of my post-surgery pain meds, and haven't asked to get a renewal, since I'm sure they'll give me grief about it. When I was allowed to take a shower (3 days after surgery), most of the big gauze bandage came off, but a piece of the adhesive on my side under my arm was stuck on SO tightly .... It took me 40 minutes of rubbing the skin on my side (VERY gently!) with acetone just to get it off!  I couldn't leave it on, because then my arm would stick to my side.  As it is, there is STILL a tiny bit of adhesive there ... it's just too painful to rub alcohol or acetone or soap or anything on it for very long.  So every day, it's just a little bit less sticky. ;)  BTW, this is all a pretty good distance from the actual incision, in case anybody's freaked about me getting nail polish remover in the incision! Tomorrow I meet with the BS for the post-op and I'm afraid she's going to want to touch something!  I still have the steri-strips on.  I didn't realize until today that they're actually GLUED on.  Do they just yank those off, or what?  I'll run screaming from her office if she tries it!  LOL ",

Getting radiation doesn't hurt the chances of getting future surgeries.  It just means you can't get radiation on the same breast if the cancer came back there; at that point you'd have to have a mastectomy.  You can't have radiation twice in the same place.  But if you keep your breast(s) now, you could have surgery on them later if needed.",

Oh, and Oncotype CAN be done if you have one positive node (it was offered to me) ... they're currently doing a study on node-positive women (I think postmenopausal) and Oncotype. ",

Cancer is so different from HIV.  It's a b**** to have both.  My heart goes out to you, fellow survivor!",

Many women want to conserve as much of their breast as possible, so they lean toward a lump, while others feel safer with a mast (MX) and possibly reconstruction.   As you know, with a lump you will have radiation.  Some people really, really, really want to avoid radiation at all costs, and that's a factor in them deciding on a mast, where the chance of still having to have radiation is very small.  For me, rad is not a big deal, so that weighed in favor of a lump.  Anyway, just take all these factors and break them down one at a time -- pros and cons.  Read up on each and ask questions here.  You might even write it all down so it's easier to work through. And as many people have said, it isn't as much of a rush as it feels like! ;-) Oh, one last thing to answer your question about hormones and being postmenopausal, which I am too.  I learned that it's not just the ovaries that make estrogen ... so even though we've gone through menopause, we're still making estrogen. :-) ",

I've had enough PTSD from previous health issues to fear the absolute worst. Seems to be my luck.  Just fear speaking here. :) All the cutting, injections, pain and post-op recovery is what makes me really nervous, not to mention imagining the long road ahead (which I know I \"shouldn't\" imagine but can't help it).  I feel fairly confident in my BS (as confident as one can be in a well-educated but complete stranger).  It's just the process of going through it all that has me on edge. I am getting a lot of \"deep breathing\" practice in, though -- that's for sure! ;) ",

You're a long way from that conclusion, though, so try not to panic (easier said than done, I know).  It's good that you're following through on this, given your concerns about your family history. Do ask your doctor about this procedure that checks the ducts -- it's something I've never heard of, so can't give you info on that.  Do you know what it's called?   ",
