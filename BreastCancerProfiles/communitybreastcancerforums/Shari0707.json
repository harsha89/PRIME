Still haven't gotten ultrasound but on a good note, saw my breast surgeon yesterday for checkup and to discuss surgery and she hadn't seen me since original diagnosis in the beginning of October and when she felt my tumor this time she was so excited and happy and was telling me that the difference was like night and day and that it was soooo much better...that made me feel great.. I am having my ultrasound and MRI the day I finish chemo... (March 1st..) but I feel ok about all of this.. Usually see my oncologist who also feels tumor only.. Still trying to rest my head around this, with no ultrasound or imaging but it is good to know they feel a difference and don't feel anything new going on... Guess I won't pressure for imaging... What do you think?",

But just assuming it will be better than first except more detailed because they will be removing tumor.... I see oncologist more than bs at this moment so when bs felt tumor it was first time since original diagnosis( before chemo) so her excitement and noticeable observation on tumor being like night and day was great because she hadn't felt the difference. I see oncologist for exam every three weeks and so her noticing change is not as dramatic because I guess she is feeling it more often.. But true, if they both feel something I suppose its true... Thanks for feedback Good luck on ur surgery new direction... I understand the stress of not having that as well.. It's as if you just don't know everything about ur situation until the surgery is done . Pre chemo should just make everything better though.",

Doctors told me they won't know lymph nodes are still positive until surgery but then if they do immediate reconstruction will I still be able to get radiation to lymph node area after reconstruction... I am 31 and my mind tells me to do it all... I know the risks of lymphedema but I want most aggressive treatment there is... But I see all different sorts of feedback on Internet about radiation after mastectomy... So I am wondering should I hold off on reconstruction until after radiation.. Because I heard that too can have negative effects on skin for surgeons doing reconstruction.... So confused... Anyone have any feedback.",

My concer is that I have to wait 4 weeks before surgery.. Docs say its standard protocol for my body to recover from chemo before surgery... Thing I am scared about is that it is 4 weeks for cancer to b in my body with no chemo? How long does chemo stay in body? Will cancer cells continue to grow for tumor in those 4 weeks? I know tumor has shrink but will that period in between give it time to grow or spread again.. It was already known to be in lymph node at diagnoses that's why docs recommended chemo first and to check response and shrink tumor.. Some help here ladies please and thank u! >I hope that's not too long between chemo and surgery.... Any insight anyone? So nervous about having to wait with cancer still inside me....aaahhhh..doctors say body had to recover from chemo before I can go into surgery.... Just want this all to pass and move forward with life a little...it seems there is always something next to deal with.. I am tired",

She completed chemotherapy and we celebrated that. She also had all her imaging done - MRI, mammogram, and ultrasound. The results were very good. The tumor shrunk and is about half its size. Also the lymph nodes look better. Overall, the degree of background intensity (cancer cellular its in tumor) is minimal which is a significant difference from the prior one. Before, it was moderate to severe.The chemo did its job. Yah!!! Tuesday, we meet with another plastic surgeon up here. If all works out, Shari will have surgery at the end of March-- removal of the tumor, mastectomy, and dissection of the lymph nodes. Biopsy. Hopefully those will be good too. So for now a weekend of celebration. Again thanks for all the good thoughts and prayers. They are working and keep them coming. Love, Rita. (Mom) Would have loved for bigger response but doc says that that's not always likely in er/pr positive her2 negative cancers... And she say I had good response....will know for definite at surgery... What worries me a little also is that I have read(I know, bad )that MRI are not always as accurate for measurement of residual cancer withthissame tumor type in so some others. Say er negative and/or her 2 positive.... It's like when I get good news, I always let something push,e back down... Anybody hear that about mri's?",

I think they feel they can assess tumors response to chemo if it is in the body rather than after.. Bc if t is not responding then they can change course of treatment.. I wold le to think this.. As I did research too. And I also read if it changes node postive to node negative its a really good sign towards prognosis.... Good luck",
