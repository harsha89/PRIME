Sometime in the near future I will have radiation for 6 weeks then hormal therapy for yrs.  You wont know the size and grade and er/pr until after your biopsy and you wont know the stage and if its in the lympnodes until after surgery and a more accurate size.  I have to say that God gave me supernatural peace from the beginning. And I just felt it all was going to work out.  Gods in control dont allow satan to give you doubt and worry it will pass to your kids.  like colt45 said,  its a fact women survive breast cancer.   Hope all goes well. ",

See what happens when i get more results from the tumor after surgery.  When I found out I could have a mastectomy later, if I decide to, that helped me make a decision. You are so right annette47 its better to start out with lumpectomy, once the real ones are gone no taking it back.  Golden01 thank you for the site I plan to check it out. MDG, totally understand my kids are all grown. I do have grandkids and Id like tobe around for my kids and my grandkids.  Dani18 sounds like we think alike too, I think that is a good decision. I feel releaved since I decided what to do. Good luck with your surgery be sure to let us know how it goes and after mine  monday Ill post something also. Rozem I did hear mastectomy is major surgery and painful, we have to do what we have to do and we make it through it right :) Im sure we become stronger women. Mumofone I guess I wont know for sure until after surgery some things that could change it to a mastectomy, but I'm having faith for a good outcome. My mind is over loaded! as you all know the feeling.  I found out today i am her2/neg.  I have surgery next monday the 17th. just want to get it done and get on with things.  Alot of me still cant believe i actually have cancer.  I think ive been so busy with test and appoitments, research and reading I havent had time to absorb everything.  So while I wait for surgery I will let it catch up to me.  Thank you all for everything.  I look forward to talking with you all again.  carol",

Stay strong all we are in this to win.  As Gerigrace said we will be stronger from this.  We are going to help others through this. Angela I draw blood on cancer patients it is very hard to see that everyday when you are going through this, your MO is wise.  Im off for 3 months.  I think we as women just dont take the time to care of ourselves.  Its our time. Twohobbies I second that on the chemo chores.  My first today so next time I will add some and scratch some. Rambo good to hear you teaching schedule will work for you. And pray your WBCs stay up Poconos3 So glad you have a good MO now. The team of drs works so well and makes you feel alot more confortable.",

GraceB1  I draw blood at a hospital.  Alot times the port wont pull the blood out but the IVs ....work great.  I think fluids going in is better than going out for some reason.  Alot of times they have to try different things to get it to work for the blood  like take a deep breath and hold or move your arm to a different position like over your head.  I know sounds funny.  Good luck. Puppymama hop you are feeling better about things,  you are right we will get through it. Hannariggs that sounds like a good idea, getting together with friends to shave your hair.  Alot of support!  yea! nocompromises2013   playing golf!  I really want to learn.  You really live up to your name no compromises! even golf  thats great!  and great attitude!!!!",
