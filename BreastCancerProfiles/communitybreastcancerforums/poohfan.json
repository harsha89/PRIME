My first time I was quite aware of what they were doing.  I did not feel the pain you did but was quite awake and heard every word they said.  I had tears streaming down my face.  I have metastatic cancer to the bones and liver.  When I found out the second time.  My 2nd port was put in the same spot  as the first and 1 month later had to be taken out since the tip had move an inch closer to my heart.  I had to have it replace with my third port.  I am going through my third bout of cancer returning and could not imagine going through chemo without the port.  I have one good vein and it needs to be used for blood work everyother week.  I hope you get your letters done and meet with the hospital administrators but then you need to focus on your health.  I only vaguely remember that first port experience and just try to survive the getting the chemo so I can become stable once again.",
