It's not that I want to be a gawker, but that I'm curious to know that my \"new look\" isn't beyond the norm for a double mastectomy ... with or without clothes. I still find it difficult to look at my bare chest. I've gotten better about touching it because of the Bio Oil I've been applying to the incision scars. The car and trailer are packed for our move south. I probably did too much, but it's stuff that had to be done. I felt okay after a night's sleep from yesterdays packing boxes and suitcases and a bit of lifting. Still have to clean one refrigerator yet. I'm so glad to have found this forum. Thank all of you who \"listen\" and for replies to my concerns and rants.",

I'm grateful for all this. Is it that I just need patience with the baby steps to fully recover? I keep reminding myself there were two surgeries with only six weeks between them and that the anesthetic has lingering effects ... especially a foggy brain, which I think is getting better.",

I just want to get on \"with it\", as I'm sure everyone wants to do as well. Sigh!!!  We are in the process of moving from our summer to winter residence. There is no escape from packing and lifting for me. It's been 2 months since my BMX. Can I do any damage internally? My surgeon at last weeks appointment said there are no restrictions on weight to lift. However, I feel a pull inside and a bit of pain ... and I'm not lifting the really heavy stuff and am holding the load close to my body/chest. Well, on to cleaning out 2 refrigerators before today is over ... hate that job ;-(",

I know how fortunate I am to NOT have had to go through chemotherapy or radiation and wish it were so for all of us. I'm feeling okay. There's a still a tightened band feeling across my chest as well as the feeling of contractions in the area from under one arm across to the other. The sharp pains as well as the hyper sensitivity when I drink something hot or cold have diminished. Also, my memory is a lot less fuzzy. For sometime now if someone where to ask me how I feel compared to yesterday, my answer would be \"the same.\" However, if I think about how I'm feeling compared to a week or a month ago, I'm feeling a lot better.",

I've been searching the web for any information about some issues after my dbl mastectomy/no reconstruction on August 15th.  I've found quiet a few answers here ... WHEW, again! and Thank you! Earlier in June I had a lumpectomy on my left breast when it was determined there was no lymphnode involvement, but more cancer beyond the edges and in the milk ducts. After a meeting with a mult-specialty team of doctors, I decided to reduce my chances of more surgery for recurring cancer as well as to skip chemo and radiation treatments. I also decided against reconstruction. I'm 70 years old. My breasts had served their purpose of nursing babies and enhancing my sexuality. At this age I just want to \"get on with it.\" In reality I'm finding the reality of doing that more difficult than expected. My biggest concern right now is fat necrosis. There are \"dog ear\" flaps (Dr's term) under my arms. They feel like water balloons and one of them feels more solid than the other. Plus, I feel like there's a tight band across my chest. In places along that band it feels firm/hard, plus there's a tightness. I saw my surgeon this past Thursday who said it's all fat necrosis and will soften up in 3-4 months. The flaps under my arms have softened a bit. Initially I could not lay on my side, but now can. I think I've read all the posts about fat necrosis on this site. However, I could not reference the paper about it that's been mentioned.  I'd like to hear from anyone who has/had those \"balloons\" hanging under the arms at breast level. Again, thanks to all of you who post here.",

I thank all of you have posted to give me more knowledge to help me get used to and accepting of this \"new normal.\" As many of you know, this doesn't mean there aren't or won't be complications down the line. One that's happening since New Year's Day is that I've developed more patches of psoriasis on my torso. From what I've learned in the \"Hormonal Therapy -before, during and after\" thread, they're most likely drug induced by the Anastrozole. Now to change that appointment with my oncologist that's 6 weeks away to get it checked it. The change in my attitude means that I'm not stressed out and bummed by this.",

I was pretty sure the holidays would \"do me in,\" but happily it didn't. It surprised me that I had no problems navigating air and bus travel. Also, that I was not \"done in\" by the activities and rambunctioness of my grandchildren, plus cooking several meals for my son's family. I got tired, but not exhausted. It was a pleasure to wake up New Year's morning with a feeling that this day was a \"crest\" ... a feeling of physically and emotionally being over the \"hump.\" Hope that feeling lasts ... so far, so good ;-))",
