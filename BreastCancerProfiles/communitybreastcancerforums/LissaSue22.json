I had no plans of radiation no matter what, so the best course of action for me was mastectomy. My recovery and reconstruction process has been drama free, and it's all worth the peace of mind knowing that the cancer is finally removed completely, no radiation needed, and no more mammos! I am happy with my decision. It was the right one for me. I allowed myself two full months after my last failed lumpectomy to make said decision, to count the cost, etc., and I am at complete peace with my course of action.Â ",
