My mamm and us showed a 2.3 cm lesion but no signs of malignancy so you can only imagine my surprise when a core biopsey said cancer. I have been on a rollercoater of emotions as well, i am 44 with 4 kids and a wonderful husband I am trying to be the strong one for them but then i go to work and close my door only to cry all day, I keep asking myself really? this happening. I am having a lumpectomy on Friday with lymphnode dissection, the girls on this site have given me so much encouragement. I have been told that soon when I know my treatment I will learn to breath again. I am so sorry you are travelling this road, but its only a bump, we will get through this. hang in there and I pray soon you will feel some calm and be able to breath. Big hugs coming your way, please keep us updated, and I am sure you will get some strenghth from these amazing women, I know i have xoxoxoxo Becca",

I know where you are at, I feel exactly how your feeling. Its a struggle to focus and do things. I still have so many fears of what to expect after and what they will tell me after they removeFred, but right now my entire focus is getting him the hell out of my body. Its weird I watch everyone around me as if its through a glass door, everyone making plans and doing things, unlimited possibilities. That will be us again soon. We have to keep our faith and move forward, we can do it together, one step at a time. Lots of hugs Melinda, Try and have a nice Sunday <3",
