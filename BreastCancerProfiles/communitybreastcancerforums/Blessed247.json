I am 46 and like you I am not fond of doctors, but went for my wellness checkup & mammogram never dreaming they would never see anything. Had my first mammogram on a Wednesday got a call on Monday to be back Tuesday. After the second mammogram the Doctor reading it came in and recommended getting on top of it and scheduled a biopsy. I will go on Tuesday the 18th. The waiting is so hard",
