I have to tell anyone facing surgery, go to town and by yourself a sports type bra that zips or snaps int he front.  Mine has been a lifesaver as far as helping with the pain.  I took it off this morning to take a shower and reliezed how I would feel without it.  I couldn't wait to get it back on.  I got mine at JC Penneys. I now have to have radiation.  If anyone  out there has had it, please let me know what to expect.  I am a little scared about it, but if I have to do it I will.   Thank you Barb T Log in to post a reply",
