The chemo happened so fast and the cancer diagnosis was so overwhelming, even the simplest of instructions or information was hard to absorb. I am now at the point where I can say I have breast cancer without my voice quivering and my eyes welting. Today I went to a free class run by beauty expert volunteers at the BC Cancer Agency, called Look Good, Feel Better. Not sure if this is a Canadian program or they have it in the US. It is sponsored by Shoppers Drug Mart, Estee Lauder, Elizabeth Grant and many, many others. If anyone has a chance to go, I highly recommend it. They go over skin care (esp for dry skin with cancer), make up , wigs, hair scarves. It was nice to meet and exchange information with other women that have cancer. In Canada, for program information call 1-800-914-5665. They give a ton of free really nice cosmetics and creams donated by sponsors. I am not a big make up person, but I felt great after the session. Some things I learned is not to use Johnson baby shampoo on your scalp. They recommend continuing to wash your hair with shampoo to massage the scalp, but the baby shampoo is not formulated for adults and dries the skin. One participant had a nasty rash on her head from the baby shampoo and was taking antibiotics. Another thing about hair that you see on You tube videos is people shaving it all off. That is not recommended. There are scissors to buy at the drugstore (or go to the hairdresser) that have a 1 inch (or 2 inch, etc) guards that cut the hair shorter. I can`t quite picture what these scissors look like. Your hair needs to fall out on its own. And when the 1st hairs grow back (chemo hair) it should be cut off so the real hair can grown in. ",

At that time, my hair wasn`t my usual hair. When I washed it, it became matted right away. I wished I buzzed mine, I left it for the bangs to hang out of my scarf, big mistake, because as I became bald I had unsightly patches all over my head giving off that same smell. I`m on a similar tx (Paclitaxel).",

      "Content": "May 16, 2016 11:48PM - edited May 17, 2016 01:12AM by JuicyFruit Hi all, These boards have been a Godsend. I have been lurking for months. I am so thankful to you for all the information and stories and the shopping lists, makes it less scary and makes me feel more in control and less alone. I have stage 3 breast cancer and am getting a PET scan at the end of the month to see if it has spread outside the lymph nodes. I started chemo May 9th to try to shrink the tumor before surgery could be an option. I started on the P mixture of the AC-P combo because if the cancer has spread then at least the P part would be helpful. I hear people talk about Taxol and I think that is what the P is. The 1st chemo went well, took about 4 hours but the time flew with the nice volunteers who dropped in for conversations and to offer coffee, and they gave me a medication to prevent any allergic reactions whick made me drowsy so I slept a bit, especially with the hot blanket. The only reaction I had was about 12 hours later my hands were a bit numb and tingly but that only lasted about 3 hours. The next 3 days, I was a little spacey and tired but struggled through my work days. I am self employed so need to work. I had to inject Neuprogen for 5 days following chemo and surprisingly injecting the needle was ok, but it was hard to draw up the medication from the vial to the syringe. So much for the aeseptic techniques - the vial landed on the bathroom floor many times. Main side effects are: hard to sleep, foggy mind, change in bowel habits. One nice thing about starting on the P-cycle is that my hair won`t fall out. My cousin is getting married at the end of the month, so this was good news. Dreading the AC-cycle but will enjoy what I have now and face that later. Again, thank you for all the information and support.   ",
