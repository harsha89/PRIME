He said it was highly unlikely that I was developing lymphedema since the radiation wasn't going in the area of my lymph nodes, but they would keep measuring my arm. Last night, my left fingers were so swollen my ring had left an indention, yet my right side was fine. Thanks Binney for the websites. I've been reading and I at least know what to watch for now. Thank-you's to this board!",

I was fine while during all the visits to the hosptial, but I can't seem to get relaxed at this new place. Had I been able to travel to the hospital to get treatments (2 hrs. away), it would have been 18 treatments (15 with 3 boosts), but at the new place, their standard is 33 treaments (30 with 3 boosts).  I haven't been able to mentally accept the difference in length. I can seem to hold it together until I get in the car. I'm hoping it will get easier.",

I've been using cornstarch, but after a few hours I can smell my underarms even when I lift them slightly.  Whoa -- the smell is actually giving me a headache. I only hug with my right side now because I don't want other people to smell me. I meet with the dr. on Mondays. I explained that I had already felt some SE's such as tingling on the inside the breast, which worries me since it's so early in my treatments. As the day goes on, it turns into a dull throb.  I try not to think about how bad this could get. The nurse is the only one who has described the SE's close to what I've been reading about. The dr.'s have said a mild to bad sunburn - nothing about internal pain. And, although they say you can't feel the treatment, I know I can feel it when it's given on my left-most side (I get whole breast radiation). I can't bring myself to open my eyes and watch. God bless all of you. I'm so thankful for this group.",

When I went for my simulation, I had a cloth over my chest with my arms in stirrups. My eyes were closed and I didn't realize the techs were going to pull the cloth off in front of so many people (there were 3 in the room and two more one the other side of the window, one was the machine rep- I felt like screaming). I jerked my arms completely out of the stirrups to cover myself. I know they thought I was crazy. At UNC, it was like I was anonymous and would probably never see those people in public. But at the clinic (local), it's different. There's a male tech, too and I can't seem to adjust to that. He's nice, but I just don't feel comfortable.  It's weird - after my surgery, I would make jokes with the kids about not making me mad during radiation or I might turn into the Hulk, but once I started reading about symtoms and actually going to the clinic, it wasn't funny anymore. I cried all the time. This week has been much better. In fact, today was #7 of 33 and I haven't cried since Thursday. There was a bridal shower for my son's fiance on Friday and I felt so much better. I think focusing on someone else helped me. In fact, I stood up in church Sunday and apologized if I had snapped at anyone lately.  I had begun to let bitterness creep in and had been getting a little rude with people. The week earlier I had been somewhat abrupt (in front of the whole church) when someone wanted to pray for my family. I was terrible. They are loving and forgiving people, though. So many keep asking if I need a ride to tx's. There's a song by Casting Crown, Praise You in this Storm and I keep it in my head and remind myself I'm not really alone. I seem to be adjusting better.  I can't express enough thanks to this board - I've learned more here than from any pamphlet. I'm experiencing some really nasty heartburn. I'm trying to watch what I eat, but I don't know if it's a SE, nerves or what.",

Earlier tonight, one of my friends brought me a Susan Komen pillow. It's been a very special day and I feel like God knew I would need this because I just found the itchy spots have begun to blister.

While I was in the waiting room for radiation, a male patient came. I was in the gown with my bag over my chest. I don't what I was thinking - I should have known that there would be other people waiting for treatments. I guess I was expecting only women. I felt so exposed. The nurse noticed and offered to let me go in an empty waiting room and from now on they would let me when I was next and I could change then. I went to Wal-mart and got one of those tops that medical personnel wear; took it apart and fit it with a camisole. Added snaps in the front from the shoulder down to my side and secured with a button. On Friday, I wore it in and was ready. I had practiced the night before how I could keep myself covered until I was able to get on the table and close my eyes. It really helped me. I felt like I had some control over what was happening. In fact, there were more people in the radiation waiting area (patients and their friends and family) and I felt somewhat comfortable and relaxed. I had begun to feel like my dignity was being stripped away.  I have been keeping a mental note on how many have seen my breast and was getting somewhat bitter. The radiation part has been the only thing that seems to break me down. Even when I was researching and reading about it, I would start crying. Yet until then, I had been somewhat upbeat and encouraging - from diagnosis through surgery. Looneymom- I asked about the difference in treatments from 33 to 18. The hospital's radiation oncologist (18 treatments, but 2 hrs away) said the amount of dosage would be same in the end and not to worry, but, along with my surgeon, thought that based on the size (6mm, DCIS) the shorter treatments would be best. The local center said that based on my condition , it was standard to do 33 treatments and that would be the same throughout my local area.",

I've notice some on my left side, but not the right. My arm feels tired, heavy and tight.  I asked the dr. and they're taking measurements to watch it. He said it probably wasn't lymphedema because the treatments aren't for my nodes. I may seem more sensitive to my left side, but I want to be sure. I'm having whole breast radiation and my \"pink\" lines go pretty close to my underarm. Trying not to be frustrated. I had just gotten where I could go on with my day after tx, but now I find myself looking up info. and watching for SE's. Tomorrow's Friday!! I hope everyone has a good weekend.",

But to be honest, mentally I've never been much after 9pm, so the conversations have been getting quite comical. Last Sunday, I asked my son to set up the ironing machine. Another one was to get the groceries out the garage (we don't have a garage). The kids just laugh and make do. Last night I went to a time management class with my sister and the speaker was talking about how time is not equal to money and asked if anyone had ever been really sick because most people would not ask for more money, but for more time - that time was equal to life.That really stuck with me. So, tomorrow instead of cleaning the yard, we're taking the kids and going to a local festival.  I've also made a deal with myself that on every Friday I buy a new tube of lipstick (the cheap stuff) or nail polish and use it over the weekend. Here's an idea  for the one's with a long drive - we use audiobooks (from the library) on long trips and it really makes the drive go by pretty fast.",
