I know that is not uncommon to get a callback after a first mammogram. However, the more I thought about breast density I started thinking, \"Well, if they are not dense, shouldn't the images be pretty clear to see through?\". It is hard to find anything on the Internet regarding callbacks of women without dense breasts...so I'm curious about women with similar experience. Is there more likelihood of there being something actually there if you get a call back when your mammogram is a clearer picture due to non-dense breasts? Just curious really Log in to post a reply",
