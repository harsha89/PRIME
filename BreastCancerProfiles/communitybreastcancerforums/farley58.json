All I want is small rounded pieces of foam rubber I can sew into my bras and as much cotton as I can find in the bra and cover without going to the poor house. I bought a pillow form and tried to cut out my own but they weren't thick enough. I'm going to keep shopping until I find the right pieces of foam and they will be cheap and wonderful. Goodbye to all those companies who want to make us survivors feel like they care about us while they are fleecing us.",
