I called the Diagnostic office she referred me to and they said because of my age I would need to have an ultrasound first. Needless to say, I thought my Dr would tell me everything was fine and now Im needing tests. I have been a mess ever since. I have four young children 10 to 5 years old. Worrying is the absolute worse...that and googling symptoms! I just wanted to say that I wish Saizjj99 and you all the best. If you would, please keep me in your prayers!",
