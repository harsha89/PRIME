I really really appreciate the replies and the raw honesty you have all provided. A few of you asked what treatments I have had so far, so I asked my metastatic breast nurse to provide this information to me so I could respond accurately. Please note that this treatment has occurred only in the last 2 1/2 years, previous to this treatment I\u2019ve had 12 surgeries, which included a lumpectomy, breast conserving surgery to find safe margins, of which there weren\u2019t. Mastectomy, hysterectomy, nearly died from golden staphylococcus, 6 months of aggressive chemotherapy, radiotherapy, diep tram flap surgery, god the list goes on. For this forum though these are the treatments over the last two odd years: April 2015 Letrozole(Femara) hormonal therapy March 2016 Exemestane (Aromasin)- hormonal therapy April 2017 Capecitabine(Xeloda) \u2013 chemotherapy tablets November 2017 Cyclophosphamide/Methotrexate -chemotherapy tablets plus Faslodex Injections \u2013hormonal therapy Ongoing monthly Denosumab (Xgeva) injection for bone metastasises....... I\u2019ve made my decision. What sealed the deal is today\u2019s chance meeting ..... For the first time ever (its as though something was sending me a sign/message) I got into a lift at my hospital to attend an appointment, the lift was full, but I noticed a lady similar in age to me, standing next to her mother. She had no hair, looking very unwell (like we have all experienced) with a port on her chest and the surrounding area so inflamed and sore. We exited the lift on the same level and I pulled her aside and told her my story, seeking some form of honesty from her current situation to help me in my decisions. This beautiful lady has the same cancer as us, she had her port put in 3 weeks ago, during the last 3 weeks she has spent 7 days in hospital fighting infections and feeling extremely sick. She too has been told that her treatment may not even give her 1 more day in this world, however, she has a 4 and 6 year old. If she didn\u2019t, if her babies were older, then she wouldn\u2019t be putting herself through this suffering she said Many may think I\u2019m giving up, but I\u2019m not. I want to live my life, as I always have, to the fullest. How can I possibly do that when I am poisoning my body with no guarantee that it is even going to give me 1 more day. My best friend Steven wrote to me today, it\u2019s very profound: Darling Odette, I am reminded of my favourite saying \" life is a banquet and most poor suckers are starving to death\" I am also reminded of Julia Roberts in Steel Magnolias, \"momma, I'd rather have 30 seconds of something wonderful than a lifetime of nothing special\" I expected your decision, and I'm proud of you for choosing to live rather than exist, and be a person LIVING with Cancer and not a person DYING from Cancer. Take away the disease's power over you and your life and then you truly have won the war! Love always XxS I know this is so emotional for everyone on this site, but you are the only ones that can understand what I\u2019m going through. I value and encourage any comments, both negative and positive from you. After all, if we can\u2019t say it how it is after living with metastatic cancer, then we will never be able to! Love odette x",

Unfortunately this is not currently available in Australia so I would have to travel to Europe as a private patient which would be at my own expense and I\u2019m sure you can imagine the costs associated with that. It\u2019s not viably possible for me unfortunately.",
