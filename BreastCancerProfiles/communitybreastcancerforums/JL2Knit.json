I am just surprised how long it takes. BTW - I slept in my recliner for a few weeks, but eventually found bed pretty inviting...it just takes me awhile to get the right position. Usually by then the one pain med I take kicks in thank heavens! I'm going to check about Physical therapy - it just might be what I need. I do do my exercises - maybe a few new ones would do the trick. Thanks to each of you for responding. I'm so sorry we have to face this - but am glad we're here together to share. I am most grateful.",

      "Content": "JL2Knit wrote: I need a Bilateral Mastectomy mentor - My story: Invasive Ductual Carcimona DX in left breast - October 2008 I had a bilateral mastecomy January 15th. Only immediate problem was a bad reaction to pain meds. Nodes clear. \"Suspicious cells\" in right breast. Did the right thing - Hurray! Started Tamoxifin two weeks ago. My Concerns: 1. My underarms and the circle under where my breasts were are hard as rocks. There is a rope like structure that follows under the breast line. They hurt and are hard. Larger areas in my arm pit. I assume it is \"dead fat\" - will this eventually go away? My surgeon has suggested \u2018clean up' surgery - which I don't have time for and can't afford. 2. When I sweat - (my deodorant doesn't seem to be working, especially on my right side) - it stings and burns. This started right away and continues. I've tried baby powder, different brands of deodorant, going without - nothing seems to work. 3. Cramping - suddenly my entire chest gets hard and cramps - (Yes I've been doing my exercises and massage) - It's not the scars themselves (they're fine) - but underneath and especially the \"rope\" 4. One side is very different (the non cancer side) - part of the tissue looks like it is closer to the chest wall - it's tighter and it pulls more. The cancer side actually looks like I would expect it to - although neither side is really flat - due to those \u2018ropes' 5. Although my reach gets better every day - I'm not really complaining about that - but I still hurt every day. I'm 7 weeks out and can't believe I'm still dealing with all this discomfort. I know I'm not 12 anymore (although I have the figure of a 12 year old! Well sort of :(.....maybe more like a 50 year old man with a slight beer belly - oh those pregnancies - got to love em!). I can't comfortably turn my torso - you know to look behind you before you make a turn in the car - stuff like that - it hurts! 6. I am so tired of trying to sleep on my back - sleeping on my side still hurts - once again it feels like I'm trying to sleep with a rope under me! 7. Luckily I don't seem to have any side effects from the tamoxifin...I'm post menopausal and didn't have hot flashes anyway (a few times maybe). Chose tamoxifin over arimidex because of cost and oncologist said it's better for my bones anyway. I am concerned about \u2018dry skin' - which has always been a problem and frankly I think my face looks older these days. 8. I still haven't found clothing that is comfortable for the entire day - or even a few hours. When I get home from work the first thing I do is change my shirt. I feel exposed too - the thought of a bra or anything restricting just doesn't work. A camisole under my shirt initially feels OK - but then the irritation begins. What am I going to do this summer when sweaters aren't an option. I'm not really concerned about being flat - I could care less - especially if I were flatter instead of this lumpy look. Right now it's just the physical discomfort of the exposure. 9. Obviously the best part is I AM CANCER FREE, I will never have to do this again, I never have to have a mammogram again. I don't need Chemo or Rads - thank goodness! I don't mind not having breasts but I'm really tired of being constantly reminded by this discomfort. 10. I know my expectations were much too high - but how was I supposed to know different. All these great message boards and really very little is written about the physical discomfort and how long it lasts. I really had no idea. My surgeon tells me it's typical and I'm fine - I just don't feel fine and I'm tired of it! So any suggestions, any help would be greatly appreciated. I must say that I have a terrific \"Navigator\" from our own local Breast Cancer program - but she only had a single mastectomy - and I think my experience is a little different. She has been wonderful and I think this is a great program. I'd love to \"Navigate\" another, but working full time plus just wouldn't allow me to provide the kind of support necessary. Once again, thanks to all who respond. Support is such a gift and I am so very appreciative. Log in to post a reply",
