I just hit 40 this year and started my mammogram like a good woman wanting to be safe. My first mammogram gave me a Birads 3 follow up in 6 months and now I have been moved to 4. I just received the news Friday so I\u2019m hoping to get a call today to book the stereotactic biopsy. I am physically sick to my stomach. I have 2 kids at home, 16 and 12 and just keep thinking to my self this isn\u2019t suppose to happen until they are older, moved out, married. I know this is early detection if the news comes back not b9 but it still really really suck",

I had my first mammogram a month prior to my 40th birthday. Was given a Birad 3 and told to come back in 6 months. I\u2019m now a Birad 4 and waiting for a stereotactic biopsy. ( mine is dec 20th) it sucks that it will fall over Christmas so the wait will be longer but I\u2019m not sure if I would want to know before Christmas anyway. My report stated I have a group of 6 calcifications in a tight cluster with a combined diameter of 2.5mm. Change since last report and slightly pleomorphic. It states low grade DCIS is not excluded. I think we can all agree this sucks to deal with but we are all strong women that will get though whatever comes our way.",

Yesterday my dr called and said no cancer woohoo, I think that was all I heard. She had also mentioned dysplasia but I honestly was so focused on the no cancer. She did say they where able to get everything they needed in my biopsy. Told me to have a relaxing Christmas and come see her in January to talk and that I would be needing additional screening in the future. Then I started to google and feel back to square one. Isn\u2019t this really a pre cancer. Log in to post a reply",

Her office is closed now until after New Years so I have to wait and wonder. I know it is still best case scenario but again my Brain goes to dark places.",
