My doc told me not to expect quick results that this medication is slow acting so it could take up to two months for me to see a difference. I am finally getting relief in my hands but not my feet. Of course i do have it pretty bad.  I will be going to a neurologist on the 28 and i am hoping he has some other ideas. I do sleep well on this and i love that. It does make me clumsy though. I also take all of mine at night in one shot. I hope this helps you out.",
