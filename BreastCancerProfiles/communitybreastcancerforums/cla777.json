The dr. only biopsied the cluster of pleomorphic calcifications. He said he was more concerned with them than the hypoechoic solid, irregular mass that was found in the ultrsound. He said he wanted to make sure that this was not cancer first. He said that he could do a biopsy on the mass later. I dont know why he could'nt do them both at once?",
