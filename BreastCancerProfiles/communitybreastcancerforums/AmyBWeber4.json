I'm expecting B9 results based on conversations with radiologist and BS. I'm also expecting more testing...found another lump after the biopsy. Waiting sucks...really really stressful. This has been a huge eye opener for me...no more missed mamos and I'll be feelin for bumps. Amazing women on here...huh? I hope you get good news tomorrow! Please keep us all posted.",
