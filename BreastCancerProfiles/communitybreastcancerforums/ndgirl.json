I had a very hard time deciding between mx and lumpectomy but finally chose mx, just to ease my mind that hopefully all cells would be gone with the boob.. we never know tho but we never have any guarantees in anything.. sending big hugs to you!!! these boards are wonderful for everything, we can vent when we are angry, share when excited or happy and share our feeling, hopes everything here. It has been such a tremenous help for me, a good therapy! Take big deep breaths, hold for a few seconds and blow out slowly thru your mouth, it does help relieve stress! Stay positive but you dont always have to be strong either, have a good cry when you need it, but dont let it be the thing you always want to do. We are all here for you!  Love from Linda",

The other breast now gave me the trouble. Always be your own advocate and ask lots of ????",

They explained what was happening and why, told me some ladies find them painful but most dont and I sure did not enjoy it, but was nothing I have bad memories of, just a few stings. Ask for the numbing cream, it helps, but I hope you dont worry too much about these, they do not last long either. Good luck. keep us posted!",

There is a radiation called \"proton therapy\" that is available in only a few places in us, Mayo will start it next year, think MD Anderson has it now. It is used in Germany and European countries now, we know a young man that is involved with the process and is really singing the praises, it is meant to target areas and not damage other tissues as much, I asked about it at Mayo and they seem very optimistic but at this time insurance wouldnt cover me for it.. hopefully more will be discovered shortly. I have my 4 month checkup on Wed. and I am getting nervous about it, just going to the onocology floor, havent quite wrapped my head around all this yet!  Barbie.. agreed.. well said!",

I started arimidex the first of May, I cant begin to tell you how scared and worried I was about taking this.. but so far not too bad. No side effects at first but the last 2 weeks I think the fatique has set in, not every day but when it hits it hits hard, just knocks me down for the whole day! But I also tend to overdue, I just go too much and hard and guess my body tells me to slow up, am hoping this doesnt last. But  5 years taking a drug is a long time and sure hope it does what they say it will. Good luck to you!",
