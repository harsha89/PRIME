Carol, if you've got bras you love from your pre-surgery collection - TAKE THEM WITH YOU!!  Nordie's will sew pockets in your existing bras for your form(s) so you can keep those naughty nothings in use.  have loads of fun, and I'll certainly pick your brain tomorrow night. sleep well everyone, and thank you again for being willing to share.

I will be doing 4 rounds of AC, followed by 4 rounds of Taxol, with a shot of Neulasta the day after each treatment.  I'm getting rather anxious about the Neulasta pain issues I'm reading about, but not about to pass it up, given its other benefits.  I'd like to know what your issues have been with each drug, and what worked for you to alleviate it.  the issues I've been picking up on (in no particular order) are mouth sores, constipation, dragging fatigue, body and muscle pains, sleep deprivation, taste alterations and loss of appetite.  oddly enough, I don't recall much discussion of nausea - do the meds work that well?  I have sensitivity issues with Benadryl, so any alternative suggestions there would be helpful too. I've come across a few references to a \"chemo bag\" as well.  what do you take to your treatments that helps?  how much water do you drink and when?  I've seen discussions of as much as 1.5 gallons a day - is that only the day before, of and after chemo, or is that every day?  I already drink about 90 oz a day, and frankly I'm not sure I can double that on a daily basis. thanks in advance, and my apologies for the long ramble and request for assistance.  feel free to PM me rather than take up discussion space here, since these are issues you've all figured out.  thanks again, both for the answers and just for being here.  be well...

Vettegal, would you share the name (screen or real) of the lady you met and sent to the March thread?  I'd like to make sure she gets welcomed specifically, since it can be intimidating to hop into the middle of something that looks established. may your water be sweet, and the fire within remain a metaphor.  sleep well...",
