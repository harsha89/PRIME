She Had mastectomy on right breast, the cancer was also in her lymphatic channel. her cancer score for reoccurance was 21. she will be completing her 4th round of AC this monday. She has been having very bad headaches, some migraines off and on for the last 2 months, my question is, is it possible for this stage and grade of B/C able to metasticise to the brain. The doctor said she shouldn`t be having headaches from the chemo, and if they persisted they would do a CTscan, any info would any of you have would be helpful. Thanks, Deb   Log in to post a reply",
