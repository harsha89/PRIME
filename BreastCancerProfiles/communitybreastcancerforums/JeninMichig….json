However you do deserve someone who truly loves you and someone who is strong enough to be your man. And please do not despair. I was in your boat and we have a similar pathology. I have been NED now for five years and for the last year and a half had been dating a pretty good guy who knew full well about my disease. I recently called it off and not him. There is much hope for your health and your love life. You deserve the very best. And while you are going through treatment your focus should be on you and how you cope. You shouldn't have to expend energy tending to your bf's need. He should be lifting you up and strong for you instead of the other way around. Tough times tell just how solid your relationship really is and how strong your man is (or in this case isn't). Don't settle for less just because of your diagnosis. Sending a warm hug and much hope for the future. Jennifer",

Since I have had no lymphademia my onc approved using that hand.  If I need to, I can always get another put in.   As squeamish as I am about getting IVs out in, I still am happier without my port.   And also found out I have scar tissues and a thinning of my jugular vein which is where they ran it. So must have been a reason it hurt.   I don't regret it at all    Jennifer",

Battle - \"sustained fight\"  or \"to resist something\" Fight - \"violent confrontation or struggle\" Survivor - \"copes well with a difficult situation\" or \"stays alive after an event in which others have died\" I understand the terminology.   I think the context in which it is used and how it is sensationalized is what really bothers me.  \"oh she is heroically battling ... cancer\"    I don't consider myself a warrior or anything dramatic like that.   I am not brave or inspirational.  We are only dealing with the bad hand we were dealt and trying to live as best we can for as long as we can.   On the other hand, I am battling my cancer in that I am doing anything and everything I can to stop if from progressing.  So I am indeed resisting it although fully realizing that I am not in control really what happens.  But this is my personal battle that only 2-3 people know anything about.      I will not draw my pink sword though and declare my self a surviving warrior and might well punch someone in the nose who labels me as such!! I don't know the right words really to talk about what we go through.   It isn't brave because any one of use would not sign up for this and if we could run and get away from it... every one of us would put our tails between our legs and bolt.     I just hate anyone sensationalizing the horror of cancer.  We don't want to be put on a pedastal with a crown and a sash saying \"warrior\" or \"Miss Inspirational 2014\" just use the energy and find a cure.  Jennifer   ",

We also have 14 cats (they are barn kitties), 1 rabbit, and 12 chickens. My 10 year old daughter is slowing talking me into getting a horse. I had horses when I was married but got rid of them with the husband. I thought it was a brilliant move on both and saved me a ton of heartache and work. I think last year when I was going through chemo my great dane, Hallie, really helped me through it. I got up and walked her nearly every single night. She insisted on it and it made me keep moving which in the end helped my energy. Animals are so therapeutic. Wish i could figure out how to add pictures. Jennifer",

Also, when you got to get your chemo, ask them to give you some Lidocaine cream.   Put it on about an hour before they access it and cover it with saran wrap.   You won't feel anything at all when they use it.  Getting it in isn't a big deal.   Just a little sore afterward.   Jennifer ",

Part of my way of reducing stress has been simply avoiding situations that I know will evoke stress. I don't engage in political or religious discussions where I used to love a great political debate. I don't participate in online drama and it is in large why I won't even date anymore. I really am after a simple life because I have had way too many years of the opposite. So I know that sitting through a discussion on how to plan for those golden years and making sure I have enough to live on when I retire would be hard. I already know my finances are messy and I don't have anything extra to put away. I think this discussion is untimely as we all just took a huge increase in health insurance premiums and I cannot imagine the average Joe in this meeting will have much extra in their budgets to put away for retirement. I might talk to our controller on the down low and see what she thinks since she set up the meeting. I love to get information on what is available to me but I really don't want to be a bundle of tension verging on crying in a meeting. Thanks for giving me something more to ponder than just an escape. Jennifer",

When they did the pet they found 4 tumors on my liver, most of my right ribs and left hip with mets. I also think during my lumpectomy that my grade 3 Her2+ cancer went gangbusters spreading around. Anyway, my onc said she was going to treat me just as aggressive as if I had stage 2b. All that aggressive treatment and radiation took me quickly to NED. The bonus of have mets from the start is that I keep getting treatment and so far, it hasn't come back. I often wonder if I responded so well that my cancer hasn't been able to dodge the Herpceptin. Where if I stopped Herceptin after a year, would it have had the time to redevelop and come back stronger/smarter than the drugs. I sort of agree with the 100% or 0. Cancer is so sneaky though and highly different for each person and situation. This is why I really love the MBC project and the patient focused research. Don't lump us all together.

WTH .. I ran out of there and never looked back.  I asked my current oncologist and she said absolutely not.  You will get as aggressive of chemo as you would if you were stage II.   Now your reaction to the chemo versus any early stage patient, is anyones guess.  But to answer what I think is your question, the protocol shouldn't be less aggressive than what you would get at an early stage.   Lower the doses crosses all the stages and depends on how you tolerate the drugs.  Jennifer",

I finished my chemo and continued with Herceptin and Aredia (for bone mets). I also did a year of Tykerb. I am just on Herceptin now and it has been over 8 years. I am still NED and with the exception of infusions every three weeks, I live a pretty normal life. Like the other ladies said, keep track of your test results and know the drugs you are taking and the side effects. I wish you the same outstanding results that I have experienced.

On the blood draws, I got a script for Lidocaine from my onc and I put it on my arm.  Sounds pretty whimpy but I get sick of getting stuck all the time.   I put it on my port for infusions too.  don't feel a thing.    I never ever watch and usually the lab tech is very talkative which helps alot.   Hope you are better next time around.

Oh and don't worry about the liver biopsy too much.  It isn't nearly as bad as it sounds.    As them to give you as much \"dope\" as they can to relax you.  You have to be awake and able to hold your breath but it is quick and not very painful.   I had my self so upset and really it wasn't too bad.   I think the thought of having it done and why is way worse than the actual procedure.    Throughout the first year of my treatment I took Adavan regularly for anxiety and it was truly a Godsend.   Jennifer",

I think you will find many women here with weight gain especially around the middle.  I had liver mets too but I don't really think it is the organ involvement that directly affects the weight gain.   The issue I think is the hormonals you are on.  I am on Tamoxifen and over the last three years have steadily put on weight to the tune of 26 pounds in total.   I done many different diets.   The South Beach diet was the most successful for losing the belly weight but only 14 pounds of it.   I work out with a cardio combat fitness glass 3-4 days a week and walk/run on the treadmill two others days and this weight is so stubborn.   I feel like I am fighting a losing battle.   Carbs are the ultimate enemy it seems.    I wish it were water weight but at least in my case it absolutely is just fat.

Most of us have been offered some kind of alternative treatment that would miraculously save our lives. Hard not to wonder what would happen if you would forgo the harsh chemo drugs. While I am all in on complementary treatment, I am not in enough not to get medical drugs. However, that being said I have made some decisions to stop my AI treatment as the side effects where wreaking havoc on my quality of life. Instead I opted to be able to vigorously exercise and adopt a clean diet. However, I am only mildy ER positive and my have been NED for a long time. The one thing about most medical doctors that irritates me is that they are not well educated on diet, supplements and complementary options. My first oncologist dismissed supplements all together and told me take nothing ... not even a multivitamin - while on chemo/radiation. I went to the University of Michigan and they were completely fine with my very long list of supplements and further offered me a consult with a nutritionist. Too many medical doctors are quick so just say no and not even consider the benefit of supplements. How great it would be if our medical doctors were willing to work with naturalists to give us every benefit possible. Jennifer",

I had a wlll made and took care of all that stuff that maybe should have been done regardless. After that, I chose to put dying aside and concentrate on living. I made some deliberate changes in my life - not in grasping at survivorship but just to try to live a healthier life and to stay as strong as possible (diet, exercise, reducing stress). It may take antidepressants, counseling, etc but getting out from under the dark cloud really helps. There are things that take you back to a little place of darkness ... wondering if that pain or cough is progression... but trying to keep is mostly in check is what gets you though. Since I have been diagnosed I have gone on wonderful vacations, moved, leased my third car, gotten a promotion, seen my daughter graduate and hoping to see the next one do so next year. It doesn't have to be a death sentence. Having a doctor who will answer your questions and learning about your disease and treatment option helped me feel like there is some control to what could happen. Lots of us living long and productive lives. Be one of us and know that it is possible! Jen",

The side effects of the drugs we take often do us more harm than the cancer itself. You may well be having side effects specific to you from the drug combination that are not on the \"common side effects\" list associated with the drugs. Arimidex gave me high blood pressure and extreme insomnia to the point I was barely functioning. Aromisin wasn't any better for me. I did much better on Tamoxifen. Right now I chose to take no anti hormonals but I am less than 5 percent ER positive and have been NED for a long time. My doctor prefers I take something but I made the choice this time. It well could be your body's reaction to the combination. I would seriously give it consideration to take a lower dose or look at Tamoxifen. I hope you get relief and a plan soon.

After three cycles, my oncologist did a pet scan and all of my tumors were resolved with no evidence of metastatic disease. I completed my chemo and then I did one year of Tykerb with the Herceptin for brain protection and have continued with Herceptin every three weeks ever since. I also took about 3 1/2 years Tamoxifen and about a year of Arimidex but I stopped the hormonals as I had bad side effects. And during all this time I was taking Aredia but am off that now too.

I have gone to many conferences and my naturalist doctor has spent hours talking with me about the pros and cons and research behind natural remedies. I haven't dismissed conventional therapy as I still get Herceptin infusions every three weeks. (although my ND has suggested it is not necessary). My medical doctor has also suggested some of the supplements are not necessary but in the end it is my decision. 7 1/2 years NED after multiple liver mets and quite a few bone mets, I feel like I have made good educated choices. The combination of the pharma drugs, herbs, supplements, moderate diet changes and significant exercise changes have all contributed to my good health rather than just luck. I would never blindly follow any medical doctor or naturalist without researching everything I take. It is well worth the time to consider all of your options. Jen",

When I was in my first chemo, my naturalist used to tell me to try to get physical activity as much as I possibly could. He said that believe it or not that moving around would actually give me more energy and do me more good than laying/sleeping. So even if I could only walk 50 feet at a time, to do that as much as I could. It was frustrating because tasks that would be easy for someone else to do, I would have to cut into blocks. Even folding laundry or putting away dishes. Also, if there are any better days during the treatment cycle, save outings for those days. Sometimes it helps to have that to look forward to. I hope that there are some decent days for her. By all means, communicate all of this to her doctor. They may be able to help tweak drugs that can help provide quality of life. Don't be shy in telling her doctor what is going on. This disease and treatment affects us all differently. Take advantage of any kind of help available include antidepressants, etc. Lots of good suggestions on making her environment comfortable and mixing it up. Interesting movies, documentaries, books, puzzles. Women are always the caretakers and it is frustrating for most of us to have to be tended to which makes it worse. My wise oncologist told me that this time is about me and this time is about your wife and concentrating on her. She is very lucky to have you to be there. I sure do hope that better days are ahead of her. Jennifer",

While you are young and you do want to be able to hit it hard.. you also want to be able to live a long life and not have the chemo disable or kill you either. It is a delicate dance between controlling the cancer and having quality of life. You have certainly been through some difficult treatment plans. The HER2 targeted drugs are very good at maintaining if you respond well and they can do this alone. Good luck to you. We don't all call it Taxoterrible for nothing. Jennifer",

Not sure if all this rambling helped at all... but at the very least I understand how you may feel doomed but I have great hope for you living many many years.   On another note, you may always feel free to vent here with us.    Jennifer",

When I was dx back in 2008 it was first through to be stage 2b. I had a lumpectomy and was getting ready for chemo and they wanted to do a pet scan to check a tiny lung nodule that appeared on my ct scan prior to surgery. The lung nodule turned out to be nothing but focal scarring but the pet scan showed multiple lesions on my liver, right ribs, hip and chest nodes. Now I am HER2+ so I really had to have chemo to go along with the Herceptin so having chemo was not a choice. However, my first oncologist said he was opting for an easier chemo protocol since we were not going for a cure anymore and just quality of life. I thankfully got a second opinion and her thoughts were that she thinks many patients who do not get pet scans are really stage IV at diagnosis and are treated successfully. She wanted to give me every opportunity to still try for a cure and ordered the same chemo that she would a stage 2b patient in addition to completing local therapy (radiation) after my lumpectomy. I did 6 cycles of chemo, several years of hormonal treatment, and have stayed on Herceptin since and am still NED now 7 1/2 years later. Again, I'll preface it by saying I had to have chemo because of the Herceptin but would you want to be treated the same as an earlier stage patient? It might be false hope or is the theory correct that many patients are not diagnosed with mets because they may not get a pet scan. Good luck with your decision.. it is not easy to say yes to chemo given the option not to do it. Jennifer",

Meditating and yoga are great tools. Music is very helpful too.   I fought the idea of giving my youngest meds but finally quality of her life was taking a hit with the anxiety and a lose dose of Prozac has changed her life.   The emotional and mental toll of cancer is huge and sometimes this is one area our docs miss in treatment.  Anxiety is taxing on your body and good for you addressing it.  Don't be afraid to get help through meds.     Jen",
