The speed of your response isn't going to turn a non cancer into cancer but it could mean a cancer gets the opportunity to grow. Speed is everything when cancer is on board. Hopefully u will rush towards a benign conclusion and so really can have a happy holiday rather than worrying about it in the background. You will cope regardless because thousands of women cope with a diagnosis of cancer every day. Im coping. If u need to you will too but I sincerely hope u don't. Listen to your hubbie - sometimes they're right!",
