I originally had SAVI brachytherapy radiation to the left breast following a lumpectomy in December 2011. In July 2016, I was diagnosed with regionally metastatic breast cancer in 5 subpectoral/axillary/hilar lymph nodes. Finished Adriamycin/Cytoxan (4 rounds) chemotherapy on November 2, 2016. Since I've not had external beam radiation before, I am looking forward to reading posts, and gathering information about the process. Best of luck to you!",
