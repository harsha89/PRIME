I found some pictures showing the front and back of different forms on the Amoena USA website.  Go to their website and choose \"Breast Forms\", then \"Essentials\" and scroll to the bottom of the page.  Hoover your mouse over each picture for details.  Erica also has breast form info on her breastfree.org site: http://breastfree.org/viewer.php?num=42 Finally, be aware that some local American Cancer Society offices have breast form and mastectomy bra programs.  One local ACS gives a form (or two for bilateral) and a bra free to local survivors every two years regardless of income or insurance--a very generous program thanks to local fundraising.  Do check with your medical staff as they may know of other programs in your local area for free or reduced fee forms and bras.",

My personal experience:  I had surgery about a year prior to yours (A total of 4 lymph nodes removed).  And, I had chest wall and underarm swelling that would dissipate an hour or two after removing my lingerie.  At the time, I wondered if it was lymphedema and was evaluated medically.  With time, the swelling has been less and less.  I cannot remember the last time I had swelling after wearing forms all day.  I would recommend being checked for lymphedema because there are several good therapies to help it from progressing further.  Binney on the Lymphedema board is very knowledgeable if you have lymphedema-related questions.",

You've given me some great recommendations.  But, I'd still like to know...how much time passes before edema is considered LE?",
