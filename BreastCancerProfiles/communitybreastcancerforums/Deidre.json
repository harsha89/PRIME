I keep trying to picture what they will say, how they will say it, how I will react and if it is cancer how will I tell my family. these thoughts are all looping over and over in my mind. How foolish I will feel if it is not cancer and I have cried to all of you for the past week. Your time is important, I appreciate you sharing it with me. I had a friend stay with me the night I came home from my lumpectomy. I wish she was here now. xo xo",

She said that they will just take the lump and when I find out the results if it is cancer then they will go back in and take more tissue. Mine is on the edge of my aerola. At the top ( 12 oclock ) nothing showed on the mammo, my pcp sent me for the ultrasound since he did not like the feel of it. I know that white is bad on an ultrasound but there appears to be some fluid could it still be cancer with fluid?",

I am so happy that it is over! My surgeon said that I should know the results by the end of the week. I feel much more positive after reading all that you guys have been through. I feel like a baby complaining when I dont even know for sure what the outcome will be. Again I thank you all, I will let you know what I find out. xoxox",
