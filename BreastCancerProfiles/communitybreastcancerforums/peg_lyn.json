Calico: Is it normal to have itchiness after bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction? It's been 2.5 yrs and it drives me crazy. It seems to be \u201cinside,\u201d no signs of abnormality outside, no redness etc...and it is on the good side too. Thank you.Answers - Kristin Brill, M.D., F.A.C.S. That itchiness is not uncommon. It may be nerve pain or sensation. You get the sensation of itchiness, almost like a phantom pain. It may be more nerve-related than anything truly real or skin related. It tends to disappear over time.",
