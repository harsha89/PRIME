My margins were very clear.  If they were to find anything else.. they had my permission to remove both. Note: another friend of mine had the 1 breast removed and has gone through reconstruction.  She says when she wears a swimsuit.. no one can even tell.  However, she feels the difference.. she said.. it isn't bad.. just different.",

I SURVIVED the surgery.. now it is on to the radiation and tamoxifen.  I \"had\" large breasts and was told I could do a bi-lateral reduction(lumpectomy) to get a nice even reconstruction and then do the radiation.  This is the treatment plan I chose.  I am 44 years old and was dx with DCIS STAGE 0 GRADE 3.  2.5 mm in size. They got very large and clear margins.  I did not find much out about the oncoplasty type of surgery on the net.  Basically, they do a reconstruction before radiation because large breasts do not take well to radiation.  I am very happy with the results.  I was all prepared to have masectomy.  I decided at my age that shoot I might as well have some size C perkys!  Do I worry if the cancer will come back?  No, I will not waste one precious moment of my life worrying.  I have found across the board.. the most positive of people heal faster.  We have awesome medical technology!  This is not the treatments of the past.  Find out what works for you and if you do not like your doctors... find another one. DCIS is cancer. PERIOD. Do not feel like it is less because it was caught early.  I like what Honey 831 says.. DON'T GIVE UP.. STAND UP!!  ",

I only had 2mm size tumor (very tiny) and since they took about a pound out of each side that pretty much gave me clear margins.  I have totally had a week of ups and downs.   Went to see the radiologist totally prepared for radiation and we talked it over and felt like with such clear margins that I would not need radiation.  His own wife had bc and has been a survivor for 10 years.  He said it would only make about 3-5% points difference in whether or not it returned. He also informed me I would not be able to have radiation again and if it did come back that masectomy would be my only option.  Told me that reconstruction is harder to do after radiation?   We decided to leave the radiation in my aresenal of treatment options. I will pull out the big gun if it is needed should a larger and more invasive tumor return. Call me optimistic... So I am going to start my tamoxifen... Need to find out more info on that. I guess not having radiation was my up side for the week. Downside... I am possibly joining a clinical study.  Since I fit the criteria for DCIS, clear margins, etc... they tested my tumor for Her2 Neu.  Evidently, it is POSITIVE!!  I guess this means that my cells can be aggressive and they think that if they find DCIS and Her2+ that they can prevent DCIS returning with the use of Herceptin??????  I am trying to read up on it. There is controversy on the subject.  It is quite interesting.  Will talk more with the med onc doctor on Friday before I decide for sure to join the study.  I need to know more about being Her2+!!! Also, on the underside of the GOOD non BC breast I have a spot that is not healing well and I am freaked about infection.  GOD BLESS all of you that have gone through chemo, mastec, hysterectomies, radiation... you truly are the survivors....:)",
