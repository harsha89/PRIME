She is the rock of our family !  I am just nauseous typing this note.  I would love to continue to talk to people who might be supportive and that understand.  I am not prepared for this.  She is 58 and too young to have to face this.  And she is a wonderful person.  I am rambling - but I am scared for her and for all of us.  If anyone can offer some encouragement, I would very much appreciate it.   Duckie -  keep me posted and I will keep my best thoughts for your Mom and your family.  ",

I am also very scared and nervous as we wait for results.  However, she was told by the radiologist that it is likely cancer. I can only hope and pray that they are wrong.  ",
