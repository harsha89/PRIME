I start my chemo A/c treatment this Thursday and it finally hit me that this is real and is happening to ME and no I am not going to wake up from a bad dream. I am so scared behind belief so i can use any help/advice i can get from you all. I know together we will get through this, maybe it doesnt seem too doable at this time but i know the more we know the more prepared we are to fight this beast.  Waiting to hear from you ....
