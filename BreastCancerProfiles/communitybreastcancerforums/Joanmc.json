My mom was one of 9 children and at 49 back in 1983, mom was diagnosed with breast cancer & passed away at 52 back in 86' due to re-mis-diagnosis.  Her sister developed breast cancer at age 60 just 10 years ago & passed away recently from reoccurrence.   The genetic couselor did not feel I had a strong case of having BRCA but went ahead & tested me.  Mom was 1 of 9.  They are the only 2 with breast cancer & she had one brother die of lung cancer but he was a heavy smoker.  I have 100's of cousins all without breast cancer or  any cancer for that matter.   I tested positive & she said she could have fallen off the chair.    Since then, my sister tested positive & she is 9 years older than me (55) and has never had cancer.  My cousins (3) all carry the BRCA2 also.  So far, no breast or ovarian cancer.  having the gene does not mean a person will develop cancer.  That is the good news.  Glad you were tested!  Welcome to BRCA sisterhood!
