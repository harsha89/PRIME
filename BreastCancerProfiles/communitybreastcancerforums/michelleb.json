I found this site purely by accident after googling my symptoms (not a good idea) and i'm wondering if i'm being silly. About 3 weeks ago I noticed a feeling of tenderness in my right breast when my 5 yr old son lay on me. I thought at the time 'oh my bra must be too tight' so I haven't worn one since (I have small breasts anyway) The tenderness didn't go away so I decided to have a feel to see what was going on. I wouldn't describe what I have as a lump, its not a particular shape or anything, just that the right side of my breast is 'hard' compared to the other and painful to touch. I have an appointment with my doctor tomorrow, but I feel like a fraud. Am I wasting their time as its not a lump? Also, I had a full blood count done a few weeks ago as doc was looking for possible glandular fever due to having constant virus symptoms and fatigue. Surely this FBC would show up something if it was sinister?? I have no idea what my family history is as I was adopted. Feeling a mixture of emotions from terror to embarrassment because there's probably nothing wrong with me... help? Log in to post a reply",

He said it feels smooth which indicates its probably a cyst. He has referred me to the breast care centre for an ultrasound which I should get in less than 2 weeks. Thats going to be a long 2 weeks!! I will keep reading here in the meantime x",

I'm not sure what to think, the pain and tenderness I had a month ago has completely gone now but the lump/hardness is still there. Something strange though, its now VERY obvious to both me and DH that my rt breast is quite a bit larger than the lt (they were always very symmetrical), and the nipple seems to have 'grown' downwards... did anyone else have this? I almost canceled because the pain has gone but DH is adamant I am still going! Would be interested to know if anyone else had the 'growing breast' issue. TIA  Michelle x",

I know I should shut my mind off and sleep for few hours but its hard. i can't stop touching it, thinking maybe it will go away! I'm also working a night shift tomorrow night, 12 hours, 7pm to 7am. Not sure which i'm more worried about, work or the doctor!! I just want to say I have the upmost respect for all you ladies out there who dedicate your time to this forum. I have read many posts today which have brought me to tears. You are angels xxx",

I'm kind of hoping the pain is a good sign, which is a strange thing to say.  The doctor did mention that they may not do a mammo, because I am only 29 and the images would be pretty useless. I will definitely insist on biopsy after reading all your advice. Thank you everyone!",

Saw the nurse who asked me a few questions, then the doctor came in who was complaining about having to come into work at 08:30. He examined my breasts lying down and said he can't feel anything!?!?! but go round for a US anyway.. The examination hurt, a lot and even my DH said he could see the 'thing' lump or whatever it is as I was lay down. Went for US, radiologist said she see's a 'ridge'??? but not to worry. Back in to see the doc, he says I am perfectly normal and must have rib or muscular pain, here's some painkillers, off you go.. What the?? I don't get it and i'm so confused. Help",
