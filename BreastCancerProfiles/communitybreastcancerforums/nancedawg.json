My underarms both feel like there is a big ball under there esp the right where the lymph nodes were.  My chest is still numb and my right shoulder blade.  I am assuming this is all normal.  Day by Day.",

There is always something new to think about.  Oh yea, path report...17 nodes removed (right) 6 cancerous.  Tumor 2.1 cm.    My plan now is to fight any possible mets with diet and alternative treatment.  We'll see how that goes.",
