I've been sleeping half the night in bed and the other half in lazy boy in living room. Works like a charm, alternating back pressure. Sorry for the rambling. It's not easy composing a thoughtful message on the iPad. 'Specially with the dang auto correct. Soooo very glad to have found you guys. Hope to contribute more!",

I have finished my four A/C and today had my second of four (every three weeks) taxol.  I haven't slept well since I started the taxol. Anyone else have this problem? I'm literally trying to drug myself to sleep, Lunesta + Xanex and still I toss and turn. I'm also starting to get strange hot flashes, cold on the back of my neck and hot and sweaty on top of my head!  I wonder why i'm getting the taxol like I am when so many other triple negatives are getting the 12 x. I also have been sporting a completly bald head. I have only noticed one or two people blatently smiling at me. I'm my bouncy self and smile at all who meet my eye and they always smile back. I've actually come across some really kind people who have reached out to me because of my bald head.  Anyway, thought I'd introduce myself. I'm 43, from Overland Park, KS and happily married.",
