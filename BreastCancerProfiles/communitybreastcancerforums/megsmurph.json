She started 4 rounds of adriamycin and cytoxin in late November. Had initially good results - tumor shrank but started to grow again by the third treatment. Onc said not to worry - stay the course. In Feb 2014 she started herceptin and taxol weekly. Things continued to grow during that treatment. For 8 weeks my mom complained to the onc that they were growing - she literally said \"i'm not worried\". Finally we convinced her to order a PET scan. Did that on April 14. Tumors have grown and she has mets to two sites in bones and has plueral effusions in lungs. Got a second opinion from a respected Brest Cancer onc in San Diego who said this was the worst case secenario. She started palliative radaition right away (did that for three weeks). Did a breast biopsy - the tumors had changed - now triple negative. The Onc says there is nothing more to offer. We are on hospice and my mom is declining fast. I am writing to see if anyone has any suggestions that I might bring to the onc? Many blessings to all of you and your families as you navigate this journey.Â  Meghan",
