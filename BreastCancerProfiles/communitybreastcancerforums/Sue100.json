I was advised my someone on this site to get a second opinion from a world famous expert and pathologist who has a consulting practice. It was the best thing I ever did! This man has spoken all over the world on DCIS. He will order your films and slides from your hospital and surgeon, and then re-write your pathology. He will tell you exactly where you stand as far as whether or not you actually need radiation. You will get a written report plus an hour long phone consultation where you can ask him all your questions which pertain to YOUR case. Everyone is different, and there is a big group of women that are being needlessly radiated. (There is a new article on WebMD about this issue.) He, along with another famous doctor in CA, participated in inventing the Van Nuys Prognostic Index. It looks at all the characteristics of YOUR DCIS and gives you a ratng, which he will explain in detail. Without knowing where you stand and what YOUR risk is, how can you make an informed decision? Even weeks after the consult was over and I was having some issues with my choice, he immediately answered my questions and came to the rescue! I didn't think my insurance would cover it, but I was reimbursed for the majority of the cost! I don't think I'm supposed to mention a doctor's name on here, but if anyone wants more info, email me at lauren@mancini.ws. I would be glad to help.  I also asked him about Tamoxifen since I was reading so many conflicting things. He told me there are two new reports out showing Tamoxifen has a .077% benefit for DCIS patients. I asked, then why is my surgeon pushing it so hard? His reply was...tradition. I have since found out that I am estrogen dominant, so in my case, I am taking bio-identical progesterone to balance out the little bit of estrogen I have, rather than shut it down. (Unopposed estrogen is dangerous because it makes cells multiply...cancer.) Also...check your vitamin D levels. I was totally lacking! Good luck and God bless!",

I had to pick up my report and films from the Imaging Center to bring with me to my biopsy. I read the report and there was a BIO RADS rating. I was a 4-B, which was an 89% probability for malignancy. I was a wreck after reading that. I had never heard of DCIS, which isn't even malignant. I wish I had been given more information. I have come to find out that the doctors don't tell you anything and it has been a huge learning experience for me, which I had to take into my own hands. Good luck!",
