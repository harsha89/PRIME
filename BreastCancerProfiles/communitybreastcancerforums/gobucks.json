I know everyone's body and journey is different, but if I could help just one woman get through rads as easy as I did, and look as good as I do right now, then I've done something wonderful. I just finished 33 treatments that included 8 boosts and I did have bolus. This is my 2nd time battling this shit and I'm young so we have been aggressive with surgery and treatment. I am done rads , i finished on July 6, friday, and I look fantastic. Seriously, the only place that I am red is where I got my boosts and that can be expected cause it's in my arm pit, it's rubbed a lot, and ive had lots of surgeries there. Now my advice to you all is skin care. I am fair complected. We allllll. Thought it would be rough. This is what I used. Ivory soap with aloe in it (you find it at Walmart), and I used True Blu 100% Shea butter from Bath and Body works that comes in a small round tub. Only buy the body balm version. I applied it about 3 times a day with a heavy application at night. I would've never heard of this if it wasn't for my mom. I livein a part of Maryland where I have access to all types of meds and cream. My mom doesn't but wanted to help and wanted to buy me something smelly and nice. She went to bath and body works, told them what was going on, and the lady there swore by it. Where my mom lives they don't have a lot of money to spend on the prescription creams so they started coming in there. Lots of women are having incredible results. So you can try. Its not complete magic. I still had pain at times and of course I got very tired.",
