I was 44 at dx 1cm stage 1 grade 2. My onc type was 17. I wanted chemo for peace of mind. It is my body and I have to live with what I deceide. I needed to know that I did everything possible to attack this disease. I had a rt. mx and did 4 rounds of CT. The chemo was doable and I only missed 2 days of work all during my treatments. My doctor listen to me and we made a plan. It is YOUR choice. Find a good doctor that will listen to you THINK POSITIVE Catherine",
