The Minoxidil SOLUTION 2% v/v is straight Minoxidil as the active ingredient which is for Women only. The inactive ingrediants are alcohol (60% v/v) propylene glycol & purified water.  These are the same for any Minoxidil SOLUTION no  mater the brand as long as its 2%. (always make sure)  Rogaine Foam: Active Ingredient: Minoxidil 5% w/w (without propellant) Inactive Ingredients: butane, butylated hydroxytoluene, cetyl alcohol, citric acid, glycerin, isobutane, lactic acid, polysorbate 60, propane, purified water, SD alcohol 40-B, stearyl alcohol Difference is volume vs mass. Above information is for Minoxidil only not the shampoo's or conditioner.  I hope I'm making sense, lol Ok now as far as Shampoo and Conditioner it seems Rogaine does not  have any for women I can not find any info.  So in order for our hair to grow healthy fast Minoxidil is what we need. As a stylist I always promote professional shampoo/conditioner because the ingredients are totally different!  Have you ever felt like you needed to change your shampoo after a while of using.  That's the difference between store bought and salon  bought.  The store bought  ingredients are generic and high on  paraffin wax (paraffin wax is what makes our hair shine but in high volume it turns into build up just like any wax does) I really hope this helps, cause I know as women we want to feel and look good! With all this my number 1 advice is no matter what you use protect your scalp from the sun please!!!  ",

My hair started to feel pricklies about 4-6 weeks after. I recently had my first shape up and edge to clean it up a bit. I'm a hairdresser so was very desperate to get my hair back (I hate saying this out loud, I am grateful I have my life :0) I also use Cera-Fil shampoo and Conditioner, its a professional product to help stimulate the follicle to produce faster hair growth. Also make sure you are protecting scalp from sun. Stay hydrated, I can't stress it enough!!!!!! ",

Sorry I can't say more to encourage you but I wanted to reach out!  Good luck and stay strong",

Please do not buy anywhere unless its a professional salon. Theres a green bottle and a blue bottle, I use the blue labeled bottled called Retaliate. I also use the 2% Minoxidil which is specially for women.  ",
