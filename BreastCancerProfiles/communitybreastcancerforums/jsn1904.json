So..my dad was diagnosed with cancer last year. Stomach. In between stage 2 and 3. To say that this traumatized me would be an understatement. Ever since, I dream about cancer every night. Every week I assume that I have some form of it. This went on for months..since August last year. And then..my worst nightmare happened. I found a lump in the upper left size of my left breast. I cried for 3 days, went to the doctor who did a fine needle aspiration (yesterday) and now I wait...everything on the internet tells me that I have cancer, My mind and gut feeling says the same. My left boob always gets sore and has more hard lumpy bits whereas my right boob is perfectly fine. My left boob has also always had a lightly inverted nipple. This has been that way my whole life basically. When the doctor did the aspiration I felt pain from the injection site all the way to my nipple and is was really really sore. SO here I am..not worried about myself. More worried about how to tell my family I have breast cancer after just turning 25 and with my dad going through all that he's going through with stomach cancer...I cannot stop crying.

It helps when someone actually tells you factually that it might not be breast cancer and that person has a legitimate alternative. I just assumed that if it was a fibroedenoma, the doctor wouldn't have immediately got concerned and done the fine needle aspiration. This lump is very deeply rooted and hard. Although it does have a smooth, oval surface. It is in quite the awkward location and deep so hard to say if it moves much. It's nearly under my armpit but not quite. On the edge of my breas",

I am so happy I found this site because since my dad's diagnosis I have had issues with my mental stability (anxiety, depression, etc.) I feel like if I had been a part of this group at that stage, it would have changed my quality of life in these last few months. I feel like I have another hard lump with irregular edges next to my nipple. It doesn't move. Feels like an arrow and that's where I felt pain during the biopsy. I had something similar before that simply went away. What could it be? My lump was painless. Doesn't painless and deeply rootedmean cancer?",
