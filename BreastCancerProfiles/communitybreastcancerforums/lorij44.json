I had to get compression hose,and my insurance covered a walker that I had to use for about a month. I was put on a diuretic but it dropped my blood pressure so low I ended up in the emergency room. Anyway, I lost 12 lbs fairly quickly, but have been struggling since January 2011 with the other 13.  I've always been fairly small framed so I shouldn't complain but it really makes me angry sometimes that I have to work at losing the last of the weight.",
