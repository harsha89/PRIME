    "Content": "Mar 31, 2018 08:39PM - edited Mar 31, 2018 08:40PM by Famgal I feel I am late to the group but I had my first radiation treatment March 29 - glad to be started. This thread has been very informative to me :) I will be having 33 treatments over the course of the next 6 1/2 weeks. I may get sick of the drive but thankful it's only 1 hour from my home. They are radiating me in my armpit - internal mam lymph nodes and clavical... also my chest wall. This is my 2nd time with breast cancer - the 1st I caught it early and didn't need chemo or radiation so the last 7 months has been all new to me.",
