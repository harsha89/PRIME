I didn't push for it, even though as a nurse I felt I should. A year and a half later the cancer was back, in the same spot and an additional spot. Because I had already had a lumpectomy and radiation, I had to have a mastectomy. I went ahead and did both. Please go for the most aggressive treatment your doctor recommends. As for hair loss, I have alopecia universalis, so I didn't have hair anyway. I get compliments daily on how gorgeous my hair is, and it's a 14. wig from China! It's all in the attitude!!",
