I have went through the surgeries and now am receiving chemo. Does anyone out there have problems with metalic taste in your mouth constanley, dry heels.... what can you do? Does this get any better? I have only one more chemo treament of Adridmycin and Cytoxan. So far it has kept me nauseaded and fatigued. Even water taste terrible. I have faith I will make it through this round. Then I will receive four treaments once every three weeks of Taxotere and Herceptin. With this also comes six weeks of radiation. Can anyone offer any suggestions that can help with the side effects of these treatments? To all have a blessed day.
