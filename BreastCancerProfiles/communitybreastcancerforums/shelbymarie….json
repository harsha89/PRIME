Liver MRI and hopefully biopsy next week. Waiting on schedule but will know for sure by noon on Monday as gemzar/carbo chemo scheduled at 3:00. Biopsy is making me nervous. Can you tell me what to expect? A couple names I recognize Artist Of Lake Tahoe and Naturegirl from the Faslodex/Ibrance thread. I'm sorry to see you on this thread too. You're advice in the past has been so helpful. Thanks, shelby",

For example, after Xeloda failed he mentioned Taxotere but it was summer and I didn't want to lose my toenails when its flip flop season. So I suggested Abraxane. He laughed and said that was a great compromise! Abraxane lasted almost a year and so easy so I'm glad we could agree!",

One definitly but 3 more than likely just not exactly sure. I have the CYberknife surgery tomorrow. My mother lives in Missouri, way north, closer to Iowa state line. and The first time I called her she said she wanted to come out. when I had my meeting with my neurosurgeon and knew more, I called her again and ask if she still wanted to come out she said yes. So, I picked her up at the airport sunday evening. 24 hrs later we were having a big fight about....(and this is what I was told) how I'm selfish, self rightous, a snob, condescending and how I don't include her in anything (mind you she lives 2000 miles away) and how we've (meaning my sister who lives in Reno and her) have wanted to tell me this for 3 years. An arguement the started because I was in the ER all day on Friday due to excrutiating pain in my soulder and abdomen (i have mets to my bones, liver and now brain). My sister got upset because she wasn't called first. My friend came to take me to the ER. actually, before i could call my sister, my friend called and she was on her lunch and could take me. my friend is in a position where she can change her schedule whenever and however she wants, my sister is not in a postion like that. However I do call my sister first when something is wrong etc. I just don't like taking her away from work (my sister has recently lost a 10 yr position and in her walking papers ' having an ill family member causing ms. adams to leave frequently' was one of the bullet points. my sister never signed up for FMLA and therefore i was blamed for her losing that job.) So now 3 yrs later i still don't like taking my sister away from her job and call on friends to help when I need help. My sister is dependable when its conveniant for her. So, sitting at my house, my mom is here to help me with cybeknife and a change in chemo. my sister gets mad because she wasn't called first and I ask her how sick do i have to be for her change her plans. I was referring to she was having a dinner party at her house on Friday night and therefore she had to leave the ER at 5:00. expecting my friend who left work (who also has a family of her own) to stay and give me a ride home at who knows when. my sister wants to be called first, be the first to know but not be the first to make adjustements to her schedule. It's an inconvenience for her. I apologized my cancer is such an inconvenience i said. she told me to \"F off\" and walked out, screaming \"its not all about you!\" on her way out the door. I sat there with my mouth agape having really know idea what just happened and My mother simply states \"she's tired of you making her feel guilty. and I'm tired of it too.\" my mother actually said this, I make them feel guilty. i'm stunned. I'm having cyberknife surgery in 2 days, starting a new chemo cuz I have progression everywhere and now they tell me 'you make us feel guilty' and they've been wanting to say this for 3 years. BAM!! right before I'm having surgery, a minor one at that i understand but I am still scared to death One I hoped my mother could be there to help me and comfort me. I'm doing this all alone, multiple chemos and scans every other month, alone. Apperantly I make them feel guilty because I don't call them first or include them in everything (in my defense that is utter rubbish). I defend myself explaining that i don't want to be a burden so I ask lots of people for help at different times. and my mother lives 2000 miles away so quite frankly what is she gonna do. My mom and i proceed to get into an arguement where I am defending myself most of the time but a few very hurtful statements came through.. \"you don't know grieving! you never wanted a child in the first place so you don't have the right to grieve!\" (i wanted to wait till I had the right man in my life to bring a child into this world not because i didn't want one.) i watched my mother mock my pain. she cradled her shoulder, cupped her abdomen, put her hands over her back and said \"poor shelby and her pain\" . (if anyone who knows me knows that when I go to the ER its a big deal, especially for pain. She kept saying I'll never change but when I asked what I needed to change she couldn't give me an example. She repeatedly said I was mean and cold and again asked for an example and she couldn't. I would say Please tell me what i did wrong and she would respond with \"you know what you did.\" This type of attacking went on back and forth for 45 min. and After her last display I told her to get out. She was staying in my spare bedroom and I refused to be talked to this way by anyone. I said I can't do anything right in hers or my sisters eyes and if they feel guilty about something they did or did not do, it's on them not me. It is not my responsibility to make sure people are comfortable with my cancer. I am absoluetly beside myself. I'm very hurt and can't stop crying. I have cyberknofe tomorrow at 10:00 and am just asking am I wrong? What could I have done diferent? where did this come from? I'm sorry this is so long. I just don't know what to do. I have been to therapy for the last 2 years talking about how to deal with my mom and sister and what I've learned is it's not my responsibilty to make sure people are comfortable with my cancer. any advice or comfort you can give is appreciated. shelby",

And on that note, I made the very difficult decision to eliminate my sister from my life. Last night was another big fight over the Halloween bins.... how stupid right? The shared Halloween bins we have both been contributing costumes to for years and have been stored away in my shed. She wanted to bring them back, I asked her to just keep them since she was probably gonna get'em within a few years anyway, she should just keep them. She said no and demanded she bring them and leave them putside for me (all whilst calling me a bitch and selfish and all kinds of bad names). Unreal. I'm in incredible pain with 2 new compression fractures in L2 and L3 and she has plans on leaving them outside for me to lift and put in my shed. I lost it. I told her I never wanted to talk with her again and have deleted her from FB and blocked her numbers from my phone. Only to learn this morning that she has decided to air our disagreement on FB, playing the poor me act... my sister doesn't want me in her life etc. It's disgusting, classless and pathetic. I'm so upset about having to make decision but I stand with conviction about it. I will no longer allow myself to be her verbal punching bag and continue to be treated this way by her. I'm also waiting to get in with my therapist. I can confidently say that my mother agrees with me my sister airing this on FB is disgusting. Soooo, i guess that is good maybe? I thnk it's the first time my mother has ever agreed with me on something. I had an oncology appointment yesterday and had to have the 'talk\" with him. It was a loose talk in that if this disease continues going downhill the way it has this year, I'm looking at only a couple years left. Not for lack of treatment options but because my body simply can't do it anymore. I've been on chemo for nearly 3 years straight. My cell counts yesterday were so low you'd think I'd continued on chemo not had a 6 week break. I'm in excrutiaing pain and waiting on my pain pills until radiation starting next week. Then in the beginning of December I'm starting Halaven. Has anyone been on this? What were your experiences? Anyway, thank you again for all of your advice and support. I've made a decisin and while it tough it's the right one.  xo, shelbs",

For the past 2 yrs ( done every 3 months with scans) including my stage IV dx where my TM's were 12 and lower. Completely worthless. That's why my MO says \"you're a scanner...\" In MArch they jumped to low to mid 40's. I understande those are little numbers in the big picture,but for me it was huge jump. It's also when Ibrance failed quite spectacularly. I had major bone progression and unknown liver mets. MO says more cancer to cause markers to register. MO is also now doing some kind of blood tumor DNA something to see what may work. I've had the Foundation 1 tumor DNA sequencing done on my rib. 27 mutations but only 1 that had a recommendation for chemo- Ibrance. Ha! I am very lucky to have this blood guy. I just love him and he listens and gets upset when I'm upset with radiology and when i want to do something we don't argue. One time I had to seriously move some chemo days around not following the day 1,day 8, day 15 treatment plan. I ws going on vaca, which he knew about but the pharmacist at my treatment center didn't. She called my MO to almost tattle and also complained it made things harder on them messing up the notes and cycle #'s blah, blah, blah. My MO very firmly said \"Shelby's treatment is for her quality of life, not cure, and if dressing up like Harry Potter in Florida extends her life even 1 day then our job is to help her do that! Get over it! \" So Thank you I am very proud I picked a good one be on my team. That's what I said when I went to my first appt. I told him I was designing Shelby's Team and explained how I communicate, the type of patient/dr relationship that I felt I responded best too and hoped they could work with a patient who believes she is the boss of her healthcare and decisions made . I said 50% of my fight is having this kind of relationship with my doctor. I told this to all of my doctors.... rad onc, cardio-thoracic surgeon, plastics and general surgeon, primary care, my dentist and ophthalmologist, gyno and, physical therapist. Lucky for me they all agree. Our 5 yr cancer dx date is coming up and all of my doctors are still the same. I've only had a second opinion once at MO's urging and the office even set it up. 😊 Good luck with the new MO!",

I hAve spent the last 30 minutes rereading all of your Advice and just learned that GatorGal has moved to better and less painful pastures. Omg, she just gave me heartfelt advice... 😢 Thank you all for listening and helping me. It has been a tough week. I had Cyberknife last Wednesday which went very well. Only one lesion, very small at 4 mm. The struggle has been with my sister and mother. Even though we had a family counseling session, there is still hurt. I feel it's particularly on my part but also see it in the faces of my family. I'm still very mad at them and find I'm taking every opportunity to make them feel worse then they already do. This behavior is not me. They have not apologized and justified their actions with not knowing how to handle my cancer. I simply stated THEY don't have to handle my cancer, I do. They have to support me which they are not doing with their painful outbursts. I also pointed out the comment about wanting to tell me how they feel for 3 yrs. The family counselor wasn't letting that one go when they got quiet. She prodded and reminded them they agreed to this session.... So, basically we got nowhere except they got a scolding and a firm but gentle reminder that our relationship (the 3 of us) has forever been damaged and don't be surprised if I retreat. The counselor explained that is human nature when trust has been compromised and pain caused. My mom tried to argue with the counselor saying how can she guide me to not depend on my family and the answer was \" you did that on your own.\" My mom has been staying with my sister until Sunday night when she came back to my house. I've just been sleeping a lot. Like 16-18 hrs at a time a lot. My mother commented that she felt like was walking on eggshells at my house. I told her to go back to shauna's then. I also reminded her that the last time she was here and at my sister's she felt used (exact words she said to me during the big fight) because all she did was laundry and cleaned etc. I asked her what she wanted, what did she think wAs gonna happen when I explained to her 3 times I was having surgery and not sure what to expect afterwards? I can't wait till she goes back to Missouri. And as it was mentioned, trying to keep our families at arms length is very difficult because I do wonder if they love me. So, I thought I was supposed to start Halaven but my MO has changed his mind and waiting for something cuz he also changed my appt. Until after Nov 1st. My last doc appt we also talked about Navelbine and Ixempra. Any advice for all 3? Which one would you choose if given a choice? I still have liver mets, 3 medium sized tumors buts lots of little ones, multifocal. I equate it to a paint brush splatter. And bones mets everywhere, extensive through pelvis, spine and scapula and now ribs #4-6 on right side. Lots of pain with those, continue to increase pain meds. Oh, and I took to heart what was suggested about a proxy. My sister being that she is in town wAs my decision maker, life insurance getter every thing. I have asked my very best friend( the one who took my to ER and stayed the night with me cuz she loves me and God forbid my sister's bbq of 10 people be cancelled or delayed).... ( see, I'm still very angry) . We are me with her cousin who is a lawyer to get things done. So, thank you again for thoughtful insight. I've been so caught up with my BS how is everyone doing? I'm very sad to hear of GatorGal and after almost writing for 45 min. I'm still crying.... You all have been so wonderful, thank you so much for they've and support 💕 Xo, shelbs",
