However if it caused them to find something bad then it's a good thing it happened the way it did! I'm going with his recommendations. My concern is that something is hiding in dense tissue. And better now than later if it is something malignant. Thank you for your information.  On a flip note my husband insists that because the biopsy was benign that this test will also show nothing. I\u2019m not as convinced.",
