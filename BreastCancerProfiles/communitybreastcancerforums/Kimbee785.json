    "Content": "Nov 12, 2013 02:56PM - edited Nov 12, 2013 02:56PM by Kimbee785 I am 57 years old, diabetic type 2 and had a masectomy of my right breast and 15 lymph nodes removed, 12 of them were cancerous.(October 16 2013) I was prescribed pain medicine but have such a fear of drugs that I can't bring myself to take them considering what I will be going through when the chemo starts. It is so hard to get comfortable, the pain is awful even on my back just below my shoulder blade. my armpit feels like it's on fire and the tightness is awful. I have been trying really hard to keep my right arm mobile but it doesn't stop the pain. Is there anything I should be doing that might help? I have gotten no instructions from the surgeon other than reach over my head to touch my left ear. I thought I saw someone mention massage.. does that help? What kind of lotion should I use? what kind of excercises? I am on disability and have only Medicare so I do not have money for special therapies. I am not even sure how I am going to pay for the chemo and radiation yet. I live alone so there is noone living with me to help me out. My nieghbors are kind, but they are men and although they help me a lot with chores and such, I can not ask them to help me with this. Thank you and God bless for any words of encouragement you may have to offer.",
