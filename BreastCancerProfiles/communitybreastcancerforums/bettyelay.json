My oncologist wanted a PET scan to check METS before we start Chemo and the hospital has refused to do it.  I have talked to EVERYONE in the Medicaid program at the county and state level.  There are programs, but you have to had jumped thru their hoops before your diagnosis.  Craziest thing I've ever seen.  Anybody else can offer any suggestions.  They say they will still give me my chemo.  But what about my surgery, then more chemo, and radiation????  I am sooooo frustrated.
