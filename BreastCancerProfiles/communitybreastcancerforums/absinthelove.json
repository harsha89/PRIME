    "Content": "absinthelove wrote: So, basically a found a lump in my right breast and I went to get it checked out. I was then sent to the hospital where the doctor there found another lump in my left breast. This really scared me because I had no idea how long it has been there, and had no clue what any of the lumps could be. After a long, worrying wait, I finally had a biopsy on both breasts. I am now waiting on the results, and I am very scared becuase I have been waiting for a while. I have an appointment this Friday to see the breast surgion in the hospital. Another reason I am anxious is because a few days ago I have noticed a new mole on my left breast, I have never had a mole on any of my breasts and I read that this could be a sign of cancer, and now I can't stop thinking about it. I'm an 18 year old girl who is very, very worried. Log in to post a reply",
