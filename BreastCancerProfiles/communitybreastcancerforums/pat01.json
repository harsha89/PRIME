On top of this there is a light rash.  It is itchy, not maddeningly so, just annoying.  Called RO office, they said to use OTC hydrocortisone cream, and call them for a Monday appt if it doesn't get better.  RO is 45 minutes away, but I have a GYN appt. Monday morning locally, so figured I would just have him look at it. Someone suggested radiation dermatitis, someone else a fungal infection.  It looks horrible, but is not peeling, and is only under the breast.  I'm wondering if I should stop using creams and start letting it dry out? Thanks,  Pat",

I've been using Eucerin cream.  What makes it feel best is to just support my breast away from my body, so that the skin is not touching, and it airs everything out under there.  But obviously I can only do that when I am sitting around at home (I work full time). RO said to expect some skin reaction up to a week after rads, but this seems to be getting worse and not better. Any suggestions for OTC or home remedies?  I'm wondering if I should discontinue using the Eucerin under the breast, as it just seems to make it ultramoist under there, when airing the area out makes it feel best.  Should I place some cotton between the breast and chest during the day at work so the skin doesn't touch?  I've been wearing cotton sports bras, so my breasts are mashed down on the chest. thanks - Pat Dx 6/1/2011, DCIS/IDC, Right, Stage IA, 0/2 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Hormonal Therapy Arimidex (anastrozole) Radiation Therapy Log in to post a reply",

I used the OTC hydrocortisone cream, but it wasn't getting better, so I called again and discussed with nurse, we decided it might be fungal, so all weekend I used OTC antifungal. Still had red area this morning, with some skin peeling, so they had me come in. RO says it is a burn, and gave me prescription for silvadene cream. I'm to bathe the area 2x a day with warm salt water, pat dry, then apply cream and cover with gauze. He said that one of the side effects of the Canadian protocol (which I had) is that the burn can develop up to a week after stopping rads.I found out today the rash I have (still have it) is actually called folliculitis. I'm going braless at home, but wearing cotton sports bras at work - not sure if I can carry off the braless look at work LOL, especially being so lopsided now, but I may give it a try tomorrow, as it feels so much better when not confined to the bra.",
