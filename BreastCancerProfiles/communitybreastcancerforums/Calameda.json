At 6-month follow up, it had doubled in size and now is deemed agressive.  Just wondering if anyone knows of medical malpractice attorney (I'm in northern California) who might talk to me about this.  Not looking for financial windfall, just enough to afford costs of treatment and likely loss of income (which will lead to loss of my home I'm afraid).",
