There are people you know who are not pinups and who look great! Blessed Mother Teresa always looked fantastic! She was always smiling! You must forgive me Rose. I confess absolutely that I am here dishing out advice that I am not good at taking myself. You wrote \"Well as nice as a boobless, left arm bigger then the right (lymph edema), middle aged woman with thinning hair can look. Good thing I love being alive more then I care what I look like\" - that is word for word exactly what I feel like! I know i am stage 3 NOT dealing with the worse hand you have been dealt. ENJOY YOUR SHIRTS Rose. You did NOT buy them to be buried in. I am so happy to hear you bought them to LIVE in. When I was dx-d stage 3 there was a Mum in my daughters school who had been stage 3, two years before me. Her youngest daughter and my daughter started in pre-infants class together two years after her dx and that was when I first met her. She probably saved my life as she was the person I mentioned my own symptoms to who absolutely kicked me out the door to get a doctors appt. She was one of a couple of real life angels who flocked to my side when I was dx-d. Two and a half years ago she got dx-d with a recurrence. It was bad. Her 4 daughters are all still at school, her youngest is now 10 same as me. She fought and she died last Tue June 14. She was 44. I went to see her body in repose. This is not something I would usually do (our funerals have a closed coffin in church) but I felt really strongly that in some way I owed it to her. That seeing her remains must be done. It was an emotional kick in the guts because it was hard to remind myself that that is NOT my friend in a box, only the wrapping paper. She was a really groomed dresser (not like me) always had her nails coloured, hair coloured, and her remains were beautifully dressed. They had put her body in a lovely burgandy coat. I am sure that this was a good decision for her and her family. Last night I told my son that if he is in charge of my remains he can put my body in a sack. Keep the nice clothes for the living. Feel beautiful in your shirts dear Rose. Take all dem drugs. Please God you have a good experience Friday. Sounds like your team are great. XXX Susanna",

Truly the mortal remains are the wrapping paper, not the gift. My dear next door neighbour died yesterday afternoon. We have been neighbours 12 years, and you could not wish for a more lovely neighbour. She had BC after me and got a recurrence, mets in liver and bile ducts, only discovered less than 2 weeks before her death. Unbelievable. Despite the sorrow I thank God she was spared a long illness. Her family have told me she was lucid right before the end, I truly think she had a blessed death. I have noticed over my life that people who are dying from an illness (not a sudden death) often seem to get some little graces in their timing and may be able to go when the one person who could not have coped with being there had taken a break to step out of the room, or they can hold on for another person who needs to be there to get to their side. I pray that grace for anyone who needs it. Dear Rose it is not hubris. It is human. Our normal instincts as mothers are always to protect and care for our children, at any age. That is why Moms in their 80's (like mine) still worry about their children's well being.",

Green lasers in room would illuminate a little spider in its web in the place in the ceiling where some of the lasers were installed. It was there every day.

You will not believe that it is completely new to me that these ferns are called Fiddle Head in the US - here they are known as Shield Ferns, and the curled stage is called the Bishop's Crozier. In biology in school we studied them as Dryopteris Filix-Mas! So many names for such a wonderful plant. I was on an outing with my photography club on Tuesday night and although we were up in the Wicklow hills to photograph the sunset I spent most of the time on my hands and knees among the ferns and dandelions.

And there are the same in my parents house. But I do not believe any thought in the universe is ever wasted. They will all still be there. I watched the new version of the Cosmos series, with Neil De Grasse Tyson, on Netflix recently. Although it was a \"science\" programme I found it was artistically beautiful, hugely spiritual and enormously comforting. I could hardly wait to watch each new episode, it was so good. Sometimes realising how small we are can be comforting. Another thing I found comforting was when he demonstrated over and over how everything in the universe is continuously remade. He said \"Nothing in the Universe is ever wasted\". That really struck a chord with me. Another interesting theme in the programmes was how often in human history one lone genius had come across a truth, didn't really matter whether it was by accident, by intuition or by brilliant work. In many of the stories he told this person is still not a household name. So often the forces of ignorance or corporate culture conspired to silence the person and keep the truth down. Yet always the truth prevailed. Sometimes it was due to heroic action, sometimes simply passage of time, but always truth will out. I saw many parallels in modern culture with the stories he told. I don't think all that much has changed, just different corporations or interest groups. But the message really was, it didn't matter, long run, even if the person died before their work came to fruition, it still bore fruit. It mattered. It had an impact. It made a difference. Definitely plant your bulbs. Spiritual and physical. Think of you every time I go out my back garden and see my foxgloves, which are still flowering due to a very mild Autumn.   ",
