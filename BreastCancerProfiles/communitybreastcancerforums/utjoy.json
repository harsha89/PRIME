My BS once suggested removing only the left breast & when I called to ask about the ps was told they had me down for NO recon! I want both removed and TE's...I'm pretty sure I'll have rads, too. I know that if I don't go 'all in' now I'll likely never do it...then I'll have regrets. Thing is, my husband is having major neck surgery August 28th...we'll be staying at our daughters as there's no way we can take care of each other. What a fiasco! ",

I've been driving since the 12th...had to, wasn't too bad since I only had a left side mastectomy (right side lumpectomy). Expect soreness...stabbing pains, numbness, someone on another thread described it as \"carrying a purse under your armpit\", that about sums it up for me except it is tender where the TE is! My missing nipple itches sometimes...arrggg (pirate day). I haven't even taken a tylenol in days. I'm not crazy about pain meds so didn't do any after the first couple days. My path report came back and I had 4 out of 6 nodes positive :( MO wants me to start Arimidex next week before rads the 1st wk of Oct. I might get one 'fill' in before, then will have to hope for the best later on that part...I know preventing a recurrence is far more important, but, it still bums me out. The margins were clear in the breast, however, there was DCIS in there, too! Lurking...it's hard to keep the imagination from running away. I have always been one who researches thoroughly, yet, I now know what \"one step at a time\" means...I have not been the least bit interested in 'jumping forward' in my searches...only when it's nearly upon me! Then, I don't want to look back at where I've been...very different to how I've previously reacted to other challenges in my life, which also gives me the insight into how cancer changes us. I didn't see these tiny changes coming. Nor did I expect to get so aggravated at the drama in the world! I have zero patience for it...alas, I must come to terms with it as an employer...ha. Good luck ladies...these battles will be won, we WILL survive them, hopefully with scars we're proud of. I have to say I've showed anyone interested what I look like...lol. My teenage grandsons included...what sweet caring boys they are...even my son-in-law...and my little granddaughter who's 2 1/2...she is so interested in 'helping' open doors, hold your hand, get things...",

It was all in the same facility so I was taken the 'back' way for privacy...the procedure wasn't bad at all. I had an ultrasound with a clip placement the week before that was not so great, it hurt but the wire placement wasn't too bad. It's all 'doable' because it must be done...dang it. I haven't had time to be 'down' as my DH had cervical spine surgery on the 23rd and ended up with complications and 2 trips to the ER...the last one the night before my surgery, he thankfully was put on a different floor than me (snark). He just got home (to our daughters) yesterday (9th) and is still not very independent. I've been traveling 45 min. each way to visit him at least every other day along with having to do what shopping I needed after my surgery due to his issues...(hence the snark!), I swear, men can be big babies, he tends to forget that I had surgery, too, & I must remind him that I can't 'help' him much...lol...I do love him, but, dang! I have some pain on the mx side...mostly, the one drain is annoying, incision on r breast is a bit infected...drainage is 30 to 35 cc's a day still. My rom is good, nurse told me to do the t-rex and ps said do not do the t-rex...I can reach out really good, up is tougher. Stripping the drains IS a bit hard, especially with taxol fingers. Still doable. I kept my scarf (beanie) on in the or cuz it was cold and was surprised that is was still on when I woke up! They were careful with my neck and I had no throat issues. All in all it is easier than chemo...I didn't really have time to mourn, don't know that I would have anyhow? I opted for TE w/alloderm sling, post pec (no choice, ps isn't sold on pre-pec at this point)...was able to save a lot of the skin, filled 100cc's during mx. Hang in there! One more hurdle cleared...this damn hill that turned into a gigantic mountain will be climbed & conquered by each of us...alone and yet quite a group of warriors who never knew we had it in us. :) I'm forever grateful for this forum and all who share their stories, pains, fears & triumphs. God bless.",

Alas, he lost a lot of muscle, balance & strength along with permanent nerve damage that we won't know the extent of for some time yet. My steri strips like me, too!

My next appt with the RO is the 17th for mapping. He told me that he'd rather I was not on AI's until after radiation, however, he said it's really just the old tradition and to go ahead with it if my MO recommended it. MO does still...
