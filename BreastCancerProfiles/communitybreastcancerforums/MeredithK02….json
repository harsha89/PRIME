One thing I'd caution: I imagined the side effects of things to be a lot worse than they were.  I think that because people post here when they've had a problem, it makes it seem like the problems are more prevalent than they are.  Not that it's going to be an easy road, but that it won't have every obstacle you'd imagine.  Or am I stretching that metaphor too far?  :-) I filled that time waiting for the mastectomy by watching movies and going out with a couple close girlfriends.  They talked about cancer however much I wanted to, but when I was ready to change the subject, we didn't have to wallow in my diagnosis.  That was invaluable.  ",
