No surgeon referral thats for sure.I got the silly duct out in routine surgery on July 2nd.The 1st paths could not find anything so they sent it far away.I stupidly figured no news is good news right? WRONG. I went by myself on the 31st for my post op check and results. it is cancer.I did not hear a word beyond that..I was so scared. I was sent home with no information, almost crashed my car and I was visibly shaken and distraught.I had to call my family Dr for an appt, no one called me. I went back yesterday, things are looking up, or they would be for someone normal.I have panic/depression/paranoia.She sais that she find 3 spots and the biggest was 1 MM easily missed..very easily.It was invasive...barely.Remember the duct excision does not take too much tissue. So she is very, very optimistic.I go for a sentinal node and lump next friday. The problem??? I don't trust what anyone tells me anymore, after waiting that long.I think she is hiding stuff etc.For what reason?Â  I went to my family dr today and he was pretty morose about the situation, he had the letter on the screen and I could see what she wrote and it is what she told me.I almost asked him if he was ok, he was either in shock OR feeling pretty guilty. I cannot keep in perspective that I may be ok..can anyone tell me that I need to relax? someone who has been through this..I am a wreck now..where will I be if I am stage 3 with node involvement?
