I had the surgery 3-4 weeks after ending chemo and was still on herceptin. BMX found complete pathological response. There was only a tiny spot of DCIS left. When I get anxious it is comforting to know that I am regarded as CPR. I wish I had done the sentinel operation before the chemo though. I saw 2 oncs. One suggested I did the sentinel op. first, then chemo and then the operation. The second onc + the BS did not recommend two surgical procedures. I opted to agree. Now I wish I hadn't. I think it might have given me more peace to know I was node negative even before the chemo. And if I wasn't I would have known I needed radiation. Which I didn't get because after chemo I was NED. Well, nothing to do now! It is a loop I choose to focus on the positive side of the list and I have another con. to add to the list: If your tumor does not respond well to the chemo, it takes more time until it is out of your body. It is also a risk.",

SE were mild, especially fatigue but could not sleep very well. I had my first treatment on my anniversary and instead of treating the red A as a devil, I imagined it as a celebration red baloon and the start of getting well and rid of the cancer. I finished chemo 2 years ago. No heart problems. As many of the ladies here, I go for the aggressive- kick ass approach! Hope chemo goes as easy as possible for you! Oh and I forgot - YES to the EMEND!!",

I'm a buyer for a retail company and of course could not travel abroad but except that part I went on as usual. The AC was a little tougher. I used to stay home for 2 days after treatment. The 12 taxol + herceptin were easier. I got the denser dose (once every week) and only missed the day of the treatment. I was a little more tired and worked only around 8 hour days, but felt focused and had good outcomes(yay!). I had a little chemo brain so I wrote every thing down and did not try to rely on my memory as I usually do. Everyone at work was very supportive, and I was very lucky. Good Luck to you!! It will be over before you know it.",

      "Content": "Apr 28, 2011 08:08AM - edited Apr 28, 2011 08:11AM by MaiTai Hi, I was 40 when diagnosed. Very similar to what you went through. Mamo on February 09 only detected microcalcifications. The doctor believed it to be benign and I was supposed to get checked again 12 months later. 3 months later I felt a lump on the right breast. It turned out IDC and multi focal (2 tumors with DCIS between them). I decided on a BMX too. I am not BRCA positive but I felt that I could not trust the Mammo and didn't want to obsess about the other breast. I had the BMX and immediaterecon  with alloderm January 2010. All in one procedure. For me it was the best decision. My daughter was 7 at the time. I worked through chemo but the surgery made me stay put for a month. The first 2 weeks I had the drains in. This was the hardest to manage and most uncomfortable. For the first 2 weeks I needed help to get up from the bed. I needed my DH for that. All the rest I could manage alone (bathing and such). My friends cooked for me, so I just had to heat it. Make sure you have comfortable clothes with front buttons. It is much easier to put on and take off. Especially if you still have drains. I had a hard time driving. Only after a month I was able to do it. I'm more than year away from the surgery and I feel really good. No movement problems or limitations. The recon is really nice. I just want to have my tattoos. I decided on not to recon the nips. My daughter accepted every thing very easily. I believe in open communication and believe that if she has the information and how I feel about it, it is much easy for her to deal with things. She asked to see the scars. She called the smiling boobs I haven't read the whole thread so maybe I'm just repeating what others have advised. I am here if you think I can help. Good Luck!",

I'm sure it will be more than a year when I finish at the dentist and I'm only ER+ (PR-), which I think makes me a little less sensitive to hormonal treatment. I'm afraid of SE especialy the harm it can do to the jaw. Any PR- getting the zometa? sgreenarch - Funny story about the zomera. greetings from TA",
