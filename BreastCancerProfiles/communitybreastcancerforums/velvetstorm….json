I went this morning and had the diagnostic mammogram and an ultrasound of both breasts shortly after. Now, I am waiting on the results. I know that the techs aren't really allowed to tell you anything and they certainly can't make a diagnosis. The lady that did my mammogram said she did not see any large masses. The lady who did my ultrasound said that there were no masses and that I had an enlarged blood vessel that was in the area of discharge. She said she didn't see anything suspicious, but I know that I can't put stock into what her opinions are. She told me to let the radiologist review my scans. Chances are the results will be in late tomorrow, early Friday. Its hard waiting when you have no idea what could happen.",

I have a lot left to lose, but as with anything it is a work in progress. There isn't any chance that I am pregnant. I have not had actual intercourse for a couple years. I do understand that there are a lot of possibilities for this nipple discharge, and I wasn't trying to get a professional opinion from anyone here. I just was looking for anyone who might have had similar problems and what their outcomes were. I'm sorry if I some how offended you with my post. I am scared and was looking for insight.",
