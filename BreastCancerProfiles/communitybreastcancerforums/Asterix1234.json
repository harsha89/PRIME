This is a big thing for us and where would I go for advice?  Friend, family??  Thank goodness you are here.  I was diagnosed in late July and could not be intimate with my DH, I felt \"different\", \"diseased\" and just could not.  At a time when I needed to feel his love, his acceptance, I simply could not.  I cannot imagine what he is going through or feeling and although we talk, feelings drown out words and the topic is lost. 2new4Dee - I purchased a tube top and work out bra (the kind that looks like a bathing suit top) yesterday, they hold a pleasant double purpose, I feel support against my chest which is comforting and I don't feel the skin move separately from the chest any more where surgery was...difficult to explain, but I think you might understand what I mean. This sensation of my skin sloshing on top of my chest was un-nerving.  The great thing about the tube top is that it does not hinder my infected SNB site.  I cannot thank you enough, and believe I will wear it constantly for the comfort it brings. Helena - reconstruction was not an option for me at the time of surgery, surgeon says that I will need to wait at least a year into treatment.  Then? Who knows? Going under the knife again is a little scary, I have also read the nightmare stories from women here about the pain involved with expansion, I had asked for \"skin sparing\" surgery, but he was not able to leave any, I will find out more details on the 25th. Where I have only one breast that is gone, I am concerned about \"matching\" them, I don't want to be pointing to the equator and drastically \"south\" at the same time.  DH says he is o.k. with my decision, whatever it may be and I have time to read more information and to give it more consideration.  Have you ever heard of duel implants for a mastectomy to make them even?  Prior to this experience, I often chastised men and my own hubby for putting far too much emphasis on boobs, but I see now that I have as well, it is part of my sexuality, part of being a woman, and now it is gone.  I have an indent on my chest where my little boob use to be and it will take some getting use to.  I miss.....me. Barbe - How intimate!  That sounds like one incredible man you have.  How did this happen? Did you ask him for help or did he initiate it?  I would be so worried about asking my husband to do something that horrified or grossed him out.  What a terrible thing...the very thought that my body would disgust him. This topic is so difficult as it digs into the personal at a deep level, but it is forefront in what I am dealing with, it is not me who was afflicted with cancer, rather my entire family.  Perhaps DH and I could go shopping in a month or so and pick out a few things together.  A little diddy with pre-filled boobs would work rather swell !! Thank you again for your honesty, for being open and for sharing.  If you have any additional advice or comments, I would love to hear from you again.   Gods speed. All the best and (hugs) to you all   -   Debra",
