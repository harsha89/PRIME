I am 36....diagnosed at 35 stage IV from the start. I went for my first routine mammo to get a baseline and the nightmare began. Had scans done prior to starting chemo and discovered several spots on my liver. Thankfully I responded well to treatment and was NED after the first three. I am due to be scanned Tuesday and feel the fear creeping up already. I am a single mom(though my ex husband is great...wish he had been while we were married!)to the sweetest almost 8 year old boy who is my life. My heart aches when I think of all I may miss down the road. I can't linger in those thoughts long as it is too much too bare. I am a manager at an animal hospital and absolutely love my job. I am also a \"parent\" to a crazy 9 year old jack russel mix. Between family, friends and coworkers, I have an excellent support system. That being said I value you all so much. As we all know, no one truly understands the road we are on but each other.",

I had three breast rumors, one known involved node and several liver lesions. I was NED after three treatments. I just had a scan on Tuesday and am waiting to see if I can just go on the P and H.
