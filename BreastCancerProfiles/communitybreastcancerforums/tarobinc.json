    "Content": "tarobinc wrote: I just found out that I carry the Chek2 gene mutation, that was passed onto me by my father. My only sibling is negative for the gene, thankfully. I would like to know what anyone is currently doing and/or what you experience has been. I see a genetic counselor in January of next year. Any information prior to me meeting with her would be greatly appreciated. I am feeling a lot of emotions right now and keeping a positive outlook since it was found and I will have a plan in place soon. Of note, my mom had stage 1 breast cancer last year, at the age of 68 and my maternal grandmother at age 44 and then at age 56. It was the reason why I and my OB had me tested.
