      "Content": "Sep 30, 2014 10:55PM - edited Sep 30, 2014 10:58PM by RFM68 Hello,  My results showed a small complex cyst. They did not feel a biopsy or aspiration (hope I got that correct) is warranted at this point. They will follow up with another diagnostic mamo/ultrasound on the left side in 6 months. I do get similar cyst on my ovaries that are watched on a yearly bases. They have dissipated. Perhaps they have found a new home in my breast. All kidding aside. The radiologist stated these types are all hormonally fueled. At this point, with all of my other female related issues, I would welcome menopause with open arms! Most of what I read in regard to the cysts sound promising. But I suspect, there is always that small chance. They marked \"probably benign. CYA.  I have a friend that is a radiologist. He would like to see my work up to provide another opinion. As this is all new, is a cyst generally left alone? Couple of my friends have had further testing after the discovery of a test. The center I was at today is extremely high tech and progressive compared to my small community hospital. Was pretty impressed. Hopefully they know their stuff ;). Thank you for your thoughts and opinions! ",

I have a heart condition and have met a number of great people (in another forum) Many years ago. They have become lifelong friends!  I am 46. Have been having my yearly 2D testing. Other than dense breast tissue. Up until (2) days ago. Have not reported marked issue. There is a change in my tissue (left breast) from 2013 - 2014 testing. They are noting asymmetrical changes in the left. Inconclusive. Suggesting further testing. Scheduled for a 3D mammogram with ultrasound tomorrow. Was none the wiser about the 2D vrs 3D until this issue surfaced. Of course in the interim, have managed to scare myself silly.  Did a self exam and think I feel something. May all be in my head at this point. The good news is, I know BC is very treatable with early intervention. Any words of wisdom greatly appreciated! Thank you!  Log in to post a reply",

Also have the opportunity to get these results read by another set of eyes (not related to the center I use). Keep us posted on your progress. It sounds like all will be well. 30 years is a long time to be walking around with something. Surely if it were BC, you would have known long ago. Take care. ",
