I mentioned it to the onc nurse and she said if it was still bothering me on Monday, we'd check it out. The next night I went to the ER because it hurt so much to breathe, turn my head, bend down or raise my arm. I wanted to tough it out since the nurse didn't seem that worried the day before but I was afraid it might be something serious. They did an EKG, lung X ray and cat scan and determined it was pleurisy. They gave me an IV of and a prescription for prednisone for the fluid and dilaudid for the pain. I went home and felt better by Sunday. While taking the Prednisone last week, I didn't have the pleurisy problem. I hope it stays that way. When I told my rad onc yesterday that the ER said it was pleurisy, he said radiation doesn't cause that. I'm glad I've read this thread because now I know it's more common than he's telling me. This week though, I've had bouts of dizziness that come and go. Is that a side effect of radiation?",
