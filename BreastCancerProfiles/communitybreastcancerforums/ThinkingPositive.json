Second time I was given the NCCN guidelines for stage 2 invasive ductal carcinoma and shown that both were regimens that were used. I already have my date to have port placed for Monday, I have an echo scheduled for Wednesday in case I decide to go ACT regimen....now just need to let them know which regimen by tomorrow so I can get the chemo scheduled. Really having a tough time with this.. heart risks with the ACT bothers me, but since I am grade 3, that means its pretty agressive..I am assuming thats what spread to the lymph node, which makes it aggressive as well...but it didn't go any further...the report did say extracapsular invasion, don't know exactly what that means.. But the other 16 nodes were negative.. I did have a mastectomy and the resection margins were negative, 10mm or more away on all margins... The ACT is 4 treatments every two weeks then once per week for 12 weeks...the TC is 4 treatments every 21 days.. Has anyone had to choose between two regimens?? If anyone can give me your reasons for choosing the treatment you chose it would be so helpful... I don't want to make the wrong choice... I will also be on hormonal drugs for 5 years after and possible radiation after chemo. I posted this in the chemo..before after and during to hopefully get additional responses...

IDC, Stage 2A, 1.1cm, grade 3, 1/17 nodes, ER+/PR+ HER2 Negative, I have high blood pressure, last bone density a few years ago, I was diagnosed as osteopenia... have read that Adriamycin is terrible on the heart, my maternal grandfather died of a heart attack and both my mother and father had high blood pressure.. not sure if this will make me more of a risk of developing heart problems. Going back to the oncologist today to discuss again, was there last Thursday..my husband seems to think the side effects and lasting side effects are not worth doing the chemo unless the percentages are going to decrease the risk by alot. Does anyone know how much these two regimens reduce the risk of it coming back and/or killing any thing that might be floating around... in addition to doing the 5 years hormonal drugs.. My husband is worried that I am 58 and will become 70 once chemo is done. I was told that I could do just hormonal if I so chose, but adding chemo to the plan would bring down the percentages of recurring and killing cells that may have strayed. What I was not told was the percentages for each one.. all I know is that there is the first one that is standard of care... I am guessing it was suggested since the tumor was grade 3 and one lymph node was positive. But it seems as though that is the standard of care for people with stage 3 as well...in some cases.. Just worried about being over agressive with treatment if there is really no need or benefit ?? Are there any other tests that they will do besides echocardiogram before starting chemo?
