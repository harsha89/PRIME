I made an appointment that day and I was told it was normal. It was still bugging me so I got a second opinion. Same diagnosis from the second opinion. However, she agreed to order a sonogram for me so I could drop it. Well, I got a sonogram and I'm still having a hard time letting it go. Some of the reasons contributing to my inability to drop it are: I have never heard about indentations on the breast. I can't seem to find anything that says they are normal. I looked at my breast at both of the doctors' offices and the fluorescents make it incredibly difficult to see. In regards to the sonogram, I am breastfeeding and I don't know if that affects it. Are indents normal? Can the fact that I am breastfeeding affect the outcome of a sonogram? Should all of this including my age, 23, make me feel not worried? Log in to post a reply",
