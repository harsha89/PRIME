I will def keep all you amazing ladies posted! We are hoping it will come back as a cyst and that will be the end of it. :)  If it is a cyst do they do anything about it? Are cysts normally pain free?  On a different note even thoe this lump is pain free I have been having TERRIBLE neck pain and headaches. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh. I am hoping it's just from stress and tension and nothing to do with this other issue. Prayers are welcome and THANK YOU VERY MUCH in advance!!! Big hugs!",

Even the posts that were not so tender, LOL. I needed to hear them. @Kimmer.. WOW! We have the same sort of thing going on. Thanks so much for sharing. I will keep you in my prayers! I did call the place where I am going to get the CT scan done at and asked if I would be finding the results that day. She basically said more than likely not because either way it would need to be reviewed by a radiologist... Then they would get the results to my Dr, and then they would tell me at a follow up visit I assume. :) I hope the technician can give me a little clue like yours did you. :) It will def make my mind more easy. This lump in my armpit is about 1-2cm as well. It is def not shrinking or going anywhere, but I know that doesnt nessesarly mean anything. Thank you again ladies! I will find out more (hopefully) on Nov 9th!! :) ((( BIG HUGS!!))) p.s. can someone please send me a inbox message? for some reason I dont think my inbox messages or working. lol Just want to test it. TY in advance!",

I have a few close friends that think I need to get the biopsy done. What do you all think? If the doctor \"THINKS\" its a blocked sweat gland, should I just go with it, and leave it alone? Or talk to my doctor about getting a biopsy. I was thinking if it grew anymore, I would def try to set up a biopsy. Let me know your thoughts. xo!",

The CT tech, and Radiologist were not breast specialists, and I think I would feel more comfortable KNOWING for sure that this isn't something serious. I really have a hard time believing its a blocked sweat gland, when reading up on a blocked sweat gland this is not it by the symptoms people describe. Do people typically get a response from a CT \" I think this is what it is\"? I don't think that will settle well with anyone considering all the harping one recieves on \"Get it checked, get it checked\".. and we all hear it everywhere. The sooner the better, Do it now.. Etc.  I want to know FOR SURE that it's nothing... I am waiting on a call back from my primary care doctor, to talk to her or her nurse about this. Bottom line, I don't feel comfortable with \" I think\" being the diagnosis here. I know everyones circumstances are different. I had a friend years back that went to her Dr. for the same type of thing, they told her the small lump was from her drinking too much caffeine. She went home, 3 years later cancer had spread all over her body, and she passed away a few years back.  My point being, I don't think \" I think\" should be acceptable. Or I would like a 2nd opinion from a breast specialist, and a new CT scan from a breast specialist. Then maybe the biopsy. We shall see. I do appreciate everyones opinion, support, Etc.. Xo!",
