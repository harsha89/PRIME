I have been reading these forums since my diagnosis, so I figured I would finally join and post. Staymom- my nausea was really poorly controlled and nothing I did helped. I ended up calling the on-call Oncologist fellow at my hospital for a change in prescriptions three times before they finally sent me to the e.r for iv medication and hydration. I think sometimes there isn't anything you can do on your own until they figure out what medication works for you. ThePinkRibbonEffect- I am using cold caps. So far I have zero hair loss. But I do have weird, very dry hair. They hurt. I am unsure if I will continue, but I had a mohawk for seven years and am not overly attached to my hair. I feel like the pain and hassle could be more worth it to someone who is more attached to their hair than I am learning I am. M0221- I was awake for the entire time my port was placed. It was not a bad procedure. I had some pain for about two to three days after, and I have discomfort when my cats walk on it now. It has been in about a month and while I think its weird (I'm thin and can feel it and the catheter) it is a lot less weird than my tissue expanders, which is something.",

She said it works on about 85% of patients, though they have no idea why. It seems to have worked well for me, as I experienced no bone pain with my first shot. Has anyone else had this recommended to them?  Also, I went through five different medication combinations before they settled on reglan and benadryl to control my motion sickness-like nausea. I guess since I'm thirty I am more prone to strong and long lasting nausea, at least that's what the nurse said. Is anyone else on a non-first line medication combination to control nausea? I'm interested in some more possible combinations to discuss with my oncologist.",

I'm glad to hear some other people have been recommended the Claritin for bone pain. I wanted to ask because I am going to the Cleveland Clinic and they can be special in both good and bad ways. I found my second A/C infusion went smoother than my first. They hit me with harder anti-nausea drugs, which seem to be helping. Whomever commented about the strong hunger (so many posts between now and when I last logged in), I have that issue as well. My anti-nausea med works by emptying the stomach quickly. I find myself needing to eat small meals every two hours. Even in the middle of the night. If I eat too much or not enough my stomach is incredibly unhappy. I find myself eating cereal, scrambled eggs, and green juice to get me through these three-four days after my infusion. Is anyone else having weird sleep issues? I can get between 4-6 hours and then I'm awake for at least two, then tired again, and can pass out for another three. Normally I am a nine hour a night gal. I've read exercise can help with this, but I don't think I'll be ready to brave the gym for another week yet. I was taking melatonin prior to chemo, but I feel like everything I'm on now is just laughing at it. Summer2016- good luck on your cold capping! I gave up on mine because I decided I just don't care about my hair (and I imprinted my nausea on them, even seeing the cooler makes me sick). It's short now and I had a mohawk for seven years prior - so many years of mostly bald. But I think cold caps are amazing and wish lots of success for you. I have yet to lose anything and I'm three days out from infusion two. My mother lost all hers on day ten after her first A/C, so even the first cold capping session must have had some level of success with me. My family doctor also wrote me a prescription for the generic version of Latisse (sp?). I'm hoping it will help me keep some eye brows and lashes, but who knows. I use it nightly. I find everyone's updates helpful and appreciate the amount of mutual sharing. It's good to hear from others how things are going, so thank you all for sharing!",
