Will meet with someone next Monday about radiation and have chosen the SAVI, but am having second thoughts. Your words are helping guide me. Even though my mother had breast cancer at age 22 it doesn't take the sting off to hear the word cancer...even though I'm 62. You all bring tears to my eyes that there are women, outside of my loving circle of family and friends, who are so supportive and helpful.",
