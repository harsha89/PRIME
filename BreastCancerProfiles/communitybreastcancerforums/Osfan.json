    "Content": "Oct 12, 2014 08:16PM Osfan wrote: I am 3 days post op after a bilateral mx and DIEP done at Mercy Hospital in B'More by Drs Neil Friedman and Bernie Chang.  They were both strongly recommended to me and I have no complaints about the entire process from pre-op until today. Way too early for results but I am told they are both highly regarded.   Dr Chang said he has performed more than 2500 DIEPs and currently trains fellows for the surgery.  So far, I feel good about my choice.  Feel free to PM me. ",
