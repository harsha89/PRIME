I've been defending him to others ragging on him about this affair because the story originated with the National Enquirer. They are not exactly known for top notch journalism. I am just so saddened and disheartened by this. THANK GOD he is not the presumptive nominee!!!!  I would never in a million years vote for him now and I was a huge fan before. All this time I though Elizabeth was so lucky to have such a caring and supportive husband. I admired the way she stood up and said she wanted him to run in spite of her medical condition. I think she is an amazing woman and after this news, I have more respect for her than ever. I hope whatever happens in her marriage, that she is happy and loved and at peace with her situation. Forgiveness is not easy and I suspect John was lucky enough to receive it once, but apparently did not appreciate it enough to not do it again. What ever Elizabeth decides, I\"ll respect. As everyone in a long term relationship knows, leaving is easy ~ staying and working it out is the hard part. Please be gentle in your judgements, you never know if she is going to read these posts.",

Two weeks later I am getting a lumpectomy and lymph node biopsy having been diagnosed with Breast Cancer. I am still trying to comprehend how I got from point A to point B, but the simple fact is ~ when something is wrong with your body, go to the doctor. Your best chance at staying healthy, is to consult a Dr. when something doesn't feel right. From what you have said (and not said) you have something that doesn't \"feel\" right. Please, take a deep breath and pick up the phone. You could be worrying yourself sick for nothing more than an underlying infection that is causing your problem.

I'm neither stage IV nor a mother so I can't even pretend to know what you are going through. I can only tell you that 2 years ago I lost my best friend to this darn disease. Back then I didn't realize how much I didn't know about the treatments, the toll, the fight. When my friend called me to tell me she had decided to stop treatment, I was devastated. I felt like she was quitting on all of us that loved her. I of course, did not say that to her. I outwardly supported her and loved and held her until the end. But inside, I was heartbroken she didn't have it in her to fight...because I was going to miss her so, SO much. Even now, writing this...it breaks my heart all over again that she isn't here. But I now understand it so much more. Going through the past 7 months of my own cancer has given me a much deeper appreciation for what it took for her to say \"enough is enough\" and appreciate how brave she was. I am so glad to read you are doing better, I am so glad you had this forum where you could scream and cry - and have people here who understood, didn't judge, listened. Thank you for reaching out. No matter which road you had taken, you would have received the support you so obviously deserved. I love this \"place\"!",
