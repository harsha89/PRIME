I just wanted a bit of reassurance as I had a scan last week, Thursday 28th, at the breast clinic and was told \" it looks like a cyst but I will let breast specialist have a look and he may want to do a mammogram, but I think he will probably discharge you\" A much relieved and happier me went on my way, only to arrive home from work 4 days later on Monday 1st, to a letter from the breast clinic with an appointment for another scan, a mammogram and a biopsy on Friday 12th!! I rang the clinic (as it is my wedding anniversary that weekend and we had planned to go away) to ask if I could attend any earlier, only to be told Dr is only in that day and he wants to see you, I am now panic stricken. Are they being over cautious because of my history ??, have had cervical cancer and ovarian cancer, and my maternal aunt has had breast cancer, but apart from that there is no other history. I would appreciate hearing your opinions on this as I am really clueless, one minute I'm fine and think I'm over reacting and the next I'm thinking the worst Log in to post a reply",

I do feel deep down that it is probably just a cyst so am trying to put it to the back of my mind. So glad I found this site, just to be able to share with others lightens the load x",

Today I arrived home from work to yet another hospital appointment letter, I rang to see what it was, and explained that I go for my tests on the 12th, this appointment is for the 17th. The lady on the other end informed me that this new appointment is for my results ! ! Glad they're going to be back that soon but a bit worried that they have already lined an appointment up, do they know something already based on the scan????? Think I might go bury my head in the sand until Friday, if only there was an off switch the brain, mine is definitely working overtime",
