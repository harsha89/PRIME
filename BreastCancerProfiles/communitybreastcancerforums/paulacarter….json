I had radiation in 2001 and so, it's been 10 years and back again.  I am scheduled to do reconstruction at the time of the mastectomy but my gut and my overall feeling of - 'no more of this' is telling me to forget the reconstruction and just have the mastectomy. This is my left side only- so I would have one breast left..but after reading some of the forum comments on reconstruction - I am not inclined to do this. I am almost 59 (in a week) and also have had thyroid cancer 3x...so, like I said  - ready to be done with this. All of you seem quite ok with  no reconstruction...and I am starting to join the fold on that philosophy.",
