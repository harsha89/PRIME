I didn't have the heart to cut me hair short because I just grew it out for the first time in 30 years! Go figure that I'd have to have chemo after I just accomplished that! It's thinner to me, but just looks normal to everyone else. I hope my hair thickens back up after my final round March 22. I'm going to Cabo at the end of June and would love to have decent looking hair. The grey grow-out is the worst for me. I've colored my hair every 4 weeks for years and now I'm going through tons of cover-up! I haven't lost my eyebrows and lashes completely, but they are thinner. I'm using Essential Eyebrow Solutions on my eyebrows to help thicken them, so we will see. Have a great weekend!",

They are going to be a major pain, but they seem to have pretty good results because of the adjustable caps. You really have to have a capping partner to run the capping all day for you. You have to get dry ice that day unless there is a biomedical freezer for cold caps at your facility. Depending on your treatment plan, they have to be changed every 25 min. from about an hour before, all during and for 4 or 5 hours after your infusion. That makes for a long day for your cap partner. Some areas of the country have access to professional cappers, but it is expensive. I will be the first to cap at my infusion center and my MO was very hesitant to support me in doing it because he's not convinced that the safety has been proven. I'm convinced that the long term use in Europe is good enough for me. If you have access to a center with a cold cap machine it's much easier. No need to get dry ice and change the caps every 25 min. Unfortunately, I live in Missouri and we are always a step or two behind! Good luck with whatever you choose. This may not work for everyone, but I'm willing to give it a try. There is a cold cap group if you haven't checked it out on here in the Managing Side effects forum - Cold Cap Users Past and Present, to save hair. They offer a lot of great advice on cold cap use.",
