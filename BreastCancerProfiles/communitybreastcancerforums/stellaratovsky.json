I started my treatment right away I have been feeling great. Maybe the Meds are working. I went to my regular family doctor just to check everything else and he did blood work. I get a phone call today. He is telling me to get an ultra sound on my abdominal because my blood level was a bit high. Normal is 104 mine came back as 119. The doctor told me not to worry. He said he is 99% sure it's nothing. This doctor awesome he is not the onc but he is the doctor who found my original lump in 2009 and he is the doctor who also send me for pet scans and bone scans. He is very careful. He checks everything. If he says it should be fine and he thinks I am 99% fine. Should I get into panic mode or it should be fine. I am 40 years old and my body is just going through a roller coster. Log in to post a reply",

After my Thursday appointment all the happiness is down the drain. my back starting to act up again not as bad as the first time around it is actually manageable. But was stressed me out was my tumor makers went up to around 600. It was never low but it was always like 239,293, 337, 244 and know 600. All other tests are good like circulating cell search from 4 it went to one and other things that were high are lower know. I am confused what is going on. Another thing I have scans this week very worried. I am just scared. I put up a front in front of my kids but when look at them My heart hurts for everything they are going through. I need to stay strong for them. It is so wrong that my ilness affects them like that. I feel like I am taiin there child hoods away. I am just taking and taking I need to shut up.
