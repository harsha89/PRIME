I've had 10 rounds of taxol, when finished I'll get another 4 rounds of AC. A lot of posts in this topic are from people who've finished chemo. Like I said, I'm only halfway through, but already looking forward to the regrowth of my hair. I asked my onc if it was okay to start taking biotine now and he said it was no problem, but I only read about people taking it post chemo. So I wonder if it really can't hurt taking it now? Are there other things you did while on chemo to ensure good hair growth once finished?",

My hair is very full, but I HATE myself with short hair. I feel ugly, not feminin, it really makes me so sad. I have also inquired for extensions, but it won't be untill summer before I can get them, my hair is too short right now. If it was cheaper, I wouldn't hesitate, but extensions are going to cost me +/- 400 euro's (I'm from belgium) for 3 months! What do I do after? Get them again? That's another +/- 400 euro's.... That's a LOT of money. If it would be a one time thing, okay... but after those 3 months you have to put down the money once again or return to your short hair :( I hope my hair will grow much faster once I'm done with herceptin, but I'm afraid it won't make that much of a difference...",
