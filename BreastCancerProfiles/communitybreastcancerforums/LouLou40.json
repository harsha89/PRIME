I tolerated the Chemo and Herceptin well only minimal SE's from Chemo, just fatigue and a bit of nausea, my blood counts were great the whole time and I didn't require and Neulasta. I didn't even have a cold through Chemo and I have little kids. I have no residual effects from the Chemo 1 yr on except menopause. I didn't notice any SE's with the Herceptin and went back to work as a nurse as soon as I finished Rads. Hormone therapy has been the tricky bit for me, Chemo sent me into Menopause so I went onto Arimidex with 3 months blood tests to check I was still in menopause, however my bone density has dropped at an alarming rate due to no estrogen also I'm white and small framed which are also risk factors for osteoporosis. My Onc has stopped Arimidex or any other AI for good and started Zometa for the osteoporosis. I am not on any hormone therapy now as Tamox would have only given me a 2% reduction in risk of recurrence as my hormone receptors are low, so while I'm in menopause I have low estrogen so I'm comfortable without anything. Will review if my period returns. ",

If you are considering having a Mastectomy you would be wise to do it before Rads and consult a Plastic surgeon for advice on reconstruction options. Once you have had Rads the skin is much thinner and impants may not be an option. Some women do not require Rads with a Mastectomy some do, your BS can advise if you would need Rads with a Mastectomy. LL LL",

DH still went to work each day to pay the bills and I managed to get to get a rest when the kids were at school and day care. I drove myself to treatment and was lucky in that I stay really well, I was very fit and healthy before I started so I'm sure that helped.
