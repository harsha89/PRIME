I have a yearly shop physical coming up on the 6th of this month, probably going to ask if they can check the lump.",

I would agree that she isn't taking this seriously and might need to go to a specialist or put up a fuss in person, but would rather not start off on the wrong foot with new doctor. The hospital boasts that they have same day appointments so really not seeing the problem on her end. Traveltext. There is no breast cancer in family but there is other types of cancer. I was overweight but lost ~45 pounds so not much overweight now. I tend to think that my condition is probably gynecomastia from what I understand. But reading symptoms of gynecomastia and cancer are pretty much the same and get no concrete answers from reading them either way.",

However the search continues with another appointment for Breast Ultrasound with SVWC BC US 1. Another week of waiting and probably beyond.",

      "Content": "chasem wrote: I recently got a new doctor. Seen her once about a month ago for new patient physical so far. Two weeks and two days ago I noticed a lump in my breast and wanting it looked into ASAP I called her office and spoke with a nurse there. Explained the situation that a lump was found and not sure when it first appeared. I was told to call back in two weeks if it doesn't go away. Two weeks go by and called them yesterday telling them it hasn't gone away. This time she said give it till my next appointment I have set for one month from now. My question, is this normal, shouldn't she have me come in to at least feel it and say yeah or nay to further tests . Why make my anxiety peak not knowing if it is cancer or not. Did anyone have a doctor put you off for 6 weeks to get you into exam? If it makes any difference I am a 53 year old male. Log in to post a reply",
