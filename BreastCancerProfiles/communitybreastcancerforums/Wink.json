I'm usually pretty good through lunch - it's the afternoon & late night munchies that get to me!  I need to drink more water too.  We had a PT who specializes in lymphedema speak at our last ACS support group meeting.  She said that you need to drink 1/2 oz of water for every pound you weigh - man - I'll be spending half the day in the water closet! OK, could have done better at lunch.  Chicken Taco salad (no sour cream) with a few chips.  Low fat peanut butter frozen yogurt with a squirt of Hershey's chocolate (it was soooo yummy) and water.",
