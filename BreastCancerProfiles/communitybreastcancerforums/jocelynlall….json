No one asked me about my period beforehand so I (wrongly) assumed it didn't matter. Apparently when they put my catheter in they found and removed it, and wondered what it was! They did keep it for me though, which was nice.  Afterwards in my room they just gave me a pad to position on my bed and some truly (un) sexy underwear.  ",
