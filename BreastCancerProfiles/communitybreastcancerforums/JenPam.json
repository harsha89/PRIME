The mammogram showed what appeared to be a 1.3 cm. tumor. The radiologist said, after the biopsy, \"We have to do more work to figure out what stage we are.\" He recommended removal of the tumor and sampling of the lymph nodes, both of which were done in July during my BMX surgery. Is it typical for a BC patient to be staged prior to surgery? Genny, sorry to hear neoadjuvant chemo didn't work in your case. I've read so many stories here of amazing neoadjuvant responses that I've tended to believe it is always effective! You're so right about not having clearcut answers (but I want them anyway). ;) homeschool, I see you're dealing with the same staging uncertainty. I don't know why it matters to me, but I guess there's some sense of control in knowing where I stand (even if I can't control what happens from then on). Interesting that you're also receiving adjuvant Perjeta--that's unusual, from what I've read. My MO approved it for me, and I'm his first patient receiving Perjeta adjuvantly. I hope treatments are going well for you! live_deliciously, you're right, anything is possible. My nodes had appeared unremarkable throughout the whole shebang until the BS got a close-up look at them during surgery. Tectonic_shift, I wish there were a better way of determining cancer involvement in the nodes. Sorry to hear about your nodes. Duzy, good luck with your surgery tomorrow, and I'll keep my fingers crossed for boring nodes! pennsygal, I wasn't told about mammograms/sonos underestimating tumor size. I certainly wouldn't have imagined my tumor to be 400% larger than predicted! JerseyGirl, Warrior On! I appreciate everyone's insights--thanks!      ",

Even though I was never staged pre-surgery, I imagine I'd have been considered stage IA, since my doctors thought I was T1, N0, M0. Instead, I turned out to be T3, N3, M0--stage IIIC. Are you considering a mastectomy? I imagine your surgeon will want to remove all of your sentinel nodes on the affected side, if she hasn't already done so, and then will take axillary nodes for testing as needed. Please keep us posted! I found this interesting (from breastcancer.org): An important point some people have trouble understanding is that the stage of a cancer is determined only when (or soon after) the cancer is diagnosed. This stage does not change over time, even if the cancer shrinks, grows, spreads, or comes back after treatment. The cancer is still referred to by the stage it was given when it was first found and diagnosed, although information about the current extent of the cancer is added (and of course, the treatment is adjusted as needed). For example, let's say a woman is first diagnosed with stage II breast cancer. The cancer goes away with treatment, but then it comes back and has spread to the bones. The cancer is still called a stage II breast cancer, now with recurrent disease in the bones. If the breast cancer did not go away with the original treatment and spread to the bones it would be called a stage II breast cancer with bone metastasis. In either case, the original stage does not change and it's not called a stage IV breast cancer. Stage IV breast cancer refers to a cancer that has already spread to a distant part of the body when it's first diagnosed. Here at BC.org, if someone's cancer metastasizes, she considers herself to be at stage IV. According to the guidelines noted above, she should consider herself to be her original stage \"with spread to (site).\" I realize it's only semantics, but it's thought-provoking. Based on those guidelines, the only stage IV patients are those who were diagnosed stage IV at the outset. ",

If the size and involvement of my tumor had been evident from pre-surgical exam & biopsy, I'd have been given neoadjuvant treatment. I was thought to have had a ~1.5 cm. tumor, and my nodes appeared normal. Instead, after pathological testing following my BMX, it turns out I had a 5.5 cm. tumor and 22 positive nodes out of 25. *sigh* I often wonder whether it's just as well that I had the large tumor removed, since it was aggressive--but then I read how well other women's tumors respond to neoadjuvant chemo, and I wish I'd had that opportunity for treatment before surgery. I also like the idea of knowing for certain that one's body responds to chemo. As that's water under the bridge, I've been lucky to be offered adjuvant Perjeta for four infusions, which I was given in concert with Herceptin & Taxotere following four infusions of Adriamycin & Cytoxan. I meet with my MO in early January to discuss radiation, which I predict will be scheduled in late January. I'm supposed to have six weeks of daily rads. It's a relief to talk with other Stage III people.  ",

Let's say my biopsy/testing had revealed that my tumor was, in fact, 5+ cm. And then let's say I'd had neoadjuvant treatment, and chemo cleaned out my nodes--which nobody would have realized were cancerous, since that wasn't discovered until surgery. With that being the case, by the time surgery took place, my nodes would have appeared cancer-free--thus changing my diagnosis to IIB. Right? But wouldn't the actual reality of my cancer be the same (e.g., concerning prognosis) even though the doctors would consider me IIB in one scenario and IIIC in another scenario? I hope that makes sense. :D",
