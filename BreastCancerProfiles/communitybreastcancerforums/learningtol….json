For all I know, my lump may turn out benign (please God!). Just looking and learning as much as my brain will allow! I don't want to make decisions based on fear but rather be an informed patient. When I found out that 80% of all biopsies are benign to begin with, you have to wonder why all these biopsies in the first place? When I researched that and found out that it is the referring Radiologist who profits directly (they keep the fee for needle biopsies), you have to wonder if the \"suspicious\" lump was ever suspicious at all. As I said, women with a lump will do whatever recommended out of fear and doctors of all specialties know this. Profit could well be behind current standard treatments and diagnostic methods. It wouldn't be the first time and probably won't be the last.",

Sometimes, I wonder if the biopsy procedure itself is causing all these reoccurances of BC in survivors. Supposedly, these needle and incisional biopsies are safe, but I have my doubts. It makes sense to me that they would want to use a less invasive procedure of getting a sample of tissue for diagnostic purposes. Anyway, I wish you the best.",

After reading the article that the moderators of this site provided, it is interesting that the biopsy process for testicular cancer is to NEVER PERFORM A NEEDLE BIOPSY OR ANYTHING OTHER THAN A COMPLETE REMOVAL OF THE TUMOR. It is very interesting. Upon further research, there was a study done in 2004 called the Hansen Study that showed that there was a 50% chance for micrometastases to the Sentinal Node after Fine Needle Biopsy.

Did you have a needle biopsy first or did your doctor simply do a surgical \"excision\" biopsy from the beginning?

I am just doing research, that's all. I know nothing. Just because a particular study says one thing and another study disputes that doesn't prove either are right. As for assurances that something is safe, remember when gynocologists everywhere assured us women that HRT was safe to use for menopause and later those same doctors were proven wrong after the data came back showing it wasn't (Womens Health Initiative)? I pray you are right.",

It didn't really bother me all that much, though. I guess it is different for everyone. Well, while I have been waiting for results, I have been doing a lot of research and there is data out there saying that these needle biopsies can, themselves, cause the cancer to spread. Some having suggested that it causes what would have been a lower staged cancer to become a higher staged cancer later. I almost wish now that I had requested that they remove my lump \"intact\" before sending a sample off to the pathologist for diagnosis. I wonder how many BC survivors have had a reoccurance due to the biopsy procedure...oh, well, too late for me since it was already done. Now I have to wait for results.",
