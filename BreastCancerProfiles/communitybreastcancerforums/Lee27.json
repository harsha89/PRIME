Would that not have been a headline on the news if they had taken me to the Police station in error and found out I was a BC patient and nothing wrong with me.;-) Take care and buy those tissues.",

I've been lucky to have a boss that has compassion.  His wife needs lungs, but they say she's too healthy now. Go figure.  I hope you work for a larger company...I'd check out your rights with your HR dept. I hate to say it but it is true for me...men are much better to work with as your boss. Women can sometimes be so bratty at times in those positions. Her actions sound like it is all fear. I've gained friends and lost others during this journey. My very best to you.",

I'm 3yrs out this month.  When I had chemo, they also had me take Claritin--and a few others as a test--to keep some of the bone ache down. It worked for me! I took it a day after that Neulasta shot. Heck, I still use it from time to time. Especially when the rainy weather sets in. Some people purchased those chillo pillows. I just kept warm and cool pj's beside my bed for the hot flashes. They'll subside over time. Hang in there everyoody. Thinking of you all. Lee 27",
