      "Content": "peverson wrote: I am 56 and was diagnosed with IIIA breast cancer five days ago. It was half ductal and half lobular, grade 2. The original biopsy showed no lymphatic invasion, but surgery found cancer in 5 of 6 nodes. The original tumor was small and discovered during a routine mammogram; I could feel nothing, and I do routine breast self examinations. Apparently, I never learned to do them properly. Prior to surgery (mastectomy) on March 19, the assumption was that this was stage I; after surgery, the staging was changed (as you can see), and I'm still reeling. I still have one drain in, but I plan to get it out tomorrow, Monday. I begin dose dense chemo on Tuesday with Adriamycin and Cytoxan for 8 weeks (infusion every other week). That will be followed by Taxol for 12 weeks (once a week) and radiation. I'm not sure when I start taking the anti-hormone pills. This was an unexpected diagnosis, as I've never had a call-back mammogram in 17 years and didn't expect one. I am also still barely recovering from a months-long case of post-viral gastroparesis and 25-pound weight loss, so this diagnosis comes at a very challenging time physically. I know that this will not be easy, but I really do need some encouragement. My son is still doing follow-up for testicular cancer from summer 2009. Our family feels beat up.

      "Content": "peverson wrote: I've heard from several BC treatment survivors that it took about a year after treatment ended for them to feel kind of \"normal.\" I'm wondering about how you all did. I walk most days (was going to an exercise class until I pulled a muscle) and do PT for tight muscles in abdomen, back, and chest. I had my first surgery last March, then chemo for about 5 months, then radiation for about 2 months, then Femara, then a prophylactic mastectomy and salpingo-oopherectomy in December. I have trouble getting going in the morning and, if this makes sense, usually feel tired behind my eyes most of the day. Some days are better than others. It's not as bad as just after treatment ended, but I still feel frustrated with my lack of energy. I'm feeling some pressure to return to work and don't know how that will be. But I need that insurance. SO FRUSTRATED because I didn't feel like this when I got the initial diagnosis. It came as a big surprise--never felt the lump even when I knew it was there. So I'm trying to climb back and just feel down when I don't have the energy. How do you all avoid stories about cancer, as a side note? It's everywhere. I'd like to be able to ignore all those stories, but sometimes it's hard, especially when it's a kid. Then I freak out about those lymph nodes. I hate this disease. Sorry to be all over the place in this. Having kind of a hard day.
