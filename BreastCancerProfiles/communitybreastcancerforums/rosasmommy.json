That being said, you need to give yourself some time to process this.  Life will slowly adjust to the \"new normal,\" but allow yourself some time, as I put it, \"grieve for the life I almost had.\"  Feel to PM with any questions or just to talk.  Sending lots of love your way.  You are not alone -- we are all here to support you.  Post this on the Stage IV board, and I'm sure you'll get a lot more responses.  Natasha",

      "Content": "Dec 30, 2011 07:55PM - edited Dec 30, 2011 07:57PM by rosasmommy I've been doing Taxol and Avastin since April 2011. I don't have any experience with Herceptin, but based on my experiences with Taxol, the main SEs are hair loss, fatigue, and neuropathy.  I haven't had a real problem with nausea, as long as I eat little meals thoughout the day to keep something in my stomach (similar to what I did during pregnancy to fight morning sicknes).  I would shave her head when her hair starts to fall off (mine started to go after my second round).  She'll know it's starting to fall off because the hair follicles will start to hurt.  As to the fatigue, my oncologist always says that exercise helps with the fatigue -- a lot easier said than done, I know!!  That being said, on the days I am really fatigued, I do try to take a little walk around the block, and I find it perks me up a bit.  As to the neuropathy, you can get amino acids from Whole Foods or heath food store to take -- I can't remember the names or the dosages, but I'm sure the oncologist or the oncologist nurse can help.  I also second keeping an eye on the digestive track, as constipation can become a problem. I take a colace for the first few days after an infusion, and it does the trick. And don't be afaid to ask for anti-anxiety/anti-depressants to help during the first days of the diagnosis.  I take both, and don't know what I would do without them.  They really help keep the really dark thoughts in check. Good luck!  You sound like an amazing husband.  Remember to take time to take care of you too!  Take advantage of all the offers to help.  If anyone asks what they can do, tell them to bring food!  It is so nice to come from chemo and not have to worry about making dinner.  Having a friend coordinate the meal delivery service is also helpful.  Websites like 'lotsahelpinghands\" can help with that too. ",

I too find milestones to be so bittersweet - I do my best to enjoy them, but can't help but wonder where I'll be for the next one. And being a parent of young kids makes it so difficult. I never thought I'd spend my daughter's 5th birthday wondering if I'd be alive to see her turn six. I hope you enjoy the day as best you can, and are able to spend many more with your little ones. Sending one big hug across the pond!",
