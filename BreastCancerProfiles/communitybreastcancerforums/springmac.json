I've gotten annual Mammagrams and ultrasounds since. Lots of cysts, but nothing of concern. A few months ago, I began having back and shoulder pain, along with some shooting pains through my breast. I figured it was a pinched nerve. A few weeks ago, I felt a pretty large lump in my left breast. Because if it's size, I decided I need to have it aspirated, as I figured it was a cyst. I went to the gyno today, and she seemed concerned. Says she's certain it's not a cyst, and referred me to a breast surgeon. I don't really have any questions, other than has anyone had anything similar happen? Trying not to overthink it, as I'm aware of statistics and mist lumps turn out to be benign.

Heavy feeling, pain and such. 2.5 weeks ago, I noticed a lump in my right breast at the 10:00 position. Pretty large feeling. Went to the PCP who noticed it right away. She sent me for mammo and US if necessary. The US was necessary & the lump (along with many others) was found. I met with PCP today who told me I have fibrocystic breast disease and the mass appears benign. The diagnostic center recommended aspiration, but my PCP feels the surgeon will want to remove it completely. I'm not sure why. Can anyone explain the reasoning behind removal vs. aspiration? Thanks in advance!",

My dad died of cancer when I was 7, all my grandparents had it, and my brother died 10 years ago from cancer. That being said, I am worried every time I have a strange ache or pain. My suggestion to you is to go to a doctor. It most likely is nothing to be worried about, but you're going to worry about it until you get confirmation that it's nothing. I too experience that feeling of dread each time I go to the doctor. Go and see your primary doctor to see what he/she thinks. It's the only way you'll stop thinking about this. Thinking of you.",

Diagnostic center called me a few days ago, said no worries, follow up with PCP & recommend aspiration. Today, I met with my doctor. I started off by saying, \"so glad it's nothing, that's a relief\". She says \"Yes...but I wouldn't call it nothing\". She was upset that the diagnostic center called me. She said the report says \"appears benign\" which is great. BIRAD-2. I have very cystic breasts, which I know are common. She referred me to general surgeon regarding aspiration, but said she thinks due to the size of the lump in question (2.7 cm...doesn't sound big to me), that the doctor will probably want to do a lump removal. WTH? Has anyone heard of these kind of shenanegins before? Just curious. I made an appointment with surgeon for July 21st for consult. Log in to post a reply",
