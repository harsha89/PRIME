Me and the wig are not good friends- I do wear it when I don't feel like dealing w/ talking about the cancer etc or being stared at. However, as soon as the hair is covering the head- I am so ready to not have to worry w/ scarves, hats, or the wig. Sorry if I am whiney. I am trying to be a soldier, just not pulling it off today for some reason. Post exchange, no hair, just started arimidex blues I guess... When I do wear the wig I still have folks who see me rarely say \"i like your haircut.\" i usually just smile and say thank you. I just am too self conscious to do more.",

I just started arimidex- like you my MO wanted me to have a wash out period. I asked to start after the surgery so I would be on the med while I was off work after surgery. I have had 2 H alone. I don't seem to have a bad time- I do get tired and have a heavy feeling sometimes afterwards. The permanent implants are so much better than TE. More comfortable (and my kids will hug me again- they wouldn't because of the TE- felt too weird to them). It still feels like not like the real thing- but much better. The TE were tough when they were fully expanded. I look much smaller than w/ the TE- but that's fine w/ me. Not very vain these days w/ all the body image changes BC gives us all. DO hope the hair will come back soon. I started Nioxin 2 hoping that helps. BIotin is in the multivitamin I take- do look forward to getting my hair back. It didn't bother me much but now I just want hair as the no hair is a neon sign for us all isn't it??",

Never felt confident in the wig though.  Glad we have options- and we all need to do what makes us comfortable- we deserve that.

It's getting thicker more than longer- but am ok- once it's better coverage I really think I am going to stick  w/ that even though it'll be tough at first. Going back to work w/ a scarf was tough too- took a few days.

My hairstylist told me to not fight the curl. One day my teen daughter thought she'd try to straighten it. It was hilarious! I looked like I had a flattop cut! It was funny. We did it on a day I didn't have to leave the house over the holidays. We laughed & decided the stylist was right to just let it go. The good part is that really I can just wash and go at this point. I do miss bangs and hair over the forehead!!! Just glad about it coming back.
