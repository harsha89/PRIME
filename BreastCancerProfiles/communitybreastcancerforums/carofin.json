It seemed to encourage people to talk to me and smile rather than get that look of pity and concern on their faces. Also, I had a wonderful friend who accompanied me to each chemo - we talked constantly and allowed those around us to join in.  I actually had people asking to be put in the same treatment room as me for their next chemo.  The sharing of stories and concerns was great and we tried each others remedies.  Unluckily, I had every side effect in spades, so here are some ideas 1.  Baby pablum goes down quite well and does not generate the nausea that a lot of other foods do. 2.  Chewing ice when having flouracil keeps the nose tingling and stuff down.  Hug 3.  Rinsing your mouth with Canada Dry ginger ale helps the mouth sores - the cheaper ginger ales are not as good. 4.  Ice packs for the hot spots on your head and your eyes work wonders.  Hug 5.  Regular exercise is a must if you want to keep energy levels up. 6.  When you start the Taxotere, elevate the bed at your feet, keep your feet up as much as you can, raise your hands whenever possible.  The Tax causes peripheral neuropathy - a severe tingling.  The quicker the taxotere moves out of these areas, the less tingling you get.  Why those areas specifically - Gravity. Hug.  Take care ",
