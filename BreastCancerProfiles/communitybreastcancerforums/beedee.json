I'm yet to find something like what I have, besides IBC, and neither dr has given an opinion on what it could be, and they seem puzzled. I'm so scared. This is so hard to handle, at 19 I feel that this is a lot to deal with. I have so much fear. This is MY health, and I feel that the healthcare system is failing me, there should never be this much waiting, not with an issue like this.

I dont know much about it, it could very well be the cause of the thickening of my skin and the large bump above my breast. If any of you know anything about this, any info would be appreciated. The derm also did two biopsies to eliminate cancer as a possibility and put my mind at rest. Apparently there is a cancer which mimics morphea, and he wants to make sure it isnt that. He really thinks it is morphea though. So I'm just waiting for results. He put me on a strong steroid ointment and I will probably have to use a cream for the rest of my life. But it is much better than cancer and I am thankful to finally have some possible answers. Hopefully the biopsy results come back fine. Log in to post a reply",
