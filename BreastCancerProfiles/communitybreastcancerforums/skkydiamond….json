Renannsus-  do you have any expectation when you will be able to do upper bosy stuff?  Like after the implants are in?  I ask because i am going to join a dragon boat crew of all BC survivors, and rowing is involved.",

On other good news, my eyelashes and eyebvrows are returning, slowly but surely!",

Hollyin Mich-  I also have some nasty nerve pain in my upper right arm, as well as some numbness in some positions, it is so sore to the touch, especially my tricep muscle.  I had four lymph nodes removed on the right side.  Are these two things related? Thank God for pajamas, there the only things that feel soft and comforting right now.",

So I took some Advil for that, and I was ok. As far as my activity restrictions, I can vaccuum a little, but not the whole house ( does anyone want to go back to that?) Anything with repitition is still out, things like car washing and window washing, probably raking.  But I can try things out and see what I tolerate.  I should be able to join training camp for The Dragon Dream Team, a local Ohio all breast cancer survivor dragon boat team on April 30.   This is exciting for me as ihave wanted to be active more since before my treatment started but had no idea what the best exercise was for me except to walk. I could never find an activity that kept me motivated to keep exercising! Ok, turning off the light, watching some t.v. and eventually i will try to sleep!  goodnight, ladies!",

I don't think being in the hospital was better for pain management, contrary to what I thought before sugery!  If the nurses could have given me regular medication at regular intervals while there, but they didn't.  I was hungry right away, and have been glad to have an appetite with the medicine.  Taking an antibiotic as well. Had nipple sparing reconstruction with tissue expanders, hope the cancer side nipple survives intact, and my ONC took as much tissue as possible.  The other annoying part is the drains pull from time to time and are a nuisance, but emptying them and recording the fluid is not as bad as I thought.   The best thing is I was told no bra, and my drains are on a very comfortable velcro belt.   i made them find one at the hospital after they mentioned it.  keep on them for one if you want one, they do exist! I can keep the drains velcroed near my belly button so I can at least lay on my back and sleep sporadically without discomfort.  I am able to manage my pain better at home because  I didn't have to wait for a nurse to get meds.  At first, I was using the Percocet, along with Dilaudid for some leftover neuropathy from chemo in the hands and feet, but then I switched to Advil for the muscle pain, with the Dilaudid.  Tha's what the doc recommended, with the tissue expanders.   It really works!!!  So I feel really good, have help, including my mother in law, mother and husband.... but my mother in law is making it difficult.  She is supposed to be her to help with anything I need and the cleaning and cooking and stuff as my mom has to go back to work soon, and my husband is preparing his new business, but it appears she has no interest or intiative.  She just won't do it if it isn't like she does it at her house, which is the hard way.  or unless we can all praise her for doining it.  dont get me worng, she's a nice person, but if shes here to help, why is she on the couch with me? I brought her here even though my husband would prefer his mother not to be here (me too!), to give my husband a break.  He is starting his own business in the next month, and he needed to be able to make appointments and work with his new partner.  So far its not working that way.  Do I have to direct her?  I thought she would see things around the house and just do them. We'll time to rest again, will try to keep up with you gals over the next few days and weeks. Heather  Ugh... So far, my back must have been messed up from surgery and being stuck in that bed and not being able to move.  my surgery went well, and my sentinel node showed no cancer cells, so I finally am relieved to say that I am cancer free!  I forgot to call my oncologust today for the final pathology, but they told me they had a hard time finding the cancer on my right side, so that was good news.",
