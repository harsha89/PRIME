I joined this site to connect with \"real\" ladies to learn more about their experience. I had my first infusion March 7 and the SE have been non stop. My oncologist thinks it will get better next week. Yes the breathing issues were frightening. For 4 days i couldn't sleep n my breath was so shallow on the right side. From Monday-now I have had diarrhea. Imodium n pepto bismol doesn't work. Sharp pains come n go. I am integrating accupture into my care. I know my body is overwelmed by all these drugs. Did you have diarrhea? How many days did your diarrhea last? How did you manage it? Thank you again for reaching out to me. I look forward to keeping in contact with you. Have a wonderful day.
