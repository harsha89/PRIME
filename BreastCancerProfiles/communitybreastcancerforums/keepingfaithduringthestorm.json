The posts are such a wonderful source of inspiration and information thank you all for opening yourselves. My story, I am 34 weeks pregnant with twins I have had a VERY VERY rough pregnancy and have gone through some literally life changing events during this time. I never thought in a million years I would yet be faced with another challenge of having breast cancer during my pregnancy. I lost my Mother at 58 just 2 years ago to cancer it was an unknown primary cancer, I was her primary caretaker during her journey with cancer and it was a very difficult one and traumatic for me. I never thought I would would have to face this road again so soon. Although I am extremely grateful that it is DCIS, I was ER/PR positive I am still waiting on the BRCA to come back. I do have bilateral micro calcifications and dense breasts on mammo which is another reason I am leaning towards double mastectomy. My Surgeon recommended lumpectomy but I am opting for mastectomy she then agreed with my decision. There is no doubt I plan to have double mastectomy if the BRCA comes back positive. My mind is racing I just can't seem to turn it off there are so many thoughts in my head. I may opt for bilateral mastectomy either way as I do not want the worry of having cancer in the other breast years from now. I am in the process of seeing several Dr's as I want all the information I can get prior to making my decision. This is my first pregnancy and this itself was a journey getting here, and I have always dreamed of breast feeding so that is another factor that plays a role in my decision making. I can breast feed from one breast if I opt to keep it. I realize I could have mastectomy and reconstruction later on down the road but I really don't want to have to have two more surgeries especially with two kids running around. My decision I make will be one that is best for me and my family in the long run. This has all been very very devastating to me and I am trying my best to stay positive, it's hard when you are at home on bed rest unable to get out and about. I have been on bed rest since I went into pre term labor at 27 just turning 28 weeks pregnant. My pregnancy itself is making me miserable I am on meds to control the contractions all I want to do is have these babies and get on with my life. My questions to you beautiful ladies is just your - personal experiences especially if similar to mine - If you had implants placed are you happy with them (my concern is them feeling cold and not real) - and just your experience with your journey and why you made the decisions you made. Thank you ladies, I look forward to reading your responses! XOXO Log in to post a reply",
