I'm the single one of three girls,middle child, no children and a breast cancer survivor. My two sisters have really bonded since my diagnosis but then again, both are married and have children. They've never come to visit by themselves. We've fought about my weight gain, a huge 'image problem' in my family and them NOT believing I have trouble driving over 5-6 hours in order to visit them and family. Screaming about me having to spend the night because I get so sleepy. (I have sleep apnea.) I'm shocked at the lack of love, empathy and support from them. Very disappointing.
