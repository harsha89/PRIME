Allow yourself to dwell there if only briefly and remind yourself, this too shall pass. Soon enough you will be on with life or on a path to recovery. As my grandmother told me recently when I told her how sad I been at the thought of loosing her, \"don't waist today worrying about tomorrow. Tomorrow will come and there will be plenty of time to be sad. Let it wait for you to get there rather than you waiting it!\" she is smart lady!",

I read these boards all the time and never realized how helpful and supportive it would be to \"get my own response\" It has truly helped me.Â  I agree with you all! It is most likely benign since it tested that way, but no sense in leaving it in. There is no reason the doctor should think it is okay to bully me into depression and anxiety. After I get this out next week and if we find it is not Benign then I will search for a new doctor. I would rather have a Oncologist handle the case and refer to a surgeon as needed. (But not this one!) I feel so sorry for the very kind and nice Nurse practitioner who has to try to ease all the patients for this doctor. I hate thinking it, but she can't be this way to everyone. If she were she wouldn't be able to continue to treat patients. Thank you again everyone! Best wishes with all of your tests and I will try to remember to come back and update this with the results. Fingers crossed I don't have to switch to a different board (one where the diagnosis is cancer) My heart goes out to each of you suffering through this right now. I can't imagine surviving even more uncertainty. Be blessed!",

      "Content": "Dmpalmer wrote: Hey all - I am hoping for some perspective that I seem to not be able to google. Last October I found a lump on the side of my left breast, the PCP sent me for imaging. The first radiologist order an US. I watched as the technician focused on the lobulated lump(3), it's vascularity, and it's size(2x1). She left and came back with the radiologist who confirmed that they believed it was cancer and wanted to schedule a biopsy for the next day. The biopsy was performed by a different radiologist who also felt the characteristics were malignant. As I tried to make the mood light I jokingly asked if it just burst and was fluid filled. He said unfortunately it is not. He and the tech were sorrowful and told me that we should wait for results to confirm but they strongly felt it was malignant. He was going to rush the result for the next day and call me by 9 am. He said \"we just need to get thing thing taken care of.\" The next day he called and said that the results showed a b9 FA. I was overjoyed and relieved. I called my family and told the, the good news, we did some thankful praying. A few hours later my PCP called and said the radiologist called him becuase when he got the results he could believe them. He suggested I go to a surgeon for further review and a lumpectomy. My PCP agreed and I was scheduled for the next week. I had to go in a few days for more imaging on the opposite for \"developing asymmetry\" the tech was the same sweet lady. She explained to me that she hadn't sleep the whole night after my biopsy because she was so worried for me and relieved when the findings were b9. ( she was my same age with children the same age as well) The surgeon sent in her intern to go o er every thing. He too was convinced it was something more than the biopsy showed and went to get the doctor. I heard her \"teaching\" him in the hallway saying - look this is nothing she just needs to be told this and we can move. I was horified - she hadnt seen my films the looks on the radiologist face or any other info. She was making a snap judgement and showing off to her young intern. When she came in she went over everything I had read about FA (diagnosis from pathology). She then said there was nothing to worry about, it tested b9 therefore everything was fine. She said she was required to follow up in 6 months and would see me then. Let moe just say that the last 8 months have been awful. I had decided that I just wanted it out - the emotional tole was too much. When i went to see her last week her NP was the first to examine me. She was kind and pleasant and explained everything she saw on the sonogram. I saw that the tri-lobules mass had been replaced with at multi lobulated mass. She also remeasured it to be 2.5 cm x 2cm. She left me feeling confident that the doctor would want to remove it as well. When the doctor came in she was the same. Calis and cold women I remembered. She immediately went to an examination and started to tell me how it was 2.5 before and hasn't changed?!?!?!? She then said that there is no medical issue here. She began the sonogram herself and then abruptly stopped and sat in front of me. She explained that she understood I had\" dug my feet in the ground and want this out\" while I had only indicated that I wanted it out for my mental health to the NP I agreed with her that I did want it out. She then went into a lecture about how she has taken an oath to be good Stuart of the medical system and as such this performing this surgery would be a burden on an overtaxed and abused medical system. She asked if with the understanding that there was no medical basis for removal if I still wanted to move forward with removal. I stood my ground - I am meek so this was difficult for me - even my husband was to intimidated by her to say anything in my defense. She \"fine when do you want it scheduled?\" shrugging she suggested first available to which I agreed. When I left I was so horrified and questing of my own sanity that it didn't even stricken me until now that I maybe should not put my trust in her for the surgery. I know I have made the right decision to get it out and if only mentally it IS medically needed. But 1) what are the odds it could be more than b9 and 2) should I find another surgeon? I go in next week for a lumpectomy and new pathology. I cant help but worry. Does any have words to help me??? Log in to post a reply",
