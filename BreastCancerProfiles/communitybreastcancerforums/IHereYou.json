Cersonsky.  Fantastic center.  This is the only place in SouthWest Denver Metro that uses the breast board.  They have an (almost) brand new (under a year old) VARIAN State of the Art Radiology machine.  I swear it looks like it was built by NASA.   I almost did not have radiation as I had read so much about what can happen if a person  receives radiation laying  on the back. Especially if cancer is on left breast.  I have bilateral cancer- both breasts.  I saw three different radiology oncologists before I even found out that you could have radiation laying face down on a board that protects your lungs and heart.  Who knew?....   This is because supposedly the breast board is very expensive, so not many radiologists offer this method or even let you know it exists.  I do not know if the actual treatment costs more - just that the breast board used for the treatment is quite expensive. Sloan Kettering in New York has been using this method since 1998.  Also, a medical person told me that most facilities only update their radiology machines every 10 years.  Then they try to sell the used ones to third world countries. For them, it is much better than having no machine.  The machines themselves are very expensive, and this one is somewhere around $2 Million.  It looks it too.  I highly recommend that if there is not a facility in your area that does prone radiation, and especially if you have cancer in your left breast - then find a breast center somewhere else in the country that does offer it and find someone you can stay with there - or do whatever it takes to make it work so you can be treated in the prone position.   You must have pendulous breasts.  (Size D cup or larger). And no cancer in any of the nodes.  However I think I read they are working on ways to treat smaller breasts this way as well.   If you decide not to have radiation, and want to look at holistic or alternative cures -  look at a book on Amazon called \"Outsmart your cancer\".  Probably best to have radiation and also look at that book.   All of the other oncologists told me not to worry - technology is much better than it was 20 years ago, and women were not having heart and lung problems anywhere near what they used to.    Mastectomy is another option - which for many may mean - NO radiation - NO MRI's and Mamograms every year, etc.   Keep researching until you feel comfortable that you are making the right decision for YOU - the one you will be able to live with the best - for now.   Go to some stores and hold the prothesis in your hands.   The people at these places are /very/ nice and supportive.  I went to 3 stores when I thought I would be having a mastectomy....   An old boss once told me - \"Whenever you cannot make a decision - it is almost always a matter of  not having enough information...\"   I have found this to be true many times in my life since - including now.   Cancer is definitely a \"take one day at a time\"  kind of thing - and having information is key to staying sane - keep asking questions of everyone until you feel it settle inside.   If you have breasts \"that qualify\" - and want to be treated in prone position but would need to go to another part of the country - then create it.  Visualize it, pray - call that center and talk to several people there and see if they have any ideas.  Write it down, and see it happen.  Post on this board what you need to have happen.  Someone here may be able to help you!   Good luck and God's speed to all of us !",
