She has been having recurrent large pleural effusions on the right side. She was getting thoracentesis every 2 to 3 weeks for the past 3 months, but recently (3 weeks ago) opted to get a Pleurx catheter placed instead in hopes that her fluid will dry up soon. Just 2 weeks after the insertion, she started having fevers, chills, nausea, and vomiting. I took her to the ER and she was admitted. They found an infection in her pleural fluid and pneumonia. She's been getting treated for the infection but found that her pleura was becoming fibrous and we are unable to drain her completely. Certain solutions were injected into the catheter (tpA) and it broke up the fibrin but now she's getting bright red blood out of the catheter. After a couple more days, they decided to inject tpA again since she still had fibrous material blocking the drainage. She was drained again with more bloody output. The doctors were saying that if she continues to have blockage, the next option is surgery, but she is probably not a candidate for surgery. I'm just wondering if anyone else is having complications like my mom is with the pleural effusion and if so, what solution was there to fix the problem? She was doing decent before the pleurx insertion, essentially was asymptomatic even with large pleural effusions, able to go out and enjoy her life. Now, she has an infection and has been in the hospital for a week. She barely has enough energy to walk around now. I'm afraid the pleurx might have been a bad idea... I would greatly appreciate anyone with any input. I am feeling so lost and helpless right now. Wish I can make my mom go back to how she was before all these complications occurred.",
