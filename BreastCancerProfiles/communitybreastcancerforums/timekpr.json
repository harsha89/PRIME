While my last biopsy did turn up cancer (on a lump my boyfriend found) it was caught stage 1. My mother who has three first degree relatives with BC (her mother, her sister, and me) has never had anything other than benign biopsy results and she's almost 70.  You've done the most important thing - you went to the doctor, and are getting information.  A cancer diagnosis isn't the end of the world, and a benign result doesn't mean you can stop listening to your body and doing your self exams.  It's normal to worry! Let us know once you have the results,  ",

The area around my drain scars is still extremely sore and sensitive, and some nights the pain is bad enough to wake me up if I roll over to the bad side. I still have sharp pain in my armpit where the nodes were taken as well. Massaging the drain scars with oil (I'm using a grapeseed/vitamin E all natural blend) seems to help - it isn't comfortable to do, but my PT says breaking up that scar tissue will really make a difference and I do notice the pain is less a few hours later. I have a small degree (down from a serious degree w/PT) of lymphedema on the MX side as well, not in the arm but down my side over the ribs. If I had a BMX would not be obvious it is more obvious with me since I have the untouched side to compare with. I think that is part of what aggravates the pain around the drains - any kind of swelling makes it worse. I find that taking an anti-inflammatory (like Advil or Motrin) releives the pain better than the narcotics I was prescribed, so you may want to ask your BS if you can try that. ",

Take this time and read through the surgery and reconstruction threads here and make sure you've gotten answers to all your questions. Use this prep time to really get ready..do the laundry, clean out the closets, even start doing yoga and stretching. I know I wished in that first two weeks that I'd had time to organize my life and household a little better to create a healing environment.   In addition to getting a second surgical opinion, you may also want to see an Oncologist (if you haven't already)  - if they recommend additional tests you can start those now and have a solid follow up treatment plan ready before your surgery date. I'm sitting here a full month post MX still not knowing if I'll need chemo while we wait on BRAC and Oncotype tests.  Waiting is tough, but you may find that having a plan for this time will help it go faster.",
