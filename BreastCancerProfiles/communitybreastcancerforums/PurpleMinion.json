I was diagnosed with IBC less than a year ago and no treatments have worked. I have had a lot of progression over the last few months, including some internal lymph nodes and bones, many bones. Last week I had some MRIs to evaluate the bones better and as a result of those, this week I will be having MORE MRIs and a spinal tap because on one of the MRIs there is something they can't tell what it is, but see the title of this thread. I am aware that leptomeningeal disease is really bad and has a pretty poor prognosis. I am scared. Has anyone had a scare like this that turned out to be something else? Or, has anyone had LM and had any kind of longer term survival? I want to see my daughter graduate from high school in two years, and right now I am having a hard time believing that will happen. I am taking a \"board break\" mid June 2016, I will be back but mentally exhausted right now. Peace be with all of you. Diagnosed at 46 triple negative IBC. Mets to skin, lungs, bones.
