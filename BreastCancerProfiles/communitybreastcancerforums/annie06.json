Still trying to decide on a wig. Mostly I will not likely wear one (just around), but have some big family events (wedding) I need/want one for. Getting frustrated! This is my second time thru chemo...first tme 5 yrs ago AC DD. I didn't lose my eyelashes or eyebrows until my hair started coming back in which was a BLESSING to me! I am def eyelash dependent! I stenciled in (with brow powder) my eyebrows, and just used liner for my upper lid. Good news is that the brows AND lashes grow back super fast!!!! Down side is they all come out at once...so they all have the same 'birthday'...the shedding occurs frequently until they end up staggered with their 'birthdays'...can go on for months...never as bad as teh first time (I literally had ONE lash on on lid haha), but just FYI. What's up with thrush? When does it set in? I'm not sure what to expect. Have a stack full of papers to read up on. Plus I have things to do!!!! Kids to get places! Shopping to do for this wedding...like finding shoes to match my dress (hair or no hair...likely NO hair!)...!!!!! How about your nails? Are they hanging in OK? The only thing that really matters is that the chemo is effective and lowers my risk for recurrence/spread/ or new cancer. Second time around...time to kick it and kick it hard. And I have my prayer warriors on the front line!!!!!! God is keeping us! Blessings to you all!!!!!!",

I gargled with salt water last night and that helped...maybe use the Biotene? Other than that I am feeling well. I am so thankful! I am still trying to figure out the wig/hair thing...ugh. It'll be OK! I had my first TC on June 9th, so I am 5 days out. I have been keeping a fast paced schedule since chemo b/c I have four children and life is busy! I am thankful that I am feeling well enough to keep up with everything. I did take a nap yesterday after a date night with my hubby! He took the girls' out on errands/shopping so I could have quiet :-). I have had bone pain from Neulasta but motrin takes care of it. It's minimal. Other than that I am well. Thankful for this thread and we can do this together!!!!!! Thankful for ALL of you!!!!",

One surgery and they can remove those as well as the mast. and whatever you and your doctor decide. My results were neg. but I am still going to have the r. mast (prophylactic) with bilat recon. So my BRCA results have not changed a thing. The only thing is I now know my risk regarding the ovarian cancer risk...and have peace of mind regaring my kids too. I don't care what my risk is for a 'new' cancer on the opposite breast...I want LOW risk as possible. I too am young and have young children, two girls...go with what you feel good about.",

My concern too was the ovarian risk, as well as wanting a more dependable risk assessment regarding future breast cancer(s). I can check my paperwork...but I am guessing the reason they will test the other family members is to give you better clarity. If your dad tests positive, then that will give you insight into your own situation more likely. If neither of your parents carry the mutations, then you can't. If both your parents do carry them, you still may not have either of them. I am sure the GC went over all this with you...but that is my take on the 'variation of uncertain significance'. Testing other family members will perhaps answer some of that uncertainty that is present now. Am I making sense????",

May I say I was completely fine with my body post mastectomy...of course not doing back flips, but actually I had a choice between lumpectomy and mastectomy and I chose mastectomy. While I knew about recon options at the time of my decision, I opted to deal with the cancer first (meaning mastectomy and chemo) and later revisit the whole reconstruction issue. I had a prosthesis and I was glad noone could really tell my real breast from my breast form....I felt normal....however....I guess for me....I felt I needed to wear a bra and form for symmetry, it bothered me to be one sided, and I also have young children. They were totally OK with my physical appearance, glad I was in good health, but it was ME. My husband saw my mast. incision area immediately after surgery, he was fully supportive. I looked into all reconstruction options and the best choice for me was expanders and implants. I now have expanders and everything is great. I actually had a prophylactic mastectomy with bilat recon. and wow, I feel like a new person and my recon is not even fully done. I have not had any problems, minimal 'pain' (more like tightness), everything has gone so well and I am so happy with the results so far....and cannot believe how GOOD I feel now that I have what they call 'foobs'. I did not think it affected me that much, but I guess deep down it did. If everything with the recon failed tomorrow, I could happily live with bilat mast and breast forms.....but for me....I am happy to have the recon option. I am a young active mom and woman and wife, and for so many reasons I know the reconstruction is going to positively affect my life and lifestyle. I too really wanted to use my own tissue, and was not so thrilled with the implant option, but that was my best choice and I have had great results. Nothing can replace a real breast, and I understood that....but to an amazing degree I feel whole again and free.....did not realize how much it must have unknowingly affected me until after I started the whole recon process. I too would recommend at least consulting with some of the top PS docs who regularly perform breast reconstruction surgery of many types. A consult is not a commitment, but knowledge and info. Best of luck!",
