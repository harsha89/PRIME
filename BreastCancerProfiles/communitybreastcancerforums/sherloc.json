Acutally I think any needle biopsy is a waste of time but thats just me. If its not cancer great and it's gone and you don't need to ever think about it again. Lumpectomy/excisional biopsy is a very easy surgery. I would get it out.",

I was dx in 2004 and oncotype dx test wasn't available yet. My onc told me chemo would only lower my recurrence risk my 1-2%. Have you had oncotype test? That would help with your decision. For me I decided the risks of chemo outweighed the benefit and decided to leave it for the future if I ever face this decision again.",
