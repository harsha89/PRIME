Last I checked inflammation was a bad thing :/ Second mass is hyalinized fibroadenoma and fibroadenomatoid nodules. Any insight of those findings? Log in to post a reply",

He did another breast exam, got some look on his face, then referred me to radiology. He also asked if I had noticed the change in shape of my breats. I hadnt before but he was right. He didnt like how the previous techs did my images so we did more. They did my u/s, found the two lil guys again and immediately did a core needle biopsy on both. Then they placed the markers, I had the coil and the other kind. Mammo #2 and done. 30 min appt took 4 hours but fine by me! 7-10 for results. I have 0 anxiety and perfectly calm. Glad its over with!! Log in to post a reply",

Apparently theres some duct involvement beside one of the masses now? I don't know, she took more u/s pics of the ducts. And the dr noticed my breast was sitting different. The nipple on the \"bad side\" was very noticeably higher. Could still be benign right? Oh well, this too shall pass :) Hope everyone has a blessed day!",

Now that thought has been grounded and is guiding me toward an unknown destination. I am drinking some sleepy time tea and turned on Friends on netflix. When I lie down in a bit I will try the other relaxation technique. I suppose I'm not worried about the possible negative outcome and how it affects me personally, more worried about how I would juggle it with my boys. No family around, friends are all military and our schedules are time consuming. I guess I'm just borrowing trouble. I have created a world around me in which everything flows smooth and I am in control. I don't do well if something disturbs it bc I couldnt handle that world crumbling. Thank you for listening, I hate bothering people. But as was told to me tonight, \"Everyone has cancer cells in them\". It's hard talking to \"outside\" people. Thank you again",

I don't think it's cancer but something is going on, infection maybe?? I have some symptoms of pagets but that doesnt explain the indentation or the swollen axillary lymph nodes. It would if there were another underlying cancer with it. But two cancers in one breast and I've seen a breast surgeon and two radiologists already. If they didn't find anything else... This is why I think something else is going on. I know they try to go through as many channels here before an outside referral. They have to fly me or shuttle me to another state to see the breast surgeon. The radiologist last time sent me to one, and he was the one that realized my breasts and nipples were lopsided. Wish this was just cut and dry. If I'm not mistaken, an MRI sees everything correct? I have heterogenously to extremely dense breasts so I think that might be a more viable option. Can I request one?",

If someone could tell me that yes, these are symtoms of fibroadenomas then ok, everything is great. I didn't get seen originally for a lump. My pa just haplened to find one. My symptoms originally were stabbing and burning pain towards nipple, clear discharge, and redness that did go away. Procedure..procedure..procedure..fibroadenomas. Now I have brown discharge, tenderness and swelling on outside of armpit (same side of issues), and indentation two inches long vertically to the outside of my nipple. Oh and my nipple and areola has been soooo tender and sore. At times it turns pink/red. Are these signs of fibroadenomas? Feel like I'm losing my mind. I suppose stress can cause some aches and pains but I can physically see the swelling in the armpit and this long line like a ridge going down my breast. Oh and one nipple is sitting higher than the other. My pa is sending me to a gyno as she is clueless, her words. Help :( Log in to post a reply",

I've actually started writing everything down basically on a timeline bc I can't even keep track. I won't bore you with the list of symptoms I have had previously and the testing. But to add to what I had going on before, my breast turns red on the bottom today, died down to a very soft pink now due to hydrocortisone creme, and I can't lay my left arm down comfortably due to the swollen lymph nodes. As I was just laying down on my right side I had an aching pain going down my left arm. I am trying my HARDEST to ignore these symptoms and it works for awhile, until something new pops up randomly. And for some crazy reason unbeknownst to me, the lymph nodes in my neck on the right side are bulging out. I'm done. Oh and crazy red dots appeared out of the blue underneath the areola. Waiting for an appt to see a gyno in texas. Does anyone else see this madness?? If you made it this far then thank you. I've been having issues with this breast since early January now. Just tired.",

      "Content": "soldieron wrote: Hello ladies. I was on here almost a year ago with breast issues, turns out I had a couple fibroadenomas, no biggie. Periodically since then, no relevance to cycle, I've still had intermittent discomfort with same breast. It's been near biopsy site. Now for hours the discomfort has increased on the pain scale and when I tried to massage the area hoping it would go away, for the first time I noticed the area of sensitivity. Did a quick CBE, and it's not a lump per se, more like an area that feels different. But after pressing on it, the pain shoots to the nipple. It's not at the biopsy site exactly but near it. It's more on the outside about an inch, not in the path of a would-be scar tissue. I am currently in Iraq now and can not foresee me going to get it checked out til I get home, (pride thing when you work with a bunch of male soldiers), probably in the next couple to few months. Is this normal for approx 9 month post biopsy still? Just trying to alleviate some concern. Thanks in advance ladies. Log in to post a reply",

Glimpsed reports (again) and for some reason the radiologist requested a surgical biopsy. Didnt pick up on that before. Why isnt just a needle biopsy sufficient if this is nothing? Why is there a circular bruise on my breast all of a sudden? Why has my breast had shooting pains all day? I'm sick with stress, been handling everything pretty well prior to today. I'm half-tempted to not go tomorrow and let whatever it is play out. If its nothing it'll go away on its own. Please just some reassurance I'm not being an idiot or weak. Log in to post a reply",
