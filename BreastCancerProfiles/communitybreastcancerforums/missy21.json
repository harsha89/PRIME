      "Content": "missy21 wrote: I just turned 39. I am followed very closely at a breast center (yearly) with mammograms and MRI's because of my family history.  My sister was diagnosed with DCIS at 38, she chose a double mastectomy. My mother was diagnosed in her early 50's with DCIS (lumpectomy was only treatment she wanted) and then 6 month follow up mammo showed possible spreading of cancer.  Hard to explain but she chose no treatment and passed away 4 years later from mets to liver.   I also have an aunt on my fathers side that had breast cancer and she needed a mastectomy. No further info on her, but she is doing well. Now me:  I noticed some uncomfortableness (is that a word??) under my left armpit for the past couple of weeks.  Tonight I felt a mobile lump, about the size of an almond on the bottom half of my armpit.  It's not painful.  It feels pretty smooth.  I don't have my yearly visit with the breast center until next month.  Is this typical of cancer?  Fibroadenoma?  I have had several biopsies, all fibroadenomas.  Can cancer resemble a fibroadenoma?  Any info would be greatly appreciated.  Log in to post a reply",
