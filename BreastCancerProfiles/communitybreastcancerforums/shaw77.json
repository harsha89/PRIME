My skin started to be uncomfortable last weekend, but it's not more than that. I have worked almost full time without a problem. I am definitely tired at night, but it's also stressful adding in the hour/plus that the rad tx takes out of my day. can only say what everyone else does: everyone is different. It also matters if you're coming out of chemo or not - I am not, and I think that may make rad a little easier. Â good luck!",
