I've never been a big meat eater but i love seafood. Nutritionist just tells you to have a more plant based diet. You hear from this and that person that you shouldn't eat this and that. It just got to the point where I'm like ok so what's there left to eat then? Just curious to know how you ladies changed your diet? It's hard and confusing when you read one place that this food is good but then read somewhere else that's it's not. Help me pls!
