I just had my biopsy done today and now the area is bleeding a little and its a little pain but I can't sleep due to the fact that I'm so very worried. My dr performed a needle biopsy with sonogram to guide him and the first thing he said was that it definitely isn't fat and it is a mass. I have no idea what a mass really means . I just pray that whatever it is its benign. Im a single mom with a 6 year old son and all I keep thinking about is him",
