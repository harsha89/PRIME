Recently my mother has found out she has to have treatment for a lump the doctors found, and frankly I am worried sick even though my mom is doing everything healthy already. Cancer runs in the family, but my mom eats and works out better than most people half her age. Anyway here is the first frustrating online contradiction: One video had a doctor saying soy could trigger more growth of breast cancer, yet when looking up diets I noticed an article saying soy was GOOD for preventing breast cancer. Well, somebody is extremely wrong or vague or both. With something this serious, concerning my mom (I would defend her with my life), they should get their facts straight. Do they mean fermented or non-fermented soy? Does the diet change with prevention vs. post diagnosis? What is right? What food is good for my mom?!!!!!!!! Log in to post a reply",
