What a blessing from God. I underwent a double mastectomy on November 19, 2008. No cancer were found in my lymph nodes. What a wonderful surgeon I had. Not to mention that he believes in God which is a huge part of my recovery. I have a profound faith in God and his healing powers.I am undergoing three rounds of chemo. One round of TC every 21 days. Of course there is the 10 day blood count to make sure my immune system stays in good standing. Each time thus far , my immune system has been completely wiped out, but i have not suffered any illnesses. Again, the work of God. I have already completed 3 and have only one more to go. I feel so blessed as I'm sure we all do. Has anyone gone through what I've gone through and come out feeling pretty good. I mean no sickness or throwing up, etc.? I just feel so blessed and want to know that others feel blessed as well. Please let me know your thoughts. I've had so much family  friends helping out. I hope you all do too. I will pray for us all. God really does hear us and answer our prayers. I have two young girls who I love so dearly and a husband that has been the best friend a person could ever want. i want to be around for a long time. I hope this is is God's will; because it is my will if he sees fit. Thank you for listening. I hope to hear from you soon. --Judy",
