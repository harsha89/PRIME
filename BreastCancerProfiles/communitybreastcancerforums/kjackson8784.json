    "Content": "kjackson8784 wrote: It all started over a year ago when all my lymph nodes became swollen. Shortly after I started having a clear discharge out of my right nipple. I have had a partial hysterectomy and have only my right ovary. My mammogram came back and they told me I had very dense tissue but they couldn't find anything. Over the last year I have lost 65 lbs not trying and without explanation. Within the last month when I lay on my stomach it feels like there is something really sharp stabbing me behind my left nipple with heaviness in left breast. Along with both breast leaking fluid, enough I have to wear nursing pads. Now within the last week my right breast near my armpit has started getting a kinda achy feeling. I am going back to the breast dr but not for a month.. Should I be concerned and push for a sooner appointment?? Log in to post a reply",
