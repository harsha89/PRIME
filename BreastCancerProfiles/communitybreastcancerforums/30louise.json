He refered me to an Oncologist, but I still have not heard from them. (Despite leaving messages)  I am told I will be having chemo, then radiation.  I feel anxious to start my treatments. With Christmas coming, I am not even sure I will see the Oncologist before January.   Anyone know if there is a window to start chemo when it is most useful? ",
