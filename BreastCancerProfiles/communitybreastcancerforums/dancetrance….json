You should be up and about pretty quickly. The lipo is more painful than the breast injections. Most only need to take about 4 or 5 days of recovery before going back to work. That said, you will still be sore from lipo for several weeks, but in general it does not limit most people significantly. My radiated side is rock hard. It has taken 4 months for the fat graft to start softening things (my 3rd procedure was July 2013). I am still pink in areas and hard - it is still healing. But it is healing, and softening! Getting there. Still need one maybe two more procedures to get my radiated side matching my nonrads side.",

I also recommend you read this article: Postmastectomy Radiotherapy: Clinical Practice Guidelines of the American Society of Clinical Oncology*  Here's part of what they say in the discussion:  The Panel found that the weight of the evidence from randomized trials was sufficient to recommend the routine use of PMRT for patients with four or more positive axillary lymph nodes. It is much less certain that the benefits of PMRT are sufficient to justify its use in most patients with T1/2 tumors with one to three positive nodes. The available evidence is insufficient to make recommendations for this subgroup. Further randomized trials (such as a recently opened intergroup trial in North America) are justifiable for this subgroup of patients. There are few data from randomized trials for patients with T3 or locally advanced (stage III) operable cancers, but the evidence from retrospective studies is sufficient for the Panel to suggest that PMRT be routinely used for such patients. While the consensus of the Panel was to suggest the use of PMRT for most patients treated with neoadjuvant systemic therapy, the Panel could not find sufficient evidence to determine whether all patients should be irradiated after neoadjuvant systemic therapy.  These guidelines were issued in 2001, and I don't think a new set has been published, so you will want to check the NCCN guidelines to see if anything else new has been recommended.    MLB, I agree with TonLee.  You have had a MX, had clear margins, and are node negative.  I have not seen anywhere where rads is indicated in that case...I'd ask your RO for the data/research to show that it is indicated.  Perhaps there is something new I haven't seen. ",

TonLee, I just did a pub med search and found this article on hypothyroidism and radiation for breast cancer: Dose distribution in the thyroid gland following radiation therapy of breast cancer-a retrospective study  Looks like it happens primarily with women who have supraclavicular radiation and also who have smaller thyroids to begin with.  It appears that with supraclavicular rads part of the thyroid is radiated. Some selected snippets from the article: The association between RT and hypothyroidism in breast cancer (BC) patients has been investigated in only a few studies [12-16]. On the other hand, radiation exposure to parts of the thyroid gland seems unavoidable in BC patients receiving RT to the ipsilateral supraclavicular fossa. Joensuu et al. [12] demonstrated that 17 of 80 patients (21%) had developed thyroid hypofunction 7 years after postoperative loco-regional RT for BC. Bruning et al. [13] concluded that hypothyroidism was significantly more frequent in BC patients who had received irradiation to the supraclavicular lymph nodes compared to non-irradiated BC patients.   .................. We concluded that patients with small thyroid glands are at particular risk to develop hypothyroidism after radiotherapy for breast cancer, as less tissue with radiation doses less than 30 Gy is available for sufficient thyroxin production. Further investigations in larger cohorts are required to confirm our results. ",

My shoulder motion as a result is significantly improved. I am a huge proponent of fat grafting to help restore radiated tissue. That said...fat grafting only is a LONG process. It requires multiple surgeries. I have had 4 and still need 2 more and likely will only get to a B cup. I have been at this for several years. But I know you are considering fat grafting WITH implants. Some have done successive fat grafting then implants after radiation with success. Hopefully your radiation damage is not as severe as mine, and you can go that route. I hope those who have gone that route will speak up and share their story! The risk of capsular contracture with implants after radiation is very high, but some have done it. You are smart to research this carefully and weigh all of your options.

She left the nipple recon open (no stitches on the top flap) because she said radiated skin does not heal well, and if she closely it completely there would be a greater chance of swelling and it possibly necrosing and dying. So, it took longer to heal. She sewed a plastic ring into my skin around the nipple. I had to do a daily dressing change where I packed a special dressing carefully all around the edges of the ring (and underneath) and then on top of the nipple in the center, then covered it with a tegaderm. This was after carefully irrigating the wound with sterile saline spray. I forget how long I had the plastic ring sewed into my skin. Maybe 6 weeks? And the nipple care continued after that for a while, too. It worked, though! I had some shrinkage and flattening, BUT, she had made it larger than the other side to account for that. For a detailed description of the process, I did document my whole story on fatgraftpatients.com. My memory is fading, so reading there will be more accurate. It's a long story chronicled over the 5 years I had multiple surgeries to completely reconstruct my breasts from fat. If you go to around April 2016, that is when I had my last surgery with nipple recon - start reading from there. http://www.fatgraftpatients.com/forums/viewtopic.p...",

I have had a total of 4 fat grafting surgeries, 2 before and 2 after rads. My most recent one was just over a week ago. I am doing total fat grafting with Brava, no implants. On this last one she did a mini-RAFT (pull some healthy abdominal skin up to the lower pole of the breast) with a fold recreation (I lost my fold at time of MX - it happens fairly often). Doing well. Rough go of it at first and the fold gave me some sharp pain one day, but no major symptoms now. Just soreness.",

It became MUCH softer (it was like a rock, almost) and my shoulder range of motion also returned to nearly normal. The radiated tissue still of course isn't 100% normal, but it is significantly better. I had severe radiation fibrosis and even had to take pentoxifyillen for over 1.5 years to try to bring more blood flow to the area. I had 4 fat grafts post radiation. Don't expect a huge difference in volume with each graft. It takes multiple surgeries, IMO - but I guess that depends on what your goal is. I also used Brava domes to enhance circulation...not fun...and not for everyone. Note - I do not have implants. Definitely do NOT do nipple recon unless you have had multiple fat grafts first. The tissue does not heal the same. Even after 4 fat grafts after radiation, my nipple recon took months to heal, and that was with careful DAILY dressing changes. It did turn out quite successful, but I had a very skilled surgeon and I also was very dedicated to careful daily wound care for a few months.",

All they have to do is an ultrasound - it can usually easily be seen that it is benign that way. FYI, I found most of my episodes of small lumps after fat grafting presented about 6 months post the grafting. After about a year just about all of them have gone away. Most seasoned radiologists by this time are familiar with fat grafting and reading mammo's. It's way better than a few years ago, in my experience, since fat grafting is becoming more common. However, there are still some radiologists that are old school and do not have as much experience reading mammo's after fat grafting. ",

Not sure if the full article would help or not, but it caught my eye as it seems to be addressing the topic and may help you as you process your decision.  ???    The oligometastatic state in breast cancer: hypothesis or reality.  Abstract The term 'oligometastasis' was initially used to describe a restricted locoregional tumour load, but the term has now become synonymous with isolated distant metastases. The existence of an oligometastatic state is still not widely recognised in the management of breast cancer patients. However, there are a number of patients who do develop isolated metastases and in whom long term survival can be achieved following appropriately targeted treatment. This review article discusses the possible biological mechanisms behind the development of an oligometastatic state and the findings from different trials which describe results following radical therapy for isolated metastatic disease. Although no large scale trials in this area have yet been undertaken, there is evidence to support the existence of an oligometastatic state in patients with breast cancer and we discuss the appropriate management for this clinical scenario.    ",

Patients with margins of 2 mm or less who have any additional unfavorable features such as having high-grade disease, comedonecrosis or being under the age of 60 are at particular risk of local recurrence and might benefit from radiotherapy after mastectomy. However, additional research is needed to confirm these findings. It is thought that half of local recurrences will be additional DCIS and half invasive cancers, this belief by other long term studies of breast cancer. However, in this small sample, looking at these special parameters, all the cases of local recurrence were invasive. This makes the recurrence more dangerous. www.cancerfacts.com/home_study...   Now, I don't know what the research shows regarding IDC and MX and radiation.  Hopefully someone else will have something to share on that.   ",

In summarizing a 2005 Australian study published in the \"British Journal of Medicine,\" the American Institute for Cancer Research reported women who drank an average of three drinks a day and consumed 200 micrograms of folate or less had double the risk for breast cancer than those women who did not drink alcohol. Conversely, when folate intake was increased to 400 micrograms, the participants had an equal risk of developing the disease as their nondrinking counterparts. In other words, a higher folate intake seems to mitigate the effects of excess alcohol consumption in terms of breast cancer risk. Warning Beth Szuck, a registered dietitian with Winnipeg Regional Health Authority's Breast Health Center, urges women to try to meet nutritional requirements through diet because, \"in some cases, it's been reported that folic acid can actually accelerate the cancer problem.\" The American Institute for Cancer Research calls it the folate paradox. On the one hand, folate helps DNA replicate normally. But if there are cancer cells present in the body growing at a faster rate than healthy cells, they also need folate to multiply. Taking a supplement in this case could accelerate cancer cells. Therefore, if you're thinking about taking folic acid, you should first consult with your doctor. The research on the effectiveness of folic acid in cancer prevention is ongoing. The results have been mixed.
