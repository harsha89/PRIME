Actually, I have read hours of post since my diagnosis on 12/22/08. I have DCIS Grade 1 ER+/PR+ in my left breast. I am choosing for them to take my right one also because I do NOT want to have to worry forever. I can get new perkier \"foobs\", but I can't get a new life on this earth!!!  Hope everything goes well for all, Kathy",

My surgery was the 10th and I just wanted to let everyone that is preparing for surgery  know that the worry is 10 times worse than the actual procedure. I had a private room and my DH stayed with me the entire time. I stayed two nights and had the best care possible. I had some minor pain that was controlled with morphine,demerol shots or pills. ( I was given a choice) I didn't look until I came home and I thought my new foobs were beautiful. Since I had skin-sparing my PS could actually fill more from the start. He filled 250cc on both sides. I had cleavage, firmness with no sagging!!!! Well, today is the 19th and things are changing. I wished I had not looked. I have developed blisters on my right breast and also an infection. Two of the large blisters have busted and now I'm seaping so much we are changing clothes about 3 times a day. My sister is a nurse and she came back over today to check me out. She thinks I am also flattening out like a pancake and getting droopier. Does anyone know if this is just a process we go through? I am going back to the doctor tomorrow. He is two hours away or I would have already gone back. We went last Monday and the nurse(whom I must say was rough as h???) took out all my drains. I was more sore for two days after she poked on me than after the actual procedure. I'm also having trouble with bras. I can't find ANYTHING that fits. Any suggestions??? I hope all is going well for the others that have just gone through this, also. My reports did come back CANCER FREE, so I keep telling myself be proud and the reconstruction will work out. It is just a long process. You girls are wonderful, Hugs to all, Kathy W.",

Since my diagnosis, the women here have helped me maintain my sanity. They have provided me with a wealth of knowledge along with many words of encouragment. They are a tremendous support group.
