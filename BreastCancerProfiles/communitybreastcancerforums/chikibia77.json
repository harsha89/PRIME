My Mom is getting all her information from reading and not really talking to people that have been through it. I just want her to make an informed decision. My Grandma and (an) Auntie actually passed away after receiving treatments so she kind of feels like whats the use. I Know that it is her decision to make, and I am behind her whichever way she decides to go. This is very hard for me because I feel like she is just giving up.",
