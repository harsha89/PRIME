I am very sorry you\u2019re in a similar boat but, like you said, all we can do is make the best, most informed decision with the information we currently have available. I also have three little kids (5 and under), and wanting to increase my odds of being here for them longterm is why I have been and am leaning mostly towards a bilateral. Dense breasts are also a complicating factor regarding accurate screening going forward and, like you, the genetic counselor said I was at higher risk and should get tested every couple years as new markers are identified. There\u2019s so much to consider. Wishing you well and wishing you peace of mind with whatever you decide.",

      "Content": "Megsed wrote: Hi everyone. Looking for some advice from anyone who has been in a similar situation. I am 35 years old and just finished a round of neoadjuvant chemo for stage 3a. My surgery needs to be within the next 30 days and I'm trying to weigh my options. My breast surgeon, who is one of the best in the nation, is supportive of either surgery but is also noncommittal. He said to do whatever will give me greater peace of mind. Currently I'm not sure what that is. I was negative for the genetic markers they tested for. A little background: mymom and younger sister (33) do not have breast cancer (at least not yet- they're both young), but 6 out of 9 siblings on my dad's side have or had either prostate or breast cancer, including my dad (2/3 men, 4/6 women). My aunts were all under 45 at diagnosis and one aunt passed away at 42 after being diagnosed at 35 like me. One of the aunts who has been diagnosed is only 45 and has an identical twin who is currently unaffected. So far all of my cousins are fine, but we are all young (mostly 30s and 20s). I know you all are not genetic counselors. But if you also have a heavy family history of breast cancer, what did you do and do you regret it? I'd love to keep my unaffected breast obviously but am scared I might have a genetic mutation that is yet to be discovered. If I truly have no genetic marker, my BS said my risk of developing a new breast cancer in my unaffected breast with no surgery is 8% at 20 years and will drop thereafter. TIA for any feedback/guidance. Log in to post a reply",
