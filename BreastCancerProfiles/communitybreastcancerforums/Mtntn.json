      "Content": "Mtntn wrote: Hi everyone! Would love to get someone's thoughts. I'm 38, no kids and recently found an indent on the lower outer quadrant of my left breast when I raise my arm. Its only obvious when I raise my arm. I went to my doc who could see it too. I had an urgent referral to breast clinic where I got an ultrasound and mammogram. Both were clear. The consultant then said that they see this type of presentation from time to time, tethering, dent, no lump so he is referring me for an MRI. Anyone else get a diagnosis after having a clear mammogram and ultrasound? Just not sure what would cause the indent if there was nothing there? Thanks for all your thoughts in advance.

I called radiology so they said I should get an MRI within six weeks.... long six weeks :) Its all so odd, as presuming its all clear, how suddenly this noticeable dimpling area just shows up. I need some type of answer either way so will be delighted to get the MRI done and behind me. Thanks so much! Sarah",
