Pretty disgusting, but...I'm sure they didn't TRY to hit a blood vessel. As a matter of fact, I heard them talking with regret about how I was already bleeding while they were doing the biopsy, and it sounded pretty unusual in their minds. Oh well. Two days post, I hardly feel it, although it looks absolutely terrible. I would suggest you be diligent with the ice paks and with keeping whatever compression you are using. They put a wide ACE bandage on me before I left the imaging center, and I kept it on (obviously redoing it when needed) for 48 hours. I confess, I get claustrophobic, so I needed Xanax because of the MRI. Sadly, it leaves me feeling drugged for a couple of days afterwards. Good luck!",

But over the last two days, the site where the needle entered has gotten sore and there is a hard lump around it. Anyone have this? It is definitely sore if I press it, but it also is sore enough to get my attention when I'm not touching it at all, just moving in a normal way or even simply sitting around. I don't know if I should go back to using ice -- or maybe heat? Massage it, don't touch it? It isn't particularly hot or red, just sore and lumpy. I'll probably call the doctor tomorrow, but wondered if anyone else has had this.",
