I have been dealing with a very itchy and sore nipple off and on for several months and haven't really given it much thought. I'm 48 and so many hormonal changes occur at this age I blamed that. This past round was 2 weeks of sore and itchy so I made a doctor appointment to find out how to relieve it. I ended up with a small amount of bleeding (drops only) and a small scab which came off just before my appointment. I have no lumps, no scaling or any of that. I have had sticky straw colored spots inside my bra at times which I thought weird but has been at random times and never days in a row so I dismissed it. Doctor noticed a small dimple on the nipple and consulted with another doctor. I'm off to have diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound in 2 weeks to rule out bc and/or Paget's. If both negative then a biopsy. I'm kind of concerned why in that order if they want a biopsy in the end. Do they actually suspect cancer and want to confirm vs rule out? I'm probably over thinking it :) This is taking me by surprise as I was just looking for hormonal balance! And now of course I am looking at \"the girls\" with new suspicion and that breast does look a bit lopsided on one side of the nipple when I'm laying down. I'm just posting here as an outlet. I'm a little scared but also believe that worst case is still a positive outcome for me as it seems early if it is in fact Paget's. Hubby doesn't seem to want to discuss it unless we have results. Sounds rude of him but I think is denial as both his parents died young from other cancers.",

I had no symptoms when I was there and she believes probably papilloma but wants to see how it presents. I will call her when symptoms return so she can examine me then and go from there. Whatever it is seems early stages so I'm okay with this plan but will be persistent until I know something for certain.",

Recommended follow up biopsy with GP or breast program at cancer center to rule out PD for sure. Feeling relieved but not celebrating yet. :)",
