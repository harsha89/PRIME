Everyone seems really supportive and informative, so I'm hoping someone might have some ideas. For the last couple of months I've been feeling insanely exhausted, no appetite, a few fevers here and there. I started noticing some chest discomfort a month ago, and felt a few lumps under my collar bone and above my left breast. About 6 months ago my right breast had swollen to three times the size with slight discharge , but everything checked out okay. I finally made an appointment to get the left lump area checked out since they weren't going away. One feels solid and unmovable. The other a funky shape, but movable. There's a slight pain around them, but not the lumps directly. The doctor felt around for about two minutes today and instantly became worried. She found more masses, one under my armpit as well. She kept saying here's something, and what's this. This doesn't feel good. And the lymph nodes are swollen all around the lumps. She suddenly said we're done you need tests right away. She sent me to the lab and for a chest X-ray. I have a mammogram and ultrasound in the morning. She said you need to know I'm checking for cancer, but that was it. Now I'm slightly freaking out. I don't know what to expect or what questions I should be asking. I know she's done a CBC, and wrote left breast ttp after my X-ray, but no Call to explain. Any ideas lovely people?

The guy doing he imaging said the lymph node was slightly large, and looked slightly odd, but that it was fine because I'm only 27 and they didn't notice any thing in The left part of my breast that they looked at. Kind of dismissive, but maybe I'm overreacting",

I'm sorry that you have both had those experiences. I talked to the radiologist after my ultrasound. He said that they can feel where the tissue is very hard and fixed in my breast , but he didn't have an conclusive answer from the ultrasound. He only noted that he knows it's not from a cyst, abscess, or something of that nature. I'm hoping that they will do an MRI now. I see the doctor again on Friday, so I suppose we will see what she says.",

What made me go in was no appetitie and extreme exhaustion for over a month. And then when feeling my chest one night I noticed what i perceived as hard lumps. Maybe 1/3 the size of my pinky.

      "Content": "Mar 5, 2018 02:38PM - edited Mar 5, 2018 04:20PM by Katiec326 so the physicians assistant I saw today said that I have thickening in my right breast. She didn't expand on this, but my understanding from google is that majority of the time that is nothing to be concerned about. She felt the left and felt one of the lumps I mentioned and said it's probably a lymph node. I asked her about my enlarged lymph nodes. She blatantly refused to examine any of them and said I probably just have bigger lymph nodes then other people. Then she literally ignored my other questions and concerns and said well you are 27 so its probably hormones. She did schedule an ultrasound for my right breast. It's frustrating because I feel like the couple times I have been seen for this, I have been totally disregarded mostly because of my age. I understand how it is most likely not breast cancer, and that it could be many other things. I'm just nervous because everything has just been getting worse with my breasts, and I feel like no one takes me seriously or bothers to answer my questions. If they were to say we know it's not this because of a,b,c etc. I would feel a lot better. Not just well, we're not sure, but you're only 27 so it's probably fine. Unless I'm being ridiculous, which is definitely possible since I do feel anxious. I just haven't felt right for awhile now. I'd like to have the energy again to get through my day, a normal appetite, and breasts that don't keep changing in ways that make me nervous and leave me constantly uncomfortable. I also feel weird about how they were nervous about my lymph nodes for one moment, and now have totally disregarded them even though they said that they shouldn't be swollen from a sickness so long ago, and there's no sign of infection, negative for mono etc. I'm hoping the ultrasound on the right tomorrow has some explanation, hopefully a very simple one, for all of the issues I've been having. But I should be glad that nothing has jumped out so far that was definitely bad.",
