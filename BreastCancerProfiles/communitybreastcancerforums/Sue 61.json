My husband had part A only and it picked up nothing. The only time having Medicare A and B came in handy (per my experience as a casemanager) was IF the member's plan covered only 60 day, eg, in a skilled nursing facility and the member met medicare criteria to stay, then the facility could bill medicare for additional days.  As far as I know, Medicare does not pick up deductibles and copays. At least it never did it for my husband! The drawback to not taking Part B right now (and they deduct this from your social sec check) is that when you do need it, it will cost more. You should talk to spouse's human resource dept to make sure his ins is prime.",

Are you on COBRA? I noted that you said that you are unemployed at this time. If you are on COBRA, your rates should stay the same. Or are you paying privately for a catastrophic plan? Most of the high deductible plans are of the catastophic variety. Keep in mind that each state has a division of insurance.........should you have any questions or concerns, you can always call the DOI. I took an early retirement from my company and am absolutely appalled at what they are charging me for retiree insurance. ($723/MO) It's much higher than it was supposed to be and I got that little notice that said \"due to high use by the retirees, our rates are increasing.\" Mine increased almost $175 per month, and I have a 2K deductible. Like I said, I feel your pain. Yes, you can get treatment and self pay, but if you have that deductible. I would start to use it. Unless you can get a good deal and negotiate a lower rate for any testing. Feel free to PM me at any time.  Sue",

Through my health insurance policy, I can compare costs on certain tests and procedures. I had the initial biopsy done at a local big medical center but opted for treatment at Dana Farber in Boston, MA. The cost of MRI locally was about $1000.........I believe it was $4K or above in Boston.  Boston was far superior to the local place. As a matter of fact, the local hospital shipped all the biopsy slides down to Boston and I had to pay for the re reading of them. They were improperly packed and were \"unreadable.\" I just loved paying for nothing! I think you might find a financial counselor at the Cancer Center who can sit down with you and discuss any ways to take out a payment plan or find ways to lessen the costs. They may have funding available that they can access. Hopefully. I will add that I am glad I had the MRI as a \"cyst\" that was diagnosed locally turned out to be another small IDC in the other breast. And yes, MRIs do show a lot of things that turn out to be nothing, but I cannot tell you how happy I was to have one.  Sue",

I don't mean to be a \"downer\", but I am 62 , altho very immature for my age (or so my dtrs tell me) and am not SO  upset about all of this crap. I have been relatively healthy all my life, even tho I did not take the best care of myself. Love  TWINKIES and junk like that, meat, ham (love salt), despise all fruit except watermelon in the summer, smoked, you name it, I am one big candidate for this. And I have a BELLY, but attribute that to having twins. Yea, like 36 yrs ago. Would chose a couple sausages in the A M over a pear or some other fruit. But do love veggies. I was never sick one day in my life since I cared for my husband. Not ONE day! Stayed thin due to all the lifting I had to do (cardiac disease ...heart attack at age 46 when I was only 44....with eventual....hate to say this....bilateral amputation of both lower extremities due to severe vascular disease.......gosh, that really sucked), stress from the job as a nurse casemanager, just the general stuff. I often apologize to my 3 dtrs for passing on that BAD protoplasm, as one of my medical directors used to call it.  Cardiac and cancer. The gift that keeps on giving.  My girls all have really healthy life styles and I hope that somehow protects them. They are gym nuts. One even ran in the Boston marathon, while I get tired just driving 26 miles.  I am thinking of you all, young and old, and so glad to meet you here, but HATE the circumstances.  Just my thought for the day.

(just kidding) I am retired nurse casemanager for nation wide ins co. The squeaky wheel usually gets the grease. Did they offer you an appeal re the femara denial? I know Arimidex is  outrageous in price. If you are doing well on Femara, write a lette to either your insuror or the appeals dept.  or have your doc intervene. (Perhaps your doc can call and discuss with either the pharmacy dept or the medical director as to why you need this med. If it is working for you this is nonsense. Arimidex is ten bucks a pill. But like I said, I have no clue as to the cost of Femara. Is there a website for your ins co? I can go in and request a cost quote on mine.......not sure if you can do the same. You also need to check pharnacy benefits. How long have u been on this med and what the heck is the deal now. You are doing well on it and it is disgusting to me if this is some kind of cost savings measure. Ceo's make big bucks and like to screw the members. And I am sure your doc has the time to spend on the phone with such nonsense.  Of course my always BEST advice is to call your insurance company and request a casemanager. I was only allowed to casemanage people who needed  a lot of education re their disease. I did cardiac and know nada about breast cancer. The very first thing I did when I got the dx was to request a cm and she was so very helpful, I cannot even begin to tell you! told em i was really dumb about cancer. (say whatever it is you have to say to get some intervention from your insuror)And most casemanagers are nurses. And most nurses woud give you the shirts off their backs to help their members. I know I would. (got in trouble sometimes but slept well at night) As far as I can say about aches and pains.......sheesh, I am 62 and different parts of my body seem to attack me for no particular reason. I am appalled at these insurance companies who take your money and then take their members over the coals. That's why I retired last yr. Was SO SICK of having to deny something for some bogus reason.  Let me know if ths info has helped u......you can also check the femara web to see if they wil help u out on the cost...........take care, Sue",

WELL, the docs at Dana Farber (Boston, MA) were shocked that, after bx via MRI , the cyst was another small cancer, confirmed after MRI, which I had my local doc order. I really thought it was the standard of care. So maybe we should push for further investigative non invasive tests like MRI. Really.  I feel that many insurance companies who are in the \"business of caring\" and really in the \"business of making money\" are going to be delighted about what they can deny to men and women who need mammos at the appropriate age. I never felt a lump nor did my docs. I have IDC. I feel we should push for mammos and then good testing.  OH, and no, the docs there were not happy campers with these new guidelines.

I was married for 36 yrs (my husband is now deceased) and when people asked him how long we were married, he would always say \"two happy years, but 36 in all.\" He thought he was so darn funny. Actually, he was! LAURA, such a hard decision you have to make. I was 60 when dx. I knew I had a small IDC in one breast and the MRI showed that the \"cyst\" in the other breast was also IDC. The doc did talk to me about bilateral lumpectomies but I opted for mastectomies. I was a widow at the time but did discuss my options with my adult girls and they agreed with me. GET IT OUT is all I could think of. The final pathology showed another area of DCIS in one breast so  I made the best decision for ME. When I was first diagnosed and was discussing options with a nurse buddy, she asked me if I felt my body \"defined\" me. I said NOPE.  I had a couple of sisters in law who were appalled at my decision, but I never regretted it. Of course I am older than you but you will finally figure out what is best for you. Again, such a hard decision. I wish you well, Sue ",

So I adopted a dog from a shelter and she was reallly really not too bright but a loving girl. I had her for 8 yrs (she was 4 when  I got her....someone turned her and her litter into a shelter 2 wks before Christmas so I just had to go get her outta there); My only concern is that I would like a smaller dog this time. The New England winters can be horrid and I used to have to shovel out part of my back yard as the snow would drift so high that sometimes I had trouble opening the storm door to let the dog out to poop. OH, and the spring clean up would yield about 100 lbs of poop. You can't scoop in MA until the thaw.  I have seen mini long haired dachshunds that look like little golden retrievers but I am afraid to lose one in the snow drifts. But boy do I hate living alone...........even a dumb dog would be good company, right???? Sue",

Now I am being treated at Dana Farber and kind of know my way around, but if there is a DETOUR......ouch, I get in a panic.  Thank goodness for that big CITGO sign over Fenway.....If I get going and hope I am going the right way, that sign lets me know I am near BU AND Fenway......Glad you know how COLD it gets in New England and \"get\" the wait til the thaw on the dog poopy info. CAKE, we all have freak outs every now and again. I am old enough to be your mother and it is not fair that you have BC in my opinion. Nor is it fair that I have it. I sometimes wake in the middle of the night and cannot explain the funny feeling I have in my chest. I can breathe fine but I feel like something is going on in  there. Being a nurse, I know it's anxiety but gosh I HATE WHEN THAT HAPPENS..........  DEBORYE, yup, sometimes this is why I love New England.......I am in Maine until Fri and then back to MA. Sat outside doing a crossword puzzle and guzzled about a gallon of water, it was so warm in the sunshine. And I love the sunshine.  EXPRESSIONS, who the heck told you to relax???? I was a wreck last Dec and if anyone said relax I would have smacked them one. Altho I think my breast surgeon said he was positive I would be fine. And he was right. I certainly don't like when docs make \"guesses\", but most have so much experience that I do trust most of them. I think we all on this board know what you are going thru and just how you feel. When I had my surgery, I was SO GLAD that day arrived. My dtr was in tears and I was NOT, I just wanted it DONE. And of course being from New England, and having surgery on Jan 28, IN THE MIDST OF A BLIZZARD just added to the \"fun.\" Right after the surgery, while I was in recovery room (my girls tell me, I was pretty well snockered) the surgeon stopped in to say he was sure the nodes looked fine but being Dana Farber, they wait until the final pathology (might have taken a wk or so) before you get the official call with the news. And it sounds like you have had a lot of mammograms and biopsies, so I will bet your nodes are clear. I think we all on this site understand the agony! And I remember my sisters saying to me, \"for goodness sakes you've had mammos every 6 months for the past 2 yrs, so it couldn't  have spread\" and that really brought me no comfort. But I am telling you to believe it! OK, you can smack me one if you like........... Sheila! This is the BEST site on this site.....we are all nice and there is no bashing. I love it. Thanks, Sue ",

They were talking (last May) about revising the incision but I really hate the thought of any more surgery. I am just fearful that I will \"miss\" any recurrence due to the seroma.

Then I got breast cancer. I reported the cobra vendor to the better business bureau and it was a waste of time as the vendor already had an \"F\" rating. I just googled COBRA AND SSDI and this is the info I want to share. I believe you CAN extend your cobra IF disabled.........(see below) I had many members who were on long term cobra due to this info that I have copied for you........good luck!  Only 25 percent of today's employers offer extended health care benefits to their employees and most employers only offer COBRA protection on disabilities. COBRA legislation mandates that an employee can purchase 18 months of health coverage when leaving a company. However, if a person qualifies for Social Security disability during the first 18 months of COBRA coverage, an additional 11 months of COBRA can be purchased. So, obtaining Social Security disability can provide a person with health care coverage for up to 29 months after a disability occurs. The disabled person, regardless of age, is then eligible for Medicare coverage when COBRA expires. Medicare coverage includes Part A hospital benefits and Part B medical benefits, which, when added to any other health insurance coverage, will increase overall health insurance protection. (Note: Some businesses are exempt from offering COBRA coverage, such as those with not-for-profit status and those with fewer employees than the federally required minimum.)",
