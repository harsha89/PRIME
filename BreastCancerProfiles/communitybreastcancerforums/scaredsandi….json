My breasts are dense and costochondritis prevents the use of mamaograms so I had an MRI. They found a 3cm mass in my right breast. My core biopsy was yesterday so I'm waiting for results and making myself sick with worry. I wish I had gone in to have it checked out sooner. More than likely your pain will turn out to be nothing serious but pain is a symptom that should always be checked out by a professional.",
