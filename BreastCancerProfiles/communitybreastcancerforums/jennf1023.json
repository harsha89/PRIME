Last Wednesday I noticed some discharge from my right breast.  I made an appt with my Dr and she put me on an antibiotic and tested my Thyroid levels, the discharge for infection and Prolactin levels.  Everything came back fine but now I actually have mass the size of a gum ball that I can see and it is red with what looks like capillaries/blood vessels around it the width of a golf ball.  She has me coming in for a mammogram and an ultra sound on Thursday.  I as horrified because she had already tested for the easiest causes.  Has anyone had any experience with this?
