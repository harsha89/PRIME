Almost identical situation with a score of 26, just slightly younger, almost 54. Oncologist & surgeon both agree, professionally, either choice will be right. With a 87% chance of no reoccurrence (which my gut says i\u2019m already there!) not sure the side effects of all the chemo toxins makes sense for 4% pts - tatistically, that\u2019s a rounding error. Leaning towards SAVI radiation and incorporating a healthy diet, holistic benefits daily and removing toxin with an amazingly positive attitude to live life to the fullest every day.",
