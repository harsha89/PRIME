Yesterday I had to have some more testing because of the MRI and I had some swelling below my collarbone that I wanted them to look at. By the time I left there I was changed to Stage IIIC because those node were cancerous. On the first biopsy, it was confirmed that the cancer was in my axillary lymph nodes-she said she saw about 8 on MRI, thought she biopsied only one. The ones below my collarbone was confirmed with ultrasound only-she said no need to do biopsy. I'm reeling! I also was told that it's triple negative.  Now the Stephensons Cancer Center in Oklahoma City has presented my case to their tumor board (?) and I'm waiting for them to call to schedule my PET Scan. I have appointments with surgeon and oncologist and will schedule genetic testing too. Anything else I need to do? Any advise on how to get through these days of waiting",

I also have two walnut sized lumps on either side of my sternum. I called the surgeon and she said it was because she leaves extra skin in case I do reconstruction at some point after radiation. Anyone else have lumps by your sternum?",
