Whle MRI has false positive issues...this type of test may prove to decrease those and fall more into favor.",

Density is a relatively recent addition to breast cancer risk - the biggest thing is it HIDES issues.  After they excised the tumor they found, I did have an MRI that lit up....... I am grateful only LCIS was found after another biopsy, confirming an \"incidental finding\" at my excision biopsy.  Without that doctor (and finding the palpable lump myself) I probably would still be getting those \"congrats!  Your mammogram revealed no issues!\" cards in the mail.",
