I am just dealing with the feelings, unknowns and uncertainty myself and now I have to put on the brave face for others. Don't get me wrong. I am part of a big loving wonderful family. I would feel the same way they feel. I hate to see the fear in their eyes. I have always hated this type of attention and I am not looking forward to this first time with the whole family. I know that they would do anything to take all of this away from me and would literally do anything in the world to make me better. I am just not ready for the attention yet. Just venting.....

I have been feeling pretty nauseous, probably nerves and the gallon of red-cat I had to drink for my cat scan yesterday. So great advice, Thank you! I think I will investigate the caring bridge, or something similar. I thought about checking into something similar. I really like that idea. I think for now I will forget about cancer for the rest of the weekend. It will still be there on Monday when I go to the oncologist and for my bone scan. Best wishes to you as well, Cholesmom. Let's keep in touch.",

I hope that I will have a good response from chemo for the mets like I did for the ibc. Not looking forward to starting chemo again, but I told my MO that I am willing to do whatever is determined to be best to try and get this under control. I knew that I would be dealing with treating new Mets as they came up. I just never dreamed that this would start spreading so fast. Thanks, everyone for the kind words. Joy",

Radiation, SRS as well as Tykerb, Herceptin, Zometa and Fasoldex brought complete resolution of mets at next scan. My next follow up scan was good as well. July of this year my regular 3 month brain MRI showed a new lesion and SRS was again scheduled. When they did the simulation, it was found that there was 4 lesions that needed treatment. I had my follow up bone scan and chest and abdominal CT 2 weeks ago. Bone scan showed new skeletal mets in almost every area! Total of 15 lesions in skull, arms legs, pelvis and spine. Abdominal CT showed at least 10 lesions in my liver. Chest CT shows 2 lesions in my lungs. What the heck! How did this all happen so fast! I see my MO on Thursday. We spoke on the phone about starting chemo again. I will know at the appointment what treatment I will have. I have an infusion appointment on Thursday as my regular appointment. They extended the time to allow for the starting of new meds. I am really stunned at the change in my scans over the last few months. This is the first time that I have really thought that this thing wants to kill me! Has anyone had a similar progression that seemed to come on so fast? What was your experience?

Now I wait. My question is this, when I had my bone scan after initial diagnosis they did a scan down the length of the body. This time they did a scan down the length of the body and then said they needed a couple more pictures. They moved the scanner closer to my body and did a scan of the pelvis and then another of the chest area. Of course my mind goes to \"they must see something\" since they took the other images. Anyone have a bone scan and have them do this. I know I shouldn't make that leap until I get results, but you all know how it is.... Joy",
