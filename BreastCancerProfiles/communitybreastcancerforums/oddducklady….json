I often feel with the abundance of pink, multitude of fund raising groups and publicity that many people feel it's easy to be cured of BC. You see the famous people with BC always seem to look very healthy. Just recently I saw a picture of Joan Lunden on a magazine cover with no hair and she looked really good. Now that photo may have been photoshopped like crazy. I just know at the point my husband had no hair he looked sick and frail (and he was a 6'4\" well built man).  I agree that there doesn't seem to be much publicity or talk about the many that are Stage IV.  It's easy to be discouraged.",

I always thought all the pink was overdone even before he was diagnosed but this year it bothers me more. I also don't think a lot of people realize that Komen does not contribute a lot to finding cures. My husband just started radiation and we have to go out of state and stay there most of the week. While there this week he needed a new pair of shoes and while paying for them the clerk asked us about a contribution- she said they used to collect for Komen but because of some people not being happy with Komen they now collect for the local cancer institute in town. My husband wanted to contribute and his choice of a 'free gift' was lip gloss or a pink pin. I fully realize that BC affects many more women then men. I just want him to live, and since he, like most men, are not diagnosed till a more advanced stage, thus reducing the odds, well all the pink is painful for me. Even if he gets through this now-I know my fear will never go away.",

My husband will finish weekly Abraxane Sept 1 and radiation should start before the end of September. He is not much of a computer person but I have learned a lot here. I am sure when we meet with the RO we will get lots of info and recommendations but I will be interested in what other places recommend and what all of you say is really working in terms of lotions, soaps, creams, etc. I guess I don't have to worry about bras. Didn't even think about possibly needing all cotton shirts. Good grief do they even make all cotton shirts other then white t shirts? Better start looking at labels. Chemo has been a very rough ride with lots of complications. I sure hope radiation is better. Good luck to all of you.",

It doesn't appear to be used that often and I see more people in the Stage IV forums that have it listed. My husband is the one with BC. He was scheduled to begin weekly Taxol in May but that was delayed d/t he developed a infection on his aortic valve and at that time all chemo had to stop to treat it with 6 weeks of abx. Now we are moving toward restarting chemo but our MO (who is just the best) plans to use Abraxane  instead and had it approved by our insurance and everything. I understand it is related to Taxol but he says the SE's are less plus he won't have to use all the steroids which will be safer. Anyone who has personal experience with Abraxane and could share some tips, things for me to help him, watch for, etc, I would be truly grateful. I am doing my best to help him get through this. Thanks.",

First one of a few lymph nodes confirmed they had cancer prior to MX. He had a biopsy another time to confirm crossover mets on opposite side. He had chemo again and they monitored that lymph node for effect as it was still there. I watched both and it was pretty quick and easy (yes I know it wasn't me-but after he was done he drove us out to dinner I think.) Good luck.",
