(I had a core needle biopsy last week and will go for my results tomorrow.) I wanted to respond to this because I have been in the shoes your kids will one day be in. My mom died in 2009 from breast cancer. She was originally diagnosed in 2006. There were 3 of us kids (at the time my twin brothers were 36 and I was 25). Our dad passed away 8 days before our mom from a stroke. Our mom had written all her wishes down sometime after she was diagnosed the first time. She told one of my brothers, the most level-headed one of us, where to find them when the time came. It was a great relief to us to know exactly what she wanted. I think that all parents should do this whether they have a health problem or not. It takes pressure off of the kids because they don't have to guess at what you would want. It also eliminates the possibility of there being disagreement over what to do because you have spelled out what you want. Best of luck to you and I sincerely hope that your children don't have to face this for many years to come!",
