So mostly on these boards you will see everyone making it through with little or no problems - sometimes you will see emotional problems and fatigue and I had that incredibly toward the end and for about 8 weeks afterward.  The skin now just looks tan - but the PS said the blood vessels are destroyed for such an extensive area and she doesn't want to mess with it at all.  I wish you well - know that we understand and talk to us if you need support... I felt very vunerable and found myself truly dealing with the loss while I was going through radiation - and that grief and sense of loss added the whole experience.  I think I was just beginning to grasp what NED really meant as well... and when I began to realize I wasn't going to ever feel \"free\" of BC... that also was floating around the room on that table with me.  The positive... I made it out the other side of all that... I truly am beginning to find peace and a sense of purpose again - and I am beginning to feel pretty and femine again... vs. a burned, battered, bald thing.  You can do it - just go one day at a time and talk to everyone here... they will talk you through.",

And seeing the look of pity and horror at what I look like under my clothes. I cried all the way home...felt so sorry for myself... Ranted I would never feel like I was a real woman ever again... Had a royal meltdown. I am not going back to either place I tried. The foob weighs 2 lbs. I weighed it. I hate it. I have 4 mega bras I don't wear. I am using my old Bali bras too. Otter... There were covers I have three of them that the second store clerk gave me... Your clerk was so full of it. I am going to try one more place this year after the holidays... If they can't help me I will have to learn to help myself. I don't feel confident ordering without trying it on, but by the time you total up the gas and time to these stores... I could have taken a chance on online and sent it back for less.",
