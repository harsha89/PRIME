A port was installed 3 days ago and to our surprise it was placed on the right side just above her mastectomy wound. There seems to be a conflict between the mastectomy surgeon, who says it should have been placed on the left side and thought it was a terrible mistake to place it on the right and that it has a lot of risks and the surgeon who placed the port on the right side. Has anyone experienced something like this? Any ideas? Â All the best to all of you!",
