I had a lumpectomy May 25, and will start radiation on July 10. I am hoping the effects from the radiation won't be too bad, but my left breast is still a little sore since the surgery and I hate to add more damage to an already scarred area. Many of your comments have helped me become somewhat calmer about what to expect. It seems that many come through it without too much difficulty. I will continue to work parttime so I am hoping the fatigue won't be too debilitating. I look forward to gaining more info in the days ahead.",
