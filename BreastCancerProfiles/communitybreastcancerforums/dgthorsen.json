He has give me two choices: a stereotactic biopsy with a clip left in the area, or a needle localization excisional biopsy. I like the less invasive nature of the stereotactic but am slightly concerned about the clip. And thinking there may be a decent chance of needing a surgical biopsy after that anyway. Any thoughts/advice? Log in to post a reply",
