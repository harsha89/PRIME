Yet another sleepless night and it hadn't anything to do with my step son. Since I met him and his dad just over 3 years ago it's been nothing but surgery and bad news after more surgery and bad news. I officially had my father tell me (after not speaking to me for years) that I am the reason he drinks. He said that I'm the reason he became an alcoholic. I had a biopsy in March that mostly came back B9. A few days ago I quit being able to keep anything down and my breast (that was biopsied) has been very painful since the same time. I'm now just \"hanging out\" waiting for my doctor to call. Hopefully all of you can see the sun today! Nay :) Log in to post a reply",
