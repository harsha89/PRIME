Biopsy 1/29. Left on Feb 2 on cruise (best thing ever) 2/18 got the news. Feb 2/26 bi-lateral mastectomy. 3/11 stage 1 no lymph nodes involved. Met with Oncologist and Radiation Oncologist 3/19 & 3/20. First Chemo April 1.  1 Chemo was a breeze, Neulasta shot was killer, pain was like bones exploding. Found Claritin helped. Day 6-7 Did have metal taste in mouth, a little diarrhea, nothing really bothersome  Day 14 my hair started falling out. Day 19 buzzed it off, started wearing a wig  2 Chemo was a breeze, Neulasta had Claritin and Percocet much better. HOWEVER 7 days after Chemo 2 developed a bumpy itchy rash with welts from the back of my neck going up my scalp.  Itchy eye lashes   Driving me crazy. I will have 4 rounds of Chemo every 3 weeks - 2 down 2 to go YEAH",
