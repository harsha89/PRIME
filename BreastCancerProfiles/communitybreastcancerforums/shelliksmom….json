Lori and Traci are missing their sister so much.  Lori couldn't even put her tree up so her husband did.  You girls are so sweet to think about us.  I am looking forward to Jan. 2008....hoping that it gets a little easier.  We miss our sweet Shelli so much.  I can't believe how many \"sisters\" have died since Shelli passed.  I follow Bimmer's story and my heart breaks for him.  I e-mail Geeta often.  She is so beautiful and has a beautiful family.  Geeta's mom e-mailed me a few weeks ago.  I keep coming to this site and noone understands why I do this.  I guess it is because my Shelli still lives on here and I guess it is just a tie for me and comforting to know that you all think about her.  Merry Christmas to all of you.  I pray for you every night.  Thank you Janis.  If I remember right you sent flowers to Shelli's house.

I still pray for all of you at night.  It still comforts me to come to this site.  I printed all of your posts last year and read them all to her.  She always smiled.  You were a very important part of her life.  I keep in touch with Geeta and she is doing well.  God bless all of you.
