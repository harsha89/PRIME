Deedreamer, how do you feel on arimidex, has it changed your life?  Yea for the anniversary. Kelnied, hold on to your faith and you can get through anything. Spunkygirl, that is so sad that your husband is still battleing this beast.  Is he on chemo still?  So glad you are doing well.  May I add you all in my prayers.  God bless you all.",
