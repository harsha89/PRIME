I finished my rads almost two years ago, but still say that it was the best part of the worst part of my life because of the technicians who became my dear friends and supporters. A couple of years ago, the words to the Camp Nukemboobies theme song was posted here. It was to the tune of \"Camp Granada\" and oh so funny. I have been asked to \"perform\" this song at an awareness event in a couple of months. If any of you have this, please let me know!
