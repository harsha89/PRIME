A couple of friends are pushing me to get second opinions, but so far my medical team has been fabulous, and my BC surgeon seems to be one of the best in L.A., and the pathology report is pretty darn clear.  js37, you're 14 years younger than me. I totally get why you don't want chemo. I don't either-- I'm 500 times more scared of it than I was of my surgery two weeks ago. But you're young and don't want this back. It seems like you have to give it very serious consideration. I have several friends who went through it just fine for various kinds of cancer and are doing great.  I'm going to do it, not happily, but I just don't see a choice... ",

      "Content": "Aug 5, 2010 10:30PM - edited Aug 5, 2010 10:31PM by writer Hey all, I'm jumping in very late in the game. I've been involved on the TCH and Feb. chemo boards and kinda forgot to look into the radiation ones. I'm done with the main zapping and have daily boosts to the surgery area until a week from tomorrow. It was really helpful to read the tip about the yeast-infection medication-- makes sense. I'm trying that tomorrow. My cancer breast (left) has held up really well-- it's swollen but isn't bothering me, and I guess it's good I still don't have any nipple sensation post-surgery (I had a pretty major lumpectomy), because I'm not feeling any discomfort there! But my chest is a red, bumpy, horribly itchy mess. I'm using three things: Udder Cream, Cortaid and Benadryl cream... the Cortaid did nothing for the itching, but the Benadryl helps with that. I'm using Cortaid anyway in hopes it will keep the rash from getting even worse. But hopefully it will start to calm next week, now that I'm in the home stretch. Otherwise it hasn't been bad. Curiously I got really tired for a few nights about halfway through, but then my normal energy returned. Haven't been tired lately. Mostly I just want my life back.... everyone keeps saying \"how great,' you're done,\" because chemo's over and I have a quarter-inch of hair. But radiation ain't nothing, as you all know, and I still go to \"chemo\" to get infusions of Herceptin and Avastin every three weeks, until February. And then I think I get to have Fun With Tamoxifen. But it all works, so that's the good news. Nice to meet you all. Colleen ",

But Julie50, yes, I have the one giant nipple... kind of creepy, but hopefully temporary! The whole breast is swollen... my plastic surgeon left the cancer side a little smaller than the reconstructed side (I had reconstruction to even me out, because they had to take out so much tissue on the cancer side) on purpose, because I guess some of the swelling is permanent, but hopefully not the nipple. My energy's been pretty good, but last night when we were out to dinner with friends, having a good time, I just hit the wall and had to leave. I've NEVER had to do that, always rally for social things. But I'd had a busy work day and busy week, and I guess the radiation effects are building (I've had 5 weeks of it, with 1 week to go). I spent almost 10 hours in bed! I haven't done that in many many years... I'm just like my kids now! (They're 17 and 20 and can sleep forever.) Itchy rash continues to torture... hoping to starts to fade in a couple of days, now that I'm just on boosts.",

When I got the news yesterday about having not just DCIS but also IDC (grade 3 across the board, HR2+), which means chemo, my mother and oldest daughter fell apart. It kills me to see my 74-year-old mother so scared for her 51-year-old daughter-- I guess we go right back to being kids. And then I have a college girl and a high school girl (and a husband) to keep from being overly stressed and scared. Have any of you dealt with that?",

And such a glorious day in Pasadena (and all over L.A.). Good luck with the next round and the hair loss. Was out seeing Avatar and having dinner with my husband, kids and some friends, and they were all having fun discussing how I should cut my hair to prep for chemo. It's a relief to see my high school daughter able to have fun with these more light-hearted conversations (she's a theater girl and is excited about wig shopping). The college girl gets a little more freaked out, but she's starting to adapt. Bluedasher, thanks for the positive words. Damn straight, as hard as it is/will be in terms of what we have to go through, it's nowhere near like stage 4. We'll all be fine. As I keep telling my kids. Colleen ",

My BC surgeon is Jeannie Shen and oncologist (who I have yet to meet) is Steven Applebaum, both at Huntington but also UCLA, and both worked with Dennis Slamon. You're right, the study is Avastin. Since the shock has faded from Wednesday's newest diagnosis, I have been working hard on getting an AA-level degree in Her2-positive breast cancer. (I used to write a lot of medical/health stories for national magazines, so one thing I know how to do is research and translate jargon-dense information into understandable bits.) Are you in the middle of chemo now? Are you doing carboplatin and taxo with Herceptin?  It sounds like what I'm headed for. Would love to know if that's what you're doing and how you're feeling. I am starting to accept some parts of my future, like hair loss (but the eyebrows! OMG!). But it's hard to get an estimate of how much work I will be able to accomplish (I have my own business) and if I will be able to manage a long-planned, much-anticipated college-hunt trip with my daughter while in the middle of the chemo thing. Anyway, nice to meet you, if under unhappy circumstances. ",

Some thought I should cancel because of what I've been through -- DCIS diagnosis for Halloween, major lumpectomy and reconstruction a week before Christmas, diagnosis yesterday (a total shock) of IDC grade 3+3+3, Her2+. I'm still reeling and scared and disbelieving,not to mentioned worried about my teenagers and my husband and my parents, but if there was ever a time I needed to be with my closest friends, it's tonight, to help ring in a new year that will not bring a lot of fun but will certainly bring good health.  Anyway, this forum has been a great source as I seek knowledge about my new life. Thanks to all. ",

It looked like lumpectomy and radiation, no big deal, so it seemed. I've now had the lumpectomy (a big one) and got through it just fine. Felt totally positive, barely gave a moment's thought to the pathology report, which I was so convinced would be peachy. But it's not-- invasive cells showed up, grade 3 in every category, so I'm headed down the bald-headed path. Still not worried about the long run, but I can't say I'm too happy about what the next six months will bring. And so sad that my family has to now see that and worry.   But I'm glad I wasn't worrying about the path report, because that meant I had a happy Christmas and an easier time recovering. I don't believe in \"forcing\" positivity, but that's my natural state of being. It's left me for today, of course, but I know it will return. ",
