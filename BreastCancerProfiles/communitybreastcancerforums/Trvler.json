I don't want to scare you but I had an mammogram and ultrasound in 2013 because of pain. They didn't find anything. So a year later when I was having throbbing pain in the same place, I went back again. My OB said 'it doesn't present like cancer' but gave me an u/s order anyway. I sat on it for 6 months because he convinced me it was nothing. Well, it turned out to be something. I went to get a second opinion somewhere else because I didn't agree with the original BS. He wanted me to get lx with rads. The second place wanted more imaging, which I thought was a waste. But they found more areas of cancer in the same breast and recommended a mx. My point is, the first place wasn't very thorough in their imaging. The first place wasn't making me miserable with the mammogram. I had implants and imaging was hard. The second place was killing me, but they were much better at imaging. I would get a second opinion. While it might be a pain, you will not be worried if it comes out ok. And it if is something, you will be glad you did it.",

He advised lx and said my 30 year old implants would be fine, expect when they radiated them I would probably have to have a second surgery to remove the scar tissue. Other doctors said 30 year implants should come out. So I went to see another BS at the same facility that someone recommended. I felt more repoire with him but he essentially told me the first guy was a better doctor. To me the implication was you get the first guy you go to see. So I sought out another BS opinion from another recommendation a big teaching university hospital. THAT surgeon was dismissive when I mentioned I might be going to NOLA. They just don't like it when you don't give their place all the business. When I went to that third surgeon, she had more imaging done that was WAY more thorough. I have since discussed the first place with other people had some negative things to say about them too.",

More likely than not, you have time. I think many women who could easily have a lx do that and then later regret it. Have you read any of the threads about making a decision about lx vs mx? As an example, my tumor is 3 cm. I asked my doctor if I could wait until early April to have surgery because we had plans for spring break. He said yes. As you read on here, you will see that your tumor is relatively small. Also, notice the people's signatures and see what treatments people who have your same diagnosis are getting. That should help you know a little about what to expect.",

I think some surgeons approach is to go in for the most minimally invasive surgery possible and it's no big deal if they have to do a second surgery. To some extent, I get that. But I had other issues I was dealing with at the same time, like my breasts are really small and I figured a lx of that size would really disfigure me.",

But also, the TYPE of cancer is important, although a couple of the doctors I initially saw dismissed it. For example, I had ILC as opposed to IDC. ILC can be harder to detect so for me. A LX wouldn't have gotten the original tumor(s). It was also multifocal meaning I had it in a few locations. The original facility, quite frankly, did a terrible job of diagnosing me. The second opinion place wanted more imaging and biopsies in the same breast. I thought, what's the point. But they found more cancer leading me to my decision to have a mx.",

Your dx is not bad. ( I mean yes, cancer is bad) But you are VERY early. I think a lot of women immediately want to go for the mx thinking that gives them a much better outcome but studies show equal outcomes when there is no node involvement. You don't HAVE to have a mx.

So I went and saw a second breast surgeon who did MORE imaging and found more areas of cancer in the same breast. I asked why she did more imaging and she said because her philosophy on surgery was 'one and done' whereas the first one would have done at least two surgeries or at some point I would have been diagnosed with a \"recurrence.\" My point is that different facilities can produce different results and if you are concerned, get it checked out somewhere else.",

I would also encourage you to spend as much time as you have reading on here and learning what you can. You will have to be an advocate for yourself throughout your process. Are you going to have an MRI? There is a great thread about lumpectomy vs. mastectomy. I would encourage you to read it and think about what your priorities are when you have your surgery. A lot of women have a natural first instinct to do one thing or another. For example, a lot of women think their odds of survival are higher with a mastectomy when studies show that the odds are equal with both a mx and lx with rads. So then you have to consider what other factors are important to you. For example, my first BS recommended a lx with rads. I have breast implants that are 30 years old and I have been told for years that they don't last forever. Also, my own breasts are very small so a lx is going to likely disfigure me pretty good. When I mentioned that to my first surgeon, he was completely dismissive about my concerns. So he is no longer my BS. You don't mention if you are estrogen or progesterone positive or not but if you are, they will likely want you to take hormone blockers. Are you pre or post menopausal? Let me know if you can't find the thread on lx or mx and I will find it for you. Hang in there. You will feel better when you know what your plan is. But don't rush into it. A lot of women rush to make a decision and end up regretting what they chose.",

They will give you earplugs to cancel out the noise. I HATE earphones. They make me more claustrophobic. I like 70's disco so I asked for music. They might try to rush you. Wait until YOU are ready to go in. Do not let them rush you. Test to see if you are completely comfortable and ready before going in. Fix whatever it is that you are no comfortable with. I could tell I was going to be hot so I asked them to take my socks off. Remember, the most important thing is YOUR comfort not their schedule. You can do it. THEY don't give you the drugs.You need to have your doctor prescribe them. Have someone drive you home.",

Why do some people have 19 and some have 33 and some (like me) have 28? Also, I am confused on applying topical stuff. I see people recommending all kind of oils and creams and aquaphor. When do you apply all this stuff? If you put oil on, won't it keep the aquaphor from being absorbed? I just don't know when to put on all of this stuff. My doctor said deodorant is ok as long as it is not 4 hours before treatment. I have been putting it on after. Why are people using Toms? I don't think Secret has any aluminum in it? I looked at the label. I am being radiated in my armpit. I have been putting on aquaphor after treatment and at night but it never dries out. Is that good? It's kind of gross. Does anyone else have VERY naturally dry, sensitive skin? How are you faring?",

I can't imagine having all my friends thinking everything I was doing was the cause. I would tell them to shut the F up, but that's just me. I just politely tell them I am not changing my diet, or stopping using deodorant or any of the other things they are sure are killing me. Funny they know but science doesn't. It's like when I worked for a pension consulting firm and everyone and their brother had a stock tip. After a while you realize they don't know any more than you do.

Could it be worse? I don't know. They also keep pointing out they are open next Sunday. Maybe I will skip Friday and go Sunday. I can then be done the Tuesday before TG instead of the Wed. If I don't skip Friday, I could be done on the Monday. I guess I will see how much more miserable I am Thursday and decide then.",

I love hearing about everyone's travel plans. I am dying to go to Italy but between kids' school schedule and husbands work calendar, it is hard to figure out when. I took the kids out of school last time we went and it gets harder to do that as they get older. But I think I might do it next fall. If this whole thing has made me realize anything it is that you can't wait to do stuff. I am going for #12/28 today and yesterday I was getting really pink and itchy and I put that calendula cream on a couple of times and it really seems to help. I can handle the stinky smell if it keeps the itching at bay. I HATE itching.",

When I mentioned this to the doctors, they didn't really know what to do. They checked me for a blood clot and listened to my heart and lungs. I guess there wasn't much else they could do.

I don't think I could have survived chemo without my group. We are still Facebook friends today and the group takes trips together. I haven't been able to go because my kids are 12 and 13. You will know down to the day almost when your hair will fall out and what to do about every side effect you can get. (You won't likely get all of them). My best advice during chemo is to exercise daily if you can. It saved me mentally and physically. Eat what you want. I ate a lot of liver. :) I know. Most people think gross but that's what I craved.",
