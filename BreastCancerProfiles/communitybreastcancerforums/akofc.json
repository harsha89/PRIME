They changed my anti nausea meds for 2nd treatment so some parts were better. Nothing tastes good but I have better handle on all my stomach issues now. Really messed me up first round. I am on adriamycin and cytoxan but now that they know I have IBC and triple neg doctor wants to see me in a week to look for any physical improvement and may change my chemo plan. Nervous cause I keep reading about bone pain. I like days of chemo cause I feel like I am able to fight this disease. I am only 41 and was having so much fun. So much for summer...... Nice to meet you all. Sorry for the circumstance. My prayers are with each of you....",
