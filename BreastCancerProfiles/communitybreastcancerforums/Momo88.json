I made an appointment with a surgery center for a biopsy (which I am not even sure is possible yet...), but anyway, she said the surgeon was a general surgeon who had experience with breasts. When I called the breast center, they told me to cancel that appointment and get a breast surgeon. I call back the original surgery center and explained this to them, this time I'm speaking to a different receptionist, and she says the surgeon is a general surgeon who specializes in breasts and that there is no difference between a breast surgeon and a general surgeon who specialized in breasts? Is this accurate?? Log in to post a reply",
