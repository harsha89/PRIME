I would give anything for this not to have happened to her. I went for my mammogram last week Friday. I haven't been to one in years. They called me to return. They said that they saw a thickening in my breast. I just can't believe this is happening. I haven't told my mother. I have to be supportive of her. Her surgery may be on Wednesday depending on what her doctor says. I have so many fears. I don't know where to begin. I'm scared for my mother. I want her to be healthy. She has such beautiful hair. I don't want her to lose her hair. I know it's going to happen. I have to be strong for her. I just love her so much. I can't believe this is happening. Now, I have to wait until December 16th to find out what is wrong with me. I'm going crazy. I'm scared. Oh well...I just needed to vent. Thank you & God bless Log in to post a reply",

When I arrived at home, I had a message that they wanted me to see a cancer surgeon.  I was on the phone on and off today, but I could not find out why they changed their minds.   I would prefer just to have a biopsy now.  If you can tell, I'm going a little crazy.  I don't know what to do.   I will continue to keep you all up to date.  Please keep me in your prayers.",

I'm just trying to be there for her. Now, I have to deal with going to my ultrasound on Tuesday. Thank you all again for your support.",

Thank you all for being so encouraging.  I'm trying to keep the faith, but I'm so scared. ",
