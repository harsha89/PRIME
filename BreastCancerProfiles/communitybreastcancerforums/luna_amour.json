      "Content": "luna_amour wrote: hello everyone my name is Ewi (nickname). I'm 18 years old and I love my grandma. unfortunately, over the years she has accumulated health complications starting from diabetes to kidney failure to open heart surgery and now stage 2 breast cancer. when I first found out I stated to my grandma, \"Nuh uh...this is impossible. are you joking around?\" Wishing this was true, it wasn't. My grandma felt a lump a week ago on her left breast and told my grandpa she wanted to see a doctor ASAP. they did tests and did find out he lump was a tumor in her breast. today with my aunts, we went to the hospital and the doctors and specialists did CT scans, ultrasounds, and so on. anyways, the doctor felt another SEPARATE tumor underneath her left breast. also, the doctor was also worried that the lump underneath her armpit could have been cancerous. being that she has pre-exsisting health issues, if the cancer was to be found anywhere else on her body OR on the armpit, chemo would be too much on her tied with dialysis. it is all too much to take in. all I know is having faith in God and praying all is well. :) Log in to post a reply",
