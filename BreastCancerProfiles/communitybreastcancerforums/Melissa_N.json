It is in the crease where your arm bends.  I had just had major weight loss surgery when I noticed it and thought it was from the surgery or deoderent or something. I honestly forgot about it.  Two weeks ago I \"found it again\" and decided to see the my PCP.  She did a breast exam and said my breast are lumpy and then examined the enlarged lymph node.  There is no pain, it is hard and fixed in place.  She said she wanted me to go ahead and have it biopsied since it has been there for 3 months.  She is also having me get a sono of my right breast.  She didn't think they will let me have a mammo at my age.  I have the sono established for Friday and I see the surgeon the same day.  I don't know if he will be doing the biopsy or not. I am scared and don't know what to expect or when the result will be in.  So it may be a couple of weeks before I get an answer. Log in to post a reply",
