      "Content": "luvmygirls3 wrote: I have a 1.5 cm mass that is right at chest wall. I went in yesterday for an MRI core needle biopsy, but after being in the machine for over an hour, the radiologist pulled me out to tell me that he was really sorry, but that he would not be able to get a useful sample of the tumor suitable for biopsy b/c of its position way back near chest wall, and I would have to have an excisional biopsy. It would have been nice for the MRI biopsy to work, but I am ok with the excisional biopsy. Has anyone had an excisional biopsy of a mass that is back against the chest wall? Does that make the surgery more invasive and the recovery/ scarring any worse? However, I was given  great ray of hope when the radiologist told me yesterday in our pre-MRI biopsy meeting that while he could never guarantee for sure of course, that it was his opinion that the mass had a good chance of being benign, and that he would be surprised if it was cancer ( although he was quick to warn me of course that he has been surprised by results, but not often). When we met after the biopsy yesterday, he told me that the new pictures he had taken yesterday in the attempted MRI biopsy made him even less concerned about the mass than he had been before. However, he did remain confident that I did need the excisional biopsy. I go for my consultation with breast surgeon tomorrow and they said we will hope to schedule surgery in next 3 weeks. While the prospect of surgery is never great, I just feel more hopeful than I did. WDYT?? Log in to post a reply",

Dr. only told me that if this thing is B9, it will be a fibroadenoma. I don't know what it will be then if it is malignent - I guess just cancer - no other fancy name?? Nothing else of concern was found in the breasts ( I do have other seemingly b9 things that have been there for a while and that I monitor with mammo & ultrasound every 6 months). They scheduled me for an MRI-guided biopsy one week from today. Questions: 1. What are the chances that this thing is b9 with its abnormal shape/border  - can something with abnormal border (not smooth) shape be B9? 2. What is the MRI biopsy like? Does it hurt? 3. what might be next steps in either situation - b9 or malignant (besides obvious trip to breast surgeon)? Thank you Pls. tell me anything else you know about this scenario. So not excited for this waiting game now. Log in to post a reply",
