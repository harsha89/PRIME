It was my first mammo..I went because I was 40.  I was in great shape, so I thought I would have rebounded right back, since my PS said the recovery would have been about 4 weeks.  I just checked out this website today and saw all of your comments and see how some of you have struggled and think that everyone does heal differently.  But I really feel like a whiner when I leave the doctor's office because I am not 100% yet.  I'm on tamoxifen and was wondering if that is contributing to me not healing as well.  I'm finally getting my expander out on 1/27 and the permanent implant in under the back muscle that is now covering it.  I am hoping that will relieve some of my chest pain.  Has anyone had this procedure and dealt with any of this?  I am so frustrated.
