Although this is not the news you wanted to hear, you will get through it.  In the end we do what we have to do.  You will accept what you are told and make the best treatment decisions you can.  I know what a shock this is for you but the best thing you can do is take one step at a time.

IDC, DCIS, 1.7 cm, grade 3.  All my doctors felt lumpectomy would be the way to go and I also wanted it done ASAP.  I had the lumpectomy with SNB, 0/3 nodes.  Five days after my surgery we had a hurricane.  I was so glad that the cancer was gone.  Due to the hurricane, I was unable to see any doctor or get any results for at least a week.  When things finally reopened I found out that the margins were not clear and they recommended mastectomy.  I had to go through this again.  I decided on a bilateral with immediate reconstruction.  then another hurricane hit.  We had serious damage and everything was closed.  There was no power or phone service for days.  I could not schedule anything!  It was truly a nightmare.  I still had cancer and could do nothing about it. Finally, things got back to normal.  I had the lumpectomy in September and did not have the mastectomy until November.  My final pathology showed that I had multi-focal disease.  Two small areas on the other side of the breast were invasive, extensive DCIS and LCIS.  The original area was smaller than originally thought.  These areas did not show up on the MRI, no one knew about them.  I am so thankful my original margins were not clear because none of this would have been discovered.  My doctor said that I would have been back in about two years. My point is that although you feel rushed, try to take a step back and look at the big picture.  I was forced to wait and it was awful.  In the end, it did all work out and I am very happy with the decisions I made. I wish you well on this difficult journey. Lenore",

I did this once and did not want to have to do it again.  I also never felt like I lost my breasts.  I do still think about having cancer, but I never think about the breasts I have now not being my \"orginals\".
