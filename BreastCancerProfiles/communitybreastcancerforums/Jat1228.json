At that point I felt I had to be honest and tell what was going on. I also asked both how they would like it to be handled in the future if I had to have medical testing. Did they want to know about it before or after the results. Both said before, that they would be upset to find out after.",

I keep going back and forth as to what and when to tell them. My situation is, I had a 3D mammogram yesterday. I'm 58 and this is the first mammogram in 17 years (no lectures please, I know better). I got a call yesterday saying they needed to do a diagnostic mammogram and possible ultrasound. I went in today for that. They did the mammogram, skipped the ultrasound and went straight to scheduling a needle biopsy next week. Part of me wants to tell them now so that if the results are bad, that news won't come out of the blue. The other part doesn't want to tell them because if the results are good, there's no need to say anything. I know statistics are in favor of a good outcome, but the radiologist was so negative sounding. I don't have any palpable lumps, so I'm hoping that if the biopsy is positive for cancer, that it's been caught early. Thanks for any insight you can give me. Log in to post a reply",
