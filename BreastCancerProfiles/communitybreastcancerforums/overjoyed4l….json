In the beginning I was just like you, scared to death. If you would read some of my past postings you would see the panic in my writings. As time has passed it has gotten a lot easier to deal with. What a difference 2 1/2 years make. I celebrated my 50th birthday, and my 20th wedding anniversary. Now, I am just on Aromasin daily and Zometa every three months.  Don't read any of those stupid prognosis statistics, I HAVE NOT had a recurrence or mets. Get lots of rest. Eat several small snacks per day.  Drink lots of water, water, water to flush the body.  Stay positive!!!! You will survive this!!!!!  Hugs and Blessings Sharon",
