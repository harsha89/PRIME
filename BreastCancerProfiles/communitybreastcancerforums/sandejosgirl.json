Then: I am coming up on 3 years post treatment (dec) and over the last year have had my EF drop from 59 last Oct to 45 this Oct.  I did dose dense AC-T and rads and am well aware that chemo/rads cause heart damage lol.  I am currently an active, normal weight 36 yr old, low BP, low triglycerides, etc. Do folks have any recommendations of places to look for information?  I mean other than the general crap, I mean knowledge, on websites.  More than the one page, blah blah chemo can cause heart failure... I am in the process of looking for a second opinion because the cardiologist I saw 2 weeks ago clearly was more used to dealing with overweight 65 yr old males.  I asked about exercise, cause when I try to run I feel like my head is going to exploded, and he was like, \"Yeah, that's good for you.\"  Not my cup of tea for a doc.
