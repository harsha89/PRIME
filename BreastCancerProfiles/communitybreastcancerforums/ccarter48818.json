I've been dealing with BC since March of 06, I am 48 now, when I was diagnosed at stage 4 with extensive bone mets.  I have dealt with it all this time with the little hope that bone mets weren't so terrible, but now lung mets?  I'm shaking in my shoes.   Will post back after the appointment for your opinions on my doctor's choice of treatment.  I am so grateful to have all of you here.

The psychiatrist said I could be hospitalized, but I don't know what good that would do.  What can they do for me there besides making sure I don't hurt myself. Has anyone here come back from severe depression; I'm desperate for help? Hugs, Carla Dx 3/3/2006, IDC, 3cm, Stage IV, Grade 3, 4/4 nodes, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
